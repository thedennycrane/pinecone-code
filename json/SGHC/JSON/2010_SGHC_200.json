        "Background Facts": "1       The Appellant, Festina Lotus S.A, is the\n                    proprietor of trade marks which are variations of “FESTINA and\n                    device” (“Appellant’s various marks”) in Singapore in\n                    Classes 3, 9, 14, 16, 18 and 25 ICGS. The Respondent, Romanson Co. Ltd,\n                    filed a trade mark application for “J.ESTINA and device”\n                    (“Respondent’s mark”) by way of trade mark application\n                    number T05/25465Z with respect to Class 14 in relation to “wrist\n                    watches, electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings,\n                    bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” (“Respondent’s\n                    application”).

        "Facts pertaining to the Appellant": "3       The Appellant’s trade mark in respect of\n                    Class 14 was registered in Singapore under trade mark number T9004265I\n                    (“Appellant’s mark 1”). The Appellant’s mark 1 is a\n                    composite mark made up of a crest with the following elements: (a)A crown device positioned on top of the\n                            crest;(b)Two prancing horses positioned on the sides of\n                            the crest;(c)A curved banner positioned at the bottom of the\n                            crest with the word “FESTINA” emblazoned across the curved\n                            banner.4       The Appellant’s marks in respect of\n                    Classes 9, 18 and 25 (“Appellant’s other marks”)\n                    consist of the same device as described above with the addition of the word\n                    “FESTINA” in larger, bold font as a plain word mark positioned at\n                    the bottom of the device.

The brand “FESTINA” was said to be one of\n                    the leaders in the mid-range watch sector in markets in Europe and currently\n                    distributes and sells watches and time pieces in more than 50 countries\n                    worldwide. It also sponsors professional cycling events and is the official time\n                    keeper of the Tour de France, amongst others. The Appellant also tendered\n                    evidence of its annual turnover and copies of selected invoices attesting to\n                    sales where it has a presence in East Asia,ie, in\n                    Hong Kong and Japan. There are no specific sales figures available for Singapore\n                    as the Appellant’s various marks have not been used here.Facts pertaining to the Respondent6       The Respondent’s mark, on the other hand,\n                    consists of the word “J.ESTINA” with a crown device positioned on\n                    the top of it as seen below:7       In a Statutory Declaration made by the General\n                    Manager of “J.ESTINA” division of the Respondent,\n                    Mr. Myoung-chul Shin, it was deposed that the Respondent is a South Korean\n                    manufacturer of watches established in April 1998. The watches manufactured\n                    include luxury jewellery watches, prestige-grade watches, business watches,\n                    fashionable watches and casual watches.8       The Respondent ventured into the jewellery\n                    market in 2002. On 16 December 2005, it filed for registration of the\n                    Respondent’s mark by way of application number T05/25465Z for\n                    Class 14 goods with respect to “wrist watches, electric watches,\n                    desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, ring bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                    brooches” in Singapore. As the Respondent’s mark has not been used\n                    here, the Respondent tendered evidence of approximate sales value of jewellery,\n                    watches and horological articles under the Respondent’s mark in countries\n                    such as China and Vietnam.The decision of the PARPAR’s findings with respect to s 8(2)(b) TMA9       Section 8(2)(b)\n                    TMA reads as follow:Relative grounds for refusal of\n                        registration8. — (1)(2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because —…(b) it issimilar to an earlier trade markand is to be registered forgoods or services identical\n                            with or similar tothose for which the earlier trade mark is\n                        protected,thereexists a likelihood of confusionon\n                        the part of the public.[emphasis added]10     The PAR found that:(a)The Appellant’s mark 1 was the relevant\n                            “earlier trade mark” for the purposes of\n                                s 8(2)(b) TMA. The\n                            Appellant’s other marks were therefore not considered, at [53] of\n                            GD;(b)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were visually dissimilar, at [59] of\n                        GD;(c)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were aurally similar, at [61] of\n                        GD;(d)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were conceptually dissimilar, at [64] of\n                            GD;(e)The goods in the Respondent’s application\n                            in respect of “wrist watches, electric watches, desk clocks,\n                            alarm clocks” were identical to the Appellant’s registered\n                            goods in Class 14,ie,\n                            “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, at\n                            [71] of GD;(f)The goods in the Respondent’s application\n                            in respect of “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                            brooches” were similar to those of the Appellant’s\n                            registered goods in Class 14,ie,\n                            “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, at\n                            [73] of GD;(g)There was no likelihood of confusion between the\n                            Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark, at [84] of\n                            GD.Accordingly, the appellant failed on this ground of\n                opposition.PAR’s findings with respect to s 7(6) TMA11     Section 7(6) TMA stipulates:Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration7. — (1) ...(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith.The PAR found that the evidence tendered before her did not show that\n                    the Respondent’s actions fell short of the standards of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    area of trade, at [113] of GD. Thus, the Appellant’s opposition under bad\n                    faith failed.The Appellant’s submissions on appeal12     The Appellant submitted that there are visual,\n                    aural and conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.13     The Appellant’s approach during the\n                    course of submissions was a strategic one. It first sought to demonstrate that\n                    the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25,ie,\n                    those which the Appellant’s various trade marks were registered under,\n                    could be broadly and rationally categorised as “fashion\n                    accessories”. Flowing from this logic, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent’s goods in Class 14 wereat\n                        leastsimilar to the Appellant’s goods in respect of\n                    Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25 as they were all “fashion\n                    accessories”. The implication of such, as submitted by the Appellant, was\n                    that the relevant “earlier mark” for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA included not only the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 (as held by the PAR) but also the Appellant’s\n                    other marks. This was crucial to strengthening the Appellant’s case as the\n                    Appellant’s other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) bore\n                    greater visual similarity to the Respondent’s mark, a point conceded by\n                    the Respondent.14     Applying the global appreciation test, the\n                    Appellant took the position that a likelihood of confusion existed on the part\n                    of the public between the Respondent’s mark and the Appellant’s mark\n                    1 (and the Appellant’s other marks if the Court accepts the\n                    Appellant’s submission above) within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA.15     For the claim of bad faith under s 7(6)\n                    TMA, the Appellant submitted that the PAR erred in finding that there was no bad\n                    faith on the Respondent’s part. The Appellant submitted that Respondent\n                    was very likely to have been aware of the Appellant’s mark and its\n                    reputation. This, compounded by the Respondent’s failure to respond by way\n                    of counterstatement to the allegation of bad faith and the unsatisfactory\n                    explanation given by the Respondent regarding the derivation of the brand name\n                    “J.ESTINA” suggested that the Respondent must have copied the\n                    Appellant’s mark. Thus, the application to register the Respondent’s\n                    mark in such circumstances must have been made in bad faith.The Respondent’s submissions on appeal16     The Respondent took the view that the\n                    Appellant’s appeal against the PAR’s findings in respect of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA was misconceived. Faced\n                    with the Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9,\n                    14, 18 and 25 as being similar in nature which would entitle the court to\n                    consider the Appellant’s other marks, the Respondent submitted that there\n                    was no overlap between the specification of goods for the Appellant’s\n                    marks in Classes 9, 18 and 25 with that of the Respondent’s\n                    Class 14 goods. Hence, the Respondent maintained that the relevant\n                    “earlier mark” that the court was entitled to consider was\n                    confined to the Appellant’s mark 1 for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.17     The Respondent also submitted that there were\n                    no visual, aural or conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s and\n                    Respondent’s marks and that there was no likelihood of confusion between\n                    the two marks.18     Given its stance that the two marks were\n                    completely different, the Respondent submitted that there was no issue of bad\n                    faith that needed to be addressed. As the Appellant had provided no distinct\n                    proof of unacceptable commercial behaviour, its claim against the Respondent in\n                    respect of bad faith under s 7(6) TMA must necessarily fail.Decision of the courtStandard of Review of Present Proceedings19     Order 87 rule 4 Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                    R 5, 2006, Rev Ed) (“ROC”) applies to appeals against the\n                    decision of the Trade Marks PAR pursuant to s 75(2)(a) TMA.

The fact that a sign is\n                        similar to a registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be\n                        a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                        fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                        circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter of\n                        degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between a mark\n                        and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not\n                            satisfied there will not be any need to go into the third question of\n                            determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does\n                            it mean that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on\n                            similar goods, that there willipso factobe confusion in the minds of the public. If that was\n                        intended, s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                        phrased differently. As presently worded,there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are\n                            present. …[emphasis added]Condition 1: Similarity of marks25     The Respondent’s mark and the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 are both composite marks which consist of a pictorial\n                    element and a word element. The two marks are as follow:Respondent’s markAppellant’s mark 1The decided cases suggest that there are three aspects to similarity:\n                    visual, aural and conceptual. Whether there is a similarity of marks in these\n                    three aspects is essentially a question of fact, seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at [9].26     As noted in[10]above, the PAR found that these two marks were aurally\n                    similar but were not visually and conceptually similar.(1)   Visual Similarity27     The Appellant submitted that the PAR had erred\n                    in concluding that the two marks were visually dissimilar. It was accepted that\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 was a composite mark consisting of a crest device\n                    with the word “FESTINA” emblazoned across the curved banner below\n                    the pictorial element.28     The PAR at [57] and [58] of the GD made a\n                    comparison between the two marks and found:(a)In relation to the Respondent’s mark,\n                            “J.ESTINA” was a dominant component as the word\n                            “J.ESTINA” constituted half or more of the\n                            Respondent’s mark. As for the crown device, it was much smaller in\n                            size in relation to the word “J.ESTINA”.(b)As for the Appellant’s mark 1, the crest\n                            formed the dominant component while the word “FESTINA” was\n                            subsumed within the curved banner of the crest. It was opined that\n                            crests were normally intricately designed with complicated elements such\n                            that, generally, consumers would not be able to recall their exact\n                            details save for the impression that the crest was part of the\n                            mark.29     It was the Appellant’s submission that\n                    crests and coats-of-arms are nowadays commonly used on a wide variety of goods\n                    ranging from watches, foodstuffs and beverages. It was said that the\n                    consumers’ eyes are usually drawn to the words in such a mark in order to\n                    ascertain the origin of the goods. In other words, even where a crest forms a\n                    dominant part of the trade mark, it will have a “negligible\n                    effect” when the average consumer recalls the trade mark. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 would be remembered and accordingly be described as\n                    “FESTINA” (ie, word element) since\n                    the crest element (ie, pictorial element) cannot\n                    be verbalized. This, combined with the imperfect recollection of an average\n                    consumer, in terms of visual recognition, is likely to militate against\n                    distinguishing between the two marks “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.30     The European Court of Justice\n                    (“ECJ”) has emphasised that the assessment of similarity between\n                    two marks must be based on the overall impression created by them, in\n                    particular, of their distinctive and dominant components, seeSabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport, Case C-251/95\n                    [1997] ECR I- 6191 andLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v\n                        Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343.\n                    Thus, in deciding whether there are visual similarities between the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark, I agree with the PAR\n                    that with respect to the Respondent’s mark, the word\n                    “J.ESTINA” formed the dominant part of the mark whereas for the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1, the crest was the dominant aspect f. To this extent,\n                    there is no visual similarity between the two marks.31     The Appellant submitted that there are\n                    instances whereby the overall impression conveyed to the relevant public by a\n                    composite mark may be dominated by one or more of its components, seeMatratzen Concord GmbH v OHIM, Case T- 6/01\n                    [2002] ECR II-4335 at [32].Medion AG v Thomson\n                        Multimedia Sales Germany & Austria GmbH, Case C- 120/04\n                    [2005] ECR I-8551 (“Medion”) was also cited by the\n                    Appellant as authority that it is still possible that a non-dominant component\n                    of a composite mark might have an independent distinctive role in the composite\n                    mark, see [30] ofMedion. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s position was that even if “FESTINA” was not the\n                    dominant element of the Appellant’s mark 1, its distinctive role would\n                    support its contention that the two marks were in fact visually\n                similar.32     The Appellant’s reliance onMedionshould be read in context in order to fully\n                    appreciate the reasoning behind the decision of the ECJ. The ECJ envisaged that\n                    notwithstanding that the overall impression of the average consumer may be\n                    dominated by one or more components of a composite mark, there might be\n                    instances whereby anon-dominant elementof a\n                    composite mark would nevertheless be so distinctive (viz, by virtue of its widely-known commercial name) such that\n                    the public may be led to believe that the goods or services at issue were\n                    derived from economically linked companies, in which case the “likelihood\n                    of confusion” must be held to be established, see [31] and [32] ofMedion.33     As seen above, the driving force behind the\n                    ECJ’s reasoning that there existed a “likelihood of\n                    confusion” between the two marks was because thenon-dominant but distinctive elementof the composite mark was\n                    one that wasin itselfalready widely-known, see\n                    [34] ofMedion. Thus, it is pertinent to note thatMediondoes not purport to confer upon\n                    otherwise dissimilar marks a greater degree of visual similarity by virtue of\n                    some distinctiveness in the earlier mark.34     Thus, even if one considers the word\n                    “FESTINA” to be non-dominant but distinctive, it is not sufficient\n                    in and by itself to establish that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are thereby visually similar. I therefore accept that\n                    there is no visual similarity between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.(2)   Conceptual Similarity35     The PAR at [63] of the GD noted that the\n                    addition of crest-like designs (eg, that of the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1) had over time been considered to be a design element\n                    which lends a “high-class” look to a mark. However, she opined\n                    that the same could not be said of a crown device (eg, that of Respondent’s mark) since it continues to this\n                    day to connote and evoke the idea of royal patronage. Thus, it was held that the\n                    two marks were conceptually dissimilar.36     The Appellant submitted that the proper\n                    comparison between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark\n                    in the assessment of conceptual similarity should be that the two marks were of\n                    a combination of a “foreign sort of name” and a device which hints\n                    at royalty. On this premise, the Appellant submitted that there was conceptual\n                    similarity between the two marks. Alternatively, the Appellant submitted that\n                    the crest and crown devices were conceptually neutral.37     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark were\n                    conceptually dissimilar as the crest device and the crown device conveyed\n                    different ideas. For instance, a crown device would convey an impression of\n                    royalty whereas a crest device,eg, crest of\n                    Singapore, would not.38     Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press,\n                        3rdEd, 2009) (“Bently\n                        & Sherman”) noted at p 866 that in relation to\n                    “conceptual similarity”:Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of theideas that lie behind or inform\n                            the earlier mark. [emphasis added]39     A clear case of conceptual dissimilarity can\n                    be seen inPhillips – Van Heusen, T–\n                    292/01 [2003] ECR II – 4335 where “BASS” was found\n                    to be conceptually dissimilar to “PASH” as the former was\n                    understood as a musical reference whereas the latter either had no meaning or\n                    referred to German dice.40Itochu Corporation v\n                        Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9\n                    (“Itochu”) offers a more nuanced illustration of conceptual\n                    similarity. InItochu, the PAR (and subsequently\n                    the High Court) held that the marks “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” were conceptually dissimilar: the\n                    “CAMEL” mark evoked a sense of “ruggedness, adventure and\n                    masculinity” whereas the applicant’s mark\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” which was preceded by the adjective\n                    “SWEET” projected a totally opposite impression.41     In the case ofOzone\n                        Community Corp, the two marks in issue were\n                    “GLAMOUR” and “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”. The PAR found that\n                    both marks were in some way conceptually similar as both marks used the\n                    “glamour” concept, despite one appealing to the orthodox meaning\n                    while the other giving the concept a spin without completely altering its\n                    texture. This finding was upheld by the High Court at [64].42     In the case ofImperial\n                        Tobacco Co (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd’s Trade Marks[1915] 2 Ch 27 (“Imperial Tobacco”), albeit decided in the context\n                    of whether the use of Prince of Wales plumes (part of the Prince of Wales\n                    heraldic achievements) which formed part of the proprietor’s trade mark\n                    amounted to an act of “calculative deception”, Lord Cozens- Hardy\n                    MR noted that the Prince of Wales feathers had for many years to a very great\n                    extent been used by traders of every kind in such a way that the mere use of\n                    them did not by itself indicate to anybody with a rational mind that the person\n                    so using it was a warrant holder. Concurring with Lord Cozens-Hardy MR, Pickford\n                    LJ further observed that:I have no doubt whatever that many kinds of articles are at the present\n                        moment described by the names of persons distinguished in the war, butno one imagines that that practice means anything\n                            more than giving those articles an attractive name, and I\n                        cannot imagine there is anything more than that in using the name of the\n                        Prince of Wales.[emphasis added]Notably, this passage buttresses the PAR’s finding at [63] of\n                    the GD that the use of a crest, in the modern context, is used to lend a\n                    “high-class” look to a mark design as an attraction to the average\n                    consumer as opposed to signifying royal patronage.43     The PAR further opined that the crown device\n                    connotes and evokes the idea of royal patronage. It is probable that the crown\n                    device would evoke a sense of royalty, which is in line with the\n                    Respondent’s brand story of an Italian princess who later became a\n                    Bulgarian queen. However, a crown device in modern usage does not signify only\n                    royal patronage. Borrowing the example of Eve J inImperial Tobacco, I do not think that an average consumer would\n                    be disappointed in finding out that the smoking mixture she purchased was not\n                    supplied for the personal use of the Prince of Wales. In the same vein, nor\n                    would the consumer be disappointed if she discovers that the watch she purchased\n                    was not used by an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. The crown device, in\n                    the modern day, is more likely to evoke a sense of royalty or class and status\n                    rather than royal patronage.44     The PAR at [63] of the GD appeared to have\n                    emphasized solely on the conceptual (dis)similarity between the crown and crest\n                    devices as the invented words were conceptually neutral. I accept the\n                    Appellant’s submission that as the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are composite marks, they should be viewed as a whole.\n                    Thus, the pictorial element as well as the word element should be taken into\n                    account while assessing the conceptual similarities between the marks. The\n                    Appellant’s alternative submission that the crown and crest concepts are\n                    neutral has to be rejected as both do evokesomequalities.45     In my view, insofar as the two marks comprise\n                    an invented word, in that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA”\n                    are not English terms found in dictionaries, and that both employ a pictorial\n                    element that hints at “class” and “status”, there\n                    aresomeconceptual similarities between the two\n                    marks, as opposed to complete or significant similarities, bearing in mind that\n                    the crest and crown devices evoke a sense of class but only the crown device\n                    evokes a sense of royalty.(3)   Aural Similarity46     The PAR at [61] of the GD found that there\n                    were aural similarities between the Appellant’s mark\n                    “FESTINA” and the Respondent’s mark “J.ESTINA”\n                    given that there is little difference between the sounds which the letters\n                    “F” and “J” make at the beginning of the words such\n                    that the pronunciation would largely focus on “ESTINA”. The PAR\n                    also found that while the Respondent’s mark was in the form of\n                    “J.ESTINA”, it was likely that the average consumer would\n                    pronounce it as “jes-tina”.47     At the PAR hearing below and on appeal, the\n                    Respondent sought to differentiate between “FESTINA” (pronounced\n                    as “fes-tina”) and “J.ESTINA” (pronounced as\n                    “jay-estina”) because the former comprises three syllables as\n                    opposed to the latter’s four syllables. The Respondent also submitted that\n                    Sargant LJ’s observation inLondon Lubricants (1920)\n                        Limited’s Application to Register a Trade Mark[1925]\n                    42 RPC 264 at 279 was instructive:[That] the tendency of persons using the English language to slur the\n                        termination of words also has the effect necessarily that the beginning of\n                        words is accentuated in comparison, and… the first syllable of a word\n                        is, as a rule, far [sic] the most important\n                        for the purpose of distinction.This observation, useful as it is, should not be taken as a hard and\n                    fast rule of pronunciation in the English language. The Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] rightly held that\n                    there is no rigid principle that the first syllable of a word mark is more\n                    important than other syllables.48     InMystery Drinks Gmbh v\n                        OHIM, T 99/01 [2004] ETMR (18) 217 (“Mystery\n                    Drinks”), the applicant argued that the two words “MIXERY”\n                    and “MYSTERY” were aurally different as the “i” in\n                    “MIXERY” was shorter and clearer than the “y” in\n                    “MYSTERY” and the “x” in “MIXERY” was\n                    pronounced differently from the “st” of “MYSTERY”.\n                    The European Court of First Instance (“CFI”) rejected this\n                    argument as such aural differences (as submitted by the applicant) could only be\n                    detected if one carried out a fragmented analysis, syllable by syllable, and\n                    completely omitted the comparison of the pronunciation of the words as a whole.\n                    In a similar fashion, the Respondent’s distinction of the number of\n                    syllables of the “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by\n                    dissecting the respective words and then analysing them at a micro-level\n                    overlooks the bigger picture that words are pronounced as a whole.49     In any event, it is more likely than not that\n                    the average consumer when pronouncing the words “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA” (whether pronounced as “Jes-ti-na” or\n                    “Jay-es-ti-na”) would stress “-estina”. The\n                    beginning letters of the words,ie,\n                    “F” and “J”, are consonants which would probably be\n                    given less emphasis. Thus, I agree with the PAR’s finding that there are\n                    aural similarities between “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.(4)   Overall similarity between the two marks50     As seen above, the Appellant’s mark 1\n                    and the Respondent’s mark are visually dissimilar but conceptually and\n                    aurally similar.51     The law does not require all three\n                    similarities to be established before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia\n                        Networks plc[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496 (“Mediacorp”) at [32]). As noted inBently & Shermanat pp 863-864:Typically, tribunals consider [visual, aural and conceptual similarities]\n                        in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they have\n                        observed that atrade-offcan occur: visual\n                        and conceptual differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities.[emphasis added]52     Hence, the relative importance of each type of\n                    similarity would vary with the circumstances of each case, in particular the\n                    type of goods and the type of mark. The case ofMystery\n                        Drinksserves as a useful illustration on this point. There, the\n                    CFI at [225] held that:Since the goods in question are also consumedafter\n                            being ordered orally, theaural similarity\n                            of the signs in question is in itself sufficient to give rise to\n                            likelihood of confusion. [emphasis added]53     There is much wisdom in the\n                    “trade-off” approach as it accords a degree of flexibility and\n                    latitude to the courts in coming to a conclusion (with regard to the overall\n                    similarity of marks) against a contextual background by adapting to the ever\n                    evolving commercial reality. For instance, it recognises that in this modern\n                    age, one is able to purchase a timepiece over the Internet, as opposed to the\n                    more conventional trade channels such as departmental stores or specialised\n                    boutiques. It is not denied that an average consumer would rely on his own\n                    visual recognition of a trade mark to differentiate among the various brands for\n                    timepieces. However, this visual recognition is often accompanied by the\n                    “verbalisation” of the mark,iethe\n                    name of the mark. The significance of the verbalisation will, in turn, depend on\n                    the particular mode of purchase of the consumer.54Shaker de L. Laudato &\n                        C. Sas v Limiñana y Botella, SL, Case C-334/05P\n                        (“Shaker”) highlights the\n                    significance of “verbalization” of a mark. InShaker, the applicant sought to register a composite mark for\n                    alcoholic beverages which included the word “LIMONCELLO” above an\n                    image of a plate decorated with six lemons. This was opposed by the owner of a\n                    Spanish word mark “LIMONCHELO” with respect to goods in\n                    Class 33. The CFI held that the signs were dissimilar because of the\n                    dominance of the dish feature in the applicant’s mark which was absent in\n                    the opponent’s mark. The authors ofBently &\n                        Shermancommented at p 864 that “this finding was itself\n                    surprising,given the general tendency to emphasize verbal\n                        components”. The ECJ overturned the CFI’s finding\n                    and reiterated that the assessment was a global one and should not be conducted\n                    by comparing only one element.(A)   Applying the significance of verbalizing a mark to the\n                context of purchase of a watch55     By way of an example, if a consumer chooses to\n                    purchase a “FESTINA” timepiece online, he could either buy it from\n                    a “FESTINA”e-store (assuming there is one) or from a website\n                    which hosts a variety of brands. In the former situation, the name or word\n                    element “FESTINA” has to be typed into the address bar or search\n                    engine for the consumer to be brought to the desired website. In the latter\n                    situation, the name or word element “FESTINA” will be found in a\n                    list of brand names on the relevant website. In both instances, one needs to\n                    recall the word element, “FESTINA”, as opposed to the crest\n                    element of the trade mark. Hence, the visual impact of the mark,ie, the crest, will be less significant as compared to\n                    the aural and visual impact of the word “FESTINA” despite the\n                    crest element being the dominant component of the mark.56     In a situation where a consumer chooses to buy\n                    a “FESTINA” timepiece from a shop, the visual recognition of the\n                    crest device in the trade mark may be of greater significance. Nevertheless,\n                    there is still a need to verbalize the word “FESTINA”. An average\n                    consumer usually identifies a trade mark by virtue of its pictorial element (if\n                    any)andits name/ word element. Even where the\n                    pictorial device forms the dominant element of a trade mark, it would be\n                    extremely rare for a consumer to describe the product by its pictorial element\n                    because the description of, say, the crest, is a much more difficult task, given\n                    its intricacy, as compared to the relatively easy articulation of the word\n                    element/ brand name. Thus, the aural similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    mark 1 and the Respondent mark would militate against the visual dissimilarity\n                    in this instance.(B)   Distinctiveness in the earlier mark57     The issue of distinctiveness of the earlier\n                    mark “FESTINA and device” was not discussed in the GD in the\n                    assessment of similarity of marks. Likewise, parties on appeal did not submit on\n                    the point of distinctiveness. Woo J has observed inOzone Community Corpat [67] that the distinctiveness of the\n                    earlier mark, either inherent or acquired, is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.58     Registrationper\n                        seis inconclusive as to the distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                        (The Polo/Lauren Coat [72]). Chao Hick Tin JA\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] also said:We recognise that some marks areinherently\n                            distinctivebecause they consist ofinventive words without any notional or allusive quality. An\n                        example would be \"Volvo\".[emphasis added]Given that “FESTINA” is an invented word, it possesses\n                    inherent distinctiveness and such distinctive quality would be taken into\n                    account in the overall assessment of similarity between the marks.59Bently &\n                        Shermanoffers some useful observation on the interplay between\n                    the distinctiveness of an earlier mark and the similarity of marks at pp 866-867\n                    (footnotes omitted):Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effects.First, the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the less literal or\n                        visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later mark is not similar.\n                        … InReed Executive plc v Reed Business\n                            Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ\n                        stated that ‘where a mark is descriptive [as opposed to distinctive]\n                        small differences may suffice to avoid confusion’… Where the\n                        distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will\n                        have to be in close proximity for it to be similar. …Second,if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then\n                            a mark that has been substantially modified might nonetheless be\n                            similar. …[emphasis added]60     As “FESTINA” is an invented word\n                    with inherent distinctiveness, a modification ofat\n                        leasta substantial degree has to be done for the\n                    Respondent’s mark to be found to be dissimilar to it. A comparison of the\n                    two composite marks shows that:(a)A crown device can be seen in both\n                        marks;(b)The Appellant’s crest device is not present\n                            in the Respondent’s mark;(c)Six out of seven letters in the Appellant’s\n                            word element of its composite mark,ie,\n                            “ESTINA”, are found in the Respondent’s\n                        mark;(d)The first letter “F” in the\n                            Appellant’s word element in its composite mark is replaced by a\n                            “J” and “.” in the Respondent’s\n                            mark.The word element of the Respondent’s mark\n                    “J.ESTINA” does not seem to be very dissimilar from the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”. It is likely that the imperfect\n                    recollection of a consumer who rarely has the opportunity to juxtapose the two\n                    marks and make a comparison may think the marks are similar, seeLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case\n                    C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343, 1358-1359.61     Given that there is significant aural\n                    similarity between “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” and\n                    taking into account the inherent distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                    “FESTINA”, I conclude that there is similarity between the two\n                    marks within the meaning of s 8(2)(b)\n                    TMA.Condition 2: Similarity of goods62     As noted inBently &\n                        Shermanat p 869, “the question of whether goods or\n                    services are similar depends on the facts of the case”. The goods which\n                    the Respondent’s application relates to are “wrist watches,\n                    electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches”. On the other hand, the goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 (ie, Class 14\n                    goods) was registered include “watches, clocks and other chronometric\n                    instruments”.63     The PAR found that there was identity between\n                    “wrist watches, electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and\n                    “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, see [71] of\n                    GD. As for the remaining goods of the Respondent’s application,ie, “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings,\n                    medals and brooches”, the PAR found that there was some similarity\n                    between them and the Appellant’s Class 14 goods as watches and\n                    jewellery have similar use as being articles of adornment although watches have\n                    the additional function of being able to tell the time, see [73] of GD. I agree\n                    with these findings made by the PAR.64     The PAR held at [53] of the GD that the goods\n                    in Classes 9, 18 and 25 (ie, goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s other marks were registered) were not identical or similar\n                    to the goods of the Respondent’s mark. On appeal, the Appellant argued\n                    that the PAR erred in this respect. For ease of reference, the goods in\n                    Classes 9, 18 and 25 are as below:Classes of goods which the Appellant’s other\n                                        marks were registered forSpecification of goods in the Respondent’s\n                                        applicationClass\n                                                9SpectaclesClass\n                                                14Wrist watches, electric\n                                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings,\n                                            bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                                    brooches.Class\n                                                18Leather and imitation\n                                            leather; goods made of these materials and not included\n                                            in other classes; animal skins and hides; trunks and\n                                            suitcases; umbrellas; parasols and walking sticks;\n                                            whips, harness and saddleryClass\n                                                25Clothing and\n                                        footwear65     The Respondent submitted that the goods\n                    falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were evidently dissimilar from those of\n                    Class 14 as there was no overlap of goods. The Respondent objected to the\n                    Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and\n                    25 as “fashion accessories” as this would entail an expansion of\n                    the categories to include goods which otherwise would not be so classified. Such\n                    an unwarranted expansion was said to have the effect of defeating the whole\n                    purpose of having a system of classification. However, this submission may not\n                    be entirely correct. The fact that goods are classified into various classes\n                    under the ICGS does not preclude a finding that those goods are nevertheless\n                    similar in nature. This is because goods are so classified for administrative\n                    convenience whereas the question of whether goods are similar is an issue of\n                    substantive law, seeEl Corte Ingles SA v OHIM,\n                    Case T-443/05 [2007] ETMR (81) 1340 (“El\n                        Corte Ingles”) at [38].66     The Appellant, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the relevant goods were “fashion accessories” and citedBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons\n                        Ltd[1996] RPC 281 (“British\n                        Sugar”) which was endorsed byOzone\n                        Community Corpat [75] as the proper test to be used in\n                    determining whether the goods were similar. The factors that were to be taken\n                    into account were (British Sugarat\n                    296-297):(a)The respective uses of the respective\n                            goods;(b)The respective end users of the respective\n                            goods;(c)The physical nature of the goods;(d)The respective trade channels through which the\n                            goods reach the market;(e)In the case of self-serve consumer items, whether\n                            in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found on the\n                            same or different shelves; and(f)Whether the respective goods are competitive or\n                            complementary. This inquiry may take into account how those in the trade\n                            classify goods, for instance whether market research companies who act\n                            for the industry put the goods or services in the same or different\n                            sectors.67     The Appellant further submitted thatQS by S. Oliver Trade Mark[1999] RPC 520\n                        (“QS”) was a constructive\n                    indicator of “similarity of goods”. InQS, it was held that leather goods, leather bags, purses,etcwould be regarded as “clothing\n                    accessories”. This was because these items were found to be complementary\n                    to clothing, had the same users and trade channels, and both would be found\n                    adjacent to each other in retail outlets.68     Building on this line of reasoning, the\n                    Appellant submitted that goods falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were\n                    frequently designed and manufactured by a single entity as they were all\n                    considered as fashion accessories and were complementary to the consumer’s\n                    style or get up. The Appellant pointed to various stores in Singapore such as\n                    “Calvin Klein” and “DKNY” where a diverse range of\n                    clothing and accessories, such as clothing, bags, shoes, jewellery and watches,\n                    could be found in the same store as they were intended to be put together as a\n                    particular look or style.69     Furthermore, there is now a trend among\n                    fashion designers to either license out their name or engage in brand extension.\n                    For instance, a brand that was previously well-known for handbags may now be\n                    selling sunglasses, clothes or even phones with its trade mark affixed on such\n                    goods. Thus, it was the Appellant’s submission that a consumer would\n                    expect that goods falling within one of the “fashion-related\n                    classes”,eg, Class14 (watches) and\n                    Class 25 (clothing and footwear), to have originated from the same source\n                    or from economically-linked undertakings.70     This idea of “aesthetic harmony”\n                    or “aesthetic complementarity” was discussed inBently & Shermanwhere two conflicting lines of cases\n                    decided by differently constituted CFI were given some consideration. In the\n                    case ofSergio Rossi SpA v OHIM, Sissi Rossi, Case\n                    T-169/03 [2005] ECR II-685, the CFI held that women’s bags and\n                    women’s footwear were not “aesthetically complementary” as\n                    the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this aesthetic complementary nature\n                    had reached a stage of “true aesthetic necessity” in the sense\n                    that the consumers would think it unusual or shocking to carry a bag which does\n                    not perfectly match their shoes. Subsequently, a CFI of five judges held that\n                    bags and clothes were sufficiently complementary to be regarded as similar, seeEl-Corte Inglesat [38]. In the absence of an\n                    ECJ decision, the authors ofBently & Shermanat p 871 opined that the second view, which was more open to the idea that\n                    consumers might draw connections between goods because they are searching for\n                    “aesthetic harmony”, to be more consistent with the general idea\n                    of a fact-sensitive “global appreciation” by the\n                Court.71     As the Appellant rightly observed, there is a\n                    growing phenomenon of brands expanding into goods of various kinds in recent\n                    years. Sometimes, the crossing-over takes place between goods that one does not\n                    commonly associate with each other, for instance, cigarettes and clothing. The\n                    idea of licensing out one’s trade mark or engaging in a sister brand or\n                    diffusion line has inevitably led to the same trade mark being found on a\n                    multitude of goods available in the market. In this regard, there is force in\n                    the Appellant’s submissions that there is a sense of\n                    “relatedness” between goods such as necklaces and clothing and a\n                    broad classification of these items as “fashion accessories” or\n                    “lifestyle goods” may be justified.72     Applying theBritish\n                        Sugartest to the present facts, it would be reasonable in the\n                    modern context to regard the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 (trunks and\n                    suitcases and, in some instances, even umbrellas and parasols) and 25 as\n                    complementary in nature and are likely to be of similar uses, targeting almost\n                    identical end users and employing similar if not identical trade channels by\n                    which the goods reach the market. Thus, there issomesimilarity between “necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches” in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the goods for which the Appellant’s other marks are registered in\n                    Classes 9, 18 (the items specified above) and 25.73     However, the Appellant’s inclusion of\n                    the other goods in Class 18, such as walking sticks, whips, harness and\n                    saddlery, as “fashion accessories” would appear to be too\n                    over-reaching. To say that these items are “fashion accessories”\n                    which aresimilar to“necklaces, rings,\n                    bracelets, earrings, medal and brooches” would be to put an unnatural\n                    strain on the average consumer’s perception of what fashion accessories\n                    are. Thus, these items are not similar to the Class 14 goods in the\n                    Respondent’s application.74     The implication of the above finding that\n                    there is similarity between the goods in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the Appellant’s registered goods in Classes 9, 18 and 25 is that the\n                    Appellant’s other marks can be considered against the Respondent’s\n                    mark in determining whether there is a similarity of marks. For this purpose,\n                    the two competing marks are:Respondent’s markAppellant’s other marksTaking into account the Appellant’s other marks in the\n                    assessment lends even more force to the finding that there is similarity of\n                    marks as there is much greater visual similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.75     To summarize the findings thus far:(a)There is identity between the goods in the\n                            Respondent’s application for “wrist watches, electric\n                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and the Appellant’s\n                            goods in Class 14 for “watches, clocks and other\n                            chronometric instruments”;(b)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s Class 14\n                            goods;(c)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s goods in\n                            Classes 9, 18 (trunks and suitcases and, in some instances, even\n                            umbrellas and parasols) and 25.Indeed, with today’s creative proliferation of goods morphing and\n                    merging in functionalities and forms, one begins to wonder whether the\n                    classification of goods for trade mark purposes is becoming dated and whether it\n                    reflects present-day commerce.Condition 3: Likelihood of Confusion76     Having found that there is similarity of marks\n                    and identity in some goods and some similarity in others, we now turn to the\n                    assessment of whether there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                    public. As stated earlier, there is no presumption of confusion even where\n                    similarity of marks and goods are made out, seeOzone\n                        Community Corpat [81] and the Court of Appeal’s decision\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [8].77     Lee Seiu Kin J at [43] ofMediacorpdealt with the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion”:The following principles as to what constitutes \"likelihood of confusion\"\n                        can be distilled from the cases:(a)   The court is entitled to look outside the mark and\n                        the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                        likelihood of confusion (Polo/Lauren([29]supra) at [8]).(b)   The question of likelihood of confusion has to be\n                        looked at globally taking into account all the circumstances including\n                            (Polo/Laurenat [28]):(i)    the closeness of the goods;(ii)   the impression given by the marks;(iii)  the possibility of imperfect recollection;(iv)  the risk that the public might believe that the goods come\n                        from the same source or economically-linked sources;(v)   the steps taken by the defendant to differentiate the\n                        goods from those of the registered proprietor; and(vi)  the kind of customer who would be likely to buy the goods\n                        of the applicant and opponent.(c)   One should not determine the likelihood of confusion\n                        based on the man in a hurry, and the test should be the \"ordinary, sensible\n                        members of the public\" (Polo/Laurenat [31]).\n                        The average consumer is someone who would exercise some care and good sense\n                        in making his purchases (Polo/Laurenat [34]).\n                        However, the \"average consumer\" need not necessarily mean the general\n                        public, as more specialised products might be purchased by a more specific\n                        cross-section of the public (Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd\n                            v Oystertec plc[2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 at\n                        [97]).(d)   The ambit of the protection offered by\n                        the Act to a registered proprietor of a trade mark should be guided by the\n                        underlying aim of the trade marks regime, which is to ensure that consumers\n                        do not confuse the trade source of one product with another (Polo/Laurenat [32]). The policy of s 8 of the\n                        Act is to protect the public against deception. InWeir\n                            Warman Ltd v Research & Development Pty Ltd[2007]\n                        2 SLR(R) 1073 , V K Rajah JA observed that (at [41]):It is plain that the trade mark register is intended to be a\n                            comprehensive and accurate record of trade marks currently in use. As\n                            such, it is crucial to maintain the accuracy of the register and to\n                            ensure that undeserving and invalid trade marks are removed from the\n                            register without undue delay and complication.In\n                                addition, the register is meant to assure and endorse the function\n                                of registered trade marks as badges of origin ... so as to protect\n                                the public against deception. Hence marks that are misleading or\n                                likely to cause confusion or no longer serve their function should\n                                not be accepted or allowed to remain on the register, as the case\n                                may be. [emphasis added]To this end, mere association which the public may make between two trade\n                        marks because of their semantic content is not in itself a sufficient basis\n                        for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion, in the absence of\n                        any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods and\n                        services (Richemont International SA v Da Vinci\n                            Collections Pte Ltd(\"Richemont\") [2006] 4 SLR(R) 369 at [20]).(e)   The greater the exposure and use of a particular\n                        registered mark, the greater its reputation is likely to be, and therefore\n                        the greater the protection likely to be afforded to it (The Polo/Lauren Coat [34]).78     In relation to (a) above,ie, where “a court is entitled to look outside the mark\n                    and the sign”, Woo J inOzone Community\n                        Corpat [84] to [87] conducted a thorough review of the\n                    conflicting line of cases which differed on whether a court is entitled to\n                    consider extraneous factors in determining whether there is a likelihood of\n                    confusion and concluded in the affirmative. In addition to that, the ECJ inCanon Kabushiki Kaisha v Pathé Communications[1998] ETMR 366 andLloyd Schuhfabrikcases noted that the global assessment of likelihood of confusion implies some\n                    interdependence between the relevant factors, and in particular, similarity of\n                    marks and of goods.79     As pointed out earlier, both the\n                    Appellant’s and the Respondent’s marks have not been used in\n                    Singapore. Thus, an analysis of the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion” has to be made on the basis of a notional, normal and fair use\n                    of the marks, seeReact and Device Trade Mark[1999] RPC 529, 532.80     It is fair to say that the average consumer in\n                    Singapore is one who is literate, educated, exposed to the world and unlikely to\n                    be easily hoodwinked, seeMcDonald’s Corp v Future\n                        Enterprises Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177 at\n                [64].81     Having considered the various factors, the PAR\n                    held (at [84] of the GD) that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part\n                    of the public as:(a)The goods in question,ie, watches and fashion accessories, had some areas of\n                            overlap but were not substitutes and were normally bought after much\n                            scrutiny and not at a whim, at [76] of GD;(b)An average price of $400.00 was assigned to the\n                            Appellant’s and Respondent’s watches respectively. The PAR\n                            opined that at such a price, the consumers were not likely to be\n                            careless with their purchase, at [77] of GD;(c)Consumers of fashion accessories would be a\n                            “conscious lot” who would exercise “some form of\n                            brand loyalty” thus taking pains to ensure that the purchased\n                            goods were of a particular brand, at [78] of GD;(d)Against the backdrop of a proliferation of\n                            different brands and products, consumers would be more deliberate and\n                            circumspect in their selection and purchase, at [79] of\n                        GD;(e)The mode of sales via specialist boutiques and\n                            departmental stores would mean that the visual appearances of the marks\n                            would be the main differentiating factor, at [80] of GD;(f)The Respondent had taken steps to differentiate\n                            their goods,viz, jewellery and watches,\n                            from the Appellant’s by way of development of a brand story which\n                            portrays a romantic, fairytale-like image of an Italian princess and\n                            Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet cat.\n                            In contrast, the Appellant’s goods tend to portray a more mature\n                            and sensual image, at [81] to [83] of GD.82     The average consumer is exposed to a variety\n                    of brands. There is also an increasing trend of brands venturing into diffusion\n                    lines so as to target different sectors of consumers. For instance, a brand that\n                    used to be associated only with female users may now branch into products for\n                    male users as well. Similarly, a brand known for its upmarket products may want\n                    to make inroads into a more affordable product range. Consumers generally regard\n                    the main and diffusion lines to be of the same source.Bently\n                        & Shermanat p 872 discusses what “likelihood of\n                    confusion” under the UK equivalent of s 8(2)(b) TMA connotes (footnotes omitted):In its ‘classic’ form, consumers must be confused about the\n                        source or origin of the goods or services – that is, they must be\n                        confused as to the designer, manufacturer, selector or supplier of the goods\n                        or services. In other words, classic confusion is concerned with the\n                        situation where consumers believe that the goods or services emanate from\n                        one organization, but they, in fact come from a different independent\n                        organization. This classic form of confusion has been extended to\n                        accommodate broader understandings of the source of goods or services.\n                        Consequently, a person will be confused for the purposes of [UK equivalent\n                        of s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                        assume that there is some broader kind ofeconomic\n                            connectionbetween the users of marks, for example, that the\n                        goods are being provided by a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark\n                        owner. …In considering whether there is a likelihood of confusion, the tribunals\n                        must consider whether there is a genuine and properly substantiated\n                        likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that confusion is hypothetical and\n                        remote. The term ‘likelihood’ indicates probability rather than\n                        possibility. …[italics in original]83     Similar toCity Chain\n                        Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2010]\n                    1 SLR 382 (“City Chain\n                    Stores”), the Appellant’s goods in Class 14 include\n                    watches. The Court of Appeal inCity Chain Storesat [56] held that since a watch is a product which is commonly available and\n                    purchased by the general public, the average consumer would be the general\n                    public. Thus, it follows that the nature of the members of public is a relevant\n                    consideration. The Court of Appeal went on to say as follows:The average consumer is not an unthinking person in a hurry but someone\n                        who would exercise some care and good sense in making his purchases\n                        …Thus, it was held when luxury goods are purchased, they are bought\n                    after careful inspection and deliberation.(1)   Is there a possibility that the consumers would be confused\n                that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” are from the same or\n                economically-linked undertakings?84     In considering this question, the function of\n                    the respective marks as badges of origin of the goods becomes especially\n                    important. The marks “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” both\n                    end with “-ESTINA” which is part of an invented word with no\n                    meaning in itself. Apart from their similarity discussed earlier, one must also\n                    consider the possibility that the consumer would see the letters\n                    “ESTINA” as a common suffix and therefore associate goods with the\n                    same (invented) suffix “ESTINA” to be from economically-linked\n                    sources.85     In the case ofDurferrit\n                        GmbH v OHIM, T-244/01 [2003] ECR II-1589,\n                    “NUTRIDE” and “TUFFTRIDE” were held by the CFI to be\n                    dissimilar despite sharing the same suffix “-TRIDE. However, there are\n                    counter examples such asJulian James’ Application:\n                        Opposition of Smart GmbH[2005] ETMR (93) 1096 where\n                    “CARSMART” was held to be similar to “SMART” (albeit\n                    in part due to “CAR” being descriptive). Notably, these\n                    counter-examples serve to illustrate that rulings are\n                    “fact-specific” and asBently &\n                        Shermannotes at p 866, such examples have virtually no value as\n                    precedents.86     It was held inCity Chain\n                        Storesat [58] (approving the approach inRichemont International SA v Goldlion Enterprise (Singapore) Pte\n                        Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 401 at [20]) that in the absence of\n                    any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods or services,\n                    the mere association of the public between Solvil’s “Solvil\n                    Flower” and Louis Vuitton’s “Flower Quatrefoil mark”\n                    based on their similar use was not a sufficient basis for concluding that there\n                    is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the members of public.87     Notably, unlikeCity Chain\n                        Storeswhere there was a stark disparity in price between the\n                    parties’ watches,ie, $200 and (at least)\n                    $4,000 respectively, there is no such disparity between the Appellant’s\n                    and Respondent’s watches, both of which are marked at around $400. It is\n                    important to recognise that “a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk\n                    will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of\n                    £50,000” (as per Pumfrey J inPicasso v\n                        OHIM, T-104/01 [2002] ECR II-4359). It may be argued\n                    that it is unlikely that the average consumer would freely and whimsically spend\n                    $400 on a watch without much consideration prior to the purchase and that\n                    although the average consumer might do a “double-take” when\n                    looking at “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by virtue of\n                    similarity of marks, at a price of $400, the consumer will exercise some degree\n                    of prudence and pause for a moment to ensure that he is purchasing a watch from\n                    the desired brand.88     Even if there is an association between the\n                    two marks owing to the common “-ESTINA”, this association by\n                    itself, short of a misapprehension of origin of the goods, may not warrant a\n                    finding of likelihood of confusion. Some evidence would need to be adduced to\n                    indicate such an association on account of the advertisements, methods of sale\n                    and/or packaging of the Appellant’s and Respondent’s items or for\n                    any other reason. Otherwise, the risk of confusion is merely hypothetical and\n                    speculative because there is simply no evidence of any such confusion arising on\n                    the part of the consumers; seeCity Chain Storesat [57].89     In this regard, the steps taken by the\n                    Respondent to differentiate its goods from those of the Appellant’s become\n                    pertinent. As Lai Kew Chai J inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v\n                        Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005] 4 SLR(R) 816 at\n                    [21] opined, where the user of a potentially infringing sign had taken pains to\n                    distinguish his products from the registered proprietor’s goods, the\n                    effect might be that the likelihood of confusion, if any, was merely\n                    hypothetical or speculative. The Respondent here submitted that it had taken\n                    steps in differentiating its goods from the Appellant’s given that its\n                    target consumer was wholly different from the Appellant’s. The Respondent\n                    referred to its brand story which projected a dainty image of an Italian\n                    princess and Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet\n                    cat. Accordingly, it was argued that this brand story was likely to draw the\n                    attention and patronage of younger female consumers. In stark contrast, the\n                    Appellant’s goods were advertised in more mature materials thus conveying\n                    an image of maturity and sensuality aimed at older and more established female\n                    consumers.90     Unlike the situation inCity Chain Storeswhere Solvil watches averaging $200 in price\n                    were pitted against Louis Vuitton watches costing at least thousands of dollars,\n                    we have here goods of similar pricing which may be described as low to\n                    medium-range, bearing in mind the standard of living in Singapore. There was no\n                    evidence that the Appellant’s or the Respondent’s watches were sold\n                    in specialty stores (unlike those of Louis Vuitton). We are comparing marks\n                    which bear words and pictures resembling each other and not merely four-petal\n                    stylised flower designs (Louis Vuitton’s flower design inCity Chain Storeswas considered not to be that\n                    well-known standing on its own anyway). We also do not know how the parties will\n                    market or advertise their goods in Singapore as both do not have a presence here\n                    at the moment. With the similarity in the marks and in the goods as discussed\n                    earlier, there is a real likelihood that the consumer may mistake one brand for\n                    the other or believe erroneously that the two are related and have the same\n                    origin or come from economically-linked sources.91     The Respondent’s brand story does not\n                    serve as a differentiating measure as there is no brand story on the\n                    Appellant’s part. In any event, merely having the brand story on its\n                    website is far removed from having it in routine advertisements. Indeed, by\n                    giving a European setting to its brand name, the Respondent (with its origin in\n                    the Far East) increases the likelihood of confusion between FESTINA and\n                    J.ESTINA. I will have more to comment on the brand story later when I deal with\n                    the issue of bad faith.92     In all the circumstances of the case, I am of\n                    the view that the likelihood of confusion is a probability and not a mere\n                    possibility. With respect, the PAR’s opinion on this issue was premised on\n                    her findings from which I have departed materially. Accordingly, the Appellant\n                    is entitled to succeed in its opposition based on s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA.Appeal against PAR’s decision under s 7(6) TMA93     s 7(6) TMA stipulates as follows:Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration7. —(1) …(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith.94     The PAR held at [113] of the GD that the\n                    Respondent’s act of registering “J.ESTINA” was not\n                    sufficient to show that its act fell short of the standard of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade. Thus, the PAR opined that bad faith was not established.95     The Appellant submitted that given the\n                    Appellant’s establishment since 1902 and the successful sales it has in\n                    Hong Kong and Japan, the Respondent was very likely to have been aware of the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA and device”. The Appellant also\n                    took issue with the Respondent’s failure to tender any written submissions\n                    on the issue of bad faith. In particular, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent failed to provide evidence of any “Jovanna Estina” or\n                    even any “Estina family” with ties to royalty (in its brand\n                    story).96     The Appellant citedPolo\n                        Spirit Pte Ltd v S. Tous S.L[2009] SGIPOS 3 for the\n                    proposition that when bad faith is alleged by either party, the party who is\n                    second in time has the onus of explaining how he came about using or registering\n                    the mark. Moreover, the Appellant sought to rely onKundry\n                        SA’s Application: Opposition by the President and Fellows of Harvard\n                        College[1998] ETMR 178, for the proposition that where\n                    the applicant had not rebutted such serious claims of bad faith by way of\n                    counterstatement or evidence, the opposition would be allowed to\n                proceed.97     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that since the two marks were completely different, no issue of bad faith arose\n                    in the present case. In any event, the derivation of the Respondent’s mark\n                    was sufficiently explained in the brand story,ie,\n                    the initial “J” stands for “Jovanna” which is\n                    derived from the name of an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen known as\n                    “Jovanna Elizabeth Antonia Romana Marie” and revolves around\n                    princess Jovanna’s name, her tiara and her pet cat “Jenna”.\n                    The Respondent argued that it never maintained that the Respondent’s mark\n                    was indeed the princess’ name.98     An allegation that a trade mark has been\n                    applied for in bad faith is a serious one. In “Royal\n                        Enfield” Trade Marks[2002] RPC 24 at [31]\n                    (endorsed by the Court of Appeal inFuture\n                        Enterprisesat [78]) it was held that:A plea of fraud should not lightly be made ... and if made should be\n                        distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not permissible to leave\n                        fraud to be inferred from the facts (seeDavy v\n                            Garrett(1877-78) L.R. 7 Ch.D. 473 at 489). … It\n                        should not be made unless it can be fully and properly pleaded and should\n                        not be upheld unless it is distinctly proved and this will rarely be\n                        possible by a process of inference.Notably, this sets a high threshold for an allegation of bad faith to\n                    be met by the Appellant.99     The findings of Geoffrey Hobbs QC inDemon Ale Trade Mark[2000] RPC 345 with\n                    regard to the expression “bad faith” was cited with approval inNautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard and\n                        another[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 (“Nautical\n                    Concept”) at [19]:[There are] moral overtones which appear to make it possible for an\n                        application for registration to be rendered invalid ... by behaviour which\n                        otherwise involves no breach of any duty, obligation, prohibition or\n                        requirement that is legally binding upon the applicant.The logical consequence of this is such that once bad faith is\n                    established, the application to register a trade mark in question will not be\n                    allowed even if the mark does not cause any confusion or breach of\n                duty.What is “bad faith”?100    Bad faith is to be determined as at the date\n                    of application and matters which occurred after the date of application which\n                    may assist in determining the applicant’s state of mind as at the date of\n                    application can be taken into consideration, seeFerrero\n                        SpA’s Trade Marks (Kinder), O/279/03\n                    [2004] RPC (29) 253.101    Lindsay J inGromax\n                        Plasticulture Ltd v Don & Low Nonwovens Ltd[1999] RPC 367 at 379 discussed what the concept of “bad\n                    faith” connotes:I shall not attempt to define bad faith in this context. Plainly it\n                        includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which\n                        fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by\n                        reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined.\n                        Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not\n                        bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short as to amount\n                        to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by\n                        the courts (which leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the\n                        Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a\n                        regard to all material surrounding circumstances.102    AsBently &\n                        Shermanat p 851 observes, the courts have struggled to find a\n                    satisfactory definition of “bad faith” and have ultimately aligned\n                    the definition in trade mark law with that operating in other areas of civil\n                    liability, particularly the so-called “knowing assistance” in\n                    breach of trust, seeHarrison’s Trade Mark\n                        Application[2005] FSR 10\n                    (“Harrison’s”). InHarrison’s, Sir William Aldous discussed the notion of\n                    “bad faith” at [24] and [26]:Clearly the court, when considering bad faith, cannot apply a purely\n                        subjective test, called by Lord Hutton [inTwinsectra Ltd\n                            v Yardley[2002] 2 AC 164] the “Robin Hood\n                        test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards cannot be\n                        permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances where a person\n                        abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The registration of trade mark\n                        is designed to enablebona fideproprietors to\n                        protect their proprietary rights without having to prove unfair trading.\n                        Registration is not provided to help those with low moral standards.…For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord Hutton [in relation to\n                        “dishonesty”] as applying to considerations of bad faith. The\n                        words “bad faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when\n                        considering the question of whether an application to register is made in\n                        bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must\n                        decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to\n                        apply for registration would be regarded as bad faith by persons adopting\n                        proper standards.103    The authors ofBently\n                        & Shermanat p 852 note that instances of “bad\n                    faith” can be placed into three categories:(a)No intention to use the mark;(b)Abuse of a relationship;(c)Where the applicant was aware that a third party\n                            had some sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark.104    The following cases demonstrate the meaning\n                    of bad faith according to the above categorization:(a)   No intention to use the mark105    In the case ofPT\n                        Swakarya Indah Busana v Dhan International Exim Pte Ltd[2010]\n                    2 SLR 109, Lai Siu Chiu J found that after registering the mark\n                    “EMPEROR MARTIN” in 2002, the defendant did not intend to use the\n                    mark. Instead, on the shirts sold by the defendant was the defendant’s\n                    tailored mark (as opposed to the registered mark) which showed the word\n                    “MARTIN” in a much more prominent font than that of\n                    “Emperor”. Lai J found that there was an obvious and\n                    conscious effort on the part of the defendant to copy the plaintiff’s mark\n                    in the usage of the word “MARTIN”. The plaintiff had a total of\n                    six marks registered in Singapore, all of which included the name\n                    “MARTIN”) and there was a deliberate preference to use the\n                    defendant’s tailored mark instead of the defendant’s registered\n                    mark. Thus, the lack ofbona fideintention to use\n                    the mark in the form that was applied to be registered was found to be an act of\n                    bad faith.(b)   Abuse of a relationship106    InNautical\n                        Concept, Tan Lee Meng J found the appellant there to have\n                    acted in bad faith when it sought to register its “JWest” mark. It\n                    was held that in the light of the appellant’s history of dealings with the\n                    respondent and its blatant attempt to take advantage of the respondent’s\n                    trade mark,ie, “Jeffery West” and\n                    “JW” time and time again in the past, its attempt to register the\n                    “JWest” mark was regarded as an unacceptable business tactic\n                    adopted in relation to the respondent’s trade mark. The appellant’s\n                    attempt to explain the derivation of its mark was found to be too far-fetched;\n                    at [26] ofNautical Concept. Tan J agreed\n                    with the PAR’s decision there that the “sheer elaborateness of the\n                    explanations” for the selection of one letter of the mark (the letter\n                    “J”) made it difficult to believe the appellant’s reasons\n                    for choosing the mark “JWest”. This was especially so when there\n                    was a glaring omission on the appellant’s part to mention that its\n                    managing director once distributed shoes under the mark “Jeffery\n                    West” and “JW” for the respondent.107    A finding of bad faith can also be made\n                    where the applicant was aware that someone else intends to use and/or register\n                    the mark, particularly where the applicant has a relationship, for example as\n                    employee or agent, with that other person, or where the applicant has copied a\n                    mark being used abroad with the intention of pre-empting the proprietor who\n                    intends to trade in the specific country, seeDaawat Trade\n                        Mark[2003] RPC 11 at [93]. Similarly, where an\n                    applicant attempts, by means of registration, to seize a trade mark of a third\n                    party with whom he had a contractual or pre-contractual relationship, the\n                    registration would also be found to have been made in bad faith, seeLancome Parfums et Beaute & Cie’s Community Trade Mark\n                        Application[2001] ETMR 89 (“Lancome\n                    Parfums”) at [33].(c)   Where the applicant was aware that a third party had some\n                sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark108    InRothmans of Pall Mall\n                        Ltd v Maycolson International Pte Ltd[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 551 (“Rothmans”),\n                    having regard to the totality of evidence, Lai Siu Chiu J at [36] to [41]\n                    found that various instances of bad faith could be inferred in that case. For\n                    instance, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incorporation of the\n                    respondent company suggested that it was merely a “shell company”\n                    used by the Hertlein brothers to propagate the use of the\n                    “Fairlight” mark in relation to cigarettes. Moreover, despite a\n                    Europe-wide injunction which at that time prevented the Hertlein brothers from\n                    using the “Fairlight” mark and packaging, they have repeatedly\n                    shown their improper motives to capitalise on the appellant's reputation and\n                    goodwill by their attempt to sidestep the terms of the injunction, as well as by\n                    their persistence in associating themselves with the proprietor's trade marks.\n                    Such an association with the appellants can be seen from the Hertlein\n                    brothers’ lack of candour when explaining their advertising strategies\n                    which blatantly claimed that \"Fairlight\" cigarettes were similar in taste and\n                    packaging to the appellant’s \"Rothmans\" cigarettes or that\n                    “Fairlight” cigarettes resembled the appellant’s \"Rothmans\"\n                    cigarettes.109    Other illustrations of bad faith can be also\n                    be seen inInterkrenn Maschinen Vertriebs GmbH’s\n                        Community Trade Mark[2002] ETMR 27 whereby the\n                    applicant conclusively showed that there was a person who was linked to the\n                    trade mark proprietor and who had obtained knowledge of a planned trade mark of\n                    the applicant during a business meeting. This scenario was dubbed as a classic\n                    case of “trade mark theft”.110    During the course of submissions, parties\n                    were invited to address the court on whether “bad faith” was a\n                    stand-alone, distinct ground of opposition which was independent of attending\n                    confusion or whether a “twin-approach” should be taken (in the\n                    sense that bad faith can be relied upon in order to tilt the balance in deciding\n                    whether there was confusion between the two marks).111    The Appellant submitted that there has to beat leastsome similarity between the two marks\n                    before bad faith can be established, thus alluding to a case of\n                    “copying” of the proprietor’s mark. Alternatively, the\n                    Appellant reiterated Lai J’s decision inRothmansin which it was held at [29] thatdespite the fact that the marks in question are not so similar as to cause\n                        confusion, bad faith can still be established on the\n                    facts.112    As for the Respondent, it maintained that\n                    nothing short of a “distinct proof of unacceptable commercial\n                    behaviour” should warrant a finding of bad faith. This position, however,\n                    seems to be a rather abstract postulation of what the court should do in\n                    determining whether bad faith arose on the facts.113    From the case law discussed above, it\n                    appears that bad faith encompasses “underhand practice involving absence\n                    of good faith on the part of the [trade mark applicant]” (in the words ofLancome Parfumsat [33]. As bad faith is an\n                    “absolute ground for refusal”, this suggests that it is an\n                    independent and distinct ground for refusing the registration of marks in its\n                    own right. As noted by Lai J inRothmans,\n                    this view is consonant with Tan Tee Jim SC’s observations inLaw of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell Asia, 2ndEd, 2005) at paragraph\n                    5.71:Once bad faith is established, the application will be refused, even\n                        though the offending conduct does not cause any confusion or breach any\n                        duty, obligation, prohibition or other legally binding requirement.114    However, the numerous attempts in drawing\n                    the parameters of “bad faith” by various courts are vivid\n                    illustrations of the inherently abstract nature of this concept. The concept of\n                    bad faith is extremely wide in the sense that the courts can infer instances of\n                    bad faith and decide according to the justice of individual cases. Naturally,\n                    the court should also be cautious in not over-extending this concept lest it\n                    becomes a weapon of terror against competitors of trade mark\n                proprietors.115    The categorization byBently & Shermanas seen above hints that despite the broad\n                    nature of the notion of bad faith, one must showsome sort of\n                        nexusbetween the parties in dispute. Otherwise, the notion of\n                    bad faith would have to be decided in vacuum. A clear-cut example of such a\n                    nexus would be an outright copying of the proprietor’s mark such that the\n                    two competing marks are practically identical. However, the nexus may be in the\n                    guise of something more subtle. In finding a nexus between the parties, a\n                    parallel may be drawn between ss 8(2)(b) and\n                    s 7(6) TMA. For example, there may be cases where although there issomesimilarity of marks or of the goods or\n                    services, it falls short of confusing similarity (ie, no likelihood of confusion) within the meaning of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. Nevertheless, the evidence\n                    of this similarity may be taken into account and considered against the\n                    background facts from which bad faith may be inferred. In other words, while the\n                    finding of bad faith is largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial\n                    evidence, the party alleging bad faith needs to show some link between the\n                    parties, perhaps by way of a pre-existing relationship or some acts of\n                    association with the proprietor or some nexus between the two competing\n                    marks.116    There may be a fine line between being\n                    inspired by another’s trade mark as opposed to blatant copying or copying\n                    with some modifications made to the mark. The former would not attract punitive\n                    measures whereas the latter would lead to the mark being rejected. Where the\n                    dividing line between “inspiration” and\n                    “infringement” should be drawn is a matter best left to the facts\n                    peculiar to any case.Was the Respondent’s registration of “J.ESTINA”\n                made in bad faith?117    The Appellant argued that the lack of\n                    response from the Respondent against the claim of bad faith was far from\n                    satisfactory. Even if the Respondent’s brand story was taken as some sort\n                    of explanation of the derivation of the brand name, it was argued that the brand\n                    story was incapable of holding up against scrutiny. Thus, the only inference was\n                    that the Respondent’s mark was a product of copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark.118    As this was not the first time the parties\n                    have been embroiled in litigation, the Appellant sought to draw the\n                    court’s attention to previous instances of litigation between the\n                    parties:(a)An opposition in South Korea Opposition No.\n                            40-2006-000245 in relation to the Respondent’s other mark\n                            “Estina Donna & Device” which was successfully opposed\n                            by the Appellant;(b)An opposition in relation to Korean Trade Mark\n                            Application No. 2002-0046412 for “J.ESTINA” in respect of\n                            Class 14 which was dismissed as the marks were found to be\n                            dissimilar and no likelihood of confusion was held to\n                        exist;(c)A decision by the Office for Harmonisation in the\n                            Internal Market (“OHIM”) in respect of Opposition No.\n                            B765356 issued on 26 April 2006 in favour of Appellant. The Respondent\n                            submitted that the OHIM had issued its decision based on evidence before\n                            it without having considered any submissions or representations by the\n                            Respondent as it had, for purely commercial reasons, not filed any\n                            observation or response to the Appellant’s opposition. The\n                            Respondent was there seeking to use the mark “JOVANNA\n                            ESTINA” instead of “J.ESTINA” in\n                        Europe;(d)A censure issued by the Arbitration Panel at\n                            Baselworld (Watch and Jewellery Show) on 2 April 2006 which prohibited\n                            the Respondent from using “J.ESTINA” in relation to, among\n                            other things, jewellery, precious stones, horological and chronometric\n                            instruments for the duration of the show. The Respondent submitted that\n                            the Arbitration Panel was an unofficial adjudicating body having no\n                            juridical authority over the parties and its decision should have no\n                            bearing upon the court’s decision here. Further, as the trade show\n                            was for a short duration only, it was simply not expedient to contest\n                            the Appellant’s allegations.As the PAR rightly observed, litigation between the parties in other\n                    jurisdictions serves at best as guides to opposition proceedings here. The\n                    relevance of these decisions will hinge upon the similarity of the laws of the\n                    particular jurisdiction with those of Singapore and also upon the individual\n                    facts of the case, at [118] of GD.119    The Appellant also pointed out that the\n                    Respondent had sought to register the mark “Jovanna Estina” in\n                    Singapore on 20 June 2008 in Trade Mark No. T 0808240Z, in respect of\n                    Class 14 goods. This date fell between the date of notice of opposition\n                    filed by the Appellant (22 September 2006) and the date the GD was rendered\n                    (8 February 2009). The fact that the Respondent thought it necessary to\n                    register an alternative mark in respect of the identical class of goods between\n                    those dates could not be coincidental. The Appellant, by way of Mr. Javier\n                    Ribas’ statutory declaration, submitted that the Respondent’s action\n                    was an indication that it was not confident that it would be able to avoid being\n                    held to be in infringement of the Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”\n                    by its use of “J.ESTINA”.120    In Mr. Myoung-chul Shin’s\n                    statutory declaration, it was said that a commissioned group was set up in order\n                    to come up with a brand name for their jewellery/watch line. A total of 14\n                    European-sounding names were suggested and considered and by process of\n                    elimination, “J.ESTINA” was chosen. A Report on Result of Naming\n                    Research for New Business was made on 1 October 2002 in which\n                    “J.ESTINA” was finally selected, accompanied by a note stating\n                    that “a crown device may be added”. The letter “J”\n                    in “J.ESTINA” was said to have derived from\n                    “Jovanna” who was an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. This\n                    brand story appears on the Respondent’s website which shows a princess, a\n                    tiara, and her pet car “Jenna”.121    A graphic presentation (in the form of a\n                    mind map) of the various names that were considered, amongst them being\n                    “J.ESTINA”, was also adduced as evidence in the Bundle of\n                    Documents, Volume II Part B. The graphic presentation showed the various factors\n                    that were taken into account in the process of naming,ie, originality, luxury, royal family, targeting consumers\n                    between 25 and 35 years of age. The graphic presentation also showed that the\n                    brand slogan was “Modern Renaissance” and the brand concept was\n                    one of “European Modern Jewellery”. Three graphs were similarly\n                    adduced to show the process of elimination of the other shortlisted13 names and\n                    also the degree of registrability of the final five names.122    In my opinion, the Respondent’s brand\n                    story on the name “J.ESTINA” appears extremely contrived. Firstly,\n                    the use of Princess Jovanna’s name (compressed to “J.”) only\n                    explains the use of the letter “J”. It does not explain why the\n                    meaningless word “ESTINA” was chosen. The six letters in\n                    “ESTINA” are not even the initials of “Jovanna Elizabeth\n                    Antonia Romana Marie” nor do they have any nexus with the tiara or the\n                    pet cat “Jenna” which were repeatedly referred to whenever the\n                    question of derivation of the brand name was raised. The brand story certainly\n                    does not answer any of the queries regarding the derivation of\n                    “ESTINA”. As mentioned at[90]above, giving a European setting to the story merely reinforces the association\n                    between the two competing marks.123    The graphs which supposedly illustrate the\n                    process of ultimately choosing the name “J.ESTINA” also do not\n                    explain in any way how the word “ESTINA” came into being. As the\n                    Respondent has conceded, “ESTINA” is an invented word with no\n                    meaning. The failure to furnish the court with a credible explanation of how\n                    “ESTINA” in the brand name “J.ESTINA” was derived,\n                    where the explanation is particularly pertinent since 6 out of 7 letters are in\n                    identical sequence in the two competing marks, can only lead to the irresistible\n                    conclusion that the word “ESTINA” was blatantly copied from the\n                    Appellant by a “cut and paste” job. The adding of\n                    “J” with a dot just before “ESTINA” makes little\n                    difference to the final name as both words in the competing marks (including the\n                    Appellant’s other marks) would still look alike and sound remarkably\n                    similar whether “J.ESTINA” is pronounced\n                    “jay-estina” (with the “jay” sound likely to be\n                    slurred) or “jes-tina”. Such outright copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark is an act that falls short of the acceptable commercial\n                    behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade.124    In these circumstances, the\n                    Respondent’s registration of T05/25465Z was undoubtedly made in bad faith.\n                    I therefore have to disagree with the PAR on this issue as well and allow the\n                    Appellant’s objection based on s 7(6) TMA. The Respondent’s\n                    application to register its mark should accordingly be refused.Conclusion125    For the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Appellant’s appeal is allowed on the basis of its opposition based on\n                    s 7(6) and s 8(2)(b) TMA.126    The Respondent is to pay the Appellant the\n                    costs of this appeal which are to be taxed or agreed.127    I thank counsel for both parties for their\n                    written and oral submissions which were of great assistance to me.",
        "Facts pertaining to the Respondent": "6       The Respondent’s mark, on the other hand,\n                    consists of the word “J.ESTINA” with a crown device positioned on\n                    the top of it as seen below:  7       In a Statutory Declaration made by the General\n                    Manager of “J.ESTINA” division of the Respondent,\n                    Mr. Myoung-chul Shin, it was deposed that the Respondent is a South Korean\n                    manufacturer of watches established in April 1998. The watches manufactured\n                    include luxury jewellery watches, prestige-grade watches, business watches,\n                    fashionable watches and casual watches. 8       The Respondent ventured into the jewellery\n                    market in 2002. On 16 December 2005, it filed for registration of the\n                    Respondent’s mark by way of application number T05/25465Z for\n                    Class 14 goods with respect to “wrist watches, electric watches,\n                    desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, ring bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                    brooches” in Singapore. As the Respondent’s mark has not been used\n                    here, the Respondent tendered evidence of approximate sales value of jewellery,\n                    watches and horological articles under the Respondent’s mark in countries\n                    such as China and Vietnam.",

        "PAR’s findings with respect to s 8(2)(b) TMA": "9       Section 8(2)(b)\n                    TMA reads as follow: Relative grounds for refusal of\n                        registration 8. — (1) (2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because — … (b) it issimilar to an earlier trade markand is to be registered forgoods or services identical\n                            with or similar tothose for which the earlier trade mark is\n                        protected, thereexists a likelihood of confusionon\n                        the part of the public. [emphasis added] 10     The PAR found that: (a)The Appellant’s mark 1 was the relevant\n                            “earlier trade mark” for the purposes of\n                                s 8(2)(b) TMA. The\n                            Appellant’s other marks were therefore not considered, at [53] of\n                            GD;(b)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were visually dissimilar, at [59] of\n                        GD;(c)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were aurally similar, at [61] of\n                        GD;(d)The Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                            Respondent’s mark were conceptually dissimilar, at [64] of\n                            GD;(e)The goods in the Respondent’s application\n                            in respect of “wrist watches, electric watches, desk clocks,\n                            alarm clocks” were identical to the Appellant’s registered\n                            goods in Class 14,ie,\n                            “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, at\n                            [71] of GD;(f)The goods in the Respondent’s application\n                            in respect of “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                            brooches” were similar to those of the Appellant’s\n                            registered goods in Class 14,ie,\n                            “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, at\n                            [73] of GD;(g)There was no likelihood of confusion between the\n                            Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark, at [84] of\n                            GD.Accordingly, the appellant failed on this ground of\n                opposition.PAR’s findings with respect to s 7(6) TMA11     Section 7(6) TMA stipulates:Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration7. — (1) ...(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith.The PAR found that the evidence tendered before her did not show that\n                    the Respondent’s actions fell short of the standards of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    area of trade, at [113] of GD. Thus, the Appellant’s opposition under bad\n                    faith failed.The Appellant’s submissions on appeal12     The Appellant submitted that there are visual,\n                    aural and conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.13     The Appellant’s approach during the\n                    course of submissions was a strategic one. It first sought to demonstrate that\n                    the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25,ie,\n                    those which the Appellant’s various trade marks were registered under,\n                    could be broadly and rationally categorised as “fashion\n                    accessories”. Flowing from this logic, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent’s goods in Class 14 wereat\n                        leastsimilar to the Appellant’s goods in respect of\n                    Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25 as they were all “fashion\n                    accessories”. The implication of such, as submitted by the Appellant, was\n                    that the relevant “earlier mark” for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA included not only the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 (as held by the PAR) but also the Appellant’s\n                    other marks. This was crucial to strengthening the Appellant’s case as the\n                    Appellant’s other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) bore\n                    greater visual similarity to the Respondent’s mark, a point conceded by\n                    the Respondent.14     Applying the global appreciation test, the\n                    Appellant took the position that a likelihood of confusion existed on the part\n                    of the public between the Respondent’s mark and the Appellant’s mark\n                    1 (and the Appellant’s other marks if the Court accepts the\n                    Appellant’s submission above) within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA.15     For the claim of bad faith under s 7(6)\n                    TMA, the Appellant submitted that the PAR erred in finding that there was no bad\n                    faith on the Respondent’s part. The Appellant submitted that Respondent\n                    was very likely to have been aware of the Appellant’s mark and its\n                    reputation. This, compounded by the Respondent’s failure to respond by way\n                    of counterstatement to the allegation of bad faith and the unsatisfactory\n                    explanation given by the Respondent regarding the derivation of the brand name\n                    “J.ESTINA” suggested that the Respondent must have copied the\n                    Appellant’s mark. Thus, the application to register the Respondent’s\n                    mark in such circumstances must have been made in bad faith.The Respondent’s submissions on appeal16     The Respondent took the view that the\n                    Appellant’s appeal against the PAR’s findings in respect of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA was misconceived. Faced\n                    with the Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9,\n                    14, 18 and 25 as being similar in nature which would entitle the court to\n                    consider the Appellant’s other marks, the Respondent submitted that there\n                    was no overlap between the specification of goods for the Appellant’s\n                    marks in Classes 9, 18 and 25 with that of the Respondent’s\n                    Class 14 goods. Hence, the Respondent maintained that the relevant\n                    “earlier mark” that the court was entitled to consider was\n                    confined to the Appellant’s mark 1 for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.17     The Respondent also submitted that there were\n                    no visual, aural or conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s and\n                    Respondent’s marks and that there was no likelihood of confusion between\n                    the two marks.18     Given its stance that the two marks were\n                    completely different, the Respondent submitted that there was no issue of bad\n                    faith that needed to be addressed. As the Appellant had provided no distinct\n                    proof of unacceptable commercial behaviour, its claim against the Respondent in\n                    respect of bad faith under s 7(6) TMA must necessarily fail.Decision of the courtStandard of Review of Present Proceedings19     Order 87 rule 4 Rules of Court (Cap 322,\n                    R 5, 2006, Rev Ed) (“ROC”) applies to appeals against the\n                    decision of the Trade Marks PAR pursuant to s 75(2)(a) TMA.

The need for a conjunctive reading of these three conditions was also\n                    emphasised by the Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v\n                        Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR(R) 690\n                    (“The Polo/Lauren Co”) at [8] albeit in the context of the trade\n                    marks infringement provision,ie,\n                        s 27(2)(b) TMA, the wording of which\n                    mirrors that of s 8(2)(b) TMA:While we can see some link and overlap between the first and the third\n                        conditions, it is clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is\n                        similar to a registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be\n                        a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                        fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                        circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter of\n                        degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between a mark\n                        and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not\n                            satisfied there will not be any need to go into the third question of\n                            determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does\n                            it mean that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on\n                            similar goods, that there willipso factobe confusion in the minds of the public. If that was\n                        intended, s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                        phrased differently. As presently worded,there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are\n                            present. …[emphasis added]Condition 1: Similarity of marks25     The Respondent’s mark and the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 are both composite marks which consist of a pictorial\n                    element and a word element. The two marks are as follow:Respondent’s markAppellant’s mark 1The decided cases suggest that there are three aspects to similarity:\n                    visual, aural and conceptual. Whether there is a similarity of marks in these\n                    three aspects is essentially a question of fact, seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at [9].26     As noted in[10]above, the PAR found that these two marks were aurally\n                    similar but were not visually and conceptually similar.(1)   Visual Similarity27     The Appellant submitted that the PAR had erred\n                    in concluding that the two marks were visually dissimilar. It was accepted that\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 was a composite mark consisting of a crest device\n                    with the word “FESTINA” emblazoned across the curved banner below\n                    the pictorial element.28     The PAR at [57] and [58] of the GD made a\n                    comparison between the two marks and found:(a)In relation to the Respondent’s mark,\n                            “J.ESTINA” was a dominant component as the word\n                            “J.ESTINA” constituted half or more of the\n                            Respondent’s mark. As for the crown device, it was much smaller in\n                            size in relation to the word “J.ESTINA”.(b)As for the Appellant’s mark 1, the crest\n                            formed the dominant component while the word “FESTINA” was\n                            subsumed within the curved banner of the crest. It was opined that\n                            crests were normally intricately designed with complicated elements such\n                            that, generally, consumers would not be able to recall their exact\n                            details save for the impression that the crest was part of the\n                            mark.29     It was the Appellant’s submission that\n                    crests and coats-of-arms are nowadays commonly used on a wide variety of goods\n                    ranging from watches, foodstuffs and beverages. It was said that the\n                    consumers’ eyes are usually drawn to the words in such a mark in order to\n                    ascertain the origin of the goods. In other words, even where a crest forms a\n                    dominant part of the trade mark, it will have a “negligible\n                    effect” when the average consumer recalls the trade mark. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 would be remembered and accordingly be described as\n                    “FESTINA” (ie, word element) since\n                    the crest element (ie, pictorial element) cannot\n                    be verbalized. This, combined with the imperfect recollection of an average\n                    consumer, in terms of visual recognition, is likely to militate against\n                    distinguishing between the two marks “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.30     The European Court of Justice\n                    (“ECJ”) has emphasised that the assessment of similarity between\n                    two marks must be based on the overall impression created by them, in\n                    particular, of their distinctive and dominant components, seeSabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport, Case C-251/95\n                    [1997] ECR I- 6191 andLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v\n                        Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343.\n                    Thus, in deciding whether there are visual similarities between the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark, I agree with the PAR\n                    that with respect to the Respondent’s mark, the word\n                    “J.ESTINA” formed the dominant part of the mark whereas for the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1, the crest was the dominant aspect f. To this extent,\n                    there is no visual similarity between the two marks.31     The Appellant submitted that there are\n                    instances whereby the overall impression conveyed to the relevant public by a\n                    composite mark may be dominated by one or more of its components, seeMatratzen Concord GmbH v OHIM, Case T- 6/01\n                    [2002] ECR II-4335 at [32].Medion AG v Thomson\n                        Multimedia Sales Germany & Austria GmbH, Case C- 120/04\n                    [2005] ECR I-8551 (“Medion”) was also cited by the\n                    Appellant as authority that it is still possible that a non-dominant component\n                    of a composite mark might have an independent distinctive role in the composite\n                    mark, see [30] ofMedion. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s position was that even if “FESTINA” was not the\n                    dominant element of the Appellant’s mark 1, its distinctive role would\n                    support its contention that the two marks were in fact visually\n                similar.32     The Appellant’s reliance onMedionshould be read in context in order to fully\n                    appreciate the reasoning behind the decision of the ECJ. The ECJ envisaged that\n                    notwithstanding that the overall impression of the average consumer may be\n                    dominated by one or more components of a composite mark, there might be\n                    instances whereby anon-dominant elementof a\n                    composite mark would nevertheless be so distinctive (viz, by virtue of its widely-known commercial name) such that\n                    the public may be led to believe that the goods or services at issue were\n                    derived from economically linked companies, in which case the “likelihood\n                    of confusion” must be held to be established, see [31] and [32] ofMedion.33     As seen above, the driving force behind the\n                    ECJ’s reasoning that there existed a “likelihood of\n                    confusion” between the two marks was because thenon-dominant but distinctive elementof the composite mark was\n                    one that wasin itselfalready widely-known, see\n                    [34] ofMedion. Thus, it is pertinent to note thatMediondoes not purport to confer upon\n                    otherwise dissimilar marks a greater degree of visual similarity by virtue of\n                    some distinctiveness in the earlier mark.34     Thus, even if one considers the word\n                    “FESTINA” to be non-dominant but distinctive, it is not sufficient\n                    in and by itself to establish that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are thereby visually similar. I therefore accept that\n                    there is no visual similarity between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.(2)   Conceptual Similarity35     The PAR at [63] of the GD noted that the\n                    addition of crest-like designs (eg, that of the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1) had over time been considered to be a design element\n                    which lends a “high-class” look to a mark. However, she opined\n                    that the same could not be said of a crown device (eg, that of Respondent’s mark) since it continues to this\n                    day to connote and evoke the idea of royal patronage. Thus, it was held that the\n                    two marks were conceptually dissimilar.36     The Appellant submitted that the proper\n                    comparison between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark\n                    in the assessment of conceptual similarity should be that the two marks were of\n                    a combination of a “foreign sort of name” and a device which hints\n                    at royalty. On this premise, the Appellant submitted that there was conceptual\n                    similarity between the two marks. Alternatively, the Appellant submitted that\n                    the crest and crown devices were conceptually neutral.37     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark were\n                    conceptually dissimilar as the crest device and the crown device conveyed\n                    different ideas. For instance, a crown device would convey an impression of\n                    royalty whereas a crest device,eg, crest of\n                    Singapore, would not.38     Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press,\n                        3rdEd, 2009) (“Bently\n                        & Sherman”) noted at p 866 that in relation to\n                    “conceptual similarity”:Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of theideas that lie behind or inform\n                            the earlier mark. [emphasis added]39     A clear case of conceptual dissimilarity can\n                    be seen inPhillips – Van Heusen, T–\n                    292/01 [2003] ECR II – 4335 where “BASS” was found\n                    to be conceptually dissimilar to “PASH” as the former was\n                    understood as a musical reference whereas the latter either had no meaning or\n                    referred to German dice.40Itochu Corporation v\n                        Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9\n                    (“Itochu”) offers a more nuanced illustration of conceptual\n                    similarity. InItochu, the PAR (and subsequently\n                    the High Court) held that the marks “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” were conceptually dissimilar: the\n                    “CAMEL” mark evoked a sense of “ruggedness, adventure and\n                    masculinity” whereas the applicant’s mark\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” which was preceded by the adjective\n                    “SWEET” projected a totally opposite impression.41     In the case ofOzone\n                        Community Corp, the two marks in issue were\n                    “GLAMOUR” and “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”. The PAR found that\n                    both marks were in some way conceptually similar as both marks used the\n                    “glamour” concept, despite one appealing to the orthodox meaning\n                    while the other giving the concept a spin without completely altering its\n                    texture. This finding was upheld by the High Court at [64].42     In the case ofImperial\n                        Tobacco Co (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd’s Trade Marks[1915] 2 Ch 27 (“Imperial Tobacco”), albeit decided in the context\n                    of whether the use of Prince of Wales plumes (part of the Prince of Wales\n                    heraldic achievements) which formed part of the proprietor’s trade mark\n                    amounted to an act of “calculative deception”, Lord Cozens- Hardy\n                    MR noted that the Prince of Wales feathers had for many years to a very great\n                    extent been used by traders of every kind in such a way that the mere use of\n                    them did not by itself indicate to anybody with a rational mind that the person\n                    so using it was a warrant holder. Concurring with Lord Cozens-Hardy MR, Pickford\n                    LJ further observed that:I have no doubt whatever that many kinds of articles are at the present\n                        moment described by the names of persons distinguished in the war, butno one imagines that that practice means anything\n                            more than giving those articles an attractive name, and I\n                        cannot imagine there is anything more than that in using the name of the\n                        Prince of Wales.[emphasis added]Notably, this passage buttresses the PAR’s finding at [63] of\n                    the GD that the use of a crest, in the modern context, is used to lend a\n                    “high-class” look to a mark design as an attraction to the average\n                    consumer as opposed to signifying royal patronage.43     The PAR further opined that the crown device\n                    connotes and evokes the idea of royal patronage. It is probable that the crown\n                    device would evoke a sense of royalty, which is in line with the\n                    Respondent’s brand story of an Italian princess who later became a\n                    Bulgarian queen. However, a crown device in modern usage does not signify only\n                    royal patronage. Borrowing the example of Eve J inImperial Tobacco, I do not think that an average consumer would\n                    be disappointed in finding out that the smoking mixture she purchased was not\n                    supplied for the personal use of the Prince of Wales. In the same vein, nor\n                    would the consumer be disappointed if she discovers that the watch she purchased\n                    was not used by an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. The crown device, in\n                    the modern day, is more likely to evoke a sense of royalty or class and status\n                    rather than royal patronage.44     The PAR at [63] of the GD appeared to have\n                    emphasized solely on the conceptual (dis)similarity between the crown and crest\n                    devices as the invented words were conceptually neutral. I accept the\n                    Appellant’s submission that as the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are composite marks, they should be viewed as a whole.\n                    Thus, the pictorial element as well as the word element should be taken into\n                    account while assessing the conceptual similarities between the marks. The\n                    Appellant’s alternative submission that the crown and crest concepts are\n                    neutral has to be rejected as both do evokesomequalities.45     In my view, insofar as the two marks comprise\n                    an invented word, in that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA”\n                    are not English terms found in dictionaries, and that both employ a pictorial\n                    element that hints at “class” and “status”, there\n                    aresomeconceptual similarities between the two\n                    marks, as opposed to complete or significant similarities, bearing in mind that\n                    the crest and crown devices evoke a sense of class but only the crown device\n                    evokes a sense of royalty.(3)   Aural Similarity46     The PAR at [61] of the GD found that there\n                    were aural similarities between the Appellant’s mark\n                    “FESTINA” and the Respondent’s mark “J.ESTINA”\n                    given that there is little difference between the sounds which the letters\n                    “F” and “J” make at the beginning of the words such\n                    that the pronunciation would largely focus on “ESTINA”. The PAR\n                    also found that while the Respondent’s mark was in the form of\n                    “J.ESTINA”, it was likely that the average consumer would\n                    pronounce it as “jes-tina”.47     At the PAR hearing below and on appeal, the\n                    Respondent sought to differentiate between “FESTINA” (pronounced\n                    as “fes-tina”) and “J.ESTINA” (pronounced as\n                    “jay-estina”) because the former comprises three syllables as\n                    opposed to the latter’s four syllables. The Respondent also submitted that\n                    Sargant LJ’s observation inLondon Lubricants (1920)\n                        Limited’s Application to Register a Trade Mark[1925]\n                    42 RPC 264 at 279 was instructive:[That] the tendency of persons using the English language to slur the\n                        termination of words also has the effect necessarily that the beginning of\n                        words is accentuated in comparison, and… the first syllable of a word\n                        is, as a rule, far [sic] the most important\n                        for the purpose of distinction.This observation, useful as it is, should not be taken as a hard and\n                    fast rule of pronunciation in the English language. The Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] rightly held that\n                    there is no rigid principle that the first syllable of a word mark is more\n                    important than other syllables.48     InMystery Drinks Gmbh v\n                        OHIM, T 99/01 [2004] ETMR (18) 217 (“Mystery\n                    Drinks”), the applicant argued that the two words “MIXERY”\n                    and “MYSTERY” were aurally different as the “i” in\n                    “MIXERY” was shorter and clearer than the “y” in\n                    “MYSTERY” and the “x” in “MIXERY” was\n                    pronounced differently from the “st” of “MYSTERY”.\n                    The European Court of First Instance (“CFI”) rejected this\n                    argument as such aural differences (as submitted by the applicant) could only be\n                    detected if one carried out a fragmented analysis, syllable by syllable, and\n                    completely omitted the comparison of the pronunciation of the words as a whole.\n                    In a similar fashion, the Respondent’s distinction of the number of\n                    syllables of the “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by\n                    dissecting the respective words and then analysing them at a micro-level\n                    overlooks the bigger picture that words are pronounced as a whole.49     In any event, it is more likely than not that\n                    the average consumer when pronouncing the words “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA” (whether pronounced as “Jes-ti-na” or\n                    “Jay-es-ti-na”) would stress “-estina”. The\n                    beginning letters of the words,ie,\n                    “F” and “J”, are consonants which would probably be\n                    given less emphasis. Thus, I agree with the PAR’s finding that there are\n                    aural similarities between “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.(4)   Overall similarity between the two marks50     As seen above, the Appellant’s mark 1\n                    and the Respondent’s mark are visually dissimilar but conceptually and\n                    aurally similar.51     The law does not require all three\n                    similarities to be established before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia\n                        Networks plc[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496 (“Mediacorp”) at [32]). As noted inBently & Shermanat pp 863-864:Typically, tribunals consider [visual, aural and conceptual similarities]\n                        in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they have\n                        observed that atrade-offcan occur: visual\n                        and conceptual differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities.[emphasis added]52     Hence, the relative importance of each type of\n                    similarity would vary with the circumstances of each case, in particular the\n                    type of goods and the type of mark. The case ofMystery\n                        Drinksserves as a useful illustration on this point. There, the\n                    CFI at [225] held that:Since the goods in question are also consumedafter\n                            being ordered orally, theaural similarity\n                            of the signs in question is in itself sufficient to give rise to\n                            likelihood of confusion. [emphasis added]53     There is much wisdom in the\n                    “trade-off” approach as it accords a degree of flexibility and\n                    latitude to the courts in coming to a conclusion (with regard to the overall\n                    similarity of marks) against a contextual background by adapting to the ever\n                    evolving commercial reality. For instance, it recognises that in this modern\n                    age, one is able to purchase a timepiece over the Internet, as opposed to the\n                    more conventional trade channels such as departmental stores or specialised\n                    boutiques. It is not denied that an average consumer would rely on his own\n                    visual recognition of a trade mark to differentiate among the various brands for\n                    timepieces. However, this visual recognition is often accompanied by the\n                    “verbalisation” of the mark,iethe\n                    name of the mark. The significance of the verbalisation will, in turn, depend on\n                    the particular mode of purchase of the consumer.54Shaker de L. Laudato &\n                        C. Sas v Limiñana y Botella, SL, Case C-334/05P\n                        (“Shaker”) highlights the\n                    significance of “verbalization” of a mark. InShaker, the applicant sought to register a composite mark for\n                    alcoholic beverages which included the word “LIMONCELLO” above an\n                    image of a plate decorated with six lemons. This was opposed by the owner of a\n                    Spanish word mark “LIMONCHELO” with respect to goods in\n                    Class 33. The CFI held that the signs were dissimilar because of the\n                    dominance of the dish feature in the applicant’s mark which was absent in\n                    the opponent’s mark. The authors ofBently &\n                        Shermancommented at p 864 that “this finding was itself\n                    surprising,given the general tendency to emphasize verbal\n                        components”. The ECJ overturned the CFI’s finding\n                    and reiterated that the assessment was a global one and should not be conducted\n                    by comparing only one element.(A)   Applying the significance of verbalizing a mark to the\n                context of purchase of a watch55     By way of an example, if a consumer chooses to\n                    purchase a “FESTINA” timepiece online, he could either buy it from\n                    a “FESTINA”e-store (assuming there is one) or from a website\n                    which hosts a variety of brands. In the former situation, the name or word\n                    element “FESTINA” has to be typed into the address bar or search\n                    engine for the consumer to be brought to the desired website. In the latter\n                    situation, the name or word element “FESTINA” will be found in a\n                    list of brand names on the relevant website. In both instances, one needs to\n                    recall the word element, “FESTINA”, as opposed to the crest\n                    element of the trade mark. Hence, the visual impact of the mark,ie, the crest, will be less significant as compared to\n                    the aural and visual impact of the word “FESTINA” despite the\n                    crest element being the dominant component of the mark.56     In a situation where a consumer chooses to buy\n                    a “FESTINA” timepiece from a shop, the visual recognition of the\n                    crest device in the trade mark may be of greater significance. Nevertheless,\n                    there is still a need to verbalize the word “FESTINA”. An average\n                    consumer usually identifies a trade mark by virtue of its pictorial element (if\n                    any)andits name/ word element. Even where the\n                    pictorial device forms the dominant element of a trade mark, it would be\n                    extremely rare for a consumer to describe the product by its pictorial element\n                    because the description of, say, the crest, is a much more difficult task, given\n                    its intricacy, as compared to the relatively easy articulation of the word\n                    element/ brand name. Thus, the aural similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    mark 1 and the Respondent mark would militate against the visual dissimilarity\n                    in this instance.(B)   Distinctiveness in the earlier mark57     The issue of distinctiveness of the earlier\n                    mark “FESTINA and device” was not discussed in the GD in the\n                    assessment of similarity of marks. Likewise, parties on appeal did not submit on\n                    the point of distinctiveness. Woo J has observed inOzone Community Corpat [67] that the distinctiveness of the\n                    earlier mark, either inherent or acquired, is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.58     Registrationper\n                        seis inconclusive as to the distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                        (The Polo/Lauren Coat [72]). Chao Hick Tin JA\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] also said:We recognise that some marks areinherently\n                            distinctivebecause they consist ofinventive words without any notional or allusive quality. An\n                        example would be \"Volvo\".[emphasis added]Given that “FESTINA” is an invented word, it possesses\n                    inherent distinctiveness and such distinctive quality would be taken into\n                    account in the overall assessment of similarity between the marks.59Bently &\n                        Shermanoffers some useful observation on the interplay between\n                    the distinctiveness of an earlier mark and the similarity of marks at pp 866-867\n                    (footnotes omitted):Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effects.First, the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the less literal or\n                        visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later mark is not similar.\n                        … InReed Executive plc v Reed Business\n                            Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ\n                        stated that ‘where a mark is descriptive [as opposed to distinctive]\n                        small differences may suffice to avoid confusion’… Where the\n                        distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will\n                        have to be in close proximity for it to be similar. …Second,if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then\n                            a mark that has been substantially modified might nonetheless be\n                            similar. …[emphasis added]60     As “FESTINA” is an invented word\n                    with inherent distinctiveness, a modification ofat\n                        leasta substantial degree has to be done for the\n                    Respondent’s mark to be found to be dissimilar to it. A comparison of the\n                    two composite marks shows that:(a)A crown device can be seen in both\n                        marks;(b)The Appellant’s crest device is not present\n                            in the Respondent’s mark;(c)Six out of seven letters in the Appellant’s\n                            word element of its composite mark,ie,\n                            “ESTINA”, are found in the Respondent’s\n                        mark;(d)The first letter “F” in the\n                            Appellant’s word element in its composite mark is replaced by a\n                            “J” and “.” in the Respondent’s\n                            mark.The word element of the Respondent’s mark\n                    “J.ESTINA” does not seem to be very dissimilar from the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”. It is likely that the imperfect\n                    recollection of a consumer who rarely has the opportunity to juxtapose the two\n                    marks and make a comparison may think the marks are similar, seeLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case\n                    C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343, 1358-1359.61     Given that there is significant aural\n                    similarity between “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” and\n                    taking into account the inherent distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                    “FESTINA”, I conclude that there is similarity between the two\n                    marks within the meaning of s 8(2)(b)\n                    TMA.Condition 2: Similarity of goods62     As noted inBently &\n                        Shermanat p 869, “the question of whether goods or\n                    services are similar depends on the facts of the case”. The goods which\n                    the Respondent’s application relates to are “wrist watches,\n                    electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches”. On the other hand, the goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 (ie, Class 14\n                    goods) was registered include “watches, clocks and other chronometric\n                    instruments”.63     The PAR found that there was identity between\n                    “wrist watches, electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and\n                    “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, see [71] of\n                    GD. As for the remaining goods of the Respondent’s application,ie, “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings,\n                    medals and brooches”, the PAR found that there was some similarity\n                    between them and the Appellant’s Class 14 goods as watches and\n                    jewellery have similar use as being articles of adornment although watches have\n                    the additional function of being able to tell the time, see [73] of GD. I agree\n                    with these findings made by the PAR.64     The PAR held at [53] of the GD that the goods\n                    in Classes 9, 18 and 25 (ie, goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s other marks were registered) were not identical or similar\n                    to the goods of the Respondent’s mark. On appeal, the Appellant argued\n                    that the PAR erred in this respect. For ease of reference, the goods in\n                    Classes 9, 18 and 25 are as below:Classes of goods which the Appellant’s other\n                                        marks were registered forSpecification of goods in the Respondent’s\n                                        applicationClass\n                                                9SpectaclesClass\n                                                14Wrist watches, electric\n                                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings,\n                                            bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                                    brooches.Class\n                                                18Leather and imitation\n                                            leather; goods made of these materials and not included\n                                            in other classes; animal skins and hides; trunks and\n                                            suitcases; umbrellas; parasols and walking sticks;\n                                            whips, harness and saddleryClass\n                                                25Clothing and\n                                        footwear65     The Respondent submitted that the goods\n                    falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were evidently dissimilar from those of\n                    Class 14 as there was no overlap of goods. The Respondent objected to the\n                    Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and\n                    25 as “fashion accessories” as this would entail an expansion of\n                    the categories to include goods which otherwise would not be so classified. Such\n                    an unwarranted expansion was said to have the effect of defeating the whole\n                    purpose of having a system of classification. However, this submission may not\n                    be entirely correct. The fact that goods are classified into various classes\n                    under the ICGS does not preclude a finding that those goods are nevertheless\n                    similar in nature. This is because goods are so classified for administrative\n                    convenience whereas the question of whether goods are similar is an issue of\n                    substantive law, seeEl Corte Ingles SA v OHIM,\n                    Case T-443/05 [2007] ETMR (81) 1340 (“El\n                        Corte Ingles”) at [38].66     The Appellant, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the relevant goods were “fashion accessories” and citedBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons\n                        Ltd[1996] RPC 281 (“British\n                        Sugar”) which was endorsed byOzone\n                        Community Corpat [75] as the proper test to be used in\n                    determining whether the goods were similar. The factors that were to be taken\n                    into account were (British Sugarat\n                    296-297):(a)The respective uses of the respective\n                            goods;(b)The respective end users of the respective\n                            goods;(c)The physical nature of the goods;(d)The respective trade channels through which the\n                            goods reach the market;(e)In the case of self-serve consumer items, whether\n                            in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found on the\n                            same or different shelves; and(f)Whether the respective goods are competitive or\n                            complementary. This inquiry may take into account how those in the trade\n                            classify goods, for instance whether market research companies who act\n                            for the industry put the goods or services in the same or different\n                            sectors.67     The Appellant further submitted thatQS by S. Oliver Trade Mark[1999] RPC 520\n                        (“QS”) was a constructive\n                    indicator of “similarity of goods”. InQS, it was held that leather goods, leather bags, purses,etcwould be regarded as “clothing\n                    accessories”. This was because these items were found to be complementary\n                    to clothing, had the same users and trade channels, and both would be found\n                    adjacent to each other in retail outlets.68     Building on this line of reasoning, the\n                    Appellant submitted that goods falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were\n                    frequently designed and manufactured by a single entity as they were all\n                    considered as fashion accessories and were complementary to the consumer’s\n                    style or get up. The Appellant pointed to various stores in Singapore such as\n                    “Calvin Klein” and “DKNY” where a diverse range of\n                    clothing and accessories, such as clothing, bags, shoes, jewellery and watches,\n                    could be found in the same store as they were intended to be put together as a\n                    particular look or style.69     Furthermore, there is now a trend among\n                    fashion designers to either license out their name or engage in brand extension.\n                    For instance, a brand that was previously well-known for handbags may now be\n                    selling sunglasses, clothes or even phones with its trade mark affixed on such\n                    goods. Thus, it was the Appellant’s submission that a consumer would\n                    expect that goods falling within one of the “fashion-related\n                    classes”,eg, Class14 (watches) and\n                    Class 25 (clothing and footwear), to have originated from the same source\n                    or from economically-linked undertakings.70     This idea of “aesthetic harmony”\n                    or “aesthetic complementarity” was discussed inBently & Shermanwhere two conflicting lines of cases\n                    decided by differently constituted CFI were given some consideration. In the\n                    case ofSergio Rossi SpA v OHIM, Sissi Rossi, Case\n                    T-169/03 [2005] ECR II-685, the CFI held that women’s bags and\n                    women’s footwear were not “aesthetically complementary” as\n                    the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this aesthetic complementary nature\n                    had reached a stage of “true aesthetic necessity” in the sense\n                    that the consumers would think it unusual or shocking to carry a bag which does\n                    not perfectly match their shoes. Subsequently, a CFI of five judges held that\n                    bags and clothes were sufficiently complementary to be regarded as similar, seeEl-Corte Inglesat [38]. In the absence of an\n                    ECJ decision, the authors ofBently & Shermanat p 871 opined that the second view, which was more open to the idea that\n                    consumers might draw connections between goods because they are searching for\n                    “aesthetic harmony”, to be more consistent with the general idea\n                    of a fact-sensitive “global appreciation” by the\n                Court.71     As the Appellant rightly observed, there is a\n                    growing phenomenon of brands expanding into goods of various kinds in recent\n                    years. Sometimes, the crossing-over takes place between goods that one does not\n                    commonly associate with each other, for instance, cigarettes and clothing. The\n                    idea of licensing out one’s trade mark or engaging in a sister brand or\n                    diffusion line has inevitably led to the same trade mark being found on a\n                    multitude of goods available in the market. In this regard, there is force in\n                    the Appellant’s submissions that there is a sense of\n                    “relatedness” between goods such as necklaces and clothing and a\n                    broad classification of these items as “fashion accessories” or\n                    “lifestyle goods” may be justified.72     Applying theBritish\n                        Sugartest to the present facts, it would be reasonable in the\n                    modern context to regard the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 (trunks and\n                    suitcases and, in some instances, even umbrellas and parasols) and 25 as\n                    complementary in nature and are likely to be of similar uses, targeting almost\n                    identical end users and employing similar if not identical trade channels by\n                    which the goods reach the market. Thus, there issomesimilarity between “necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches” in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the goods for which the Appellant’s other marks are registered in\n                    Classes 9, 18 (the items specified above) and 25.73     However, the Appellant’s inclusion of\n                    the other goods in Class 18, such as walking sticks, whips, harness and\n                    saddlery, as “fashion accessories” would appear to be too\n                    over-reaching. To say that these items are “fashion accessories”\n                    which aresimilar to“necklaces, rings,\n                    bracelets, earrings, medal and brooches” would be to put an unnatural\n                    strain on the average consumer’s perception of what fashion accessories\n                    are. Thus, these items are not similar to the Class 14 goods in the\n                    Respondent’s application.74     The implication of the above finding that\n                    there is similarity between the goods in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the Appellant’s registered goods in Classes 9, 18 and 25 is that the\n                    Appellant’s other marks can be considered against the Respondent’s\n                    mark in determining whether there is a similarity of marks. For this purpose,\n                    the two competing marks are:Respondent’s markAppellant’s other marksTaking into account the Appellant’s other marks in the\n                    assessment lends even more force to the finding that there is similarity of\n                    marks as there is much greater visual similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.75     To summarize the findings thus far:(a)There is identity between the goods in the\n                            Respondent’s application for “wrist watches, electric\n                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and the Appellant’s\n                            goods in Class 14 for “watches, clocks and other\n                            chronometric instruments”;(b)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s Class 14\n                            goods;(c)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s goods in\n                            Classes 9, 18 (trunks and suitcases and, in some instances, even\n                            umbrellas and parasols) and 25.Indeed, with today’s creative proliferation of goods morphing and\n                    merging in functionalities and forms, one begins to wonder whether the\n                    classification of goods for trade mark purposes is becoming dated and whether it\n                    reflects present-day commerce.Condition 3: Likelihood of Confusion76     Having found that there is similarity of marks\n                    and identity in some goods and some similarity in others, we now turn to the\n                    assessment of whether there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                    public. As stated earlier, there is no presumption of confusion even where\n                    similarity of marks and goods are made out, seeOzone\n                        Community Corpat [81] and the Court of Appeal’s decision\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [8].77     Lee Seiu Kin J at [43] ofMediacorpdealt with the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion”:The following principles as to what constitutes \"likelihood of confusion\"\n                        can be distilled from the cases:(a)   The court is entitled to look outside the mark and\n                        the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                        likelihood of confusion (Polo/Lauren([29]supra) at [8]).(b)   The question of likelihood of confusion has to be\n                        looked at globally taking into account all the circumstances including\n                            (Polo/Laurenat [28]):(i)    the closeness of the goods;(ii)   the impression given by the marks;(iii)  the possibility of imperfect recollection;(iv)  the risk that the public might believe that the goods come\n                        from the same source or economically-linked sources;(v)   the steps taken by the defendant to differentiate the\n                        goods from those of the registered proprietor; and(vi)  the kind of customer who would be likely to buy the goods\n                        of the applicant and opponent.(c)   One should not determine the likelihood of confusion\n                        based on the man in a hurry, and the test should be the \"ordinary, sensible\n                        members of the public\" (Polo/Laurenat [31]).\n                        The average consumer is someone who would exercise some care and good sense\n                        in making his purchases (Polo/Laurenat [34]).\n                        However, the \"average consumer\" need not necessarily mean the general\n                        public, as more specialised products might be purchased by a more specific\n                        cross-section of the public (Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd\n                            v Oystertec plc[2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 at\n                        [97]).(d)   The ambit of the protection offered by\n                        the Act to a registered proprietor of a trade mark should be guided by the\n                        underlying aim of the trade marks regime, which is to ensure that consumers\n                        do not confuse the trade source of one product with another (Polo/Laurenat [32]). The policy of s 8 of the\n                        Act is to protect the public against deception. InWeir\n                            Warman Ltd v Research & Development Pty Ltd[2007]\n                        2 SLR(R) 1073 , V K Rajah JA observed that (at [41]):It is plain that the trade mark register is intended to be a\n                            comprehensive and accurate record of trade marks currently in use. As\n                            such, it is crucial to maintain the accuracy of the register and to\n                            ensure that undeserving and invalid trade marks are removed from the\n                            register without undue delay and complication.In\n                                addition, the register is meant to assure and endorse the function\n                                of registered trade marks as badges of origin ... so as to protect\n                                the public against deception. Hence marks that are misleading or\n                                likely to cause confusion or no longer serve their function should\n                                not be accepted or allowed to remain on the register, as the case\n                                may be. [emphasis added]To this end, mere association which the public may make between two trade\n                        marks because of their semantic content is not in itself a sufficient basis\n                        for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion, in the absence of\n                        any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods and\n                        services (Richemont International SA v Da Vinci\n                            Collections Pte Ltd(\"Richemont\") [2006] 4 SLR(R) 369 at [20]).(e)   The greater the exposure and use of a particular\n                        registered mark, the greater its reputation is likely to be, and therefore\n                        the greater the protection likely to be afforded to it (The Polo/Lauren Coat [34]).78     In relation to (a) above,ie, where “a court is entitled to look outside the mark\n                    and the sign”, Woo J inOzone Community\n                        Corpat [84] to [87] conducted a thorough review of the\n                    conflicting line of cases which differed on whether a court is entitled to\n                    consider extraneous factors in determining whether there is a likelihood of\n                    confusion and concluded in the affirmative. In addition to that, the ECJ inCanon Kabushiki Kaisha v Pathé Communications[1998] ETMR 366 andLloyd Schuhfabrikcases noted that the global assessment of likelihood of confusion implies some\n                    interdependence between the relevant factors, and in particular, similarity of\n                    marks and of goods.79     As pointed out earlier, both the\n                    Appellant’s and the Respondent’s marks have not been used in\n                    Singapore. Thus, an analysis of the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion” has to be made on the basis of a notional, normal and fair use\n                    of the marks, seeReact and Device Trade Mark[1999] RPC 529, 532.80     It is fair to say that the average consumer in\n                    Singapore is one who is literate, educated, exposed to the world and unlikely to\n                    be easily hoodwinked, seeMcDonald’s Corp v Future\n                        Enterprises Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177 at\n                [64].81     Having considered the various factors, the PAR\n                    held (at [84] of the GD) that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part\n                    of the public as:(a)The goods in question,ie, watches and fashion accessories, had some areas of\n                            overlap but were not substitutes and were normally bought after much\n                            scrutiny and not at a whim, at [76] of GD;(b)An average price of $400.00 was assigned to the\n                            Appellant’s and Respondent’s watches respectively. The PAR\n                            opined that at such a price, the consumers were not likely to be\n                            careless with their purchase, at [77] of GD;(c)Consumers of fashion accessories would be a\n                            “conscious lot” who would exercise “some form of\n                            brand loyalty” thus taking pains to ensure that the purchased\n                            goods were of a particular brand, at [78] of GD;(d)Against the backdrop of a proliferation of\n                            different brands and products, consumers would be more deliberate and\n                            circumspect in their selection and purchase, at [79] of\n                        GD;(e)The mode of sales via specialist boutiques and\n                            departmental stores would mean that the visual appearances of the marks\n                            would be the main differentiating factor, at [80] of GD;(f)The Respondent had taken steps to differentiate\n                            their goods,viz, jewellery and watches,\n                            from the Appellant’s by way of development of a brand story which\n                            portrays a romantic, fairytale-like image of an Italian princess and\n                            Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet cat.\n                            In contrast, the Appellant’s goods tend to portray a more mature\n                            and sensual image, at [81] to [83] of GD.82     The average consumer is exposed to a variety\n                    of brands. There is also an increasing trend of brands venturing into diffusion\n                    lines so as to target different sectors of consumers. For instance, a brand that\n                    used to be associated only with female users may now branch into products for\n                    male users as well. Similarly, a brand known for its upmarket products may want\n                    to make inroads into a more affordable product range. Consumers generally regard\n                    the main and diffusion lines to be of the same source.Bently\n                        & Shermanat p 872 discusses what “likelihood of\n                    confusion” under the UK equivalent of s 8(2)(b) TMA connotes (footnotes omitted):In its ‘classic’ form, consumers must be confused about the\n                        source or origin of the goods or services – that is, they must be\n                        confused as to the designer, manufacturer, selector or supplier of the goods\n                        or services. In other words, classic confusion is concerned with the\n                        situation where consumers believe that the goods or services emanate from\n                        one organization, but they, in fact come from a different independent\n                        organization. This classic form of confusion has been extended to\n                        accommodate broader understandings of the source of goods or services.\n                        Consequently, a person will be confused for the purposes of [UK equivalent\n                        of s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                        assume that there is some broader kind ofeconomic\n                            connectionbetween the users of marks, for example, that the\n                        goods are being provided by a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark\n                        owner. …In considering whether there is a likelihood of confusion, the tribunals\n                        must consider whether there is a genuine and properly substantiated\n                        likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that confusion is hypothetical and\n                        remote. The term ‘likelihood’ indicates probability rather than\n                        possibility. …[italics in original]83     Similar toCity Chain\n                        Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2010]\n                    1 SLR 382 (“City Chain\n                    Stores”), the Appellant’s goods in Class 14 include\n                    watches. The Court of Appeal inCity Chain Storesat [56] held that since a watch is a product which is commonly available and\n                    purchased by the general public, the average consumer would be the general\n                    public. Thus, it follows that the nature of the members of public is a relevant\n                    consideration. The Court of Appeal went on to say as follows:The average consumer is not an unthinking person in a hurry but someone\n                        who would exercise some care and good sense in making his purchases\n                        …Thus, it was held when luxury goods are purchased, they are bought\n                    after careful inspection and deliberation.(1)   Is there a possibility that the consumers would be confused\n                that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” are from the same or\n                economically-linked undertakings?84     In considering this question, the function of\n                    the respective marks as badges of origin of the goods becomes especially\n                    important. The marks “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” both\n                    end with “-ESTINA” which is part of an invented word with no\n                    meaning in itself. Apart from their similarity discussed earlier, one must also\n                    consider the possibility that the consumer would see the letters\n                    “ESTINA” as a common suffix and therefore associate goods with the\n                    same (invented) suffix “ESTINA” to be from economically-linked\n                    sources.85     In the case ofDurferrit\n                        GmbH v OHIM, T-244/01 [2003] ECR II-1589,\n                    “NUTRIDE” and “TUFFTRIDE” were held by the CFI to be\n                    dissimilar despite sharing the same suffix “-TRIDE. However, there are\n                    counter examples such asJulian James’ Application:\n                        Opposition of Smart GmbH[2005] ETMR (93) 1096 where\n                    “CARSMART” was held to be similar to “SMART” (albeit\n                    in part due to “CAR” being descriptive). Notably, these\n                    counter-examples serve to illustrate that rulings are\n                    “fact-specific” and asBently &\n                        Shermannotes at p 866, such examples have virtually no value as\n                    precedents.86     It was held inCity Chain\n                        Storesat [58] (approving the approach inRichemont International SA v Goldlion Enterprise (Singapore) Pte\n                        Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 401 at [20]) that in the absence of\n                    any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods or services,\n                    the mere association of the public between Solvil’s “Solvil\n                    Flower” and Louis Vuitton’s “Flower Quatrefoil mark”\n                    based on their similar use was not a sufficient basis for concluding that there\n                    is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the members of public.87     Notably, unlikeCity Chain\n                        Storeswhere there was a stark disparity in price between the\n                    parties’ watches,ie, $200 and (at least)\n                    $4,000 respectively, there is no such disparity between the Appellant’s\n                    and Respondent’s watches, both of which are marked at around $400. It is\n                    important to recognise that “a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk\n                    will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of\n                    £50,000” (as per Pumfrey J inPicasso v\n                        OHIM, T-104/01 [2002] ECR II-4359). It may be argued\n                    that it is unlikely that the average consumer would freely and whimsically spend\n                    $400 on a watch without much consideration prior to the purchase and that\n                    although the average consumer might do a “double-take” when\n                    looking at “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by virtue of\n                    similarity of marks, at a price of $400, the consumer will exercise some degree\n                    of prudence and pause for a moment to ensure that he is purchasing a watch from\n                    the desired brand.88     Even if there is an association between the\n                    two marks owing to the common “-ESTINA”, this association by\n                    itself, short of a misapprehension of origin of the goods, may not warrant a\n                    finding of likelihood of confusion. Some evidence would need to be adduced to\n                    indicate such an association on account of the advertisements, methods of sale\n                    and/or packaging of the Appellant’s and Respondent’s items or for\n                    any other reason. Otherwise, the risk of confusion is merely hypothetical and\n                    speculative because there is simply no evidence of any such confusion arising on\n                    the part of the consumers; seeCity Chain Storesat [57].89     In this regard, the steps taken by the\n                    Respondent to differentiate its goods from those of the Appellant’s become\n                    pertinent. As Lai Kew Chai J inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v\n                        Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005] 4 SLR(R) 816 at\n                    [21] opined, where the user of a potentially infringing sign had taken pains to\n                    distinguish his products from the registered proprietor’s goods, the\n                    effect might be that the likelihood of confusion, if any, was merely\n                    hypothetical or speculative. The Respondent here submitted that it had taken\n                    steps in differentiating its goods from the Appellant’s given that its\n                    target consumer was wholly different from the Appellant’s. The Respondent\n                    referred to its brand story which projected a dainty image of an Italian\n                    princess and Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet\n                    cat. Accordingly, it was argued that this brand story was likely to draw the\n                    attention and patronage of younger female consumers. In stark contrast, the\n                    Appellant’s goods were advertised in more mature materials thus conveying\n                    an image of maturity and sensuality aimed at older and more established female\n                    consumers.90     Unlike the situation inCity Chain Storeswhere Solvil watches averaging $200 in price\n                    were pitted against Louis Vuitton watches costing at least thousands of dollars,\n                    we have here goods of similar pricing which may be described as low to\n                    medium-range, bearing in mind the standard of living in Singapore. There was no\n                    evidence that the Appellant’s or the Respondent’s watches were sold\n                    in specialty stores (unlike those of Louis Vuitton). We are comparing marks\n                    which bear words and pictures resembling each other and not merely four-petal\n                    stylised flower designs (Louis Vuitton’s flower design inCity Chain Storeswas considered not to be that\n                    well-known standing on its own anyway). We also do not know how the parties will\n                    market or advertise their goods in Singapore as both do not have a presence here\n                    at the moment. With the similarity in the marks and in the goods as discussed\n                    earlier, there is a real likelihood that the consumer may mistake one brand for\n                    the other or believe erroneously that the two are related and have the same\n                    origin or come from economically-linked sources.91     The Respondent’s brand story does not\n                    serve as a differentiating measure as there is no brand story on the\n                    Appellant’s part. In any event, merely having the brand story on its\n                    website is far removed from having it in routine advertisements. Indeed, by\n                    giving a European setting to its brand name, the Respondent (with its origin in\n                    the Far East) increases the likelihood of confusion between FESTINA and\n                    J.ESTINA. I will have more to comment on the brand story later when I deal with\n                    the issue of bad faith.92     In all the circumstances of the case, I am of\n                    the view that the likelihood of confusion is a probability and not a mere\n                    possibility. With respect, the PAR’s opinion on this issue was premised on\n                    her findings from which I have departed materially. Accordingly, the Appellant\n                    is entitled to succeed in its opposition based on s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA.Appeal against PAR’s decision under s 7(6) TMA93     s 7(6) TMA stipulates as follows:Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration7. —(1) …(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith.94     The PAR held at [113] of the GD that the\n                    Respondent’s act of registering “J.ESTINA” was not\n                    sufficient to show that its act fell short of the standard of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade. Thus, the PAR opined that bad faith was not established.95     The Appellant submitted that given the\n                    Appellant’s establishment since 1902 and the successful sales it has in\n                    Hong Kong and Japan, the Respondent was very likely to have been aware of the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA and device”. The Appellant also\n                    took issue with the Respondent’s failure to tender any written submissions\n                    on the issue of bad faith. In particular, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent failed to provide evidence of any “Jovanna Estina” or\n                    even any “Estina family” with ties to royalty (in its brand\n                    story).96     The Appellant citedPolo\n                        Spirit Pte Ltd v S. Tous S.L[2009] SGIPOS 3 for the\n                    proposition that when bad faith is alleged by either party, the party who is\n                    second in time has the onus of explaining how he came about using or registering\n                    the mark. Moreover, the Appellant sought to rely onKundry\n                        SA’s Application: Opposition by the President and Fellows of Harvard\n                        College[1998] ETMR 178, for the proposition that where\n                    the applicant had not rebutted such serious claims of bad faith by way of\n                    counterstatement or evidence, the opposition would be allowed to\n                proceed.97     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that since the two marks were completely different, no issue of bad faith arose\n                    in the present case. In any event, the derivation of the Respondent’s mark\n                    was sufficiently explained in the brand story,ie,\n                    the initial “J” stands for “Jovanna” which is\n                    derived from the name of an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen known as\n                    “Jovanna Elizabeth Antonia Romana Marie” and revolves around\n                    princess Jovanna’s name, her tiara and her pet cat “Jenna”.\n                    The Respondent argued that it never maintained that the Respondent’s mark\n                    was indeed the princess’ name.98     An allegation that a trade mark has been\n                    applied for in bad faith is a serious one. In “Royal\n                        Enfield” Trade Marks[2002] RPC 24 at [31]\n                    (endorsed by the Court of Appeal inFuture\n                        Enterprisesat [78]) it was held that:A plea of fraud should not lightly be made ... and if made should be\n                        distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not permissible to leave\n                        fraud to be inferred from the facts (seeDavy v\n                            Garrett(1877-78) L.R. 7 Ch.D. 473 at 489). … It\n                        should not be made unless it can be fully and properly pleaded and should\n                        not be upheld unless it is distinctly proved and this will rarely be\n                        possible by a process of inference.Notably, this sets a high threshold for an allegation of bad faith to\n                    be met by the Appellant.99     The findings of Geoffrey Hobbs QC inDemon Ale Trade Mark[2000] RPC 345 with\n                    regard to the expression “bad faith” was cited with approval inNautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard and\n                        another[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 (“Nautical\n                    Concept”) at [19]:[There are] moral overtones which appear to make it possible for an\n                        application for registration to be rendered invalid ... by behaviour which\n                        otherwise involves no breach of any duty, obligation, prohibition or\n                        requirement that is legally binding upon the applicant.The logical consequence of this is such that once bad faith is\n                    established, the application to register a trade mark in question will not be\n                    allowed even if the mark does not cause any confusion or breach of\n                duty.What is “bad faith”?100    Bad faith is to be determined as at the date\n                    of application and matters which occurred after the date of application which\n                    may assist in determining the applicant’s state of mind as at the date of\n                    application can be taken into consideration, seeFerrero\n                        SpA’s Trade Marks (Kinder), O/279/03\n                    [2004] RPC (29) 253.101    Lindsay J inGromax\n                        Plasticulture Ltd v Don & Low Nonwovens Ltd[1999] RPC 367 at 379 discussed what the concept of “bad\n                    faith” connotes:I shall not attempt to define bad faith in this context. Plainly it\n                        includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which\n                        fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by\n                        reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined.\n                        Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not\n                        bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short as to amount\n                        to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by\n                        the courts (which leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the\n                        Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a\n                        regard to all material surrounding circumstances.102    AsBently &\n                        Shermanat p 851 observes, the courts have struggled to find a\n                    satisfactory definition of “bad faith” and have ultimately aligned\n                    the definition in trade mark law with that operating in other areas of civil\n                    liability, particularly the so-called “knowing assistance” in\n                    breach of trust, seeHarrison’s Trade Mark\n                        Application[2005] FSR 10\n                    (“Harrison’s”). InHarrison’s, Sir William Aldous discussed the notion of\n                    “bad faith” at [24] and [26]:Clearly the court, when considering bad faith, cannot apply a purely\n                        subjective test, called by Lord Hutton [inTwinsectra Ltd\n                            v Yardley[2002] 2 AC 164] the “Robin Hood\n                        test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards cannot be\n                        permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances where a person\n                        abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The registration of trade mark\n                        is designed to enablebona fideproprietors to\n                        protect their proprietary rights without having to prove unfair trading.\n                        Registration is not provided to help those with low moral standards.…For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord Hutton [in relation to\n                        “dishonesty”] as applying to considerations of bad faith. The\n                        words “bad faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when\n                        considering the question of whether an application to register is made in\n                        bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must\n                        decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to\n                        apply for registration would be regarded as bad faith by persons adopting\n                        proper standards.103    The authors ofBently\n                        & Shermanat p 852 note that instances of “bad\n                    faith” can be placed into three categories:(a)No intention to use the mark;(b)Abuse of a relationship;(c)Where the applicant was aware that a third party\n                            had some sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark.104    The following cases demonstrate the meaning\n                    of bad faith according to the above categorization:(a)   No intention to use the mark105    In the case ofPT\n                        Swakarya Indah Busana v Dhan International Exim Pte Ltd[2010]\n                    2 SLR 109, Lai Siu Chiu J found that after registering the mark\n                    “EMPEROR MARTIN” in 2002, the defendant did not intend to use the\n                    mark. Instead, on the shirts sold by the defendant was the defendant’s\n                    tailored mark (as opposed to the registered mark) which showed the word\n                    “MARTIN” in a much more prominent font than that of\n                    “Emperor”. Lai J found that there was an obvious and\n                    conscious effort on the part of the defendant to copy the plaintiff’s mark\n                    in the usage of the word “MARTIN”. The plaintiff had a total of\n                    six marks registered in Singapore, all of which included the name\n                    “MARTIN”) and there was a deliberate preference to use the\n                    defendant’s tailored mark instead of the defendant’s registered\n                    mark. Thus, the lack ofbona fideintention to use\n                    the mark in the form that was applied to be registered was found to be an act of\n                    bad faith.(b)   Abuse of a relationship106    InNautical\n                        Concept, Tan Lee Meng J found the appellant there to have\n                    acted in bad faith when it sought to register its “JWest” mark. It\n                    was held that in the light of the appellant’s history of dealings with the\n                    respondent and its blatant attempt to take advantage of the respondent’s\n                    trade mark,ie, “Jeffery West” and\n                    “JW” time and time again in the past, its attempt to register the\n                    “JWest” mark was regarded as an unacceptable business tactic\n                    adopted in relation to the respondent’s trade mark. The appellant’s\n                    attempt to explain the derivation of its mark was found to be too far-fetched;\n                    at [26] ofNautical Concept. Tan J agreed\n                    with the PAR’s decision there that the “sheer elaborateness of the\n                    explanations” for the selection of one letter of the mark (the letter\n                    “J”) made it difficult to believe the appellant’s reasons\n                    for choosing the mark “JWest”. This was especially so when there\n                    was a glaring omission on the appellant’s part to mention that its\n                    managing director once distributed shoes under the mark “Jeffery\n                    West” and “JW” for the respondent.107    A finding of bad faith can also be made\n                    where the applicant was aware that someone else intends to use and/or register\n                    the mark, particularly where the applicant has a relationship, for example as\n                    employee or agent, with that other person, or where the applicant has copied a\n                    mark being used abroad with the intention of pre-empting the proprietor who\n                    intends to trade in the specific country, seeDaawat Trade\n                        Mark[2003] RPC 11 at [93]. Similarly, where an\n                    applicant attempts, by means of registration, to seize a trade mark of a third\n                    party with whom he had a contractual or pre-contractual relationship, the\n                    registration would also be found to have been made in bad faith, seeLancome Parfums et Beaute & Cie’s Community Trade Mark\n                        Application[2001] ETMR 89 (“Lancome\n                    Parfums”) at [33].(c)   Where the applicant was aware that a third party had some\n                sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark108    InRothmans of Pall Mall\n                        Ltd v Maycolson International Pte Ltd[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 551 (“Rothmans”),\n                    having regard to the totality of evidence, Lai Siu Chiu J at [36] to [41]\n                    found that various instances of bad faith could be inferred in that case. For\n                    instance, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incorporation of the\n                    respondent company suggested that it was merely a “shell company”\n                    used by the Hertlein brothers to propagate the use of the\n                    “Fairlight” mark in relation to cigarettes. Moreover, despite a\n                    Europe-wide injunction which at that time prevented the Hertlein brothers from\n                    using the “Fairlight” mark and packaging, they have repeatedly\n                    shown their improper motives to capitalise on the appellant's reputation and\n                    goodwill by their attempt to sidestep the terms of the injunction, as well as by\n                    their persistence in associating themselves with the proprietor's trade marks.\n                    Such an association with the appellants can be seen from the Hertlein\n                    brothers’ lack of candour when explaining their advertising strategies\n                    which blatantly claimed that \"Fairlight\" cigarettes were similar in taste and\n                    packaging to the appellant’s \"Rothmans\" cigarettes or that\n                    “Fairlight” cigarettes resembled the appellant’s \"Rothmans\"\n                    cigarettes.109    Other illustrations of bad faith can be also\n                    be seen inInterkrenn Maschinen Vertriebs GmbH’s\n                        Community Trade Mark[2002] ETMR 27 whereby the\n                    applicant conclusively showed that there was a person who was linked to the\n                    trade mark proprietor and who had obtained knowledge of a planned trade mark of\n                    the applicant during a business meeting. This scenario was dubbed as a classic\n                    case of “trade mark theft”.110    During the course of submissions, parties\n                    were invited to address the court on whether “bad faith” was a\n                    stand-alone, distinct ground of opposition which was independent of attending\n                    confusion or whether a “twin-approach” should be taken (in the\n                    sense that bad faith can be relied upon in order to tilt the balance in deciding\n                    whether there was confusion between the two marks).111    The Appellant submitted that there has to beat leastsome similarity between the two marks\n                    before bad faith can be established, thus alluding to a case of\n                    “copying” of the proprietor’s mark. Alternatively, the\n                    Appellant reiterated Lai J’s decision inRothmansin which it was held at [29] thatdespite the fact that the marks in question are not so similar as to cause\n                        confusion, bad faith can still be established on the\n                    facts.112    As for the Respondent, it maintained that\n                    nothing short of a “distinct proof of unacceptable commercial\n                    behaviour” should warrant a finding of bad faith. This position, however,\n                    seems to be a rather abstract postulation of what the court should do in\n                    determining whether bad faith arose on the facts.113    From the case law discussed above, it\n                    appears that bad faith encompasses “underhand practice involving absence\n                    of good faith on the part of the [trade mark applicant]” (in the words ofLancome Parfumsat [33]. As bad faith is an\n                    “absolute ground for refusal”, this suggests that it is an\n                    independent and distinct ground for refusing the registration of marks in its\n                    own right. As noted by Lai J inRothmans,\n                    this view is consonant with Tan Tee Jim SC’s observations inLaw of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell Asia, 2ndEd, 2005) at paragraph\n                    5.71:Once bad faith is established, the application will be refused, even\n                        though the offending conduct does not cause any confusion or breach any\n                        duty, obligation, prohibition or other legally binding requirement.114    However, the numerous attempts in drawing\n                    the parameters of “bad faith” by various courts are vivid\n                    illustrations of the inherently abstract nature of this concept. The concept of\n                    bad faith is extremely wide in the sense that the courts can infer instances of\n                    bad faith and decide according to the justice of individual cases. Naturally,\n                    the court should also be cautious in not over-extending this concept lest it\n                    becomes a weapon of terror against competitors of trade mark\n                proprietors.115    The categorization byBently & Shermanas seen above hints that despite the broad\n                    nature of the notion of bad faith, one must showsome sort of\n                        nexusbetween the parties in dispute. Otherwise, the notion of\n                    bad faith would have to be decided in vacuum. A clear-cut example of such a\n                    nexus would be an outright copying of the proprietor’s mark such that the\n                    two competing marks are practically identical. However, the nexus may be in the\n                    guise of something more subtle. In finding a nexus between the parties, a\n                    parallel may be drawn between ss 8(2)(b) and\n                    s 7(6) TMA. For example, there may be cases where although there issomesimilarity of marks or of the goods or\n                    services, it falls short of confusing similarity (ie, no likelihood of confusion) within the meaning of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. Nevertheless, the evidence\n                    of this similarity may be taken into account and considered against the\n                    background facts from which bad faith may be inferred. In other words, while the\n                    finding of bad faith is largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial\n                    evidence, the party alleging bad faith needs to show some link between the\n                    parties, perhaps by way of a pre-existing relationship or some acts of\n                    association with the proprietor or some nexus between the two competing\n                    marks.116    There may be a fine line between being\n                    inspired by another’s trade mark as opposed to blatant copying or copying\n                    with some modifications made to the mark. The former would not attract punitive\n                    measures whereas the latter would lead to the mark being rejected. Where the\n                    dividing line between “inspiration” and\n                    “infringement” should be drawn is a matter best left to the facts\n                    peculiar to any case.Was the Respondent’s registration of “J.ESTINA”\n                made in bad faith?117    The Appellant argued that the lack of\n                    response from the Respondent against the claim of bad faith was far from\n                    satisfactory. Even if the Respondent’s brand story was taken as some sort\n                    of explanation of the derivation of the brand name, it was argued that the brand\n                    story was incapable of holding up against scrutiny. Thus, the only inference was\n                    that the Respondent’s mark was a product of copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark.118    As this was not the first time the parties\n                    have been embroiled in litigation, the Appellant sought to draw the\n                    court’s attention to previous instances of litigation between the\n                    parties:(a)An opposition in South Korea Opposition No.\n                            40-2006-000245 in relation to the Respondent’s other mark\n                            “Estina Donna & Device” which was successfully opposed\n                            by the Appellant;(b)An opposition in relation to Korean Trade Mark\n                            Application No. 2002-0046412 for “J.ESTINA” in respect of\n                            Class 14 which was dismissed as the marks were found to be\n                            dissimilar and no likelihood of confusion was held to\n                        exist;(c)A decision by the Office for Harmonisation in the\n                            Internal Market (“OHIM”) in respect of Opposition No.\n                            B765356 issued on 26 April 2006 in favour of Appellant. The Respondent\n                            submitted that the OHIM had issued its decision based on evidence before\n                            it without having considered any submissions or representations by the\n                            Respondent as it had, for purely commercial reasons, not filed any\n                            observation or response to the Appellant’s opposition. The\n                            Respondent was there seeking to use the mark “JOVANNA\n                            ESTINA” instead of “J.ESTINA” in\n                        Europe;(d)A censure issued by the Arbitration Panel at\n                            Baselworld (Watch and Jewellery Show) on 2 April 2006 which prohibited\n                            the Respondent from using “J.ESTINA” in relation to, among\n                            other things, jewellery, precious stones, horological and chronometric\n                            instruments for the duration of the show. The Respondent submitted that\n                            the Arbitration Panel was an unofficial adjudicating body having no\n                            juridical authority over the parties and its decision should have no\n                            bearing upon the court’s decision here. Further, as the trade show\n                            was for a short duration only, it was simply not expedient to contest\n                            the Appellant’s allegations.As the PAR rightly observed, litigation between the parties in other\n                    jurisdictions serves at best as guides to opposition proceedings here. The\n                    relevance of these decisions will hinge upon the similarity of the laws of the\n                    particular jurisdiction with those of Singapore and also upon the individual\n                    facts of the case, at [118] of GD.119    The Appellant also pointed out that the\n                    Respondent had sought to register the mark “Jovanna Estina” in\n                    Singapore on 20 June 2008 in Trade Mark No. T 0808240Z, in respect of\n                    Class 14 goods. This date fell between the date of notice of opposition\n                    filed by the Appellant (22 September 2006) and the date the GD was rendered\n                    (8 February 2009). The fact that the Respondent thought it necessary to\n                    register an alternative mark in respect of the identical class of goods between\n                    those dates could not be coincidental. The Appellant, by way of Mr. Javier\n                    Ribas’ statutory declaration, submitted that the Respondent’s action\n                    was an indication that it was not confident that it would be able to avoid being\n                    held to be in infringement of the Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”\n                    by its use of “J.ESTINA”.120    In Mr. Myoung-chul Shin’s\n                    statutory declaration, it was said that a commissioned group was set up in order\n                    to come up with a brand name for their jewellery/watch line. A total of 14\n                    European-sounding names were suggested and considered and by process of\n                    elimination, “J.ESTINA” was chosen. A Report on Result of Naming\n                    Research for New Business was made on 1 October 2002 in which\n                    “J.ESTINA” was finally selected, accompanied by a note stating\n                    that “a crown device may be added”. The letter “J”\n                    in “J.ESTINA” was said to have derived from\n                    “Jovanna” who was an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. This\n                    brand story appears on the Respondent’s website which shows a princess, a\n                    tiara, and her pet car “Jenna”.121    A graphic presentation (in the form of a\n                    mind map) of the various names that were considered, amongst them being\n                    “J.ESTINA”, was also adduced as evidence in the Bundle of\n                    Documents, Volume II Part B. The graphic presentation showed the various factors\n                    that were taken into account in the process of naming,ie, originality, luxury, royal family, targeting consumers\n                    between 25 and 35 years of age. The graphic presentation also showed that the\n                    brand slogan was “Modern Renaissance” and the brand concept was\n                    one of “European Modern Jewellery”. Three graphs were similarly\n                    adduced to show the process of elimination of the other shortlisted13 names and\n                    also the degree of registrability of the final five names.122    In my opinion, the Respondent’s brand\n                    story on the name “J.ESTINA” appears extremely contrived. Firstly,\n                    the use of Princess Jovanna’s name (compressed to “J.”) only\n                    explains the use of the letter “J”. It does not explain why the\n                    meaningless word “ESTINA” was chosen. The six letters in\n                    “ESTINA” are not even the initials of “Jovanna Elizabeth\n                    Antonia Romana Marie” nor do they have any nexus with the tiara or the\n                    pet cat “Jenna” which were repeatedly referred to whenever the\n                    question of derivation of the brand name was raised. The brand story certainly\n                    does not answer any of the queries regarding the derivation of\n                    “ESTINA”. As mentioned at[90]above, giving a European setting to the story merely reinforces the association\n                    between the two competing marks.123    The graphs which supposedly illustrate the\n                    process of ultimately choosing the name “J.ESTINA” also do not\n                    explain in any way how the word “ESTINA” came into being. As the\n                    Respondent has conceded, “ESTINA” is an invented word with no\n                    meaning. The failure to furnish the court with a credible explanation of how\n                    “ESTINA” in the brand name “J.ESTINA” was derived,\n                    where the explanation is particularly pertinent since 6 out of 7 letters are in\n                    identical sequence in the two competing marks, can only lead to the irresistible\n                    conclusion that the word “ESTINA” was blatantly copied from the\n                    Appellant by a “cut and paste” job. The adding of\n                    “J” with a dot just before “ESTINA” makes little\n                    difference to the final name as both words in the competing marks (including the\n                    Appellant’s other marks) would still look alike and sound remarkably\n                    similar whether “J.ESTINA” is pronounced\n                    “jay-estina” (with the “jay” sound likely to be\n                    slurred) or “jes-tina”. Such outright copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark is an act that falls short of the acceptable commercial\n                    behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade.124    In these circumstances, the\n                    Respondent’s registration of T05/25465Z was undoubtedly made in bad faith.\n                    I therefore have to disagree with the PAR on this issue as well and allow the\n                    Appellant’s objection based on s 7(6) TMA. The Respondent’s\n                    application to register its mark should accordingly be refused.Conclusion125    For the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Appellant’s appeal is allowed on the basis of its opposition based on\n                    s 7(6) and s 8(2)(b) TMA.126    The Respondent is to pay the Appellant the\n                    costs of this appeal which are to be taxed or agreed.127    I thank counsel for both parties for their\n                    written and oral submissions which were of great assistance to me.",
        "PAR’s findings with respect to s 7(6) TMA": "11     Section 7(6) TMA stipulates: Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration 7. — (1) ... (6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith. The PAR found that the evidence tendered before her did not show that\n                    the Respondent’s actions fell short of the standards of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    area of trade, at [113] of GD. Thus, the Appellant’s opposition under bad\n                    faith failed.",
        "The Appellant’s submissions on appeal": "12     The Appellant submitted that there are visual,\n                    aural and conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark. 13     The Appellant’s approach during the\n                    course of submissions was a strategic one. It first sought to demonstrate that\n                    the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25,ie,\n                    those which the Appellant’s various trade marks were registered under,\n                    could be broadly and rationally categorised as “fashion\n                    accessories”. Flowing from this logic, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent’s goods in Class 14 wereat\n                        leastsimilar to the Appellant’s goods in respect of\n                    Classes 9, 14, 18 and 25 as they were all “fashion\n                    accessories”. The implication of such, as submitted by the Appellant, was\n                    that the relevant “earlier mark” for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA included not only the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 (as held by the PAR) but also the Appellant’s\n                    other marks. This was crucial to strengthening the Appellant’s case as the\n                    Appellant’s other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) bore\n                    greater visual similarity to the Respondent’s mark, a point conceded by\n                    the Respondent. 14     Applying the global appreciation test, the\n                    Appellant took the position that a likelihood of confusion existed on the part\n                    of the public between the Respondent’s mark and the Appellant’s mark\n                    1 (and the Appellant’s other marks if the Court accepts the\n                    Appellant’s submission above) within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA. 15     For the claim of bad faith under s 7(6)\n                    TMA, the Appellant submitted that the PAR erred in finding that there was no bad\n                    faith on the Respondent’s part. The Appellant submitted that Respondent\n                    was very likely to have been aware of the Appellant’s mark and its\n                    reputation. This, compounded by the Respondent’s failure to respond by way\n                    of counterstatement to the allegation of bad faith and the unsatisfactory\n                    explanation given by the Respondent regarding the derivation of the brand name\n                    “J.ESTINA” suggested that the Respondent must have copied the\n                    Appellant’s mark. Thus, the application to register the Respondent’s\n                    mark in such circumstances must have been made in bad faith.",
        "The Respondent’s submissions on appeal": "16     The Respondent took the view that the\n                    Appellant’s appeal against the PAR’s findings in respect of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA was misconceived. Faced\n                    with the Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9,\n                    14, 18 and 25 as being similar in nature which would entitle the court to\n                    consider the Appellant’s other marks, the Respondent submitted that there\n                    was no overlap between the specification of goods for the Appellant’s\n                    marks in Classes 9, 18 and 25 with that of the Respondent’s\n                    Class 14 goods. Hence, the Respondent maintained that the relevant\n                    “earlier mark” that the court was entitled to consider was\n                    confined to the Appellant’s mark 1 for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. 17     The Respondent also submitted that there were\n                    no visual, aural or conceptual similarities between the Appellant’s and\n                    Respondent’s marks and that there was no likelihood of confusion between\n                    the two marks. 18     Given its stance that the two marks were\n                    completely different, the Respondent submitted that there was no issue of bad\n                    faith that needed to be addressed. As the Appellant had provided no distinct\n                    proof of unacceptable commercial behaviour, its claim against the Respondent in\n                    respect of bad faith under s 7(6) TMA must necessarily fail.",

        "Appeal against the PAR’s decision under s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA": "22     The text of s 8(2)(b) TMA has been set out at[9]above. 23     As enumerated by Woo Bih Li J\n                    (“Woo J”) inOzone Community Corp v Advance\n                        Magazine Publishers Inc[2010] SGHC 16\n                        (“Ozone Community Corp”) at\n                    [36], there are three conditions under s 8(2)(b) TMA which the Appellant has to satisfy in order to succeed in\n                    its opposition to the Respondent’s application: (a)The Appellant’s mark 1 “FESTINA and\n                            device” and the Respondent’s mark “J.ESTINA and\n                            device” are similar (“Condition 1”);(b)If Condition 1 is satisfied, then that the\n                            Respondent’s mark “J.ESTINA and device” is to be\n                            registered for goods identical with or similar to those for which the\n                            Appellant’s mark 1 “FESTINA and device” is protected\n                            (“Condition 2”);(c)If Conditions 1 and 2 are both satisfied, then\n                            there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by\n                            virtue of the similarity of the marks and of the goods\n                            (“Condition 3”).24     Notably, these conditions are cumulative in\n                    the sense that all three conditions must be satisfied before\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA can be successfully relied\n                    on. The need for a conjunctive reading of these three conditions was also\n                    emphasised by the Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v\n                        Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR(R) 690\n                    (“The Polo/Lauren Co”) at [8] albeit in the context of the trade\n                    marks infringement provision,ie,\n                        s 27(2)(b) TMA, the wording of which\n                    mirrors that of s 8(2)(b) TMA:While we can see some link and overlap between the first and the third\n                        conditions, it is clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is\n                        similar to a registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be\n                        a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                        fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                        circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter of\n                        degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between a mark\n                        and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not\n                            satisfied there will not be any need to go into the third question of\n                            determining whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does\n                            it mean that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on\n                            similar goods, that there willipso factobe confusion in the minds of the public. If that was\n                        intended, s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                        phrased differently. As presently worded,there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are\n                            present. …[emphasis added]Condition 1: Similarity of marks25     The Respondent’s mark and the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 are both composite marks which consist of a pictorial\n                    element and a word element. The two marks are as follow:Respondent’s markAppellant’s mark 1The decided cases suggest that there are three aspects to similarity:\n                    visual, aural and conceptual. Whether there is a similarity of marks in these\n                    three aspects is essentially a question of fact, seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1082 at [9].26     As noted in[10]above, the PAR found that these two marks were aurally\n                    similar but were not visually and conceptually similar.(1)   Visual Similarity27     The Appellant submitted that the PAR had erred\n                    in concluding that the two marks were visually dissimilar. It was accepted that\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 was a composite mark consisting of a crest device\n                    with the word “FESTINA” emblazoned across the curved banner below\n                    the pictorial element.28     The PAR at [57] and [58] of the GD made a\n                    comparison between the two marks and found:(a)In relation to the Respondent’s mark,\n                            “J.ESTINA” was a dominant component as the word\n                            “J.ESTINA” constituted half or more of the\n                            Respondent’s mark. As for the crown device, it was much smaller in\n                            size in relation to the word “J.ESTINA”.(b)As for the Appellant’s mark 1, the crest\n                            formed the dominant component while the word “FESTINA” was\n                            subsumed within the curved banner of the crest. It was opined that\n                            crests were normally intricately designed with complicated elements such\n                            that, generally, consumers would not be able to recall their exact\n                            details save for the impression that the crest was part of the\n                            mark.29     It was the Appellant’s submission that\n                    crests and coats-of-arms are nowadays commonly used on a wide variety of goods\n                    ranging from watches, foodstuffs and beverages. It was said that the\n                    consumers’ eyes are usually drawn to the words in such a mark in order to\n                    ascertain the origin of the goods. In other words, even where a crest forms a\n                    dominant part of the trade mark, it will have a “negligible\n                    effect” when the average consumer recalls the trade mark. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 would be remembered and accordingly be described as\n                    “FESTINA” (ie, word element) since\n                    the crest element (ie, pictorial element) cannot\n                    be verbalized. This, combined with the imperfect recollection of an average\n                    consumer, in terms of visual recognition, is likely to militate against\n                    distinguishing between the two marks “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.30     The European Court of Justice\n                    (“ECJ”) has emphasised that the assessment of similarity between\n                    two marks must be based on the overall impression created by them, in\n                    particular, of their distinctive and dominant components, seeSabel BV v Puma AG, Rudolf Dassler Sport, Case C-251/95\n                    [1997] ECR I- 6191 andLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v\n                        Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343.\n                    Thus, in deciding whether there are visual similarities between the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark, I agree with the PAR\n                    that with respect to the Respondent’s mark, the word\n                    “J.ESTINA” formed the dominant part of the mark whereas for the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1, the crest was the dominant aspect f. To this extent,\n                    there is no visual similarity between the two marks.31     The Appellant submitted that there are\n                    instances whereby the overall impression conveyed to the relevant public by a\n                    composite mark may be dominated by one or more of its components, seeMatratzen Concord GmbH v OHIM, Case T- 6/01\n                    [2002] ECR II-4335 at [32].Medion AG v Thomson\n                        Multimedia Sales Germany & Austria GmbH, Case C- 120/04\n                    [2005] ECR I-8551 (“Medion”) was also cited by the\n                    Appellant as authority that it is still possible that a non-dominant component\n                    of a composite mark might have an independent distinctive role in the composite\n                    mark, see [30] ofMedion. Thus, the\n                    Appellant’s position was that even if “FESTINA” was not the\n                    dominant element of the Appellant’s mark 1, its distinctive role would\n                    support its contention that the two marks were in fact visually\n                similar.32     The Appellant’s reliance onMedionshould be read in context in order to fully\n                    appreciate the reasoning behind the decision of the ECJ. The ECJ envisaged that\n                    notwithstanding that the overall impression of the average consumer may be\n                    dominated by one or more components of a composite mark, there might be\n                    instances whereby anon-dominant elementof a\n                    composite mark would nevertheless be so distinctive (viz, by virtue of its widely-known commercial name) such that\n                    the public may be led to believe that the goods or services at issue were\n                    derived from economically linked companies, in which case the “likelihood\n                    of confusion” must be held to be established, see [31] and [32] ofMedion.33     As seen above, the driving force behind the\n                    ECJ’s reasoning that there existed a “likelihood of\n                    confusion” between the two marks was because thenon-dominant but distinctive elementof the composite mark was\n                    one that wasin itselfalready widely-known, see\n                    [34] ofMedion. Thus, it is pertinent to note thatMediondoes not purport to confer upon\n                    otherwise dissimilar marks a greater degree of visual similarity by virtue of\n                    some distinctiveness in the earlier mark.34     Thus, even if one considers the word\n                    “FESTINA” to be non-dominant but distinctive, it is not sufficient\n                    in and by itself to establish that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are thereby visually similar. I therefore accept that\n                    there is no visual similarity between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.(2)   Conceptual Similarity35     The PAR at [63] of the GD noted that the\n                    addition of crest-like designs (eg, that of the\n                    Appellant’s mark 1) had over time been considered to be a design element\n                    which lends a “high-class” look to a mark. However, she opined\n                    that the same could not be said of a crown device (eg, that of Respondent’s mark) since it continues to this\n                    day to connote and evoke the idea of royal patronage. Thus, it was held that the\n                    two marks were conceptually dissimilar.36     The Appellant submitted that the proper\n                    comparison between the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark\n                    in the assessment of conceptual similarity should be that the two marks were of\n                    a combination of a “foreign sort of name” and a device which hints\n                    at royalty. On this premise, the Appellant submitted that there was conceptual\n                    similarity between the two marks. Alternatively, the Appellant submitted that\n                    the crest and crown devices were conceptually neutral.37     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the Appellant’s mark 1 and the Respondent’s mark were\n                    conceptually dissimilar as the crest device and the crown device conveyed\n                    different ideas. For instance, a crown device would convey an impression of\n                    royalty whereas a crest device,eg, crest of\n                    Singapore, would not.38     Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press,\n                        3rdEd, 2009) (“Bently\n                        & Sherman”) noted at p 866 that in relation to\n                    “conceptual similarity”:Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of theideas that lie behind or inform\n                            the earlier mark. [emphasis added]39     A clear case of conceptual dissimilarity can\n                    be seen inPhillips – Van Heusen, T–\n                    292/01 [2003] ECR II – 4335 where “BASS” was found\n                    to be conceptually dissimilar to “PASH” as the former was\n                    understood as a musical reference whereas the latter either had no meaning or\n                    referred to German dice.40Itochu Corporation v\n                        Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9\n                    (“Itochu”) offers a more nuanced illustration of conceptual\n                    similarity. InItochu, the PAR (and subsequently\n                    the High Court) held that the marks “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” were conceptually dissimilar: the\n                    “CAMEL” mark evoked a sense of “ruggedness, adventure and\n                    masculinity” whereas the applicant’s mark\n                    “SWEETCAMEL” which was preceded by the adjective\n                    “SWEET” projected a totally opposite impression.41     In the case ofOzone\n                        Community Corp, the two marks in issue were\n                    “GLAMOUR” and “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”. The PAR found that\n                    both marks were in some way conceptually similar as both marks used the\n                    “glamour” concept, despite one appealing to the orthodox meaning\n                    while the other giving the concept a spin without completely altering its\n                    texture. This finding was upheld by the High Court at [64].42     In the case ofImperial\n                        Tobacco Co (of Great Britain and Ireland) Ltd’s Trade Marks[1915] 2 Ch 27 (“Imperial Tobacco”), albeit decided in the context\n                    of whether the use of Prince of Wales plumes (part of the Prince of Wales\n                    heraldic achievements) which formed part of the proprietor’s trade mark\n                    amounted to an act of “calculative deception”, Lord Cozens- Hardy\n                    MR noted that the Prince of Wales feathers had for many years to a very great\n                    extent been used by traders of every kind in such a way that the mere use of\n                    them did not by itself indicate to anybody with a rational mind that the person\n                    so using it was a warrant holder. Concurring with Lord Cozens-Hardy MR, Pickford\n                    LJ further observed that:I have no doubt whatever that many kinds of articles are at the present\n                        moment described by the names of persons distinguished in the war, butno one imagines that that practice means anything\n                            more than giving those articles an attractive name, and I\n                        cannot imagine there is anything more than that in using the name of the\n                        Prince of Wales.[emphasis added]Notably, this passage buttresses the PAR’s finding at [63] of\n                    the GD that the use of a crest, in the modern context, is used to lend a\n                    “high-class” look to a mark design as an attraction to the average\n                    consumer as opposed to signifying royal patronage.43     The PAR further opined that the crown device\n                    connotes and evokes the idea of royal patronage. It is probable that the crown\n                    device would evoke a sense of royalty, which is in line with the\n                    Respondent’s brand story of an Italian princess who later became a\n                    Bulgarian queen. However, a crown device in modern usage does not signify only\n                    royal patronage. Borrowing the example of Eve J inImperial Tobacco, I do not think that an average consumer would\n                    be disappointed in finding out that the smoking mixture she purchased was not\n                    supplied for the personal use of the Prince of Wales. In the same vein, nor\n                    would the consumer be disappointed if she discovers that the watch she purchased\n                    was not used by an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. The crown device, in\n                    the modern day, is more likely to evoke a sense of royalty or class and status\n                    rather than royal patronage.44     The PAR at [63] of the GD appeared to have\n                    emphasized solely on the conceptual (dis)similarity between the crown and crest\n                    devices as the invented words were conceptually neutral. I accept the\n                    Appellant’s submission that as the Appellant’s mark 1 and the\n                    Respondent’s mark are composite marks, they should be viewed as a whole.\n                    Thus, the pictorial element as well as the word element should be taken into\n                    account while assessing the conceptual similarities between the marks. The\n                    Appellant’s alternative submission that the crown and crest concepts are\n                    neutral has to be rejected as both do evokesomequalities.45     In my view, insofar as the two marks comprise\n                    an invented word, in that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA”\n                    are not English terms found in dictionaries, and that both employ a pictorial\n                    element that hints at “class” and “status”, there\n                    aresomeconceptual similarities between the two\n                    marks, as opposed to complete or significant similarities, bearing in mind that\n                    the crest and crown devices evoke a sense of class but only the crown device\n                    evokes a sense of royalty.(3)   Aural Similarity46     The PAR at [61] of the GD found that there\n                    were aural similarities between the Appellant’s mark\n                    “FESTINA” and the Respondent’s mark “J.ESTINA”\n                    given that there is little difference between the sounds which the letters\n                    “F” and “J” make at the beginning of the words such\n                    that the pronunciation would largely focus on “ESTINA”. The PAR\n                    also found that while the Respondent’s mark was in the form of\n                    “J.ESTINA”, it was likely that the average consumer would\n                    pronounce it as “jes-tina”.47     At the PAR hearing below and on appeal, the\n                    Respondent sought to differentiate between “FESTINA” (pronounced\n                    as “fes-tina”) and “J.ESTINA” (pronounced as\n                    “jay-estina”) because the former comprises three syllables as\n                    opposed to the latter’s four syllables. The Respondent also submitted that\n                    Sargant LJ’s observation inLondon Lubricants (1920)\n                        Limited’s Application to Register a Trade Mark[1925]\n                    42 RPC 264 at 279 was instructive:[That] the tendency of persons using the English language to slur the\n                        termination of words also has the effect necessarily that the beginning of\n                        words is accentuated in comparison, and… the first syllable of a word\n                        is, as a rule, far [sic] the most important\n                        for the purpose of distinction.This observation, useful as it is, should not be taken as a hard and\n                    fast rule of pronunciation in the English language. The Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] rightly held that\n                    there is no rigid principle that the first syllable of a word mark is more\n                    important than other syllables.48     InMystery Drinks Gmbh v\n                        OHIM, T 99/01 [2004] ETMR (18) 217 (“Mystery\n                    Drinks”), the applicant argued that the two words “MIXERY”\n                    and “MYSTERY” were aurally different as the “i” in\n                    “MIXERY” was shorter and clearer than the “y” in\n                    “MYSTERY” and the “x” in “MIXERY” was\n                    pronounced differently from the “st” of “MYSTERY”.\n                    The European Court of First Instance (“CFI”) rejected this\n                    argument as such aural differences (as submitted by the applicant) could only be\n                    detected if one carried out a fragmented analysis, syllable by syllable, and\n                    completely omitted the comparison of the pronunciation of the words as a whole.\n                    In a similar fashion, the Respondent’s distinction of the number of\n                    syllables of the “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by\n                    dissecting the respective words and then analysing them at a micro-level\n                    overlooks the bigger picture that words are pronounced as a whole.49     In any event, it is more likely than not that\n                    the average consumer when pronouncing the words “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA” (whether pronounced as “Jes-ti-na” or\n                    “Jay-es-ti-na”) would stress “-estina”. The\n                    beginning letters of the words,ie,\n                    “F” and “J”, are consonants which would probably be\n                    given less emphasis. Thus, I agree with the PAR’s finding that there are\n                    aural similarities between “FESTINA” and\n                    “J.ESTINA”.(4)   Overall similarity between the two marks50     As seen above, the Appellant’s mark 1\n                    and the Respondent’s mark are visually dissimilar but conceptually and\n                    aurally similar.51     The law does not require all three\n                    similarities to be established before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediacorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia\n                        Networks plc[2009] 4 SLR(R) 496 (“Mediacorp”) at [32]). As noted inBently & Shermanat pp 863-864:Typically, tribunals consider [visual, aural and conceptual similarities]\n                        in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they have\n                        observed that atrade-offcan occur: visual\n                        and conceptual differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities.[emphasis added]52     Hence, the relative importance of each type of\n                    similarity would vary with the circumstances of each case, in particular the\n                    type of goods and the type of mark. The case ofMystery\n                        Drinksserves as a useful illustration on this point. There, the\n                    CFI at [225] held that:Since the goods in question are also consumedafter\n                            being ordered orally, theaural similarity\n                            of the signs in question is in itself sufficient to give rise to\n                            likelihood of confusion. [emphasis added]53     There is much wisdom in the\n                    “trade-off” approach as it accords a degree of flexibility and\n                    latitude to the courts in coming to a conclusion (with regard to the overall\n                    similarity of marks) against a contextual background by adapting to the ever\n                    evolving commercial reality. For instance, it recognises that in this modern\n                    age, one is able to purchase a timepiece over the Internet, as opposed to the\n                    more conventional trade channels such as departmental stores or specialised\n                    boutiques. It is not denied that an average consumer would rely on his own\n                    visual recognition of a trade mark to differentiate among the various brands for\n                    timepieces. However, this visual recognition is often accompanied by the\n                    “verbalisation” of the mark,iethe\n                    name of the mark. The significance of the verbalisation will, in turn, depend on\n                    the particular mode of purchase of the consumer.54Shaker de L. Laudato &\n                        C. Sas v Limiñana y Botella, SL, Case C-334/05P\n                        (“Shaker”) highlights the\n                    significance of “verbalization” of a mark. InShaker, the applicant sought to register a composite mark for\n                    alcoholic beverages which included the word “LIMONCELLO” above an\n                    image of a plate decorated with six lemons. This was opposed by the owner of a\n                    Spanish word mark “LIMONCHELO” with respect to goods in\n                    Class 33. The CFI held that the signs were dissimilar because of the\n                    dominance of the dish feature in the applicant’s mark which was absent in\n                    the opponent’s mark. The authors ofBently &\n                        Shermancommented at p 864 that “this finding was itself\n                    surprising,given the general tendency to emphasize verbal\n                        components”. The ECJ overturned the CFI’s finding\n                    and reiterated that the assessment was a global one and should not be conducted\n                    by comparing only one element.(A)   Applying the significance of verbalizing a mark to the\n                context of purchase of a watch55     By way of an example, if a consumer chooses to\n                    purchase a “FESTINA” timepiece online, he could either buy it from\n                    a “FESTINA”e-store (assuming there is one) or from a website\n                    which hosts a variety of brands. In the former situation, the name or word\n                    element “FESTINA” has to be typed into the address bar or search\n                    engine for the consumer to be brought to the desired website. In the latter\n                    situation, the name or word element “FESTINA” will be found in a\n                    list of brand names on the relevant website. In both instances, one needs to\n                    recall the word element, “FESTINA”, as opposed to the crest\n                    element of the trade mark. Hence, the visual impact of the mark,ie, the crest, will be less significant as compared to\n                    the aural and visual impact of the word “FESTINA” despite the\n                    crest element being the dominant component of the mark.56     In a situation where a consumer chooses to buy\n                    a “FESTINA” timepiece from a shop, the visual recognition of the\n                    crest device in the trade mark may be of greater significance. Nevertheless,\n                    there is still a need to verbalize the word “FESTINA”. An average\n                    consumer usually identifies a trade mark by virtue of its pictorial element (if\n                    any)andits name/ word element. Even where the\n                    pictorial device forms the dominant element of a trade mark, it would be\n                    extremely rare for a consumer to describe the product by its pictorial element\n                    because the description of, say, the crest, is a much more difficult task, given\n                    its intricacy, as compared to the relatively easy articulation of the word\n                    element/ brand name. Thus, the aural similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    mark 1 and the Respondent mark would militate against the visual dissimilarity\n                    in this instance.(B)   Distinctiveness in the earlier mark57     The issue of distinctiveness of the earlier\n                    mark “FESTINA and device” was not discussed in the GD in the\n                    assessment of similarity of marks. Likewise, parties on appeal did not submit on\n                    the point of distinctiveness. Woo J has observed inOzone Community Corpat [67] that the distinctiveness of the\n                    earlier mark, either inherent or acquired, is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.58     Registrationper\n                        seis inconclusive as to the distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                        (The Polo/Lauren Coat [72]). Chao Hick Tin JA\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [23] also said:We recognise that some marks areinherently\n                            distinctivebecause they consist ofinventive words without any notional or allusive quality. An\n                        example would be \"Volvo\".[emphasis added]Given that “FESTINA” is an invented word, it possesses\n                    inherent distinctiveness and such distinctive quality would be taken into\n                    account in the overall assessment of similarity between the marks.59Bently &\n                        Shermanoffers some useful observation on the interplay between\n                    the distinctiveness of an earlier mark and the similarity of marks at pp 866-867\n                    (footnotes omitted):Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effects.First, the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the less literal or\n                        visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later mark is not similar.\n                        … InReed Executive plc v Reed Business\n                            Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ\n                        stated that ‘where a mark is descriptive [as opposed to distinctive]\n                        small differences may suffice to avoid confusion’… Where the\n                        distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will\n                        have to be in close proximity for it to be similar. …Second,if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then\n                            a mark that has been substantially modified might nonetheless be\n                            similar. …[emphasis added]60     As “FESTINA” is an invented word\n                    with inherent distinctiveness, a modification ofat\n                        leasta substantial degree has to be done for the\n                    Respondent’s mark to be found to be dissimilar to it. A comparison of the\n                    two composite marks shows that:(a)A crown device can be seen in both\n                        marks;(b)The Appellant’s crest device is not present\n                            in the Respondent’s mark;(c)Six out of seven letters in the Appellant’s\n                            word element of its composite mark,ie,\n                            “ESTINA”, are found in the Respondent’s\n                        mark;(d)The first letter “F” in the\n                            Appellant’s word element in its composite mark is replaced by a\n                            “J” and “.” in the Respondent’s\n                            mark.The word element of the Respondent’s mark\n                    “J.ESTINA” does not seem to be very dissimilar from the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”. It is likely that the imperfect\n                    recollection of a consumer who rarely has the opportunity to juxtapose the two\n                    marks and make a comparison may think the marks are similar, seeLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case\n                    C-342/97 [1999] 2 CMLR 1343, 1358-1359.61     Given that there is significant aural\n                    similarity between “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” and\n                    taking into account the inherent distinctiveness of the earlier mark\n                    “FESTINA”, I conclude that there is similarity between the two\n                    marks within the meaning of s 8(2)(b)\n                    TMA.Condition 2: Similarity of goods62     As noted inBently &\n                        Shermanat p 869, “the question of whether goods or\n                    services are similar depends on the facts of the case”. The goods which\n                    the Respondent’s application relates to are “wrist watches,\n                    electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches”. On the other hand, the goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s mark 1 (ie, Class 14\n                    goods) was registered include “watches, clocks and other chronometric\n                    instruments”.63     The PAR found that there was identity between\n                    “wrist watches, electric watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and\n                    “watches, clocks and other chronometric instruments”, see [71] of\n                    GD. As for the remaining goods of the Respondent’s application,ie, “necklaces, rings, bracelets, earrings,\n                    medals and brooches”, the PAR found that there was some similarity\n                    between them and the Appellant’s Class 14 goods as watches and\n                    jewellery have similar use as being articles of adornment although watches have\n                    the additional function of being able to tell the time, see [73] of GD. I agree\n                    with these findings made by the PAR.64     The PAR held at [53] of the GD that the goods\n                    in Classes 9, 18 and 25 (ie, goods for which\n                    the Appellant’s other marks were registered) were not identical or similar\n                    to the goods of the Respondent’s mark. On appeal, the Appellant argued\n                    that the PAR erred in this respect. For ease of reference, the goods in\n                    Classes 9, 18 and 25 are as below:Classes of goods which the Appellant’s other\n                                        marks were registered forSpecification of goods in the Respondent’s\n                                        applicationClass\n                                                9SpectaclesClass\n                                                14Wrist watches, electric\n                                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks, necklaces, rings,\n                                            bracelets, earrings, medals and\n                                    brooches.Class\n                                                18Leather and imitation\n                                            leather; goods made of these materials and not included\n                                            in other classes; animal skins and hides; trunks and\n                                            suitcases; umbrellas; parasols and walking sticks;\n                                            whips, harness and saddleryClass\n                                                25Clothing and\n                                        footwear65     The Respondent submitted that the goods\n                    falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were evidently dissimilar from those of\n                    Class 14 as there was no overlap of goods. The Respondent objected to the\n                    Appellant’s attempt to categorise the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 and\n                    25 as “fashion accessories” as this would entail an expansion of\n                    the categories to include goods which otherwise would not be so classified. Such\n                    an unwarranted expansion was said to have the effect of defeating the whole\n                    purpose of having a system of classification. However, this submission may not\n                    be entirely correct. The fact that goods are classified into various classes\n                    under the ICGS does not preclude a finding that those goods are nevertheless\n                    similar in nature. This is because goods are so classified for administrative\n                    convenience whereas the question of whether goods are similar is an issue of\n                    substantive law, seeEl Corte Ingles SA v OHIM,\n                    Case T-443/05 [2007] ETMR (81) 1340 (“El\n                        Corte Ingles”) at [38].66     The Appellant, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that the relevant goods were “fashion accessories” and citedBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons\n                        Ltd[1996] RPC 281 (“British\n                        Sugar”) which was endorsed byOzone\n                        Community Corpat [75] as the proper test to be used in\n                    determining whether the goods were similar. The factors that were to be taken\n                    into account were (British Sugarat\n                    296-297):(a)The respective uses of the respective\n                            goods;(b)The respective end users of the respective\n                            goods;(c)The physical nature of the goods;(d)The respective trade channels through which the\n                            goods reach the market;(e)In the case of self-serve consumer items, whether\n                            in practice they are respectively found or likely to be found on the\n                            same or different shelves; and(f)Whether the respective goods are competitive or\n                            complementary. This inquiry may take into account how those in the trade\n                            classify goods, for instance whether market research companies who act\n                            for the industry put the goods or services in the same or different\n                            sectors.67     The Appellant further submitted thatQS by S. Oliver Trade Mark[1999] RPC 520\n                        (“QS”) was a constructive\n                    indicator of “similarity of goods”. InQS, it was held that leather goods, leather bags, purses,etcwould be regarded as “clothing\n                    accessories”. This was because these items were found to be complementary\n                    to clothing, had the same users and trade channels, and both would be found\n                    adjacent to each other in retail outlets.68     Building on this line of reasoning, the\n                    Appellant submitted that goods falling within Classes 9, 18 and 25 were\n                    frequently designed and manufactured by a single entity as they were all\n                    considered as fashion accessories and were complementary to the consumer’s\n                    style or get up. The Appellant pointed to various stores in Singapore such as\n                    “Calvin Klein” and “DKNY” where a diverse range of\n                    clothing and accessories, such as clothing, bags, shoes, jewellery and watches,\n                    could be found in the same store as they were intended to be put together as a\n                    particular look or style.69     Furthermore, there is now a trend among\n                    fashion designers to either license out their name or engage in brand extension.\n                    For instance, a brand that was previously well-known for handbags may now be\n                    selling sunglasses, clothes or even phones with its trade mark affixed on such\n                    goods. Thus, it was the Appellant’s submission that a consumer would\n                    expect that goods falling within one of the “fashion-related\n                    classes”,eg, Class14 (watches) and\n                    Class 25 (clothing and footwear), to have originated from the same source\n                    or from economically-linked undertakings.70     This idea of “aesthetic harmony”\n                    or “aesthetic complementarity” was discussed inBently & Shermanwhere two conflicting lines of cases\n                    decided by differently constituted CFI were given some consideration. In the\n                    case ofSergio Rossi SpA v OHIM, Sissi Rossi, Case\n                    T-169/03 [2005] ECR II-685, the CFI held that women’s bags and\n                    women’s footwear were not “aesthetically complementary” as\n                    the applicant had failed to demonstrate that this aesthetic complementary nature\n                    had reached a stage of “true aesthetic necessity” in the sense\n                    that the consumers would think it unusual or shocking to carry a bag which does\n                    not perfectly match their shoes. Subsequently, a CFI of five judges held that\n                    bags and clothes were sufficiently complementary to be regarded as similar, seeEl-Corte Inglesat [38]. In the absence of an\n                    ECJ decision, the authors ofBently & Shermanat p 871 opined that the second view, which was more open to the idea that\n                    consumers might draw connections between goods because they are searching for\n                    “aesthetic harmony”, to be more consistent with the general idea\n                    of a fact-sensitive “global appreciation” by the\n                Court.71     As the Appellant rightly observed, there is a\n                    growing phenomenon of brands expanding into goods of various kinds in recent\n                    years. Sometimes, the crossing-over takes place between goods that one does not\n                    commonly associate with each other, for instance, cigarettes and clothing. The\n                    idea of licensing out one’s trade mark or engaging in a sister brand or\n                    diffusion line has inevitably led to the same trade mark being found on a\n                    multitude of goods available in the market. In this regard, there is force in\n                    the Appellant’s submissions that there is a sense of\n                    “relatedness” between goods such as necklaces and clothing and a\n                    broad classification of these items as “fashion accessories” or\n                    “lifestyle goods” may be justified.72     Applying theBritish\n                        Sugartest to the present facts, it would be reasonable in the\n                    modern context to regard the goods in Classes 9, 14, 18 (trunks and\n                    suitcases and, in some instances, even umbrellas and parasols) and 25 as\n                    complementary in nature and are likely to be of similar uses, targeting almost\n                    identical end users and employing similar if not identical trade channels by\n                    which the goods reach the market. Thus, there issomesimilarity between “necklaces, rings, bracelets,\n                    earrings, medals and brooches” in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the goods for which the Appellant’s other marks are registered in\n                    Classes 9, 18 (the items specified above) and 25.73     However, the Appellant’s inclusion of\n                    the other goods in Class 18, such as walking sticks, whips, harness and\n                    saddlery, as “fashion accessories” would appear to be too\n                    over-reaching. To say that these items are “fashion accessories”\n                    which aresimilar to“necklaces, rings,\n                    bracelets, earrings, medal and brooches” would be to put an unnatural\n                    strain on the average consumer’s perception of what fashion accessories\n                    are. Thus, these items are not similar to the Class 14 goods in the\n                    Respondent’s application.74     The implication of the above finding that\n                    there is similarity between the goods in the Respondent’s application and\n                    the Appellant’s registered goods in Classes 9, 18 and 25 is that the\n                    Appellant’s other marks can be considered against the Respondent’s\n                    mark in determining whether there is a similarity of marks. For this purpose,\n                    the two competing marks are:Respondent’s markAppellant’s other marksTaking into account the Appellant’s other marks in the\n                    assessment lends even more force to the finding that there is similarity of\n                    marks as there is much greater visual similarity between the Appellant’s\n                    other marks (as opposed to the Appellant’s mark 1) and the\n                    Respondent’s mark.75     To summarize the findings thus far:(a)There is identity between the goods in the\n                            Respondent’s application for “wrist watches, electric\n                            watches, desk clocks, alarm clocks” and the Appellant’s\n                            goods in Class 14 for “watches, clocks and other\n                            chronometric instruments”;(b)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s Class 14\n                            goods;(c)There is similarity between “necklaces,\n                            rings, bracelets, earrings, medals and brooches” in the\n                            Respondent’s application and the Appellant’s goods in\n                            Classes 9, 18 (trunks and suitcases and, in some instances, even\n                            umbrellas and parasols) and 25.Indeed, with today’s creative proliferation of goods morphing and\n                    merging in functionalities and forms, one begins to wonder whether the\n                    classification of goods for trade mark purposes is becoming dated and whether it\n                    reflects present-day commerce.Condition 3: Likelihood of Confusion76     Having found that there is similarity of marks\n                    and identity in some goods and some similarity in others, we now turn to the\n                    assessment of whether there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                    public. As stated earlier, there is no presumption of confusion even where\n                    similarity of marks and goods are made out, seeOzone\n                        Community Corpat [81] and the Court of Appeal’s decision\n                    inThe Polo/Lauren Coat [8].77     Lee Seiu Kin J at [43] ofMediacorpdealt with the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion”:The following principles as to what constitutes \"likelihood of confusion\"\n                        can be distilled from the cases:(a)   The court is entitled to look outside the mark and\n                        the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                        likelihood of confusion (Polo/Lauren([29]supra) at [8]).(b)   The question of likelihood of confusion has to be\n                        looked at globally taking into account all the circumstances including\n                            (Polo/Laurenat [28]):(i)    the closeness of the goods;(ii)   the impression given by the marks;(iii)  the possibility of imperfect recollection;(iv)  the risk that the public might believe that the goods come\n                        from the same source or economically-linked sources;(v)   the steps taken by the defendant to differentiate the\n                        goods from those of the registered proprietor; and(vi)  the kind of customer who would be likely to buy the goods\n                        of the applicant and opponent.(c)   One should not determine the likelihood of confusion\n                        based on the man in a hurry, and the test should be the \"ordinary, sensible\n                        members of the public\" (Polo/Laurenat [31]).\n                        The average consumer is someone who would exercise some care and good sense\n                        in making his purchases (Polo/Laurenat [34]).\n                        However, the \"average consumer\" need not necessarily mean the general\n                        public, as more specialised products might be purchased by a more specific\n                        cross-section of the public (Nation Fittings (M) Sdn Bhd\n                            v Oystertec plc[2006] 1 SLR(R) 712 at\n                        [97]).(d)   The ambit of the protection offered by\n                        the Act to a registered proprietor of a trade mark should be guided by the\n                        underlying aim of the trade marks regime, which is to ensure that consumers\n                        do not confuse the trade source of one product with another (Polo/Laurenat [32]). The policy of s 8 of the\n                        Act is to protect the public against deception. InWeir\n                            Warman Ltd v Research & Development Pty Ltd[2007]\n                        2 SLR(R) 1073 , V K Rajah JA observed that (at [41]):It is plain that the trade mark register is intended to be a\n                            comprehensive and accurate record of trade marks currently in use. As\n                            such, it is crucial to maintain the accuracy of the register and to\n                            ensure that undeserving and invalid trade marks are removed from the\n                            register without undue delay and complication.In\n                                addition, the register is meant to assure and endorse the function\n                                of registered trade marks as badges of origin ... so as to protect\n                                the public against deception. Hence marks that are misleading or\n                                likely to cause confusion or no longer serve their function should\n                                not be accepted or allowed to remain on the register, as the case\n                                may be. [emphasis added]To this end, mere association which the public may make between two trade\n                        marks because of their semantic content is not in itself a sufficient basis\n                        for concluding that there is a likelihood of confusion, in the absence of\n                        any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods and\n                        services (Richemont International SA v Da Vinci\n                            Collections Pte Ltd(\"Richemont\") [2006] 4 SLR(R) 369 at [20]).(e)   The greater the exposure and use of a particular\n                        registered mark, the greater its reputation is likely to be, and therefore\n                        the greater the protection likely to be afforded to it (The Polo/Lauren Coat [34]).78     In relation to (a) above,ie, where “a court is entitled to look outside the mark\n                    and the sign”, Woo J inOzone Community\n                        Corpat [84] to [87] conducted a thorough review of the\n                    conflicting line of cases which differed on whether a court is entitled to\n                    consider extraneous factors in determining whether there is a likelihood of\n                    confusion and concluded in the affirmative. In addition to that, the ECJ inCanon Kabushiki Kaisha v Pathé Communications[1998] ETMR 366 andLloyd Schuhfabrikcases noted that the global assessment of likelihood of confusion implies some\n                    interdependence between the relevant factors, and in particular, similarity of\n                    marks and of goods.79     As pointed out earlier, both the\n                    Appellant’s and the Respondent’s marks have not been used in\n                    Singapore. Thus, an analysis of the issue of “likelihood of\n                    confusion” has to be made on the basis of a notional, normal and fair use\n                    of the marks, seeReact and Device Trade Mark[1999] RPC 529, 532.80     It is fair to say that the average consumer in\n                    Singapore is one who is literate, educated, exposed to the world and unlikely to\n                    be easily hoodwinked, seeMcDonald’s Corp v Future\n                        Enterprises Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR(R) 177 at\n                [64].81     Having considered the various factors, the PAR\n                    held (at [84] of the GD) that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part\n                    of the public as:(a)The goods in question,ie, watches and fashion accessories, had some areas of\n                            overlap but were not substitutes and were normally bought after much\n                            scrutiny and not at a whim, at [76] of GD;(b)An average price of $400.00 was assigned to the\n                            Appellant’s and Respondent’s watches respectively. The PAR\n                            opined that at such a price, the consumers were not likely to be\n                            careless with their purchase, at [77] of GD;(c)Consumers of fashion accessories would be a\n                            “conscious lot” who would exercise “some form of\n                            brand loyalty” thus taking pains to ensure that the purchased\n                            goods were of a particular brand, at [78] of GD;(d)Against the backdrop of a proliferation of\n                            different brands and products, consumers would be more deliberate and\n                            circumspect in their selection and purchase, at [79] of\n                        GD;(e)The mode of sales via specialist boutiques and\n                            departmental stores would mean that the visual appearances of the marks\n                            would be the main differentiating factor, at [80] of GD;(f)The Respondent had taken steps to differentiate\n                            their goods,viz, jewellery and watches,\n                            from the Appellant’s by way of development of a brand story which\n                            portrays a romantic, fairytale-like image of an Italian princess and\n                            Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet cat.\n                            In contrast, the Appellant’s goods tend to portray a more mature\n                            and sensual image, at [81] to [83] of GD.82     The average consumer is exposed to a variety\n                    of brands. There is also an increasing trend of brands venturing into diffusion\n                    lines so as to target different sectors of consumers. For instance, a brand that\n                    used to be associated only with female users may now branch into products for\n                    male users as well. Similarly, a brand known for its upmarket products may want\n                    to make inroads into a more affordable product range. Consumers generally regard\n                    the main and diffusion lines to be of the same source.Bently\n                        & Shermanat p 872 discusses what “likelihood of\n                    confusion” under the UK equivalent of s 8(2)(b) TMA connotes (footnotes omitted):In its ‘classic’ form, consumers must be confused about the\n                        source or origin of the goods or services – that is, they must be\n                        confused as to the designer, manufacturer, selector or supplier of the goods\n                        or services. In other words, classic confusion is concerned with the\n                        situation where consumers believe that the goods or services emanate from\n                        one organization, but they, in fact come from a different independent\n                        organization. This classic form of confusion has been extended to\n                        accommodate broader understandings of the source of goods or services.\n                        Consequently, a person will be confused for the purposes of [UK equivalent\n                        of s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                        assume that there is some broader kind ofeconomic\n                            connectionbetween the users of marks, for example, that the\n                        goods are being provided by a subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark\n                        owner. …In considering whether there is a likelihood of confusion, the tribunals\n                        must consider whether there is a genuine and properly substantiated\n                        likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that confusion is hypothetical and\n                        remote. The term ‘likelihood’ indicates probability rather than\n                        possibility. …[italics in original]83     Similar toCity Chain\n                        Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2010]\n                    1 SLR 382 (“City Chain\n                    Stores”), the Appellant’s goods in Class 14 include\n                    watches. The Court of Appeal inCity Chain Storesat [56] held that since a watch is a product which is commonly available and\n                    purchased by the general public, the average consumer would be the general\n                    public. Thus, it follows that the nature of the members of public is a relevant\n                    consideration. The Court of Appeal went on to say as follows:The average consumer is not an unthinking person in a hurry but someone\n                        who would exercise some care and good sense in making his purchases\n                        …Thus, it was held when luxury goods are purchased, they are bought\n                    after careful inspection and deliberation.(1)   Is there a possibility that the consumers would be confused\n                that “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” are from the same or\n                economically-linked undertakings?84     In considering this question, the function of\n                    the respective marks as badges of origin of the goods becomes especially\n                    important. The marks “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” both\n                    end with “-ESTINA” which is part of an invented word with no\n                    meaning in itself. Apart from their similarity discussed earlier, one must also\n                    consider the possibility that the consumer would see the letters\n                    “ESTINA” as a common suffix and therefore associate goods with the\n                    same (invented) suffix “ESTINA” to be from economically-linked\n                    sources.85     In the case ofDurferrit\n                        GmbH v OHIM, T-244/01 [2003] ECR II-1589,\n                    “NUTRIDE” and “TUFFTRIDE” were held by the CFI to be\n                    dissimilar despite sharing the same suffix “-TRIDE. However, there are\n                    counter examples such asJulian James’ Application:\n                        Opposition of Smart GmbH[2005] ETMR (93) 1096 where\n                    “CARSMART” was held to be similar to “SMART” (albeit\n                    in part due to “CAR” being descriptive). Notably, these\n                    counter-examples serve to illustrate that rulings are\n                    “fact-specific” and asBently &\n                        Shermannotes at p 866, such examples have virtually no value as\n                    precedents.86     It was held inCity Chain\n                        Storesat [58] (approving the approach inRichemont International SA v Goldlion Enterprise (Singapore) Pte\n                        Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 401 at [20]) that in the absence of\n                    any possibility of a misapprehension as to the origin of the goods or services,\n                    the mere association of the public between Solvil’s “Solvil\n                    Flower” and Louis Vuitton’s “Flower Quatrefoil mark”\n                    based on their similar use was not a sufficient basis for concluding that there\n                    is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the members of public.87     Notably, unlikeCity Chain\n                        Storeswhere there was a stark disparity in price between the\n                    parties’ watches,ie, $200 and (at least)\n                    $4,000 respectively, there is no such disparity between the Appellant’s\n                    and Respondent’s watches, both of which are marked at around $400. It is\n                    important to recognise that “a 50 pence purchase in the station kiosk\n                    will involve different considerations from a once-in-a-lifetime expenditure of\n                    £50,000” (as per Pumfrey J inPicasso v\n                        OHIM, T-104/01 [2002] ECR II-4359). It may be argued\n                    that it is unlikely that the average consumer would freely and whimsically spend\n                    $400 on a watch without much consideration prior to the purchase and that\n                    although the average consumer might do a “double-take” when\n                    looking at “FESTINA” and “J.ESTINA” by virtue of\n                    similarity of marks, at a price of $400, the consumer will exercise some degree\n                    of prudence and pause for a moment to ensure that he is purchasing a watch from\n                    the desired brand.88     Even if there is an association between the\n                    two marks owing to the common “-ESTINA”, this association by\n                    itself, short of a misapprehension of origin of the goods, may not warrant a\n                    finding of likelihood of confusion. Some evidence would need to be adduced to\n                    indicate such an association on account of the advertisements, methods of sale\n                    and/or packaging of the Appellant’s and Respondent’s items or for\n                    any other reason. Otherwise, the risk of confusion is merely hypothetical and\n                    speculative because there is simply no evidence of any such confusion arising on\n                    the part of the consumers; seeCity Chain Storesat [57].89     In this regard, the steps taken by the\n                    Respondent to differentiate its goods from those of the Appellant’s become\n                    pertinent. As Lai Kew Chai J inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v\n                        Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005] 4 SLR(R) 816 at\n                    [21] opined, where the user of a potentially infringing sign had taken pains to\n                    distinguish his products from the registered proprietor’s goods, the\n                    effect might be that the likelihood of confusion, if any, was merely\n                    hypothetical or speculative. The Respondent here submitted that it had taken\n                    steps in differentiating its goods from the Appellant’s given that its\n                    target consumer was wholly different from the Appellant’s. The Respondent\n                    referred to its brand story which projected a dainty image of an Italian\n                    princess and Bulgarian queen adorned with her tiara and accompanied by her pet\n                    cat. Accordingly, it was argued that this brand story was likely to draw the\n                    attention and patronage of younger female consumers. In stark contrast, the\n                    Appellant’s goods were advertised in more mature materials thus conveying\n                    an image of maturity and sensuality aimed at older and more established female\n                    consumers.90     Unlike the situation inCity Chain Storeswhere Solvil watches averaging $200 in price\n                    were pitted against Louis Vuitton watches costing at least thousands of dollars,\n                    we have here goods of similar pricing which may be described as low to\n                    medium-range, bearing in mind the standard of living in Singapore. There was no\n                    evidence that the Appellant’s or the Respondent’s watches were sold\n                    in specialty stores (unlike those of Louis Vuitton). We are comparing marks\n                    which bear words and pictures resembling each other and not merely four-petal\n                    stylised flower designs (Louis Vuitton’s flower design inCity Chain Storeswas considered not to be that\n                    well-known standing on its own anyway). We also do not know how the parties will\n                    market or advertise their goods in Singapore as both do not have a presence here\n                    at the moment. With the similarity in the marks and in the goods as discussed\n                    earlier, there is a real likelihood that the consumer may mistake one brand for\n                    the other or believe erroneously that the two are related and have the same\n                    origin or come from economically-linked sources.91     The Respondent’s brand story does not\n                    serve as a differentiating measure as there is no brand story on the\n                    Appellant’s part. In any event, merely having the brand story on its\n                    website is far removed from having it in routine advertisements. Indeed, by\n                    giving a European setting to its brand name, the Respondent (with its origin in\n                    the Far East) increases the likelihood of confusion between FESTINA and\n                    J.ESTINA. I will have more to comment on the brand story later when I deal with\n                    the issue of bad faith.92     In all the circumstances of the case, I am of\n                    the view that the likelihood of confusion is a probability and not a mere\n                    possibility. With respect, the PAR’s opinion on this issue was premised on\n                    her findings from which I have departed materially. Accordingly, the Appellant\n                    is entitled to succeed in its opposition based on s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA.Appeal against PAR’s decision under s 7(6) TMA93     s 7(6) TMA stipulates as follows:Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration7. —(1) …(6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith.94     The PAR held at [113] of the GD that the\n                    Respondent’s act of registering “J.ESTINA” was not\n                    sufficient to show that its act fell short of the standard of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade. Thus, the PAR opined that bad faith was not established.95     The Appellant submitted that given the\n                    Appellant’s establishment since 1902 and the successful sales it has in\n                    Hong Kong and Japan, the Respondent was very likely to have been aware of the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA and device”. The Appellant also\n                    took issue with the Respondent’s failure to tender any written submissions\n                    on the issue of bad faith. In particular, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent failed to provide evidence of any “Jovanna Estina” or\n                    even any “Estina family” with ties to royalty (in its brand\n                    story).96     The Appellant citedPolo\n                        Spirit Pte Ltd v S. Tous S.L[2009] SGIPOS 3 for the\n                    proposition that when bad faith is alleged by either party, the party who is\n                    second in time has the onus of explaining how he came about using or registering\n                    the mark. Moreover, the Appellant sought to rely onKundry\n                        SA’s Application: Opposition by the President and Fellows of Harvard\n                        College[1998] ETMR 178, for the proposition that where\n                    the applicant had not rebutted such serious claims of bad faith by way of\n                    counterstatement or evidence, the opposition would be allowed to\n                proceed.97     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that since the two marks were completely different, no issue of bad faith arose\n                    in the present case. In any event, the derivation of the Respondent’s mark\n                    was sufficiently explained in the brand story,ie,\n                    the initial “J” stands for “Jovanna” which is\n                    derived from the name of an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen known as\n                    “Jovanna Elizabeth Antonia Romana Marie” and revolves around\n                    princess Jovanna’s name, her tiara and her pet cat “Jenna”.\n                    The Respondent argued that it never maintained that the Respondent’s mark\n                    was indeed the princess’ name.98     An allegation that a trade mark has been\n                    applied for in bad faith is a serious one. In “Royal\n                        Enfield” Trade Marks[2002] RPC 24 at [31]\n                    (endorsed by the Court of Appeal inFuture\n                        Enterprisesat [78]) it was held that:A plea of fraud should not lightly be made ... and if made should be\n                        distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not permissible to leave\n                        fraud to be inferred from the facts (seeDavy v\n                            Garrett(1877-78) L.R. 7 Ch.D. 473 at 489). … It\n                        should not be made unless it can be fully and properly pleaded and should\n                        not be upheld unless it is distinctly proved and this will rarely be\n                        possible by a process of inference.Notably, this sets a high threshold for an allegation of bad faith to\n                    be met by the Appellant.99     The findings of Geoffrey Hobbs QC inDemon Ale Trade Mark[2000] RPC 345 with\n                    regard to the expression “bad faith” was cited with approval inNautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard and\n                        another[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 (“Nautical\n                    Concept”) at [19]:[There are] moral overtones which appear to make it possible for an\n                        application for registration to be rendered invalid ... by behaviour which\n                        otherwise involves no breach of any duty, obligation, prohibition or\n                        requirement that is legally binding upon the applicant.The logical consequence of this is such that once bad faith is\n                    established, the application to register a trade mark in question will not be\n                    allowed even if the mark does not cause any confusion or breach of\n                duty.What is “bad faith”?100    Bad faith is to be determined as at the date\n                    of application and matters which occurred after the date of application which\n                    may assist in determining the applicant’s state of mind as at the date of\n                    application can be taken into consideration, seeFerrero\n                        SpA’s Trade Marks (Kinder), O/279/03\n                    [2004] RPC (29) 253.101    Lindsay J inGromax\n                        Plasticulture Ltd v Don & Low Nonwovens Ltd[1999] RPC 367 at 379 discussed what the concept of “bad\n                    faith” connotes:I shall not attempt to define bad faith in this context. Plainly it\n                        includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which\n                        fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by\n                        reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined.\n                        Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not\n                        bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short as to amount\n                        to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by\n                        the courts (which leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the\n                        Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a\n                        regard to all material surrounding circumstances.102    AsBently &\n                        Shermanat p 851 observes, the courts have struggled to find a\n                    satisfactory definition of “bad faith” and have ultimately aligned\n                    the definition in trade mark law with that operating in other areas of civil\n                    liability, particularly the so-called “knowing assistance” in\n                    breach of trust, seeHarrison’s Trade Mark\n                        Application[2005] FSR 10\n                    (“Harrison’s”). InHarrison’s, Sir William Aldous discussed the notion of\n                    “bad faith” at [24] and [26]:Clearly the court, when considering bad faith, cannot apply a purely\n                        subjective test, called by Lord Hutton [inTwinsectra Ltd\n                            v Yardley[2002] 2 AC 164] the “Robin Hood\n                        test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards cannot be\n                        permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances where a person\n                        abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The registration of trade mark\n                        is designed to enablebona fideproprietors to\n                        protect their proprietary rights without having to prove unfair trading.\n                        Registration is not provided to help those with low moral standards.…For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord Hutton [in relation to\n                        “dishonesty”] as applying to considerations of bad faith. The\n                        words “bad faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when\n                        considering the question of whether an application to register is made in\n                        bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must\n                        decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to\n                        apply for registration would be regarded as bad faith by persons adopting\n                        proper standards.103    The authors ofBently\n                        & Shermanat p 852 note that instances of “bad\n                    faith” can be placed into three categories:(a)No intention to use the mark;(b)Abuse of a relationship;(c)Where the applicant was aware that a third party\n                            had some sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark.104    The following cases demonstrate the meaning\n                    of bad faith according to the above categorization:(a)   No intention to use the mark105    In the case ofPT\n                        Swakarya Indah Busana v Dhan International Exim Pte Ltd[2010]\n                    2 SLR 109, Lai Siu Chiu J found that after registering the mark\n                    “EMPEROR MARTIN” in 2002, the defendant did not intend to use the\n                    mark. Instead, on the shirts sold by the defendant was the defendant’s\n                    tailored mark (as opposed to the registered mark) which showed the word\n                    “MARTIN” in a much more prominent font than that of\n                    “Emperor”. Lai J found that there was an obvious and\n                    conscious effort on the part of the defendant to copy the plaintiff’s mark\n                    in the usage of the word “MARTIN”. The plaintiff had a total of\n                    six marks registered in Singapore, all of which included the name\n                    “MARTIN”) and there was a deliberate preference to use the\n                    defendant’s tailored mark instead of the defendant’s registered\n                    mark. Thus, the lack ofbona fideintention to use\n                    the mark in the form that was applied to be registered was found to be an act of\n                    bad faith.(b)   Abuse of a relationship106    InNautical\n                        Concept, Tan Lee Meng J found the appellant there to have\n                    acted in bad faith when it sought to register its “JWest” mark. It\n                    was held that in the light of the appellant’s history of dealings with the\n                    respondent and its blatant attempt to take advantage of the respondent’s\n                    trade mark,ie, “Jeffery West” and\n                    “JW” time and time again in the past, its attempt to register the\n                    “JWest” mark was regarded as an unacceptable business tactic\n                    adopted in relation to the respondent’s trade mark. The appellant’s\n                    attempt to explain the derivation of its mark was found to be too far-fetched;\n                    at [26] ofNautical Concept. Tan J agreed\n                    with the PAR’s decision there that the “sheer elaborateness of the\n                    explanations” for the selection of one letter of the mark (the letter\n                    “J”) made it difficult to believe the appellant’s reasons\n                    for choosing the mark “JWest”. This was especially so when there\n                    was a glaring omission on the appellant’s part to mention that its\n                    managing director once distributed shoes under the mark “Jeffery\n                    West” and “JW” for the respondent.107    A finding of bad faith can also be made\n                    where the applicant was aware that someone else intends to use and/or register\n                    the mark, particularly where the applicant has a relationship, for example as\n                    employee or agent, with that other person, or where the applicant has copied a\n                    mark being used abroad with the intention of pre-empting the proprietor who\n                    intends to trade in the specific country, seeDaawat Trade\n                        Mark[2003] RPC 11 at [93]. Similarly, where an\n                    applicant attempts, by means of registration, to seize a trade mark of a third\n                    party with whom he had a contractual or pre-contractual relationship, the\n                    registration would also be found to have been made in bad faith, seeLancome Parfums et Beaute & Cie’s Community Trade Mark\n                        Application[2001] ETMR 89 (“Lancome\n                    Parfums”) at [33].(c)   Where the applicant was aware that a third party had some\n                sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark108    InRothmans of Pall Mall\n                        Ltd v Maycolson International Pte Ltd[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 551 (“Rothmans”),\n                    having regard to the totality of evidence, Lai Siu Chiu J at [36] to [41]\n                    found that various instances of bad faith could be inferred in that case. For\n                    instance, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incorporation of the\n                    respondent company suggested that it was merely a “shell company”\n                    used by the Hertlein brothers to propagate the use of the\n                    “Fairlight” mark in relation to cigarettes. Moreover, despite a\n                    Europe-wide injunction which at that time prevented the Hertlein brothers from\n                    using the “Fairlight” mark and packaging, they have repeatedly\n                    shown their improper motives to capitalise on the appellant's reputation and\n                    goodwill by their attempt to sidestep the terms of the injunction, as well as by\n                    their persistence in associating themselves with the proprietor's trade marks.\n                    Such an association with the appellants can be seen from the Hertlein\n                    brothers’ lack of candour when explaining their advertising strategies\n                    which blatantly claimed that \"Fairlight\" cigarettes were similar in taste and\n                    packaging to the appellant’s \"Rothmans\" cigarettes or that\n                    “Fairlight” cigarettes resembled the appellant’s \"Rothmans\"\n                    cigarettes.109    Other illustrations of bad faith can be also\n                    be seen inInterkrenn Maschinen Vertriebs GmbH’s\n                        Community Trade Mark[2002] ETMR 27 whereby the\n                    applicant conclusively showed that there was a person who was linked to the\n                    trade mark proprietor and who had obtained knowledge of a planned trade mark of\n                    the applicant during a business meeting. This scenario was dubbed as a classic\n                    case of “trade mark theft”.110    During the course of submissions, parties\n                    were invited to address the court on whether “bad faith” was a\n                    stand-alone, distinct ground of opposition which was independent of attending\n                    confusion or whether a “twin-approach” should be taken (in the\n                    sense that bad faith can be relied upon in order to tilt the balance in deciding\n                    whether there was confusion between the two marks).111    The Appellant submitted that there has to beat leastsome similarity between the two marks\n                    before bad faith can be established, thus alluding to a case of\n                    “copying” of the proprietor’s mark. Alternatively, the\n                    Appellant reiterated Lai J’s decision inRothmansin which it was held at [29] thatdespite the fact that the marks in question are not so similar as to cause\n                        confusion, bad faith can still be established on the\n                    facts.112    As for the Respondent, it maintained that\n                    nothing short of a “distinct proof of unacceptable commercial\n                    behaviour” should warrant a finding of bad faith. This position, however,\n                    seems to be a rather abstract postulation of what the court should do in\n                    determining whether bad faith arose on the facts.113    From the case law discussed above, it\n                    appears that bad faith encompasses “underhand practice involving absence\n                    of good faith on the part of the [trade mark applicant]” (in the words ofLancome Parfumsat [33]. As bad faith is an\n                    “absolute ground for refusal”, this suggests that it is an\n                    independent and distinct ground for refusing the registration of marks in its\n                    own right. As noted by Lai J inRothmans,\n                    this view is consonant with Tan Tee Jim SC’s observations inLaw of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell Asia, 2ndEd, 2005) at paragraph\n                    5.71:Once bad faith is established, the application will be refused, even\n                        though the offending conduct does not cause any confusion or breach any\n                        duty, obligation, prohibition or other legally binding requirement.114    However, the numerous attempts in drawing\n                    the parameters of “bad faith” by various courts are vivid\n                    illustrations of the inherently abstract nature of this concept. The concept of\n                    bad faith is extremely wide in the sense that the courts can infer instances of\n                    bad faith and decide according to the justice of individual cases. Naturally,\n                    the court should also be cautious in not over-extending this concept lest it\n                    becomes a weapon of terror against competitors of trade mark\n                proprietors.115    The categorization byBently & Shermanas seen above hints that despite the broad\n                    nature of the notion of bad faith, one must showsome sort of\n                        nexusbetween the parties in dispute. Otherwise, the notion of\n                    bad faith would have to be decided in vacuum. A clear-cut example of such a\n                    nexus would be an outright copying of the proprietor’s mark such that the\n                    two competing marks are practically identical. However, the nexus may be in the\n                    guise of something more subtle. In finding a nexus between the parties, a\n                    parallel may be drawn between ss 8(2)(b) and\n                    s 7(6) TMA. For example, there may be cases where although there issomesimilarity of marks or of the goods or\n                    services, it falls short of confusing similarity (ie, no likelihood of confusion) within the meaning of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. Nevertheless, the evidence\n                    of this similarity may be taken into account and considered against the\n                    background facts from which bad faith may be inferred. In other words, while the\n                    finding of bad faith is largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial\n                    evidence, the party alleging bad faith needs to show some link between the\n                    parties, perhaps by way of a pre-existing relationship or some acts of\n                    association with the proprietor or some nexus between the two competing\n                    marks.116    There may be a fine line between being\n                    inspired by another’s trade mark as opposed to blatant copying or copying\n                    with some modifications made to the mark. The former would not attract punitive\n                    measures whereas the latter would lead to the mark being rejected. Where the\n                    dividing line between “inspiration” and\n                    “infringement” should be drawn is a matter best left to the facts\n                    peculiar to any case.Was the Respondent’s registration of “J.ESTINA”\n                made in bad faith?117    The Appellant argued that the lack of\n                    response from the Respondent against the claim of bad faith was far from\n                    satisfactory. Even if the Respondent’s brand story was taken as some sort\n                    of explanation of the derivation of the brand name, it was argued that the brand\n                    story was incapable of holding up against scrutiny. Thus, the only inference was\n                    that the Respondent’s mark was a product of copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark.118    As this was not the first time the parties\n                    have been embroiled in litigation, the Appellant sought to draw the\n                    court’s attention to previous instances of litigation between the\n                    parties:(a)An opposition in South Korea Opposition No.\n                            40-2006-000245 in relation to the Respondent’s other mark\n                            “Estina Donna & Device” which was successfully opposed\n                            by the Appellant;(b)An opposition in relation to Korean Trade Mark\n                            Application No. 2002-0046412 for “J.ESTINA” in respect of\n                            Class 14 which was dismissed as the marks were found to be\n                            dissimilar and no likelihood of confusion was held to\n                        exist;(c)A decision by the Office for Harmonisation in the\n                            Internal Market (“OHIM”) in respect of Opposition No.\n                            B765356 issued on 26 April 2006 in favour of Appellant. The Respondent\n                            submitted that the OHIM had issued its decision based on evidence before\n                            it without having considered any submissions or representations by the\n                            Respondent as it had, for purely commercial reasons, not filed any\n                            observation or response to the Appellant’s opposition. The\n                            Respondent was there seeking to use the mark “JOVANNA\n                            ESTINA” instead of “J.ESTINA” in\n                        Europe;(d)A censure issued by the Arbitration Panel at\n                            Baselworld (Watch and Jewellery Show) on 2 April 2006 which prohibited\n                            the Respondent from using “J.ESTINA” in relation to, among\n                            other things, jewellery, precious stones, horological and chronometric\n                            instruments for the duration of the show. The Respondent submitted that\n                            the Arbitration Panel was an unofficial adjudicating body having no\n                            juridical authority over the parties and its decision should have no\n                            bearing upon the court’s decision here. Further, as the trade show\n                            was for a short duration only, it was simply not expedient to contest\n                            the Appellant’s allegations.As the PAR rightly observed, litigation between the parties in other\n                    jurisdictions serves at best as guides to opposition proceedings here. The\n                    relevance of these decisions will hinge upon the similarity of the laws of the\n                    particular jurisdiction with those of Singapore and also upon the individual\n                    facts of the case, at [118] of GD.119    The Appellant also pointed out that the\n                    Respondent had sought to register the mark “Jovanna Estina” in\n                    Singapore on 20 June 2008 in Trade Mark No. T 0808240Z, in respect of\n                    Class 14 goods. This date fell between the date of notice of opposition\n                    filed by the Appellant (22 September 2006) and the date the GD was rendered\n                    (8 February 2009). The fact that the Respondent thought it necessary to\n                    register an alternative mark in respect of the identical class of goods between\n                    those dates could not be coincidental. The Appellant, by way of Mr. Javier\n                    Ribas’ statutory declaration, submitted that the Respondent’s action\n                    was an indication that it was not confident that it would be able to avoid being\n                    held to be in infringement of the Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”\n                    by its use of “J.ESTINA”.120    In Mr. Myoung-chul Shin’s\n                    statutory declaration, it was said that a commissioned group was set up in order\n                    to come up with a brand name for their jewellery/watch line. A total of 14\n                    European-sounding names were suggested and considered and by process of\n                    elimination, “J.ESTINA” was chosen. A Report on Result of Naming\n                    Research for New Business was made on 1 October 2002 in which\n                    “J.ESTINA” was finally selected, accompanied by a note stating\n                    that “a crown device may be added”. The letter “J”\n                    in “J.ESTINA” was said to have derived from\n                    “Jovanna” who was an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. This\n                    brand story appears on the Respondent’s website which shows a princess, a\n                    tiara, and her pet car “Jenna”.121    A graphic presentation (in the form of a\n                    mind map) of the various names that were considered, amongst them being\n                    “J.ESTINA”, was also adduced as evidence in the Bundle of\n                    Documents, Volume II Part B. The graphic presentation showed the various factors\n                    that were taken into account in the process of naming,ie, originality, luxury, royal family, targeting consumers\n                    between 25 and 35 years of age. The graphic presentation also showed that the\n                    brand slogan was “Modern Renaissance” and the brand concept was\n                    one of “European Modern Jewellery”. Three graphs were similarly\n                    adduced to show the process of elimination of the other shortlisted13 names and\n                    also the degree of registrability of the final five names.122    In my opinion, the Respondent’s brand\n                    story on the name “J.ESTINA” appears extremely contrived. Firstly,\n                    the use of Princess Jovanna’s name (compressed to “J.”) only\n                    explains the use of the letter “J”. It does not explain why the\n                    meaningless word “ESTINA” was chosen. The six letters in\n                    “ESTINA” are not even the initials of “Jovanna Elizabeth\n                    Antonia Romana Marie” nor do they have any nexus with the tiara or the\n                    pet cat “Jenna” which were repeatedly referred to whenever the\n                    question of derivation of the brand name was raised. The brand story certainly\n                    does not answer any of the queries regarding the derivation of\n                    “ESTINA”. As mentioned at[90]above, giving a European setting to the story merely reinforces the association\n                    between the two competing marks.123    The graphs which supposedly illustrate the\n                    process of ultimately choosing the name “J.ESTINA” also do not\n                    explain in any way how the word “ESTINA” came into being. As the\n                    Respondent has conceded, “ESTINA” is an invented word with no\n                    meaning. The failure to furnish the court with a credible explanation of how\n                    “ESTINA” in the brand name “J.ESTINA” was derived,\n                    where the explanation is particularly pertinent since 6 out of 7 letters are in\n                    identical sequence in the two competing marks, can only lead to the irresistible\n                    conclusion that the word “ESTINA” was blatantly copied from the\n                    Appellant by a “cut and paste” job. The adding of\n                    “J” with a dot just before “ESTINA” makes little\n                    difference to the final name as both words in the competing marks (including the\n                    Appellant’s other marks) would still look alike and sound remarkably\n                    similar whether “J.ESTINA” is pronounced\n                    “jay-estina” (with the “jay” sound likely to be\n                    slurred) or “jes-tina”. Such outright copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark is an act that falls short of the acceptable commercial\n                    behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade.124    In these circumstances, the\n                    Respondent’s registration of T05/25465Z was undoubtedly made in bad faith.\n                    I therefore have to disagree with the PAR on this issue as well and allow the\n                    Appellant’s objection based on s 7(6) TMA. The Respondent’s\n                    application to register its mark should accordingly be refused.Conclusion125    For the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Appellant’s appeal is allowed on the basis of its opposition based on\n                    s 7(6) and s 8(2)(b) TMA.126    The Respondent is to pay the Appellant the\n                    costs of this appeal which are to be taxed or agreed.127    I thank counsel for both parties for their\n                    written and oral submissions which were of great assistance to me.",
        "Appeal against PAR’s decision under s 7(6) TMA": "93     s 7(6) TMA stipulates as follows: Absolute grounds for refusal of\n                        registration 7. —(1) … (6) A trade mark shall not be registered if or to the extent that the\n                        application is made in bad faith. 94     The PAR held at [113] of the GD that the\n                    Respondent’s act of registering “J.ESTINA” was not\n                    sufficient to show that its act fell short of the standard of acceptable\n                    commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade. Thus, the PAR opined that bad faith was not established. 95     The Appellant submitted that given the\n                    Appellant’s establishment since 1902 and the successful sales it has in\n                    Hong Kong and Japan, the Respondent was very likely to have been aware of the\n                    Appellant’s mark “FESTINA and device”. The Appellant also\n                    took issue with the Respondent’s failure to tender any written submissions\n                    on the issue of bad faith. In particular, the Appellant argued that the\n                    Respondent failed to provide evidence of any “Jovanna Estina” or\n                    even any “Estina family” with ties to royalty (in its brand\n                    story). 96     The Appellant citedPolo\n                        Spirit Pte Ltd v S. Tous S.L[2009] SGIPOS 3 for the\n                    proposition that when bad faith is alleged by either party, the party who is\n                    second in time has the onus of explaining how he came about using or registering\n                    the mark. Moreover, the Appellant sought to rely onKundry\n                        SA’s Application: Opposition by the President and Fellows of Harvard\n                        College[1998] ETMR 178, for the proposition that where\n                    the applicant had not rebutted such serious claims of bad faith by way of\n                    counterstatement or evidence, the opposition would be allowed to\n                proceed. 97     The Respondent, on the other hand, submitted\n                    that since the two marks were completely different, no issue of bad faith arose\n                    in the present case. In any event, the derivation of the Respondent’s mark\n                    was sufficiently explained in the brand story,ie,\n                    the initial “J” stands for “Jovanna” which is\n                    derived from the name of an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen known as\n                    “Jovanna Elizabeth Antonia Romana Marie” and revolves around\n                    princess Jovanna’s name, her tiara and her pet cat “Jenna”.\n                    The Respondent argued that it never maintained that the Respondent’s mark\n                    was indeed the princess’ name. 98     An allegation that a trade mark has been\n                    applied for in bad faith is a serious one. In “Royal\n                        Enfield” Trade Marks[2002] RPC 24 at [31]\n                    (endorsed by the Court of Appeal inFuture\n                        Enterprisesat [78]) it was held that: A plea of fraud should not lightly be made ... and if made should be\n                        distinctly alleged and distinctly proved. It is not permissible to leave\n                        fraud to be inferred from the facts (seeDavy v\n                            Garrett(1877-78) L.R. 7 Ch.D. 473 at 489). … It\n                        should not be made unless it can be fully and properly pleaded and should\n                        not be upheld unless it is distinctly proved and this will rarely be\n                        possible by a process of inference. Notably, this sets a high threshold for an allegation of bad faith to\n                    be met by the Appellant. 99     The findings of Geoffrey Hobbs QC inDemon Ale Trade Mark[2000] RPC 345 with\n                    regard to the expression “bad faith” was cited with approval inNautical Concept Pte Ltd v Jeffery Mark Richard and\n                        another[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1071 (“Nautical\n                    Concept”) at [19]: [There are] moral overtones which appear to make it possible for an\n                        application for registration to be rendered invalid ... by behaviour which\n                        otherwise involves no breach of any duty, obligation, prohibition or\n                        requirement that is legally binding upon the applicant. The logical consequence of this is such that once bad faith is\n                    established, the application to register a trade mark in question will not be\n                    allowed even if the mark does not cause any confusion or breach of\n                duty. What is “bad faith”? 100    Bad faith is to be determined as at the date\n                    of application and matters which occurred after the date of application which\n                    may assist in determining the applicant’s state of mind as at the date of\n                    application can be taken into consideration, seeFerrero\n                        SpA’s Trade Marks (Kinder), O/279/03\n                    [2004] RPC (29) 253. 101    Lindsay J inGromax\n                        Plasticulture Ltd v Don & Low Nonwovens Ltd[1999] RPC 367 at 379 discussed what the concept of “bad\n                    faith” connotes: I shall not attempt to define bad faith in this context. Plainly it\n                        includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which\n                        fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by\n                        reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined.\n                        Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not\n                        bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short as to amount\n                        to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by\n                        the courts (which leads to the danger of the courts then construing not the\n                        Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a\n                        regard to all material surrounding circumstances. 102    AsBently &\n                        Shermanat p 851 observes, the courts have struggled to find a\n                    satisfactory definition of “bad faith” and have ultimately aligned\n                    the definition in trade mark law with that operating in other areas of civil\n                    liability, particularly the so-called “knowing assistance” in\n                    breach of trust, seeHarrison’s Trade Mark\n                        Application[2005] FSR 10\n                    (“Harrison’s”). InHarrison’s, Sir William Aldous discussed the notion of\n                    “bad faith” at [24] and [26]: Clearly the court, when considering bad faith, cannot apply a purely\n                        subjective test, called by Lord Hutton [inTwinsectra Ltd\n                            v Yardley[2002] 2 AC 164] the “Robin Hood\n                        test”. The dishonest person or one with low standards cannot be\n                        permitted to obtain trade mark registrations in circumstances where a person\n                        abiding by a reasonable standard would not. The registration of trade mark\n                        is designed to enablebona fideproprietors to\n                        protect their proprietary rights without having to prove unfair trading.\n                        Registration is not provided to help those with low moral standards. … For my part, I would accept the reasoning of Lord Hutton [in relation to\n                        “dishonesty”] as applying to considerations of bad faith. The\n                        words “bad faith” suggest a mental state. Clearly when\n                        considering the question of whether an application to register is made in\n                        bad faith all the circumstances will be relevant. However the court must\n                        decide whether the knowledge of the applicant was such that his decision to\n                        apply for registration would be regarded as bad faith by persons adopting\n                        proper standards. 103    The authors ofBently\n                        & Shermanat p 852 note that instances of “bad\n                    faith” can be placed into three categories: (a)No intention to use the mark;(b)Abuse of a relationship;(c)Where the applicant was aware that a third party\n                            had some sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark.104    The following cases demonstrate the meaning\n                    of bad faith according to the above categorization:(a)   No intention to use the mark105    In the case ofPT\n                        Swakarya Indah Busana v Dhan International Exim Pte Ltd[2010]\n                    2 SLR 109, Lai Siu Chiu J found that after registering the mark\n                    “EMPEROR MARTIN” in 2002, the defendant did not intend to use the\n                    mark. Instead, on the shirts sold by the defendant was the defendant’s\n                    tailored mark (as opposed to the registered mark) which showed the word\n                    “MARTIN” in a much more prominent font than that of\n                    “Emperor”. Lai J found that there was an obvious and\n                    conscious effort on the part of the defendant to copy the plaintiff’s mark\n                    in the usage of the word “MARTIN”. The plaintiff had a total of\n                    six marks registered in Singapore, all of which included the name\n                    “MARTIN”) and there was a deliberate preference to use the\n                    defendant’s tailored mark instead of the defendant’s registered\n                    mark. Thus, the lack ofbona fideintention to use\n                    the mark in the form that was applied to be registered was found to be an act of\n                    bad faith.(b)   Abuse of a relationship106    InNautical\n                        Concept, Tan Lee Meng J found the appellant there to have\n                    acted in bad faith when it sought to register its “JWest” mark. It\n                    was held that in the light of the appellant’s history of dealings with the\n                    respondent and its blatant attempt to take advantage of the respondent’s\n                    trade mark,ie, “Jeffery West” and\n                    “JW” time and time again in the past, its attempt to register the\n                    “JWest” mark was regarded as an unacceptable business tactic\n                    adopted in relation to the respondent’s trade mark. The appellant’s\n                    attempt to explain the derivation of its mark was found to be too far-fetched;\n                    at [26] ofNautical Concept. Tan J agreed\n                    with the PAR’s decision there that the “sheer elaborateness of the\n                    explanations” for the selection of one letter of the mark (the letter\n                    “J”) made it difficult to believe the appellant’s reasons\n                    for choosing the mark “JWest”. This was especially so when there\n                    was a glaring omission on the appellant’s part to mention that its\n                    managing director once distributed shoes under the mark “Jeffery\n                    West” and “JW” for the respondent.107    A finding of bad faith can also be made\n                    where the applicant was aware that someone else intends to use and/or register\n                    the mark, particularly where the applicant has a relationship, for example as\n                    employee or agent, with that other person, or where the applicant has copied a\n                    mark being used abroad with the intention of pre-empting the proprietor who\n                    intends to trade in the specific country, seeDaawat Trade\n                        Mark[2003] RPC 11 at [93]. Similarly, where an\n                    applicant attempts, by means of registration, to seize a trade mark of a third\n                    party with whom he had a contractual or pre-contractual relationship, the\n                    registration would also be found to have been made in bad faith, seeLancome Parfums et Beaute & Cie’s Community Trade Mark\n                        Application[2001] ETMR 89 (“Lancome\n                    Parfums”) at [33].(c)   Where the applicant was aware that a third party had some\n                sort of claim to the goodwill in the mark108    InRothmans of Pall Mall\n                        Ltd v Maycolson International Pte Ltd[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 551 (“Rothmans”),\n                    having regard to the totality of evidence, Lai Siu Chiu J at [36] to [41]\n                    found that various instances of bad faith could be inferred in that case. For\n                    instance, the suspicious circumstances surrounding the incorporation of the\n                    respondent company suggested that it was merely a “shell company”\n                    used by the Hertlein brothers to propagate the use of the\n                    “Fairlight” mark in relation to cigarettes. Moreover, despite a\n                    Europe-wide injunction which at that time prevented the Hertlein brothers from\n                    using the “Fairlight” mark and packaging, they have repeatedly\n                    shown their improper motives to capitalise on the appellant's reputation and\n                    goodwill by their attempt to sidestep the terms of the injunction, as well as by\n                    their persistence in associating themselves with the proprietor's trade marks.\n                    Such an association with the appellants can be seen from the Hertlein\n                    brothers’ lack of candour when explaining their advertising strategies\n                    which blatantly claimed that \"Fairlight\" cigarettes were similar in taste and\n                    packaging to the appellant’s \"Rothmans\" cigarettes or that\n                    “Fairlight” cigarettes resembled the appellant’s \"Rothmans\"\n                    cigarettes.109    Other illustrations of bad faith can be also\n                    be seen inInterkrenn Maschinen Vertriebs GmbH’s\n                        Community Trade Mark[2002] ETMR 27 whereby the\n                    applicant conclusively showed that there was a person who was linked to the\n                    trade mark proprietor and who had obtained knowledge of a planned trade mark of\n                    the applicant during a business meeting. This scenario was dubbed as a classic\n                    case of “trade mark theft”.110    During the course of submissions, parties\n                    were invited to address the court on whether “bad faith” was a\n                    stand-alone, distinct ground of opposition which was independent of attending\n                    confusion or whether a “twin-approach” should be taken (in the\n                    sense that bad faith can be relied upon in order to tilt the balance in deciding\n                    whether there was confusion between the two marks).111    The Appellant submitted that there has to beat leastsome similarity between the two marks\n                    before bad faith can be established, thus alluding to a case of\n                    “copying” of the proprietor’s mark. Alternatively, the\n                    Appellant reiterated Lai J’s decision inRothmansin which it was held at [29] thatdespite the fact that the marks in question are not so similar as to cause\n                        confusion, bad faith can still be established on the\n                    facts.112    As for the Respondent, it maintained that\n                    nothing short of a “distinct proof of unacceptable commercial\n                    behaviour” should warrant a finding of bad faith. This position, however,\n                    seems to be a rather abstract postulation of what the court should do in\n                    determining whether bad faith arose on the facts.113    From the case law discussed above, it\n                    appears that bad faith encompasses “underhand practice involving absence\n                    of good faith on the part of the [trade mark applicant]” (in the words ofLancome Parfumsat [33]. As bad faith is an\n                    “absolute ground for refusal”, this suggests that it is an\n                    independent and distinct ground for refusing the registration of marks in its\n                    own right. As noted by Lai J inRothmans,\n                    this view is consonant with Tan Tee Jim SC’s observations inLaw of Trade Marks and Passing Off in Singapore(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell Asia, 2ndEd, 2005) at paragraph\n                    5.71:Once bad faith is established, the application will be refused, even\n                        though the offending conduct does not cause any confusion or breach any\n                        duty, obligation, prohibition or other legally binding requirement.114    However, the numerous attempts in drawing\n                    the parameters of “bad faith” by various courts are vivid\n                    illustrations of the inherently abstract nature of this concept. The concept of\n                    bad faith is extremely wide in the sense that the courts can infer instances of\n                    bad faith and decide according to the justice of individual cases. Naturally,\n                    the court should also be cautious in not over-extending this concept lest it\n                    becomes a weapon of terror against competitors of trade mark\n                proprietors.115    The categorization byBently & Shermanas seen above hints that despite the broad\n                    nature of the notion of bad faith, one must showsome sort of\n                        nexusbetween the parties in dispute. Otherwise, the notion of\n                    bad faith would have to be decided in vacuum. A clear-cut example of such a\n                    nexus would be an outright copying of the proprietor’s mark such that the\n                    two competing marks are practically identical. However, the nexus may be in the\n                    guise of something more subtle. In finding a nexus between the parties, a\n                    parallel may be drawn between ss 8(2)(b) and\n                    s 7(6) TMA. For example, there may be cases where although there issomesimilarity of marks or of the goods or\n                    services, it falls short of confusing similarity (ie, no likelihood of confusion) within the meaning of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. Nevertheless, the evidence\n                    of this similarity may be taken into account and considered against the\n                    background facts from which bad faith may be inferred. In other words, while the\n                    finding of bad faith is largely, if not invariably, based on circumstantial\n                    evidence, the party alleging bad faith needs to show some link between the\n                    parties, perhaps by way of a pre-existing relationship or some acts of\n                    association with the proprietor or some nexus between the two competing\n                    marks.116    There may be a fine line between being\n                    inspired by another’s trade mark as opposed to blatant copying or copying\n                    with some modifications made to the mark. The former would not attract punitive\n                    measures whereas the latter would lead to the mark being rejected. Where the\n                    dividing line between “inspiration” and\n                    “infringement” should be drawn is a matter best left to the facts\n                    peculiar to any case.Was the Respondent’s registration of “J.ESTINA”\n                made in bad faith?117    The Appellant argued that the lack of\n                    response from the Respondent against the claim of bad faith was far from\n                    satisfactory. Even if the Respondent’s brand story was taken as some sort\n                    of explanation of the derivation of the brand name, it was argued that the brand\n                    story was incapable of holding up against scrutiny. Thus, the only inference was\n                    that the Respondent’s mark was a product of copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark.118    As this was not the first time the parties\n                    have been embroiled in litigation, the Appellant sought to draw the\n                    court’s attention to previous instances of litigation between the\n                    parties:(a)An opposition in South Korea Opposition No.\n                            40-2006-000245 in relation to the Respondent’s other mark\n                            “Estina Donna & Device” which was successfully opposed\n                            by the Appellant;(b)An opposition in relation to Korean Trade Mark\n                            Application No. 2002-0046412 for “J.ESTINA” in respect of\n                            Class 14 which was dismissed as the marks were found to be\n                            dissimilar and no likelihood of confusion was held to\n                        exist;(c)A decision by the Office for Harmonisation in the\n                            Internal Market (“OHIM”) in respect of Opposition No.\n                            B765356 issued on 26 April 2006 in favour of Appellant. The Respondent\n                            submitted that the OHIM had issued its decision based on evidence before\n                            it without having considered any submissions or representations by the\n                            Respondent as it had, for purely commercial reasons, not filed any\n                            observation or response to the Appellant’s opposition. The\n                            Respondent was there seeking to use the mark “JOVANNA\n                            ESTINA” instead of “J.ESTINA” in\n                        Europe;(d)A censure issued by the Arbitration Panel at\n                            Baselworld (Watch and Jewellery Show) on 2 April 2006 which prohibited\n                            the Respondent from using “J.ESTINA” in relation to, among\n                            other things, jewellery, precious stones, horological and chronometric\n                            instruments for the duration of the show. The Respondent submitted that\n                            the Arbitration Panel was an unofficial adjudicating body having no\n                            juridical authority over the parties and its decision should have no\n                            bearing upon the court’s decision here. Further, as the trade show\n                            was for a short duration only, it was simply not expedient to contest\n                            the Appellant’s allegations.As the PAR rightly observed, litigation between the parties in other\n                    jurisdictions serves at best as guides to opposition proceedings here. The\n                    relevance of these decisions will hinge upon the similarity of the laws of the\n                    particular jurisdiction with those of Singapore and also upon the individual\n                    facts of the case, at [118] of GD.119    The Appellant also pointed out that the\n                    Respondent had sought to register the mark “Jovanna Estina” in\n                    Singapore on 20 June 2008 in Trade Mark No. T 0808240Z, in respect of\n                    Class 14 goods. This date fell between the date of notice of opposition\n                    filed by the Appellant (22 September 2006) and the date the GD was rendered\n                    (8 February 2009). The fact that the Respondent thought it necessary to\n                    register an alternative mark in respect of the identical class of goods between\n                    those dates could not be coincidental. The Appellant, by way of Mr. Javier\n                    Ribas’ statutory declaration, submitted that the Respondent’s action\n                    was an indication that it was not confident that it would be able to avoid being\n                    held to be in infringement of the Appellant’s mark “FESTINA”\n                    by its use of “J.ESTINA”.120    In Mr. Myoung-chul Shin’s\n                    statutory declaration, it was said that a commissioned group was set up in order\n                    to come up with a brand name for their jewellery/watch line. A total of 14\n                    European-sounding names were suggested and considered and by process of\n                    elimination, “J.ESTINA” was chosen. A Report on Result of Naming\n                    Research for New Business was made on 1 October 2002 in which\n                    “J.ESTINA” was finally selected, accompanied by a note stating\n                    that “a crown device may be added”. The letter “J”\n                    in “J.ESTINA” was said to have derived from\n                    “Jovanna” who was an Italian princess and Bulgarian queen. This\n                    brand story appears on the Respondent’s website which shows a princess, a\n                    tiara, and her pet car “Jenna”.121    A graphic presentation (in the form of a\n                    mind map) of the various names that were considered, amongst them being\n                    “J.ESTINA”, was also adduced as evidence in the Bundle of\n                    Documents, Volume II Part B. The graphic presentation showed the various factors\n                    that were taken into account in the process of naming,ie, originality, luxury, royal family, targeting consumers\n                    between 25 and 35 years of age. The graphic presentation also showed that the\n                    brand slogan was “Modern Renaissance” and the brand concept was\n                    one of “European Modern Jewellery”. Three graphs were similarly\n                    adduced to show the process of elimination of the other shortlisted13 names and\n                    also the degree of registrability of the final five names.122    In my opinion, the Respondent’s brand\n                    story on the name “J.ESTINA” appears extremely contrived. Firstly,\n                    the use of Princess Jovanna’s name (compressed to “J.”) only\n                    explains the use of the letter “J”. It does not explain why the\n                    meaningless word “ESTINA” was chosen. The six letters in\n                    “ESTINA” are not even the initials of “Jovanna Elizabeth\n                    Antonia Romana Marie” nor do they have any nexus with the tiara or the\n                    pet cat “Jenna” which were repeatedly referred to whenever the\n                    question of derivation of the brand name was raised. The brand story certainly\n                    does not answer any of the queries regarding the derivation of\n                    “ESTINA”. As mentioned at[90]above, giving a European setting to the story merely reinforces the association\n                    between the two competing marks.123    The graphs which supposedly illustrate the\n                    process of ultimately choosing the name “J.ESTINA” also do not\n                    explain in any way how the word “ESTINA” came into being. As the\n                    Respondent has conceded, “ESTINA” is an invented word with no\n                    meaning. The failure to furnish the court with a credible explanation of how\n                    “ESTINA” in the brand name “J.ESTINA” was derived,\n                    where the explanation is particularly pertinent since 6 out of 7 letters are in\n                    identical sequence in the two competing marks, can only lead to the irresistible\n                    conclusion that the word “ESTINA” was blatantly copied from the\n                    Appellant by a “cut and paste” job. The adding of\n                    “J” with a dot just before “ESTINA” makes little\n                    difference to the final name as both words in the competing marks (including the\n                    Appellant’s other marks) would still look alike and sound remarkably\n                    similar whether “J.ESTINA” is pronounced\n                    “jay-estina” (with the “jay” sound likely to be\n                    slurred) or “jes-tina”. Such outright copying of the\n                    Appellant’s mark is an act that falls short of the acceptable commercial\n                    behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the relevant\n                    trade.124    In these circumstances, the\n                    Respondent’s registration of T05/25465Z was undoubtedly made in bad faith.\n                    I therefore have to disagree with the PAR on this issue as well and allow the\n                    Appellant’s objection based on s 7(6) TMA. The Respondent’s\n                    application to register its mark should accordingly be refused.Conclusion125    For the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Appellant’s appeal is allowed on the basis of its opposition based on\n                    s 7(6) and s 8(2)(b) TMA.126    The Respondent is to pay the Appellant the\n                    costs of this appeal which are to be taxed or agreed.127    I thank counsel for both parties for their\n                    written and oral submissions which were of great assistance to me.",
        "Conclusion": "125    For the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Appellant’s appeal is allowed on the basis of its opposition based on\n                    s 7(6) and s 8(2)(b) TMA. 126    The Respondent is to pay the Appellant the\n                    costs of this appeal which are to be taxed or agreed. 127    I thank counsel for both parties for their\n                    written and oral submissions which were of great assistance to me."
