        "Background": "2       The plaintiff is a company registered in Japan.\n                    At all material times, the plaintiff’s shares were equally held by two\n                    companies, Tosho Corporation KK (“Tosho”) and Brother Sales Ltd\n                    (“Brother Sales”). 3       Between 12 February 1991 and 15 August\n                    1994, the plaintiff extended three loans to Tosho and another two loans to a\n                    company affiliated to Tosho and KK Micro Device. During this period, D1 was\n                    a representative director and president of both the plaintiff and Tosho. The\n                    second and third defendants are the brothers of D1 and they held the post of\n                    director of Tosho at different times. 4       The plaintiff started an action in the Tokyo\n                    District Court against the defendants and 3 others as guarantors of the\n                    abovementioned loans (“the first Tokyo litigation”). The Tokyo\n                    District Court allowed the claims and gave judgment for the plaintiff on\n                    11 July 2006, holding that D1 was jointly and severally liable with 3\n                    others for a total sum of ¥1,217,139,001 with interest (“the Tokyo\n                    judgment”). It is common ground that the Tokyo judgment was handed down\n                    after a full trial on its merits. D1’s appeal to the Tokyo High Court was\n                    dismissed on 26 December 2007. His further appeal from the Tokyo High Court\n                    to the Supreme Court of Japan was also dismissed on 18 July 2008. It is not\n                    disputed that there are no further avenues of appeal in Japan against the Tokyo\n                    judgment. The debate here focussed on the question of a re-trial as distinct\n                    from the notion of an appeal. A further point to note is that the plaintiff has\n                    recovered part of the judgment sum and interest. This action was brought to\n                    enforce the Tokyo judgment for the outstanding judgment sum and interest. The\n                    application for summary judgment was filed only against D1 and not the other\n                    defendants. 5       Before the plaintiff brought this action in\n                    Singapore, two other actions were commenced in Japan. One of the actions was\n                    started by D1 in the Nagoya District Court on 3 August 2007 against\n                    the plaintiff and Brother Industries Ltd, the parent company of Brother Sales\n                    (the “Nagoya litigation”). The other action was commenced by the\n                    plaintiff in the Tokyo District Court on 7 November 2007 against D1 and\n                    others (the “second Tokyo litigation”). Both suits were pending in\n                    Japan when this appeal, (“RA 264/2009”), was listed for hearing\n                    before me.",
        "D1’s opposition to summary judgment": "6       D1 resisted the application for summary judgment\n                    on several grounds. Counsel for D1, Mr Nanda Kumar\n                    (“Mr Kumar”), initially raised two arguments before\n                    AR Ang. First, the Tokyo judgment should not be enforced as it was not\n                    final and conclusive. Second, it was against the public policy of Singapore to\n                    enforce the Tokyo judgment which was in respect of transactions that may\n                    subsequently be found to be in violation of the laws of Japan. 7       After AR Ang entered judgment for the plaintiff,\n                    an affidavit was filed on 3 August 2009 on behalf of D1, claiming that one\n                    of the other guarantors who was held to be jointly and severally liable under\n                    the Tokyo judgment, namely KK Sogo Biyou Ikagaku Kenkyujo\n                    (“SBIK”), has an alleged monetary claim against the plaintiff, and\n                    that SBIK has therefore a right to set-off its monetary claim against\n                    SBIK’s joint and several liabilities as guarantor to the plaintiff under\n                    the Tokyo judgment. The argument was that this right to set-off claimed by SBIK\n                    should be used to reduce the judgment sum in the event the plaintiff’s\n                    entitlement to summary judgment stands. Counsel for the plaintiff, Ms Alma\n                    Yong (“Ms Yong”), objected to the late affidavit but she\n                    explained that she had nevertheless filed the plaintiff’s affidavit in\n                    reply on 20 August 2009 so as not to delay the hearing. Given the state of\n                    affairs, I granted leave for both affidavits to be filed and relied upon for the\n                    hearing of RA 264/2009. 8       Mr Kumar raised another new argument in his\n                    written submissions. This argument was not pleaded in the Defence or raised in\n                    any of the affidavits filed on behalf of D1. It was claimed in the written\n                    submissions that D1 had abona fidecounterclaim\n                    in the Nagoya litigation against the plaintiff which constitutes an equitable\n                    set-off. By way of explanation, the Nagoya litigation arose out of a number of\n                    loans made by Brother Sales to the plaintiff, for which D1 had acted as\n                    guarantor. D1 claimed that, as guarantor, he has the right under Japanese law to\n                    obtain in advance reimbursement from the plaintiff, who is the principal debtor\n                    of those loans, even before the principal creditor calls on the loan. The\n                    equitable set-off was allegedly based on D1’s claim for advance\n                    reimbursement in the Nagoya litigation. Mr Kumar argued that D1’s\n                    counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation against the plaintiff was closely\n                    connected with the guarantees upon which the Tokyo judgment was founded so that\n                    it would be unjust for the plaintiff to enforce the Tokyo judgment without\n                    taking into account D1’s counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation against the\n                    plaintiff. D1’s counterclaim in the Nagoya litigation apparently far\n                    exceeded the plaintiff’s claim in the present action against\n                        D1.[note: 1] 9       For the reasons given below, none of the grounds\n                    raised a triable issue. Suffice it to say at this point that D1’s\n                    arguments were built entirely on suppositions rather than from credible facts in\n                    evidence. I also noted that the plaintiff had already enforced the Tokyo\n                    judgment in Japan, and had obtained partial satisfaction of the judgment sum and\n                    interest in 2006. The present action was commenced in Singapore for the\n                    outstanding judgment sum and interest on 20 February 2009.",
        "Enforcement of foreign judgments: the law in general": "10     The law on the enforcement of a foreign\n                    judgment as a debt at common law is well-settled. Foreign judgmentsin personammay be enforced by a claim in proceedings in\n                    Singapore if the foreign judgment is a money judgment of a court of competent\n                    jurisdiction, and that the judgment pronounced by the foreign court is final and\n                    conclusive as between the parties. Moreover, the Singapore court will not\n                    ordinarily reopen the merits of the claim on which the foreign judgment is based\n                    or challenge the factual findings made by the foreign court. The general rule\n                    was restated by the Court of Appeal inHong Pian Tee v Les\n                        Placements Germain Gauthier Inc[2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“Les\n                        Placements”) (at [12]): Quite apart from the arrangements under the RECJA or the REFJA, it is\n                        settled law that a foreign judgmentin\n                            personamgiven by a foreign court of competent jurisdiction\n                        may be enforced by an action for the amount due under it so long as the\n                        foreign judgment is final and conclusive as between the same parties. The\n                        foreign judgment is conclusive as to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and\n                        cannot be impeached for any error, whether of fact or of law:Godard v Gray(1870) LR 6 QB 139. In\n                        respect of such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made\n                        on the ground that the defendant has no defence to the claim:Grant v Easton(1883) 13 QBD 302.\n                        … 11     There are three exceptions to the general rule\n                    on enforcement of a foreign judgment at common law. As the Court of Appeal inLes Placementssaid (at [12]): … The local court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign\n                        judgment if it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its\n                        enforcement would be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in\n                        which the judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice: seeHalsbury's Laws of EnglandVol 8(1)\n                        (Butterworths, 4th Ed) (1996 Reissue) paras 1008-1010. 12     Where an allegation of fraud has already been\n                    raised, argued, and adjudicated upon by a foreign court (as was the case in the\n                    Tokyo judgment), the position in Singapore following the approach taken by\n                    Canadian and Australian cases is that the foreign judgment may be challenged\n                    here in Singapore on the ground of fraud only if fresh evidence has come to\n                    light, and only when the fresh evidence could not have been uncovered with\n                    reasonable diligence at the time of the trial (seeLes\n                        Placementsat [30]). In addition, the fresh evidence must be\n                    of a quality to make a difference to the outcome. D1’s allegation in\n                    paras 9-24 of the Defence that the plaintiff’s claims were tainted by\n                    fraud, deceit and/or mistake were already raised, argued and decided against D1\n                    in the first Tokyo litigation, and on appeal by the Tokyo High Court. D1’s\n                    second argument that the plaintiff’s claims were against public order,\n                    morals, fairness and equitable principles was also, on appeal, rejected by the\n                    Tokyo High Court. D1’s appeal to the Supreme Court of Japan, the final\n                    court of appeal, was dismissed on 18 July 2008.[note: 2]In resisting the application for summary\n                    judgment, D1 was in effect seeking to challenge the factual findings made in the\n                    Tokyo judgment or to reopen the merits of the claims by his argument thatifD1 succeeds in the Nagoya litigation and\n                    the second Tokyo litigation, the findings in the two suits might provide grounds\n                    for a re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation and, hopefully, a revocation of the\n                    Tokyo judgment.[note: 3] 13     I will now deal with D1’s grounds of\n                    opposition advanced by Mr Kumar as triable issues.",
        "Issue 1: The Tokyo judgment was not final": "",
        "The test of finality": "14     Mr Kumar argued that the Tokyo judgment\n                    was not final and conclusive because itmaybe\n                    subject to a re-trial under Article 338(1) sub-paras (vi) or (vii) of the Code\n                    of Civil Procedure (Act No 109 of June 26, 1996) (“CCP”)\n                    (see[19]below). Before I deal with the\n                    question of a re-trial under the CCP, a good starting point is to examine the\n                    test of finality. A summary of this test can be found in Dicey, Morris and\n                    Collins,The Conflict of Laws(Sir Lawrence\n                    Collins gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 14th Ed, 2006) at Vol 1,\n                    para 14-021: The test of finality is the treatment of the judgment by the foreign\n                        tribunal asres judicata. “In order to\n                        establish that [a final and conclusive] judgment has been pronounced, it\n                        must be shown that in the court by which it was pronounced, it conclusively,\n                        finally, and forever established the existence of the debt of which it is\n                        sought to be made conclusive evidence in this country, so as to make itres judicatabetween the parties.”\n                        A foreign judgment which is liable to be abrogated or varied by the court\n                        which pronounced it is not a final judgment. 15     The test makes it necessary to refer to the\n                    foreign law in assessing the finality of the foreign judgment because it would,\n                    in the words of Lord Reid inCarl Zeiss Stiftung v Rayner\n                        & Keeler Ltd (No 2)[1967] 1 AC 853 at\n                    919: … verge on absurdity that we should regard as conclusive something\n                        in a [foreign] judgment which the [foreign] courts themselves would not\n                        regard as conclusive. 16     Furthermore, the test of finality only\n                    requires that the judgment be final and conclusive in the particular court in\n                    which it was pronounced. The fact that the judgment may be altered or varied on\n                    appeal would not render it any less final or conclusive; this much was made\n                    clear in the decision ofNouvion v Freeman(1889)\n                    15 App Cas 1 (“Nouvion”)\n                    (at 13): … In order to its receiving effect here, a foreign decree need not\n                        be final in the sense that it cannot be made the subject of appeal to a\n                        higher Court; but it must be final and unalterable in the Court which\n                        pronounced it; and if appealable the English Court will only enforce it,\n                        subject to conditions which will save the interests of those who have the\n                        right of appeal.",
        "The applicable Japanese law on the question of finality": "17     Tsutomu Kuribayashi, a partner in\n                    M/s Kuribayashi Sogo Law Office, who represented the plaintiff in the first\n                    Tokyo litigation, confirmed in his affidavit filed on 20 May 2009 that\n                    Article 338 of the CCP refers to an application for a re-trial; it does not\n                    allow D1 to file an appeal and there is no further avenue for an appeal against\n                    the Tokyo judgment. Mr Kuribayashi also confirmed that an appeal to the\n                    Supreme Court of Japan is the final appeal, and that the decision of the Supreme\n                    Court of Japan of 18 July 2008 is final and binding regardless of the\n                    outcome of the Nagoya litigation and second Tokyo litigation. The point being\n                    made is that a re-trial is distinct from an appeal to a higher court. D1’s\n                    position is not really different as the affidavits filed on D1’s behalf\n                    referred only to a re-trial under Article 338. 18     Mr Kumar relying on theNouvionsubmitted that the test of finality is simply to\n                    determine whether the foreign judgmentmaybe\n                    abrogated, varied or altered by the same court which made it[note: 4]. According to his notion of the test, the\n                    Tokyo judgment cannot be final and conclusive as it may be subject to a re-trial\n                    by the Tokyo High Court and a subsequent order that the Tokyo judgment be\n                    revoked. 19     It is now a convenient juncture to refer to\n                    the English version of Article 338 which reads as follows: Article 338 (Grounds for Retrial) (1)    Where any of the\n                            following grounds exist, an appeal may be entered by filing an action\n                            for retrial against a final judgment that has become final and binding;\n                            provided, however, that this shall not apply where a party, when filing\n                            the appeal to the court of second instance or final appeal, alleged such\n                            grounds or did not allege them while being aware of them: (i)    The court rendering judgment was not composed\n                                under any Acts.

(iii)   The judgment was made in the absence of the\n                                authority of statutory representation, authority of representation\n                                in a suit or the delegation of powers necessary for performing\n                                procedural acts. (iv)   The judge who participated in making the\n                                judgment has committed a crime in relation to his/her duties with\n                                regard to the case. (v)    Another person's act that is criminally\n                                punishable caused the party to admit any fact or prevented him/her\n                                from advancing allegations or evidence that should have affected a\n                                judgment.

(ix)   There was an omission in a determination with\n                                regard to material matters that should have affected a\n                                judgment. (x)    The judgment pertaining to an appeal conflicts\n                                with a previous judgment that has become final and\n                            binding. (2)    Where any of the grounds set forth in item (iv) to\n                            item (vii) of the preceding paragraph exist, an action for retrial may\n                            be filed only if, with regard to a punishable act, a judgment of\n                            conviction or judgment of a non-penal fine has become final and binding,\n                            or a final and binding judgment of conviction or final and binding\n                            judgment of a non-penal fine cannot be obtained due to grounds other\n                            than grounds of lack of evidence. (3)    When the court of second instance has made a\n                            judgment on merits with regard to the case, no action for retrial may be\n                            filed against the judgment made by the court of first\n                        instance. 20     D1’s contention was that, in the event\n                    that he succeeds in obtaining judgment in either of the actions in the Nagoya\n                    litigation or the second Tokyo litigation, theremaybe grounds for a re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation.\n                    Elaborating, D1 said thatifthere was a finding\n                    that the evidence given in the first Tokyo litigation was false or forged, he\n                    would then be able to rely on such a finding to file for a re-trial of the first\n                    Tokyo litigation pursuant to sub-paras (1)(vi) and/or (1)(vii) of Article\n                        338.[note: 5] 21     Turning to D1’s expert, Professor\n                    Hiroyuki Hirano from Keio Law School of Japan (“Professor Hirano”)\n                    agreed in his affidavit that an action for a re-trial may be filed after final\n                    judgment has been issued in Japan, but his opinion was merely a theoretical one,\n                    and rightly so, given the assumptions he had to make. In his opinion, D1 would\n                    be able to file an action for re-trial of the first Tokyo litigation pursuant to\n                    Article 338 onlyifD1 prevails in the Nagoya\n                    litigation or the second Tokyo litigationandonlyifthere are grounds for a re-trial under\n                    Article 338.[note: 6]In Professor’s Hirano’s own\n                    words: … the only option open to the 1stDefendant now is to wait for the judgment in either the Nagoya litigation or\n                        the 2ndTokyo Litigation… 22     At the time the present action was commenced\n                    in Singapore to enforce the Tokyo judgment, the “option” for a\n                    re-trial in Japan pursuant to Article 338 wasnotavailable at all to D1. As Professor Hirano pointed out, the\n                    “option” was contingent not only upon a successful outcome for D1\n                    in one of the two pending actions in Japan, but also upon there being grounds\n                    for D1 to rely on so that he could fulfil the conditions in Article 338. In\n                    short, D1’s argument that the Tokyo judgment was inconclusive and not\n                    final was premised on an option thatmaybecome\n                    available in the future. The speculative basis underpinning the argument was not\n                    lost on AR Ang, and I agreed with AR Ang that the argument was “premised\n                    on uncertain outcomes of future events”. AR Ang correctly concluded\n                        that:[note: 7] … there was no reason why this court should disregard the\n                        incontrovertible fact that the judgment at hand was issued by a competent\n                        court of foreign jurisdiction, affirmed by the highest appellate court in\n                        Japan and the [first defendant] has not requested for a stay of\n                        execution. 23     I agreed with Ms Yong that the Tokyo\n                    judgment is final and conclusive. In the case ofVanquelin v\n                        Bouard(1863) 15 CB (NS) 341; 143 ER 817 the\n                    defendant there sought to resist, in the Court of Common Pleas, the enforcement\n                    of a French default judgment that could be set aside as soon as the defendant\n                    entered an appearance according to French law. Erle CJ made it clear that\n                    until the defendant took steps to set it aside, the default judgment was final\n                    and conclusive for the purpose of bringing an action in England\n                    (at ER 828): The twelfth plea, to the first count, alleges that the judgment in the\n                        first count mentioned was a judgment by default for want of an appearance by\n                        the defendant in the court of the Tribunal of Commerce, and by the law of\n                        France would become void as of course on an appearance being entered. I\n                        apprehend that every judgment of a foreign court of competent jurisdiction\n                        is valid, and may be the foundation of an action in our courts, though\n                        subject to the contingency, that,by adopting a certain\n                            course, the party against whom the judgment is obtained might cause it\n                            to be vacated or set aside. But, until that course has been pursued, the\n                            judgment remains in full force and capable of being sued\n                        upon. The plaintiff, therefore, must have judgment on the\n                        demurrer to this plea. [emphasis added] 24     In the more recent case ofSchnabel v Lui[2002] NSWSC 15 (“Schnabel”) the Supreme Court of New South Wales\n                    was faced with a question not unlike the one argued in RA 264/2009: whether a\n                    US judgment was final and conclusive despite the existence of a rule in the\n                    United States Code Annotated which allowed for relief from a final judgment to\n                    be granted on specific grounds. After a detailed examination of the authorities,\n                    Bergin J was satisfied that none of the authorities she reviewed stood for\n                    the bare proposition that just because a judgment could be varied or altered by\n                    the same court that made it, it must therefore follow that the judgment was\n                    inconclusive and not final. Rather, Bergin J was of the opinion that the\n                    party’s ability to apply to have a judgment set aside was immaterial. What\n                    was crucial in Bergin J’s opinion was that the US judgment wasres judicatain the US courts as between the\n                    partiesuntil it was set aside(Schnabelat para [133]): Nouvion v FreemanandVanquelin v Bouardare authorities for the proposition thatthe test of finality is how the foreign jurisdiction\n                            treats the judgment. The evidence in this case is overwhelming that the\n                            foreign jurisdiction treats the judgment as a final judgment and that it\n                            is res judicata the issues between the parties to the\n                            litigation. The effect that an application under Rule 60 (b)\n                        may have on the finality of the US Judgment is expressly dealt with in the\n                        Rule. It sates [sic]: \"A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect\n                        the finality of a judgment or suspend its operation\". [emphasis added] 25     Furthermore, the decision ofNouvioncited by Mr Kumar is distinguishable given\n                    the nature of the foreign judgment in question. The plaintiff there had sought\n                    to enforce what was known as a remate judgment obtained in Spain through\n                    executive or summary proceedings which only allowed a defendant to raise a\n                    limited number of defences. Even after a remate judgment was granted, either\n                    party would be at liberty to bring plenary or ordinary proceedings in order to\n                    re-litigate the case on the merits and raise all legal defences. Crucially, the\n                    remate judgment could not be relied upon as a defence in the plenary proceedings\n                    and the House of Lords went on to hold that the remate judgment was not final.\n                    Lord Herschell concluded that (Nouvionat\n                    11): … the plaintiff in such a suit, an executive suit, is not, by the\n                        decision which is now under appeal, deprived of his rights. He may still sue\n                        upon the original cause of action. Of course it may happen, as in this\n                        particular case, that such a suit is barred by lapse of time, but that is an\n                        accident.The right of the plaintiff to sue on his\n                            original cause of action is not at all interfered with by the judgment\n                            which has been pronounced; and in such an action, if it were brought,\n                            all questions upon which the rights of the parties depend, and by the\n                            solution of which the obligation to pay must ultimately be determined,\n                            would be open to considerationand could be dealt with by the\n                        Courts, and finally and conclusively settled. I do not, therefore, see that\n                        there is any wrong or any hardship done by holding that a judgment which\n                        does not conclusively and for ever as between the parties establish the\n                        existence of a debt in that Court cannot be looked upon as sufficient\n                        evidence of it in the Courts of this country. [emphasis added] 26     The Tokyo judgment was clearly different in\n                    character from the remate judgment inNouvion. In\n                    contrast, in the present case, the affidavit evidence confirmed that if a party\n                    in Japan were to apply for a re-trial under Article 338, he would have to first\n                    rely on one of the specific grounds in Article 338(1) and not on his original\n                    cause of action which had been heard and determined in earlier\n                    proceedings. 27     A related but separate point raised by\n                    Ms Yong is that the plaintiff had already enforced, unconditionally, the\n                    Tokyo judgment in Japan before the present action was commenced in Singapore. It\n                    was certainly not D1’s case that the Tokyo judgment was unenforceable in\n                    Japan, and it would be difficult to imagine on what basis D1 could resist\n                    enforcement in Japan when, as already mentioned, his case was simply that the\n                    option to apply for a re-trial might be available to him in the future. Until\n                    that happened, the Tokyo judgment remained binding and enforceable in Japan as\n                    between the parties. Beingres judicatabetween\n                    the parties, the Toyko judgment quite clearly passed the test of finality as\n                    pronounced in the authorities already discussed. In any event, the evidence on\n                    Japanese law on the nature of the Tokyo judgment was not disputed between the\n                    parties and that was sufficient for me to arrive at a conclusion as to the\n                    finality of the Tokyo judgment.",
        "Issue 2: D1’s claim that enforcement of the Tokyo judgment was\n                against the public policy of Singapore": "28     D1 argued that the courts in the Nagoya\n                    litigation and the second Tokyo litigation might find that the guarantees at\n                    issue in those cases were against the public order, morals or fair and equitable\n                    principles of law in Japan. Following that assumption, D1 advanced the argument\n                    that any such findingcould raise the implicationthat the Tokyo judgment was also founded on guarantees that were similarly in\n                    breach of public order or principles of law in Japan, and that to allow the\n                    plaintiff to enforce the Tokyo judgment under such circumstances would be\n                    against the public policy of Singapore. Again, these arguments were premised on\n                    the pious hope that the Nagoya litigation and the second Tokyo litigation would\n                    be concluded in D1’s favour and a chance of a re-trial of the first Tokyo\n                    litigation if there were findings that satisfy the grounds in Article\n                    338. 29     As Ms Yong rightly pointed out, there is\n                    nobona fideissue that the Tokyo judgment would\n                    be against public policy in this country and that it, therefore, could not be\n                    enforced. The question of whether the guarantees in the first Tokyo litigation\n                    were “against the public order, morals, or fair and equitable principles\n                    of law in Japan” had already been raised, argued and decided in favour of\n                    the plaintiff by the Tokyo High Court.",
        "Issue 3: D1’s claim against the plaintiff in a separate action\n                gave him an equitable set-off against the plaintiff’s action": "30     At the hearing of RA 264/2009, Mr Kumar\n                    argued that unconditional leave to defend should be granted because of\n                    D1’s counterclaim against the plaintiff which constitutes an equitable\n                        set-off.[note: 8]I have alluded to this argument\n                    in[8]above. Mr Kumar explained that\n                    the counterclaim was based on D1’s claim that, under Japanese law, a\n                    guarantor of a loan has the right to obtain an advance reimbursement from the\n                    principal debtor (ie. the plaintiff) even before\n                    the creditor calls on the loan. 31     In response, Ms Yong said that the\n                    equitable set-off argument was not pleaded in the Defence or raised in the\n                    affidavits. There was no affidavit evidence regarding this alleged right of\n                    advance reimbursement under Japanese law. Apart from Ms Yong’s valid\n                    objections, D1 was no doubt seeking to avail himself of a counterclaim that was\n                    not brought in proceedings before me to argue set off in equity or otherwise.\n                    This was a wrong-headed argument that essentially assumed that a counterclaim\n                    pending in foreign proceedings could be introduced in such a manner in order to\n                    obtain unconditional leave to defend. Any set-off (assuming it was arguable)\n                    must be in respect of a counterclaim filed by D1 in the proceedings here. As\n                    Ms Yong pointed out, D1’s pleadings did not aver to any set off by\n                    way of counterclaim in the Singapore proceedings. D1 also did not adduce any\n                    affidavit evidence of an arguable equitable set-off in the Singapore proceedings\n                    that was connected with any of the three exceptions to the general rule on\n                    enforcement of a foreign judgment at common law (see[11]above).",
        "Issue 4: D1’s claim that he was entitled to reduce the judgment\n                sum based on a right to set-off between the plaintiff and SBIK": "32     Mr Kumar’s fall back argument was\n                    that any summary judgment in favour of the plaintiff ought to be reduced from\n                    ¥833,793,333 (that being the outstanding judgment sum) to\n                        ¥823,293,333[note: 9], on the basis that one of the other\n                    guarantors, SBIK, who was also found liable to the plaintiff under the Tokyo\n                    judgment, has filed a “Notice of Set-off” against the plaintiff in\n                        Japan.[note: 10] 33     Ms Yong explained that SBIK’s claim\n                    was already time-barred, but notwithstanding that legal impediment, SBIK had not\n                    raised this alleged set-off in the Tokyo litigation. Be that as it may, any\n                    set-off between SBIK and the plaintiff is wholly distinct and separate from the\n                    plaintiff’s action to enforce the Tokyo judgment here in Singapore against\n                    D1. To raise this set-off as a triable issue, D1 would have to show that it\n                    could properly avail itself of SBIK’s set-off. Mr Kumar cited two\n                    authorities, namely the English Court of Appeal decision ofUnited Overseas Limited v Peter Robinson Limited (trading as Top\n                        Shop)(CA Transcript 91/0297, March 26 1991, unreported) andHawley & Hazel Chemical Co (S) Pte Ltd v Szu Ming\n                        Trading Pte Ltd[2008] SGHC 13 in argument. Those\n                    authorities do not assist D1 as they deal with an equitable set-off as between a\n                    plaintiff and a defendant in the same summary proceedings. There is nothing in\n                    those authorities that suggests that a defendant could raise a defence of\n                    equitable set-off in summary proceedings based on a right to set-off between the\n                    plaintiff and another non-party. In any case, as Mr Yong rightly pointed\n                    out, in an action to enforce a foreign judgment, the exceptions to the general\n                    rule are fraud, public policy reasons and breach of natural justice. Set-off as\n                    such is not a recognised exceptionper se. This\n                    same point is relevant and also applies in answer to issue 3\n                above.",
