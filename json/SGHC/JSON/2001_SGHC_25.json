        "The defence": "48. Two lines of defence were raised, first that he had acted under grave and\n\nsudden provocation and second that the accused did not have the requisite intention to commit the\n\noffence of murder.Evaluation of the defenceGrave and sudden provocation49. Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code provides thatCulpable homicide is not murder if the offender whilst deprived of the power of\n\n  self-control by grave and sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the\n\n  provocation, or causes the death of any other person by mistake or accident.50. In the closing submissions counsel identified the provocation asi the victim had molested the Accused's girlfriend earlier;ii confronted the Accused in a threatening manner;iii the victim exhibited a hostile persona towards the Accused when the Accused\n\n  wanted to fetch his girlfriend back home;iv the victim's physical presence, gestures and stares at the Accused51. I considered them individually and collectively. The alleged molestation had\n\nceased before the accused arrived at the coffee shop. The accused said that the deceased stared at\n\nhim, and he stared back at the deceased. The act that precipitated the assault was the deceased\n\nraising his hand as though to hit him. This was not consistent with the accused's statement that\n\n\"Before the Malay man (deceased) could make any move, I immediately hit him with the wooden\n\nplank\", and his answer when asked whether the deceased posed any harm or threat to him, that\n\n\"His behaviour towards my girlfriend and the way he stared hard at me made me felt\n\nfrightened\" with no mention of any gestures, hand or arm movements. The defence had not shown\n\nthat there was a grave and sudden provocation.52. The evidence showed that he was angry with the deceased for accosting his\n\ngirlfriend and annoyed at her for not leaving the coffee shop with him immediately. He did not say\n\nthat he was so provoked that he had lost his self-control when he attacked the deceased. The defence\n\nhad also not shown that the accused had lost self-control.53. Counsel submitted not only that there was provocation, but also that it is\n\nunnecessary to consider the provocation against the accused's actions. Counsel citedPP v Kwan\n\nCin Cheng[1998] 2 SLR 345for that purpose. In that case, the court considered the\n\n\"proportionality\" requirement stated inVijayan v PP[1975] 2 MLJ 8,[1975-1977] SLR 100. It recognised that there are degrees of loss of self-control, then went on to state at\n\nparagraph 69 thatNonetheless, it must be recognised thatwhere the provocation defence in\n\n  Exception 1 to s 300 is concerned, the accused's loss of self-control would ex hypothesi always\n\n  have been of an extreme degree, resulting in the killing of another person. In practice, an\n\n  inquiry into 'proportionality' does little to answer the essential question of whether an ordinary\n\n  person would, upon receiving the provocation in question, have lost his self control to this\n\n  extent and reacted as the accused did. (Emphasis added)54.Kwan Cin Chengand the provocation defence were discussed inLau\n\nLee Peng v PP[2000] 2 SLR 628, where it was said at paragraph 31 -(The) proportionality test suggests that the retaliation taken must be\n\n  commensurate with the provocation offered which caused the accused to lose his self-control:N\n\n  Govindasamy v PP[1975-1977] SLR 165;[1976] 2 MLJ 49;Wo Yok Ling v PP[1978-1979] SLR 78;[1979] 1 MLJ 101andKoh Swee Beng v PP[1991] SLR 319;[1991] 3 MLJ 401. In the light\n\n  of the discussion inKwan Cin Cheng, the test of proportionality is probably not a distinct\n\n  requirement for raising the defence of provocation. It is a factor to be taken into account in\n\n  determining whether the objective test of gravity and suddenness is fulfilled. Therefore,the\n\n  fact that the retaliatory acts may have been out of proportion to the provocation offered does not\n\n  necessarily mean that the defence must fail. This is becausewhere the provocation defence\n\n  in Exception 1 to s 300 is raised, the accused's acts of retaliation would ex hypothesi always\n\n  have been of an extreme degree, resulting in the death of another person.An inquiry into\n\n  'proportionality' does little to answer the essential question of whether an ordinary person\n\n  would, upon receiving the provocation in question, have reacted in the same way the accused did.\n\n  (Emphasis added)55. The notion of self-control of an extreme degree in the context of Exception 1\n\nmerits further consideration. While Exception 1 applies only to the offence of murder, the offence\n\ncovers not one, but four classes of acts.56. Section 300 provides thatExcept in the cases hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder -(a) if the act by which the death is caused is done with the intention of\n\n    causing death;(b) if it is done with the intention of causing such bodily injury as the\n\n    offender knows to be likely to cause the death of the person to whom the harm is caused;(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any person,\n\n    and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n\n    cause death; or(d) if the person committing the act knows that it is so imminently dangerous\n\n    that it must in all probability cause death, or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death,\n\n    and commits such act without any excuse or incurring the risk of causing death, or such injury\n\n    as aforesaid.57. A person commits murder if he (a) causes death with the intention to cause\n\ndeath (b) causes death by intentionally causing such bodily injury as he knows to be likely to cause\n\ndeath, (c) causes death by intentionally causing bodily injury which is sufficient in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature to cause death, or (d) does an act which he knows is so imminently dangerous that\n\nit must in all probability cause death or such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, with no\n\nrequirement for any intention on his part to cause death or bodily injury.58. When a person is faced with a grave and sudden provocation and is deprived of\n\nself-control, the degree of his loss of self-control would vary according to the provocation. An\n\nextreme provocation may cause him to lose all self-control. A less severe provocation may cause him\n\nto lose some, but not all self-control. In the first case the defence under Exception 1 may be\n\navailable if he intentionally killed the person provoking him. In the second situation, that defence\n\nmay not be available if he killed intentionally, but it may be available if death was caused by a\n\ndangerous act coming within s 300(d).59. Even if the response to a provocation in a case of murder isex hypothesialways\n\nof an extreme degree, it is still necessary to determine whether it is commensurate with the\n\nprovocation. As noted inKwan Cin Chengat paragraph 44,there are two distinct requirements for the provocation defence to apply:\n\n  first, a 'subjective' requirement that the accused was deprived of his self-control by\n\n  provocation; and secondly, an 'objective' requirement that the provocation should have been 'grave\n\n  and sudden'.A subjective evaluation should be made taking into account the provocation the\n\nperson received, his condition and circumstances, and his response. The defence will not succeed if\n\nthe response is found to be excessive to the provocation.60. I found that even if there was provocation, the accused's actions were out of\n\nall proportion to it and did not come within Exception 1 as the deceased had not quarrelled with him\n\nor laid a finger on him.Lack of intention61. Defence counsel relied on s 86(2) of the Penal Code which provides thatIntoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining whether\n\n  the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence of which he\n\n  would not be guilty of the offence.62. The accused testified that he was not completely drunk and was aware of the\n\nsurroundings. Nothing in the evidence indicated that he was so drunk that he could not have the\n\nintention to commit an offence under s 300. He was in control of his faculties - he asked Bok Swee\n\nHoon to leave with him, he looked for and armed himself with a pole and used it to teach the\n\ndeceased a lesson.63. Counsel referred toPP v Teo Heng Chye[1989] SLR 659where the\n\naccused who was charged with murder was convicted on a reduced charge of culpable homicide not\n\namounting to murder. In that case the trial judges held at p 663 \"  we decided that the\n\ndegree of intoxication was such that (the accused) could not have formed any of the intentions for\n\nmurder.\" That finding on the facts of that case has no application to the present case, and\n\ndoes not assist the accused.64. After considering the evidence and the injuries inflicted on the defenceless\n\ndeceased, I found that intention under s 300(c) was established.65. I therefore convicted the accused on the charge he faced.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright Â© Government of Singapore."
