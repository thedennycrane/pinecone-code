        "The case for the prosecution": "4        At the trial below, the prosecution led\n\nevidence from six witnesses through conditioned statements as well as by oral testimony.\n\nThe most crucial evidence against the appellant came from PW1 Saravanan A/L Kaliannan\n\n(\"Saravanan\") and PW3 Kumar s/o Srinivasan (\"Kumar\").",
        "Saravanan’s statements": "5        At the material time, Saravanan was working\n\nin Seagate Technology International (\"Seagate\") as an assistant technician. His\n\njob scope included the operation of a sputter machine (used to sputter media discs used in\n\nthe production of hard disks). As part of his job, he was in charge of sending the used\n\ntargets to the vendor to be reclaimed. The vendor to Seagate at the material time was\n\nHeraeus Precision Engineering Pte Ltd (\"Heraeus\").6        Saravanan testified that, sometime in March\n\n2001, the appellant had contacted him and asked him to steal used platinum targets from\n\nSeagate, which would then be shipped to Japan. The appellant promised to pay Saravanan\n\n$250 for each target. At this point, Saravanan refused to take part in the scheme.7        Two days later, the appellant approached\n\nSaravanan with the same suggestion. Instead, Saravanan came up with a counter proposal and\n\noffered to sell to the appellant two used platinum targets from another manufacturer,\n\nTosoh (\"‘Tosoh’ targets\") which he had misappropriated sometime in\n\nNovember 2000. The appellant agreed to buy the ‘Tosoh’ targets for $200 each and\n\nthe two arranged to meet up in two days’ time at the Woodlands Central\n\nMcDonald’s restaurant.8        At the meeting, the appellant accepted the\n\ntwo ‘Tosoh’ targets and paid Saravanan $400. (It was agreed at trial that the\n\nvalue of each of these ‘Tosoh’ targets referred to in DAC 57462/2001 was\n\nUS$3,500 each.) On this occasion, the appellant once again brought up the idea of stealing\n\nused Heraeus targets. Saravanan stated that the appellant managed to convince him that he\n\n(Saravanan) would not get caught, so Saravanan agreed to the plan.9        A week later, the appellant called\n\nSaravanan at work and asked if there were extra targets for him. Saravanan confirmed that\n\nthere were and the appellant went to Seagate. Two used targets were passed over to him.\n\nSaravanan stated that subsequently he would pass the used Heraeus targets to Kumar,\n\nHeraeus’s driver. On these occasions, he would get a white envelope from Kumar, which\n\ncontained money that the appellant had asked Kumar to pass to him.10        Sometime in November 2001, when it became\n\nevident to Seagate that targets had been stolen, Saravanan met the appellant at one\n\nFarmart Seafood Restaurant where Saravanan was paid a final $1,000 and was assured by the\n\nappellant that all the targets had been shipped to Japan.11        Saravanan pleaded guilty to the charge of\n\ncommitting criminal breach of trust as a servant by dishonestly misappropriating 48 used\n\nplatinum targets. He was convicted on 4 March 2002 and sentenced to four years’\n\nimprisonment. Another charge of criminal misappropriation of two ‘Tosoh’ used\n\nplatinum targets was taken into consideration. Saravanan was serving sentence when he gave\n\nevidence for the prosecution against the appellant.",
        "Kumar’s statements": "12        At the material time, Kumar was a driver\n\nfor Heraeus. His job scope at that time included sending new targets to, and collecting\n\nused targets from, Seagate. He gave evidence that from around March 2001, Saravanan would\n\ngive him a few used targets that were not registered or recorded in the returned targets\n\ninvoice. He also gave evidence that on some of these occasions, the appellant would inform\n\nhim just before the collection that there would be targets for experiments and that he was\n\nto collect them from Saravanan.13        He stated that he made about ten such\n\ntrips where he collected used targets that were not registered or recorded in the returned\n\ntarget invoice. On each occasion, there would be between two to four such extra targets.14        More importantly, he stated that on a few\n\noccasions, before he left for Seagate, the appellant would pass him a white envelope\n\nbearing the company’s letterhead and that the appellant instructed him on these\n\noccasions to hand over the envelope to the appellant. He stated that he delivered them to\n\nSaravanan as he was told.15        Kumar stated that, upon returning to the\n\noffice from such trips, he would deliver the used targets either to the storeman, one\n\nThanabal, or to the appellant personally. He also stated that on two such occasions, upon\n\nreturning to the office with the used targets, the appellant taught him how to weigh the\n\nused targets. The appellant then asked him to switch them with heavier used targets\n\n(scheduled to be returned to the United States) which had been properly recorded in the\n\ninvoice. However, he could not remember exactly how many of such targets he had switched\n\non the appellant’s instructions.16        Sometime in October 2001, Kumar received a\n\nphone call from the appellant while he was in the office. He stated that the appellant\n\ntold him to take six pieces of the used targets which the appellant was keeping under the\n\ntable and to put them on the false ceiling in his office. When asked why he needed to do\n\nthis, the appellant told Kumar that he did not want the representatives from Seagate to\n\nfind out that the six targets were in the company.Statements from other witnesses17        Apart from Saravanan and Kumar, three\n\nother prosecution witnesses gave evidence which implicated the appellant. PW6 Tan Wee Kiat\n\n(\"Tan\"), a Seagate investigator, gave evidence that he lodged a police report on\n\n30 November 2001 when he noticed that there were 48 used targets missing from\n\nSeagate’s inventory. PW7 Senior Investigating Office Javier Neo (\"Neo\") was\n\nassigned to the case. On 3 December 2001, Neo was informed by Kumar that the appellant had\n\ninstructed him to hide the six platinum targets in the false ceiling. Neo acted on the\n\ninformation and raided the Heraeus office where the six targets were recovered. Tan\n\nconfirmed that the serial numbers of these six targets matched those of the platinum\n\ntargets missing from Seagate.18        PW2 Perabu A/L Natarajan\n\n(\"Perabu\") gave evidence that the appellant had asked him to photocopy\n\ncertificates of analysis for the used targets which had been collected. It was also\n\nPerabu’s evidence that this was not the usual practice. The prosecution also adduced\n\nevidence from PW4 Krishnamoorthy Ramesh (\"Ramesh\") who gave evidence that\n\nsometime in October 2001, when the Seagate investigators had asked for documents\n\npertaining to the lost platinum targets, the appellant asked him to cover all the pen\n\nmarkings on the used target logsheets before photocopying them. He also confirmed that the\n\nused platinum targets were handed directly to the appellant on a number of occasions. Tan\n\nstated that, had he seen the handwritten markings on the used target logsheets which\n\nRamesh was asked to cover up, he would have immediately concluded that someone in Heraeus\n\nwas involved in the theft.",
        "The defence": "19        The appellant’s defence on both\n\ncharges in the court below was that he was not the mastermind of the conspiracy. Rather,\n\nhe was merely carrying out the instructions of his superior, one Ramachandran Viswanathan\n\n(\"Ram\"). Ram was a director of Heraeus at the material time. In his\n\nexamination-in-chief, he alleged that he met with Saravanan at the McDonald’s\n\nrestaurant on instruction from Ram. However, he did not call on Ram to give evidence to\n\nsupport his case.20        He also denied that he had called\n\nSaravanan at the latter’s office to check on the quantity of used targets for\n\ncollection. He insisted that the standard procedure was for Seagate to send an e-mail to\n\nHeraeus regarding the number of targets to be collected. Hence, there was no need for him\n\nto call Saravanan. However, he admitted that he was aware of used targets being taken out\n\nby Saravanan and being passed to Heraeus but he alleged once again that this was done on\n\nthe instruction of Ram.21        As for his conduct vis--vis Kumar, he\n\nadmitted that he did ask Kumar to weigh the used targets and to switch the heavier ones\n\nmeant to be shipped to the US and replace them with lighter ones passed over by Saravanan.\n\nYet again, he alleged that he did this on the instructions of Ram, who was not called to\n\nsubstantiate his allegations.22        As for explaining why he had asked Kumar\n\nto move the six targets to the false ceiling, he claimed that that was done on the\n\ninstructions of his new boss, one Dan Holland. As was the case with Ram, the appellant did\n\nnot call Dan Holland as a witness. More importantly, he failed to mention the Dan\n\nHolland’s involvement in this episode in his statement to the police. When asked to\n\nexplain his inconsistency during cross-examination, he said that he had lied to the police\n\nin his earlier statement because he was under a Non-Disclosure Agreement with the company\n\nand he did not want to reveal anything which might be in contravention of that agreement.23        The appellant called on DW2 Veeravalli\n\nRaghavan (\"Raghavan\"), a director of Nishtha Engineering Pte Ltd, a company\n\ndealing with electrical and electronic components. He gave evidence that he had received\n\n42 used targets from Ram and that Ram had given him instructions to cut those targets into\n\nsmaller parts. However, he gave evidence to the effect that he did not check the serial\n\nnumbers of the targets that Ram had handed over to him. The appellant’s contention\n\nwas that these 42 targets were the ones which had been stolen from Seagate.24        However, during cross-examination of\n\nRaghavan, the DPP sought to admit a list (obtained from Heraeus’ records) containing\n\nthe serial numbers of the 42 targets that had been handed over to Raghavan. This list was\n\nadmitted without objection from defence counsel. It was the DPP’s submission that\n\nnone of those serial numbers matched those that were missing from Seagate. As such, the 48\n\ntargets handed over to Raghavan could not have been part of the 48 stolen targets.",
        "The decision of the trial judge below": "25        In examining Saravanan’s statements,\n\nthe trial judge was mindful of the fact that Saravanan was an accomplice and thus\n\nscrutinised his statement with caution. He conceded that there were some inconsistencies\n\nin Saravanan’s statements but found these inconsistencies to be minor and that they\n\ndid not discredit his entire evidence. He noted that Saravanan had already been dealt with\n\nfor the offences that he had committed. He also observed that the defence did not advance\n\nreasons as to why Saravanan should implicate the appellant if what Saravanan had stated\n\nwas not the truth. On those two counts, he accepted the evidence of Saravanan.26        He also chose not to accept the\n\nappellant’s defence. He found difficulty in accepting various parts of his evidence\n\nin cross-examination where he merely gave a series of ‘I do not know’ answers to\n\npertinent questions. For example, he was asked whether it would be very suspicious for an\n\nassistant technician like Saravanan to sell two used Tosoh targets to him without any\n\nproper documentation. His reply was, \"I do not know.\" He noted that the\n\nappellant was not a nave person but was an experienced person in this line of business.\n\nThus, the trial judge found his ambivalent answers to be a mere pretence in an attempt to\n\navoid answering those questions. More importantly, he found that although the appellant\n\nhad claimed that he was acting on the instructions of Ram and Dan Holland, he did not call\n\nthem to substantiate his bare allegations.27        Consequently, he convicted the appellant\n\non both charges and sentenced him to a total of six and a half years imprisonment after\n\ntaking into account the appellant’s mitigation plea. The notes of evidence showed\n\nthat the trial judge took into account the following factors in sentencing the appellant:(a)    The seriousness of the offences committed by the appellant and\n\n    the penalty prescribed by law for such offences;(b)    The facts of the case as revealed by the evidence, including the\n\n    nature and the value of the property involved and the period over which the offences were\n\n    committed;(c)    The six charges taken into consideration for the purposes of\n\n    sentence;(d)    The sentence meted out to his accomplice, Saravanan;(e)    The mitigation plea made by counsel, in particular that the\n\n    appellant had no antecedents;(f)    That the appellant appeared to be the mastermind of the\n\n    conspiracy and that he did not appear to be remorseful for what he had done during the\n\n    conduct of his defence. Moreover, he noted that the appellant blamed his company’s\n\n    management for his various activities.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "28        Counsel for the appellant raised\n\nthe following issues on appeal against conviction:(a)    Whether the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that\n\n    Saravanan dishonestly appropriated 48 pieces of used Heraeus targets as stated in the\n\n    charge;(b)    Whether the trial judge had erred both in law and in fact in his\n\n    finding that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Saravanan to commit criminal\n\n    breach of trust; and(c)    Whether the prosecution failed to prove that the 48 targets which\n\n    were stolen were entrusted to Saravanan.(d)    As for the second charge, whether the trial judge had erred in\n\n    law by failing to give the appellant the benefit of doubt since it was Ram who gave\n\n    instructions for the collection of the stolen targets from Seagate.",
        "Whether the prosecution had proven the exact number of targets in the\n\ncharge beyond reasonable doubt": "29        Counsel argued that the prosecution\n\ndid not manage to prove all 48 targets had been misappropriated. He painstakingly tried to\n\nshow that, from the statements of the witnesses, nobody could be sure that there were\n\nexactly 48 targets involved in the whole transaction. For example, he pointed out that\n\nKumar, in his oral evidence, said that the total number of targets could have been about\n\n35.30        I was of the view that the discrepancy\n\ninvolved here was immaterial. This was particularly so because Saravanan, the principal\n\noffender, in his cautioned statement, stated:In total I have stolenat least 40used platinum\n\n    targets from the company andI had sold all of them to Amir[the accused].\n\n    (emphasis added)31        I was also mindful of the fact that\n\nSaravanan, the principal offender, had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 408 of the Penal\n\nCode involving exactly 48 targets. This was very strong evidence that the number of\n\ntargets in the charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt. Further, the defence did\n\nnot raise any evidence both here and in the trial below to show that some of those 48\n\ntargets had been passed to a person other than the appellant. Therefore, I rejected this\n\nargument from the appellant’s counsel and found that the prosecution had proven the\n\nnumber of targets in the charge beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "Whether the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with Saravanan to\n\ncommit criminal breach of trust": "32        Next, counsel argued that the trial judge\n\nerred in law and in fact in finding that the appellant had engaged in a conspiracy with\n\nSaravanan to commit criminal breach of trust. For this argument, he relied on a number of\n\ncontentions.",
        "Whether the appellant had to be the mastermind of the conspiracy": "33        First, he tried to show that the appellant\n\nwas not the mastermind of the conspiracy but merely carrying out the instructions of Ram.\n\nHe relied on the evidence from Kumar where he stated that on one of the occasions, he had\n\npassed the targets to Ram instead of the appellant.34        I found this contention to be\n\nunmeritorious. For the charge of abetting Saravanan in committing criminal breach of trust\n\nby conspiracy, the prosecution had to establish the following elements under s 107(b) of\n\nthe Penal Code:(a)    the person abetting must engage with one or more\n\n    other persons in a conspiracy;(b)    the conspiracy must be for the doing of the thing\n\n    abetted; and(c)    an act or illegal omission must take place in\n\n    pursuance of the conspiracy.Section 107(b) of the Penal Code not require the accused person to be\n\nthe mastermind before a charge for abetment by conspiracy can be proved. The fact that the\n\nappellant may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant.35        In any case, I found that the allegations\n\nthat Ram was the mastermind to be completely unsubstantiated. The appellant did not call\n\nRam as a witness to support his allegation and the trial judge was correct in disbelieving\n\nthe appellant’s allegations in the absence of corroboration from Ram. I saw no reason\n\nto disturb that finding.",
        "Accomplice evidence": "36        Counsel proceeded to argue that\n\nSaravanan’s testimony was highly unbelievable and should not form the basis of the\n\nappellant’s conviction. I found that there was little merit in this argument as well.\n\nAn issue arose here because Saravanan was the appellant’s accomplice. However, I\n\nfound that the trial judge’s approach to Saravanan’s testimony was beyond\n\nreproach.37        The law on the treatment of evidence ofaccomplices in Singapore is very well settled. InTan Hung Yeoh v PP[1999] 3 SLR 93, I held that the court may convict an accused person based on the uncorroborated\n\nevidence of anaccomplice: see, for example,Chua Poh Kiat\n\nAnthony v PP[1998] 2 SLR 713andKwang Boon Keong Peter v PP[1998] 2 SLR 592.\n\nThe corroboration warning against an accomplice's evidence is no longer mandatory in law:\n\ns 135 Evidence Act (Cap 97). All that the court is required to do is to treat the evidence\n\nof anaccomplicewith caution as theaccomplicemay,\n\nnot must, be presumed to be unworthy of credit: see s 116 illustration (b) Evidence Act\n\nandChua Poh Kiat Anthony v PP,Kwang Boon Keong\n\nPeter v PP.38        Here, it was evident that the trial judge\n\nhad cautioned himself that Saravanan was an accomplice and he had meticulously perused the\n\nevidence before him before coming to the conclusion to believe Saravanan’s testimony.\n\nIt is trite law that an appellate court will not disturb a trial judge’s findings of\n\nfact, particularly when they are based on the assessment of credibility of witnesses. This\n\nis so because the appellate court does not have the opportunity of examining the\n\nwitnesses: seeArts Niche Cyber Distribution Pte Ltd v PP[1999] 4 SLR 111.\n\nFurther, I could see no reason or incentive for Saravanan to implicate the appellant in a\n\nbid to reduce his own complicity in the affair. Before the appellant’s trial,\n\nSaravanan had pleaded guilty to a charge under s 408 of the Penal Code and was sentenced\n\nto four years’ imprisonment. At the time of the appellant’s trial, Saravanan\n\ngave evidence while he was serving his sentence. Like the trial judge, I could see no\n\nreason to disbelieve his testimony and I rejected counsel’s argument on this ground.",
        "Whether the targets sold to Raghavan by Ram could have been part of the\n\n48 misappropriated targets": "39        Next, counsel sought to distance the\n\nappellant from the crime by asking the court to draw an inference that the 42 targets\n\nwhich Ram sold to Raghavan for cutting formed part of the 48 targets that had been\n\nmisappropriated from Seagate. I saw no merit in this argument. This argument was highly\n\nspeculative and counsel adduced no evidence to substantiate the veracity of his\n\nallegation.40        On the contrary, the prosecution adduced a\n\nlist of serial numbers of targets that had been sold to Raghavan from Heraeus’\n\nrecords (Exhibit P24). Raghavan testified that P24 was indeed a list of serial numbers of\n\nthe targets that had been sold to his company but he stated that he did not check to see\n\nif the serial numbers of the targets matched those that were given in the list. The\n\nprosecution then pointed out that none of the serial numbers in P24 matched those of the\n\ntargets that were missing from Seagate. I found the evidence adduced by the prosecution in\n\nP24 to be sufficiently convincing to rebut the inference that counsel sought to draw.41        Further, counsel tried to argue that the\n\nlist in P24 contained a list of fictitious numbers cooked up by Ram in order to cover up\n\nthe whole scheme. I found this argument to be extremely unmeritorious. It has to be noted\n\nthat in the trial below, P24 was admitted with the counsel’s consent after a copy of\n\nthe exhibit had been served on him. Therefore, under s 60(1) of the Evidence Act, P24 was\n\ndeemed to be admitted without the need of proof. Section 60(1) of the Evidence Act states:No fact need be proved in any proceeding which the\n\n    parties thereto or their agents agree to admit at the hearing or which before the hearing\n\n    they agree to admit by any writing under their hands, or which by any rule of pleading in\n\n    force at the time they are deemed to have admitted by their pleadings.42        Having consented to the admission of the\n\ndocument, I found that counsel was precluded from challenging the veracity of that\n\ndocument on appeal. Consequently, I found his allegation that P24 contained a list of\n\nfictitious numbers to be a display of counsel’s lack of adequate preparation of the\n\ncase prior to the appeal.",
        "Failure to call Thanabal the storeman as a witness": "43        Counsel proceeded to argue that the\n\nfailure to call on Thanabal the storeman prejudiced the case for the appellant. He sought\n\nto argue that Thanabal would have been material in demonstrating that Ram was also\n\ninvolved in the conspiracy because Ram had given Thanabal certain instructions to keep the\n\nstolen targets. It appeared to me that counsel was trying to argue that an adverse\n\ninference should have been drawn against the prosecution’s failure to call on\n\nThanabal under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act.44        It appeared to me that this was but\n\nanother one of counsel’s many valiant attempts at raising issues in the hope that he\n\nwould end up with a meritorious ground. Unfortunately, this was not one of them. I failed\n\nto see how the prosecution’s failure to call on Thanabal as a witness could have\n\npossibly prejudiced the appellant’s case. It is trite law that the prosecution is\n\nentitled to decide which witnesses it wishes to call. If the prosecution does not call on\n\na particular material witness, the prosecution bears the risk that the case against the\n\nappellant is not proven beyond reasonable doubt.45        After a perusal of the evidence and the\n\ncircumstances under which this case arose, I was of the view that Thanabal’s\n\ntestimony would have added little to the case. As I have observed above, in a charge of\n\nabetment by conspiracy, it is not necessary for the prosecution to prove that the\n\nappellant was the mastermind in the conspiracy. Consequently, so long as there was\n\nsufficient evidence (from Saravanan) to show that there had been an abetment by conspiracy\n\nbetween the appellant and Saravanan, the charge would have been proven.46        In any case, I was of the opinion that an\n\nadverse inference should not be drawn against the prosecution for the failure to call on\n\nThanabal as a witness. As the Court of Appeal held inYeo Choon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217, an adverse inference should only be drawn if it is shown that the prosecution had\n\nwithheld certain evidence which it possesses. Here, it was a simple case of Thanabal\n\nhaving left the jurisdiction prior to the investigations and therefore the police were\n\nunable to obtain statements from him. It was an issue of unavailability rather than\n\ndeliberate withholding of evidence.47        Moreover, I was also of the view that if\n\nthe appellant considered Thanabal to be a material witness, then the burden lay on him,\n\nand not the prosecution, to call him as a witness. I noted that Thanabal and the appellant\n\nwere once colleagues at Heraeus. Surely, if the appellant felt strongly about calling on\n\nThanabal, it would not have been unreasonable for him to call Thanabal as his witness.\n\nConsequently, I found that the failure of the prosecution to call on Thanabal did not\n\ncause did not materially prejudice the appellant’s case.",
        "Whether the prosecution had proven that the targets had been entrusted\n\nto Saravanan": "48        Counsel then proceeded to argue that the\n\nprosecution had failed to prove that there was entrustment of the targets to Saravanan.\n\nFor this proposition, counsel argued that Saravanan was only one of the assistant\n\ntechnicians who worked on the machine and that there were other assistant technicians who\n\ncame into contact with the targets during the course of their work. Further, he tried to\n\nshow, somewhat convolutedly, that after the targets were used in the bomb room, they were\n\nsupposed to be kept in the drawers there. Therefore, nobody was specifically entrusted\n\nwith the task of collecting the used targets from the bomb room and returning them to the\n\nstoreroom, which was where Saravanan had misappropriated the targets. Counsel further\n\ntried to rely on the following passage in Gour’sPenal Law of India(11thed), Volume IV at p 3957:Being entrusted with the doing of a job is not the same\n\n    thing as being entrusted with any property within the meaning of s 405 and other cognate\n\n    sections of the Indian Penal Code, even though some money or other property may come into\n\n    the hand of the person in the course of his doing such job.Counsel tried to show that, even though Saravanan may have been\n\nentrusted with the job, he could not be said to have been entrusted with the targets.49        I found this argument to be completely\n\nwithout merit. It was convoluted, confusing and wholly unnecessary. The short answer to\n\ncounsel’s argument was that Saravanan had already pleaded guilty to a charge under s\n\n408 of the Penal Code and had been sufficiently dealt with by the law. As the prosecution\n\nrightly pointed out, that was the best evidence to show that Saravanan had indeed been\n\nentrusted with the targets which he had misappropriated. Counsel’s allegation that\n\nother assistant technicians were also entrusted with the property, and therefore the\n\ntargets could have been misappropriated by them, was yet another baseless allegation for\n\nwhich he provided no evidence in support. Finally, the distinction between the movement of\n\nthe targets between the bomb room and the storeroom at Seagate was extremely superfluous\n\nand was not of any assistance to the appellant.50        In any case, I wish to take this\n\nopportunity to clarify counsel’s attempt at drawing a distinction between entrustment\n\nwith the doing of a job and entrustment with property. InGopalakrishnan Vanitha v PP[1999] 4 SLR 307, I recognised and upheld the distinction between entrustment with the doing of a\n\njob and entrustment with property. There, the appellant was a confidential secretary cum\n\noffice administrator who was charged with criminal breach of trust by using blank cheques\n\nsigned by her boss to make payments to overpay her own salary. I found her letter of\n\nappointment entrusted her with being responsible for petty cash and other relevant\n\npayments but I found that these did not extend to the appellant there becoming entrusted\n\nwith the funds of the company. On the facts of that case, I found that the entrustment of\n\nthe property came with her boss’s careless act of handing over signed blank cheques\n\nto the appellant and not by virtue of her job as a secretary.51        I was of the opinion that the facts ofGopalakrishnan\n\nVanitha v PPcouldbe distinguished from the facts of the present case. Here,\n\nSaravanan’s job specifically required him to be entrusted with the targets which he\n\nmisappropriated. Therefore the distinction between entrustment of a job and the\n\nentrustment of property did not have any scope for operation on the facts of this case,\n\nbecause here the entrustment of the former necessarily led to the entrustment of the\n\nlatter. Consequently, I rejected counsel’s arguments on this point.",
        "Whether the second charge had been proven beyond reasonable doubt": "52        The appellant’s defence on the second\n\ncharge was similar to his defence on the first charge, viz. that he had merely received\n\nthe two stolen ‘Tosoh’ targets from Saravanan on the instructions of Ram. For\n\nthe reasons similar to those cited above on the first charge, I did not think that there\n\nwas much merit in the appellant’s defence vis--vis the second charge. For a charge\n\nunder s 411 of the Penal Code, the prosecution has to prove that the appellant had\n\ndishonestly retained the said ‘Tosoh’ targets and that the appellant had reason\n\nto believe that they were stolen. In order to ascertain what is the meaning of\n\n‘reason to believe’, one may refer to s 26 of the Penal Code which states:A person is said to have \"reason to believe\" a\n\n    thing, if he has sufficient cause to believe that thing, but not otherwise.53        Here, there was ample evidence from\n\nSaravanan’s statements which implicated the appellant with regard to the two\n\n‘Tosoh’ targets. Moreover, the trial judge found that the appellant was not a\n\nnave person but rather a person who was experienced in this line of business. I saw no\n\nreason to disagree with the trial judge on this point. Further, like a charge under s 109\n\nread with s 408 of the Penal Code, a charge under s 411 does not require the prosecution\n\nto prove that the accused person was the mastermind behind the conspiracy. The fact that\n\nthe appellant may or may not have been the mastermind was therefore irrelevant. It is\n\ntrite law that an appellate court will not disturb the findings of a trial judge unless\n\nthe findings were against the weight of the evidence: seeLim Poh Eng v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713. On the facts, I saw no reason to disturb the findings of the trial judge in\n\nconvicting the appellant on the second charge and therefore, I dismissed his appeal\n\nagainst conviction on the second charge as well.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "54        On the appeal against sentence, counsel\n\nsubmitted that the sentence was manifestly excessive on the following grounds:(a)    The prosecution failed to prove that the value of the property\n\n    involved was US$469,800;(b)    Saravanan, as the principal offender, was merely sentenced to\n\n    four years’ imprisonment and there was no reason why the appellant should be given a\n\n    substantially heavier sentence than Saravanan; and(c)    The sentence was manifestly excessive in light of similar cases\n\n    where the accused persons were given lighter sentences even though the amounts involved\n\n    were higher.",
        "Value of the property involved": "55        First, counsel argued that the\n\nsentence should not have been as harsh because the prosecution had not managed to prove\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt that 48 targets were involved. Since I found that the charge had\n\nbeen proven beyond reasonable doubt and had dismissed the appeal against conviction, I saw\n\nno ground for entertaining this contention.Sentence meted out to accomplice56        Secondly, counsel pointed out that\n\nSaravanan, the principal offender, was only sentenced to four years’ imprisonment and\n\nthe appellant, being only a secondary offender, should not be given a substantially\n\nheavier sentence than Saravanan.57        This argument was too nave and\n\nsimplistic. Admittedly, consistency in sentencing is a desirable goal. However, the fact\n\nremains that each case must be looked at on its own special facts. The sentence meted out\n\nto an accomplice is but one of the myriad of factors that a sentencing court can take into\n\naccount for the purposes of sentencing. InPP v Ng Tai Tee Janet & Anor[2001] 1 SLR 343, I was not fettered by the sentence meted out to the accomplice when I was\n\ndeciding on the appropriate sentence for the accused persons. There, even though the\n\naccomplice was merely given a fine, I nevertheless sentenced the accused persons to a\n\ncustodial sentence. I found that to be appropriate because the accused persons played a\n\nmore active role in the syndicate than the accomplice.58        Similarly, on the facts of the present\n\ncase, I saw no reason why the trial judge’s sentencing discretion should have been\n\nfettered by the sentence meted out to Saravanan. Here, in the absence of any evidence to\n\nsupport the appellant’s allegation that Ram was indeed the mastermind, it appeared to\n\nme that it was the appellant himself who was the mastermind of the conspiracy. In that\n\nlight, the fact that a harsher sentence was meted out to the appellant was appropriate. It\n\nwas also clear from the notes of evidence that the trial judge had taken into account a\n\nwhole host of factors, including the other six charges taken into consideration against\n\nthe appellant. I found this approach of the trial judge to be correct and accordingly I\n\nsaw no reason for me to disturb the sentence on this ground.",
        "Sentence meted out in other criminal breach of trust cases": "59        Thirdly, counsel diligently brought up a\n\nnumber of cases which involved criminal breach of trust to show that lighter sentences\n\nwere imposed in those cases, even though the amounts involved were higher. While I\n\ncongratulated counsel for his diligence in bringing up those cases, the short answer to\n\nthis argument of his could be found in my judgment inSoong Hee Sin v PP[2001] 2 SLR 253. There, I observed:With respect, I\n\n    found counsel’s attempt to reduce the law of sentencing into a rigid and inflexible\n\n    mathematical formula in which all sentences are deemed capable of being tabulated with\n\n    absolute scientific precision to be highly unrealistic. If the appropriate sentence in\n\n    each case was indeed nothing more than a computation of numbers and figures, then judges\n\n    are better off delegating the task of sentencing to their secretaries and clerks who I\n\n    venture to think are possibly more adept at these things than judges. In my view, the\n\n    regime of sentencing is a matter of law which involves a hotchpotch of such varied and\n\n    manifold factors that no two cases can ever be completely identical in this regard. While\n\n    past cases are no doubt helpful and sometimes serve as critical guidelines for the\n\n    sentencing court, that is also all that they are, i.e. mere guidelines only. This is\n\n    especially so with regard to the unreported cases, in which the detailed facts and\n\n    circumstances are hardly, if ever, disclosed with sufficient clarity to enable any\n\n    intelligent comparison to be made. At the end of the day, every case which comes before\n\n    the courts must be looked at on its own facts, each particular accused in his own\n\n    circumstances, and counsel be kept constantly and keenly apprised of the fact that it is\n\n    just not possible to categorise cases based simply on mere numerals and decimal points.60        I found counsel’s attempt in drawing\n\nfrom other similar cases to be a similar attempt in reducing the law of sentencing into a\n\nrigid and inflexible mathematical formula. I take this opportunity to reiterate that in\n\nsentencing accused persons on charges of criminal breach of trust, the court’s\n\ndiscretion is never restricted by the amount involved. Each case must be looked at on its\n\nown facts. While guidelines and benchmark sentences do give some aid to ensure consistency\n\nin sentencing, the value of the property cannot, and will never, be the sole factor in\n\ndetermining the sentence. To do so would constrain the judges’ ability to give effect\n\nto the four general principles of retribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation\n\nwhen passing out a sentence: seeChua Tiong Tiong v PP[2001] 3 SLR 425,PP v\n\nTan Fook Sum[1999] 2 SLR 425 andR v Sargeant(1974) 60 Cr App R 74.",
        "Conclusion": "61        For the above reasons, I dismissed the\n\nappeal against conviction and affirmed the sentence meted out by the trial judge.",
