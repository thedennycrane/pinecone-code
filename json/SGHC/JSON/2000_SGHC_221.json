        "The pleadings": "4. As stated earlier, when the writ of summons was first filed on 23 September 1999, it\n\nwas the company which was the plaintiff. Consequently, the defendants denied owing the\n\ncompany the sum claimed (of $507,086.45) in the original defence which they filed on 8\n\nFebruary 2000. Furthermore, the original statement of claim merely stated:-1. The plaintiff's claim against the defendants is for the sum of $507,086.45 being the\n\n  balance due and owing in respect of work done and materials sold and delivered at the\n\n  defendant's request, particulars of which are known to the defendants and brief\n\n  particulars are as follows:-DateDescriptionAmount26 July 1999Statement of account$507,086.455. Not unexpectedly, counsel for the defendants by his letter dated 19 October 1999\n\nrequested for Further and Better Particulars of the all too brief statement of claim.\n\nInstead of complying with the request, counsel for the plaintiffs took the easy way out by\n\nadopting an unorthodox approach. He did not render requisite particulars of when and what\n\nsort of services the plaintiffs had provided, relating to the sum claimed. Instead, he\n\nfiled as annexure 'A' a list which he had directly lifted from the company's ledger of\n\ntrade debtors, pertaining to the claim amounts. The statements comprised the plaintiffs'\n\ninvoices, their quotations and the defendants' purchase orders.6. The so-called Particulars filed on 23 November 1999 did not satisfy the defendants\n\nand their counsel applied to court (the first application) and obtained on 8 December 1999\n\nan order for the same set of Further and Better Particulars he had earlier requested. The\n\nplaintiffs did not comply with the order within the deadline stipulated. Consequently, the\n\ndefendants applied on 14 January 2000 (the second application) for an 'unless order' that\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim be dismissed with costs unless they furnished the set of Further and\n\nBetter Particulars the defendants had previously requested. Before the second application\n\ncould be heard however, the plaintiffs, in purported compliance with the order made under\n\nthe first application, filed their second set of Further and Better Particulars on 21\n\nJanuary 2000; it was only a slight improvement on their first set. The second application\n\nheard on 3 March 2000 was resisted by the plaintiffs whose counsel contended they had\n\nrendered adequate Particulars. In lieu of ordering the plaintiffs to file a third set of\n\nFurther and Better Particulars, the court granted the defendants leave to file a Rejoinder\n\npursuant to the plaintiffs' Reply.7. On 7 April 2000, the defendants obtained a third order of court for the company (as\n\nthe then plaintiffs) to furnish security for the defendants' costs in the amount of\n\n$100,000 by way of a banker's guarantee. In the affidavit which she filed to support this\n\napplication, Jacqueline deposed that at all times the defendants dealt with the two\n\nbrothers/present plaintiffs and her company had nothing to do withB & K Interior\n\nDcor Pte Ltdwhich she pointed out was a $2 paid up company only incorporated on 19\n\nMarch 1999.8. On the first day of trial (5 May 2000) counsel for the plaintiffs finally seemed to\n\nrealise his mistake and applied to court to amend the writ of summons and all subsequent\n\npleadings to reflect the correct position that the two brothers, not the company, are the\n\nplaintiffs. I granted the application despite objections from counsel for the defendants\n\nand made the usual consequential orders for amendments to the defendants' own pleadings\n\nand costs. Counsel for the plaintiffs also applied to amend his clients' claim on the\n\nRenault project (31 Scotts Road) from $37,293.50 to $12,293.50 and that for Dragages from\n\n$32,994 to $32,651, thereby reducing the plaintiffs' original claim of $507,086.45 to\n\n$481,743,45. Contrary to the final submission made by counsel for the defendants, that sum\n\ndoes exceed the current jurisdiction ($250,000) of the district courts.9. As a consequence of the change in name of the plaintiffs in the pleadings, the\n\ndefendants filed an amended Defence and Counterclaim on 8 May 2000 in which they raised\n\n(for the first time) a counterclaim ($119,884.10) for over-payments they made to the\n\nplaintiffs on the AXA Insurance and Euro RSCG projects. In her written testimony,\n\nJacqueline reduced the counterclaim by $26,154.50 to $93,729.60. With regards to some of\n\nthe other projects, the defendants admitted there were balance sums owed to the plaintiffs\n\nbut raised the defence of set-off alleging that the plaintiffs' works were unsatisfactory\n\nand or defective; rectification works were therefore required which rectification works\n\nwere not carried out by the plaintiffs or if carried out, were not done properly. For\n\nother projects like AGF, 31 Scotts Road, Renault Motor Show and Hillcrest Arcadia, the\n\ndefendants contended they had paid the plaintiffs' claims in full and nothing more was due\n\nfrom them. The defendants put the plaintiffs to strict proof of their claims for Publicis\n\nEureka, L'oreal and Dragages.10. In the course of the trial, it emerged that the defendants saw most of the\n\nquotations (upon which the plaintiffs based a substantial part of their claim), only on or\n\nabout 16 April 2000 when the documents were made available for inspection at the office of\n\nthe plaintiffs' solicitors. The defendants contended they had neither received nor seen\n\nthose quotations previously whereas the plaintiffs claimed that the same had been\n\nforwarded/handed to the defendants or their representatives earlier.The evidence11. Because of the number of projects involved and the number of witnesses (5 for the\n\nplaintiffs and 11 for the defendants), trial took 17 days even though (as I informed the\n\nparties at the commencement) I would only determine liability and leave the quantum of\n\ndamages if any, pertaining to both the claim and counterclaim to be assessed by the\n\nRegistrar at a later stage. Equally, it would be impossible to conduct a detailed\n\nexamination of all the testimony adduced from the 16 witnesses. For expediency therefore,\n\nI propose to deal with both the claim and counterclaim and make my findings on a project\n\nby project basis. I should also point out that the plaintiffs did not carry out the\n\nprojects in succession but very often, a number of projects overlapped which factor I\n\nbelieve did affect their performance.(i) Renault(a) 31 & 33 Scotts Road12. In their documentation, the defendants described 31 Scotts Road as the main house\n\nand 33 Scotts Road as the back-house/outhouse. According to the first plaintiff, the\n\nouthouse is 2-3 times smaller than the main house. The defendants had admitted they\n\nwithheld $12,292.50 (after paying the plaintiffs $162,582.47) on both houses for purposes\n\nof their set-off and counterclaim, due to the following defects in the plaintiffs' work\n\nwhich they claimed were not rectified:(i) the external walls were not water-jet washed and plastered before painting,\n\n  resulting in paints peeling within a month after hand-over to Renault;(ii) some pieces of wood on the wooden deck at the rear yard broke within a month of\n\n  hand-over because of the poor quality wood used by the plaintiffs;(iii) the cabling works short-circuited within a few weeks which caused illumination\n\n  spotlights not to work and had to be replaced.As a result of the plaintiffs' bad workmanship, the defendants asserted they had no\n\nalternative but to give a discount to Renault in the amount of $4,590.71 (see DB170).13. The plaintiffs called their painter Teo Boon Liew (who claimed to have 40 years'\n\nexperience) to rebut the defendants' allegation that they failed to do a proper job of the\n\nwater-jet cleaning and painting works. Teo Boon Liew (PW5) testified that (accompanied by\n\nthe plaintiffs' father) he had rented a water-jet machine and obtained his supply of paint\n\nfrom a shop at Balestier Road in September 1998. He had used the water-jet machine to\n\nspray the walls before applying sealant and two (2) coats of paint. It took him about two\n\n(2) weeks to water-jet wash, plaster and paint the walls. Teo said he received no\n\ncomplaints after he finished nor was he asked by the plaintiffs to do any rectification\n\nworks. If indeed the paint peeled, Teo speculated that it could be due to either the wall\n\n(very old) or the weather; he disagreed it could be due to his workmanship. Questioned by\n\nthe court, Teo revealed he did not pay for the paint; presumably Ng did. That being the\n\ncase, Teo was in no position to say whether the paints selected by Ng were weather-proof\n\nand or meant for outdoor/exterior use.14. The defendants on the other hand called their own supervisor/handyman Lim Kim Leng\n\n(LKL) to testify to the contrary. LKL (DW5) testified that he and his assistant Tan Eng\n\nHuat were instructed by the defendants in late January 1999 to attend to Renault's\n\ncomplaints which included the cracked/discoloured paint on the external walls and the\n\nbroken wooden deck. While he only had to replace 2-3 pieces (costing around $50) of the\n\ndeck, Lim Kim Leng said his assistant had to repaint the walls entirely using\n\nweather-proof paint after first using a water-jet to wash off the discoloured paint. In\n\nher written testimony, Jacqueline said the defendants engaged another contractor Relion\n\nPlasterceil Electrical & Dcor to supply and install new cables. She also produced\n\nher company's credit note evidencing the discount of $4,590.71 given to Renault.15. As I am only concerned with liability for all the projects, I need only determine\n\nwhether the defendants have made out their case on their counterclaim on a balance of\n\nprobabilities, so as to defeat the plaintiffs' admitted claim for $12,293.50; I do not\n\nconcern myself with the quantum of the defendants' counterclaim as that is a matter for\n\nassessment if necessary. I find on the evidence that the defendants have succeeded on\n\ntheir counterclaim. As neither counsel questioned the plaintiffs' painter on the point,\n\nthere is no evidence on the weather conditions prevailing at the time Teo Boon Liew\n\ntestified he plastered and then applied sealant and two(2) coats of paint to, the walls.\n\nConsequently, I am unable to say whether wet weather could have had an adverse impact when\n\nthe plaintiffs' painter did the work. Speaking from my knowledge acquired from previous\n\nsimilar cases and given that Teo Boon Liew himself testified he took about 2 weeks to\n\ncomplete the entire job, I can only speculate that the walls were not given sufficient\n\ntime to dry both before and after, the application of the first coat of paint; this would\n\nthen cause the first and subsequent coat(s) of paint to peel and discolour.16. Apart from denying their workmanship was poor/defective, the plaintiffs did not\n\ncall evidence from their workers or subcontractors (who carried out the actual work) to\n\nrebut LKL's testimony or the defendants' photographs (see DSB38-41) evidencing the broken\n\nwooden deck. Instead, they obtained a letter dated 8 May 2000 (exhibit P10) from Renault\n\nsigned by Pascale Mao, the assistant to their vice-president, stating thatthe\n\nrenovations which have been carried out at no. 31 and 33 Scotts Road have been done in a\n\nvery professional and satisfactory manner and that there are no defects whatsoever.\n\nExhibit P10 has no evidential value whatsoever as Pascale Mao (so stated in the letter)\n\nhas no personal knowledge of the renovations having joined Renault in July 1999,well\n\nafterthe plaintiffs completed their work and far more important,afterthe\n\ndefendants had rectified the plaintiffs' defective works.17. Even if I am wrong in my findings, I am of the view that the plaintiffs are\n\nprecluded from making any claims in relation to 33 and 31 Scotts Road because their father\n\nNg had signed a final account with the defendants on 7 December 1998 (at DB157 and 159)\n\nwhich stated:There will be no further claim (sic) acceptable after the signing of this document for\n\n  the above project completed at 31 Scotts Road on the 7thNovember 1998.A similar final account (see AB276A) was signed by the plaintiffs with the defendants\n\nalso on 7thDecember for the motor show which project I next turn my attention\n\nto.",
        "(b) the motor show": "18. According to Ng, Lamine had agreed (N/E 307) with him to pay the plaintiffs $3,900\n\nto 'compensate' the plaintiffs for the loss they suffered on the Renault motor show. Ng\n\nclaimed that in his presence, Lamine had instructed the defendants' accountant Chua Kok\n\nChuan (David Chua) to issue a purchase order to the plaintiffs for $3,900 and he (Ng) had\n\nsigned the final account on that understanding.19. The defendants on the other hand contended that there was nothing owing as the\n\nplaintiffs' father had signed the final account with Lamine on 7 December 1998 together\n\nwith that for 31 Scotts Road containing the sentence set out in para 17 above.\n\nAccordingly, the defendants argued, if the plaintiffs were to be paid an extra $3,900, Ng\n\nshould not have signed the final account but having done so, the plaintiffs were precluded\n\nfrom making that or any other, claim(s). David Chua (N/E 631) testified that Ng approached\n\nhim a few daysaftersigning the final accounts and claimed that Lamine had agreed\n\nto compensate the plaintiffs $3,900. As he was not authorised to approve costing of\n\nprojects, David Chua (DW9) told Ng to seek Jean-Marc's or Lamine's approval but Ng did not\n\nrevert thereafter. Ng and Lamine signed the final accounts for the motor show and 31 and\n\n33 Scotts Road simultaneously in David Chua's presence without discussing any\n\ncompensation.20. The plaintiffs' statements of account showed that their last invoice for 31 Scotts\n\nRoad (AB64) was dated 4 December 1998 whilst that for 33 Scotts Road was dated 30 October\n\n1998. Initially, when he was questioned on these invoices (N/E 314) Ng had agreed he could\n\nnot claim. However, after the lunch break on 16 May 2000, Ng changed his mind and said he\n\nwas not prepared to withdraw the plaintiffs' claim (which had been reduced to $12,293.50\n\non the first day of trial). Lamine's testimony was not particularly helpful on 31 and 33\n\nScotts Road either; he merely confirmed that he had agreed to compensate the plaintiffs\n\n$3,900 for the motor show, that the total contract price for 31 Scotts Road was\n\n$174,875.97 (N/E 395) but no final account was necessary for 33 Scotts Road.21. On the evidence, I am satisfied that final accounts were signed between the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendants for all three jobs undertaken for Renault. In his\n\ncross-examination of David Chua, counsel for the plaintiffs had suggested that for smaller\n\nprojects such as 33 Scotts Road and Hillcrest Arcadia, work would be carried out by the\n\nplaintiffs based on purchase orders and no final accounts would be rendered. David Chua\n\nagreed but denied that was the case for Renault's projects. He pointed out that the\n\n(signed) final account (DB160) for 33 Scotts Road (with a figure of $105,926.50) added to\n\n$68,949.47 for 31 Scotts Road (at DB158) totalled $174,875.97 which was the contract sum\n\nas confirmed by Lamine.22. I accept the defendants' contention – I see no reason why the plaintiffs\n\nshould be allowed to renege from their agreement (that they would have no more claims) as\n\nencapsulated in the final accounts for 31 and 33 Scotts Road and for the motor show.\n\nAccordingly the plaintiffs' claims for the three Renault projects fail. As stated earlier,\n\nthe defendants succeed on liability in their counterclaim against the plaintiffs. Their\n\ndamages would include the credit note of $4,590.71 given to Renault for 31 & 33 Scotts\n\nRoad and $9,509.35 (DB357) for the motor-show if found to have been reasonably incurred in\n\norder to pacify Renault for the plaintiffs' shoddy workmanship. Incidentally, the credit\n\nnote for $4,590.71 was prepared by David Chua (N/E 654) on Lamine's instructions with the\n\nconsent of the defendants' directors. It was Jacqueline's testimony (N/E704) which I\n\naccept, that Renault would not pay the defendants otherwise. It was also her testimony\n\n(N/E 697) which the plaintiffs did not or could not challenge, that the plaintiffs did not\n\nmake a claim for the Renault project for 1  years. Why the delay one would ask, if\n\nindeed the plaintiffs' claim was genuine?No. 26 Plymouth Avenue23. Besides the main claims (3) pertaining to Renault, the plaintiffs also had a small\n\nclaim ($2,600) under invoice no. 2157 touching on work done at the residence (No. 26\n\nPlymouth Avenue) of the Renault's manager-director Saint Martin. Lamine testified that\n\n(N/E 395) he made a commercial decision to do the work gratis on the defendants' behalf in\n\nthe hope that it would lead to new projects from Renault. However, he also said it did not\n\nmean that the plaintiffs were precluded from charging the defendants. My view is that if\n\nthe defendants cannot claim from Renault, then neither can the plaintiffs. This is\n\nespecially so when the other works done for Renault by the plaintiffs were less than\n\nsatisfactory and the defendants are unlikely therefore to reap the benefit of Lamine's\n\npersonal generosity.",
        "(ii)Hugo Boss": "24. The second plaintiff was in charge of the Hugo Boss project. He complained that the\n\ndefendants did not pay a cent even though they admitted owing the plaintiffs $45,520. He\n\nacknowledged the ten (10) display counters built by the plaintiffs had minor defects but\n\nthose defects only needed to be rectified … (i) the glass panels needed adjusting;\n\n(ii) the stainless wires which held the shelves in place needed to be tightened; (iii) the\n\nHugo Boss logo sticker had to be adjusted and (iv) the cabinet doors needed to be aligned.\n\nThe defects did not warrant the total replacement of all the counters by Kemvet Interiors\n\nPte Ltd (Kemvet) at the purported cost of $25,750. The second plaintiff blamed poor design\n\nor other factors as the reason for the plaintiffs' defective works. He cited as examples\n\nthe cracking of the semi-circular plastic panel from the heat generated by the down-light;\n\nhe had forewarned the defendants' designer Delphine Leoni (Delphine) of this possibility.\n\nHowever, questioned by counsel for the defendants, the second plaintiff would not commit\n\nhimself on whether the drawings for Hugo Boss counters (from its parent company Procter\n\n& Gamble's designer) called for curved instead of the flat square panels which the\n\nplaintiffs actually fabricated nor whether 'brand' counters would be expected to come\n\nsupplied with logo stickers (for which the plaintiffs claimed $500); he merely said he\n\nfollowed the designs and instructions of Delphine. The second plaintiff explained that\n\nbecause the counters were installed at various departmental stores where Hugo Boss had\n\noutlets, installation of the counters could only take place at night after 10pm when the\n\nstores had closed. For that reason, the plaintiffs billed the defendants the cost ($500)\n\nof dismantling and removing the existing counters which charges the plaintiffs asserted\n\nwere not included in the contract price for the job.25. The defendants disagreed with the second plaintiff's testimony that the counters\n\nhad only minor defects. They blamed the plaintiffs' poor workmanship as the cause for\n\nrejection by the local agent Prestige Products Distribution (Prestige), of all the Hugo\n\nBoss counters; this adversely affected the defendants' goodwill with Prestige with\n\nconsequential loss of further business to the defendants. To substantiate their\n\ncontention, the defendants produced correspondence they had exchanged with Prestige which\n\nthey reinforced with Delphine's testimony.26. According to Delphine (DW8), the plaintiffs told her the oval-shaped glass for the\n\ncounters was difficult to obtain in Singapore. They therefore sourced for the glass in\n\nKuala Lumpur but, when the same arrived, it could not fit the counters which doors were\n\nalso not aligned. The plaintiffs then suggested acrylic as a replacement. In order to use\n\nacrylic, the design had to be changed, using a lot of wood whereas the original design\n\nincorporated a lot of glass. Because of time constraints, Prestige had no choice but to\n\naccept the alternative proposed. However, after a month, the acrylic cracked due to\n\nbending and the counters were again rejected by Prestige. Delphine said the plaintiffs\n\nattempted to solve that and other problems with the counters for over four (4) months\n\nwithout success. She denied the second plaintiff's claim that the original designs were\n\nfor flat squarish panels … from the start, the panels were oval shaped according to\n\nProcter & Gamble's designs. The defendants engaged Kemvet to modify the plaintiffs'\n\ncounters but were told it was not practical. Kemvet used the same designs/drawings\n\noriginally given to the plaintiffs to fabricate the new counters.27. The defendants called Kemvet's managing-director Wong Chin Seng (WCS) to\n\ncorroborate Delphine's testimony. WCS (DW3) testified that Delphine and Jean Marc\n\napproached him in May 1999 to rectify the existing back panels, back walls and crack-lines\n\nin the plaintiffs' counters. He inspected the counters in the presence of representatives\n\nof Prestige who highlighted the defects to him and as well as the rectification works\n\nrequired. Although rectification was possible, WCS was of the view that rectification\n\nwould cost more than making new counters because the plaintiffs had not fabricated\n\naccording to specifications. Hence his company made new counters for which curved glass\n\nhad to be fabricated. Although they were completed in August 1999, Kemvet did not complete\n\ninstallation of the last lot of new counters until February 2000 after installing two lots\n\nat shopping centres in August and October 1999. Because he had a back-to-back agreement\n\nwith the defendants as regards payment, WCS said he did not expect to be paid (the balance\n\nless deposit) for the 10 counters until the defendants were first paid by Prestige. WCS\n\nsaid the defendants issued a purchase order for the counters without which (save where\n\nwork was required to be done urgently) it was his company's practice not to commence work.28. Having reviewed the evidence, I have no doubt that the plaintiffs did not do a\n\nproper job in fabricating the counters thereby necessitating their total replacement by\n\nKemvet. I am equally certain that the reason was because (as admitted by the second\n\nplaintiff) the plaintiffs lacked experience in manufacturing such counters. That fact\n\nhowever does not exonerate them. As Jacqueline said (N/E 728), if the plaintiffs could not\n\ndo the work, they should not have accepted the order. The plaintiffs also claimed $500 for\n\nshelving works carried out at an office at TradeMart building for either Prestige or\n\nCosmopolitan, they were not very certain who the owner was. What was certain though is,\n\nthat the defendants did not request for such works nor were they aware it was done at the\n\nmaterial time. Lamine had testified that (N/E 395) the work was carried out at the\n\nclient's request for their accountant who needed a pigeon-hole below the side-return of\n\nher desk. I cannot see how the defendants can be liable for these works which were not\n\neven in the plaintiffs' pleadings. The plaintiffs should look to either Cosmopolitan for\n\npayment or failing that, claim from Lamine personally.29. The defendants had issued two (2) purchase orders for Hugo Boss totalling $45,520\n\nover and above which the plaintiffs claimed $3,000 by way of three (3) quotations. I have\n\ntouched on their quotations(2) on transport and dismantling charges. Giving the plaintiffs\n\nthe benefit of the doubt that the defendants' purchase orders did not include the 2 items,\n\ntheir claim of $1,000 for both is allowed. That leaves the plaintiffs' remaining quotation\n\nfor $2,000 pertaining to 4 curved poster panels with wooden frame and acrylic. In the\n\nlight of the evidence adduced, this claim is disallowed. Against the increased contract\n\nprice of $46,520 ($45,520 +$1,000) the defendants are entitled to set-off the costs they\n\nincurred in engaging Kemvet to dismantle and replace the plaintiffs' counters which were\n\nrejected by Prestige. Counsel for the plaintiffs had sought to suggest that as his\n\nclients' counters were used for 14 months (from October 1998 to February 2000) before the\n\ndefendants replaced them, the same was necessitated by wear and tear and not due to the\n\nplaintiffs' faulty workmanship; I disagree. It is common ground that the plaintiffs'\n\ncounters were placed in departmental stores/shopping centres and the\n\ndefendants/Prestige/Kemvet could not replace them without approval from the\n\nbuildings’ owners. It should also be noted that Kemvet was first instructed in May\n\n1999 to try to make improvements on the plaintiffs' counters and failing that, to\n\nfabricate new ones. It is noted however that Jacqueline has withdrawn the defendants'\n\nclaim (N/E 723) for $17,250 for a sum due and outstanding from Hugo Boss which was paid by\n\nthe time she testified.",
        "(iii)AXA Insurance": "30. The plaintiffs were requested to renovate AXA's regional office at Battery Road for\n\na total sum of $213,556.24 based on 12 purchase orders of the defendants variously dated\n\nbetween 17 August 1998 and 20 January 1999. The defendants asserted they paid $242,545 on\n\nthe contract thereby overpaying the plaintiffs by $28,988.76 which refund they\n\ncounter-claimed. The plaintiffs did not deny the defendants' payments but contended that\n\ntheir claim totalled $284,975.02 because of a lot of additional work done; hence the\n\ndefendants still owed them $42,430.02.31. According to the second plaintiff (who personally supervised the project assisted\n\nby his father), the defendants themselves had prepared final accounts for this project\n\nbased on the plaintiffs' claim of $284,173.84 (see AB207). Although he acknowledged the\n\nalleged final accounts were not signed by either party, the second plaintiff claimed that\n\nwas because after David Chua gave him the final accounts, he called the latter to say that\n\nthe plaintiffs agreed to the same but he was not asked to return to the defendants' office\n\nto sign in exchange for the defendants' cheque. The second plaintiff testified that the\n\nplaintiffs issued 11 quotations for variations and or additions because the works were\n\noutside the scope of the original contract. Jacqueline not Lamine, was in charge of this\n\nproject and she would know of the additions and variations claimed.32. David Chua testified (N/E 630) that he prepared the alleged final accounts on the\n\ndefendants' behalf based on the plaintiffs' figure of $284,173.84 as a draft for\n\ndiscussion purposes; that was why he deleted the date 6/1/99. He wrote the words'to\n\nissue purchase orders'13 times against the plaintiffs' various quotations to remind\n\nJean Marc (who was then not in Singapore) of the plaintiffs' request that purchase orders\n\nbe issued for those. He had received the plaintiffs' quotations from the first plaintiff\n\nall at one time when the latter came to his office. He had also told the first plaintiff\n\n(who denied it) that the final accounts were subject to approval. In any case, he was not\n\nauthorised to sign final accounts on the defendants' behalf (this was confirmed by\n\nJacqueline); the authorised persons were Jacqueline and Jean Marc and in their absence,\n\nLamine.33. Jacqueline confirmed that the plaintiffs were overpaid for this project; she listed\n\nout the 6 cheques whereby the defendants paid the plaintiffs a total of $242,545. However\n\nin the course of trial, the defendants admitted liability (but not quantum) for electrical\n\nand cabling works set out in the plaintiffs' quotation no. BK 8983 (see AB 174).\n\nJacqueline explained it was because she checked and realised that no provision was made\n\nfor such work in the defendants' bill of quantities. The defendants also admitted another\n\nitem (supply of a magazine rack at $650) claimed by the plaintiffs. Even so, the\n\ndefendants had still overpaid the plaintiffs although the figure would be reduced.34. Although the plaintiffs' stand was that the defendants' draft final accounts\n\naccepted their claim of $284,173.84, they had also withdrawn certain items claimed in the\n\ncourse of trial. By way of illustration, the first plaintiff withdrew (N/E 142) the\n\nplaintiffs' claim for the supply of labour ($480) admitting that it should be included in\n\nthe Preliminaries item in the bill of quantities. The plaintiffs also withdrew their\n\nclaims for pantry tiles ($1,350) and gypsum board partitions at the PD room ($1,020). In\n\nso doing, the plaintiffs made a tacit admission that the figure of $284,173.84 was not\n\nfinal but, as the defendants argued, subject to negotiations.35. I do not accept that the plaintiffs are entitled to any more monies apart from what\n\nthe defendants have admitted; I also accept that the defendants have overpaid the\n\nplaintiffs and are entitled to a refund of the overpaid sum on their (reduced)\n\ncounterclaim not to mention that the plaintiffs' workmanship was not up to mark. It was\n\nthe evidence of the defendants' supervisor LKL (N/E 557) that the plaintiffs' shoddy\n\nworkmanship included a failure to install rear-panels for some file cabinets. However,\n\nwhen he informed Delphine (DW8) who informed Jacqueline in turn, LKL was chided by Lamine\n\nwho said LKL should have informed Lamine first before anyone else. Cross-examined on this\n\nevidence, LKL added that he did not ask the plaintiffs' representatives about the missing\n\npanels because past experience told him the latter would take no action and they would\n\nonly convey what he said to Lamine. Much was made by the first plaintiff (N/E 147-148/167)\n\nof what he claimed was a design fault for a door (and some drawer cabinets) which\n\nnecessitated Jacqueline and Jean Marc visiting the plaintiffs' Johor factory which problem\n\nhe gave himself credit for solving. Delphine however testified (N/E 592-593) on the\n\nshortcomings in the plaintiffs' carpentry works and their inability to follow her designs\n\nproperly especially for the full height main door, necessitating a revision in her\n\ndrawings. She pointed out that other contractors did not encounter any difficulty in\n\nfollowing the same drawings for the door.",
        "(iv)Vivendi": "36. According to the plaintiffs, their father was in charge of this project assisted by\n\nthe first plaintiff. In his written and oral testimony, Ng said he agreed with Lamine to\n\ndo the project for $200,000 a reduction from his original asking price of $250,000; this\n\nwas reflected in the defendants' purchase order no. 1534 (see AB 265) dated 23 September\n\n1998 with completion scheduled for 20 October 1998. The price was low because Lamine said\n\nthat Vivendi had a tight budget. For that reason, the defendants paid the plaintiffs\n\nup-front a deposit of $50,000 on 24 September 1998. The plaintiffs claimed for additions\n\nand or variation works which they asserted were either ordered by the defendants or by\n\nVivendi; they denied the defendants' contention that they undertook the project on a\n\nturn-key basis.37. Ng testified at length on the plaintiffs' additional claims. He produced drawings\n\n(see 2AB1-95) to support his contention that there were numerous design changesafterhe was given the first drawing dated 22 September 1998 (2AB5) upon which he agreed to do\n\nthe project for $200,000. Ng claimed that after the plaintiffs had done the work according\n\nto the original drawing, the defendants made amendments which changes affected partitions\n\nand work stations which had been erected and, electrical cables. The plaintiffs also\n\nsupplied new furniture as Vivendi decided not to use its existing (system) furniture.\n\nThese major changes added $101,441.61 to the contract price after taking into account the\n\ndefendants' payments totalling $220,522.84. The plaintiffs also worked under time\n\nconstraints as the project was completed by 20 October 1998.38. The commencement date was however disputed by the defendants who produced Vivendi's\n\nendorsement signalling approval of the defendants' drawings to prove that work could only\n\nhave commenced on or after 7 October 1998. The defendants also produced a memorandum\n\n(exhibit D1) from Vivendi dated 11 October 1998 stating that only certain works needed to\n\nbe completed by 28 October 1998 for the visit to Singapore by the president of Vivendi.\n\nLamine however said (N/E 458) that by end October the plaintiffs had completed 70% of the\n\npartition works.39. Contrary to the defendants' stand, Ng said the plaintiffs' scope of works excluded\n\nsubmission fees by the appointed architects (DP Architects) and M & E engineers\n\n(Meinhardt Pte Ltd). He said this was made clear by the defendants' bill of quantities\n\ndated 23 September 1998 (see 2AB7-8) which contained the following note (the Note):-This quotation does not include:1. Submission fee to DP Architects and Meinhardt Pte Ltd2. M & E Woks are subjects for actual site measurement.In any case Ng argued, the architects and engineers were not appointed by the\n\nplaintiffs but by the owners of Centennial Tower, so why should the plaintiffs be\n\nresponsible for their fees?40. In the above regard, Lamine had testified (N/E 454) which evidence was echoed by\n\nthe first plaintiff (N/E 232), that he and the first plaintiff signed the bill of\n\nquantities because thepayment was way below the normal cost and [he] wanted a strong\n\ncommitment on the price;other contractors would have charged easily $300,000. Yet\n\nLamine also said (N/E 437) that the project was not a lump sum contract. The plaintiffs\n\nproduced their copy of the bill of quantities (exhibit P8) which contained the Note\n\nwhereas it was missing from the defendants' copy (exhibit D2).41. On the signatures in the bill of quantities, Jean Marc testified (N/E 779) that as\n\nhe was/is in charge of purchase orders, why should anyone else sign for the defendants? He\n\nadded that when he handed the bill of quantities to Ng, it did not contain either Lamine's\n\nor the first plaintiff’s signatures nor the Note. He pointed out that in lump sum\n\ncontracts, quantities are never specified. Conversely, if quantities are specified, it\n\nwould not be a lump sum contract.42. The defendants' interior designer Anthony Acaban (who is also in charge of costing\n\ntogether with Jean Marc) testified (N/E 576) that when he prepared the bill of quantities\n\nit did not include the Note; he first discovered there were signatures (which he did not\n\nrecognise) on the Vivendi bill of quantities when P8 was shown to him by the defendants'\n\nsolicitors in May 2000. Acaban (DW7) said that P8 should not be with the plaintiffs as the\n\ndefendants normally fax or gave a photocopy of, but not the original, bill of quantities\n\nto their contractors. When he checked his own computer copy of the bill of quantities,\n\nAcaban found there was no annotation thereon other than for GST (goods and services tax).\n\nAcaban explained that the software (Microsoft's EXCEL) used to print bill of quantities\n\nwas commonly used in the defendants' office and his files were accessible to everyone\n\n(including Lamine) as they were not locked but kept on a window-ledge; no one needed his\n\npermission to look at the files. When counsel for the plaintiffs (N/E 625) showed the\n\noriginals (exhibits P11-12) of other bills of quantities (L'oreal, Rogers & Wells,\n\nAXA) as well as Vivendi’s to him, Acaban said he did not know how the same came to be\n\nin the plaintiffs' possession as he had not handed them the originals; on Jacqueline's\n\ninstructions, original bills of quantities were kept in the defendants' files. Acaban\n\nnoted that the second original (P11) of the Vivendi bill of quantities produced by the\n\nplaintiffs had 12 October 1998 as the date whereas the first (P8) bore the date 23\n\nSeptember 1998.43. Jacqueline deposed that because the plaintiffs failed to do the requisite\n\nsubmissions, the defendants engaged DP Architects Pte Ltd and professional engineers\n\nMeinhardt to submit all the necessary plans, blueprints and drawings to the relevant\n\nauthorities and to oversee the project at a cost of $4,680 and $12,793.84 respectively\n\n(see DB337). She further alleged that the plaintiffs failed to provide certain\n\n(decorative) light fittings and the plaintiffs had to obtain them from Million Lighting\n\nPte Ltd at a cost of $1,450. She also complained about the plaintiffs' workmanship and the\n\npoor quality of their materials resulting in pieces of furniture being rejected by\n\nVivendi, relying on correspondence in the defendants' bundle of documents between the\n\nplaintiffs, defendants and Vivendi in support thereof. These defects caused the defendants\n\nto be out-of-pocket (by $23,071) in having to engage other contractors to carry out\n\nrectification works. Jacqueline pointed out that if rectification works resulted from the\n\nplaintiffs' mistakes, the defendants would not issue a purchase order to acknowledge\n\nliability. Her allegations were denied by Ng who said the plaintiffs' only responsibility\n\nwas to provide ordinary not decorative lights and, the plaintiffs' workmanship was\n\nacceptable, given the time constraints.44. A perusal of the drawings (see 2AB1-95) for the Vivendi project revealed that the\n\ndrawings had dates which varied from 9 September 1998 to 5 January 1999. Against Ng's\n\nclaim that the plaintiffs started work on 22 September 1998, the defendants produced a\n\nletter dated 18 August 1998 (see DSB50) from Centennial Tower's owners (Marina Properties\n\nPte Ltd) to Vivendi giving notice that the fitting-out period would be one (1) month from\n\n1 October 1998. This was reinforced by a letter to Vivendi from Millenia Singapore (see\n\n2AB96) which stated that the fitting out works would commence on 1 October 1998 and be\n\ncompleted by 10 November 1998.45. I had also noted that the two (2) copies of the bills of quantities exhibited in\n\ncourt namely the plaintiffs' (P8) and the defendants' copy (D2) did not have unit costs;\n\nhowever the plaintiffs' second copy (P11) had the unit charge as well as the total cost. I\n\nfind it strange that the plaintiffs should have what appears to be two (2) originals of\n\nthe same bill of quantities and yet the two copies are not mirror images of each other\n\n… they bore different dates and different contents. In the light of the testimony of\n\nAcaban and Jean Marc which I believe, I am certain that it was not the defendants but\n\nLamine, who handed P8 or P11 to the plaintiffs. The following observations are also\n\npertinent:-i. the plaintiffs' bundle of documents filed on 2 May 2000 did not include P8 or P11\n\n  although they included the defendants' purchase order no 1534 dated 23 September 1998 for\n\n  $200,000; the purchase order statedPlease see details enclosedbut the\n\n  details presumably the bill of quantities, was missing from their bundle;ii it was only in their second bundle of documents filed on 15 May 1998 that the\n\n  plaintiffs included the bill of quantities which original was P8; this wasafterNg\n\n  had started his testimony. The plaintiffs produced P11 on 25 May 1998afterAcaban\n\n  was recalled to the witness stand;iii. neither P8 nor P11 appeared in the plaintiffs' list of documents.The question which arises is, why did the plaintiffs not produce their copies of the\n\nbill of quantities earlier? I surmise the plaintiffs deliberately withheld disclosing the\n\ndocument earlier because the original format (D2) was unfavourable to their claim. It is\n\nalso my belief that P8 and P11 came into their possession through Lamine who printed out\n\nthe same using EXCEL software after altering the contents to suit the plaintiffs' claim.\n\nSimilarly it was Lamine who procured for the plaintiffs the other original bills of\n\nquantities shown to Acaban. Lamine gave the plaintiffs two versions of the bill of\n\nquantities which differed from D2 to help them overcome the problem that they had agreed\n\n(through their father) to do the project for a lump sum of $200,000. I note that neither\n\nNg nor Lamine proffered any explanation why they would have two originals of the same bill\n\nof quantities but with different contents.46. It is equally noteworthy that although Lamine supported Ng's evidence that\n\nsubmission to the relevant authorities was outside the plaintiffs' scope of work, he\n\nhimself had written to Meinhardt on 8, 12 and 13 October (see DSB57-59) requesting for M\n\n& E drawings. Earlier on, by a letter dated 17 September 1998 (DSB55) to Vivendi\n\n(copied to the defendants and attentioned to Lamine) from Marina Properties Pte Ltd,\n\nVivendi wasrequired to engage the landlord's consultants for the necessary submission\n\nto relevantauthorities for the above by 21 September 1998. It therefore does\n\nnot lie in the mouth of Lamine to assert otherwise. He well knew that the entire project\n\nwas to be undertaken by the plaintiffs on the defendants' behalf; if submission was part\n\nof the defendants' obligation, there was no reason for the defendants not to pass the\n\nresponsibility onto the plaintiffs. Sometimes, I could not understand Lamine's evidence. I\n\ncite as an example, his testimony that carpets were part of the plaintiffs' scope of works\n\n(N/E 460); yet, in the next breath, Lamine said the work was not done by the plaintiffslike\n\nmost of the projects.47. In the light of my findings, I am of the view that the plaintiffs' claim for\n\nVivendi is highly suspect. They could not have commenced work by 23 September 1998 as Ng\n\nclaimed let alone completed the project by 20 October 1998 (although that may have been\n\nthe target date) when Vivendi was only allowed to commence work on 1 October 1998. Their\n\nevidence that they had to re-do approximately 85% of the work done by 9 October 1998\n\nbecause of design changes was also refuted by Delphine (N/E 594) who said that was not\n\npossible when the plaintiffs had only started work on 1 October 1998. Further, the\n\nplaintiffs' quotations were largely duplications of works requested in the defendants' 13\n\npurchase orders. Those purchase orders added up to $34,629.50 for extra works not included\n\nin the bill of quantities dated 23 September 1998. Therefore it was incorrect for the\n\nplaintiffs to claim the contract was only for a lowly $200,000 … the actual figure\n\nwas $234,629.50. There were also numerous complaints from Vivendi on the plaintiffs'\n\nworkmanship; these went unheeded or were not satisfactorily attended to. The plaintiffs\n\nwere responsible for but failed to make, submissions through DP Architects and Meinhardt\n\nPte Ltd for what was actually a turn-key project.48. Accordingly, the plaintiffs are liable on the counterclaim for the expenses the\n\ndefendants incurred in engaging the aforementioned architects and engineers to do the\n\nnecessary submissions and for failing to supply some of the lights provided in the bill of\n\nquantities. The bill of quantities in D2 governs this contract, not P8 or P11 which\n\ndocuments I reject for the reasons set out earlier. Against the total contract value of\n\n$234,629.50 the defendants have paid $220,522.84. They are entitled to retain the\n\ndifference ($14,106.66) pending the determination of their counterclaim. It was also\n\nJacqueline's evidence (N/E 757) which I have no reason to doubt, that the defendants'\n\nfinal measurements showed omissions of $23,000 from the plaintiffs' scope of works. These\n\nincluded the plaintiffs' failure to supply and install carpets for which the defendants\n\nengaged Palova Marketing & Services (Palova) to do so at a cost of $1,045, according\n\nto the testimony of Palova's director Koh Swee Lian. Accordingly, the defendants are\n\nentitled, after assessment by the Registrar, to payment from the plaintiffs for such\n\nomissions.",
        "(v)L'oreal": "49. I move next to the L'oreal fitting-out contract at Winsland House; this was the\n\nlast project the plaintiffs completed for the defendants before their relationship soured;\n\nit was also the largest in terms of value, being $597,309.12 if one relies on the\n\ndefendants' bill of quantities dated 17 December 1998. The defendants admitted owing the\n\nplaintiffs a balance of $67,150.12 which payment they said they withheld because of the\n\nplaintiffs' inferior workmanship and materials. It necessitated the defendants having to\n\nengage three (3) other contractors to rectify or do works omitted by the plaintiffs which\n\ncost ($2,817.80) they sought to set-off against the balance sum owed to the plaintiffs.\n\nOne of the contractors engaged by the defendants was Parisan Interior Dcor whose\n\nsole-proprietor Lim Kim Mook (DW2) testified he visited the site with David Chua in March\n\nand July 1999 after which he carried out remedial works on the instructions of L'oreal's\n\nrepresentative. He charged and was paid, $4,473 for his work. Another contractor called to\n\ntestify by the defendants was Palova whose director Koh Swee Lian (DW4) said her company\n\nwas instructed by the defendants to supply and install carpets and wallpaper in December\n\n1998, in the total sum of $42,940.20.50. The plaintiffs on the other hand originally claimed $611,045.63 for this contract.\n\nThey then deducted $41,501.73 for carpets, chairs and wallpaper which they admitted were\n\nnot supplied thereby reducing their claim to $569,543.90 of which a balance of $63,500 was\n\nstill owing by the defendants. The first plaintiff who was in charge of the project,\n\ndenied the defendants' allegations of poor workmanship and materials. He also denied that\n\nthe plaintiffs failed to carry out rectification works which in any case were minor\n\ndefects which only required touch-ups. The rush job had to be completed in just 5 weeks\n\nand, in order to meet the deadline, the plaintiffs had at least 200 workers on site day\n\nand night for 2 weeks. The designers ERA Construction (ERA) were surprised but pleased so\n\nmuch so that the plaintiffs were given more work by L'oreal which they were still doing as\n\nat the date of trial.51. The first plaintiff claimed there were no complaints from ERA after the plaintiffs\n\nhanded over the project in January 1999. He said the plaintiffs had based their scope of\n\nworks on the defendants' bill of quantities dated 11 December 1998 (AB163) in the sum of\n\n$585,017.23 notwithstanding that the plaintiffs received the later bill of quantities\n\ndated 17 December 1998. He denied that the parties were still in negotiations on the bill\n\nof quantities as at 17 December 1998 insisting that the price of $611,045.63 had been\n\norally agreed. In any case the defendants gave the plaintiffs 4-5 bills of quantities for\n\nthis project.52. The first plaintiff acknowledged that sometimes the plaintiffs sent more than one\n\nquotation for the same item (tempered glass door being an example). However, this was to\n\nallow the defendants to select and the plaintiffs would only charge the defendants for,\n\none quotation. Contrary to the defendants' assertion that they only paid against purchase\n\norders they issued to the plaintiffs, the first plaintiff highlighted various quotations\n\nthe plaintiffs had issued to and which were paid by, the defendants without purchase\n\norders being issued by the latter. Re-examined by his counsel, the first plaintiff added\n\nthat the plaintiffs had in fact under-claimed as they had omitted to include certain\n\nquotations and variations orders for this project.53. The defendants on the other hand relied on the later bill of quantities dated 17\n\nDecember 1998 (see DB429-433) which terms (item 1) clearly stated it superseded a previous\n\nquotation dated 24 November 1998 while item 24 stated:This quotation are[sic] subject\n\nfor actual site measurement. Consequently, the defendants argued, whatever the bill of\n\nquantities issued to the plaintiffs, the final amount payable to the plaintiffs was\n\nsubject to measurements.54. As for the bill of quantities (dated 11 December 1998) upon which the plaintiffs\n\nrelied, Acaban explained that it was subject to additions and deletions of items of work\n\nas requested by L'oreal; that was one of five (5) bills (he prepared) which were given to\n\nthe plaintiffs in on-going negotiations on the scope of work and pricing. He confirmed\n\nthat he did take into account where warranted, the plaintiffs' variation claims, by\n\nissuing purchase orders on the defendants' behalf. According to counsel for the\n\ndefendants, the plaintiffs duplicated in some of their variations orders, work for which\n\npurchase orders had been issued by the defendants.55. In her testimony, Jacqueline said she was in charge of the site as L'oreal did not\n\nwant Lamine's presence. Hence, she knew exactly what work the plaintiffs did or omitted to\n\ndo. She explained that (N/E 696) she did not accept the late suggestion of\n\nplaintiffs’ counsel to appoint a quantity surveyor to assess the work done by the\n\nplaintiffs because the defendants had done substantial rectification works and what can be\n\nseen at site would not reflect the plaintiffs' work/workmanship. Although the defendants\n\nhad been paid on its last invoice (N/E 769), Jacqueline said there was no and could be no,\n\nfinal account with L'oreal upon which the defendants could claim because her company was\n\nstill attending to defects. Even so, she was convinced she did not owe the plaintiffs\n\nanything.56. At a late stage, the plaintiffs produced a copy of the defendants' tax invoice no.\n\n048-99 in the sum of $698,850.13 addressed to Cosmetique De France (the\n\nagents/distributors of L'oreal) to support their claim. They argued that if the defendants\n\nthemselves claimed variations orders from L'oreal and were paid, the defendants could not\n\ndeny the six (6) variation claims of the plaintiffs. For that reason, counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs attempted (during the trial) to have the defendants produce (inter alia), their\n\ninvoices, variation orders, quotations, receipts etc rendered for 13 projects including\n\nVivendi. The notice to produce was objected to by counsel for the defendants which\n\nobjection I upheld not only because it was madeafterthe 10thday of\n\ntrial but, also because it would not achieve the plaintiffs' intended purpose.57. In the above regard, I noted that throughout the trial the plaintiffs (as well as\n\ntheir counsel), repeatedly maintained that the defendants were/are main contractors who\n\nsub-contracted entire projects to the plaintiffs; the defendants then marked-up the\n\nplaintiffs' prices when they invoiced their own clients in order to make a profit. That is\n\ntoo simplistic a view and with respect, it is also erroneous. Jacqueline, when questioned\n\nby counsel for the plaintiffs as to Lamine's and her role on site, said (N/E 675) he/she\n\nrepresented the client, not the defendants; this is correct. The defendants' role,\n\ncontrary to the plaintiffs' perception was not really that of a main contractor. It was\n\nmore akin to that of a clerk-of-works entrusted with the task of supervising projects for\n\ntheir employer. Hence, the defendants charged their clients a profit and attendance fee.\n\nThey assumed a supervisory role because the defendants' clients did not wish to do so or,\n\nto engage a clerk of works and, they were happy to pay the defendants to take over the\n\nresponsibility. That being the case, the plaintiffs' argument that they were entitled to\n\nbe paid in turn if the defendants had been paid by their own clients is misconceived.58. In the course of cross-examination, counsel for the defendants had suggested (N/E\n\n239) to the first plaintiff that just before the L'oreal project was awarded to the\n\nplaintiffs, the plaintiffs and their father had already planned to set up a company with\n\nLamine on the latter's representations that he would be able to secure French clients for\n\nthe new company and thereby by-pass the defendants. However, because Lamine was not able\n\nto deliver what he had promised (save for small jobs from Renault and L'oreal) the\n\nplaintiffs and Lamine then decided to make this claim against the defendants. That was the\n\nreason why the defendants were not even aware of some quotations as the work done therein\n\nwas meant to be gratis. Counsel highlighted the fact that although L'oreal project was\n\ntwice that in value of Publicis Eureka, yet the plaintiffs only issued 6 variation orders\n\nas against 18 for the latter. He suggested to the first plaintiff that the reason was\n\nbecause the plaintiffs realised that they could no longer inflate or make double claims\n\nbecause Lamine was no longer in charge of the defendants' projects. This allegation was\n\nvehemently denied by the first plaintiff. I shall make my observations on Lamine's\n\ntestimony at a later stage.59. I find it strange that the defendants would issue subsequent bills of quantities if\n\nindeed only that dated 11 December 1998 was meant to govern the L'oreal project. The\n\ndefendants must have issued the (undisputed) 4-5 bills of quantities for purposes of\n\nnegotiations as Acaban testified. That being the case, the plaintiffs cannot conveniently\n\nrely on an earlier bill of quantities and not those that came later which one can safely\n\nassume would revise or supersede the former. I suspect they did so in order to avoid item\n\n24 (supra para 53) of the terms stated in the defendants' bill of quantities dated 17\n\nDecember 1998 … that it was a measurement contract. That being the case, the\n\nplaintiffs' work is subject to measurements and until measured, their claim for this\n\nproject is premature.",
        "(vi)Publicis Eureka (Publicis)": "60. This project at King's Centre was under the charge of the first plaintiff and was\n\ncompleted in December 1998. On the defendants' part, Lamine was removed from charge, in\n\naccordance with the wishes of Publicis, although this was denied by Lamine who claimed he\n\nwas still on very good terms with the company. The plaintiffs claimed $299,772.10 on which\n\na balance of $59,772.10 was still outstanding, the defendants having paid $240,000.61. The defendants on the other hand contended that the contract value was $281,820.50\n\nbased on their bill of quantities dated 20 November 1998 (see DB375). They alleged that\n\nthe plaintiffs failed to complete the work specified in the said bill of quantities\n\nnecessitating the defendants having to engage third parties to do so. In her written\n\ntestimony (para 81), Jacqueline listed 11 omissions and 9 items of the plaintiffs' work\n\nwhich required rectification. The defendants produced photographs (see DSB2-36) to\n\nsubstantiate their allegations and also letters from Publicis dated between 22 December\n\n1998 and 15 November 1999 containing complaints on the defects; it included a letter dated\n\n11 May 1999 to Jacqueline from Ivan Chong the CEO of Publicis which contained the\n\nfollowing paragraph:We are disappointed that the workmanship is not up to standard. All the locks and\n\n  doorknobs gave way within weeks and as you mentioned, the office is just 4 months old! The\n\n  Boardroom table was badly done despite the touching up work. The joints have cracked.Jacqueline and David Chua said they also had to suffer the indignity of being shouted\n\nat by Ivan Chong (N/E 635, 680) in the presence of the staff of Publicis because of the\n\nplaintiffs' bad workmanship. The defendants (via Jacqueline) had to give a letter of\n\nwarranty to Publicis (see DB400-401) dated 3 June 1999 covering manufacturing defects by\n\nreason of design, materials and workmanship; otherwise the defendants would not be paid\n\nthe balance sum owed by Publicis. The defendants contended they were entitled to deduct\n\nfrom the balance owed to the plaintiffs the costs of work and rectification totalling\n\n$41,820.50. In fact, according to Jacqueline (N/E 771) the defendants were still attending\n\nto defects in Publicis which they were not claiming from the plaintiffs.62. To substantiate the defendants' allegation of defects, Lim Kim Mook of Parisan\n\nInterior Dcor testified that he accompanied David Chua for a site inspection in April\n\n1999 after which, on the instructions of someone from Publicis, he carried out\n\nrectification works for which he billed the defendants and was paid, $6,895. The\n\ndefendants' supervisor LKL (DW5) also testified that for flooring works, the plaintiffs\n\nprovided ordinary paint instead of epoxy floor finish as stipulated in the bill of\n\nquantities; according to Jacqueline (N/E 775) epoxy floor finish was more than a paint --\n\nit provided protection, had 5-10 years guarantee and could withstand heavy traffic. It was\n\ntherefore better suited for workshops and factories.63. The first plaintiff did not deny that the plaintiffs failed to carry out certain\n\nworks. He had deducted the cost ($16,344.40) of three (3) items which the plaintiffs did\n\nnot do namely: (i) painting ($6,000), (ii) chairs ($2,920) and carpets ($7,424.40) from\n\nthe contract sum of $281,820.50 thereby reducing it to $265,476.10. However, he claimed a\n\nfurther $34,296 for additional works and variations carried out by the plaintiffs; hence\n\nthe contract amount increased to $299,772.10. He denied there were defects but said\n\ntouch-ups were required (N/E 129). The first plaintiff spent considerable time in the\n\nwitness box detailing the work which comprised the plaintiffs' additional claims. When\n\nshown an invoice (DB379-380) of Kemvet dated 10 February 2000 engaged by the defendants to\n\nattend to four (4) defects, the first plaintiff denied it was to rectify the plaintiffs'\n\nwork. Kemvet's managing director WCS (DW3) however testified he carried out the work on an\n\nurgent basis for the defendants; his testimony was not challenged by the plaintiffs.64. In an attempt to reduce the areas of dispute (touching on additional as well as\n\nrectification works) between the parties, I had instructed the parties to visit the\n\npremises of Publicis in the midst of trial. According to the plaintiffs, the defendants\n\nrefused entry to Lamine but the defendants countered that access was denied by Publicis,\n\nwho considered Laminepersona non grataapparently because he had a skirmish with\n\nthe company's top management (N/E 260) at the beginning of the project. The outcome of the\n\nsite visit on 13 May 2000 (see N/E 258-260) was, that some measurements were taken but not\n\ncompleted; the defendants but not the plaintiffs, were willing to continue the inspection\n\nexercise on Sunday 14 May 2000. Measurements for partitions, cornices and skirting were\n\nagreed to by the plaintiffs. Part of the difficulty was due to the fact that alterations\n\nwere made after the plaintiffs completed the project and the defendants were unable to\n\nverify whether certain items were variation orders. Hence, nothing conclusive or useful\n\ncame out of the site inspection.65. There were some items in the Publicis project for which the defendants are clearly\n\nnot liable. The first was an item of work directly requested by Publicis -- to supply\n\npower to two separate divisions. In their quotation BK1350 (see SAB29) the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves stated:Please be informed that according to owner [sic] instruction…We\n\nhave quoted owner $1,000 for the above separation. The plaintiffs should look to\n\nPublicis for this claim. In addition, the plaintiffs are not entitled to their claims for\n\nmounting of the logo and television set, as set out in their quotation BK 9243. According\n\nto Delphine (N/E 594/613), the plaintiffs mounted the television set on the wall instead\n\nof on the ceiling as it was intended, because the ceiling board they provided at the\n\nreception area could not take the weight. The gypsum board they installed could not\n\nsupport the logo and had to be reinforced. Had the plaintiffs visited the old office of\n\nPublicis as they should have, they would have known beforehand of the size and weight of\n\nboth items and the positioning requirements. Why then should the defendants have to pay\n\nfor works which they either did not order or were necessitated by the plaintiffs' own\n\nfault? Neither can the plaintiffs claim for the work done in BK 9264 to provide a\n\nwood-cap/cover for the projector screen. It was Jacqueline's testimony that when Ivan\n\nChong shouted at her in the presence of the first plaintiff for the poor (but expensive)\n\nworkmanship of the plaintiffs and Ivan Chong inquired whether it was too much to ask for\n\nthe screen to have a cover, the first plaintiff indicated he would provide the same but\n\ndid not mention he would charge for it.66. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then the photographs taken by the\n\ndefendants spoke volumes of the plaintiffs' workmanship as they showed:-(i) inferior materials being used (empty plywood) for cabinets rendering the table-tops\n\n  being too weak to take the weight of such equipment as monitors;(ii) ordinary paint instead of epoxy finish being used for flooring;(iii) skirting which was cracked or badly joined or fell off or not done at all\n\n  exposing wiring which should have been concealed;(iv) poor tiling works;(v) cracks on joints between partitions;(vi) uneven plastering;(vii) cracking of laminate;(viii) cracks in ceiling boards.(ix) door handles which dropped off and faulty keys which could not lock.Delphine had also testified on the plaintiffs' poor workmanship (N/E 612). She said the\n\nplaintiffs could not as they were supposed to, dismantle the boardroom table from\n\nPublicis' previous office, for reasons unknown to her. Hence, the plaintiffs manufactured\n\na new boardroom table which cracked as did the table they made for Ivan Chong.67. The plaintiffs had agreed to the defendants' measurements (see AB341 and N/E 282)\n\nafter the joint site visit on 13 May 2000 but not to the defendants' deduction of\n\n1,581.12m for omissions from the bill of quantities. The first plaintiff explained that\n\nwas because what he saw at site was not what was handed over by the plaintiffs in 1998\n\n– items such as partitions had been removed as could be seen from the photographs in\n\nexhibit P2 which he took.68. In the light of the bad workmanship shown in the defendants' photographs in\n\nDSB2-36, the plaintiffs cannot succeed on their reduced claim for $55,788.10 ($59,772.10\n\nless the sums of $1,545, $1,380 and $1,059 conceded by the first plaintiff); their work\n\nwas not of an acceptable standard. I do not see why the defendants should be liable for\n\ndefective works which they or Publicis subsequently removed; such removal would not have\n\nbeen necessary had the plaintiffs done the work properly in the first place. Accordingly,\n\nthe defendants are entitled to a set-off for the omitted works totalling 1,581.12m when\n\nassessed as well as for the costs of rectification.",
        "(vii)Lancome": "69. The defendants admitted owing the plaintiffs a balance of $400 on this project (for\n\ncounters) but not the sum claimed of $5,240 based on three (3) variation quotations issued\n\nby the plaintiffs in October 1998. The defendants pleaded that payment was withheld\n\npending final accounting and rectification of defective works. Jacqueline deposed that the\n\ndefendants neither received nor accepted the October quotations. On the other hand, the\n\nsecond plaintiff who was in charge of this project, blamed the defendants' designer (who\n\nhe did not name); he alleged she was not sure about the design and had reduced the height\n\nby 200 mm after the plaintiffs had completed the work with consequential alterations\n\nhaving to be made to doors and other structures involving additional costs. Questioned on\n\nwhether the plaintiffs followed the defendants' drawing/layout, the second plaintiff could\n\nonly remember there were some alterations but not whether they were due to changes in\n\ndrawings (N/E 41). Although he had testified (N/E 14) it was his practice to write the\n\nworddoneon the plaintiffs' quotations to indicate work which had been carried out\n\nand he had so written on BK 9129 (see AB25) for the supply of stools, under\n\ncross-examination (N/E 46/97), the second plaintiff conceded that it was the defendants\n\nwho purchased the counter stools.70. Delphine had testified (N/E 592/602) that the plaintiffs' fabrication of the\n\ncounters was 350 mm short of the required 3.5m and some work was not done while the finish\n\nwas poor. She further testified that she had purchased the mirrors which formed part of\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim in BK 9084 on which again the second plaintiff had written the worddone.\n\nThe poor quality of the plaintiffs' work was reflected in Lamine's faxes (2) to them dated\n\n22 October 1998. The new counters were the subject of one of the plaintiffs' additional\n\nclaims. Another problem was the promo-tank showcase meant for promotion of Lancome's\n\nproducts. The acrylic piece provided by the plaintiffs for the counter top did not fit\n\nproperly with the result that Lancome rejected the same and ordered a replacement from\n\nFrance. Because of the defects, all the counters at Metro store (at The Paragon) had to be\n\nreplaced. The defendants produced faxes from Delphine and Lamine to the plaintiffs\n\n(DB109-112) in this regard.71. It would seem that, like the Hugo Boss project, the Lancome project was further\n\nproof of the plaintiffs' inexperience with counters. The second plaintiff was evasive when\n\ncross-examined on this project. I do not see why the defendants have to pay the plaintiffs\n\ntwice, once for counters which were not properly fabricated and the second time for\n\nreplacement of the rejected counters, nor for the alteration of the promo-tank when all\n\nthe additional works resulted from the plaintiffs' bad workmanship and inability to follow\n\nthe defendants' drawings. It was also undisputed that the plaintiffs did not supply the\n\ncounter stools. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' claim for $5,240 is rejected while the sum\n\n($400) admitted by the defendants to be still owing to them with be withheld pending\n\nassessment of the defendants' counterclaim.",
        "(viii)The French Embassy": "72. The plaintiffs claimed the sum of $14,321.50 over and above the sum of $6,631 the\n\ndefendants agreed to pay under two (2) purchase orders. The work was carried out at two\n\n(2) apartments occupied by staff of the French Embassy at Block 253 #03-10 and at Block\n\n255C #14-23 respectively, at Hillcrest Arcadia. The defendants refused to accept the\n\nplaintiffs' quotations for $14,321.50 on the basis that the works stated therein were not\n\nrequested by them.73. The first plaintiff was in charge of Hillcrest Arcadia. He testified that the works\n\nwere carried out at the request of embassy staff and on the instructions of Lamine. These\n\nincluded changing a door lock, clearing waste water pipe blockage, supplying and\n\ninstalling ceiling fans, aluminium sliding doors, mosquito netting, hot water heater,\n\ndrawer cabinet etc. However, he withdrew claims in items 1 and 4 of the plaintiffs'\n\nquotation BK 9020 totalling $650.74. At my suggestion, representatives of the defendants visited the 2 apartments after\n\nwhich their counsel informed the court (N/E 137) that the defendants would not contest\n\nclaims for items which the plaintiffs installed provided that the latter were able to\n\nproduce invoices or receipts evidencing such purchases. The defendants also conceded\n\nliability on the plaintiffs' quotation BK 9048/A (see AB 296-7) for $1,750 save for one\n\nitem (no. 3 for $100) and agreed to pay the sum of $240 claimed in BK 9013. The burden is\n\nnow on the plaintiffs to substantiate the sum claimed therein as well as furnish proof of\n\npurchase of the ceiling fans quoted in BK 9028. Consequently, the plaintiffs succeed in\n\nthis claim on liability only and the quantum of their claim has to be agreed with the\n\ndefendants or failing that, to be assessed.",
        "(ix)AGF Insurance": "75. The defendants asserted they had paid the plaintiffs in full the contract sum\n\ntotalling $6,400 encapsulated in three (3) purchase orders. The plaintiffs claimed a\n\nfurther sum of $650 in their quotation BK 9017 (AB 270) dated 1 September 1998 for\n\ndismantling and disposing of partitions. This claim was subsequently withdrawn during the\n\ntrial.",
        "(x)Other projects": "a. Parsing (FE) Pte Ltd76. The defendants did not deny owing the plaintiffs a balance of $8,986 on the\n\ncontract sum of $10,286. They asserted (through Jacqueline) that they withheld the balance\n\nas retention monies pending the finalisation of accounts and as a set-off against the cost\n\nof rectifying the plaintiffs' defective works. In the light of my earlier findings, the\n\ndefendants were justified in withholding payment of the balance sum.",
        "b. Perising Pte Ltd": "77. Similarly, the defendants did not dispute liability for the small sum of $480\n\nclaimed by the plaintiffs but again raised the defence of set-off for the cost of\n\nremedying defects in the plaintiffs' work. Again I am of the view that they were entitled\n\nto do so.",
        "c. Rochas": "78. The defendants requested the plaintiffs to make and supply display racks, cabinets\n\netc at Metro outlets (Woodlands and The Paragon) and at Seiyu. They did not pay the\n\nplaintiffs the contract sum of $20,270 at all, again for the reasons stated in para 76. I\n\nhold they were justified in not paying.",
        "d. Cosmopolitan - Gucci": "79. The defendants similarly did not pay the admitted contract sum of $12,000 for the\n\nsame reasons given above, for which I believe they were justified.",
        "e. Dragages Singapore Pte Ltd": "(Dragages)80. The defendants admitted to a contract sum of $24,657 by their bill of quantities\n\ndated 8 February 1999 on which they had paid $20,000 by a personal cheque from Jacqueline.\n\nThey further maintained that the bill of quantities was a final account between the\n\nparties. The second plaintiff (who was in charge of this project) denied this however and\n\nclaimed another $32,651 on top of the contract sum (reduced from $32,994 by their counsel\n\non the first day of trial). The figure of $32,651 is also incorrect and should be $32,551.\n\nIn fact, the plaintiffs initially contended that the contract price was $25,000 until the\n\ndefendants produced the bill of quantities. The second plaintiff said the further sum\n\npertained to variations and additions for the renovation works carried out on two (2)\n\nfloors of Jit Poh Building between August and October 1998. Although he initially denied\n\nreceiving the bill of quantities in February 1999 (see N/E 64 which document was not in\n\nthe plaintiffs' bundle of documents), the second plaintiff subsequently testified (N/E 68)\n\nthat the bill of quantities was the main contract given to him before work commenced.\n\nCross-examined, in particular on whether he had double-invoiced the defendants for items\n\nalready included in the bill of quantities, the second plaintiff's stock answers were\n\neither'can't remember'or'not sure'or'I have to check' which\n\nsupposed checks came to nought. His cross-examination (see N/E 67-70) revealed that the\n\nplaintiffs were clearly attempting (in their quotations) to recover the costs of\n\nrectifying defects in their works or the cost of dismantling works which had been\n\npreviously rejected by the defendants.81. I totally reject the plaintiffs' claim on the Dragages project. It was clear from\n\nthe highly unsatisfactory answers given by the second plaintiff under cross-examination\n\ncoupled with examples of double claims which counsel for the defendants had highlighted to\n\nhim, that the claim for $32,994 was completely unmeritorious. What is even more obvious\n\nwas that the bill of quantities was dated four (4) monthsafterthe plaintiffs had\n\ncompleted the project. Its purpose could only have been that it was meant to be a final\n\naccount between the parties, not for the plaintiffs to commence work and that final\n\naccount took into consideration all variation works. Yet, the plaintiffs deliberately\n\nfailed to disclose the document (which had been faxed to them) or even to refer to it\n\neither in their (limited) pleadings or in the second plaintiff's written testimony\n\nbecause, it was to their disadvantage to do so. I should add that at one stage, I\n\nreprimanded the second plaintiff and reminded him that he was giving evidence under oath\n\nwith the consequences of perjury as, he was testifying with a complete disregard for the\n\ntruth. The defendants will have to pay the plaintiffs the balance of $4,657 subject to the\n\nright of set-off for sums found on assessment to be due to the defendants on their\n\ncounterclaim.",
        "f. Cosmopolitan - Seiyu (Bugis Junction)": "82. The contract sum for this project was $40,116 on which the defendants paid $31,576.\n\nThey asserted payment of the balance ($8,540) was withheld because of defects in the\n\nplaintiffs' works. The second plaintiff who was in charge of this project, claimed he\n\nnegotiated and agreed with Lamine, on additional sums totalling $4,355 reflected in the\n\nplaintiffs' seven (7) quotations variously dated between 14 August and 9 November 1998.\n\nCross-examined, the second plaintiff could only assert that the work described in the\n\nquotations was done at Lamine's request; he denied they related to abortive or remedial\n\nworks or works which were already included in the defendants' purchase orders (10) issued\n\nfor this project.83. What is remarkable about this claim is, that the plaintiffs' quotations of which BK\n\n8900 (AB35) is an example, contained these words:Terms of payment: 40% downpayment under confirmation30% progressive payment30% upon completion of jobAt other times, as can be seen from BK 8930 (AB36), the plaintiffs' quotations\n\ncontained these words:Agreed & Confirmed by……………………………APRIM (FAR EAST) PTE LTDWhy then would the plaintiffs do the work which they claimed they did when they were\n\nneither paid a deposit nor was the quotation confirmed, by the defendants? I entertain\n\nconsiderable doubts on the authenticity of this claim and I believe, for reasons which I\n\nwill elaborate on later, that these quotations were fabricated by the plaintiffs –\n\nthe alleged works reflected therein were not done.",
        "g. French Business Centre (No 89 Neil Road)": "84. The defendants admitted owing the plaintiffs the contract sum of $1,180 which again\n\nthey refused to pay pending final accounting and rectification works; I agree they were\n\njustified in so doing.",
        "h. Eurasia Fragrance": "85. There was a small claim for $180 by the plaintiffs for installation of a cabinet\n\nlock. The defendants denied liability on the ground they did not request for the lock.\n\nCross-examined (N/E 72), the second plaintiff said other than his own testimony, he had no\n\nevidence such as an invoice to prove this claim. Accordingly, this claim is rejected.",
        "i. EURO RSCG": "86. On this project it was the defendants who claimed a sum of $99,729.60 from the\n\nplaintiffs alleging that the latter have been overpaid by that amount as the plaintiffs\n\nhad omitted certain works and or provided less quantities (after measurements) than that\n\nset out in the contract. The second plaintiff did not deny that the plaintiffs owed the\n\ndefendants some monies on this contract but claimed he did not know the exact amount. The\n\nfirst plaintiff claimed (N/E 136) he was confused because when the defendants paid the\n\nplaintiffs $100,000 by payment voucher no. 5680 on 4 December 1998 (DB531B), there was no\n\nmention in the payment voucher that part of the payment $59,043.40) was meant for EURO\n\nRSCG. The second plaintiff complained that the defendants would pay the plaintiffs and\n\nthen change their minds later on what the payments were for.87. David Chua however, testified (N/E 629) that after the plaintiffs were paid\n\n$100,000 by payment voucher no. 5680, he had sent them a fax on 17 December 1998 (DB531A)\n\ngiving a breakdown for the amount including $59,043.40 for EURO RSCG. Contrary to the\n\nplaintiffs' allegations, David Chua said it was only occasionally that he changed the\n\npayment details by faxing to the plaintiffs a few days after they had been paid. I accept\n\nthat the plaintiffs were overpaid by $99,729.60 by the defendants and accordingly the\n\ndefendants succeed on their counterclaim for this amount.",
        "The testimony of the witnesses": "88. I turn now to make some observations on the key witnesses for this case. The second\n\nplaintiff (PW1) had testified (N/E 14/20) that it was his practice to write the worddonewhenever he completes a job. His brother (the first plaintiff) on the other hand (see\n\nN/E 160) said sometimes he ticked but at other times he did not, items when the works were\n\ndone but, when not done, he would write the wordsnot done. At another stage of his\n\ncross-examination, the first plaintiff (N/E 189) changed his testimony to say when he\n\nwrote the wordsjob done, he meant it was an additional job required. I am unable\n\nto accept his testimony at face value. As an example, I refer to the plaintiffs' quotation\n\nBK 9129 at AB25 which has already been discredited. Although the worddonewas\n\nwritten thereon by the first plaintiff, he had admitted under cross-examination, that the\n\nplaintiffs did not supply the counter stools to Lancome. There is no assurance that he did\n\nnot make the same mistake with regards to other quotations where he wrote the worddone.89. Counsel for the defendants had also suggested (N/E 180) to the first plaintiff that\n\nhis family had planned (in December 1998) to set up another company to compete with the\n\ndefendants. It was then that the plaintiffs started to issue the quotations which were the\n\nsubject of their claim and which had been previously rejected by Lamine. Although the\n\nfirst plaintiff denied counsel's suggestion, he nevertheless could not satisfactorily\n\nexplain why he, his father or brother, never thought of approaching the defendants'\n\ndirectors to inquire why the latter did not pay the outstanding amounts under the numerous\n\nquotations, particularly when the second plaintiff admitted he was at the defendants'\n\noffice practically every day (N/E 37). The first plaintiff could only say lamely that his\n\nfather had requested payment; the requests were all verbal save for one letter to the\n\ndefendants in February-March 1999.90. In the course of cross-examination, counsel for the defendants had inquired of\n\nLamine (N/E 481) why all the plaintiffs' invoices (which formed the basis of their claim)\n\nwere variously dated between August and December 1998, after Lamine had broken up with\n\nJacqueline. The defendants contended that Lamine initiated this claim to exact his revenge\n\non Jacqueline whose relationship with him terminated after Jean Marc (and his sister) came\n\nfrom France to join the defendants around September 1997. Lamine naturally denied (N/E\n\n392) this allegation, he claimed he was not involved in let alone that he had\n\nmasterminded, this suit. He said he only knew he would be called as a witness by the\n\nplaintiffs very late in the day.91. At this juncture, I need to digress to consider the testimony of an independent\n\nwitness called by the defendants to corroborate their claim that Lamine indeed had an axe\n\nto grind against them. The witness was Frans Karel Bogaert (Bogaert) a senior\n\nvice-president of a multinational company and a personal friend of Jacqueline. I should\n\nalso point out that counsel for the plaintiffs objected strenuously to paras 5 and 6 of\n\nBogaert's written testimony, complaining that the paragraphs were scandalous and frivolous\n\n(N/E 385). Bogaert had alleged that when he met up with Lamine for lunch on 3 January 1999\n\nafter the latter's return from Australia, Lamine seemed extremely agitated and drove his\n\ncar in a dangerous fashion. Lamine had also told Bogaert that Jacqueline had refused to\n\nlend him $50,000 even though the amount wassmall moneyto her and Lamine had added\n\n'I swear to you that she will pay me one way or another'and, when Bogaert\n\nattempted to cool him down and asked what he planned to do, Lamine had replied 'You'll\n\nsee'. I overruled counsel's objections as the paragraphs were clearly relevant on the\n\nissue of Lamine's motives and whether he was the instigator of this suit as the defendants\n\nalleged.92. Contrary to the protestations of plaintiffs’ counsel, when he took the stand,\n\nLamine did not deny he had said the wordssmall moneyto Bogaert. He testified (N/E\n\n391-2) that even if he had made the threats alleged, Bogaert should have understood that\n\nthe words were said out of stress and anger but he did not mean them – he was\n\ndisturbed having broken up a relationship with Jacqueline after three (3) years, he had no\n\njob and no accommodation. He did ask Jacqueline for $50,000 but she had not responded to\n\nhim as was expected of a girlfriend and of someone whom he had helped for three (3) years\n\nto develop her business.93. When he took the stand however, Bogaert disagreed with Lamine. He said he was\n\nshocked (N/E 566) by what Lamine said and did not view Lamine's words as an idle threat.\n\nIt was not the fact that Lamine wanted a loan at short notice which Bogaert found\n\nobjectionable but, the way Lamine intended to procure the money. Neither did Lamine\n\nexplain or justify his demand. Bogaert's experience with Lamine (when the defendants\n\nrenovated the office of his previous company) told him that Lamine could be quite short\n\ntempered; Bogaert felt that this case would not have come to court if not for Lamine's\n\nrevenge.94. Throughout his testimony, Lamine consistently maintained that he always acted in\n\nthe defendants' best interests inter alia, in negotiating prices with contractors\n\nespecially with the plaintiffs whose prices (he claimed) were among the cheapest in the\n\nmarket. He described the plaintiffs in glowing terms as honest, hardworking, very\n\ncommitted, very reactive, able to negotiate pricing with him, flexible in their prices and\n\nbasically nice people to deal with (N/E 390). Further, they were like a second family to\n\nhim as he had no one in Singapore; they even visited him when he was warded in hospital.\n\nLamine was particularly grateful that after he left the defendants' employment with no\n\njob, prospects or home and he approached the plaintiffs' father for work, he was taken on.\n\nRegrettably, I do not share Lamine’s opinion of the plaintiffs or their father.95. Having seen the demeanour of all the key witnesses who each spent a considerable\n\namount of time in the witness box, I am inclined not to accept or believe, the testimony\n\npresented by the plaintiffs, their father and Lamine. Indeed, where Lamine was concerned,\n\nthe more he said he acted in the defendants' best interests, the less I believed him. He\n\nwas not a truthful witness and neither were the plaintiffs nor their father. Lamine was\n\nthe proverbial nigger in the woodpile; in the words of David Chua, he is not very\n\nscrupulous (N/E 633). I have no doubt that Lamine did instigate the plaintiffs to initiate\n\nthis suit which they would not have done otherwise. I do not believe, from my observance\n\nof them in court, that the plaintiffs are capable of prosecuting this claim on their own\n\nand by that, I do not mean their lack of formal education. Not only did Lamine make use of\n\nthe plaintiffs (who were willing accomplices) to carry out his personal vendetta against\n\nthe defendants/Jacqueline, he had also (as counsel for the defendants suggested) attempted\n\nto take away the defendants' business by incorporating LG Interior Fitting & Contract\n\nPte Ltd on 22 September 1999 with the first plaintiff (while he was still in the\n\ndefendants' employment) to offer the same services as the defendants. In this regard, it\n\nwas foolish of the second plaintiff to say and to expect the court to believe (when asked\n\nby counsel for the defendants), that the lettersLGstood for Lucky Go (N/E 74)\n\nwhen it was so very obvious that they referred to Lamine's initials.96. Just as the defendants sought to persuade the court that Lamine was not a credible\n\nwitness, the plaintiffs similarly attempted to discredit Jacqueline. In his final\n\nsubmissions, counsel for the plaintiffs contended that Jacqueline's testimony that she did\n\nnot see (most of) the plaintiffs' quotations before April this year cannot be true. He\n\nargued that she lied by referring to selective portions of her testimony to highlight what\n\nhe considered were inconsistencies; I do not agree with counsel. Indeed, on the whole, I\n\npreferred the testimony of the defendants' witnesses. I did not form the impression that\n\nanyone of them, whether from the defendants or from outside the company, were evasive or\n\nnot forthright when they testified.97. Counsel for the plaintiffs had also submitted at length on the issue of whether the\n\ndefendants paid the plaintiffs only against purchase orders as the defendants contended\n\nor, against quotations as well, as the plaintiffs contended. I shall deal with this issue\n\nnow when I consider Jacqueline's testimony.98. The evidence from Jacqueline, both in her written testimony as well as in the\n\nwitness stand was, that the defendants only recognised their own purchase orders as a\n\nbasis for payment to the plaintiffs; she never wavered from this stand, contrary to the\n\nsubmissions of counsel for the plaintiffs. What she did say however was, that sometimes,\n\nthe defendants would recognise the plaintiffs' quotations by taking them into account in\n\nthe final accounts for a particular project and in those instances no purchase orders were\n\nissued by the defendants. Before the parties' relationship soured, they adopted a 'give\n\nand take' attitude with one and another. This was not only not denied by the plaintiffs\n\nbut indeed was confirmed by the first plaintiff (see N/E 292). On his part, the second\n\nplaintiff had testified (N/E 23) that he had agreed with Lamine that because the\n\nplaintiffs had 20 projects from the defendants, once work was completed,we will sort\n\nit out in final accounts.99. The expectation of final accounting however did not materialise because the\n\nplaintiffs demanded $200,000 from Jacqueline before they would carry on with the\n\nAir-France project. Jacqueline testified she refused to accede to the demand because she\n\nhad already paid the plaintiffs a deposit of $80,000 and $210,000 was the total value of\n\nthat contract. She felt the plaintiffs were attempting to hold her to ransom (which they\n\nwere) and she decided that enough was enough even though she was aware that refusing their\n\nunreasonable demand meant that she had to find another contractor, with the consequential\n\ndelay, to finish the Air-France project. As it turned out, that was what happened and the\n\nplaintiffs were 3 months' late in completing the project. When I suggested to Jacqueline\n\nat one point whether low pricing was possibly the reason she continued to use the\n\nplaintiffs' services, Jacqueline said it was not. Indeed, it was David Chua's testimony\n\n(N/E 642) that the plaintiffs' prices were inflated and their quotations were least 30%\n\nmore than what the defendants issued in their purchase orders. He added that the\n\nplaintiffs' quotations leave a lot of room for negotiations. Jacqueline had also testified\n\nthat at the beginning, the quality of the plaintiffs' work was reasonable/acceptable but\n\nit deteriorated over time when more projects were given to them. Sometimes it was a\n\nquestion of having to put up with the plaintiffs as she could not get another contractor\n\nto take over from them mid-stream for an on-going project. As for the plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint that their resources were stretched because of having to do so many projects\n\nwhich often overlapped, Jacqueline's answer (see N/E 729) was short and to the point --\n\nwhy take them on if the plaintiffs could not cope? They could have but they did not, turn\n\ndown the projects; no one forced them to accept.100. Yet another complaint made by the plaintiffs and repeated by their counsel was,\n\nthat the defendants sometimes did not pay a cent on certain projects, Hugo Boss being an\n\nexample. Again this allegation is untrue. The plaintiffs conveniently omitted to take into\n\naccount (according to David Chua) the general advances made by the defendants periodically\n\ntotalling $400,000 to tide them over their cash flow problem (N/E 646). Counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs also sought to suggest that it was the defendants who had cash-flow problems,\n\nresulting in their inability to pay the plaintiffs. I reject that suggestion as being\n\nunfounded, save for a brief period during the regional economic crisis. In any event, as\n\nJacqueline pointed out, she paid the plaintiffs using her own personal cheques (for\n\nDragages and Air-France) if the defendants were indeed short of funds (N/E 765).101. Counsel for the plaintiffs had also complained that it was unfair of the\n\ndefendants not to settle the final accounts for the various projects and thereby withhold\n\npayment from his clients. In this regard he had apparently overlooked Jacqueline's\n\nevidence which I accept–that the defendants did not\n\nhave the chance to sort out the final accounts for the various projects because the\n\nplaintiffs ceased all works for and communications with, the defendants on or after 2\n\nMarch 1999. In any case, the plaintiffs blew hot and cold -- where there were final\n\naccounts as in the case of Renault, they denied the same because the accounts were\n\nunfavourable to them.102. I turn next to Jacqueline's testimony. She came across as a remarkably capable\n\nwoman whose background in construction enabled her to run the defendants' business\n\nsuccessfully. I cannot imagine that the exclusive French clientele which she secured for\n\nthe defendants is solely due to her being a French national. I am certain it was because\n\nshe does a good job and takes pride in what she does even though she has other\n\nresponsibilities (which includes being a trade advisor to the French government for\n\nSingapore and being the vice-chairperson of the French Business Association). This was\n\nexemplified in her candid apology (N/E 671) in court for the 'terrible work' done for\n\nPublicis which she considered unacceptable. She was equally candid when she testified that\n\nbecause Lamine was more than an employee, he was less accountable to her (N/E 677).\n\nJacqueline's testimony was unshaken under cross-examination and as stated earlier, I did\n\nnot form the impression she was not telling the truth, or that she was evasive or\n\ninconsistent, throughout the considerable period she was in the witness box. Equally, it\n\nis to Jacqueline's credit that notwithstanding her personal relationship with Lamine had\n\nbroken down, she gave him (through David Chua) a testimonial (see exhibit P9) and a\n\ngratuity of $12,000 when he left the defendants' services. Unfortunately, Lamine repaid\n\nher generosity by changing camps.",
        "Conclusion": "103. To conclude, I find that on a balance of probabilities, the defendants have proven\n\ntheir counterclaim whereas the plaintiffs have failed to discharge their burden to prove\n\nthat all the work (save for those admitted by the defendants) encompassed in their\n\nquotations were done or, that those quotations were indeed sent around the dates stated\n\ntherein, to the defendants. I had pointed out to counsel that the plaintiffs' quotations\n\nare not sacrosanct as he seemed to think–his clients\n\nnot only had to prove that the quotations were sent to the defendants but also that the\n\nsame were accepted and, the work described in the documents was carried out. What emerged\n\nfrom the evidence adduced in court was, that a large number of the quotations were not\n\ncontemporaneous but were issuedwell aftertheir supposed dates, they were not sent\n\nto the defendants but were handed to David Chua (on or about 6 January 1999) or, were only\n\nseen by the defendants for the first time in April 2000.104. Accordingly the plaintiffs' claim is dismissed. From the time counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs amended his pleadings to reflect the correct position that the plaintiffs, not\n\nthe company were the claimants, the defendants had (in their amended Defence and\n\nCounterclaim) not disputed that they owed the plaintiffs the balance outstanding on the\n\nprojects in question (save for EURO RSCG, AXA and Renault). Had the plaintiffs formulated\n\ntheir claim properly for the undisputed balance owed to them from the very beginning, the\n\ntrial may well have been obviated. Unfortunately, the plaintiffs went further than that\n\nand attempted to claim more than their entitlement on which they failed. Accordingly, in\n\nthe exercise of my discretion, I deny the plaintiffs any costs.105. On the other hand, the defendants have succeeded on their counterclaim. I\n\ntherefore award them interlocutory judgment with damages to be assessed by the Registrar;\n\nassessment would include the overpayments they claimed to have made to the plaintiffs on\n\nEURO RSCG and AXA. Accordingly, they are entitled to their costs from the plaintiffs and\n\nsuch costs would include any court fees which I had previously ordered them to pay. In\n\nthis regard, I direct that the defendants are entitled to retain the security for costs of\n\n$100,000 previously furnished by the company until such time as the defendants' costs are\n\ntaxed on a standard basis or otherwise agreed106. In the event the parties encounter any difficulties arising out of my decision, I\n\ngive them liberty to apply.Lai Siu ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
