        "Background to the dispute": "3 The Applicant was a director and beneficial owner of Neptune Ship Management Pte Ltd (“Neptune”).2Foot Note 2×Affidavit of Muhd Nur Hidayat Bin Amir dated 28 March 2023 (“DPP’s Affidavit”) at para 6.Incorporated in Singapore, Neptune provided ship management and handling services.3Foot Note 3×Affidavit of Kottakki Srinivas Patnaik dated 10 February 2023 (“Applicant’s Affidavit”) at para 6; DPP’s Affidavit at para 6. 4 The Criminal Proceedings against the Applicant relate to his involvement as a bribe-giver in a private sector corruption scheme between 2011 and 2016 (the “Corruption Scheme”). The charges stated in SC-906994-2022 (the “Charges”) include:4Foot Note 4×DPP’s Affidavit at pp 12–17. (a) five counts of corruptly giving gratification to one Harish Singhal (“Harish”) under s 6(b) of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241, 1993 Rev Ed) (“PCA”), read with s 124(4) of the Criminal Procedure Code 2010 (2020 Rev Ed) (“CPC”); and (b) one count of conspiring with Harish and three other individuals known to Harish, namely “Gaurav Gupta”, “Dhiman Chodhaury” and “Sudhir Kumar Jain” (collectively, “Harish's Three Other Associates”) to disguise the proceeds of Harish 's criminal conduct under s 47(l)(a) of the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act 1992 (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”), punishable under s 47(6)(a) of the CDSA read with s 109 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“PC”) and s 124(4) of the CPC. 5 The Applicant and the AG disputed the facts upon which the Charges are founded.",
        "The AG’s position on the facts": "6 The AG’s factual position was as follows. The Applicant caused Neptune to enter several ship handling and management services contracts (the “Contracts”) with MODEC Offshore Production Systems (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“MOPS”), an oil and gas company incorporated in Singapore. At the material time, Harish was a Construction Manager at MOPS.5Foot Note 5×DPP’s Affidavit at paras 6–7. 7 Investigations by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”) revealed that the Applicant had agreed to give kickbacks to Harish, in exchange for Harish securing MOPS’s award of the Contracts to Neptune at an inflated price.6Foot Note 6×DPP’s Affidavit at para 7. 8 The kickbacks were paid by the Applicant, through Neptune, to Harish. Harish received these moneys through companies controlled by him; his colleague at MOPS, namely one Gopinath Kuppusamy (“Gopinath”); and/or Harish’s Three Other Associates. These companies are identified in the Charges as: (a) Staghorn Marine Services, incorporated in Dubai (“Staghorn Marine Dubai”);(b) Staghorn Marine Services Pvt Ltd, incorporated in India; and(c) Staghorn Marine Services Pte Ltd, incorporated in Singapore (“Staghorn Singapore”). Fictitious invoices were also issued to Neptune to disguise some of the bribes.7Foot Note 7×DPP’s Affidavit at para 7. 9 From 2011 to 2016, the total amount of gratification given by the Applicant (in his capacity as a director of Neptune) to Harish was more than US$1m.8Foot Note 8×DPP’s Affidavit at para 7. 10 The Public Prosecutor (“PP”) also brought charges against Harish and Gopinath for their roles in the Corruption Scheme.9Foot Note 9×DPP’s Affidavit at paras 10(a)(i), 10(a)(iii), 10(b)(i) and pp 19–23, 28, 30–32.Additional charges have also been brought against Harish and Gopinath for their roles in a separate cheating scheme (the “Additional Charges”). This cheating scheme involved a conspiracy to conceal Harish’s interest in Staghorn Singapore from MOPS, in order to induce MOPS to make payments to Staghorn Singapore.10Foot Note 10×DPP’s Affidavit at paras 10(a)(ii), 10(b)(ii) and pp 24–27, 33.The Additional Charges do not involve the Applicant or Neptune. However, they do mention one Kuppusamy Parthiban (“Parthiban”), who was a nominee director and shareholder of Staghorn Singapore at the material time in relation to the Charges.11Foot Note 11×DPP’s Affidavit at para 12. 11 As of the hearing of this case, no charges had been brought against Parthiban and Harish's Three Other Associates. The latter are based overseas and have been uncooperative with the CPIB.",
        "The Applicant’s position on the facts": "12 The Applicant denied that he had given kickbacks to Harish.12Foot Note 12×Applicant’s Affidavit at para 8.He insisted that Harish had not received any moneys from himself or Neptune.13Foot Note 13×Applicant’s Affidavit at para 7.",
        "The parties’ case": "13 Pursuant to O 24 r 5(3)(a) of the Rules of Court 2021 (“ROC 2021”), the Applicant filed a statement setting out, among other things, the relief he sought and the grounds on which it was sought (the “Applicant’s Statement”).14Foot Note 14×Applicant’s Statement dated 10 February 2023 (“Applicant’s Statement”).In the Applicant’s Statement, he stated that the Charges brought against him were in breach of Arts 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution.15Foot Note 15×Applicant’s Statement at paras 27 and 28.Additionally, the Charges were unlawful and irrational as the PP had “singled out [the Applicant] based on assumptions, without taking the evidence and having an assumptive causation.”16Foot Note 16×Applicant’s Statement at para 26.The PP had hence acted unlawfully and/or irrationally and, consequently, was in breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution.17Foot Note 17×Applicant’s Statement at para 29. 14 In the Applicant’s Written Submissions, the Applicant also submitted that Art 12(1) of the Constitution had also been breached by the PP’s selective investigation –ie, that other parties who were involved in the Corruption Scheme which founded the Charges had not been investigated.18Foot Note 18×Applicant’s Written Submissions dated 15 May 2023 (“Applicant’s Written Submissions”) at paras 3–6. 15 The AG submitted that the burden was on the Applicant to prove aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion, in line with the presumption of constitutionality afforded to executive actions:RamalingamRavinthran v Attorney-General[2012] 2 SLR 49 (“Ramalingam”) at [44]–[47];MuhammadRidzuan bin Mohd Ali v Attorney-General[2015] 5 SLR 1222 (“Ridzuan”) at [36].19Foot Note 19×Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 15 May 2023 at para 14.As the Applicant was unable to establish aprima faciecase that there was an abuse of power or a breach of Arts 12(1), 12(2), and/or 35(8), OA 122 should be dismissed.20Foot Note 20×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 4.",
        "Issues to be determined": "16 The Applicant’s Prayers (a) and (b) for permission to apply for a prohibiting order and quashing order pursuant to O 24 r 5(1)(b) of the ROC 2021 were, in effect, applications for permission to commence judicial review. As such, the requirements that must be satisfied for the court to grant such permission guide the issues to be determined in OA 122. 17 These requirements were set out by the Court of Appeal inGobi a/lAvedian and another v Attorney-General and another appeal[2020] 2 SLR 883 (“Gobi”) at [44] (referencingLeePheng Lip Ian v Chen Fun Gee and others[2020] 1 SLR 586 at [24] andWong Souk Yee v Attorney-General[2019] 1 SLR 1223 at [85]) (the “Requirements”): (a) the subject matter of the complaint has to be susceptible to judicial review;(b) the applicant has to have a sufficient interest in the matter; and(c) the materials before the court have to disclose an arguable orprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion in favour of granting the remedies sought by the applicant. 18 In the present case, the first two Requirements were not in dispute. Based on the Applicant’s Statement, the key issue which arose in relation to Prayers (a) and (b) pertained to the third Requirement –ie, whether the materials before me disclosed an arguable orprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to bring the Charges against the Applicant was: (a) a breach of Arts 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution; and(b) unlawful and/or irrational as it was not based on any conclusive proof. 19 In relation to (a), although the Applicant stated that there was a breach of both Arts 12(1) and 12(2) of the Constitution in the Applicant’s Statement, no written or oral submissions on the breach of Art 12(2) were presented by the Applicant. There was hence no submission for the AG to respond to in relation to a breach of Art 12(2) and no submissions were made by the AG. As the Applicant did not take up this issue, it was not necessary to consider whether there was aprima faciecase of a breach of Art 12(2) of the Constitution. 20 In considering this third Requirement, it is useful to bear in mind, that as the Court of Appeal inRidzuanheld at [36], the burden is on the “person who challenges an executive decision based on an alleged breach of one or more of the fundamental liberties enshrined in the Constitution or based on other grounds of review established in administrative law”. While the threshold of proof for an application for leave to commence judicial review is “a very low one of aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion … this does not mean that the evidence and arguments placed before the court can be either skimpy or vague and bare assertions will not suffice”:Gobiat [54], referencing [44] therein. 21 Prayer (c) was an application for adeclarationthat the bringing of the Charges against the Applicant amounted to a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution. Order 24 rule 5(1) of the ROC 2021 provides that: 5.—(1) An application for a Mandatory Order, Prohibiting Order or Quashing Order — (a) may include an application for a declaration which is ancillary to or consequential upon the Order; but (b) must not be made, unless permission to make the application for the Order has been granted. In other words, the success of Prayer (c) was consequential upon the success of Prayers (a) and/or (b). This was emphasised inXu Yuan Chen v Attorney-General[2022] 2 SLR 1131 (“Xu Yuan Chen”), where the court held at [21] that the appellant there “[could not] begrantedthe [d]eclaration under O 53 of the ROC 2021 unless he first succeeds in obtaining leave to apply for the [p]rohibiting [o]rders”. 22 In summary, the issues to be determined were: (a) whether the materials before me disclosed an arguable orprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion to bring the Charges against the Applicant was: (i) a breach of Art 12(1) of the Constitution;(ii) unlawful and/or irrational as the Charges were not based on any conclusive evidence; and (b) if so, whether there was a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution.",
        "Issue 1: Whether there was aprima faciecase that Art 12(1) had been breached": "23 As a preliminary matter, the AG highlighted that pursuant to O 24 r 5(4) of the ROC 2021, the Applicant is bound by the grounds and relief set out in his statement and may not rely on any ground not set out in the statement unless the Court otherwise allows.21Foot Note 21×Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 15 May 2023 (“Defendant’s Written Submissions”) at para 14.In this case, the Applicant had in his Written Submissions, relied on additional grounds that were not set out in the Applicant’s Statement –ie, in relation to selective investigations constituting a breach of Art 12 (see [14] above). Consequently, the AG did not have the opportunity to respond to these grounds in his affidavit. Notwithstanding, the AG responded to these grounds in his written submissions and during the hearing.22Foot Note 22×Defendant’s Written Submissions at paras 9 and 26; Notes of Evidence for the Hearing on 22 May 2023 (“Notes of Evidence”) at p 2, line 27 to p 4, line 10.I will hence proceed to consider them.",
        "The applicable law": "24 Article 12(1) of the Constitution states that, “[a]ll persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law.” 25 The Court of Appeal has provided extensive guidance on the consideration of applications for leave to commence judicial review for breach of Art 12(1). InXu Yuan Chen, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal and upheld the High Court’s dismissal of the appellant’s application for leave to commence judicial review on the basis that the appellant had not shown aprima faciebreach of Art 12(1). In dismissing the appeal, the Court of Appeal held at [1], citingAttorney-General vDatchinamurthy a/l Kataiah[2022] SGCA 46 (“Datchinamurthy”) at [29], that “the concept of equality under Art 12(1) does not mean that all persons are to be treated equally, but simply that all personsin like situationswill be treated alike” [emphasis in original]. 26 Additionally, the Court of Appeal inDatchinamurthyreiterated at [29] the two-step test that has been developed in our local jurisprudence to determine whether executive action breaches Art 12(1) (referencingSyed Suhail bin Syed Zin v Attorney-General[2021] 1 SLR 809 at [61]–[62]): (a) the applicant must first discharge his evidential burden of showing that he has been treated differently from other equally situated persons; (b) the evidential burden then shifts to the decision-maker in question to show that the differential treatment was reasonable, in that it was based on legitimate reasons which made the differential treatment proper. 27 In ascertaining whether persons are “equally situated”, the Court of Appeal further held at [30] that: … the court [will] have regard to the nature of the executive action in question (seeSyed Suhail (CA)at [63] andTan Seng Keeat [327]) and consider whether, in that context, the persons being compared are so situated that it is reasonable to consider that they should be similarly treated. … the test is a factual one of whether a prudent person would objectively think the persons concerned are roughly equivalent or similarly situated in all material respects … Here, the notion of being equally situated is ‘an analytical tool used to isolate the purported rationale for differential treatment, so that its legitimacy may then be assessed properly’… 28 Further guidance on the application of this test, in the context of applications for leave to commence judicial review on the ground of breach of Art 12(1) in criminal proceedings, is found in the Court of Appeal decisions inRidzuanandSyed Suhail. 29 InRidzuan,two people were convicted of the same charges for trafficking in drugs; however, only one was granted a certificate of substantive assistance. The appellant sought leave to commence judicial review proceedings against the Prosecution’s decision not to grant him the same certificate, claiming that his Art 12 rights had consequently been breached. The Court of Appeal held at [51] that the applicant could satisfy his evidential burden by showing: (a) that his level of involvement in the offence and the consequent knowledge he had acquired of the drug syndicate he was dealing with was “practically identical to” that of the co-offender, and (b) that he and his co-offender had provided “practically the same information” to the Central Narcotics Bureau – yet only the co-offender was given the certificate. This would constitute aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion of breach. Only then would the evidential burden shift to the Prosecution to justify its decision. 30 InSyed Suhail, the appellant filed an application for leave to commence judicial review to obtain a prohibiting order against the Singapore Prison Service to stay his execution. He alleged that he had been scheduled for execution ahead of other prisoners who had been sentenced to death before him and that this breached Art 12. The Court of Appeal considered that prisoners mayprima faciebe regarded as being equally situated once they have been denied clemency (at [64]). The Court also accepted as a rational baseline the State’s position as to what equal treatment entailed – namely, that all else being equal, prisoners whose executions arose for scheduling should be executed in the order in which they were sentenced to death (at [72]). Another prisoner, Datchinamurthy, had been scheduled for execution later than the appellant, despite having been sentenced to death before the appellant (at [75]). It appeared that no differentiating factors were available to justify the differential treatment of the appellant and Datchinamurthy (at [76]). The Court found that the appellant had made out aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion, and granted leave to commence judicial review proceedings (at [77]).",
        "The parties’ submissions": "31 The Applicant submitted that the Prosecution’s bringing of the Charges against him constituted a breach of Art 12(1) as other parties that were involved in the Corruption Scheme upon which the Charges were founded were not investigated (ie, selective investigation). 32 The Applicant claimed that there were no payments from his bank accounts or from Neptune to Harish.23Foot Note 23×Applicant’s Written Submissions at para 27.As such, payments to Harish could only have been made by Staghorn Singapore. Harish’s interest in Staghorn Singapore was concealed to induce MOPS to make payments to Staghorn Singapore. This formed the basis of the Additional Charges against Harish and Gopinath. Yet, Parthiban, who was named in the Additional Charges (see [10] above), had not been investigated by the Prosecution.24Foot Note 24×Applicant’s Written Submissions at para 3.Additionally, the Applicant submitted that there had been no investigation into, among other things, the relationship between Staghorn Singapore and MOPS, why Staghorn Singapore was able to influence MOPS to award contracts to Neptune, and the relationship between persons who represented MOPS in its entry into contracts with Neptune and Staghorn Singapore.25Foot Note 25×Applicant’s Written Submissions at paras, 4, 12, and 14.Further, the Applicant highlighted that Harish’s Three Other Associates had not been investigated or prosecuted at the time of the hearing.26Foot Note 26×Applicant’s Written Submissions at paras 18 and 25. 33 In response, the AG submitted that the Applicant’s submission that there had been a breach of Art 12(1) was a non-starter. The Applicant was the only bribe-giver in the Corruption Scheme.27Foot Note 27×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 26.In addition, Harish and Gopinath (who, amongst other things, conspired to accept the bribes), were charged according to the evidence and the applicable offences that could be made out on the evidence. The controlling minds in the Corruption Scheme which grounded the Charges had been charged.28Foot Note 28×Notes of Evidence at p 3.Further, the Applicant had not identified any possible equally situated person who had been treated differently or more favourably by the PP.29Foot Note 29×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 26. 34 In relation to Harish's Three Other Associates, the AG’s evidence was that they were based overseas and were uncooperative with the CPIB.30Foot Note 30×DPP’s Affidavit at para 12.In investigating and deciding whether to prosecute Harish’s Three Other Associates, the Prosecution considered the difficulties in investigation, prosecution, and enforcement against them. As for Parthiban, the AG submitted that the Prosecution would be taking into account the evidence of Parthiban’s level of involvement and knowledge in the corruption dealings and other relevant factors and would assess what action to take after the criminal proceedings against the Applicant, Harish, and Gopinath are concluded.31Foot Note 31×DPP’s Affidavit at para 12.",
        "Decision": "55 It is trite law that the Prosecution is not obliged to prove the Charges beyond reasonable doubt at this stage of the Criminal Proceedings. Importantly, the forum where the discharge of the Prosecution’s burden of proof is to take place, is at the criminal trial. If the Applicant wishes to challenge the evidence against him, he will have the right and opportunity to do so in the criminal proceedings. 56 Additionally, as held by the Court of Appeal inRamalingamat [74], the AG is not under any general obligation to disclose his reasons for making a particular prosecutorial decision. More fundamentally, the court should presume that the AG’s prosecutorial decisions are constitutional or lawful until they are shown to be otherwise:Ramalingamat [44]. The Applicant had not shown otherwise here. 57 For completeness, the Applicant had not identified an improper purpose that the Prosecution was acting on by bringing the Charges. Additionally, even if the Applicant was a whistle-blower, that fact may go towards sentencing, but it did not preclude the Prosecution from proceeding with the Charges.",
        "Issue 2: Whether there was aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion that theCharges were unlawful and/or irrational because they have not been proved beyond reasonable doubt": "48 The other plank of the Applicant’s case was that there was aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion that the Charges were unlawful and/or irrational.  The Applicant claims that the exercise of prosecutorial discretion against him was biased and unfair as the Charges were not based on any conclusive proof and that the Prosecution had not proven the charges against him beyond reasonable doubt. 49 The Applicant stated that the charges framed against him are factually incorrect. In particular, the Applicant claimed that there was no evidence that he had given bribes to Harish – he was not the bribe-giver – and maintained that Harish had not received any moneys from him or Neptune. The Applicant submitted that there was no objective evidence or documentary proof of the alleged Corruption Scheme and kickbacks to Harish.36Foot Note 36×Applicant’s Written Submissions at paras 7–8 and 10.In support of his claims, the Applicant highlighted that there were no work reports listing Harish as a recipient. The AG was put to strict proof of payments from him to Harish.37Foot Note 37×Applicant’s Statement at para 20.The Applicant posited that he was a whistle-blower who exposed the corruption within MOPS, and the Prosecution in bringing the Charges against him was penalising him for being a whistle-blower.38Foot Note 38×Applicant’s Affidavit at paras 7 and 12. 50 The Applicant also submitted that evidence of the Charges must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before the Charges could be brought against him. This standard was not met.39Foot Note 39×Applicant’s Written Submissions at paras 20.In particular, the Applicant submitted that Harish’ Three Other Associates being uncooperative with the CPIB’s investigations implied that there was no proof of conspiracy, as set out in the Charges.40Foot Note 40×Applicant’s Written Submissions at para 26.Hence, the exercise of prosecutorial discretion was biased and unfair as the Charges were not based on any conclusive proof. 51 In response, the AG submitted that there was no obligation on the Prosecution to adduce all the evidence to prove the underlying Charges in this application. This was particularly so as the Applicant had not adduced any evidence to displace the presumption of constitutionality or discharge his burden of proof of showing aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion of abuse of process or breach of constitutional rights.41Foot Note 41×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 19. 52 Further, the AG submitted that the Applicant had not identified how the Prosecution was acting in abuse of power.42Foot Note 42×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 20.Even if the Applicant was a whistle-blower, it would be lawful and proper for the Applicant to be tried on the Charges and found guilty if the Charges were proven. At most, any assistance that the Applicant may give as a whistle-blower could perhaps be relevant to sentencing, but that was separate from the decision to prosecute the Applicant.43Foot Note 43×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 20(a). 53 The AG further submitted that the Prosecution had not acted improperly.44Foot Note 44×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 20(b).The Prosecution had explained that all decisions were taken based on the evidence and considerations of public interest. There was nothing improper in the Prosecution proceeding with the Charges against the Applicant even though the Prosecution was unable to and/or had at this stage decided not to also proceed with charges against other persons involved in or related to the Corruption Scheme, such as, Harish’s Three Other Associates and/or Parthiban. This did not constitute any abuse of power. 54 Additionally, although the DPP’s affidavit stated that Harish’s Three Other Associates had been “uncooperative with the CPIB”, that did not mean that the Prosecution would clearly be unable to discharge its burden of proof at trial. It was open for the Prosecution to rely on other evidence to prove the Charges.45Foot Note 45×Defendant’s Written Submissions at para 20(b).",
        "Issue 3: Whether the bringing of the Charges constituted a breach of Art 35(8) of the Constitution": "58 The Applicant submitted that, as the bringing of the Charges constituted a breach of his rights under Art 12(1) and were irrational and/or unlawful, the AG breached Art 35(8) of the Constitution and thus the applicant sought a declaration of such.46Foot Note 46×Applicant’s Written Submissions at para 4; Applicant’s Affidavit at para 13; Applicant’s Statement at para 29. 59 Article 35(8) of the Constitution states that “[t]he Attorney-General shall have power, exercisable at his discretion, to institute, conduct or discontinue any proceedings for any offence.” 60 In response, the AG submitted that the Applicant’s submission was entirely premised on a breach of Art 12(1) and/or the alleged insufficiency of the evidence in respect of the Charges. As Art 12(1) had not been breached, and the sufficiency of evidence underpinning a prosecutorial decision was not a matter for judicial review in the absence of any abuse of power or breach of constitutional rights, it was clear that the Applicant also had no case on the basis of Art 35(8). 61 Indeed, the Applicant’s case that Art 35(8) was breached was predicated on a breach of Art 12(1) and/or the Charges being brought against him despite lack of proof beyond reasonable doubt. Given my findings above in relation to Issues 1 and 2, I found that there was no basis to the Applicant’s case that there was a breach of Art 35(8). Moreover, in the same vein as held inXu Yuan Chenat [21], since permission had not been granted here for the Applicant to apply for the prohibiting and quashing orders, the Applicant’s prayer for the declaration also fell away,perO 24 r 5(1)(b) of the ROC 2021.",
        "Conclusion": "62 For the reasons above, I dismissed OA 122. The daily tariff for judicial review applications under Appendix G are in the range of $14,000–$35,000. The AG asked for costs at $6,000 all-in, inclusive of disbursements of more than $800, while the Applicant submitted for $5,000 all-in. Taking into account that the work done includes the filing of an affidavit, and both writtenandoral submissions, costs were awarded to the AG in the sum of $5,500 all-in. Kwek Mean LuckJudge of the High Court Lim Tean (Carson Law Chambers) for the applicant; Gan Yingtian Andrea and Zhicong Lee (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the respondent."
