        "Background": "1. Overseas Chinese Banking Corporation Ltd (the plaintiffs) are a bank\n\ncarrying on business at No. 65 Chulia Street, OCBC Centre, Singapore 049513 and elsewhere.\n\nKon Hong Shin (the second defendant) is an accountant by profession. He was a director of\n\na Singapore company known as Top Test International Pte Ltd (Top Test) from March 1995 to\n\n17 September 1996. Tan Geok Ser (the first defendant) was at the material time, an\n\nadvocate and solicitor and a director of Top Test.2. In February 1995, the defendants approached the plaintiffs with a\n\nview to obtaining a loan to acquire shares in a company called Credit Development Pte Ltd\n\n(CDPL). The defendants represented to the plaintiffs that an arrangement had been reached\n\nbetween the first defendant and a Hong Kong company trading under the name Great World\n\nInvestment Ltd (Great World) whereby the purchase of the CDPL shares was to be completed\n\nby Top Test. The defendants also represented that they would be appointed directors of Top\n\nTest prior to the execution of the share purchase.3. On 30 March 1995, a loan agreement was concluded whereby the\n\nplaintiffs agreed to grant credit facilities to Top Test to purchase 27,187,498 shares in\n\nCDPL. The credit facilities were in the form of an overdraft facility of $35m and a term\n\nloan of $45.8m. The credit facilities were secured by a joint and several deed of\n\nguarantee executed by the defendants in favour of the plaintiffs and a charge over the\n\nCDPL shares. In addition, the parties agreed that the loan would also be secured through a\n\nmortgage over the properties of CDPL pursuant to a financial assistance scheme made under\n\ns 76(10) of the Companies Act Cap 50 (the Scheme). The giving of financial assistance\n\npursuant to the Scheme was approved by Top Test in an Extraordinary General Meeting held\n\non 18 August 1995. The loan of $80.8m to Top Test was expected to be repaid within 3\n\nyears.4. After the plaintiffs had disbursed the loan monies, the defendants\n\nrefused to provide security in accordance with the Scheme. In fact, they tried to convince\n\nthe plaintiffs to agree to abandon the Scheme altogether. The plaintiffs subsequently\n\nrealised that the defendants never intended to proceed with the Scheme at all.5. In October 1995, CDPL was voluntarily wound-up. On 4 and 15 December\n\n1995, the plaintiffs' solicitors wrote to the defendants reminding them that under the\n\nterms of the loan agreement, Top Test was obliged to repay a sum of S$17.5m with accrued\n\ninterest by 30 December 1995. The plaintiffs also insisted that the winding up of CDPL\n\n(part of the Scheme) be concluded by 28 February 1996.6. On 16 December 1995, the defendants gave 2 cheques for S$12m and\n\nS$8m to the plaintiffs. They stated that the S$12m originated from a joint account which\n\nthey maintained at the plaintiffs' High Street branch. At a meeting between the plaintiffs\n\nand the defendants held on 18 December 1995, one Loo Choon Beng (Loo), a consultant of Top\n\nTest, handed 2 cheques totalling S$20m to the plaintiffs. Loo informed the plaintiffs that\n\nthe said cheques could be utilised to reduce Top Test's outstanding debts under the loan\n\nagreement in the event the plaintiffs did not want to use the cheques issued by the\n\ndefendants.7. Ultimately, the plaintiffs only cashed the cheque for S$12m that had\n\nbeen issued by the defendants. The cheques that were given by Loo were not presented for\n\npayment as the plaintiffs were rather wary of their origins. The cheque for S$8m was also\n\nnot cashed as it represented CDPL's monies.8. On 20 December 1995, the plaintiffs reminded the defendants that\n\nS$8m was still due and owing to them. However, the defendants failed to make full payment\n\nby 30 December 1995.9. On 3 January 1996, the plaintiffs sent the defendants a letter of\n\ndemand in respect of the remaining sums due and gave Top Test 14 days to pay the\n\noutstanding amounts. On 15 January 1996, Top Test wrote to the plaintiffs giving notice of\n\ntheir intention to repay the outstanding loan. However, Top Test failed to make any\n\npayments to the plaintiffs within the deadline stipulated.10. After the expiry of the 14-day deadline, it was revealed that the\n\nS$12m cheque that was presented to the plaintiffs had been drawn on funds that belonged to\n\nCDPL. At this point in time, the plaintiffs had already received the proceeds of the\n\ncheque. They immediately placed the proceeds into a suspense account pending further\n\ninvestigations.11. On 23 January 1996, the plaintiffs wrote to Top Test informing the\n\nlatter that their notice to redeem was ineffective. On 29 January 1996, the plaintiffs'\n\nsolicitors wrote a letter of demand to Top Test to pay $80.8m with accrued interest.12. On 31 January 1996, a winding-up petition was filed by\n\nOverseas-Chinese Bank Nominees (OCBN) against CDPL on the grounds that the directors of\n\nCDPL had acted in the affairs of CDPL in their own interests rather than in the interests\n\nof CDPL members as a whole. On the same day, the defendants resigned as directors of CDPL.13. On 5 February 1996, the plaintiffs wrote to the second defendant\n\ndemanding payment under the guarantee.14. On 9 February 1996, CDPL commenced Suit No 268 of 1996 against OCBC\n\nseeking the return of the S$12m. CDPL claimed that the defendants acted in breach of their\n\nfiduciary duties to CDPL by paying the plaintiffs the said S$12m. On 11 July 1996, Top\n\nTest commenced Suit No 1256 of 1996 against the plaintiffs, OCBN and OCBC Nominees. In\n\nthis particular action, Top Test sought a declaration that they were not in default of the\n\nrepayment terms under the loan agreement and they were entitled to redeem the existing\n\nmortgage over the CDPL shares. From August 1996 onwards, the parties to the various legal\n\nactions commenced negotiations with a view to a settlement. Eventually, a settlement\n\nagreement was concluded between the plaintiffs, OCBN, OCBC Nominees, Top Test, CDPL and\n\none Keen Land Limited on 12 November 1997.15. The plaintiffs sent another letter of demand to the second\n\ndefendant sometime in February 2000. On 30 March 2000, the plaintiffs made an application\n\nfor summary judgment against the defendants. In view of Top Test's failure to repay the\n\nloan of S$80.8m, the plaintiffs argued that they had an undisputed claim against the\n\ndefendants under the terms of the guarantee. They stated that the defendants' defence did\n\nnot raise any triable issues. The assistant registrar dismissed the plaintiffs'\n\napplication with costs and gave the defendants leave to defend.The appeal16. On appeal, the plaintiffs reiterated their position that the\n\ndefences to their claim did not raise any triable issues. They further stated that even if\n\nthe allegations of fact against the plaintiffs were true, the remaining questions of law\n\ncould be determined summarily. Accordingly, they submitted that the learned assistant\n\nregistrar erred in granting the defendants leave to defend.17. In substance, the defences that were raised by the second defendant\n\nwere, that he was discharged from his obligations under the guarantee as a result of:-(a) material variations to the loan agreement that were executed by the\n\n  plaintiffs without his prior consent;(b) the conclusion of a settlement agreement dated 11 November 1997\n\n  which superseded the loan agreement and the guarantee;(c) bad faith and unconscionable conduct on the part of the plaintiffs,\n\n  in particular, their failure to sell the CDPL shares to recover part of the loan; and(d) wrongful declaration of event of default by the plaintiffs.Material variation of the loan agreement18. The second defendant argued that it was an implied term of the\n\nguarantee that the terms and performance of the loan agreement would not be materially\n\naltered without his prior consent. He claimed that the terms of the settlement agreement\n\nof 12 November 1997 varied the performance of the loan agreement by providing for the sale\n\nof the shares in CDPL to Network Entertainment Group Limited of Australia. Further, the\n\npayment terms of the loan agreement were altered as Top Test was given time to pay the\n\namounts owing to the plaintiffs under the settlement agreement. In view of such\n\nvariations, the second defendant submitted that he was discharged from his obligations\n\nunder the guarantee.19. The plaintiffs argued that even if the second defendant's\n\nallegations in this respect were true, there was no basis to imply a term in the guarantee\n\nin the manner contemplated by the second defendant. Such an implied term would be\n\ninconsistent with the express terms of the guarantee, in particular cl 8 which provides:This guarantee shall not be prejudiced, diminished or affected in any\n\n  way nor shall we nor any of us be released or exonerated by any of the matters following:(a) any increase, decrease, extension, renewal or restructure of all or\n\n    any of the loans…given to the customer from time to time whether solely or jointly\n\n    with any person or persons…and whether beyond the said limit or otherwise or any\n\n    variation of any terms and conditions thereof with or without notice to us;…(d) any time forbearance, concession or other indulgence given or\n\n    extended to the customer and/or to any party to any guarantee, indemnity, security or\n\n    other instrument in respect of any monies hereby guaranteed all of which you are at\n\n    liberty to give whether with or without our consent or notice to us;(e) any compromise, composition or arrangement made with the customer\n\n    and/or any other person or persons all of which you are at liberty to make whether with or\n\n    without our consent or notice to us.20. In my view, it is clear that the terms of the guarantee expressly\n\npermitted the creditor to vary the terms of the loan agreement without first notifying or\n\nobtaining the consent of the guarantor. It is also clear that such variation can be\n\ncarried out without affecting the guarantor's obligations under the guarantee in any way.21. Further, I did not think that the decision inDunlop New Zealand\n\nLimited v Dumbleton[1968] NZLR 1092(Dunlop), upon which the second defendant\n\nplaced heavy reliance, was useful. InDunlop, the Supreme Court of New Zealand held\n\nthat the guarantor was discharged from his obligations under the guarantee as a result of\n\na substantial variation to the loan agreement without the knowledge of the guarantor. I\n\nnoted that the facts inDunlopdiffered from that of the present case. InDunlop,\n\nthe guarantee did not contain an express reservation of the creditor's rights. In\n\ncontrast, cl 8 of the guarantee in this case clearly preserved the plaintiffs' rights\n\nagainst the defendants in the event of a unilateral variation to the loan agreement. In\n\nthe circumstances, I did not think thatDunlopassisted the second defendant in any\n\nway.22. For the above reasons, I saw no merit in this particular defence.The settlement agreement23. The second defendant further argued that the settlement agreement\n\nwas a new contract which effectively superseded the loan agreement and the guarantee. The\n\nplaintiffs countered that the terms of the settlement agreement were not inconsistent with\n\nthe loan agreement or the guarantee. In fact, the settlement agreement was premised upon\n\nthe continued operation of the loan agreement and the guarantee and merely provided the\n\nmechanism whereby the plaintiffs were to be repaid. In any case the plaintiffs submitted,\n\ncl 14 of the settlement agreement expressly made it clear that the parties never intended\n\nto rescind the loan agreement and/or the guarantee. Clause 14 of the settlement agreement\n\nprovides:For avoidance of doubt, Top Test and OCBC agree that the terms of the\n\n  Loan Agreement, Mortgage and the Guarantee shall continue to remain in full force and\n\n  effect until the said Sums are paid in full.24. In my opinion, the second defendant's contention in this regard is\n\nuntenable. An earlier agreement is only rescinded where the parties enter into a new\n\nagreement which is entirely inconsistent with the old, or inconsistent with it to such an\n\nextent that goes to the very root of it (seeChitty on Contracts27thed\n\nVol 1 para 22-025 at p 1081). The variations effected by the settlement agreement did not\n\nfundamentally alter the obligations of the various parties under the loan agreement and\n\nthe guarantee. In any case, cl 8(3) of the guarantee unambiguously provided that the\n\ndefendants' obligation under the guarantee would remain intact in the face of any 'compromise,\n\ncomposition or arrangement' amongst the plaintiffs and other parties.25. For the above reasons, I concluded that the second defendant's\n\ndefence in this regard was unsustainable.Bad faith26. The second defendant further submitted that the plaintiffs had lost\n\ntheir rights under the guarantee as they had acted in bad faith. In support of this\n\nargument, his counsel cited the following passage fromSnell's Principles of Equity(28 ed at p 471):-Although surety is not in its inception a contractuberrimae fidei,\n\n  yet once the contract has been entered into the creditor must observe the utmost good\n\n  faith towards the surety. If there are any dealings behind the surety's back, either\n\n  between the creditor and principal debtor or between the creditor and a co-surety or of\n\n  prejudicing the exercise of his rights, this will not only discharge him personally from\n\n  liability, either wholly or partly, but also free any property which he has mortgaged or\n\n  pledged as security for the debt.27. The second defendant alleged that the plaintiffs acted in bad faith\n\nby:(a) enforcing the guarantee even though the second defendant only\n\n  agreed to be a guarantor out of 'moral support';(b) failing to inform the defendants that they did not intend to use\n\n  the cheques provided by Loo;(c) failing to inform the defendants that they did not intend to use\n\n  the cheque for S$8m that was issued by the defendants;(d) wrongfully rejecting Top Test's offer to redeem the loan;(e) failing to inform the second defendant of the settlement\n\n  negotiations and proceeding to enter into the settlement agreement even though the\n\n  defendants were not a party to it; and(f) failing to sell the CDPL shares to recover part of the loan.28. In my opinion, the instances of bad faith that were alleged by the\n\nsecond defendant were not supported by any cogent evidence. Even if the various\n\nallegations were substantiated, I did not think that any of them afforded the second\n\ndefendant a valid defence to the plaintiffs' claim.29. To begin with, the allegation in (a) above was raised only once\n\nsince the guarantee was signed some five (5) years ago. Further, the allegation that he\n\nwas a mere moral supporter was raised by the second defendant only at the very last\n\nminute. Accordingly, I was of the view that the allegation was dubious at best.30. In relation to the allegations in (b) and (c), I did not see any\n\nmerit in them. Common sense dictated that the defendants must have known that the\n\nplaintiffs did not intend to use Loo's cheques and their cheque for S$8m when the\n\nplaintiffs issued their letter of demand on 3 January 1996 demanding the remaining sums\n\ndue to them as at 31 December 1995.31. Further, I did not see the plaintiffs' rejection of Top Test's\n\noffer to redeem the loan to be indicative of bad faith as alleged in (d) above. Top Test\n\nwas clearly in default of its obligations to repay the loan. Top Test failed to make any\n\nrepayment even after the plaintiffs had afforded them a 14-day grace-period to do so. In\n\nthe circumstances, I did not think that Top Test's offer to redeem the loan was anything\n\nother than a futile attempt on their part to buy more time.32. In relation to (e) above, I did not think there was any evidence to\n\nsupport the allegation that the second defendant was not informed of the settlement\n\nnegotiations. In fact, the second defendant was asked to be a party to it (which he\n\nrefused) and was ultimately told about the settlement agreement33. Finally, I did not think that the plaintiffs' failure to sell the\n\nCDPL shares to recover part of the loan amounted to bad faith on their part. It is trite\n\nlaw that a creditor does not owe a surety a duty to realise a security before it became\n\nworthless (seeIndustrial & Commercial Bank v Li Soon Development Pte Ltd[1994] 1 SLR 471andHong Kong, China and South Seas Bank v Tan Goon Sin[1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 113). As stated inHong Kong, China and South Seas Bank v Tan Goon Sin[1990] 1 Lloyd's Rep 113:If the surety…is worried that the mortgaged securities may decline\n\n  in value, then the surety may request the creditor to sell and if the creditor remains\n\n  idle then the surety may bustle about, pay off the debt, take over the benefit of the\n\n  securities and sell them. No creditor could carry on the business of lending if he could\n\n  become liable to a mortgagor and to a surety or to either of them for a decline in the\n\n  value of mortgaged property, unless the creditor was personally responsible for the\n\n  decline…The creditor was not under a duty to exercise his power of sale over the\n\n  mortgaged securities at any particular time or at all.In the premises, the second defendant's allegation that the plaintiffs\n\nacted in bad faith by not selling the CDPL shares cannot be sustained.34. Having examined the evidence and considered the submissions of both\n\nparties, I do not think that the plaintiffs acted in bad faith in their dealings with the\n\ndefendants.Wrongful declaration of event of default35. The second defendant further argued that the plaintiffs had, by\n\nvirtue of the settlement agreement, agreed to settle all existing disputes and\n\nconsequently waived their right to rely on previous events of default. Consequently, the\n\nplaintiffs' declaration of events of default in the circumstances was wrongful.36. In my opinion, there was nothing in the settlement agreement which\n\nsupported the second defendant's view. As stated above (para 23), cl 14 of the settlement\n\nagreement expressly preserved the validity of the loan agreement and the guarantee until a\n\ntime when the loan is fully repaid. Accordingly, the plaintiffs' rights under the loan\n\nagreement and the guarantee remained intact. The settlement agreement merely served as a\n\nmechanism through which the plaintiffs afforded Top Test additional time to repay the\n\noutstanding sums due under the loan, failing which they would take steps to wind-up CDPL\n\nand recover the loan through the liquidation. For the above reasons, it cannot be said\n\nthat the plaintiffs had waived their right to issue declarations of events of default.37. I was of the further opinion that the plaintiffs were clearly\n\nentitled to call an event of default under cl 19(1)(k) of the loan agreement. That clause\n\nprovided that an event of default would occur if Top Test:begins negotiations or takes any proceeding or other step with a view\n\n  to readjustment, rescheduling or deferral of all of its/his indebtedness (or of any part\n\n  of its/his indebtedness which it/he will or might otherwise be unable to pay when due) or\n\n  proposes or makes a general assignment or arrangement or composition with or for the\n\n  benefit of its/his creditors or a moratorium is agreed or declared in respect of or\n\n  affecting all or a material part of its/his indebtedness.38. The second defendant did not dispute that Top Test had, by a letter\n\nto the plaintiffs dated 15 January 1996, made a proposal to restructure the loan. In my\n\nview, Top Test's actions clearly fell within cl 19(1)(k) of the loan agreement.\n\nAccordingly, the plaintiffs were perfectly entitled to declare an event of default under\n\nthe loan agreement.Conclusion39. For the foregoing reasons, I was of the view that the second\n\ndefendant had failed to raise any triable issues that warranted this claim proceeding to\n\ntrial. Accordingly, I allowed the plaintiffs' appeal, reversed the decision made below and\n\nawarded final judgment to the plaintiffs with costs against both defendants on an\n\nindemnity basis. The second defendant has now appealed against my decision (in Civil\n\nAppeal No. 123 of 2000). The first defendant did not file any substantive affidavit in his\n\nown right to resist the plaintiffs' application for summary judgment. Rather, his\n\naffidavit filed on 26 July 2000 referred to and relied on the second defendant's affidavit\n\nand in particular, on the allegations concerning the conduct of the plaintiffs. According\n\nto the first defendant's affidavit, he was recovering from a stroke suffered in November\n\n1999 and was thereby unable to instruct his solicitors properly and sufficiently. However,\n\nthe first defendant has now filed a separate appeal against my decision in Civil Appeal\n\nNo. 132 of 2000.Lai Siu ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
