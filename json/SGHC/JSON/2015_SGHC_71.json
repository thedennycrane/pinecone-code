        "Introduction": "1       On\n12 January 2015, the plaintiff, Tan Poh Chung (“Tan”), filed an application\nto wind up the defendant, Polylectric Engineering Pte Ltd (“the Company”),\non the just and equitable ground and to appoint Mr Leow Quek Shiong\n(“Mr Leow”) of BDO LLP as the liquidator of the Company. Tan holds\n50% of the shares in the Company. He is also one of four directors\nof the Company. 2       The\napplication was resisted by Toong Chuen Piew (“Toong”) and Litemax\nPte Ltd (“Litemax”). Toong holds the other 50% of the shares in the\nCompany and is also one of the four directors of the Company. Litemax is\nToong’s company. It is a judgment creditor of the Company. 3       The\nother two directors of the Company are the wives of Tan and Toong. 4       On\n6 February 2015, I made an order to wind up the Company and to appoint\nMr Leow as liquidator of the Company. Toong has filed an appeal against\nmy decision to the Court of Appeal. I set out below the reasons\nfor my decision.",
        "Issue": "5       The\nmain issue was whether the court should have ordered the Company\nto be wound up.",
        "Background": "6       According\nto Tan, the relationship between Toong and him had deteriorated\nin recent years. Accordingly, both Toong and he agreed to wind up\nthe business of the Company as a practical measure and to distribute\nits assets. They did so by entering into an agreement called the “Agreement\nfor closing of Polylectric Engineering Pte Ltd” dated 11 February\n2014 (“the Closing Agreement”). 7       Under\nthe Closing Agreement, it was agreed that the Company would cease\noperations and transfer existing and new jobs to other companies,ie, Pohlect Pte Ltd (“Pohlect”) owned\nby Tan and Litemax owned by Toong. I need not elaborate on the other\nterms of the Closing Agreement for the time being. 8       On\nor around 23 July 2014, Litemax commenced legal proceedings in Suit\nNo 781 of 2014 (“Suit 781/2014”) to claim a debt of $1,001,983.16 arising\nfrom two unpaid invoices issued by Litemax to the Company for work\ndone by Litemax for the Company. 9       On\n31 July 2014, Tan filed Originating Summons No 743 of 2014 (“OS\n743/2014”) for various reliefs, including the resolution of the\nissue of appointment of solicitors to act on behalf of the Company\nin Suit 781/2014, for Tan to be joined as a defendant in that suit,\nand for a stay of that suit pending the resolution of OS 743/2014.\nAccording to Toong, OS 743/2014 was dismissed by Vinodh Coomaraswamy\nJ on 2 October 2014 on the basis that it was procedurally flawed\nand that the appropriate procedure was for Tan to file an application\nunder the Companies Act in Suit 781/2014 itself. 10     On\n3 October 2014, Litemax obtained judgment in default of appearance\nagainst the Company in Suit 781/2014 (“the Litemax Judgment”). 11     On\n9 October 2014, Tan applied by way of Summons No 5047 of 2014 (“Summons\n5047/2014”) for various reliefs including an order for Tan to be added\nas a defendant in Suit 781/2014. However, his application was dismissed\non 8 January 2015 by an Assistant Registrar (“AR”). According to Toong,\nthe decision was based on procedural missteps by Tan. 12     In\nthe meantime, Litemax filed Summons No 5139 of 2014 on 14 October\n2014 to garnish money held by a bank for the Company. The garnishee\nproceedings have not been completed yet. 13     After\nSummons 5047/2014 was dismissed on 8 January 2015, Tan filed the\npresent application to wind up the Company on 12 January 2015.",
        "The arguments and the court’s\ndecision": "14     Tan’s\nsubmission was that while Litemax did perform services for the Company,\nhe did not accept that the sum owing to Litemax was as much as that\nclaimed by Litemax. He was of the view that the garnishee proceedings were\nan attempt by Litemax to gain an unfair advantage and that the Company\nshould defend the claim. 15     Tan\nalleged that the Company had been dormant for a year and had lost\nthe substratum of its business. He also alleged that in view of\nthe impasse between Toong and him, there was no assurance that the\naffairs of the Company were being managed in an honest and diligent\nmanner. 16     I\ncome now to the submissions for Toong and Litemax. I will refer\nto them as one since Toong owns Litemax. 17     Toong\ndid not dispute that the Company had been dormant for a year. Neither\ndid he dispute that Tan and he had wanted to wind up the business\nof the Company as a practical measure and to distribute its assets. It\nwas not disputed that in such circumstances, a court could, and\nshould, order a winding up of a company under the just and equitable\nground. However, Toong’s position was that the present winding up\nproceedings were used for collateral purposes. 18     Toong\nsubmitted that the real reason for Tan bringing the winding up application\nwas to deny Litemax the fruits of its garnishee proceedings. He mentioned\nhow previous attempts by Tan to contest the Litemax Judgment had\nfailed. I have mentioned these attempts above. Toong also submitted that\ninstead of appealing against the AR’s decision of 8 January 2015\n(see[11]above),\nwhich counsel for Tan had said he would do, Tan had instead filed\nthe winding up application. I should mention that Tan’s counsel alleged\nthat what he said on 8 January 2015 was that he would take instructions\nabout an appeal. The new solicitors of Tan had only come into the\npicture recently. 19     In\nmy view, it is not uncommon or illegitimate for a shareholder or another\ncreditor or the debtor itself to try and deny a creditor the fruits\nof execution proceedings by filing winding up proceedings. Just\nas a creditor is entitled to take such steps as it thinks fit to\nobtain full payment, someone else is equally entitled to take such\nsteps as it thinks fit to thwart such a purpose (seeRe Projector SA[2009] 2 SLR(R) 151 at[23]–[25]). Therefore, the\nfiling of winding up proceedings to thwart a creditor from gaining\nan advantage is not in itself an abuse of the process of the court. 20     Furthermore,\nsince Tan was disputing the amount owing by the Company to Litemax,\nit made sense for an independent and neutral party like the liquidator\nto be appointed to look into Litemax’s claim. If the liquidator\nwas of the view that the amount claimed was valid, that would put\nan end to Tan’s dispute on the amount. If the liquidator took the opposite\nview, he would be entitled to take such steps as he thought fit\nto challenge the Litemax Judgment. Since Toong’s position was that\nTan’s dispute was unreasonable, Toong should welcome the appointment\nof the liquidator but for the fact that the order to wind up the\nCompany would thwart the garnishee proceedings. As stated above,\neach side is entitled to advance his own interest. 21     Toong\nalso had another reason to claim that the winding up application\nwas for a collateral purpose. He submitted that Tan was trying to\nrelieve himself from his obligations under the Closing Agreement\nby presenting the winding up application. This was to the detriment\nof the Company, its shareholders and its creditors (see para 35\nof Toong’s opposing affidavit of 29 January 2015). 22     However,\nToong did not elaborate in his opposing affidavit as to which aspect\nof Tan’s obligations under the Closing Agreement that he thought\nTan was trying to renege on. Toong’s counsel said that under clause 5\nof that agreement, it was agreed that one of the Company’s properties\nat Woodlands Link would be sold to Tan at a certain value and another\nat Woodlands Industrial Park E5 (“WIP E5”) to Litemax at another value.\nHowever, even if the stated values meant the intended sale prices, Toong’s\ncounsel was unable to say that the price for the intended sale of\nthe property at WIP E5 to Litemax was lower than the market value\nor that the intended sale of the property at Woodlands Link to Tan\nwas at a price higher than the market price, such that the Closing\nAgreement should still be performed. Indeed, no such assertion was\nmade in Toong’s affidavit. Neither did Toong assert in his affidavit\nthat Litemax had a special need or interest for the WIP E5 property\nsuch that Litemax should in any event have a right of first refusal\nfor that property. Therefore, the liquidator could still sell either\nproperty in the open market and Litemax or any other interested\nperson could attempt to purchase it. 23     Toong\nalso submitted that the Company needs to exist to complete existing\norders of its customers. He also alleged that the orders have not been\ncompleted and the Company needs to exist to collect payment from the\ncustomers (see para 25 of Toong’s submissions). 24     There\nwere two separate points to this submission. First, I asked whether\nany of the Company’s customers would take issue with the liquidation\nof the Company since orders received by the Company were already\nbeing performed by third parties like Pohlect and Litemax. Toong had\nnot identified any customer who would object. 25     Secondly,\nthe allegation that the Company needs to exist to collect payment\ndid not paint an accurate picture. The Company was not being dissolved.\nIt was being liquidated. The liquidator would take over the collection\nof payment. 26     It\nseemed to me that Toong himself had no good reason to oppose the winding\nup beyond the fact that Litemax’s garnishee proceedings would be thwarted. 27     In\nthe circumstances, I ordered the Company to be wound up with consequential\norders."
