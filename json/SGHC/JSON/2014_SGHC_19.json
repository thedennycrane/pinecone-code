        "The summary of the Statement\nof Facts": "",
        "The accused": "2       The\naccused is a 45-year-old male Singaporean and was a taxi driver. He\nis a divorcee staying at a rental flat at Block 33 Bendemeer Drive\n#01-751 (“the Rental Flat”). The deceased was his ex-lover.",
        "The deceased": "3       The\ndeceased was Mary Yoong Mei Ling, a 43-year-old female Singaporean.\nShe was also a divorcee and was in a relationship with Choo Lye\nWeng (“Steven”) at the time of her demise. Prior to her relationship with\nSteven, she was cohabitating with the accused. 4       At\nthe time of the offence, the deceased was staying with her cousin Phua\nDuan Kai (“the victim”) and his family. The victim is a 32-year-old male\nstaying at Block 206B Compassvale Lane #14-83 (“the Flat”).",
        "The relationship between the\naccused and the deceased": "5       The\naccused first met the deceased 17 years ago. At that time, they were\nmarried to their respective spouses. 6       Sometime\nin September 2008, the accused and the deceased, both divorced then,\nrenewed their friendship. They began a romantic relationship and\ncohabited at the Rental Flat. They referred to each other as “husband”\nand “wife” even though they were not legally married. 7       In\n2011, the accused and the deceased’s relationship began to deteriorate.\nThe accused became increasingly possessive and would become violent\nand break things when he was jealous. When they quarrelled, the deceased\nwould sometimes move out of the flat and stay with her friend, Justina\nCher Siow Wei (“Justina Cher”), at Block 207C Compassvale Lane. At\nother times, she would stay with her grandaunt, or her aunt to avoid\nthe accused. When they had reconciled, she would return to live\nwith the accused.",
        "End of the relationship": "8       Sometime\nin late 2011, the accused slapped the deceased when they were quarrelling.\nAfter this incident the deceased was resolved to end her relationship\nwith the accused. She moved out of the flat permanently. 9       The\ndeceased alternated between staying with Justina Cher, her grandaunt,\nand her aunt. The accused pleaded with the deceased to return to\nhim but she refused. The accused made numerous calls and sent several text\nmessages to the deceased’s mobile phone seeking reconciliation.\nShe did not respond. The accused also called Justina Cher and visited\nher flat to check on the deceased’s whereabouts. He approached common\nfriends and the deceased’s relatives to request for their assistance\nin persuading her to return to him. 10     The\naccused became more desperate in his attempts at reconciliation. His\nmessages became more threatening and he told the deceased on more than\none occasion that he would not leave her alone even if he became\na ghost.",
        "Threat to burn Justina Cher’s\nhome": "11     On\n16 February 2012, the accused sent a text message to the deceased threatening\nto set fire to Justina Cher’s home if the deceased refused to meet him.\nAs a result, the deceased agreed to meet him in the presence of\nhis brother. The accused and the deceased argued at this meeting.\nThe deceased chided the accused for resorting to empty threats.\nThe accused became angry and told the deceased that he was prepared\nto carry out his threat. He immediately drove his taxi to a petrol\nkiosk and purchased a four-litre tin of petrol. Thereafter, the\naccused returned to the meeting place where the deceased and the\naccused’s brother were still waiting. The accused showed the tin\nof petrol to the deceased to prove that the threat was real. The accused’s\nbrother advised him not to “act crazy”. The meeting ended and the\naccused brought the tin of petrol home. 12     Sometime\nin March 2012 the deceased and Justina Cher saw the accused in the\nvicinity of the latter’s flat. He was observing the flat from the multi-storey\ncar park. In the same month the deceased agreed to meet the accused\nat a karaoke lounge. Thereafter, the accused drove to a secluded location\nin Tuas. He wanted to commit suicide with the deceased by inhaling\nthe carbon monoxide in the car. The accused attempted to be intimate\nwith the deceased, but the latter resisted and alleged that the accused\nwas trying to rape her. In an attempt to stop him, she pretended\nto swallow the accused’s medication in his vehicle. The deceased\ncontinued to cry until the accused agreed to send her home. The\naccused then sent her to her grandaunt’s place. 13     After\nthis incident, the accused started abusing methamphetamine as he\nfelt depressed and hopeless. He wanted to use the drugs to torture himself.\nHe abused methamphetamine daily as he did not want to sleep. He hoped\nto seek sympathy from the deceased.",
        "Deceased’s relationship with\nSteven": "14     Sometime\nin March 2012, the deceased entered into a relationship with Steven.\nBetween April and May 2012, the deceased stayed with Steven in Johor\nBahru, Malaysia on several occasions. They soon decided to get married\nand started making preparations to register their marriage in Singapore\non 6 August 2012. They were also making arrangements to purchase\na flat. Throughout this time, the accused continued to call and send\ntext messages to the deceased, but she did not respond. On 22 May 2012\nthe deceased made a police report against the accused for harassment.",
        "Accused knelt before the deceased": "15     On\n23 May 2012, when the deceased was returning to the flat after an errand,\nshe met the accused who had been lying in wait for her. The deceased\ntried to run away but the accused chased her and caught her. The deceased\nwas very afraid and called the victim and another male friend to rescue\nher. The victim went down and saw the accused kneeling on the floor\nsobbing. He addressed the deceased as his “wife”. The deceased was standing\nwith her arms across her chest scolding him. Shortly after, the police\narrived at the scene. The accused was interviewed briefly before\nthe deceased and the accused were allowed to leave. 16     At\nthis point, it was clear to the accused that the deceased had no intention\nof reconciling with him. He resolved to kill the deceased by burning\nher and to commit suicide thereafter.",
        "The day before the offence": "17     The\naccused returned home after he was interviewed by the police on 23\nMay 2012. He proceeded to fill three empty plastic mineral water\nbottles with petrol from the four-litre tin of petrol he had purchased\nin February 2012 (see [11] above). He did so as he believed that\nit would be more convenient to carry out his plan of killing the\ndeceased by burning her if the petrol was stored in these mineral\nbottles rather than the bulky tin. He used transparent tape to seal\nthe caps of the plastic bottles to prevent spillage and to ensure\nthe smell of petrol could not be detected by others. He then placed the\nsaid bottles into a plastic bag. 18     Later\nthat night, the accused went to the deceased’s flat at Blk 206B Compassvale\nLane. He loitered around at the void deck and slept at the playground.\nSometime after 5.00 am on 24 May 2012, the accused woke up and kept\nwatch by observing the window of the Flat. At about 9.00 a.m., the accused\nwalked up the block and kept watch at the staircase beside the Flat. He\nwas hoping to see the deceased to talk to her. Shortly after, he\nsaw the deceased’s aunt returning to the Flat. As he did not manage\nto see the deceased, he left the place.",
        "Lay in wait for the deceased\non the day of the offence": "19     Later\nthat night, the accused poured petrol from the four-litre tin into three\nother plastic bottles. The accused kept the remaining petrol in\nthe four-litre tin in the kitchen behind a gas cylinder. He again\nsealed the three bottles with transparent tape and put them in the\nsame plastic bag that contained the three bottles he had filled\nup the previous day. The accused placed the said plastic bag into\na black “SMRT” carrier bag and took a taxi to Toa Payoh where he\nloitered around for a while. 20     At\nabout 9.25 p.m., the accused sent a text message to Tan Swee Fei (“Tan”),\none of his fellow taxi drivers. The accused informed him that he had\nmade arrangements to return Tan his money. The accused also requested\nTan to forward funds to his three daughters if he were to meet with\nany mishap. The accused ended the message by saying that he was going\nto do something big and that he hoped it would be successful. Tan asked\nhim what had happened but the accused did not respond. Tan thought\nthe accused was going to commit robbery. 21     On\n25 May 2012, sometime after 1.00 am, the accused arrived at the vicinity\nof the Flat. He placed the plastic bag containing the six plastic bottles\non the plant rack outside the Flat. The accused then proceeded to sleep\nat the staircase landing between the 14th and 15th floor. 22     At\nabout 3.00 a.m., the accused woke up and watched for movement outside\nthe Flat. At about 4.00 a.m., the deceased’s aunt opened the door.\nIt was part of her routine to go to the church to pray at that hour.\nWhen the accused heard the door opening, he noticed that the main\ngate was wide open. The accused peeped into the flat but could not\nsee anyone. The accused returned to the staircase landing between\nthe 14th and 15th floor and waited. Later, the deceased’s aunt left\nthe Flat. The accused continued to lie in wait for the deceased. 23     At\nabout 7.45 am, the accused again heard the sound of a door opening.\nThinking it was the deceased who had opened the door, the accused\nrushed to retrieve his plastic bag of mineral bottles filled with\npetrol which he placed on the plant rack. He intended to chase after\nthe deceased and to set her on fire by pouring petrol over her and\nigniting the petrol. However, it was a false alarm as it was a resident\nfrom another unit that was leaving for work. He returned to the\nstaircase landing with one plastic bottle containing petrol. 24     Shortly\nafterwards, the accused noticed the deceased’s uncle leaving the\nFlat for work. At this juncture, the accused knew that only the\ndeceased and the victim remained in the Flat. The accused continued\nwaiting at the staircase landing between the 14th and 15th floor.\nHe planned to pull the victim out of the Flat if he opened the door\nand gate and lock the deceased and himself in the flat thereafter.",
        "The attack on the deceased": "25     Sometime\nbefore 8.30 a.m., the deceased opened the door and the gate of the\nFlat. She was going to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority\nto collect her passport. The victim was still asleep in his room.\nWhen the accused heard the sound of the door opening, he rushed\ndown the staircase with the plastic bottle of petrol in his left\nhand and a lighter in his right hand. He held the lighter so that\nhe could use it to light the deceased up if she tried to run. 26     The\ndeceased was shocked when she saw the accused and asked him what\nhe wanted. The accused asked the deceased to give him one last chance\nto prove that he was capable of change and said that he would do whatever\nthe deceased wanted. The deceased reiterated that there was no possibility\nof reconciliation. The accused was very disappointed. He uncapped\nthe plastic bottle he was holding in his left hand. The deceased asked\nhim what he was doing. The accused replied that he wanted to take her\ntogether with him to die.",
        "The accused poured petrol over\nthe deceased and set her aflame": "27     As\nthe accused reach for more bottles of petrol from the plant rack, the\ndeceased tried to run inside the Flat. She managed to close and\nlocked the padlock to the gate. When the accused realised that he\nwould not be able to get inside the Flat, he reached out his right\narm through the grilles of the gate and grabbed the deceased. He\ndoused the deceased with petrol from the plastic bottle which he\nheld in his left hand. The deceased struggled to free herself and\nscreamed for the victim to save her. The victim was awakened by\nthe deceased’s screams and rushed out of his room. He saw the deceased\ntrying to close the door by leaning on it with her back and someone\nholding on to the deceased’s left arm. The victim saw the accused holding\non to the deceased and pouring a bottle of liquid over the deceased’s\nhead. The victim tried to close the door and pull the deceased away\nbut the accused managed to keep the door open. 28     At\nthis point, the accused felt his grip on the deceased loosening.\nHe quickly dropped the bottle on the floor and used the lighter\nto set the deceased on fire. The deceased caught fire immediately.\nThe accused then released his grip on her and let the door close.\nThe accused could hear the deceased and the victim screaming inside\nthe Flat. The accused’s right arm also caught fire in the process\nbut he managed to put it out. Unable to open another bottle of petrol,\nhe threw an unopened bottle of petrol on the floor, hoping that\nit would open. 29     In\nthe meantime, inside the Flat, the deceased was fully engulfed in flames.\nThe victim’s left arm and left leg also caught fire. The fire spread\nto the door and the ceiling. The victim used his waist-pouch that\nwas hanging near the door to beat the flames on the deceased’s body\nbut was unable to put it out. He pushed her towards the kitchen\nand shouted for her to go into the bathroom. The victim then rolled\non the floor in the living room and managed to put out the fire\non his body. He rushed into the kitchen and saw that the deceased\nhad managed to put out the fire on her body. Her whole body had\nblackened. 30     By\nthen, it was getting smoky and difficult to breathe in the Flat.\nThe victim tried calling for help using his mobile phone but was\nunable to make any calls. The victim then tried to put out the fire\nat the main door using two half-filled buckets of water that he\nfound in the master bedroom toilet and the kitchen toilet.",
        "Neighbours extinguished the\nfire": "31     At\nabout the same time, one of the neighbours staying on the 13th floor,\nNg Hock Bin (“Ng”), was on his way to work. He heard the sound of\na woman shouting and tiles cracking. He looked up and saw thick\nsmoke coming out from the Flat. He was concerned that someone might\nbe trapped in the Flat and shouted at his wife for a wet towel.\nHe took the wet towel and rushed upstairs. 32     Ng\nsaw the accused sitting on the floor, away from the fire. The entire door\nof the Flat was ablaze. As the accused had burn injuries on his\nhands and legs, Ng proceeded to wrap the wet towel around the accused’s\nhands. The accused was shouting that his wife was inside the flat. 33     In\nthe meantime, another neighbour, Kwek Ah Hock (“Kwek”), ran towards\nthe Flat with a pail of water. Ng and Kwek were trying to put out the\nfire with water. Eventually, they managed to put out the fire. They\nalso noticed two bottles of liquid on the floor near to the accused.\nThey suspected that it might be petrol. Ng moved the bottles away\nfrom the accused and the fire. 34     Ng\nnoticed that the gate was padlocked and that the door was closed. However\nhe managed to open the door. He saw that the flat was dark and filled\nwith smoke. The victim appeared at the doorway. He was seen to have burn\ninjuries on his hands and legs. Ng asked for the keys to the gate.\nThe victim returned shortly with the keys and Ng opened the gate.",
        "Accused rushed into the flat\nwhen it was opened": "35     The\naccused rushed into the flat to look for the deceased when the gate\nto the flat was opened. He approached the deceased. She told him\nnot to go near her and not to touch her. Later, the victim brought\nthe deceased out of the flat. She was badly burnt. The deceased’s\njeans were burnt, exposing her buttocks, and she was also almost\ntopless.",
        "Arrival of SCDF, police and\nambulance": "36     Soon\nSCDF officers and the police arrived separately at the scene. Upon\nquestioning by the police the accused admitted that he had started the\nfire. He told the police that the deceased wanted to leave him and\nhe had set the flat on fire because he wanted to die with the deceased. 37     Soon\nthe deceased was brought to the hospital by the ambulance. The accused\nand the victim were also conveyed to the hospital.",
        "Injuries sustained by the deceased": "38     The\ndeceased’s medical report indicated that she sustained 75 percent total\nbody surface area burns with inhalational injury. Her condition subsequently\ndeteriorated and she eventually succumbed to her injuries on the\nsame day, 25 May 2012, at about 10.56 pm.",
        "Victim’s injuries": "39     The\nvictim sustained 23 percent burns over his lower limb and bilateral\nfingers. The bronchoscopy showed soot in his airways. Further examination\nrevealed mid-to-deep dermal burns over the victim’s lower limbs\nup to his knees and the dorsum of the victim’s fingers on both hands. The\nvictim also had singed nasal hair and soot on his face. The victim\nwas intubated prophylactically in view of the inhalational injury,\nand sent to Burns Intensive Care Unit where he continued on fluid\nresuscitation. He then underwent burns excision and split skin graft\nsurgeries to his lower limbs. The victim recovered well after the\noperation and was discharged on 15 June 2012.",
        "Accused’s injuries": "40     The\naccused sustained deep dermal burns over his right arm and right leg.\nExcision and skin grafting were performed on 29 May 2012. His postoperative\nrecovery was uneventful and he was discharged on 6 June 2012. When\nhe was reviewed in clinic on 20 June 2012, all the accused’s wounds\nhad healed.",
        "The prosecution’s address on\nsentence": "41     The\nprosecution urged the court to impose an imprisonment term ranging\nfrom 16 to 20 years. The main reason is because there were many aggravating\nfactors in this case as revealed in the Statement of Facts. There was\nalso a high level of premeditation by the accused in planning the vicious\nattack on the deceased after the latter refused to reconcile with\nhim. The deceased sustained very severe burns and died soon afterwards.\nThe victim suffered 23% burns to his body. The accused also has\na latent propensity towards violent behaviour which, together with\nhis major depressive disorder, would pose serious danger to the\npublic and himself. According to Dr Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”), the\nconsultant psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health (“IMH”),\nthe accused requires indefinite psychiatric care and treatment as\nwell as close supervision and monitoring.",
        "The accused’s plea for lower\nterm of imprisonment": "42     The\ncounsel for the accused pleaded for an imprisonment term in the region\nof 10 years. The emphasis of the mitigation plea was on the accused’s major\ndepressive disorder at the time of the commission of the offence.\nThe accused was first diagnosed in December of 2011 by IMH to be\nsuffering from major depressive disorder but he did not follow up\nwith the treatment as he opined that the deceased did not care about\nhim. It was submitted that the accused’s condition can be cured\nwith medical rehabilitation. His family will also provide a support\nstructure upon his release from prison to ensure that there is no\nrelapse of his medical condition. The counsel pleaded that the accused\nis very remorseful and deeply regrets his actions. He also pleaded\nthat the accused also had no intention to injure the victim.",
        "The court’s decision": "43     The\naccused in this case torched a living human being immediately after\ndousing her with flammable petrol. When she was set ablaze, she screamed\nas a result of the excruciating pain from the burns. 75 percent\nof her body surface area had severe burns. Most of the burns were\nof full thickness. She eventually succumbed to her injuries and\ndied on the same day of the attack. This was a horrific attack on\nthe deceased. When she was adamant in not returning to the accused,\nhe decided to kill her and then commit suicide. The accused clearly\nhad the motive and intention to kill the deceased. This would have\nbeen a clear case of murder if it had not been for his major depressive\ndisorder diagnosed by Dr Goh.",
        "What is the sentencing principle\nfor this case?": "44     What\nis the appropriate sentencing principle to apply when the accused\nfaces the charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder when\nhe is diagnosed with major depressive disorder? The prosecution submitted\nthat deterrence is of “penumbral significance”. The defence, on the\nother hand, advocated rehabilitation. It is thus clear that both\nthe prosecution and the defence have given due weight to the accused’s\nmajor depressive disorder in their respective submissions by appreciating\nthe diminished primacy of deterrence in this case. What then is\nthe degree of importance or focus this court should accord to the\naccused’s mental disorder which had clinically impaired his judgment\nwhen he killed the deceased? The question will involve the balancing\nof the public interest in protecting society and the interest of\nthe accused. Should the societal needs and concerns be subordinated\nto the accused’s mental disorder? This must depend on the gravity\nof the offence and the circumstances of the case. I am of the view\nthat the public interest must prevail over that of the accused in this\ncase. 45     There\nare four sentencing principles as mentioned by Lawton LJ inR v Sargeant(1974) 60 Cr App R 74 (“R v Sargeant”). He said at 77: What ought the proper penalty be? … [The]\nclassical principles [of sentencing] are summed up in four words:\nretribution, deterrence, prevention and rehabilitation. Any judge\nwho comes to sentence ought always to have those four classical\nprinciples in mind and to apply them to the facts of the case to\nsee which of them has the greatest importance in the case with which\nhe is dealing. The defence counsel in advocating for rehabilitation principle\nreferred me toPublic Prosecutor v Lim Ah Seng[2007]\n2 SLR(R) 957 in which Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) restated\nthe approach in sentencing accused persons who have mental disorder\nat [49]: … Where a person suffers from a mental\nimpairment such that his actions are not the result of conscious\ndeliberation, deterrence, both general and specific, is not the\npredominant sentencing consideration. This is only common sense\nbecause deterrence operates on the assumption of human autonomy.\nInNg So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 178 at [58], Yong Pung How CJ held, citingR\nv Wiskich[2000] SASC 64 in support: … I found that … the element of general\ndeterrence can and should be given considerably less weight if the\noffender was suffering from a mental disorder at the time of the\ncommission of the offence. This is particularly so if there is a\ncausal link between the mental disorder and the commission of the\noffence. … In my view, general deterrence will not be enhanced by\nmeting out an imprisonment term to a patient suffering from a serious\nmental disorder which led to the commission of the offence. 46     This\nwas reiterated inGoh Lee Yin v Public Prosecutor[2006]\n1 SLR(R) 530, where Yong Pung How CJ also remarked at [29]: The rehabilitation of the offender could\nalso take precedence where other sentencing considerations such\nas deterrence are rendered less effective, as might be the case\nfor an offender belabouring under a serious psychiatric condition\nor mental disorder at the time of the incident … 47     I\ndo not dispute that the rehabilitation of the accused is important\nbut it should not be the sole and principal consideration in this\ncase. InPublic Prosecutor v Goh Lee Yinand another appeal[2008] 1 SLR(R) 824\n(“Goh Lee Yin”), V K Rajah JA stated\nat [107]: … Indeed, assuming that an offender suffers\nfrom a psychiatric disease which causes him to commit a particular\nheinous offence, it would surely not be correct to say that such\nan offender ought to be rehabilitated to the exclusion of other\npublic interests. Rehabilitation may still be a relevant consideration, but\nsuch rehabilitation may very well have to take place in an environment where\nthe offender is prevented from recommitting similar offences. 48     I\nwould also like to refer to theSentencing\nPractice in the Subordinate Courtsvol 1 (LexisNexis,\n3rd Ed, 2013) at pp 152–153: Mental\nCondition The existence of a mental disorder is always a relevant factor\nin the sentencing process, but its impact will vary considerably\naccording to the circumstances of the individual case. The following approach inR\nv Wiskich[2000] SASC 64 has been endorsed; seeNg So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 178: An assessment of the disorder is required.\nA sentencing court must determine the impact of the disorder upon\nthe offender’s thought processes and the capacity of the offender\nto appreciate the gravity and significance of the criminal conduct\n… [A]s a general proposition, if an offender acts with knowledge\nof what is being done and with knowledge of the gravity of the criminal\nconduct, the importance of the element of general deterrence otherwise\nappropriate in the particular circumstances is not greatly affected.\nThe gravity of the criminal conduct is also an important consideration.\nIt is not difficult to understand that the element of general deterrence\ncan readily be given considerably less weight in the case of an\noffender suffering from a significant mental disorder who commits\na minor crime, particularly if a causal relationship exists between\nthe mental disorder and the commission of such an offence. In some\ncircumstances, however, the mental disorder may not be serious or\ncausally related to the commission of the crime, and the circumstances\nof the crime so grave, that very little weight in mitigation can\nbe given to the existence of the mental disorder and full weight\nmust be afforded to the element of general deterrence. In between\nthose extremes, an infinite variety of circumstances will arise\nin which competing considerations must be balanced. The element of general deterrence can and\nshould be given considerably less weight if the offender was suffering\nfrom a mental disorder at the time of the commission of the offence.\nThis is particularly so if there is a causal link between the mental\ndisorder and the commission of the offence. In addition to the need\nfor a causal link, other factors such as the seriousness of the mental\ncondition, the likelihood of the appellant repeating the offence\nand the severity of the crime, are factors which have to be taken\ninto account by the sentencing judge. General deterrence will not\nbe enhanced by meting out an imprisonment term to a patient suffering\nfrom a serious mental disorder which led to the commission of the\noffence; seeNg So Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 178.",
        "Retribution": "49     Therefore\nI agree that “general deterrence can and should be given considerably\nless weight if the offender was suffering from a mental disorder\nat the time of the commission of the offence”:Ng\nSo Kuen Connie v Public Prosecutor[2003] 3 SLR(R) 178\nat [58]. How much weight to be given to the element of deterrence\nwill have to depend on the degree and intensity of the mental disorder\nthat affect the offender’s judgment and decision making ability\nas well as the circumstance in which the offence is committed. There\nare various types of mental disorders. Such disorder affects a person’s\nmental faculty differently depending on the degree of the intensity\nof the disorder. The impact of the mental disorder on the offender at\nthe time of the commission of the offence will have an effect on\nhis culpability. For instance, inPublic Prosecutor\nv Han John Han[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1180 (“Han\nJohn Han”), the accused was suffering from delusional disorder\nof the persecutory type at the time of the offence. He believed\nthat his wife was having an affair and that she intended to kill\nhim using black magic. This caused him to plunge a sword into his\nwife killing her and an unborn child. In this sort of situation\nthe offender’s criminal act was clearly dominated by his mental\ndisorder and he had very little or no influence over his autonomy\nof judgment and decision making capability. Hence the element of\ndeterrence should only have penumbral significance. The facts of\nthis instant case are materially different from the accused inHan John Han. The events preceding the\nfatal torching of the deceased and the fateful day of the offence\nclearly revealed a revengeful and scornful lover who had a premeditated\nplan and who was determined to kill the deceased almost at all cost.\nIf it had not been for Dr Goh’s diagnosis that the accused was suffering\nfrom a clinical major depressive disorder his actions and behaviour\nbefore and during the commission of the offence would appear to\nbe those of a rational person who was resolute to kill the deceased.\nBe that as it may, I am of the view that the primary operative sentencing principle\nin this case should be retribution and not deterrence. This principle\nrequires the accused to be punished for his crime. The concept of just\ndesert and the principle of proportionality are important elements\nin retributive principle of sentencing. Lawton LJ inR v Sargeantat 77said: … The Old Testament concept of an eye for\nan eye and tooth for tooth no longer plays any part in our criminal\nlaw. There is, however, another aspect of retribution which is frequently\noverlooked: it is that society, through the courts, must show its\nabhorrence of particular types of crime, and the only way in which\nthe courts can show this is by the sentences they pass. The courts\ndo not have to reflect public opinion. On the other hand courts\nmust not disregard it. Perhaps the main duty of the court is to\nlead public opinion. … InR v Davies(1978) 67 Cr\nApp R 207, the court at 210 stated: [T]he courts have to make it clear that\ncrime does not pay and the only way they can do so is by the length\nof sentences. Sentences show the court’s disapproval, on behalf\nof the community, of particular types of criminal conduct. … Similarly,Halsbury’s Laws of Englandvol\n11(2) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 2003) describes the retributive\nelement at para 1188: The retributive element is intended to\nshow public revulsion from the offence and to punish the offender\nfor his wrong conduct. 50     The\nfoundation of retribution which requires the offender to pay for his\ncrime is also a matter of public interest such that confidence in\nthe administration of justice is maintained. This comes from the\nbelief that the offender has upset societal law and order and the\nappropriate punishment restores the order of society. It is to quell\n“the sense of outrage felt by the community” for particular criminal\nacts:Public Prosecutor v Tan Fook Sum[1999]\n1 SLR(R) 1022 (“Tan Fook Sum”) at\n[20]. As noted by the Court of Appeal inPublic\nProsecutor v AFR[2011] 3 SLR 833, a case which also\ndealt with culpable homicide not amounting to murder, at [32]: … In the circumstances, the demands of\nretributive justice mandate that a heavy sentence must be imposed\non the respondent to ensure that his punishment is proportionate\nto his culpability as reflected by the viciousness which he inflicted\nviolence on the [victim]. As opined by Andrew von Hirsch and Andrew\nAshworth in Proportionate Sentencing: Exploring the Principles (Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2005) at p 4: Proportionalist sentencing is designed\nto avoid unjust results – through giving conceptions of justice\na central role in sentencing policy. The desert rationale rests\non the idea that the penal sanction should fairly, reflect the degree\nof reprehensibleness (that is, the harmfulness and culpability)\nof the actor’s conduct. This comports with common-sense notions\nof justice, that how severely a person is punished should depend\non the degree of blameworthiness of his conduct. … In desert theory,\nthe societal interest is expressed in the recognition that typical\ncrimes (eg, those of force …) are wrongs, for which public censure\nthrough criminal sanction is due. [original emphasis omitted] 51     In\nthat case, the accused had viciously beaten his daughter to death. The\nCourt of Appeal noticed the viciousness of the attack and sentenced\nthe accused to 10 years’ imprisonment (the maximum imprisonment\nfor the case as the charge was under s 304(b) of the Penal Code\n(Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) and 10 strokes of the cane. Therefore, the\njust desert for the accused requires this court to examine the aggravating\nfactors, the harm caused, criminality of the accused and his mitigation.\nThis will enable this court to arrive at an appropriate punishment\nthat is proportionate to the accused’s criminal conduct. I shall\nexamine the aggravating factors, mitigating factors and the accused’s\nmental condition.",
        "Aggravating factors": "",
        "Motive to kill and premeditation": "52     The\nmotive to kill the deceased was formed when the accused failed at all\nhis attempts to win her back. He first used the soft approach of persuasion.\nHe tried to call and send text messages urging her to return to him.\nHe also tried to locate the deceased’s place of abode. When all\nthese failed he changed strategy. He used intimidation and threats.\nHe told her that he would not leave her alone even if he became\na ghost. 53     He\nhad to threaten to burn Justina Cher’s home before he could meet up\nwith her. When the deceased rebuked him for the empty threat he immediately\nwent to purchase four litres of petrol to prove that the threat was\nreal. The accused’s brother stopped him and told him not to “act\ncrazy” which dissuaded him from proceeding with his threat. The\naccused’s behaviour at this stage was very much that of a rational\nperson. 54     When\nhe drove the deceased to Tuas he had thought of killing her and himself\nby inhaling carbon monoxide from his car as he realised that he could\nnot win her back. When the accused tried to be intimate with the deceased,\nshe spurned his advances and cried to go home. The accused relented\nand sent her home. 55     On\n23 May 2012, two days before the offence, he was lying in wait for the\naccused. She was staying with her cousin’s family at the Flat. When\nthe deceased saw him she started to run away and the accused chased\nher. She shouted for her cousin to save her. The accused knelt down\nand sobbed. The deceased was scolding him. The police soon arrived\nand the accused left. This incident was a clear indication to the\naccused that the deceased had no intention at reconciliation. He\nthen planned to burn her to death with the petrol that he had bought\nearlier and then take his own life. 56     He\nwent back to his flat and filled three empty mineral water bottles from\nthe four-litre tin of petrol as it was more convenient, easier and\nfaster to douse the deceased with the petrol. He also sealed the\ncaps of the mineral bottles so as to prevent spillage and to ensure\nthat people would not detect that he was carrying petrol. He brought\nthese bottles of petrol and waited for the deceased outside her\nflat in the early morning of 24 May 2012. When he did not manage\nto see her, he returned home. These indicate that the accused was\nin full control of his faculty and wanted revenge. 57     He\nfilled another three mineral bottles with petrol and returned to\nthe vicinity of the deceased’s flat to lie in wait for her. This\nwas during the night of the same day, 24 May 2012. The next morning\nhe saw the deceased leaving the flat and attacked her with the petrol\nhe brought. 58     From\nthe above it is clear that the events two days before the fatal incident\nrevealed the accused’s motive and his meticulous plan to burn the deceased\nwith the petrol he had purchased earlier. There was a strong element\nof premeditation by the accused. It was a well calculated attack\non the deceased in which the accused patiently waited for several\nhours before he seized the opportunity to cause the most harm to\nher. It is well established that an offender who plans his crime\nis more culpable, as stated by Yong Pung How CJ inTan\nFook Sumat [28]: … It is well established that where an\nact is done after deliberation and with premeditation as opposed\nto the situation where it is done on the spur of the moment and\n“in hot blood”, that is an aggravating and not a mitigating circumstance. 59     Professor\nAndrew Ashworth also noted inSentencing and\nCriminal Justice(Cambridge University Press, 5th Ed,\n2010) at p 164: Planning\nof an offence Elements of planning or organisation may also be present in\ncrimes committed by individuals. A person whoplans\na crime is generally more culpable, because the offence\nis premeditated and the offender is therefore more fully confirmed\nin his criminal motivation than someone who acts on impulse, since\nhe is more considered in his lawbreaking. … Planned lawbreaking\nbetokens a considered attack on social values, with greater commitment\nand perhaps continuity than a spontaneous crime. [emphasis added]",
        "Accused appeared normal to family\nand friends": "60     This\nis not a case in which the accused suddenly snapped because of his\nmental condition. This also does not appear to be a case in which\nthe major depressive disorder had dispossessed him of his self-control.\nAnyone looking at the facts of this case will not come to the conclusion\nthat the accused was suffering from a major depressive disorder.\nHis friends and family members, according to Dr Goh, did not observe\nhim to manifest any psychotic behaviour. He was only diagnosed to\nbe suffering from major depressive disorder when he was sent to\nIMH for an assessment after his arrest. What the accused had done\nhere was methodological and meticulous. He had prepared his murder\ntool, the petrol, by filling it up in plastic bottles which made\nit convenient for him to douse the deceased with the petrol. He\ntaped the caps of the plastic bottles so as to prevent anybody from\ndetecting the petrol which he intended to use to kill the deceased.\nHe lay in wait for an opportune moment to ambush the deceased. He\nalso carried with him a lighter just in case the deceased were to\nattempt to run away, proving that he had considered contingencies\nas well. The entire plan to kill the victim was devised in a cold,\nconscientious manner over a span of two days. Also, the accused\nwas in no hurry to kill the deceased. He was patient and had no\nqualms about waiting until the next day when no opportune moment\narose when he first lay in wait for the deceased. Instead of giving\nup, he was persistent in carrying out his plan. There was nothing to\nsuggest that the accused’s major depressive disorder made him unable\nto fully appreciate the consequences of his actions. Therefore,\nthe accused deserves a harsher sentence than an offender who had\ncommitted the offence on impulse arising from a severe mental disorder.",
        "Harm and damage caused by the\naccused": "61     This\nwas, indeed, a very cruel and vicious attack on a person whom he once\nloved. When he was unable to win her love he became malicious and vindictive\nas he sought to kill her since he could not have her. He was not prepared\nto let her go and let her lead her own life. This was a very vengeful, selfish\nand ruthless act. Further, the accused paid no regard to the possible harm\nwhich could have been caused to others. He was so driven to kill\nthe deceased that he did not care if other people would have been\nhurt in the process. The deceased’s injuries 62     The\ndeceased was set ablaze. She screamed because of the excruciating pain.\nHer body sustained 75% burns. Most of the burns were of full thickness.\nShe also sustained inhalational injury as the flames also entered her\nbody through her nostrils. She succumbed to these injuries on the\nsame day. The photographs of her injuries show how much she suffered\nbefore she died. Nobody deserves such a gruesome fate. The victim’s injuries 63     The\naccused was so focused on killing the deceased that he did not pay\nheed to the consequences of his action. The victim who came to the deceased’s\nrescue was also badly injured. He too screamed in pain. His body sustained\n23% burn. He had mid and deep burns over his lower limbs and hands.\nHe also suffered inhalational injuries. He underwent burns excision and\nsplit skin graft surgeries to his lower limbs. He was only discharged after\n3 weeks. Fortunately, he did not die from the burns. Neighbourhood at great risk\nof runaway fire 64     The\nfire had put the neighbourhood, especially the adjacent flats, at great\nrisk. The fire had a real probability of going out of control. Fortunately,\nthe fire was put out through the civic actions of the neighbours.\nOtherwise the consequences could have been direr with more people\ninjured and loss of properties.",
        "Accused’s latent violent temperament\nand criminal antecedents": "65     Dr\nGoh’s psychiatric report dated 5 July 2012 revealed that the accused\nhad a violent nature at a very young age. He fought when he was\nin primary school for which he was caned twice. He has a quick temper\nand is easily irritable. He was also involved in secret society\nand was the Chief of the “24” or “Xiao Lao Jun” gang in the Toa\nPayoh area. He was previously arrested and incarcerated for gang\nrelated activities such as being involved in gang fights. He also\ntold Dr Goh that he had difficulty controlling his temper and had\nquarrelled with other drivers while on the road. He also had quarrels\nwith others including his fellow taxi drivers. His conflicts and quarrels\nwith the deceased, and his subsequent hitting of the deceased, was what\ncaused the deceased to leave him. When the accused quarrelled with the\ndeceased he would overturn tables, chairs and break things. He fought with\nhis eldest brother in 2007 and fought with his second brother in\n2010. This may explain why he had problems with his family, his\ncolleagues and the deceased. 66     Therefore\nthe accused has a violent disposition and to make it worse he has\nan uncontrollable temper and is impulsive. When he could not persuade\nthe deceased to return to him his violent nature quickly took over him.\nHe resorted to threat and intimidation and eventually killed the deceased\nin the most gruesome and painful manner. 67     The\naccused’s criminality is worsened by his history of substance abuse\nand drug consumption. He told Dr Goh that he sniffed glue when he was\nsixteen years old. He also took ketamine, “ice” and marijuana. 68     The\naccused also has a criminal record. He was detained for offences under\nthe Criminal Law (Temporary Provisions) Act (“CLTPA”) (Cap 67, 2000\nRev Ed) and its previous editions on various occasions: (a)     15/12/1986\n– The accused was placed on 3 years police supervision under the\nCLTPA 1970 (Cap 112, 1970 Rev Ed). (b)     31/3/1989\n– A detention order was issued against the accused under the CLTPA\n(Cap 67, 1985 Rev Ed). A police supervision order was also issued\nfor 36 months. This was revoked after a review on 29 November 1995. (c)     12/12/1998\n– Another detention order was issued against the accused under the\nCLPTA (Cap 67, 1998 Rev Ed). There was also a 36 months police supervision\norder. (d)     20/7/2004\n– The accused was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment for failing\nto remain indoors while he was under the police supervision order\nunder the CLTPA (Cap 67, 2000 Rev Ed). He was also sentenced to\n3 months’ imprisonment for failing to report to the Head Investigation\nof the Police Division. These sentences were ordered to run concurrently. 69     The\nfact that his antecedents were under CLTPA means that he was involved\nin secret society activities which are often associated with violent activities.\nHe had informed Dr Goh that he was the Chief of the “24” or “Xiao\nLao Jun” gang and that he was involved in gang fights. Therefore,\nI disagree with his counsel that the accused’s antecedents did not\nspecifically disclose violent offences. It seems that his infringements\nof the CLTPA for his secret society activities were from 1986 to\n2004, ie about 18 years. To his credit he did not have any antecedent\nfor the last 10 years. 70     Hence,\nthe society has to be protected from the accused who is quick tempered,\nimpulsive and has a latent violent disposition. Prevention is one of\nthe principal considerations when sentencing offenders who pose\na danger to the community. This is embodied by the maxim “salus populi est suprema lex”, ie the\nsafety of the people is the supreme law:Chan\nHiang Leng Colin and others v Public Prosecutor[1994]\n3 SLR(R) 209 at [40]. 71     Dr\nGoh had further opined that the accused’s major depressive disorder\n“had further increased his risk of severe violence” in his report dated\n5 July 2012. Although he did not have any antecedents for the last\n10 years, his violent streak and vicious attack on the deceased\nwithout any regard for the safety of others is very worrying.",
        "Mitigating Factors": "72     The\naccused had chosen to plead guilty. This is a mitigating factor\nas it indicates that he was contrite and remorseful. The court was\nalso informed that he had found a religion when he was in remand.\nI am aware that the accused also suffered serious injuries arising\nfrom this incident. These injuries were entirely of his own doing.\nThe most relevant mitigating factor is that he was suffering from\na major depressive disorder that significantly impaired his judgment.",
        "Accused’s psychiatric condition": "73     In\nsentencing the accused I am also aware of Dr Goh’s observations\nof the accused when he was in remand. In his report dated 4 April\n2013, Dr Goh said: … [T]he accused would require psychiatric\ncare and treatment for an indefinite period of time and close supervision\nand monitoring of his psychiatric treatment, in order to manage\nthe above risk factors [as well as] to mitigate his violence andself-harm\nrisks. A poorly managed psychiatric condition and resumption of\nhis substance misuse would adversely impact his behavioural, social\nand psychological functioning and would very likely further impair\nhis impulse control, which would be very destabilizing for him. The supervision and monitoring of his psychiatric\ncondition to manage such risks could be carried out in a correctional\nsetting. … 74     In\nthe latest psychiatric report dated 4 December 2013, Dr Goh said that\nwhile the accused’s condition has improved, it was due to the enforced care\nthat was administered whilst he was in custody. Dr Goh was concerned about\nthe accused’s motivation “to persist with such psychiatric treatment in\na less structured environment such as living in the community”.\nHe further added: [The accused’s]insight\ninto his need for treatment for his depression and the role of medications\nappear limited.He told me he had intended not to take medications\nbut was persuaded by his counsel to continue doing so until his doctor\nassessed him to no longer require medication(s). He appeared ambivalent\nwhen I canvassed his views about long-term psychiatric follow-up\nand treatment. He said that “if he felt very well, should have no\nneed to go back to IMH”. … I note his motivation for psychiatric treatment\nwas also low prior to the offence. He discontinued his outpatient\npsychiatric follow-up after only one review at IMH (on 28thDecember\n2011), after this visit did not elicit any expression of concern\nfrom the deceased. … He appeared over-confident that his depressive\ndisorder would not recur and that he would not resume his substance\nmisuse in the community, citing his religious beliefs. In a controlled\nenvironment like the prisons, cloistered from stressors he had faced\nin the community, he could receive close monitoring and supervision\nwith regards to his psychiatric condition and early detection of\nany recurrence of depressive symptom is possible. However treatment discontinuance, with\nits attendant risks, would be akey concernin\na less structured environment, such as living in the community on his\nown, as is his preference. The ability of his family to provide\ntangible support in the community, as well as any limitations they\nmight face, also has to be considered in ensuring that he remains\nwell in the community. [emphasis added] 75     Dr\nGoh is of the view that the accused requires psychiatric care and treatment\nfor an indefinite period of time in a correctional setting. He cautioned\nthat the accused’s condition would inevitably relapse should he leave\nthe correctional environment. For obvious reason, the accused wanted\nhis treatment to be conducted outside the prison environment.",
        "Family Support upon release\nfrom prison": "76     The\ncounsel for the accused has presented additional affidavits from the\naccused’s three daughters. The accused’s eldest daughter who is\nhelping her mother at her coffee shop at Toa Payoh Lorong 6 assured\nthe court that she and the other two daughters will ensure that\nthe accused continues his treatment upon his release from prison.\nThe daughters have agreed that the accused will stay with the second\ndaughter who is a housewife working as a freelance manicurist. The\neldest daughter is also happy for her father to reside with her.\nThis family support is heartening and will go a long way to help\nthe accused to be cured of his mental disorder upon his release\nfrom prison. I hope the accused will use his time in prison to bond\nwith his daughters so that upon his discharge he will have strong\nfamilial support to help him to be cured of the mental disorder\npermanently.",
        "The charge": "77     The\ncharge against the accused is under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. The\nstatutory prescribed punishment is life imprisonment and is also\nliable to caning or imprisonment for a term which may extend to\n20 years and is also liable for caning or fine. I am mindful that\ns 304(a) was amended in 2007. As a result of the amendment the maximum\nterm of imprisonment has been increased from 10 years to 20 years.\nThe rest of provision remains unchanged. The enhancement of the\nstatutory prescribed punishment does not mean that the punishment\nmust be accordingly increased. At the Second Reading of the Penal\nCode (Amendment) Bill, Member of Parliament Christopher de Souza,\nexplained the reason for the increase (Singapore\nParliamentary Debates, Official Report(22 October 2007)\nvol 51 at cols 2216–2217 (Christopher de Souza, Member of Parliament): [T]he revised section 304(a) is a sentencing\nprovision and it allows the Court to sentence an offender who was\nconvicted for culpable homicide not amounting to murder to either\n(i) up to 20 years’ imprisonment or (ii) life. This is an immense\nimprovement over the old section 304(a) which allowed judges the\ndiscretion to sentence an offender up to 10 years or life, but nothing\nin between. What made the old position even more ineffective was the\nwide gap between life imprisonment (interpreted as the remainder\nof the offender’s natural life) and the relatively short alternative\nof “up to 10 years”. The amendment has remedied this.It gives the Court flexibility when sentencing offenders,\nespecially those who need to be imprisoned for a length of time\nbetween 10 and 20 years. [emphasis added]",
        "The principle of proportionality": "78     The\nappropriate sentence must take into account all the circumstances,\nthe aggravating features, the mitigating factors as well as the criminality\nof the accused. The sentence must befit the crime and the accused.\nApplying the principle of proportionality, what is the just desert for\nthe accused? Both the prosecution and the defence cited past sentencing precedents\nto assist the court to arrive at the appropriate sentence. The sentences\nin those cases vary widely depending on the merits of each case. 79     I\nhave earlier mentioned that in my view the correct sentencing principle\nis retribution and not rehabilitation (see [49] above). If the sole purpose\nfor his incarceration is for his rehabilitation then, perhaps, a\nterm of 10 years’ imprisonment may be sufficient as the focus is\non the rehabilitation of the accused. However, when applying the\nretributive principle the focus is on the appropriate punishment\nof the accused for his heinous crime applying the principle of proportionality.\nAs noted by Abadee J inR v Fernando(1997)\n95 A Crim R 533 at 544–545: There are some cases where the level of\nculpability is so extreme that the community interest in retribution\nand punishment can only be met through the imposition of the maximum\npenalty: seeGarforth. Next, rehabilitation and\nthe prospect of offering a person some hope from incarceration,\nwhilst being important considerations and are to be taken into account\nin favour of persons in the position of each of the prisoners, nevertheless\nthe requirement of retributive judgments involving the objective\nfeatures of an instant case may amply warrant not only a case being\nregarded as in the worst category of cases but as warranting the\nimposition of the maximum penalty: seeBakerandGarforth. Indeed, as the decision of Hunt\nCJ inMilatillustrates there may\nbe some cases falling within the category of the worst class of\ncases, where there is even little utility in considering the prospects\nof rehabilitation. Indeed, it may be that in such cases the subjective\ncircumstances generally of a prisoner himself cannot play any real\ndecisive part. 80     The\nmaximum sentence in this case is life imprisonment. I am of the view\nthat life imprisonment may not be appropriate. However, in my view this\nis one of the worst cases of culpable homicide not amounting to\nmurder because of the very aggravating features. Therefore, the\ncommunity interest in retribution can only be met through a very\nsubstantial sentence notwithstanding the accused’s mental condition. 81     I\nhave also noted that there is a need to consider the principle of prevention\ngiven the violent disposition of the accused (see [70] above). As noted\nby V K Rajah JA inGoh Lee Yinat\n[108]: … [I]n cases involving serious offense,\nincapacitation would usually form the focus of the sentencing process.\n… It is popularly referred to as “public protection” and advocates\nthe imposition of long, incapacitative custodial sentences on “dangerous”\noffenders when the potential risk to prospective victims is substantial.\n… [S]uch a consideration would be highly relevant in cases involving\nserious offencesnotwithstanding the fact that\nthe offender suffers from an impulse control psychiatric disorder,\nwhich causes the commission of the very offence. … [emphasis\nadded] 82     Given\nthat an impulse control psychiatric disorder would not prevent the\napplication of the prevention principle by the Court in reaching\na long, incapacitative custodial sentence,a\nfortiori, the accused’s major depressive disorder which\ndoes not appear on the facts to have caused the accused to act impulsively\nshould not deter such an application as well.",
        "Conclusion": "83     Therefore,\nconsidering the heinousness of the accused’s killing of the deceased\nand the need to prevent further acts of violence a very long sentence\nof imprisonment is warranted despite the accused’s major depressive\ndisorder. The level of heinousness of this crime and the need for society\nto be protected give rise to the consequence that the subjective circumstance\nof the accused cannot displace the need for a long incapacitative\nsentence:R v Harris(2000) 50 NSWLR\n409 at [102]. Accordingly, I sentenced the accused to 20 years’\nimprisonment. The sentence will take effect from the date of remand\nie 26 May 2012."
