        "Introduction": "1       This\nis an appeal by the Plaintiff from the decision of the learned Assistant\nRegistrar Teo Guan Kee (“the AR”) in Summons No 3506 of 2013 (“Sum\n3506”) delivered on 28 August 2013, granting the Defendant conditional\nleave to defend Suit No 352 of 2013 (“the Second Suit”) under O\n14 r 4 of the Rules of Court (Cap 233, R 5, 2004 Rev Ed) (“ROC”).\nThe subject matter of the Second Suit relates back to an earlier\naction between the same parties which was supposed to have been\n“resolved” by means of a Settlement Agreement dated 1 February 2013\n(“the Settlement Agreement”). 2       The\nappeal involves an interesting legal issue which is whether, and\nif so to what degree, the alleged illegality in an action would\ntaint a settlement agreement arising out of that action. 3       After\nhearing the parties, I am allowing the appeal and reversing the decision\nof the AR granting conditional leave to defend. Summary judgment\nis, therefore, entered in favour of the Plaintiff.",
        "The Facts": "",
        "The parties": "4       The\nPlaintiff and Defendant were business associates in a public company\nin Singapore, Firstlink Investments Corporation Limited (“Firstlink”).\nThe Plaintiff, Ling Yew Kong, is the Executive Chairman of Firstlink\n(“the Plaintiff”), and the Defendant, Teo Vin Li Richard (the “Defendant”),\ngot to know the Plaintiff through various business dealings. 5       The\nPlaintiff is the appellant in the appeal before me while the Defendant\nis the respondent. I refer to parties in their original capacity\nas in the hearing below.",
        "Suit No 733 of 2012 – the First\nSuit": "6       Suit\nNo 733 of 2012 was started in the High Court of Singapore on 4 September\n2012 (“the First Suit”). The First Suit embodied a claim by the plaintiff\nagainst the defendant for $730,000 alleged to be owed by the Defendant\ntogether with interests and costs. According to the Plaintiff’s Statement\nof Claim in the First Suit dated 4 September 2012, the money was loaned\nto the Defendant to enable the Defendant to pay a debt that he owed to\none Foo Chek Hin (“Foo”). Payment was made by the Plaintiff by means of\na cheque dated 6 January 2012 drawn to the order of Foo. The Plaintiff’s claim\nwas that Defendant had agreed to repay the monies, but eventually failed\nto do so. In support of the claim, the Plaintiff pleaded a signed Acknowledgement\ndated 5 January 2012 (hereinafter referred to as “the Acknowledgment\nof Debt”). The Plaintiff in further support also asserted that the\nDefendant had attempted to make a part payment of the debt on or around\n17 February 2012 by means of a cheque of $100,000 drawn to the order\nof the Plaintiff, and was therefore a further acknowledgment of\nthe debt. The cheque was subsequently dishonoured when presented\nfor payment. 7       The\ndefence filed in the First Suit dated 2 October 2012 denied the claim.\nThe defence was that the Plaintiff and Defendant had discussed a number\nof commercial projects in early 2011 and through the discussions the\nDefendant came to trust and have confidence in the Plaintiff, treating the\nPlaintiff as a “mentor and a good friend”. The Defendant asserted\nthat the Plaintiff frequently entertained businessmen at the integrated\nresorts in Singapore, and that sometime in April 2011 the Plaintiff\nand Defendant agreed that the Plaintiff would “act as a junket”\nby offering credit in the form of non-negotiable chips to businessmen\nand friends of the Plaintiff and the Defendant. The Defendant asserted\nthat by doing this the Plaintiff would earn a “rolling commission”\nfrom the casino. In accordance with this alleged agreement, the\nPlaintiff was said to have opened a credit account with Marina Bay\nSands casino (“MBS”) whereby the Plaintiff enjoyed a credit line\nup to $500,000. In this way, the Plaintiff was alleged to have withdrawn\nchips which were passed to businessmen and friends of the Plaintiff\nand Defendant. This was said to result in the Plaintiff securing\na commission. 8       By\ndoing this, the Defendant alleged that the Plaintiff was acting\nas a junket in contravention of s 110(1) of the Casino Control Act\n(Cap 33A, 2007 Rev Ed) (“CCA”). In addition, the Defendant pleaded\nthat the Plaintiff was acting as a moneylender by providing chips\non credit contrary to s 108(9) of the CCA. According to the Defendant,\nby December 2011, the Plaintiff was indebted to MBS as a result\nof gambling losses, and it was the Defendant who then “suggested”\nthat the Plaintiff borrow money from Foo, a mutual friend, so as\nto discharge his indebtedness to MBS. Subsequently, the Plaintiff\nrepaid Foo by means of the cheque payment of $730,000 that was referred\nto in the Plaintiff’s Statement of Claim. As for the alleged attempted\npart payment, the Defendant’s explanation was that the cheque of\n$100,000 was presented to the Plaintiff to cover the gambling losses which\nhad been incurred by “one of the Defendant’s friends”. The cheque was\nsupposed to be by way of security pending payment by the friend\n(and not to be presented without informing the Defendant). Therefore, according\nto the Defendant, he did not owe the sum of $730,000 as this was really\nthe sum paid off to Foo. 9       To\ncap off the defence, the Defendant also asserted that in any case,\nif it was found otherwise, the alleged debt was unenforceable on\naccount of contravention of the CCA. The Settlement Agreement 10     Whatever\nthe parties’ position in the First Suit, this eventually culminated\nin a Settlement Agreement between the parties settling the First Suit.\nAs the Settlement Agreement was the basis of the Plaintiff’s claim\nin the Second Suit, parties in the Second Suit had attempted to\nexplain their rationale for entering into this Settlement Agreement,\nwhich I now briefly state for background purposes. 11     Given\nthe claim and defence filed in the First Suit, the adequacy and/or\ninterpretation of the Acknowledgement of Debt was of some importance.\nIn Summons No 5598 of 2012 (“Sum 5598”), the Defendant had applied\nto expunge certain portions of the Plaintiff’s affidavit dated 16 October\n2012 (pursuant to another Summons No 5334 of 2012), which contained\nan admission note dated 3 October 2012. Sum 5598 came before the\nlearned Assistant Registrar Boey Yi Ling Germaine (“AR Boey”), who dismissed\nthe application. On appeal (Registrar’s Appeal No 501 of 2012), Lai\nSiu Chiu J reversed AR Boey’s decision, thereby expunging the admission\nnote of 3 October 2012 that the Plaintiff had hoped to rely on.[note: 1]The Plaintiff asserts that\nthis was the context that explains why he was amenable to a settlement\n– by way of a compromise as to their different positions in the\nFirst Suit.[note: 2] 12     The\nDefendant asserts that he was amenable to a settlement even though\nhe “appreciated the strength” of his position.[note: 3]The First Suit was settled as\n“litigation was proving to be too prolonged, contentious and costly”\nand also because the litigious proceedings “had a negative impact\non my business relationships” and would “impose further strain on\nme and worsen deteriorating business relations between myself and\nthe aforesaid third party friends.”[note: 4] 13     The\nSettlement Agreement was signed on 1 February 2013 as subsequently\nsupplemented by an exchange of letters dated 5 February 2013 between\nthe Plaintiff and Defendant’s solicitors. I elaborate further on\nthe Settlement Agreement below at [19] to [24], but suffice to state\nfor now the main terms of the Settlement Agreement were that the\nclaim for $730,000 in the First Suit was to be settled as follows:[note: 5] (a)     Payment\nof $100,000 in cash to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)\nno later than 28 February 2013. (b)     Payment\nof $230,000 in cash to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)\nno later than 31 March 2013. (c)     Delivery\nby the Defendant to the Plaintiff (or his authorised representative)\nof share transfer forms in respect of 11,500,000 ordinary shares\nin the capital of Firstlink (with the relevant share certificates)\nno later than 15 February 2013. In the event that this was not done,\nthe Defendant would be immediately liable to pay the sum of $400,000. (d)     Provision\nthat if the Defendant failed to meet the above obligations by the\ndates as provided that the Defendant would forthwith become liable\nfor all amounts not so paid. 14     In\naccordance with the Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff filed a notice\nof discontinuance in the First Suit on 5 February 2013. Subsequently, the\nDefendant caused the share transfer forms together with the relevant share\ncertificates to be delivered to the Plaintiff.[note: 6]The\nDefendant, however, failed to make the other payments.",
        "The Second Suit": "15     As\na result of the Defendant’s failure to fully satisfy the terms of\nthe Settlement Agreement, the Plaintiff commenced the Second Suit\nwhere he claimed against the Defendant the balance owing under the\nSettlement Agreement (ie, $330,000\nwhich is $730,000 less the value of the Firstlink shares). 16     The\nDefence filed in the Second Suit is essentially run on two main fronts.\nPut briefly, the first defence is that the Settlement Agreement\nis tainted by the very same “illegality” which affected the Plaintiff’s\nclaim in the First Suit (I refer to this as “the illegality defence”).\nThe second is that there was an “understanding” that the Defendant\nwould seek to recover the sum of $330,000 from certain third party\nfriends who had incurred gaming losses and to thereafter hand the\nmonies over to the Plaintiff. In short, the second defence is that\nthe Defendant was never personally liable as such for the $330,000\nand that what was required was that he should try to recover the\nmonies from third party friends despite the terms of the Settlement Agreement.[note: 7] 17     In\nthe Reply filed in the Second Suit, the Plaintiff (save for any admissions\nin the Reply) joined issues with the Defendant on the Defence. Insofar\nas the allegations that the Plaintiff was acting as a junket operator\nat MBS and that the debts were incurred in that context, the Plaintiff\npleaded that the allegations were largely “verbatim repeats” of\nwhat had been pleaded by the Defendant in the First Suit and that\nthe Defendant should be fully aware of the Plaintiff’s position.[note: 8]The\nPlaintiff in the Second Suit also asserts that the defence filed\nin the First Suit (ie, that he was\nrunning a junket operation and was moneylending) was irrelevant\nto the claim in the Second Suit and that in any case, all issues\narising from the First Suit had been “fully and finally settled”\nas between the Plaintiff and the Defendant by virtue of the Settlement\nAgreement. For good measure, the Plaintiff also pleads that the\nDefendant never applied to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim in the\nFirst Suit and that it was the Defendant who approached the Plaintiff\nfor settlement discussions.[note: 9] 18     Insofar\nas the pleadings filed in the Second Suit are concerned, it is noted\nthat the Plaintiff does not make any express reference to the assertion that\nthe Settlement Agreement arose out of earlier litigation said to\nconcern gaming debts and an illicit junket operation. Whilst the\nPlaintiff did generally join issues with the defence, the main position\ntaken on the assertion of gaming debts and junket operation is that\neven if the Plaintiff had acted as a junket operator, there was\nno allegation or suggestion that the Plaintiff had extended any\ncredit to the Defendant in the form of non-negotiable chips or that\nthe Defendant was a customer of the Plaintiff in the junket business.[note: 10]Referring\nback to the Acknowledgement of Debt which formed the basis of the\nFirst Suit, the Plaintiff in the written submissions states that\nthe Defendant never explained how the debt owed to Foo and paid\nby the Plaintiff on behalf of the Defendant was unenforceable by\nvirtue of the alleged junket operations. Instead, the Plaintiff\nnotes that the defence position in the First Suit on the debt owed\nto Foo was that the sum of $730,000 was actually an amount borrowed\nby the Plaintiff from Foo and that the cheque made out to Foo by\nthe Plaintiff was in fact repayment of the Plaintiff’s debt to Foo.",
        "The striking out application\nand the Settlement Agreement": "19     The\nPlaintiff later took out Sum 3506 on 10 July 2013, which was an application\nfor summary judgment in the Second Action. Central to this application\nwas the parties’ position on the Settlement Agreement, which I elaborate\non now.[note: 11] 20     The\nSettlement Agreement is dated 1 February 2013 and was signed by\nthe Plaintiff and the Defendant. It refers to the First Suit, sets\nout the various terms of the settlement (see [13] above) and concludes\nwith the provision that: Subject to and based on the above, the\nparties agree that the Suit is fully and finally settled as between\nthem. This Agreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance\nwith, the laws of Singapore. 21     On\n5 February 2013, an exchange of letters took place between the solicitors\nfor the Plaintiff and Defendant.[note: 12]The essence of these letters\nis that the Defendant’s solicitor confirmed that the Defendant had\nentered into the Settlement Agreement in accordance with the terms\nsummarised earlier subject to the Plaintiff filing a discontinuance\nof the First Suit. The confirmation letter from the Defendant’s\nsolicitor makes no reference at all to any terms or conditions other\nthan those that have been referred to. Specifically, there is no\nmention of any understanding or arrangement to the effect that the\nDefendant’s liability for the cash payments under the settlement\nwas linked in any way to the recovery by the Defendant of the same\nfrom the third party friends. There is no dispute that the notice\nof discontinuance was indeed filed on time by the Plaintiff. Indeed,\nit is also clear that on or around 28 February 2013, the Defendant\ndelivered the share transfer forms and share certificates.[note: 13] 22     By\ndoing so, the Plaintiff’s case is that Defendant (albeit late) had “partly\nperformed” the Settlement Agreement and demonstrated that “he considered\nhimself bound by the agreement.”[note: 14]When the delivery of the share\ntransfer forms and certificates was made, there was no indication made\nof any modification or qualification to the written terms of the Settlement\nAgreement.[note: 15] 23     The\nDefendant’s explanation of the return of the shares is rather different.\nAccording to the Defendant, the Defendant purchased 11,500,000 ordinary\nshares in the Plaintiff’s company sometime in 2011.[note: 16]This\nwas alleged to have been done with the encouragement of the Plaintiff.\nThe Defendant asserts that he wanted to return these shares and\nfelt that this could be done by means of settlement of the First\nSuit. To this end, the Defendant states that they agreed that the\nshares would be assigned a value of $400,000[note: 17].\nThe Defendant adds that the transfer of the shares was “fundamental”\nto the settlement and that he agreed to transfer the shares by way\nof settlement of his “limited liability” in respect of the gaming\nlosses of $730,000 said to have been incurred by the “Plaintiff\nand our friends” at MBS.[note: 18]By “limited liability”\nit appears that the Defendant is referring (at least in part) to\nhis “liability” to recover the monies borrowed/losses incurred by\nthe Defendant’s friends under the alleged illegal junket scheme.\n The Defendant asserts that he never admitted personal liability\nfor the sum of $330,000 and that he had reached an understanding\nwith the Plaintiff that the Defendant would recover the sum of $330,000\n“from our mutual friends”.[note: 19] 24     In\nany case, as mentioned above, the Defendant’s position is also that the\nSettlement Agreement was tainted by illegality and therefore should\nnot be enforced by the courts. I will elaborate on this illegality\ndefence at [38] to [46] below where I discuss my findings.",
        "The decision of the AR": "25     Sum\n3506 came before the AR who, on 28 August 2013, granted the Defendant\nleave to defend upon the condition that Defendant provided security\nof $330,000 in the form of a banker’s guarantee by 18 September 2013.\nIn his brief grounds of decision, the reason was that: … although the Defendant appears to have\nraised a triable issue … in the form of the illegality argument,\nnamely that the debt arose out of circumstances in which the Plaintiff\nwould be deemed an unlicensed moneylender pursuant to section 108\nof the Casino Control Act read with section 14 of the Moneylenders\nAct, this defence is shadowy in nature and does not justify the\ngranting of unconditional leave to defend. 26     The\nAR also stated that he decided to grant conditional leave because the\nevidence adduced by the Plaintiff (essentially the acknowledgment\nnote from Foo and the cheque image): …falls just short of what in my view is\nrequired to rebut the Defendant’s assertions that the transaction\nunderlying the settlement agreement was unlicensed moneylending. 27     Significantly,\nthe AR also found that the Defendant’s assertion that there was\nan oral agreement (to the effect that the Defendant was only required\nto pay $330,000 under the Settlement Agreement if and when the Defendant\nmanaged to recover the same from the third party friends) was unsubstantiated.\n The AR’s view was that that there was simply no evidence to support\nthe existence of such an agreement which would allow him to place\nany weight on the assertion for the purposes of the application\nbefore him. The Defendant had merely made a bare assertion as to\nthe oral agreement and had never mentioned such an oral agreement\nin any of the earlier communications with the Plaintiff.",
        "The issues before this court": "28     Given\nthe findings of the AR, the only issue before this court is whether\nthe AR had erred in law in granting the defendant conditional leave\nto defend having in mind that the illegality defence was “shadowy\nin nature”.  The legal issue before this court is, therefore, whether\nhaving settled the First Suit, the Defendant can or should be allowed\nto raise the illegality defence again as a means of undermining\nthe Settlement Agreement,viz, in\narguing that the Settlement Agreement is tainted by the alleged\nillegality in the First Suit.",
        "Applicable Legal Principles:\nSummary Judgment": "29     Before\nexamining the illegality defence, I first discuss the applicable legal\nprinciples pertaining to an application for summary judgment. Order 14\nr 1 of the ROC provides that: 1.Application by plaintiff for summary\njudgment (O. 14, r. 1) Where a statement of claim has been served\non a defendant and that defendant has served a defence to the statement\nof claim, the plaintiff may on the ground that that defendant has\nno defence to a claim included in the writ … apply to the Court\nfor judgment against that defendant. 30     The\nprinciples governing the grant of summary judgement are well known\nand will be referred to in brief. As the author inSingapore\nCivil Procedure 2013(G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &\nMaxwell, 2013) (“Selvam on Singapore Civil\nProcedure”) explains, the purpose of a summary judgment\nis to enable a plaintiff to obtain a quick judgment where there\nis plainly no defence to the claim. At para 14/1/2, he further states\nthat: [i]f the defendant’s only suggested defence\nis a point of law and the court can see at once that the point is\nmisconceived (or if arguable can be shown shortly to be plainly\nunsustainable) the plaintiff is entitled to judgment. 31     On\nthe other hand, the author continues to state that summary judgment\nis not appropriate if the case lends itself to determining points\nof law or construction that may take hours or even days and the\ncitation of many authorities before the court is in a position to\narrive at a final decision. 32     Order\n14 r 3 of the ROC goes on to provide that unless the court dismisses\nthe application or the defendant satisfies the court that there\nis an issue or question in dispute which ought to be tried or that\nthere ought for some other reason to be a trial of the claim (in\nwhole or part), the court may give judgment for the plaintiff. Where\nthe court determines that leave to defend is appropriate, O 14 r\n4 provides that the leave may either be unconditional or on terms\nsuch as the provision of security. In deciding whether it is appropriate\nto grant summary judgment, it has been said that even an assertion\nof fraud is not necessarily sufficient to avoid summary judgment\nif the court believes that there is no prospect of success at trial (seeGanesan Carlose & Partners v American Home Assurance\nCo[1994] 2 SLR 332). On the other hand, this court is\nreminded that a defendant is not to be shut out from defending unless\nit is very clear that there is no defence. IndeedSelvam\non Singapore Civil Procedureat para 14/4/5 states that “where\nthe defence can be described as more than shadowy but less than probable,\nleave to defend should be given.” 33     In\ndeciding whether leave to defend should be granted, the court is also\nreminded that leave to defend is to be granted not simply in cases where\nthere appears to be a fair case for defence but also where there\nis “some other reason” for a trial. Whilst the latter words are\nof wide scope, ordinarily, it is suggested, there should be some\nconnection between the “other reason” and the substantive merits\nof the Plaintiff’s claim. Tricky questions can arise where the reason\n(or even the main reason) why the Defendant wants a trial is because\nof publicity. That said,Selvam on Singapore\nCivil Procedureat para 14/4/6 gives the example of a\ndecision where the plaintiff’s case tended to show that he had acted\nharshly or unconscionably and it is thought desirable that if he\nwere to get judgment at all it should be in the full light of publicity\n(citingBank fur Gemeinwirtshaft AG v City\nof London Garages Ltd[1971] 1 All ER 541 at 548). Yet\nanother example cited was the decision of Chan Sek Keong J (as he\nthen was) inConcentrate Engineering Pte Ltd\nv United Malayan Banking Corporation Bhd[1990] SLR 514.\nThe latter was a case where the evidence showed a bold and unusual\nscheme to defraud by use of apparently forged cheques. In these\ncircumstances, the defendant bank suspected that someone inside\nthe plaintiff was involved. The decision of Chan Sek Keong J was\nthat the sheer audacity of the sophisticated fraud and the absence\nof explanation by the plaintiff’s directors was “some other reason”\nfor a trial. That said, it does not follow that leave to defend\nis always appropriate simply because there are background criminal\ninvestigations or that the defendant needs more time.   Each case\nfor summary judgment must, of course, turn on its own facts. Where\nit is clear that there is no defence, the fact that the court disapproves\nof the general behaviour of the Plaintiff or parties is not a reason\nto deny summary judgment. The position will be different if the unconscionable\nconduct of the Plaintiff opens the door to a possible defence. 34     In\na similar vein, Jeffrey Pinsler SC inPrinciples\nof Civil Procedure, (Academy Publishing, 2013) (“Pinsler on Principles of Civil Procedure”)\nat 266 states that since summary judgment is: … a final judgment, which disregards fact\nfinding procedures leading to a thorough adjudication at trial,\nthe court would want to be satisfied that there is no other reason\nwhy the case should go through the normal case of litigation. 35     The\ncaveat stated inPinsler on Principles of Civil\nProcedureat 267 also bears underscoring: [A] defendant must show clear justification\nfor his reliance on this ground. A vague allegation that a case\nneeds to be investigated in the absence of good reason would not\nconstitute some other reason for trial. 36     Where\nleave to defend is appropriate, an issue may arise as to whether the\nleave should be unconditional or subject to terms.Selvam\non Singapore Civil Procedureat para 14/4/12 explains\nthat granting leave to defend subject to terms such as provision\nof security is appropriate in those cases where there is good ground\nfor believing that the defence is a sham defence and where the court\nis very nearly prepared to give judgment. In this respect, it has\noften been said that conditional leave is appropriate where the\ndefence is “shadowy” or “suspicious”. Whilst these adjectives may\nbe of some (limited) assistance, it is necessary to bear in mind\nthe principle that lies behind the exercise of the discretion. To\nthis end, the comments of Sundaresh Menon JC (as he then was) inAbdul Salam Asanaru Pillai v Nomanbhoy & Sons\nPte Ltd[2007] 2 SLR(R) 856 bear repeating. In that case the\ncourt stated that the multitude of terms used such as “a real doubt\nabout the defendant’s good faith”, “shadowy”, “sham”, “suspicious”,\n“hardly of substance” were somewhat “pejorative” and which may obscure\nthe true principle. In his view, imposition of a condition on the\nleave to defend was appropriate in those cases where the court is\nof the view that whilst it cannot be said that the claimed defence\nis so hopeless that in truth there is no defence, that “the overall\nimpression is such that some demonstration of commitment on the\npart of the defendant to the claimed defence is called for.” It\nfollows that unconditional leave to defend should be granted where there\nis a reasonable ground (fair probability) for a defence. On the\nother hand, where the court is satisfied that there is no defence,\nit would not be appropriate to permit the defendant to “purchase”\nleave to defend by means of payment of security for the claim. Conditional\nleave may be most appropriate in those cases where the apparent\nstrength of the claimed defence lies somewhere between (reasonable\nground and no defence) coupled with some doubt as to the sincerity\nof the defendant’s position or intention to defend. Clearly, however,\nthe interplay between these two points will depend on the circumstances\nof each case. 37     With\nthese principles in mind, I now turn to discuss whether the AR had\nerred in granting the Defendant conditional leave to defend (hence dismissing\nthe application for summary judgment) in the light of the illegality\ndefence.",
        "Should the Defendant be allowed\nto raise the very same set of issues again as a means of undermining\nthe Settlement Agreement,vizin\narguing that the Settlement Agreement is tainted by the alleged\nillegality in the First Suit?": "",
        "The illegality/money-lending\nargument": "38     The\nillegality defence asserted is predicated on the submissions that the\nsubject sum of the Second Suit, $330,000, was derived from illegal gambling\nactivities which the Plaintiff was involved in. In the Defendant’s written\nsubmissions, it is said that the sum was the total of the illegal gambling\ndebts incurred and owed to the Plaintiff by certain third party friends.\nThe Settlement Agreement reached in the First Suit and which was the\nbasis of the claim in the Second Suit is said to have been entered\ninto on the premise that the Plaintiff and Defendant preserve their\nbusiness relations and friendship and that in this regard the Defendant\nwould not expose further details of the Plaintiff’s illegal junket\noperations. Even though the Plaintiff (in the Second Suit) is suing\non the basis of the Settlement Agreement, the Defendant asserts\nthat the gaming matters of the First Suit are not irrelevant since\nany settlement agreement founded on an illegal gambling debt was\ndefective and that, once tainted, any residual claim based on the\nSettlement Agreement must be unenforceable. 39     Section\n108(9)(a) of the CCA provides that: 108.—(9)\nAny person who — (a)    provides chips on credit\nto persons other than as permitted in subsection (7) or (7A) shall\nbe deemed to be a moneylender for the purposes of the Moneylenders\nAct (Cap.188); … 40     Subsections\n(7) and (7A) are concerned with the provision of chips on credit\nby a casino operator and a licensed international market agent and are\nnot relevant to the proceedings at hand. In addition the Defendant\nrelies on s 110(1) of the CCA which provides that: Prohibited\ncasino marketing arrangements 110.—(1) No person shall organise or conduct a casino marketing arrangement\nwhich involves the participation of any citizen of Singapore or permanent\nresident of Singapore. 41     A\n“casino marketing arrangement” is defined in s 2(1) of the CCA (with\nparticular reference to s 2(1)(a))\nas: … an arrangement whereby a person organises,\npromotes or facilitates the playing of any game in a casino by one\nor more patrons, for which the first-mentioned person receives from\nthe casino operator or from the person for the time being in charge\nof the casino (a)    a commission based on\nthe turnover of play in the casino attributable to the patron or\npatrons or otherwise derived from the play of the patron or patrons; … 42     It\nwill be recalled that the basic position of the Defendant in the\nFirst Suit was that the Plaintiff had opened an account at MBS and\nthat he would from time to time withdraw non-negotiable chips to\npass to friends and business associates to use for gaming purposes.\nBy doing this, the Plaintiff was said to have earned a rolling commission. 43     Assuming\nthat the Plaintiff was acting contrary to s 108(9)(a)\nof the CCA, the Defendant’s submission was that the Plaintiff was\nalso caught by s 14(2) of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev\nEd) (“MLA”), which provides that: 14.—(2) where any contract for a loan has\nbeen granted by an unlicensed moneylender, or any guarantee or security\nhas been given for such a loan — (a) the\ncontract for the loan, and the guarantee or security, as the case may\nbe, shall be unenforceable; and (b) any\nmoney paid by or on behalf of the unlicensed moneylender under the\ncontract for the loan shall not be recoverable in any court of law. 44     In\naddition, reference should also be made here to ss 5(1) and 5(6)\nof the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) which provide\nthat: Agreement\nby way of gaming or wagering to be null and void 5.—(1) All contracts or agreements,\nwhether by parol or in writing, by way of gaming or wagering shall\nbe null and void. … Promises\nto repay sums paid under such contracts to be null and void (6)    Any promise, express or implied, to\npay any person any sum of money paid by him under or in respect\nof any contract or agreement rendered null and void by subsections\n(1) and (2), or to pay any sum of money by way of commission, fee,\nreward or otherwise in respect of any such contract or of any services\nin relation thereto or in connection therewith, shall be null and void,\nand no action shall be brought or maintained to recover any such\nsum of money 45     On\nthis basis, the defence in the First Suit was that the alleged debt owed\nwas in respect of gaming arrangements that were rendered null and void\nby s 14(2) of the MLA and ss 5(1) and 5(6) of the CLA. 46     The\nPlaintiff in the First Suit, it will be recalled, pleaded that the Defendant\nowed a sum of $730,000 to Foo, which debt had been paid by Plaintiff\non behalf of the Defendant. The Defendant was said to have acknowledged\nthis and had undertaken to repay the Plaintiff. It will be recalled\nthat the Settlement Agreement for $730,000 was reached shortly after\nthe Plaintiff encountered difficulties in obtaining summary judgment in\nthe First Suit because of concerns over the Acknowledgement of Debt which\nthe Defendant had signed.[note: 20]There\nwas no finding by any court that the Plaintiff was in fact running\nan illegal junket operation or that he was otherwise, in breach\nof, or caught by provisions of the CCA, MLA or CLA. Indeed, it bears\nrepeating that it remains unclear as to what if any connection there\nwas between the debt owed to Foo and the alleged junket/gaming activities.\nThe allegations made by the Defendant were very serious and had\nnot been established at the time when the First Suit was settled.\nThere can be no doubt that if the First Suit had gone to trial,\nthere would likely have been considerable dispute over the facts\n(never mind the law) over the relationship between the parties and\nvarious “third party friends”. Even though the Defendant had made\nserious allegations in the First Suit, it is important to take note\nthat at the time of the Settlement, there was no finding at all\nof illicit moneylending and it was by no means certain that the\nDefendant would have been able to establish the moneylending/gaming\ndefence.",
        "The Validity and Effect of the\nSettlement Agreement": "47     I\ncome now to the crux of the legal issue which is whether the Defendant\nshould be allowed to raise the same illegality defence as a means of\nundermining the Settlement Agreement, in arguing that the Settlement Agreement\nis affected by the alleged illegality in the First Suit. This is bearing\nin mind the fact that there was no conclusive finding of any illegality\nin the First Suit given that parties entered into a Settlement Agreement\nbefore this issue could be determined. 48     The\nposition of the Defendant in the Second Suit is that the validity\nof the Settlement Agreement is affected or tainted by the same illegality\nwhich made the debt irrecoverable in the First Suit,ie, that it was premised on a gaming and/or\nmoneylending contract and was, therefore, unenforceable. Parties\nhave raised a number of cases in support of their arguments, and\nI now turn to discuss their applicability in the present case before\nme. Tan Sim Lay v Lim Kiat Seng\n[1996] 2 SLR(R) 147 49     InTan Sim Lay v Lim Kiat Seng[1996] 2 SLR(R)\n147 (“Tan Sim Lay”), the defendant\nhad admitted a debt and agreed to pay a sum of money to the plaintiff\nin consideration of the plaintiff forbearing to sue on the said\ndebt. When the plaintiff brought an action for breach of the agreement,\nthe defendant averred that the agreement was a settlement agreement\narising from a series of unlawful moneylending transactions in which\nthe plaintiff had lent money as an unlicensed moneylender to the\ndefendant. The plaintiff, on the other hand, alleged that the monies\nwere advanced purely as investment in the defendant’s money changing\nbusiness. When the case was heard by Choo Han Teck JC (as he then\nwas), the learned judicial commissioner found (at [15]) that there\nwas not the slightest evidence that the plaintiff’s dealings with\nthe defendant could be regarded as conventional business investments.\nThe court held that the monies advanced were clearly loans and that: [i]nterest was payable on these loans and\nwere just as dubiously dubbed profits. The undisputed evidence was\nthat the profits were not only fixed in advance but were at a rate\nup to 152% per annum, clearly exorbitant. 50     Choo\nJC, therefore, held at [20] that the plaintiff had used the term “investment”\nto camouflage “blatant moneylending transactions.” 51     In\nthe present case, the Defendant citesTan Sim\nLayas authority for the proposition that it is not the\ncourt’s position that the terms of a settlement agreement made between\nthe parties is conclusively theonlyevidence\nor foundation upon which the court will decide the liability of\na defendant. The validity of the settlement agreement would depend\nin part on whether the original dispute that was settled was one\nwhich was tainted by moneylending. That said, it is to be noted\nthatTan Sim Laywas a decision\nreached after trial and was based on the finding that the plaintiff had\nindeed acted as a moneylender in loaning monies to the defendant. That\nbeing so, Choo J found that the agreement which had been entered into\nfor the settlement of the various moneylending transactions was caught\nby the MLA. 52     In\nthe present case, however, there has been no finding of moneylending/gaming\nin the First Suit. Notwithstanding the seriousness of the allegations\nof the Defendant, it cannot be said with confidence that the moneylending/gaming\ndefence would have succeeded if the First Suit had gone to trial.\nThe question is whether the Defendant, having chosen to enter into\na settlement agreement over the First Suit, should now be entitled to\nraise the same legal arguments (ie,\nthe illegality defence) which had been raised but not conclusively\ndecided in the First Suit. If the Defendant is entitled to raise\nthe same legal arguments, then at trial in the Second Suit, the\nDefendant could potentially be able to establish that the $730,000 referred\nto in the Settlement Agreement is in respect of gaming debts, and therefore\na serious question will arise as to whether a defence based on the MLA\nand CLA is made out. However, since this was not the case inTan Sim Lay, I find that it does little\nto aid the Defendant’s arguments in this appeal. Quek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee\nPah Jimmy [2000] 3 SLR(R) 761 53Quek Chiau Beng v Phua Swee Pah Jimmy[2000]\n3 SLR(R) 761 (“Quek Chiau Beng”)\nconcerned a claim for monies owed (S$160,000) in respect of gaming\nat a casino in Australia. The sum of money owed was apparently endorsed\non certain baccarat score cards. The plaintiff in his claim asserted\nthat he was a licensed junket operator at the casino and that the\ndefendant had obtained un-cashable rolling chips from the plaintiff’s representative.\nThe defendant, whilst admitting that he gambled at the casino, denied\nobtaining the chips from the plaintiff. Instead, his evidence was\nthat the plaintiff’s father had promised to extend him credit to\ngamble at the casino and that he had obtained the chips from the\nplaintiff’s father. The plaintiff applied for summary judgment based\non the sum as set out on the score card (which was exhibited in\nthe affidavit filed in support). In holding that the monies were\nnot recoverable under s 5(2) of the CLA, G P Selvam J noted that\nthere was no mention anywhere in the documents that there was any\nloan. Instead, the allegations and evidence (as pleaded and set out\nin the affidavits) was that the defendant had betted on baccarat\nand had lost heavily. The learned judge found (in the context of\nan application for summary judgment under O 14 r 1 of the ROC) that\nthe defendant was being sued to recover a gambling debt. That being\nso, s 5(2) of the CLA applied. All contracts or agreements by way\nof gaming were null and void,ie,nudum pactum. 54     In\ncoming to his decision, the learned judge commented at [8] that the\ngaming section of CLA did not render gambling illegal as such. The purpose\nwas to put down gambling on credit. He stated as follows: It means that the winner has no legal remedy\nagainst the loser to recover his wins. Illegality and ineffectiveness,\nthat is nullity, are two different concepts. … … under the gaming section our courts are\nnot allowed to collect gambling debts for casinos and junket operators.\nThe courts will not permit a gambling debt to sneak in in disguise,\neg as a loan or sale contract for chips. 55     Selvam\nJ observed at [15] that: [t]he evidence (including the evidence\nof the defendant) show that what is sought is a gambling loss. When\ncounsel spoke of a loan it was his wishful thinking… when was a\nloan made? How much money was given as a loan? Where was it given?\nWho gave it? What was the currency of the loan? There is no hint\nof any of these matters in the pleadings or the affidavits. The\nreality of the situation was that there was a gaming debt. 56     That\nbeing so, the defendant was granted unconditional leave to defend\n(reversing the decision below which had granted conditional leave). 57     Whilst\nit is understandable for the Defendant in the present case to citeQuek Chiau Beng, it is to be noted that\non the basis of the pleadings and affidavits it wasclearto\nSelvam J that the debt was not incurred by way of a loan – it was\na gambling debt which arose out of bets placed on baccarat at the\nAustralian casino. That being so, unconditional leave to defend\nwas granted as the defendant inQuek Chiau\nBengappeared to have a good defence based on the evidence\nbefore the court. In the present case, the Plaintiff’s claim in\nthe First Suit was for recovery of a debt said to have been acknowledged\nby the Defendant. Whilst the Defendant has made assertions that\nthe basis of the First Suit in fact concerned an illicit junket\noperation and gaming, this was never conclusively established. In\nthe Plaintiff’s written submissions in Sum 3506 (the application\nfor summary judgment), the Plaintiff went on to argue that even\nif he had been running an unauthorised junket scheme in Singapore,\nthis had no bearing on the debt which the Defendant owed to the\nPlaintiff. That said, it bears repeating that the Plaintiff has,\nin general terms, joined issue with the Defendant and that an important\nreason as to why the AR declined to award summary judgment was because\nthe acknowledgement note fell just short of what was needed to rebut\nthe assertion that the transaction underlying the settlement was\nunlicensed money lending.  In contrast, Selvam J was not dealing\nwith a case where the claim was to enforce the terms of a settlement\nagreement: which agreement had been entered into to settle an earlier\ndispute in which there wereunprovenallegations\nof moneylending and gaming. Instead,Quek Chiau\nBengconcerned an application for summary judgment to recover\na sum of moneywhich on the pleadings and affidavits\nbefore the court concerned a gambling debt. It was in\nthis context that Selvam J held that for the purposes of s 5(2)\nCLA, it made no difference that the gaming was carried out with\ngaming chips and not cash. (Gaming chips are not money or money’s\nworth but counters for tracking the losses and wins.) Star Cruises Services Ltd v\nOverseas Union Bank Ltd [1999] 2 SLR(R) 183 58Star Cruises Services Ltd v Overseas Union Bank Ltd[1999]\n2 SLR(R) 183 (“Star Cruises”) is\nanother decision by Selvam J on the effect of a contract arising\nout of gaming. In that case, the plaintiff casino operator claimed\na sum of money from the defendant bank (OUB) in respect of three cashier’s\norders issued by OUB to the plaintiff. OUB in turn claimed that the\ncashier’s orders had been fraudulently issued by an employee in connection\nwith gambling transactions. In coming to his decision (in favour\nof OUB), the learned judge set out a helpful summary of the public policy\nreasons for the law’s aversion to gaming and wagering contracts\nand the attempts to circumvent rules against recovery of gambling\ndebts by lending monies to gamblers and attempts to recover the\ngaming debts by means of a claim for repayment of a loan. Selvam\nJ noted s 6(1)(2) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) (which\nlater was amended to the current s 5(1)(2) of CLA) and commented\n(at [68]) that: … [g]aming debts are not legal debts. The\ncourts of justice are out of bounds to claims based on gaming or\nwagering because no action can be brought or maintained to enforce\nthem. The doors of justice are closed to them. Sections 6(2) and\n6(5) have clamped down on credit gambling by denying legal remedy\nto enforce gaming debts and securities based on them. It has done\nso for public policy reasons with a history of some 450 years. 59     The\nlearned judge continues at [69] by holding that the clamp down … includes the accessory contracts before\nthe actual game and derivative contracts after the play. In the\ncase of a composite-contract, if the gaming contract is the central\nor matrix contract, the whole composite-contract comprising the\ncentral, accessory and derivative contracts are voided … 60     The\ndecision inStar Cruisesarose after\na trial which led Selvam J hold (at [105]) that all the cashier’s\norders represented gaming lossesie,\nmoney won by way of gambling at the plaintiff’s casino. In the present\ncase, there has yet to be a trial and the application is for summary\njudgment based on the written terms of a Settlement Agreement. The\nSettlement Agreement does not on its face indicate or state that\nthe payments to be made are in respect of gaming losses. That said,\nthe Settlement Agreement clearly concerns and relates to the claims\nbrought in the First Suit where gaming assertions had been made\n(but not yet established) by the Defendant. As I had observed earlier,\nthe real issue before this court is whether (in the context of an\napplication for summary judgment) the Defendant should be allowed\nor given another opportunity to raise the same (unproven)\ngaming issues that were supposedly settled by agreement. Is this\na case where the court should adopt a holistic approach and look\nat the Settlement Agreement in the context of the alleged transactions\nas a whole so as to take a composite approach? If so, the fact that\nthe characteristics of the alleged earlier transaction (the circumstances\nin which the debt arose that was the subject of the First Suit)\nis unclear and in real dispute must also be a relevant consideration\nas is discussed below. Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace\nInc [2010] 1 SLR 1129 61Poh Soon Kiat v Desert Palace Inc[2010]\n1 SLR 1129 (“Poh Soon Kiat”) was\na case where Desert Palace Inc (the respondent) had brought a suit\nin Singapore against the appellant in respect of which an application\nfor summary judgment was made. The suit was based on a claim to\nenforce a foreign judgment obtained in 2001 in the State of California,\nUSA. The Californian judgment had set aside a transfer of property\nby the appellant (on the basis of fraud) and had also ordered the\nproperty to be sold and for the sale proceeds to be made available\nto satisfy judgment debts owing to the Respondent obtained in 1999\n(from the same court). The judgment obtained in 1999 was itself\nbased on an earlier US District Court (Nevada) decision that was\nbased on a gambling debt owed by the appellant to the respondent.\nThe High Court in Singapore found for the Respondent on the basis\nthat the 2001 Californian judgment was enforceable in Singapore\nand that there was no defence to the action. On appeal, Chan Sek\nKeong CJ surveyed the Singapore law and public policy on gambling\nand came to the conclusion (at [95]) that the introduction of casino\ngambling in Singapore under strict controls did not abrogate the\npublic policy that was encapsulated in s 5(2) of the CLA. The Chief\nJustice continued (at [97] and [98]) that there was a clear difference\nbetween regulated casino gambling and unregulated gaming at large\n(including gambling on credit) and that “the existence of regulated\ngambling is not inconsistent with unregulated gambling and gambling\non credit being against public policy in Singapore.” That said,\nthe Court of Appeal held (at [127]) that the 2001 Californian judgment\nwas not enforceable by way of a common law action as it was not a\nforeign money judgment. The Court of Appeal went on to observe (indicta) however, that it appeared that\ns 5(2) CLA would also have barred the action since the action on\nthe foreign judgment was based on an underlying cause of action\nconcerning a gambling debt. 62     In\ncoming to its decision, the Court of Appeal inPoh\nSoon Kiatreferred to the earlier decisions ofStar City Pty Ltd (formerly known as Sydney Harbour\nCasino Pty Ltd) v Tan Hong Woon[2002] 1 SLR(R) 306 (“Star City”) andBurswood\nNominees Ltd v Liao Eng Kiat[2004] 2 SLR(R) 436 (“Burswood”). InStar\nCity, the Court of Appeal (at [30]) came to the view\nthat Singapore (in line with the position in England) had departed from\nthe historical position that gambling and gaming, especially on\ncredit, was a social vice that had to be eradicated at all costs.\nYong Pung How CJ at [30] expressed the view that: …[g]amblingper seis\nno longer considered to be contrary to the public interest and this\naccounts for the various forms of legalised gaming and gambling\nwhich currently exists in Singapore such as 4-D, Toto, the Big Sweep,\nthe Singapore Turf Club,etc. Therefore\nthere is no general principle of public policy in Singapore, against\nthe recovery of money lent for the purposes of gambling abroad,\nso long if (sic) the transaction\nis indeed a genuine loan and one which is valid and enforceable\naccording to that foreign law. 63     The\nlatter statement may now need to be reassessed in the light of thedictacomments inPoh\nSoon Kiat. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that even inStar City, Yong Pung How CJ went on to\naffirm (at [31]) that what was objectionable “is courts being used\nby casinos to enforce gambling debts in the ‘form’ of loans” and\nthat “the courts of justice must remain out of bounds to claims\nfor moneys won upon wagers, however cleverly or covertly disguised.”\nThe important point to note is that the “distinction” touched on\nin the latter case between gaming debts (monies lost on wagers) and\ngenuine loans to a borrower who uses the monies to gamble will doubtless\nrequire careful thought, even in those cases where the loan is valid and\nenforceable according to applicable foreign law. 64     InBurswood, the plaintiff was the operator\nof a licensed casino in Western Australia. The defendant had issued\na cheque to the plaintiff in exchange for a chip voucher. Subsequently,\nthe defendant lost the chips on the gaming tables and his cheque\nwhen presented for payment was dishonoured. The plaintiff obtained\na default judgment in a Western Australian court. The issue before\nthe Singapore court was whether the Western Australian judgment\nwas registrable under the Reciprocal Enforcement of Commonwealth\nJudgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed) (“RECJA”). Section 3(2)(f)\nof the RECJA prohibits the registration of a Commonwealth judgment\nif it was obtained in respect of a cause of action which for reasons\nof public policy could not be entertained by a Singapore court.\nThe Court of Appeal in that case held that the plaintiff’s claim\nwas for money won upon a wager and that if the plaintiff had commenced\nan action in Singapore on the dishonoured cheque that action would\nhave been barred by s 5(2) of the CLA. However, the Court of Appeal\nwent to state that s 5(2) was not applicable to the Western Australian\njudgment. Instead, s 3(2)(f) was applicable and was decisive of\nthe issue, the point being that an objection based on the latter\nrequired a higher threshold of public policy to be met. The Court\nof Appeal inBurswood(at [46])\nwas of the view that there were no public policy grounds militating\nagainst the registration of the Australian judgment which would\noffend a fundamental principle of justice or a deep rooted tradition\nof Singapore. InPoh Soon Kiat,\na differently constituted Court of Appeal (at [94]) disagreed with\nthe statement that gambling was no longer contrary to Singapore\npublic policy. If that was the position, there would have been no\nneed for such an extensive and detailed legislative and regulatory\nframework as set out in the CCA. Rather than repealing s 5 of the\nCLA, Parliament restructured s 5 so as to make ss 5(1) and (2) inapplicable\nto regulated gambling. Further, the Court of Appeal inPoh Soon Kiattook pains to stress that\nthe public policy objection encapsulated in s 5(2) CLA was not simply\nthe saving of precious judicial resources. Broader public interests\nlay at the heart of the provision. The decision inBurswoodwas\ncharacterised as unsound since the cause of action upon which the\nWestern Australian judgment was based was a gambling debt. Section\n5(2) CLA applied to all gambling debts and was clear expression\nof Singapore public policy. 65     In\nthe present case, the claim is not being brought by a casino against a\npatron who has incurred gaming losses at the casino tables. Taking\nthe Defendant’s pleaded case at its highest, what is being alleged\nis that the Plaintiff provided chips to his friends and business\nacquaintances to gamble at a casino in Singapore. Over time, the\nPlaintiff became indebted to the casino and sought to recover the\n“credit” that he had provided to these friends and associates. How\nthe Defendant “fit” into the scheme was not entirely clear. The\npoint is that if the First Suit had not been settled and had proceeded\nto a full trial, there would likely have been careful examination\nof the evidence to determine the facts (what was the relationship\nbetween Foo, the Plaintiff and Defendant; was it a genuine loan\ntransaction or something elseetc)\nand subsequently the law as applicable to gaming debts and loans. The\nquestion (broadly stated) before the court (as set out before) is\nwhether having settled the First Suit, the Defendant can or should\nbe allowed to raise the very same set of issues again as a means\nof undermining the Settlement Agreement. Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd\nv East Coast Properties Pte Ltd [2011] 2 SLR 758 66Real Estate Consortium Pte Ltd v East Coast Properties\nPte Ltd[2011] 2 SLR 758 (“Real\nEstate Consortium”) concerned the question as to the degree\nof finality to be accorded to settlement agreements (in terms of preventing\nparties from re-opening issues supposed to have been settled). The\ncase concerned disputes which had arisen from a convertible bond agreement\nbetween the plaintiff and the defendants (“the CBA”). About a year\nafter the CBA was executed, the defendants were unable to repay\nthe principal amount as a result of which the plaintiff by letter\nterminated the CBA. The defendants disputed the plaintiff’s rights\nunder the CBA. They also alleged that the CBA had been signed by\nthe second defendant without fully understanding the terms that\nthe CBA was a sham transaction, that the CBA was an unenforceable\nmoneylending transaction with an exorbitant interest rate and that\nthe CBA had wrongly terminated. Thereafter, the parties entered\ninto negotiations to settle the dispute and, after an exchange of\ncorrespondence, an instalment re-payment schedule was agreed with four\npost-dated cheques being delivered to the plaintiff. Three of these cheques\nwere subsequently dishonoured. The defendants’ case was to raise similar\npoints on the CBA (ie, that it was\nan act of moneylending, and that it was a shametc)\nas well as an assertion that the settlement agreement was not valid\nas it had been entered into under economic duress. The plaintiff denied\neconomic duress and claimed that the issues concerning the validity of\nthe CBA were no longer relevant as they had been settled between\nthe parties. 67     Andrew\nAng J found (at [42]) that it was clear that the issues had been compromised\nby a settlement agreement between the parties. The legal question\nthat arose was whether the settlement agreement had the effect of preventing\nthe defendants from resurrecting the same issues again. The learned\njudge held that they were precluded, and stated at [53] that: … [w]here parties have agreed to resolve\ntheir dispute amicably by way of a validly formed settlement agreement,\nthe settlement agreement alone governs the parties' legal relationship;\nthe effect of the settlement agreement is to put an end to the issues\npreviously raised by the defendants. This oft-stated principle has\nbeen regarded as self-evident as its rationale has seldom been adequately\narticulated. 68     Whilst\nthe rationale may not have been often explained, there is little doubt\nthat there is much good sense in the principle. If an agreement\nwas validly and properly entered into by way of compromising an\naction, the common intention of the parties must have been to compromise\nthat action in accordance with the terms of the agreement. If the\nterms of the agreement make it clear that the settlement agreement\nwas to exclusively govern the dispute and issues that had arisen\nthen that should be it and neither side will ordinarily be allowed\nto renege from what had been agreed. If it is intended that some\nissues remain “live” (either generally or in certain circumstances)\nthen this should be provided for in the agreement itself (although\nin some cases it may be that an appropriate term may be implied).\nWhether the basis for upholding the settlement agreement is contract\nor some form of estoppel (which Andrew Ang J at [58] inReal Estate Consortiumexpressed some\ndoubt towards), there can be no doubting the good sense (and arguments\nof public interest) in the law upholding agreements freely entered\ninto as part of the process of dispute resolution and in the interests\nof commercial certainty. Indeed, this was a point that was discussed\nin some detail by Andrew Ang J at [58] and [59] ofReal\nEstate Consortium. Singapore cases cited by the learned\njudge as supporting this view includeGay Choon\nIng v Loh Sze Ti Terence Peter[2009] 2 SLR(R) 332,Lee Kuan Yew v Chee Soon Juan[2003] 3\nSLR(R) 8, andShunmugam Jayakumar v Jeyaretnam\nJoshua Benjamin[1996] 2 SLR(R) 658. 69     That\nsaid, it must follow that, whilst the general rule is that the settlement\nagreement alone will govern the relationship between the parties,\nthere will be a residue of cases where the settlement agreementwill nothave the effect of preventing\nthe re-opening of disputes. The case cited for this proposition\nis the English Court of Appeal decision inBinder\nv Alachouzos[1972] 2 QB 151 (“Binder”).\nThat was a case where a lender had commenced an action against the\nborrower for default in the repayment of loans. The borrower’s defence\nwas that the loans were unenforceable. Before the trial, the action\nwas settled on terms that the borrower should make payment of a\nsum of money by way of instalments. It was agreed that the Moneylenders\nAct did not apply to the loan transactions. In that case, Lord Denning\nMR found that the dispute as to whether the lender was a moneylender\nhad already formed the subject matter of abona\nfidecompromise agreement. It followed that the dispute\ncould not be reopened unless the lender had taken “unfair advantage”\nof the borrower. One such instance given by Lord Denning was a case\nwhere the interest charged was so high that it was presumed to be\nharsh and unconscionable. But, and this is of some importance for\nthe case at hand, Lord Denning also stated at 158 that: [o]n the other hand, it is important that\nthe courts should enforce compromises which are agreed in good faith\nbetween the lender and borrower. If the court is satisfied that\nthe terms are fair and reasonable, then the compromise should be\nheld binding. For instance, if there is a genuine difference as\nto whether the lender is a moneylender or not, then it is open to the\nparties to enter into a bona fide agreement of compromise. Otherwise, there\ncould never be a compromise of such an action. Every case would\nhave to go to the court for final determination and decision. That\ncannot be right. 70     Andrew\nAng J inReal Estate Consortiumaccepted\nthat a compromise agreement was not an absolute bar to reopening\nof issues. Nevertheless, the learned judge rightly stressed at [61]\nthat inasmuch as the court will not make a contract for the parties,\nthat there was onlylimitedscope\nfor the court to determine whether the terms of the compromise was\nfair and reasonable. Examples given were cases where the prior issues\nwere tainted by illegality, fraud, duress, undue influence or mistake.\n At the end of the day, Andrew Ang J found that the parties had\nintended to enter into the settlement agreement and that there was\nno basis for the claim that the agreement was entered into under\neconomic duress. It was always open (at the time) for the defendants\nto have defended the claim and in any case the defendants had the\nbenefit of independent legal advice throughout the settlement negotiations. 71     Whilst\nthe relevance ofReal Estate Consortiumto\nthe present case is clear, it is necessary to bear in mind that\nthe latter was a case that went to trial and the decision reached\nonly after the normal trial process was complete.Real\nEstate Consortiumwas not a case where the matter was determined\non an application for summary judgment. The fact that there was\na full trial which enabled Andrew Ang J to hold that even if he\naccepted (for the sake of argument) that the issues could be re-opened,\nthe end result would have been the same. This is because the court\nin any case found (after trial) that there was no merit in the arguments\nthat had been raised. There was no basis for the plea of mistake,\nnor was there evidence to show that the second defendant was inexperienced.\nThe evidence that the CBA was a sham was not accepted as the evidence\nshowed that the defendants regarded the plaintiff’s financing as\nan investment in the property project. That being so, the allegation\nof moneylending was not made out. That said, it is clear that the\nlearned judge’s remarks and comments on the merit of the issues\npreviously raised were by way of caution and that his main holding\nremains: that there is only limited room to reopen issues that have been\nincluded in a settlement agreement.",
        "Application to the present case": "72     Now\nthat I have discussed a number of cases counsel cited to me, I now\napply the legal principles to the facts of the present appeal. 73     As\nnoted earlier, the Settlement Agreement in the present case was signed\nby both parties on 1 February 2013. The signatures were in the presence\nof two witnesses. Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement states that: [s]ubject to the above, the parties agree\nthat the Suit is fully and finally settled as between them. This\nAgreement is governed by and shall be construed in accordance with,\nthe laws of Singapore. 74     The\nSuit referred to was identified in the opening paragraph of the agreement\nas “S733/2012/J”. This, of course, is a direct reference to the\nFirst Suit discussed earlier. 75     On\n5 February 2013, the solicitors for the Plaintiff sent a letter\nto the solicitors for the Defendant noting and setting out the terms\nof the Settlement Agreement of 1 February 2013. By this letter,\nthe Plaintiff sought confirmation of the settlement and that, if\nthe sums were not paid as provided for, the Defendant would become\nliable for all amounts not so paid. By a letter on the same date,\nthe solicitors for the Defendant replied confirming the settlement\nincluding the provision that if the settlement payments were not\npaid as provided for, the Defendant would “forthwith become liable\nfor all amounts not so paid and your client may enforce such obligation\nagainst him.” It is clear and beyond dispute that the parties had taken\nindependent legal advice by 5 February 2013. Indeed, the Defendant, in\nhis first affidavit, makes express reference to the fact that he\nhad given certain instructions on the settlement agreement to his\nsolicitors. This suggests strongly that he had the benefit of legal\ncounsel earlier and certainly by around the 1 February 2013. 76     Aside\nfrom having the benefit of legal counsel, there is no doubt that the\nDefendant had partly performed the Settlement Agreement by causing the\ntransfer of the Firstlink Shares to the Plaintiff in performance\nof one of his obligations under the Settlement Agreement. Even though\nthe transfer was late (occurring on 28 February 2013), the Plaintiff\npoints out that at the time when the share transfer forms were delivered,\nthere was no indication that this transfer was to meet obligations\nowed by friends of the Defendant.[note: 21]Indeed there is no\nevidence that the transfer was made under any form of protest. There\nis also no dispute that the Plaintiff performed his obligation under\nthe Settlement Agreement by discontinuing the First Action. 77     The\ncash payments under the Settlement Agreement were due by 28 February\n2013 and 31 March 2013. Both of these were not made. Letters of demand\nwere sent by the solicitors for the Plaintiff to the Defendant on\n5March 2013 and 10 April 2013.[note: 22] 78     On\n17 April 2013, the solicitors for the Defendant replied to the letter of\ndemand of 10 April 2013 as follows:[note: 23] … 2.    We\nare instructed that our client cannot understand why your client insists\non threatening legal action. We are instructed that fundamental\nto the settlement of Suit 733/2012/J was the understanding that\nour client would be transferring the sum of $330,000 to your client\nonce he had collected the same from all the other parties indebted\nto your client. The circumstances of such indebtedness by such third\nparties have been expressed lucidly in the discontinued Suit 733/2012/J.\nYou will agree that no other person was named or made a party to\nthe settlement agreement executed upon the discontinuance of the\naforesaid Suit as they were never parties to the action in the first\nplace. 3.    We are further instructed that despite\nour client’s best efforts, these monies have yet to be collected\nfor onward transmission to your client, the current predicament\nof which has already been made known to your client. Our client\ninstructs that these other parties have indicated that they will\nbe abl e to settle their indebtedness within the next sixty (60)\ndays. … 79     In\nthe Plaintiff’s Affidavit in Reply dated 12 August 2013 (“LYK RA”), the\nexistence of an informal oral agreement was denied. Points raised\nby the Plaintiff (aside from the fact that the Settlement Agreement\nwas voluntarily entered into by the Defendant with assistance of\nlegal advice) include the observation that the Defendant provided\nfew details to substantiate or provide credence to the allegation\nthat the debts were those of friends who had gambled with the Plaintiff’s\nchips. The identity of the friends from whom the Defendant was supposed\nto attempt recovery of the debts was not revealed until the Defendant\nfiled his reply affidavit on 24 July 2013 resisting Sum 3506 (“TVL-AF”).\nEven then only one person was named. The other friend was simply\ndescribed as a “female friend.” The explanation for the Defendant’s\nreticence was that he was concerned that if he named the female\nfriend that this would “sour” his relationship with her as well\nas worsen his relationship with the Plaintiff.[note: 24]The\nDefendant also states that he does not name these friends as he\ndid not want to “drag them into the mud of litigation.”[note: 25]Up\nto a certain point, the Defendant’s apparent reticence to name the\nthird party friends is perhaps somewhat understandable. The failure\nto provide details does not necessarily force the conclusion that\nthe oral understanding was a fabrication. Nevertheless, this court\nis bound to note that by 5 February 2013, the Plaintiff and Defendant were\nin the midst of a serious dispute and that the Defendant must have been\naware of the implications of the Settlement Agreement (taken on\nat face value). Given the terms of the Settlement Agreement and\nthe history of the dispute (from the perspective of the Defendant),\nthe importance of the alleged oral understanding is obvious. It\nis for this reason that the absence of details and supporting evidence\nfor the oral understanding and the debts of the friends is a cause\nfor some concern.  Indeed, the Plaintiff’s solicitors, by letter\ndated 18 April 2013 (in reply to the Defendant’s solicitor letter\nof 17 April 2013), denied the allegation that there was some sort\nof understanding and noted that no particulars had been provided\nas to who these other parties were who were alleged indebted to\nthe Plaintiff. 80     In\nLYK RA, the Plaintiff exhibited and made reference to a number of SMS\nmessages exchanged between himself and the Defendant. The point that\nthe Plaintiff sought to make was that nowhere in these messages\nis there any reference or suggestion that an oral understanding\nexisted whereby the Defendant was to recover the debts from third\nparty friends and to hand the same over to the Plaintiff. The SMS\nmessages referred to were dated 21 January 2013, 28 February 2013,\n1, 4 and 5 March 2013. Whilst the exhibited messages offer some\nsupport for the Plaintiff’s position, this court is bound to note\nthat only portions of the messages appear to be exhibited and there\nis no telling as to whether there are other SMS messages or emailsetcwhich may be relevant. 81     In\nhis grounds of decision, the AR’s view was that there was simply\nno evidence to support the existence of the oral agreement which\nwould allow the AR to place any weight on the assertion for the\npurposes of the application for summary judgment. The AR’s comment\nthat the Defendant had only made a “bare assertion” that there was\nsome oral agreement is justified even if the court disregards the\nexhibited SMS chain of messages referred to above. 82     The\nconclusion that this court has come to is that the Defendant did freely\nenter into the Settlement Agreement of 1 February 2013 and as referred\nto in the exchange of letters dated 5 February 2013. There is no evidence\nto support the Defendant’s assertion that the Settlement Agreement\nwas subject to or governed by an unrecorded/undocumented oral contract\nor understanding. Even if there was some evidence of an oral understanding,\nthe parol evidence rule would have to be considered. The alleged\noral understanding is clearly inconsistent with the written terms\nof the Settlement Agreement. To be clear, this court is not deciding\nthis appeal simply on the basis of the parol evidence rule. Instead,\nthe decision is based on the view that the existence of the Settlement\nAgreement has been firmly established and that there is no basis\nfor doubting its terms and obligations and subjecting performance\nto some informal, oral understanding which fundamentally alters\nwhat was expressly provided and for which there is no supporting\nevidence. 83     It\nfollows that I am not satisfied that the Defendant has shown that leave\nto defend (unconditional or otherwise) should be granted on the\nbasis of the alleged oral understanding or agreement referred to\nabove. Instead, much will depend on whether the Defendant has demonstrated\nsome other basis for attacking the Settlement Agreement. That basis\nis said to be based on the gaming/moneylending issues which arose\nin connection with the First Suit and which the Defendant now seeks\nto rely on so as to impugn the enforceability of the Settlement\nAgreement. I now turn to discuss this argument. 84     Taking\nthe Defendant’s pleaded case at its highest, the defence raised in\nthe First Suit turned on the broad allegation that the Plaintiff\nhad been running an unlicensed junket operation at Marina Bay Sands\nand thereby came within the ambit of the MLA and CLA. The debt/loan\nwhich the Plaintiff was claiming in the First Suit was said to have\n“arisen” out these gaming activities such that even if the Defendant\nowed the money, the claim was unenforceable. The Plaintiff asserts\nthat the money owed derived from a debt which the Defendant owed\nto Foo and which had been paid by the Plaintiff on behalf of the\nDefendant. The Plaintiff denies that there is any connection between\nthis and the alleged illicit junket operation. The positions taken\nby the parties in the First Suit are sharply conflicting. If the Defendant\nhad succeeded at trial in showing that the monies were gambling debts\narising in the course of an illicit junket operation, relying on\nthe case law discussed earlier, this would have assisted the Defendant\nin trying to establish a defence at law. This court is not holding\nthat on the basis of what was pleaded and asserted by the Defendant\nin the First Suit, the unlicensed moneylending defence would have\nsucceeded as a matter of law if the First Suit had gone to trial.\nThe key point is that at the time the First Suit was settled, it\nwasfar from clearas to whose version\nof events would be established at trial. Even if the Plaintiff was\ninvolved in some form of junket scheme, it was not clear as to what\nthe connection was between the Defendant, Foo and the junket operation.\nIn short, the First Suit was settled at a point when there was a\nserious dispute as to whether the claim related to moneylending,\njunket operations and gaming losses. The fact that a claim for summary\njudgment in the First Suit was unlikely to succeed does not mean\nthat the Plaintiff’s claim or version of the events was flawed or inherently\nunbelievable. Indeed, the court is reminded that the Defendant did\nnot in the First Suit take out an application for striking out.\nThe fact that the Plaintiff agreed to settle the First Suit does\nnot mean that the Plaintiff thereby admitted all the allegations\nand points of defence which were raised in the First Suit. It is\nalso noted that the First Suit was for the sum of $730,000. The\nSettlement Agreement reached was for thefullamount\nof the claim. What the Defendant had secured was agreement that the\nclaim would be satisfied by means of a transfer of shares and two instalment\npayments of cash. 85     To\nbe clear, if the First Suit was indeed a claim for recovery of sums owed\nby the Defendant in respect of gaming losses arising out of the\njunket operation (meaning that if this was admitted by the Plaintiff\nor if the evidence was clear beyond doubt), this court accepts that\nthe Defendant may well have enjoyed the defence that he had asserted.\nIf inthesecircumstances, the Plaintiff\nhad entered into a Settlement Agreement, an arguable case might\nhave been made that the Settlement Agreement was not “absolute”\nand that the same public policy objections to the First Suit carried\nthrough and tainted the Second Suit. The point, however, is these are\nnot the circumstances in which the First Suit was settled. The Plaintiff has\nnever admitted that the claim was in respect of gaming losses and\nwould no doubt have disputed the applicability of the MLA and CLA\nif the case had gone to trial. 86     The\ncourt reminds itself of the decision of the English Court of Appeal\ninBinderreferred to earlier. \nIt will be recalled that in that case, Lord Denning MR found that\nthe dispute as to whether the lender was a moneylender had already\nformed the subject matter of abona fidecompromise\nagreement. It followed that the dispute could not be reopened unless\nthe lender had taken “unfair advantage” of the borrower.  It also follows\nthat there is huge difference between a settlement reached when there\nis a genuine dispute as to whether the lender is a moneylender and\na case where the settlement agreement accepts or is founded on established unlicensed\nmoneylending. In the same case, Phillimore LJ (at 159) commented: It is said that this court ought to look\nbehind the terms drawn up to represent the agreement between the\nparties – an agreement freely negotiated and signed by all concerned.\n[Counsel] says that there are matters which cast an aroma of moneylending\nover the whole of these transactions … Speaking for myself, I think\nit is entirely plain that this was a bona fide compromise and that\nthere is nothing in evidence here which could make this court saywith any confidencethat these were moneylending\ntransactions, illegal transactions … The terms of the agreement\nare not to be described as colorable. The court ought to be very\nslow to look behind an agreement reached in circumstances as these…”\n[emphasis in italics added] 87     In\na similar vein, the remarks of Roskill LJ inBinderat\n160 are worth repeating: In my judgment it is the law of this country,\nas Lord Denning MR has said, where there is a bona fide compromise\nof an existing dispute and that compromise includes a compromise\nof what … is basically an issue of fact, namely whether or not there\nhad been unlawful moneylending, especially where the compromise\nhas been reached under the advice of counsel and solicitors, that\nthat compromise is enforceable against the party seeking to repudiate\nit. Any other course would cause very great difficulty in the administration\nof justice. One example will suffice: subject to the sanction of the\nCourt, a liquidator is entitled to compromise a dispute with debtors… What\nis he supposed to do if he is met by the defence that the debt or supposed\ndebt arose from unlawful moneylending? Must he refuse to compromise?\nWhat is the court to do? Must the court refuse to sanction a compromise\nbecause it can always be reopened later … In such a case it seems\nto me clear that the court should encourage and when appropriate enforce\nany bona fide compromise arrived at, especially one arrived at under legal\nadvice. 88     Returning\nbriefly to the decision of Andrew Ang J inReal\nEstate Consortium, it will be recalled that the learned\njudge accepted that a compromise agreement was not an absolute bar\nto reopening of issues. That said, the Court rightly stressed that\nthere was onlylimitedscope for\nthe court to determine whether the terms of the compromise were\nfair and reasonable. Examples given were cases where the prior issues\nwere tainted by illegality, fraud, duress, undue influence or mistake.\n It follows that where the suit that was settled/compromised wasclearlytainted by illegality, the settlement\nagreement might itself be affected by the illegality. The position\nis different, however, where there is agenuine\ndisputeas to whether there is moneylending or gaming\nor some illegality that affects the original claim. When there is\nagenuine disputeas to whether\nan illegality defence might have applied in the previous case, then,\nthere may be a greater argument that any settlement between the\nparties would be a trulybona fideone\nbecause of parties’ differing legal positions. 89     I\npause now to take stock and emphasise the principles of law, and propose\na suitable framework to analyse them in. Drawing from the cases\nI have discussed above, I find that these principles are helpful\nin deciding whether or not a party should be allowed to impugn a\nsettlement agreement: (a)     Where\nparties have agreed to resolve their dispute amicably by way of\na validly formed settlement agreement, the settlement agreementalonegoverns the parties' legal relationship\nin the absence of the above vitiating factors (applyingReal Estate Consortium); (b)     Because\nthe settlement agreementalonegoverns\nthe parties’ legal relationship,prima facie,\nparties should not be allowed to rely on anything outside of this\nlegal relationship in attempting to impugn the settlement agreement.\nThis would mean any disputed legal issues (supposedly settled) would\nhave no, or at the most little, bearing on the legality or formation\nof the settlement agreement. (c)     A\nsettlement agreement is ultimately premised on the law of contract.\nThere is alimitedscope for the\ncourt to determine whether the terms of the compromise are fair\nand reasonable in deciding whether the settlement agreement should\nnot be enforced. This limited scope includes grounds by which normal\ncontracts are usually challenged, such as because of duress, illegalityetc. (d)     Therefore,\na party arguing to set aside or challenge the settlement agreement\nmust satisfy the court that such grounds exist, before the settlement\nagreement will be set aside. 90     To\naddress the issue raised in this case directly, whether or not the Defendant\ncan “rely” on the illegality defence raised in the First Suit, is therefore\nsomewhat of a misleading question. Because the Settlement Agreement\nnow purely governs the legal relationship between the parties, technically,\nthe Defendant is not allowed to “re-open” the issues raised in the\nFirst Suit. However, since the facts leading to any alleged illegality would,\nin most cases, be essentially the same set of facts leading to the\nlegal issues raised in the First Suit, the court must look at those\nset of facts (as alleged and contested) to determine whether or\nnot the Settlement Agreement is ultimately tainted by illegality.\nThe burden of proof, therefore, must still lie with the party resisting\nthe enforcement of a settlement agreement, in showing how the settlement\nagreement was premised on circumstances which would afford him the\ndefence of illegality, such that the court will not enforce the\nsettlement agreement. In this way, there is no “white-washing” of\nany illegality as the court must still look at what will be most\nof the time the same set of facts. 91     Applying\nthese principles to the case at hand, given the Settlement Agreement\nbetween the parties, it willprimafacie\ngovern the legal relationship between the parties. The question\nthat lies before the court is whether the Defendant has shown that\nthe Settlement Agreement was premised on illegal circumstances,\nor that the Plaintiff has taken an “unfair advantage” such that\nthe Settlement Agreement should not be enforced. As to the point\nof illegality, all the Defendant has done is to rely on essentially the\nsame facts and arguments which were in issue and dispute and raised\nin the First Suit, and nothing more. The conclusion that this court\nhas come to is that there was a real dispute as to whether the claim\nwas essentially for gaming debts and so caught by the MLA and CLA.\n These are the circumstances in which the Settlement Agreement was\nentered into, and based on the arguments and the evidence before\nme alone, I am not satisfied that the Defendant has shown that the\nSettlement Agreement was tainted by illegality. 92     Since\nthe Defendant has failed to show how the Settlement Agreement is\ntainted by illegality, it remains for this court to investigate whether\nthe Plaintiff had in some way taken “unfair advantage” of the Defendant\n(applyingReal Estate Consortium).\nFactors which I have taken note of in reaching my decision on this\ninclude the following: (a)     That\nthe Defendant accepts that he had voluntarily entered into the Settlement\nAgreement (see TVL-AF at [54] where the Defendant states that he\nvoluntarily signed the Settlement Agreement but adds that the agreement\nwas primarily premised on an illegal gaming debt). (b)     That\nthe language and meaning of the wording of the Settlement Agreement\nis clear. (c)     That\nthe Defendant had the benefit of legal counsel. At the very least,\nwhen the letters were exchanged by the parties solicitors on 5 February\n2013 there can be no doubt that the Defendant had engaged counsel\non the matter. (d)     That\nthe Defendant had in a sense partly performed the Settlement Agreement\nby transferring the Firstlink shares (albeit late). (e)     That\nthe Plaintiff did perform his side of the agreement by discontinuing\nthe First Suit. 93     I\nalso take into consideration the AR’s comments in granting the Defendant\nconditional leave to defend, where he described the defence of unlicensed\nmoneylending as being “shadowy” in nature. If by this the AR was\nreferring to the First Suit, it must follow that the Plaintiff would\nhave been entitled to settle the First Suit on the terms as set\nout in the Settlement Agreement. Indeed, it is noted that the AR\nwent on to state that he granted conditional leave because the evidence\nembodied in the acknowledgment note and cheque image fell just short\nof what was required to rebut the assertion of unlicensed moneylending.\nThe AR may well be justified in taking this view. Nevertheless,\nthe point remains that there was at the very least a genuine dispute\nin the First Suit as to whether there was unlicensed moneylending\nthat affected the Plaintiff’s claim. The “shadowy” nature of the\ndefence in the First Suit provides the context for what appears\nto be a legitimate settlement agreement. 94     Given\nthe points I have observed and the context behind the Settlement\nAgreement, there is no basis for an argument that the Defendant has\nbeen unfairly taken advantage of in coming to the Settlement Agreement.\nAs inReal Estate Consortium, there\nis no evidence that the Plaintiff subjected the Defendant to any\nform of economic duress and that, on the facts, it is clear that\nthe Defendant could have chosen to defend the First Suit by trying\nto establish his allegations of gaming, junket operations and moneylending.\nWhether he would have succeeded is speculative. What is not speculative\nis that the Defendant entered into the Settlement Agreement knowing\nfull well what the written terms meant. 95     That\nbeing so, the Plaintiff is entitled to summary judgment since there\nis no reason to conclude that the Settlement Agreement was tainted by\nillegality, unfair or unconscionable.",
        "Conclusion": "96     For\nthe sake of completeness, it is noted that in the Second Suit, the Defendant\nby Summons No 4218 of 2013 applied to strike out the Plaintiff’s claim\nfor non-satisfaction of the Settlement Agreement. The AR heard the striking\nout summons together with the application for summary judgment.\nThe application to strike out was dismissed and the Defendant was\ngranted conditional leave to defend. There was no appeal against\nthe dismissal of the striking out application. On the question of\ncosts, the Plaintiff in the written submissions sought an award\nof costs on a full indemnity basis. This was because the Defendant\nhad attempted to raise irrelevant considerations in challenging\nthe validity of the Settlement Agreement. These considerations were\nsaid to be the issues on unlicensed moneylending as well as the\nattempt to impugn the written agreement by means of the alleged\noral understanding.  Whilst I have allowed the appeal, I do not\nagree that this is an appropriate case for the award of indemnity costs\nand decline to exercise the discretion to award costs on that basis. 97     It\nfollows that the appeal is allowed. Summary judgment in the sum\nof $330,000 is awarded to the Plaintiff together with interest and\ncosts, to be agreed on or taxed.
