        "Facts": "",
        "The parties": "2 The Appellant is WGE (“theWife”). 3 The Respondent is WGF (“theHusband”). 4 The Wife and Husband were married on 26 September 2010 and have one child to the marriage (“D”), who is seven years old this year.1Foot Note 1×ROA vol.1 at p39 Para 2.",
        "Background to the dispute": "5 The Wife commenced divorce proceedings on 22 January 2021 against the Husband on the basis that the Husband had behaved in such a way that she could not reasonably be expected to live with him. The interim judgment was granted on 24 March 2021 on an uncontested basis.2Foot Note 2×ROA vol.1 p39 Para 3.This was a marriage of around ten years and four months.3Foot Note 3×ROA vol.1 p39 Para 4. 6 The parties resolved the child-related issues by way of a consent order dated 6 August 2021. The remaining contested issues are the ancillary issues relating to the division of matrimonial assets, and maintenance for the Wife and child.4Foot Note 4×ROA vol.1 p40 Para 6.",
        "Decision below": "195 In arriving at the figure of S$1,732 for the child’s monthly expenses, the DJ excluded those items of the child’s expenses which the Husband would already be directly reimbursing (eg,school fees, medical and dental fees, etc.).196Foot Note 196×ROA vol.1 at p81-83 Paras 114-115.The DJ also noted that since the Wife was gainfully employed, she should contribute to the maintenance of the child.197Foot Note 197×ROA vol.1 p84 Para 117.The DJ estimated the ratio of the Husband’s income to the Wife’s – taking care to include dividends from the Husband’s shareholdings, assets from the division of matrimonial assets and assets out of the matrimonial pool – before concluding that it would be fair for the Husband to pay 90% of the child’s monthly expenses, with the Wife paying the remaining 10%.198Foot Note 198×ROA vol.1 p84-85 Paras 118-119.",
        "The parties’ cases on appeal": "",
        "Wife’s Case": "196 On appeal, the Wife argued that based on the current maintenance award and her existing salary, she would have no savings; and paying for 10% of the Child Maintenance would eat even further into her already limited financial resources.199Foot Note 199×Appellant’s Case at Para 87(a).She argued that the Husband, on the other hand, was in a far superior financial position – and that her contributions to the marriage were at least partially responsible for his having attained such a position.200Foot Note 200×Appellant’s Case at Para 87(b).With his high income (about S$25,000 per month, including his dividends), he was well able to afford the additional 10% or S$172201Foot Note 201×Appellant’s Case at Para 87(c).; and he should therefore be ordered to bear 100% of the Child Maintenance. 197 It should be noted that on appeal, the Wife suggested that she was prepared to abandon this aspect of the appeal if her lump sum maintenance were to be increased to the amount she was seeking.202Foot Note 202×Appellant’s Case at Para 87.In oral submissions, it was also argued on behalf of the Wife that the issue of accommodation expenses would shade into the issue of maintenance for the child as well, as the Husband should contribute towards providing accommodation for the child as well.203Foot Note 203×Transcript of 27 March at p 29 ln 10 to ln 28.",
        "Husband’s Case": "198 The Husband, on the other hand, submitted that pursuant to the CA’s decision inAUA v ATZ[2016] 4 SLR 674 (“AUA v ATZ”), it was clear that both parents had a duty to provide for their children, although their precise obligations might differ depending on their means and capabilities.204Foot Note 204×Respondent’s Case at Para 143.The Husband also argued that it was wrong for the Wife to justify her position on the Child Maintenance Issue by reference to her own alleged needs and contributions to the marriage instead of the son’s reasonable needs and expenses.205Foot Note 205×Respondent’s Case at Para 142.",
        "Issues on Appeal": "20 The following issues arose for my determination in the hearing of this appeal: (a) Whether the DJ erred in finding that only 557 (and not all 939,657) of the Husband’s KS shares were matrimonial assets (“the KS Shares Issue”). (b) Whether the DJ erred in valuing the Husband’s 210,000 MS shares at S$466,561.24 (“theMS Shares Issue”). (c) Whether the DJ erred in assessing parties’ indirect contributions in the ratio of 52:48 in the Wife’s favour (“the Indirect Contributions Issue”). (d) Whether the DJ erred in awarding the Wife lump sum maintenance of S$33,600 (“the Maintenance Issue”). (e) Whether the DJ erred in awarding S$1,732 for D’s monthly expenses and in ordering the Husband to bear 90% thereof instead of 100% (“the Child Maintenance Issue”). 21 In the paragraphs that follow, I address these issuesseriatim. 22 For the record, the Wife has indicated that she has abandoned her appeals in respect of the following other aspects of the DJ’s decision:26Foot Note 26×Appellant’s Case at Para 3. (a) The exclusion from the matrimonial pool of three of the Husband’s accounts in Netherlands; and (b) The refusal to backdate the Wife’s maintenance.",
        "Basis for review by an appellate court of a trial judge’s decision": "23 By way of general principle, it is trite that appellate intervention in respect of findings of fact made by a trial judge is warranted only when the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or manifestly against the weight of the evidence (Nambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd and another appeal[2022] 1 SLR 391at [8];Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd vOrix Leasing Singapore Ltd[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 (“Tat Seng”)at [41];TuitiongeniusPte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another[2021] 1 SLR 231 at [19];Simpson Marine (SEA) Pte Ltd vJiacipto Jiaravanon[2019] 1 SLR 696 at [59];North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Yip Fook Meng[2022] 1 SLR 677 at [21]). The rationale for this is that the trial judge is generally in a better place to assess the credibility of witnesses, especially in situations where oral evidence is concerned. InTat Seng, the Court of Appeal (“CA”) (at [41]) further clarified that where a finding of fact is not based on the veracity or credibility of the witness, but is instead based on an inference drawn from the facts or evaluation of the facts, the appellate court would be in as good a position as the trial judge to make findings of fact. This would involve the appellate court evaluating the cogency of the evidence from the witnesses by testing it against inherent probabilities or uncontroverted facts. 24 In respect of errors of law, the CA inNg Eng Ghee and others v MamataKapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 at [90] has listed various types of errors of law (citingHalsbury’s Laws of Englandvol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) at [70]; see alsoMu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata Plan No 1849[2021] 5 SLR 1401 at [34]): Errors of law include misinterpretation of a statute or any other legal document or a rule of common law; asking oneself and answering the wrong question,taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into accountwhen purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence orrejecting admissible and relevant evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles; giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoning or which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, and misdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof.

        "Issue 1: Whether the DJ erred in finding that only 557 (instead of all 939,657) of the Husband’s KS shares are matrimonial assets": "25 Bearing these general principles in mind, I first address the KS Shares Issue.",
        "My Decision": "199 Insofar as the Wife has argued for the Husband to be liable for 100% of the Child Maintenance, I find her arguments to be without merit. As the Husband has pointed out, both parents are equally responsible for providing for their children, although their precise obligations may differ depending on their means and capacities (AUA v ATZat [41]). The Husband’s contribution towards the son’s maintenance has already been set at a very high rate – 90% of the assessed maintenance amount, versus the Wife’s 10%. In my view, this difference in the parties’ respective contributions to their son’s maintenance sufficiently accounts for the difference in their earning power. I would also highlight that in addition to being responsible for 90% of the assessed Child Maintenance amount, the Husband is required to make full and direct payment for D's school fees, medical expenses, dental expenses and current insurance policies.206Foot Note 206×ROA vol.1 at p 84-85.The Wife is not responsible for any of these expenses. 200 I have disregarded the Wife’s suggestion that she would be prepared to abandon this aspect of her appeal if her lump sum maintenance were increased, as the suggestion appears to me to be unprincipled and without merit. 201 In the circumstances, I see no reason to interfere with the DJ’s decision to award S$1,372 for D’s maintenance. 202 For completeness, I note that the Wife’s submission on accommodation expenses has already been dealt with by me earlier (at [191] - [193] above).",
        "Issue 2: Whether the DJ erred in valuing the Husband’s 210,000 MS shares at S$466,561.24": "44 I next address the MS Shares Issue.",
        "Whether MS’s FY 2021 financial statements should have been taken into consideration by the DJ in valuing the Husband’s shares": "53 In respect of the MS Shares Issue, the first question which arose on appeal was whether the company’s FY 2021 financial statements should have been taken into consideration by the DJ in valuing the shares. Although the FY 2021 financial statements had become available by the time of the AM hearing, the DJ apparently chose not to direct the experts to consider these FY 2021 financial statements and / or to file further reports to explain the impact of the information therein (if any) on their respective valuations. The DJ did not record his reasons for leaving the FY 2021 financial statements out of the equation, but in his grounds of decision, he alluded (at [60]) to the Wife’s expert Mr Wan having stated in his reply affidavit that he “[would] not be amending the original position about the market value of MS… even where the new partnerships the company [had] with companies such as KBC and Schlumberger were taken into account”.62Foot Note 62×ROA vol.1 at p60 Para 60.I infer from these remarks that the DJ thought that it was unnecessary to have regard to the FY 2021 financial statements if Mr Wan had not changed the opinion expressed in his first expert report even after becoming aware of some new information. 54 With respect, the DJ was in my view wrong to disregard the FY 2021 financial statements in valuing the shares. Insofar as Mr Wan had stated in his reply affidavit that he “[would] not be amending the original position about the market value of MS… even where the new partnerships the company [had] with companies such as KBC and Schlumberger were taken into account”, it must be pointed out that this reply affidavit was filed on 10 June 2022 without Mr Wan having had sight of the FY 2021 financial statements.63Foot Note 63×Appellant’s Case Para 53; ROA vol.5 at p 534.These financial statements were only made available in August 2022. Indeed, Mr Wan had expressly highlighted in his reply affidavit that his opinion in both his 1st and 2nd expert reports was formed on the basis of financial information as at 31 December 2020; and that “apart from some new partnership announcements”, he had “not been provided with [nor was he] able to find any significant changes in business circumstances that affected [MS]” between 24 March 2021 and 31 March 2022.64Foot Note 64×ROA vol.5 p547. 55 Given the above caveats to his valuation, it is clear that Mr Wan’s valuation of the MS shares was hampered by the lack of financial information from the most recent financial year. Indeed, since he had used the income approach for his valuation (as part of his hybrid approach), I accepted that the lack of the most recent financial information would have had a material impact on his valuation. Thus, for example, the much higher figure of30.8%growth provided in the FY 2021 financial report indicated that Mr Wan’s original estimate of15%growth in FY 2021 had severely underestimated MS’s profits for FY 2021.65Foot Note 65×Appellant’s Case at Para 54.The significantly higher actual figures in 2021 would also have had a further knock-on effect on Mr Wan’s projections for all subsequent years, since the trajectory of profit growth would necessarily steepen.66Foot Note 66×Appellant’s Case at Para 55. 56 With respect therefore, the DJ was wrong to have considered neither the FY 2021 financial statements, nor any expert reports that had considered the FY 2021 financial statements. In my view, a fair and accurate estimation of the value of the MS shares would be possible only if the FY 2021 financial statements were also taken into consideration. I therefore gave directions for the tendering of further expert reports from the two experts and further submissions from counsel on the MS Shares Issue. 57 I next summarise the further expert reports from Mr Wan and Mr Mann, as well as the parties’ further submissions.",
        "Wife’s further expert report": "58 In his further expert report, Mr Wan maintained 31 March 2022 as the operative date for the valuation of the MS shares.67Foot Note 67×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 29. 59 In his further report, Mr Wan elected to use only the income approach to value the MS shares. This, he explained, was because MS was in a very niche segment providing services to the oil and gas industry, and there was limited information on comparable companies.68Foot Note 68×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 18-19.He also clarified that the income approach adopted in the further report was substantially similar to the methodology adopted in his first report – save for some parameters which he had updated.69Foot Note 69×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 25.Given the assumptions made about the parameters of the company (including revenue projections, predicted gross-profit margins, predicted operating expenses, predicted capital expenditure and predicted taxes), he explained that it was highly unlikely that there would be a material difference between a valuation conducted as at 31 March 2022 (the valuation date he had adopted) and a valuation conducted as at 17 August 2022 (the date of the AM hearing).70Foot Note 70×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 26. 60 In applying the income approach in the further report, Mr Wan emphasised that it was important to add back excess cash into the valuation of the company. In 2021, MS had seen its cash holdings increase significantly – by about 58% – to US$1,175,755, even after taking into account the US$430,476 paid out in dividends. Based on historical data, a cash balance of US$1,175,755 was beyond the operating needs of the company; and from the FY 2021 financial statements, all the expenses of the company amounted to only US$869,857.71Foot Note 71×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 23.After accounting for the expenses of the company, Mr Wan calculated the excess cash left in the company (as of 31 March 2022) to be US$754,572.72Foot Note 72×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 23. 61 Using the income approach, Mr Wan estimated the value of MS to be US$4,990,110 (inclusive of the excess cash of US$754,572), with a pre-excess cash value of US$4,235,538. Mr Wan explained that this pre-excess cash value of US$4,235,538 was 21.8% higher than the figure of US$3,477,876 derived under the income approach in his first report, because more reliable and up-to-date information had resulted in a much higher starting base and a “revised size premium discount”.73Foot Note 73×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 28. 62 Applying a DLOM of 30%, a DLOC of 25%, and a USD/SGD exchange rate of 1:1.3548, Mr Wan arrived at a valuation ofS$824,506 forthe Husband’s 23.23% shareholding (210,000 shares)– as compared to the valuation of S$574,642 which had been derived using the income approach in his first report (now also including a DLOM of 30% and a DLOC of 25% to the previous figure).74Foot Note 74×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 29. 63 Mr Wan further explained that this valuation of S$824,506 translated to a value of aroundUS$2.90 per share– which was consistent with other independent measures. In this connection, he noted that a value of US$2.90 per share represented a 20.8% increase in the value of the shares – which was reasonably conservative given the considerably higher 45.5% increase in revenue since 2018, and the even higher 66.3% increase in profit since 2018. The value of US$2.90 per share was also reasonably conservative when comparison was drawn with a 2018 transaction wherein the Husband had purchased 19,000 shares from another shareholder at US$2.40 per share. In Mr Wan’s view, a private sale of a minority lot of shares at US$2.40 per share has already accounted for DLOM and DLOC in its sale price – and this made it a suitable base for independent comparison.75Foot Note 75×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 30. 64 In his further report, Mr Wan did not use the market approach as he did not find it suitable. He reasoned that the most recent transaction where the Husband bought shares from another shareholder had taken place in 2018 – and that since this transaction in 2018, the company has experienced rapid growth.76Foot Note 76×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 19.No details were available in respect of a more recent transaction in July 2021, wherein one of the directors, Mr H, had appeared to no longer be a shareholder of MS.77Foot Note 77×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 19.More specifically, Mr Wan opined that the previous transactions were no longer relevant, as the FY 2021 financial statements showed revenue to have grown by 45% and profits to be up by 66% since the year of the previous transactions.78Foot Note 78×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 24. 65 As with his first report, Mr Wan also ruled out using the cost approach. He pointed out that MS was a software company; and that the plant and equipment listed in its financial statements as of 31 December 2021 amounted to only US$4,821 in value. The cost approach did not accord any value to the software which helped MS to generate further revenue.  Such an approach thus failed to capture the true worth of the company. Most pertinently, the books of MS had written off all the software development cost even though the software was the company’s main income-generating asset.79Foot Note 79×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 19. 66 In Mr Wan’s view, a DLOC of 25% was suitable in the case of the MS shares because while the Husband was a director of the company and held a significant number of shares, he was not a majority shareholder, and there were three other directors. In other words, there were limitations to his ability to exercise control over the company. On the other hand, he was not in a situation where he found himself a non-family member in a family-run company, where he held a very small stake with no role at all except as a shareholder. In the latter situation, the appropriate DLOC would be 50%.80Foot Note 80×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 19-20. 67 As for the DLOM, Mr Wan took the position that a DLOM of 30% would be reasonable to reflect the fact that MS was not a listed company and that its shares changed hands irregularly, with various restrictions on the sale of shares. Additionally, MS did not pay regular dividends; and its nature as a software company meant that its success in the longer term was uncertain given the risk of new technologies and competition emerging.81Foot Note 81×3rd Affidavit of Wan at p 19-20.",
        "Husband’s further expert report": "68 In his further report, Mr Mann maintained 24 March 2021 as the operative date for his valuation of the MS shares.82Foot Note 82×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 13. 69 Whereas in his first report Mr Mann had adopted the cost approach in valuing the shares, in the further report he opted for the hybrid approach used by the DJ in his grounds of decision (and by Mr Wan in his first report). 70 In respect of the income approach, Mr Mann adopted the same methodology as that used by Mr Wan in his first report, while factoring in the change to the figure for net profit after tax in FY 2021 in light of the FY 2021 financial statements. Mr Mann also chose to apply a 25% DLOC and a 50% DLOM – compared to the 30% DLOM applied by Mr Wan in his first report.83Foot Note 83×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 17.Although Mr Mann stated that he did not agree with the parameters used by Mr Wan (for the reasons set out in Mr Mann’s second report),84Foot Note 84×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 17; ROA vol.5 at p 421-429.he continued to use the parameters which Mr Wan had used in his first report. Applying a 25% DLOC and a 50% DLOM, Mr Mann valued the Husband’s shareholding atUS$344,689,or S$466,984.85Foot Note 85×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 17. 71 In respect of the market approach, Mr Mann took the position that the shares should be valued at US$2.40 per share. He justified this by reference to Mr Wan’s report which utilised the Husband’s 2018 purchase of 19,000 shares from another shareholder at US$2.40 per share.86Foot Note 86×ROA vol.5 at p 138.Reliance was also placed on the fact that 96,000 treasury shares had been retired at US$230,400 in each of the two years in 2018 and 2019.87Foot Note 87×ROA vol.5 at p 138, 145.Further, Mr Mann applied a 50% DLOM – as compared to the 30% DLOM applied by the DJ. This yielded a valuation figure ofS$256,057.20in respect of the Husband’s 210,000 shares.88Foot Note 88×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 16. 72 In applying a 50% DLOM to the valuation of the MS shares, as opposed to a 30% DLOM, Mr Mann opined that the higher 50% discount he used was justified by the following factors: MS shares were not publicly traded; there were onerous restrictions on share transfers (such as a shareholders’ agreement which required consent from the other shareholders before shares could be sold); the shares were unregistered shares; the close-knit relationship among the company’s owners / shareholders who had previously worked with each other (which might deter other buyers from wanting to enter the company); and a relatively minute and/or thin market for the block of shares in question.89Foot Note 89×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 11-12.Further, Mr Mann opined that MS’s business was extremely niche, since it was tied to specialised software applications relevant only to oil and gas producing companies – and used only for one specific discipline in the industry (ie,process engineering). In Mr Mann’s view, this would lead to an extremely thin or minute market for MS’s business.90Foot Note 90×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 11-12.. 73 Using the hybrid approach and taking the average of the valuation figures obtained under the income approach and the market approach, Mr Mann came up with a valuation figure ofS$361,520.50for the Husband’s 210,000 MS shares.91Foot Note 91×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 19. 74 Additionally, although the DJ had rejected the cost approach in the proceedings below, in his further report, Mr Mann sought to put forward an alternative valuation figure based on this approach. He acknowledged that MS’s main asset was its exploitation of the software application which it had purchased from a related party (KS) for a sum of S$200,000; that MS derived the bulk of its revenue from the sales of licenses pertaining to the use of this software application; and that the software application had been written down completely by FY 2017. He also acknowledged that it would be neither practical nor correct to ascribe a nil value to the software since MS continued to use and exploit this asset in generating increased revenues and increased profits for MS – even after FY 2017. As such, he ascribed a value of S$200,000 to the software application,ie,the purchase price which MS had paid KS for the software. The other assets of MS, in the form of plant, equipment and inventory, were also taken into consideration before he made adjustments to reinstate the value of MS’s software application using a figure of S$200,000 (at an exchange rate of approximately 1 USD to 1.349 SGD). This meant that pursuant to the cost approach, MS was valued at S$1,446,768. Mr Mann then applied a further 25% DLOC and 50% DLOM to this figure, which eventually translated to the Husband’s 210,000 shares being valued at approximately S$126,032.92Foot Note 92×3rd Affidavit of Mann at p 13-15.",
        "Issue 3: Whether the DJ erred in assessing parties’ indirect contributions in the ratio of 52:48 in the Wife’s favour": "138 I next address the the Indirect Contributions Issue, where the Wife is appealing against the DJ’s decision to assess the parties’ indirect contributions in the ratio of 52:48 in her favour.",
        "Issue 4: Whether the DJ erred in awarding the Wife lump sum maintenance of S$33,600": "164 I next address the Maintenance Issue, in which the Wife has appealed against the DJ’s award of S$33,600 for lump sum maintenance as being too low.",
        "The Wife’s Case": "169 On appeal, the Wife argued that the multiplicand of S$700 was grossly insufficient as it would leave her with no savings for a rainy day. She therefore asked for the multiplicand to be increased by S$300.177Foot Note 177×Appellant’s Case at Paras 72-74.It was argued as well that the DJ should have allowed her claim of S$300 for monthly MCST charges, instead of the S$70 he awarded for this item. 170 Notwithstanding her claim for monthly MCST charges, the Wife argued that there was a possibility that she would not be able to afford to buy out the Husband’s share of the matrimonial home and that she would have to purchase a new home instead. According to the Wife, this meant that she should be awarded an additional lump sum maintenance of S$54,000 to cover 18 months’ rent (based on monthly rent of S$3,000). This was because she would need at least that length of time to purchase a new home, given the recent imposition of a 15-month wait-out period for current and former private homeowners seeking to buy non-subsidised HDB resale flats. 171 In oral submissions, it was further argued on behalf of the Wife that the amount she would receive from the distribution of matrimonial assets was significantly less than the S$890,000 figure alluded to by the DJ. For one, the Wife contended that the DJ must have included the lump sum maintenance of S$33,600 in the S$890,000 figure.178Foot Note 178×Transcript of 27 March at p 24 ln 29 to p 25 ln 12.The Wife argued that she should not be expected to utilise the S$33,600 allocated for maintenance to provide a roof over their son D’s head, given the great disparity between her income and the Husband’s income, and given that this sum was meant to cover her expenses (which did not include accommodation expenses).179Foot Note 179×Transcript of 27 March at p 25 ln 13 to ln 24.It was also contended that various sums should be deducted from the Wife’s share of matrimonial assets:eg,S$56,570 in the Wife’s CPF Special Account and S$49,703.22 in her MediSave account, the surrender value of her insurance policies, and legal fees. According to the Wife, after deducting these various sums and allowing for an amount of S$54,000 in total rental for an 18-month period, she would be left with a sum of only S$607,277.17, which would not be enough for her to acquire a residence similar to the condominium in which their son D had spent the first seven years of his life.180Foot Note 180×Transcript of 27 March at p 30 ln 4 to ln 9.Even if she and D were to reside in rented accommodation (on an assumed rental of S$3,000 per month), she would only be able to afford rental for about 15 years – at which point D would still be in tertiary education and thus still a dependent.181Foot Note 181×Transcript of 27 March at p 30 ln 10 to ln 19. 172 As to the multiplier, the Wife submitted that a multiplier of four years was grossly insufficient. Prior to her resignation from SIA in September 2015, she had been earning a monthly salary of S$5,000 after 15 years of service with SIA. Assuming a generous annual increment of 10% on her present salary of S$3,000, it would take her six years before she could reach a monthly figure of S$5,000. She had also been obliged to join a completely different industry when she started working again, because her age and the need to take care of D made it unsuitable for her to rejoin SIA.182Foot Note 182×Appellant’s Case at Para 81. 173 Insofar as she had seen her salary increase from S$2,200 to S$3,000 following a job switch, the Wife submitted that this should not be construed as a sign of her ability to increase her salary to meet her expenses. This was because according to her, the large increase was a one-off anomaly attributable to the fact that when she first rejoined the workforce, she had taken the first job available despite its low salary. While she had managed to land a better paid job on her own initiative, she argued against this being used as a barometer to gauge her future increments.183Foot Note 183×Appellant’s Case at Para 83. 174 Taking into account the above factors, the Wife submitted that a more appropriate multiplier would be six years.184Foot Note 184×Appellant’s Case at para 84.",
        "Issue 5: Whether the DJ erred in awarding S$1,732 for D’s monthly expenses  and in ordering the Husband to bear 90% thereof instead of 100%": "194 Finally, I address the Child Maintenance Issue. Here, the Wife contended that the S$1,732 which the DJ awarded for the child’s monthly expenses fell short of a reasonable maintenance amount, and that the Husband should have been ordered to bear the full amount of the child’s monthly expenses instead of only 90%.",
        "Conclusion": "203 In conclusion, I allow the Wife’s appeal in part as follows: (a) In relation to the MS Shares Issue, the value attributed to the Husband’s MS shares is increased to S$753,662.50. Accordingly, the total value of the pool of matrimonial assets is increased to S$2,960,599.71207Foot Note 207×ROA vol.1 at p 89-91.; (b) In relation to the Indirect Contributions Issue, the ratio of the parties’ indirect contributions is adjusted to 70:30 in the Wife’s favour. Taking into account the direct contributions ratio (which is now adjusted to 89:11 in favour of the Husband),208Foot Note 208×ROA vol.1 at p 66.the average and final ratio is 59.5:40.5 in favour of the Husband. As noted earlier (at [193]), counsel for both parties have agreed that the Wife’s entitlement to the matrimonial pool is accordingly increased to S$1,199,050.98. 204 The Wife’s appeal in respect of the KS Shares Issue, the Maintenance Issue and the Child Maintenance Issue is dismissed. 205 In respect of the matrimonial home, the DJ had in the AM hearing below given the Wife three months from the date of his decision in which to exercise her right of first refusal to purchase the Husband’s share of the matrimonial home. Given that the Wife has had some eight months since the filing of her notice of appeal to mull over this issue, I do not think another three months’ wait is necessary. As such, the Wife has 14 calendar days from the date of this judgment in which to notify the Husband in writing of any decision on her part to exercise her right of first refusal. If the Wife decides against buying out the Husband’s share of the property, then the Husband has 14 calendar days from the expiry of the deadline given to the Wife, in which to notify the Wife in writing of any decision on his part to buy out her share. If neither side wishes to take over the property, then it will be sold on the open market within seven months from the expiry of the above-mentioned 28 calendar days, with both the Husband and the Wife having joint conduct of the sale; net sale proceeds after settling outstanding mortgage loans (if any), CPF refunds (if any) and costs and expenses of sale to be divided in the final ratio I have determined. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event either the Wife or the Husband decides to buy over the other party’s share of the matrimonial home, the value of the matrimonial home as assessed by the DJ shall apply for the purpose of determining the amount to be paid by the Wife or the Husband, as the case may be. 206 As to the costs of the appeal, I am inclined to think that since the Wife has succeeded on the two most important issues in her appeal (in terms of the impact on the state of her finances), she should be awarded the costs of the appeal, but these costs should be adjusted to take into account the fact that she has failed on the remaining issues raised. I will hear parties before I make any order on costs. 207 Post division of matrimonial assets, based on the final ratio I have determined, the Wife should have in her name assets totalling a higher value than the aggregate amount to which she is entitled. I leave it to parties to work out the necessary computations. Parties may submit the draft order of court for my approval before extracting it. Both have liberty to apply in the event any clarification is required.
