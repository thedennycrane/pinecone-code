        "Discovery of documents relating to SMC’s revocation of the\n                1st DC and appointment of the 2nd DC": "8       The judicial review record, which comprises the\n                    Applicant’s statement in support, the Respondent’s affidavit in\n                    reply and the Applicant’s affidavits in response, together with all\n                    annexures, includes two material emails in which the members of the SMC first\n                    revoked the appointment of the 1st DC and subsequently appointed the\n                    2nd DC. The Applicant’s case on judicial review relating to bias or\n                    apprehension of bias is founded,inter alia, on\n                    the SMC Registrar and one witness and two 1st DC members being recipients\n                    of the two emails. The recipients of the two emails are all clearly identified\n                    and include the SMC Registrar and the 1st DC members and\n                witness. 9       It is pertinent to note that the content of\n                    these emails to all SMC members which evince the SMC’s decisions to first\n                    revoke the appointment of the 1st DC and subsequently to appoint the\n                    2nd DC are self-explanatory. The email dated 3 September 2010\n                    reads: 1.    We refer to the inquiry against Dr Lim Mey Lee\n                            Susan. 2.    At the hearing on 29 Jul 2010, the Defence\n                            Counsel made a procedural application for the Disciplinary Committee\n                            (DC) to recuse itself. Details of this case can be givenonlyat the conclusion of the inquiry and until\n                            then, we seek your kind understanding and patience on this\n                            matter. 3.    As the result of the DC having recused itself, it\n                            is now necessary for the Singapore Medical Council to revoke the\n                            appointment of the current DC hearing this inquiry and appoint a new DC\n                            pursuant to Section 42(5) of the Medical Registration Act,\n                        i.e. “The Medical Council may at any time revoke the\n                            appointment of any Disciplinary Committee or may remove any member of a\n                            Disciplinary Committee or fill any vacancy in a Disciplinary\n                            Committee.” 4.    The new DC will be appointed in due course and a\n                            separate email will be sent to you shortly. 5.    Council’s approval is sought on this\n                            administrative matter to revoke the current DC to allow SMC to move\n                            forward on this matter. 6.    We will take it that members have no objections if\n                            we do not hear from you byTuesday, 7 September\n                                2010. … [emphasis in original] 10     The second email dated 13 September 2010,\n                    sent by and to the same parties, reads: 1.    I refer to my email below [3 September 2010]\n                            where a new Disciplinary Committee (DC) has to be appointed for the\n                            inquiry for Dr Lim Mey Lee Susan. 2.    The DC proposed to hear the case [is] as\n                            follows: Proposed Members for DC – Dr Lim Mey Lee\n                            Susan:- Prof Tan Ser Kiat (Chairman) Prof C Rajasoorya Dr Abraham Kochitty A/Prof Koh Ming Choo Pearlie (Layperson) Mr Vinodh Coomaraswamy SC (Legal Assessor) 3.    All proposed DC members have declared that they\n                            have no conflict of interests and are agreeable to the appointment. In\n                            the meantime, we would be grateful that members do not discuss or\n                            mention this case (despite of what has been reported in the papers) so\n                            that the DC inquiry is not compromised. 4.    Members’ approval is sought for the\n                            appointment of the above DC. We will assume that members have no\n                            objections if we do not hear from you by5pm,\n                                Tuesday, 14 Sep 2010. … [emphasis in original] Both emails required no reply and the SMC confirmed that none was\n                    received by the due dates. 11     In short, the Applicant’s complaint that\n                    the Registrar and the two members and a witness of the 1st DC had received\n                    the emails is palpably evident in the record. It is also palpably evident on\n                    record that no express agreement was sought by the emails nor were any received\n                    by the due response dates from any member of the SMC. In the light of the above,\n                    the discovery application for all documents relating to the SMC’s action\n                    first in revoking the appointment of the 1st DC and second in appointing\n                    the 2nd DC is not necessary for disposing fairly of the Applicant’s\n                    case for judicial review on the record.",
        "Discovery of documents relating to SMC’s appointment of the\n                1st DC": "12     There is no correspondence, emails and minutes\n                    evidencing SMC’s appointment of the 1st DC and the discussions\n                    relating to the 1st DC’s appointment in the record. The Applicant\n                    concedes that there is no allegation of bias or apprehension of bias against the\n                    process by which the 1st DC was appointed. There is therefore, on the\n                    record, no question raised of any contemporaneous bias or apprehension of bias\n                    on the part of the SMC when it appointed the 1st DC. 13     It is only because of the Applicant’s\n                    challenge of the SMC’s appointment of the 2nd DC that the Applicant\n                    now seeks discovery of the documents relating to the appointment of the\n                    1st DC. The discovery application for these documents relating to the\n                    appointment of the 1st DC is remote to her challenge of the appointment of\n                    the 2nd DC. The subject matter of OS 1252/2010 relates to the\n                    2nd DC and all the core documents relating to the 2nd DC required for\n                    the Applicant to make her case are in the record. The heart of the 2nd DC\n                    appointment is in the record, these being the emails, reproduced above at[9]and[10], which are self-explanatory. The discovery application for\n                    these documents relating to the appointment of the 1st DC is again not\n                    necessary for disposing fairly of the Applicant’s case on the\n                    record.",
        "Discovery of papers relating to reg 42": "14     This discovery application seeks discovery of\n                    all minutes, papers and reports of the SMC in relation to the amendment of\n                    reg 42 and it being brought into effect on 20 September 2010. Under\n                    the MRA, regulations may be made by the SMC with the approval of the Minister\n                    for Health. The Applicant has applied for a declaration that reg 42 is void\n                    as it violates the rules of natural justice. It is also the Applicant’s\n                    case that the amendment of reg 42 was targeted at her. In support of this\n                    submission, the Applicant points out that reg 42 was brought into effect by\n                    the SMC on 20 September 2010 about six days after the 2nd DC was\n                    constituted (14 September 2010) and about four days after she was notified\n                    that the SMC had appointed the 2nd DC (16 September 2010). It was\n                    further submitted that the amendments brought into force on 20 September\n                    2010 related principally to the disciplinary process and the availability of the\n                    advice of legal assessors to the disciplinary committee. Further, the Applicant\n                    avers that the entire amendments brought into effect on 20 September 2010\n                    were subsequently repealed and reintroduced as part of a more comprehensive set\n                    of regulations brought into effect in December 2010. 15     Insofar as the challenge to reg 42 is\n                    based on it being contrary to natural justice, this challenge may be determinedex facieon the content of the amended\n                    reg 42. Insofar as the Applicant’s submission of bias or apprehension\n                    of bias on the part of the SMC is founded on its content and legislative\n                    chronology, this is public record. It is again not necessary for fairly\n                    disposing of the Applicant’s case on the record.",
        "Conclusion": "16     For the reasons set out above, each of these\n                    applications for discovery is dismissed. The costs of these applications shall\n                    be costs in the cause."
