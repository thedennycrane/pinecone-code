        "Undisputed Background": "4As set out in the Statement of Agreed Facts,1Foot Note 1×Record of Proceedings, Vol 2 p 370.Chinpo was incorporated in Singapore on 11 August 1970 by Tan Cheng Hoe (“Tan”). It carries on the businesses of “ship agencies & ship chandlers” (ie,representing ships and supplying bunker, stores, and spare parts to them) and “general wholesale trade (including general importers and exporters).” 5Tan was a director of Chinpo and its associated companies, Tonghae Shipping Agency (Private) Limited (“Tonghae”) and Great Best Trading (Private) Limited (“Great Best”) (collectively, the “Companies”). He was also a shareholder in Tonghae and Great Best, but not in Chinpo. There was no substantive separation between the Companies. They shared the same premises at 7500A Beach Road, #09-320/321 (the “Premises”), and the same set of employees. They used the same email account to communicate with entities from the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (“DPRK”), and used the same Bank of China (“BOC”) account (the “BOC Account”) to receive and perform remittances. 6Tan has two daughters, Tan Hui Tin (“Hui Tin”) and Tan Bee Tin (“Bee Tin”), both of whom were accounts executives in Chinpo as well as directors and/or shareholders in each of the Companies. Hui Tin and Bee Tin oversaw the day-to-day operations of the Companies, and all other staff reported to them. Still, Tan visited the Premises every day, and was consulted on “major matters” concerning the Companies.",
        "Dealings with entities from DPRK": "7In the 1970s, Tan began interacting with DPRK entities while working as an employee in his brother’s company, which dealt with DPRK entities. Subsequently, Korea Tonghae Shipping Co (“Korea Tonghae”), one of the largest ship operators in the DPRK, appointed Chinpo as its shipping agent. In 1984, Tonghae was established to be the shipping agent for Korea Tonghae, and Chinpo provided its ship agency services to other DPRK entities. Nevertheless, Chinpo continued to provide goods and services to the vessels of Korea Tonghae, while Tonghae processed the documentation for the vessels to enter and depart Singapore. 8After Korea Tonghae underwent a re-organisation in the late-1990s, Chinpo and Tonghae began providing their services to Ocean Maritime Management Company Limited (“OMM”) instead of Korea Tonghae. Tan characterised OMM as the “new name” of Korea Tonghae. Among the vessels administered by Korea Tonghae (and then OMM) was the DPRK-flaggedMVChong Chon Gang(the “Ship”), which was owned by Chongchongang Shipping Company Limited, a DPRK one-ship company. 9In 2005, Tan partitioned off part of the Premises for the DPRK Embassy in Singapore (“the Embassy”) to use as its mailing address. Tan offered the partitioned area to the Embassy without cost to build goodwill with the DPRK entities. No one from the Embassy was based permanently at the Premises. At the suggestion of Tan, the Embassy listed Tan as its “security guard” with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs of Singapore so that he could enter the partitioned area and collect mail for it. These arrangements have continued since.",
        "2 April 2009–3 July 2013 outward remittances totalling US$40,138,840.87": "10In the course of providing ship agency services to OMM, Chinpo received moneys from the sale of freight on behalf of OMM (via the BOC Account). With these funds, Chinpo paid for the costs of shipping the freight, the sums due to itself for ship agency services, and the salaries of the OMM staff stationed in Singapore. Thereafter, Chinpo remitted moneys left over to overseas entities in accordance with the instructions of OMM. Hui Tin and Bee Tin maintained the records of these remittances on behalf of OMM. 11According to the Statement of Agreed Facts, between 2 April 2009 and 3 July 2013, Chinpo made 605 outward remittances on behalf of OMM and the other DPRK entities from the BOC Account (the “605 Remittances”), and charged a fee of at least US$50 per remittance on most occasions. The total value of the 605 Remittances was US$40,138,840.87. 12By 2012, however, the demand for ship agency services from OMM had declined. Nevertheless, Chinpo maintained its office and kept its staff, hoping that business from OMM would pick up. Chinpo also continued remitting moneys for OMM to preserve its working relationship with OMM.",
        "8 July 2013 outward remittance of US$72,016.76": "13On 11 April 2013, the Ship departed the DPRK for a voyage to Cuba and back (the “Voyage”). It called at the port of Vostochny, Russia, to re-fuel, and took on 10,201mt (ie,metric tonnes) of steel plates. 14On 28 May 2013, Chinpo remitted US$54,269.76 to C.B. Fenton and Co., S.A. (“CB Fenton”), a shipping agent operating at the Panama Canal. This sum was payment for the transit expenses of the Ship in the Panama Canal (en route to Cuba), which the Ship passed through on 1 June 2013. 15On 4 June 2013, the Ship discharged its cargo of steel plates at Havana, Cuba. 16On 20 June 2013, the Ship docked at Mariel, Cuba, where it took on arms and related materiel (the “Materiel”) comprising: (a) six trailers of SA-2 and SA-3 surface-to-air missile systems (“SAMs”); (b) two MiG-21 aircraft and engines for them (“MiG-21s”); and (c) ammunition and miscellaneous arms-related materiel such as rifles and night-vision binoculars. 17On 24 June 2013, the Ship docked at Puerto Padre, Cuba, where it took on 10,500mt of sugar. Thereafter, it commenced its journey back to the DPRK. 18On 1 July 2013, Chinpo received €253,365.56 from Expedimar S.A. (“Expedimar”) for the cargo discharged at Havana. This inward remittance was received pursuant to an email instruction from OMM to Chinpo dated 23 June 2013, with Chinpo receiving the bill of lading of the Ship on 27 June 2013. 19On 8 July 2013, Chinpo remitted US$72,016.76 to CB Fenton for the return passage of the Ship through the Panama Canal (the “Transfer”). This outward remittance was made pursuant to an email instruction from OMM to Chinpo dated 8 July 2013, which was silent on the purpose of the remittance.2Foot Note 2×Record of Proceedings, Vol 2 p 375 (Exhibit P2). 20On 11 July 2013, the Ship was interdicted by the Panamanian authorities, who found the Materiel hidden under the 10,500mt of sugar.",
        "Legislative frameworks": "21At the outset, it is worthwhile to set out the legislative frameworks within which the DPRK Regulations Charge and the MCRBA Charge operate. 22Regulation 12(b) of the DPRK Regulations (“Reg 12(b)”) provides: Prohibition against provision of financial services and other resources 12. No person in Singapore and no citizen of Singapore outside Singapore shall — … (b)transfer financial assets or resources, or other assets or resources, that may reasonably be used to contribute to the nuclear-related, ballistic missile related, or other weapons of mass destruction related programs or activities of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We use “NRPA” (nuclear-related programs and activities) as shorthand for the nuclear-related, ballistic missile related, or other weapons of mass destruction related programs or activities of the DPRK. 23In respect of the MCRBA Charge, s 6 provides that no person shall carry on “remittance business” without a valid remittance license. As for what constitutes “remittance business”, s 2 of the MCRBA provides: Interpretation 2.—(1) In this Act, unless the context otherwise requires — … “remittance business” means the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons resident in another country or a territory outside Singapore; … (2) For the purposes of this Act, a person shall be deemed to be carrying on — … (b)remittance business if he offers to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person resident in another country. 24With these frameworks in mind, we turn to the decision of the DJ.",
        "Decision below": "",
        "DPRK Regulations Charge": "25The DJ identified three legal issues in relation to the DPRK Regulations Charge: (a)whether the Prosecution needed to prove that Chinpo knew that the Transfer that it made to CB Fenton (see [19] above) “may reasonably be used to contribute” to the NRPA of the DPRK (GD at [118]); (b)whether the Materiel related, and whether the Transfer could contribute, to the NRPA of the DPRK (GD at [128] and [134]); and (c)whether Chinpo exercised due care and attention to avoid breaching Reg 12(b) (GD at [135]). 26The DJ held that Reg 12(b) created a strict liability offence, and did not require the Prosecution to establish that Chinpo had knowledge that the Transfer “may reasonably be used to contribute” to the NRPA of the DPRK. Unlike the other provisions in the DPRK Regulations, Reg 12(b) contained no express mental element. Further, the words “may reasonably be used to contribute” therein did not imply that the person transferring the funds had to have known the intended use of the funds. Rather, the Prosecution only had to prove that the funds transferred could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. The general presumption in law that a mental element is a necessary ingredient of every offence was displaced. Parliament had intended to oblige persons to exercise “greater vigilance and due diligence” to avoid contributing to the NRPA of the DPRK. Nevertheless, s 79 of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“Penal Code”) provides for a defence of a mistake of fact (the “s 79 defence”). Hence, a person would not be liable for a breach of Reg 12(b) if it can be proved on a balance of probabilities that due care and attention to avoid the breach had been exercised (GD at [121]–[127]). 27The DJ found that the Materiel, which comprised SAMs, MiG-21s, and other conventional weaponry, could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK. The DPRK was known to use SAMs to defend its nuclear sites and MiG-21s in its military operations. Further, the Transfer was a necessary payment for the transportation of the Materiel from Cuba to the DPRK via the Panama Canal. Hence, the Transfer could reasonably be used to contribute to the NRPA of the DPRK (GD at [130]–[134]). 28The DJ found further that Chinpo had failed to exercise due care and diligence to avail itself of the s 79 defence. By 2012, Chinpo should have known that OMM and the other DPRK entities with whom it dealt were state-owned entities whose funds were under the control of the government of the DPRK. Chinpo had, through Tan, a long and close relationship with the entities and diplomats of the DPRK, and knew that the representatives of the DPRK entities from whom Chinpo received instructions worked not simply for the DPRK entities concerned but also for the DPRK government. Further, Chinpo knew that DPRK entities were subject to international sanctions that prevented them from opening bank accounts to remit moneys, and that they had been taking steps to circumvent these sanctions. Yet, Chinpo simply assumed the moneys that it had been asked to remit by the DPRK entities belonged to the DPRK entities, did not query the purposes of the remittances, and executed the remittance instructions without delay. Chinpo even helped to conceal the transactions by omitting the names of the vessels concerned from the remittance application forms submitted to the BOC. The Ship itself had previously been detained in Ukraine with AK-47 rifles on board, with information about the detention available online, and Chinpo had on 8 February 2010 performed a remittance of US$52,500.00 on behalf of OMM entitled “Chong Chon Gang – Penalty”. Further, Chinpo should have been suspicious of the purposes of the Voyage, having known that the Ship was traveling from the DPRK to Cuba through the Panama Canal, and having been asked by OMM to falsely declare the name of the Ship as “MV South Hill 2” to the BOC (GD at [135]–[150]).",
        "MCRBA Charge": "29It was undisputed that Chinpo did not have a valid remittance license at the material time. 30The DJ observed that a person who carried on a “remittance business” without a valid remittance license breached s 6 of the MCRBA. Further, s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA extended the reach of the MCRBA to persons or entities who transmitted moneys on behalf of other persons via such intermediaries as a bank (GD at [153]). 31The DJ held that an operation could come within s 2 of the MCRBA even if the making of remittances was not its core (or main or regular) function. The word “business” simply described an activity of a systematic and repetitive nature. Chinpo ended up holding large sums of moneys for OMM and the other DPRK entities. Moneys had been deposited with Chinpo even when no sums were due by their depositors to it, and where it had not otherwise been involved in the transactions. These deposits continued even after the depositors’ demand for ship agency and ship chandelling services from Chinpo had drastically declined. Chinpo had also informed OMM on 7 January 2013 that it would continue to “help your company for inward/outward remittances”. These remittances were clearly unrelated to the ship agency and ship chandelling services provided by Chinpo, and were made to assist the DPRK entities to access the banking system. An OMM representative had also agreed that OMM was using Chinpo as its payment agent (GD at [155]–[158]). 32The DJ held that s 2 of the MCRBA did not require that carrying out the 605 Remittancesper sehad to yield a monetary profit for Chinpo, and Chinpo did in fact gain from doing so. Chinpo had been motivated by its desire to maintain a working relationship with OMM and the DPRK entities for business gain. Further, in return for the assistance, Tan was given access to funds for his personal investments. For example, an OMM representative had granted Chinpo an interest-free loan of over S$1m to make silver investments (GD at [159]).",
        "The Appeal – DPRK Regulations Charge": "",
        "Chinpo’s Submissions": "78Chinpo submits that it did not carry on a “remittance business”. 79First, it did not make “remittances” under s 6 of the MCRBA. It simply put up applications to the BOC to perform the 605 Remittances. The BOC was the entity that transferred the funds to the payees concerned. The BOC was a licensed remittance agent, and bore the duties and obligations imposed by the MCRBA on a remittance business, particularly with regard to due diligence.25Foot Note 25×Appellant’s Submissions at [183]–[186]. 80Second, it did not profit monetarily from the making of the 605 Remittances, while a “business” is an activity carried out for gain. The US$50 that it charged on most of the instances where it made the remittances covered only its costs, particularly that of travelling to and from the BOC.26Foot Note 26×Appellant’s Submissions at [170]–[173]. 81Third, it effected the 605 Remittances merely incidentally to its primary businesses of ship agency and ship chandelling. All of the 605 Remittances were for the purpose of port disbursements, and the payees in question were mostly shipping agencies.27Foot Note 27×Appellant’s Submissions at [174]–[177].Moreover, the making of such transfers is part of the business of a shipping agent, who typically effects payments of the expenses that a ship incurs during its operations on the instructions of the ship owner. Imposing a licensing burden on shipping agents simply because they make such remittances would be unduly onerous.28Foot Note 28×Appellant’s Submissions at [178]–[182].",
        "Prosecution’s Submissions": "82The Prosecution argues that the term, “remittance”, under s 6 of the MCRBA should be interpreted broadly: to include a person whoengages a financial institutionto facilitatea transmission of funds to other persons outside Singapore. This is necessitated by the purpose of the MCRBA, which seeks to prevent money-laundering and counter the financing of terrorism (“AML/CFT”). Further, such an interpretation has been adopted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) in MAS Notice 3001 dated 24 April 2015 (last revised on 30 November 2015)29Foot Note 29×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 2, at Tab 48.(“MAS Notice 3001”), which provides AML/CFT guidance to holders of money-changers’ licenses and remittance licenses.30Foot Note 30×Respondent’s Submissions at [156]–[164]. 83The Prosecution accepts that remittances made incidentally to a core business fall outside s 6 of the MCRBA. However, it argues that once Chinpo is proven to have offered to transmit money on behalf of another person, s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBAapplies to shift the burden of proving the purpose of a remittance from the Prosecution to Chinpo. Specifically, Chinpo must prove on a balance of probabilities that the 605 Remittances were made only incidentally to its main business of ship agency and ship chandelling and not as a standalone business. 84The Prosecution adds that a remittance need not be carried out for the purpose of gain to fall within s 6 of the MCRBA. The test for a “business” is simply that of system, continuity, and repetition. Although the definitions of a “business” under the Business Registration Act (Cap 32, 2004 Rev Ed) (“BRA”) and the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“MLA”) do allude to an element of gain, the BRA and MLA are, unlike the MCRBA, predominantly concerned with consumer protection and not AML/CFT.31Foot Note 31×Respondent’s Submissions at [191]–[197]. 85The Prosecution submits finally that Chinpo carried on a remittance “business” within s 6 of the MCRBA in relation to the 605 Remittances. Chinpo offered to transmit moneys on behalf of the DPRK entities to persons outside Singapore, and by virtue of s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA, was deemed to be carryingon remittance business. Further, Chinpo was unable to rebut this presumption. By 2012, the demand for its ship agency and ship chandelling services from the DPRK entities had dwindled, yet Chinpo continued to accept large deposits of moneys from them – that far exceeded the sums due to it for its shipping-related services – for the purpose of transmitting the moneys to persons outside Singapore. This allowed the DPRK entities to access the international banking system, and circumvent the international sanctions imposed on the DPRK. Finally, Chinpo did in fact gain from carrying out the 605 Remittances. It maintained goodwill with the DPRK entities, and took the benefit of an interest-free loan made by a representative of OMM.",
        "Young Amicus Curiae’s Submissions": "86Ms Tung submits that the licensing requirement for “remittance businesses” under s 6 of the MCRBA extends to a person who engages an intermediary to effect transmissions of funds to persons outside Singapore. A “remittance” is defined as “accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons … outside Singapore” (s 2 of the MCRBA). Parliament in deciding to regulate “remittance houses” sought to address concerns about AML/CFT in the transmission of moneys (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(15 August 2005)vol 80 (“2005Debates”)32Foot Note 32×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 2, at Tab 52.at col 1224 (Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Finance)). Hence, Parliament could not have intended that the notion of “transmission” in s 2 of the MCRBA be understood so narrowly as to include only the mechanical act of transmitting moneys, but rather to include also the instructing of a financial intermediary to transmit moneys. In light of s 2(2)(b)of the MCRBA, a person will be presumed to be carrying on remittance business if he offers to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person outside Singapore. 87Ms Tung adds that the mere fact that a person transmits moneys, or engages intermediaries to transmit moneys, only as anunrelatedsecondarybusiness(as opposed to an activity incidental or ancillary to the core business), should not take him outside the scope of the MCRBA. The legislative intent is that even persons who carry on remittances as an activity secondary to the selling of stationery or the selling of general provisions must be licensed under the MCRBA.33Foot Note 33×Counsel’s Note at [4.6]. 88Ms Tung observes, on the other hand, that the legislative intent was to regulate only the remittance industry, which comprises those who offer remittances as a service in its own right, rather than persons who make remittances incidentally to the provision of their primary business services.34Foot Note 34×Counsel’s Note at [4.7].Nevertheless, by virtue of s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA, the licensing requirement under s 6 of the MCRBA would apply unless a person who offers to transmitmoneys on behalf of another person demonstrates that his transmission of moneys is made merely as an incident of the main business. It is fair to place this evidential burden on a person who transmits funds, because the scope and purpose of the transmissions would be a matter within his knowledge.",
        "Analysis": "89It is undisputed that Chinpo did not have a remittance license for the purpose of s 6 of the MCRBA at the time when it undertook the 605 Remittances. Accordingly, two questions remain: (a)First, whether the 605 Remittances constitute “remittances” within the ambit of the MCRBA; and (b)Second, whether Chinpo, in executing the 605 Remittances, conducted a “business” that attracted the licensing requirements under s 6 of the MCRBA. “Remittance” 90Section 2(1) of the MCRBA defines only the term, “remittance business”, but not the term, “remittance”. That said, based on the definition of a “remittance business”, a “remittance” appears to be the act of “accepting moneys for the purpose oftransmittingthem to persons resident in another country or a territory outside Singapore” [emphasis added]. Even so, the MCRBA is silent on what a transmission of moneys entails. 91The parties differ on the breadth with which “remittance” and “transmission” should be read. Chinpo argues that the terms encompass only the person who performs the actual transmission of money. The Prosecution and Ms Tung suggest that the terms should encompass a person under whose instructions the transmission of money is effected as well.  92When the MCRBA was conceived in 1979, the legislative concern was to protect the public from errant money-changers and remitters by imposing a licensing regime to preclude “undesirable persons” from conducting such businesses (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(7 September 1979)vol 3935Foot Note 35×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 2, at Tab 50.at col 410 (Hon Sui Sen, Minister for Finance)). In 1996, however, Parliament observed that remittance businesses could be used to perpetrate money-laundering activities. Hence, there was a need to impose on “remittance houses” record-keeping requirements over and above the licensing requirements to which they were already subject (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(2 May 1996)vol 66 (“1996Debates”)36Foot Note 36×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 2, at Tab 51.at col 36 (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance)). By 2005, AML/CFT had become the predominant focus of the MCRBA (2005Debatesat cols 1223–1224(Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Finance)): The amendments [to the MCRBA] aim to refine and better reflect the MAS’ supervisory approach towards holders of remittance licenses and moneychanging licenses. I should state at the outset that MAS’ supervision of these activitiesfocuses on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism. MAS doesnot supervise holders of these licenses for their safety and soundness. This approachof focusing on anti-money laundering rather than safety and soundness of remittance houses and money-changing operations is similar to those adopted by other reputable financial centres. It places responsibility on customers to choose their remittance channels wisely. [emphasis added]  93In pursuit of this AML/CFT object, Parliament took a broad view of the ambit of the monetary transmissions that fall within s 6 of the MCRBA. Thus, the crux of a “remittance” isanacceptance of funds from a payor and a facilitation of the delivery of the funds to an intended payee,regardless ofthe mechanics by which the funds are eventually delivered.An intermediary by accepting and then delivering funds from a payor to a payee adds a layer to the transaction that obscures the identity of the payor. The MCRBA seeks to address this concern by requiring that the intermediary be licensed and placed under the supervision of the MAS. This applies regardless of whether the intermediary personally delivers the funds to the intended payee, or engages another intermediary (whether a friend or a financial institution) to deliver the funds. 94In a written answer to a question on the MAS’ regulation of remittance business in 2002, the then-Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Lee Hsien Loong observed that a remittance may be made not only (directly) through an employee or an overseas agent, but also (indirectly) through another intermediary such as a friend, a relative, or even a bank (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(3 May 2002)vol 74 at col 715): The remittance industry has grown over the years, but it remains a traditional business, with many small players operating on the basis of relationship and trust. Many are sole proprietorships or family-owned partnerships which cannot institute the same degree of internal controls that larger financial institutions like banks insist upon.Also, remittance houses often use parties such asfriends,relatives,employeesandunregulated overseas agentsinstead ofbanksto deliver funds to designated beneficiaries overseas.… This is why it is difficult to introduce measures to enhance significantly the safety and soundness of remittance houses… [emphasis added in italics and bold italics]  95An overly-technical interpretation of what a “remittance” or “transmission” constitutes could also lead to illogical conclusions. In the globalised world of today, moneys may be transmitted in a myriad of ways. Except where a payment is made by the physical delivery of money tokens (notes and coins), the payment of money does not involve the transfer of any physical thing, nor even of personal rights and claims. Rather, it involves a series of transactions in which rights and claims are extinguished, to be replaced by new rights and claims in favour of other parties (Colin Bamford,Principles of International Financial Law(OxfordUniversity Press, 2nd Ed, 2015) at para 3.28). It is thus inconceivable that Parliament intended to prescribe the specific mechanics of the types of transactions that constitute “remittances” within the MCRBA. Instead, and particularly in light of the AML/CFT object of the MCRBA, the legislative focus was always on theresultof a transaction: thedelivery of funds on behalf of a payor to an intended payee. 96The application of the licensing framework of “remittance businesses” under the MCRBA to an (upstream) entity which accepts moneys from a payor and then instructs a financial institution to transmit the moneys to the intended payee is seen most clearly in MAS Notice 3001.37Foot Note 37×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 2, at Tab 48 p 1250.Paragraph 10.1(b) of MAS Notice 3001 expressly extends,inter alia,the customer due diligence requirements under MAS Notice 3001 to a person who “engages a financial institution, whether in Singapore or elsewhere, to facilitate the provision of remittance services.” These requirements include understanding the purpose and intended nature of any transactions that it is asked by a customer to undertake, and to monitor its relationships with its customers to ensure that it does not inadvertently facilitate money-laundering or the financing of terrorism. 97It is undisputed that the 605 Remittances involved Chinpo accepting the moneys of various DPRK entities and then engaging the BOC to deliver a total of US$40,138,840.87 to the intended payees via telegraphic transfers. Accordingly, the 605 Remittances constitute “remittances” for the purpose of the MCRBA. “Business” 98Section 6 of the MCRBA reads: No person to carry on remittance business without licence 6.—(1) No person shall carry on or advertise that he carries on remittance business unless he is in possession of a valid remittance licence. (2) Any person who contravenes subsection (1) shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $100,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 2 years or to both and, in the case of a continuing offence, to a fine not exceeding $10,000 for every day during which the offence continues after conviction. 99Pursuant to s 2(1) of the MCRBA, “remittance business” means “the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons resident in another country or a territory outside Singapore”. However, the MCRBA does not define the circumstances in which the acceptance of moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons outside Singapore will constitute the carrying on of a “business” of remittances that attracts the licensing requirements under s 6 of the MCRBA. Nevertheless, pursuant to s 2(2)(b)of the MCRBA, a person is deemed to be carrying on remittance business if he “offers to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person resident in another country”. 100We agree with the submission of the Prosecution and Ms Tung that s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA raises a rebuttable presumption of the carrying on of a remittance business by aperson (the “Remitter”) who offers to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person outside Singapore. Such a presumption follows from the natural and ordinary meaning of s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA, and we note thatChinpo did not in its written submissions or at the hearing before us advance any argument to the contrary. More importantly, the purpose for which a remittance of moneys is made (ie, whether it is for the purpose ofa “business” of effecting remittances) is a matter that is purely within the knowledge of the Remitter, who is also best-placed to retrieve any documentary evidence relating to the transactions that he has undertaken. Placing the evidentiary burden on him to prove the purpose of the transaction is thus justified. The observations inSheagars/o T M Veloo v Belfield International (Hong Kong) Ltd[2014] 3 SLR 52438Foot Note 38×Respondent’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 1, at Tab 30.(“Sheagar”)at [38]−[39] on the rationale for s 3 of the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed)39Foot Note 39×YoungAmicus Curiae’s Bundle of Authorities, Vol 1, at Tab 9.(“MLA”), which deems a person “who lends a sum of money in consideration of a larger sum being repaid” to be carrying on the business of moneylending, apply with equal force here: 38 … [Section] 3 of the MLA operates to shift the burden onto the lender to prove that he was not carrying on the business of moneylending. The rationale for such a presumption was explained by the Privy Council inChowYoong Hong v Choong Fah Rubber Manufactory[1962] AC 209 at 218 in the following terms: To lend money is not the same thing as to carry on the business of moneylending. In order to prove that a man is a moneylender within the meaning of the Ordinance, it is necessary to show some degree ofsystem and continuityin his moneylending transactions. If he wereleft to discharge this burden without the aid of any presumption, a defendant might frequently be in a difficulty. He might have had only one or two transactions with the moneylender and he might find it difficult to obtain evidence about the business done by the moneylender with other parties. Section 3 enables a defendant to found his claim on proof of a single loan made to him at interest, it being presumed, in the absence of rebutting evidence, that there were sufficient other transactions of a similar sort to amount to carrying on of business. 39 We agree with these observations and add the further point that the scope of the lender’s business operations would be a matter within the lender’s knowledge. Therefore, the burden placed on the lender would not be an unduly onerous one. [emphasis added] 101Just as the MLA prohibits the business of moneylending rather than the act of lending money (Sheagarat [30];LenaLeowardi v Yeap Cheen Soo[2015] 1 SLR 581(“LenaLeowardi”)at [27]), what the MCRBA prohibits is thebusinessof accepting moneys for transmission to persons outside Singapore rather than the mereactto that effect. The legislative debates consistently show that the intent of Parliament is to regulate the remittanceindustry, which comprises persons who offer remittancesas a service in its own rightrather than simplyas anincident totheir core business. In other words, the focus of s 6 of the MCRBA ispayor-Remitter relationships that have as their primary purpose the making of remittances: (a)In 1996, Parliamentarians identified the “remitters” who were subject to the licensing requirements under the MCRBA as the persons who serviced “older Singaporeans who remit money to their relatives in China, India and elsewhere in Southeast Asia” and “foreign workers who remit their earnings to their families overseas” (1996Debatesat col 38(Dr Ow Chin Hock, Member of Parliament for Leng Kee)). (b)In 2005, the then-Second Minister for Finance described as the “industry” of “remittance houses” those persons who provide as a standalone financial service the delivery of funds to intended recipients outside Singapore. These persons provide an alternative channel (besides banks and large financial institutions) for persons in Singapore to transmit funds to persons outside Singapore (2005Debatesat col 1224(Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Minister for Education and Second Minister for Finance)). 102At common law, the test for the carrying on of a business is that of the undertaking of the relevant transactions with “some degree of system and continuity” (Sheagarat [38] citingChowYoong Hong v Choong Fah Rubber Manufactory[1962] AC 209 at 218 (see extract at [100] above)). Where the transactions are undertaken only incidentally to the provision of other services, the requisite degree of system and continuity to constitute a “business” would generally not be established (SubramaniamDhanapakiam v Ghaanthimathi[1991] 1 SLR(R) 16440Foot Note 40×Appellant’s Bundle of Authorities, Tab V.at [10] citingLitchfield v Dreyfus[1906] 1 KB 584at 590). This is ultimately a question of fact. InSubramanian, a housewife had on multiple occasions lent money to her neighbour, who paid interest on the loans on her own accord at rates decided by herself. Despite the frequency with which the loans had been made, Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was) held that the housewife had not been in the business of moneylending because she had simply lent the moneys as an incident of her relationship with the borrower as friends (at [11]): … The loans were friendly loans between two long-time friends. Interest was not demanded but accepted when offered. The interest was not exorbitant and varied in accordance with the generosity of the defendant. The [housewife] did not lend to all and sundry. On these facts, there was no question of the [housewife] being a moneylender as defined in the [MLA]… 103Similarly, Mr Ng Sheng, a deputy director with the MAS who supervises the money-changing and remittance sector, and who gave evidence on behalf of the Prosecution, accepted that an employer does not require a remittance license to send the wage moneys of his domestic helper to her family abroad.41Foot Note 41×Record of Proceedings, Vol 1 p 102.In such a case, the remittance is made only incidentally to the employer-helper relationship, and hence falls outside the scope of the MCRBA. 104There is however, a distinction between the executing of remittances as an activity related andincidentalto acore business, and the executing of remittances as an activity unrelated andsecondaryto a core business.Only the former falls outside the legislative ambit of the MCRBA. Parliament has made clear its intention to regulate those persons who offer remittances as a service while engaging in an unrelated “main business” of running a “provision shop” or a “stationery shop” (1996Debatesat cols 40–41 (Dr Richard Hu Tsu Tau, Minister for Finance)): Dr Ow also wants to know what is the estimated value of the money-changing transactions and the amounts of remittance handled per day. Unfortunately, complete information on the volumes of money-changing and remittance businesses is not available as many of these businesses are small sole-proprietorships and participants are also engaged in other businesses such as provision shop and stationery shop transactions and therefore do not keep proper records of their transactions. This is especially so for the large number of small money-changers. As for remittance businesses, the volumes vary widely, depending on whether the licensees conduct remittance business as their main business or as a secondary activity.Based on MAS’ inspection of some remittance licensees, MAS has found thatsome of them who conduct remittance business as a secondary business handled only about $50,000 worth of remittance business a month. Some medium-sized licensees handle $500,000 worth of remittances monthly while some licensees whose main business is remittance can handle up to $3 million each per month. [emphasis added] 105Hence, as with the presumption of the carrying on of moneylending business under s 3 of the MLA, the presumption of the carrying on of remittance business under s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBAis rebutted if the Remitter proves that he does not carry on the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons outside Singapore. Thus, the general approach to determine whether a person who has accepted moneys for transmission to persons outside Singapore has fallen afoul of s 6 of the MCRBA is as follows (adapted fromSheagarat [75] andLenaLeowardiat [29]): (a)The Prosecution must prove that the Remitter was not in possession of a valid remittance business license at the time when he made the remittances in question. (b)The Prosecution must prove further that the Remitter in making the remittances in question carried on the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons outside Singapore. However, if the Prosecution can establish that the Remitter offered to transmit money on behalf of any person to another person resident in another country, it may rely on the presumption contained in s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA to discharge this burden. (c)The burden then shifts to the lender to prove on a balance of probabilities that he did not carry on the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons outside Singapore. This can be achieved,inter alia, by proving thatthe remittances were undertaken only as an incident of a main business, but not if the making of the remittances is so unrelated to the main business as to constitute a secondary business. 106With these considerations in mind, we turn to the 605 Remittances. The 605 Remittances 107It is undisputed that Chinpo was not in possession of a valid remittance license when it made the 605 Remittances between 2 April 2009 and 3 July 2013. Accordingly, all that remains to be considered is whether Chinpo in making the 605 Remittances carried on the business of accepting moneys for the purpose of transmitting them to persons outside Singapore. 108In our view, the presumption under s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA arises to place onChinpo the burden of proving the purpose of the transactions. Chinpo offered to transmit money on behalf of the DPRK entities to their intended payees outside Singapore. This is particularly clear in an email on 7 January 2013 from Tan to OMM in which he promises to “help your company for inward/outward remittances” by continuing to operate Chinpo despite the decline in the demand for ship agency and ship chandelling services from the DPRK entities that caused Chinpo to operate at a monthly loss of approximately S$8,000.00.42Foot Note 42×Record of Proceedings, Vol 6 p 421.But even before that, Chinpo had readily and willingly accepted payments from the DPRK entities of large sums, which far exceeded the amounts that they owed Chinpo for ship agency and ship chandelling. This was confirmed by Tan in his statement recorded on 13 February 2014 under s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed),43Foot Note 43×Record of Proceedings, Vol 6 p 695 (Question 123).and is exemplified by an email from Chinpo to “Korea Susan Shipping” (“KSS”) in which Chinpo acknowledges receipt of US$156,000.00 from KSS when the debt due from KSS to Chinpo was only US$14,042.35. Thereafter, Chinpo had readily procured the remittance of excess amounts to persons outside Singapore as directed by the DPRK entities, regardless of whether these outward remittances were related to the ship agency and ship chandelling services provided by it. Through its conduct, therefore, Chinpo offered to transmit money on behalf of the DPRK entities to their intended payees outside Singapore. Pursuant to s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA, the evidential burden thus shifts toChinpo to prove that it did not carry on the 605 Remittances as a business. 109The Prosecution conceded that it was unclear whether every one of the 605 Remittances had been made as part of a standalone business of funds transmission, rather than as an incident to the ship agency and ship chandelling services carried out by Chinpo. Nevertheless, due to s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBA, the burden rests withChinpo to prove that it had not made the 605 Remittances as part of remittance business. Chinpo never inquired about, and was unfamiliar with, the purposes of the remittances that it made on the instructions of the DPRK entities. Moreover, Chinpo was not involved in many of the underlying contracts that gave rise to the need for the DPRK entities to make the 605 Remittances. As the DJ noted, Hui Tin, one of Tan’s daughters who was an accounts executive in Chinpo to whom all staff in the company reported, could not confirm whether many of the 605 Remittances were made for “shipping related” purposes (GD at [71]–[73]): 71 She [ie, Hui Tin] was first asked to look at exhibit P3-3 (P47), a remittance to Harvest International (China) Limited. She was referred to the email from OMM which stated ‘Pls remit USD 35000 to the attached bank account and let me have the slip.’ She agreed that the purpose of the remittance was not stated in the email. However, she claimed that the OMM representative would have informed Chinpo of its purpose but she was unable to remember what was said. She was then asked: Q. Does Harvest International have anything to do with shipping? The payee is Harvest International. Do they have anything to do with shipping? A. He’s OMM rep, we believe that is all shipping related. Q. So, when you say \"we believe it is shipping related\" because he told you, you assumed it must be shipping related? Is that what you mean? A. Yes, we have been in business so long, we have to believe what they say. We have no reason not to believe it is -- it is wrong, no reason. Q. Well, on the face of it, does it appear to have anything to do with shipping? A. I believe it’s shipping related because he – he’s done shipping and he handles the other vessels, yes, I believe it is. 72  She was referred to another remittance in P3-3 (pg 51) to Yongsheng (Liaoning) Economic and Trading Co. Ltd. on 4 May 2011 and asked its purpose. She again said that she was unable to recall. She was next referred to a remittance of US$30,000 on 2 August 2011 to Fu Zan Shu (P3-3, pg100). She said that she did not know the payee and was unable to recall the purpose. She was next referred to another remittance to Harvest International (China) Limited (pg 146 of P3-3) for the sum of US$25,000 on 19 October 2011. She was also unable to recall the purpose of the remittance. 73  She was referred to a remittance dated 3 January 2012 to Become Co., Ltd for the sum of JPY 10,800,000 (pg 274 of P3-4). Asked if it had anything to do with shipping, she replied that she did not know. Under cross-examination, she was referred to another remittance of JPY 312,440 dated 12 June 2012 to Become Co., Ltd and a sales agreement (pgs 345-348 of P3-4). She again said that she was unable to recall the purpose of the remittance. Lastly, in respect of the remittance dated 15 August 2012 for the sum of JPY500,000 to Makoto Nishida (p 362 of P3-4), she again replied that she was unable to recall what the remittance was for. 110This lack of interest in and knowledge of the purpose of so many of the 605 Remittances by Chinpo belied its claim that they were all “shipping related”. Had all (or even most) of the 605 Remittances truly been related and incidental to the provision by Chinpo of ship agency and ship chandelling services to the DPRK entities, we would expect Chinpo to have been familiar with the purposes for which they were made, and more specifically, the way in which the remittances facilitated its provision of the ship agency and ship chandelling services to the DPRK entities. 111On balance therefore, we cannot accept the contention that Chinpo undertook the 605 Remittances purely incidentally to its avowed primary business of ship agency and ship chandelling, particularly given the evidence of Chinpo’s own expert, Mr Dennis D’Cotta, that it would be “unusual” and “uncommon” for a shipping agent or chandler to, as Chinpo did, hold on to large sums of money for a ship owner.44Foot Note 44×Record of Proceedings, Vol 2 pp 240–241.Accordingly, we find that Chinpo is unable to rebut the presumption under s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBAthat it had been carrying on a “remittance business” for the purpose of s 6(1) of the MCRBA. 112Indeed, the evidence suggests that Chinpo was blindly receiving moneys from the DPRK entities, and then paying the moneys to their intended payees, in respect of matters unconnected with its ship agency and ship chandelling services. Although Chinpo engaged the BOC to facilitate the 605 Remittances, it had done so in its own name, thereby concealing the identity of the DPRK entities, which were the true payors. This is the very mischief that the MCRBA seeks to avoid, and which Parliament seeks to address through the licensing regime for remittance businesses under s 6 of the MCRBA. Monetary gain 113We are unable to accept the contention that Chinpo must have undertaken the 605 Remittances for the purpose of gain in order to have carried on a remittance business under the MCRBA. Nothing in the MCRBA requires the acceptance of moneys for the purpose of transmission to persons outside Singapore to have been carried out for gain. Moreover, a Remitter is presumed under s 2(2)(b) of the MCRBAto have been carrying on a remittance business upon proof of anofferby it to transmit moneys, without more. 114In any event, we agree with the DJ that even if the undertaking of remittances for the purpose of gain is an essential element of a remittance business under s 2(1) of the MCRBA, there is no need for the transactionsper seto yield a monetary profit. Here, the ship agency and ship chandelling businesses of Chinpo had dwindled due to falling demand for such services from the DPRK entities.45Foot Note 45×Record of Proceedings, Vol 6 p 421.It was undisputed that Chinpo in making the 605 Remittances had been motivated by a desire to maintain goodwill with the DPRK entities.46Foot Note 46×Record of Proceedings, Vol 2 p 371 paragraph 14.Further, as the DJ found, Chinpo had in fact enjoyed monetary gains from its making of the 605 Remittances (GD at [159]): … [I]n return for the assistance, [Tan] was able to gain access to funds to make his own investments. It was undisputed that Kim Yu Il granted an interest free loan of more than a million dollars for silver investments to Chinpo. To quote another example, Chinpo made US$9,600 for a purported loan by Kim Yu Il to Samilpo. 115Accordingly, we uphold the conviction of Chinpo on the MCRBA Charge.",
        "The Appeal – MCRBA Charge": "",
        "Sentence": "116We agree with the DJ that general deterrence is the main sentencing consideration for the MCRBA Charge. The objective of the system of licensing under the MCRBA is to bring all persons providing remittance services within the ambit of certain minimum legal and regulatory requirements and the supervision of MAS. Licensees are expected to put in place appropriate systems and perform relevant customer due diligence measures to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing. 117In all, Chinpo performed 605 remittances over a period of about four years, which resulted in the remission of a staggering US$40,138,840.87. This is an offence of an unprecedented volume and over an unprecedented duration in Singapore. The maximum fine of S$100,000 is thus warranted.",
        "Conclusion": "118For the above reasons, we allow the appeal in part. We set aside Chinpo’s conviction and sentence on the DPRK Regulations Charge, but affirm the DJ’s decision in respect of the MCRBA Charge. We accordingly order that the fine of S$80,000 paid by Chinpo in relation to the DPRK Regulations Charge be refunded.  119It remains for us to recordour deep gratitude to the YoungAmicus Curiae, Ms Tung, for her comprehensive and cogent written and oral submissions, from which we obtained considerable assistance. We commend her for the diligence and care with which she applied herself in her efforts to assist us as an officer of the court.
