        "The factual background": "5 At all material times, the father is a French citizen, having been\n\nborn on 12 June 1960 in Agen (Lot et Garonne), France. Though he is a legally trained\n\nlawyer, and a member of the Paris bar, he no longer practised law. He became an in-house\n\nBank tax consultant and at all material times he was working for a bank in Singapore. The\n\nmother was born on 20 November 1963 in Kelaa Des Srangna, Morocco. She is a medical doctor\n\nin charge of clinical research. As of July 2000, she was working as the Registrar of the\n\nDepartment of Infectious Disease, Communicable Diseases Centre, Tan Tock Seng Hospital.\n\nShe is a citizen of both Morocco and France. From August 2000 she took up another\n\nemployment in England, tenable for three years. The mother brought the daughter along and\n\nthey have been living in London since August 2000. As from that date her habitual\n\nresidence was changed from Singapore to London. .6 The couple first met way back in 1988 when they were both working in\n\nParis, France. At that time, he was an active homosexual. She knew about this. However,\n\nthey married on 26 June 1993 in Biscarosse, France.7 The daughter was born on 30 October 1994 in Paris, (14thdistrict), France. The family of three lived in Paris, France until the parents moved to\n\nSingapore in January 1998.8 It has to be noted that the marriage has been turbulent, to say the\n\nleast. It is certainly not appropriate and I do not wish to convey any impression that I\n\nam making any finding of facts, drawing any inferences or apportioning blame. As the\n\nevents would affect the daughter’s interest, I shall be both circumspect and brief in\n\ndescribing some of the events which had happened in Singapore. The father carried on his\n\nbisexual activities; he claimed that it was not in any way at the expense of the marriage\n\nand they did not render him in any way unfit to exercise guardianship rights over the\n\ndaughter. The wife on the other hand alleged that he had been callous and had shown\n\npropensity for domestic violence. She also alleged that the father had subjected the\n\ndaughter to sexual abuse. The incidents were reported to the Ministry of Community\n\nDevelopment (‘the MCD\") and the Police. Eventually, the MCD closed their\n\ninvestigations and did not place any restrictions on the father from seeing the child. The\n\npolice ceased their investigation after the daughter left Singapore. She was no longer\n\nwithin the jurisdiction of the police. The father most strenuously denied this allegation\n\nas scurrilous and had produced evidence of independent experts to prove that nothing of\n\nthe kind had happened and that in fact the daughter had been coached and taught by the\n\nwife to imagine those things. One doctor had opined that the wife had in the latter part\n\nof 2000 coached the daughter to draw phallic symbols and that it was calculated to make\n\nthe child appear to be a victim of child sexual abuse. The father went on to allege that\n\nthe wife had assaulted him in the presence of the daughter and had caused the child a lot\n\nmental anguish and pain. I repeat that apart from stating the allegations, I am not going\n\ninto the allegations and counter-allegations. I must also say that I do not know if there\n\nare any merits in the allegations or the counter-allegations.9 Arising out of a number of domestic incidents, the wife on 14 June\n\n2000 instituted an Originating Summons in the Singapore High Court under the Guardianship\n\nof Infants Act, Cap 122 and asked for the following reliefs. She asked for sole custody,\n\ncare and control of the daughter with no access to the father until further order,\n\nmaintenance for the child, a business class air-ticket once a year to France. Affidavits\n\nwere filed by the mother making a number of allegations about the unfitness of the father\n\nwhich disqualified him from the exercise of any guardianship rights over the daughter. He\n\ncountered with allegations of his own, that she had extra-marital affairs in Singapore and\n\nelsewhere and had maliciously made use of the daughter to blackmail him, without any\n\nregard for the consequences upon the daughter.10 On the following day, the father commenced similar proceedings under\n\nthe same Act against the mother for interim legal custody of the daughter \"pending\n\nthe outcome of the (father’s) divorce and custody proceedings in France against the\n\n(mother)\". He also asked that the mother be permitted supervised access to the\n\ndaughter in the presence of a third party. In support of his application, he alleged that\n\nthe wife was having an affair with a musician in a hotel and that she had conducted the\n\nrelationship in the presence of the daughter, which was not good for the daughter. He\n\nalleged that she had received psychiatric treatment which raised serious questions about\n\nher fitness to exercise custody, care and control of the daughter. He also accused her of\n\nhaving inflicted injuries on herself and falsely accusing him of having inflicted them. He\n\nalso accused her of unlawfully taking the daughter out of the court’s jurisdiction.\n\nThe mother had in mid 2000 taken the daughter to Durban, South Africa where she attended a\n\nConference to help those suffering from Aids.11 In the father’s affidavit filed on 15 June 2000 he\n\n\"reserved\" his \"rights as a French citizen\" to have his divorce andcustodymatters heard by the French Court under Articles 14 and 15 of the French Code of Civil\n\nProceedings. He went on to declare that the Originating Summons that he had filed did not\n\n\"imply that he submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts on any issue of\n\n(his) divorce\".12 At about the same time, the father had engaged lawyers in France. On\n\n14thJune 2000 he filed for divorce in the District Court of Paris, France, and\n\nfor orders in relation to the daughter, which included orders relating to custody and\n\naccess. In that petition, he applied for interim custody of the daughter pending the\n\nhearing of the divorce petition. In April, 2000 the District Court of Paris attempted to\n\nreconcile the parties. On 10thJune 2000 the District Court of Paris permitted\n\nthe father to proceed with the divorce petition. As interim measures, the court ordered\n\ninter alia that both parents exercise parental authority in common, that the daughter\n\nshall remain at the mother’s domicile and usual place of resident, that the father\n\nhave fortnightly access to the daughter, that the father pay maintenance for the daughter\n\nand alimony for the mother and that a court appointed doctor perform a medical\n\npsychological examination on the daughter and interview the parents. Dr Diran Donabedian\n\nwas appointed as the doctor by the Judge of Family Affairs. The father refused to be\n\ninterviewed by Dr Donabedian. In March 2001, he appealed against the orders made on 10thJune 2000 and applied to vary the access and maintenance. He failed in his appeal. He\n\nappealed again in April 2001 but his second appeal failed.13 Finally, the father agreed to be interviewed by Dr Donabedian. He\n\nhad to ask the court to appoint the doctor again and for that he was ordered to pay 2,000\n\nFrancs. He was examined and Dr Donabedian submitted a further report to the court after\n\ninterviewing the father. In the report dated 20 June 2001 the doctor opined that the\n\nmaternal home with the mother in London, UK was \"enough supporting and\n\nstructuring\".14 In the meantime, the District Court of Paris ordered that the\n\ndaughter remain with the mother in London. The father has been exercising his rights of\n\naccess pursuant to the order of 10thJune 2000. He had later obtained overnight\n\naccess.15 Counsel for the father made two principal submissions in support of\n\nhis application that the High Court of Singapore should decide on the question of interim\n\ncustody. First he said all the evidence supporting or refuting the allegations and counter\n\nallegations of both parties were available in Singapore. The witnesses could be examined\n\nand cross examined in court. According to the opinion of an expert on French law, Mr\n\nRoger-Vasselin, it was confirmed that an order of this court would be enforceable in\n\nFrance since the 5 conditions would be satisfied, namely: (1) the Singapore court would be\n\ncompetent to issue the order; (2) the proceedings here would be regular; (3) Singapore law\n\nwould be the applicable law under the French rules governing conflicts of law; (4) the\n\njudgment would be compatible with international public order rules; and (5) the judgment\n\nwould be exempt from \"fraud to the law\". In view of the juridical and forensic\n\nadvantages, counsel submitted that Singapore courts were the appropriate and suitable\n\nforum. Secondly, counsel made the alternative submission that justice would require a\n\nrefusal of the stay which the mother was asking because there were special circumstances.\n\nThough the French court had jurisdiction, he submitted that the best interest of the\n\ndaughter required early determination of the questions of custody. Care and control.\n\nWhatever orders which the French court had made were merely procedural and interim in\n\nnature. The mother had not filed her answer to the divorce petition. Vital evidence on the\n\nunsuitability of the mother to have custody were easily available in Singapore.16 Having considered the overall picture, I was not persuaded by those\n\nsubmissions. In the context of these proceedings involving the custody of a child, an\n\nimportant consideration must be the child’s cultural connections with and affinity\n\nfor the cultural and societal environment which the forum serves. This is self-evident: a\n\nchild’s best interest is best determined by the forum which is best equipped to\n\ndetermine what is best for the child in all material respects ranging from its health\n\ncare, education, moral and spiritual and other relevant needs. From this point of view,\n\nthe French court emerged as pre-eminently more appropriate. The child was living in London\n\nwith the mother at the material time. The father even obtained overnight access and had\n\nexercised it by bringing her to France to be with his extended family.17 Secondly, he himself had chosen to have the issues of custody and\n\naccess determined by the French court. By that choice, he clearly affirmed the positive\n\nimperatives of having the French court decide the fate of a child brought forth by a\n\nFrench couple with the closest links with France than with any other country in the world.\n\nHe had invoked the guardianship jurisdiction of this court by Originating Summons because\n\nhe thought the mother was going to spirit his daughter away from the jurisdiction where\n\nthe vital evidence against the mother were most easily available. I was not at all\n\nsatisfied that he could not with facility provide those critical evidence to the French\n\ncourt. They could be made available. Counsel for the father observed that there would not\n\nbe cross examination of the witness. That feature was the same for all processes in\n\ncivilian jurisdictions; it is up the tribunal to make the inquiries and make the\n\nassessments. The quality of assessments in those civilian jurisdiction had not been shown\n\nto be inferior to those obtained in common law adversarial systems.18 Thirdly, I had no doubt that medical and welfare reports would be\n\navailable to the court from experts appointed to assist the court in France. They can\n\nreport both on the psychological suitability of both parties as parents and on the\n\npsychological profile of the daughter, including the question whether she had been\n\nsexually abused by the father. Undoubtedly, she could be interviewed with profit by the\n\ntribunal. There was ample evidence, and it was not seriously disputed, that the daughter\n\nwas intelligent and mature.19 Fourthly, I was not at all concerned that any injustice would arise\n\nif questions of custody and related issues were left to the French court to determine. The\n\npoint was made by the father that \"proceedings in France (took) an inordinately long\n\ntime to be heard\". By the time the issues of custody, care and control were decided\n\non the merits, the child would have been under the mother’s care and control for 2\n\nyears. The short answer was that in the opinion of the doctor appointed by the French\n\ncourt, the maternal home in London provided by the mother was sufficient and provided\n\n\"structuring\" necessary for the child. On the contrary, I feared that if I did\n\nnot stay both the Originating Summonses, the result would be that the Singapore High Court\n\nwould have continued with hearing the father’s application for interim custody, which\n\nwould have included a hearing of a number of witnesses and the examination of the\n\ndaughter. That process could have further destabilised the daughter. On the other hand,\n\nthe French court had granted interim custody to the mother with overnight access to the\n\nfather who, I had noted, had to fly to England to exercise his rights of access. That\n\nwould be the price which any true love of a father could sustain without any complaint.20 Having considered all these main reasons and all other relevant\n\ncircumstances as a whole, I decided that a stay of both Originating Summons in preference\n\nand deference to the French court was inevitable.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
