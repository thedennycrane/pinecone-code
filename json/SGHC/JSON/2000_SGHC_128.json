        "Judicial managers` arguments": "The judicial managers argued that based on rr 41, 44 and 50 of the Companies Regulations (Cap 50, Rg 1, 1990 Ed) (`the Regulations`) which deal with proof of debts in judicial management and by drawing an analogy in respect of payments under proof of debts for company in liquidation, a creditor is only entitled to compute interest up to the date of the judicial management order. They pointed out that under r 41, in a judicial management, every creditor was obliged to prove his debt. Such proof had, pursuant to r 44(1), to be in compliance with Form 77 in the Second Schedule to the Regulations. That form provides for the amount of the debt to be calculated as of the date of the commencement of the judicial management. The judicial managers contended that since Form 77 did not provide for proof of interest after the commencement of the judicial management, the bank was not entitled to make any claim for interest accruing after that date.I considered the above argument to be misconceived. It was muddling the creditor`s right to charge and recover interest with its right to be involved in the judicial management. As counsel for the bank submitted, the purpose of requiring each creditor to file a proof of debt in a judicial management is to enable the judicial manager to determine each creditor`s entitlement to participate in the scheme of judicial management and the value of voting rights in this participation. As Choong and Rajah state (at p 132):The importance in lodging a proof cannot be overstated. The acceptance of the proof by the judicial manager is a condition precedent to a creditor`s participation in the scheme of judicial management. Only creditors whose claims have been accepted by the judicial manager may vote on whether to approve the judicial manager`s proposals.The proof of debt in a judicial management does not crystallise the liabilities of the company vis-.-vis its creditors for the purposes of repayment of debt unlike in a liquidation situation. The fact that Form 77 only calls for the calculation of interest up to the date of the judicial management order does not mean that interest  on a secured debt would cease to accrue. What it means is that for the purposes of determining the amount of the secured creditors` debt and in turn his voting rights in the judicial management, an artificial line is drawn on the date of the order and indebtedness accruing after that date is not counted.Next, the judicial managers relied on r 50 of the Regulations. This reads:On any debt or sum, payable at a certain time or otherwise whereon interest is not reserved or agreed for, and which is overdue at the date of the judicial management order, the creditor may prove for interest at a rate not exceeding 6% per annum to that date from the time when the debt or sum was payable, if the debt or sum is payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time, and if payable otherwise, then from the time when a demand in writing has been made, giving notice that interest will be claimed from the date of the demand until the time of payment.They argued that if in a case where interest had not been agreed upon, interest would only be calculated up to the date of judicial management order then in a case, as here, where interest had been agreed upon, there would be no reason for such a debt to be treated differently and the interest to be calculated beyond the date of the judicial management order.I could not accept the interpretation which the judicial managers gave to r 50. In my judgment, it has no effect at all on the period during which interest which had been the subject of a contractual agreement would continue to accrue. It appeared to me that r 50 was designed to allow creditors who had no previous contractual arrangements with the company on interest to include an interest component in their proofs in order to increase their voting rights. The rule embodies the recognition that if such creditors (usually trade creditors) were to start legal proceedings against the company and recover judgment for their debts they would, in all probability, be awarded interest by the court. These creditors had, however, been prohibited from taking such action by the passing of the judicial management order and thus the passing of the rule was, I considered, a way of putting these creditors, notionally, in the situation in which they would have been had the order not been made. It would also help such creditors have a greater say in the judicial management scheme vis-.-vis the secured creditors with contractually agreed interest arrangements who would otherwise have greater voting rights simply by reason of the accrual of interest up to the date of the order even though the principal sum owing to them was equal or less than that owing to the trade creditor.Whilst it is always possible for the legislature to abrogate contractual arrangements on interest, this must be done expressly. It cannot be done in the convoluted fashion which judicial managers put forward, ie that the effect of expressly giving people who are not contractually entitled to interest a right to prove for interest at a particular rate up to the date of the judicial management order, is implicitly to deprive people who have such contractual rights to interest from enjoying those rights after the date of the order.The next argument put forward by the judicial managers relied on the fact that in the liquidation of a company, all interest would cease to run as of the date of the winding-up order. They submitted that the same rule should apply to the judicial management situation. I am afraid that I could not follow their argument on this  point at all. Liquidation and judicial management are two entirely distinct regimes with distinct legal consequences. There is absolutely no logical reason why simply because interest ceases to run against the company in liquidation it should also cease to run against the company in judicial management. It is also not correct that interest ceases to run under all circumstances when the company is put into liquidation. A secured creditor is entitled to contractual interest up to the date of the liquidation of his security notwithstanding the prior winding up of the debtor company. SeeRe Securitibank[1980] 2 NZLR 714. It is only when the creditor is unsecured or wishes to surrender his security and prove in the liquidation as an unsecured creditor that he is subject to the limitations on interest provided by the liquidation regime.",
        "Conclusion": "I could not find a legal or a logical basis which justified the judicial managers` application to stop interest on the mortgage running from the date of their appointment. The judicial managers were the agents of the company (see s 227I(1)(a)) and their powers could not exceed that of their principal. Under the contract, the company could not redeem the mortgage except by paying all interest which had accrued up to the date of redemption. The judicial managers, as agents, could not be in a better position than their principal was. I was surprised by the application. I am astonished by their appeal. It is wrong to use the assets of a company which is already in financial difficulty to pursue unsustainable legal proceedings.Outcome:Order accordingly.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
