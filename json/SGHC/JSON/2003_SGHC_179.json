        "Decision of the court": "10        InAbdul Rahim v Ling How Doong & Ors[1994] 2 SLR 668, Warren LH Khoo J pointed out that the rights of a member of an association of persons are regulated by contract and where an election is not in order, a member’s right is adversely affected.  Thus, in appropriate cases, the courts have declared elections for committee members of associations null and void on the ground of irregularities in the election process.  However, it must be borne in mind that it has been reiterated on innumerable occasions that a declaratory judgment is a discretionary remedy (see, for instance, the decision of the Court of Appeal inSalijah bte Ab Lateh v Mohd Irwan bin Abdullah[1996] 2 SLR 201) and factors such as inordinate delay may deprive the claimant of a declaratory judgment.  InThe Declaratory Judgment,3rded, edited by Lord Woolf and Jeremy Woolf, the authors, while referring to some of the factors which may be taken into account to determine whether the discretion ought to be exercised in favour of the applicant, stated as follows at p 135: This discretion is employed, as it was originally employed with regard to all equitable remedies, primarily to do justice in the particular case before the court.  It is wide enough to allow the court to take into account most objections and defences available in equitable proceedings. 11        In numerous cases, defences available in equitable proceedings were relied upon for denying a plaintiff the declaration sought.  For instance, inEverett v Griffiths[1924] 1 KB 941, McCardie J took into account the motives of the claimant and inHogg v Scott[1949] KB 759, Cassels J assumed that undue delay was another ground on which the claim in question could be dismissed.  In Malaysia, the question of undue delay as a ground for refusing to grant a declaration or an injunction has been considered on several occasions.  For instance, inPeriasamy s/o Karuppan & Ors v National Union of Plantation Workers & Ors[1975] 2 MLJ 108, one of the reasons for dismissing an application by members of a trade union, the National Union of Plantation Workers, for an injunction to restrain officials of the said union from taking or holding or remaining in office as executive council members on the ground that they had not been validly elected was that there had been inordinate delay on the plaintiffs’ part.  This was because the application to challenge the validity of the election in question was instituted more than 2 years after the union officials had been elected. 12        Gan relied on the decision of Buttrose J inBernard Leow Kim Hoon v Malayan Airways/Qantas Airways Local Employees Union & Ors[1967] 1 MLJ 60.  In that case, where votes for office bearers of a trade union were cast by members who were disqualified from voting, the election of the said office bearers was nullified.  However, it must be noted that in that case, the plaintiff had acted swiftly to challenge the results of the election in question. On 13thApril 1966, less than one week after the election of the office bearers, the plaintiff had obtained an interim injunction to restrain the said office bearers from taking office as members of the executive committee of the union and on 18thApril 1966, the plaintiff’s application for the interim injunction to remain in force until the trial of the action or until further order was heard by Buttrose J. 13        The circumstances in the present case are very different from those inBernard Leow Kim Hoon v Malayan Airways/Qantas Airways Local Employees Union & Ors.While the plaintiff in that case instituted legal proceedings within one week of the election, Gan instituted his action to nullify the election of SSTA’s management committee almost one year after the election results were announced on 16 December 2001.  It ought to be noted that as the present committee members were elected for a term of two years in December 2001, a new election is due in four months’ time.  The management committee is currently serving the 20thmonth of its term of office of 24 months.  The defendants’ counsel, Mr Raymond Lye, rightly pointed out that the management committee has made innumerable decisions and entered into many bargains where positions of the contracting parties have been irretrievably altered.  He added that if the election of 16 December 2001 is nullified at this late stage of the management committee’s term of office, there would be immeasurable difficulty for SSTA, which represents 700 members, who serve thousands of students in Singapore. 14        Gan’s failure to furnish a satisfactory explanation for his inordinate delay in instituting an action to challenge the validity of the election of 16 December 2001 undermined his case. As he had consulted his solicitors about the elections by 20 December 2001, he had no excuse whatsoever for instituting this action in November 2002.  After taking all circumstances into account, including Gan’s inordinate delay in instituting this action, I dismiss his application for a declaratory order that the election of members of SSTA’s management committee on 16 December 2001 is null and void.   In view of this, the question of restraining the 2ndto 22nddefendants from acting or holding themselves out as members of SSTA’s management committee does not arise. 15        The defendants are entitled to costs."
