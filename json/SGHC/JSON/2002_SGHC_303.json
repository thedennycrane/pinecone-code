        "The prosecution’s case": "2        The prosecution’s\n\nversion of events was as follows: on 1 February 2002 at 10.30 a.m., district judge Daphne\n\nHong (‘DJ Hong’) was hearing a summons-in-chambers in Chamber E of the Family\n\nand Juvenile Courts Building concerning an application by Pius’s ex-wife for a\n\nvariation of some of the orders made on ancillary issues pursuant to their divorce. While\n\nMs Halijah, who was acting for Pius’s ex-wife, was replying to Pius’s\n\nsubmission, Pius suddenly got up from his seat and walked to the public door. This was\n\nobserved by DJ Hong who wondered what Pius was doing as the hearing had not ended. After\n\nspending about three seconds at the door, Pius turned around and approached Ms Halijah. He\n\nangrily accused her of intending to destroy him. Saying that he was not afraid to die,\n\nPius gave Ms Halijah a few slaps to the face, followed with punches to her face and head.\n\nDJ Hong pressed the emergency button while telling him to stop assaulting Ms Halijah. Pius\n\nstopped after delivering a few more punches. He then took two steps towards DJ Hong who\n\ntold him to stop. Pius did so while reiterating that he was not afraid to die. After\n\npausing, Pius returned to Ms Halijah and resumed punching her on the face. In the two\n\nseries of attacks, Pius inflicted seven to ten blows on Ms Halijah’s face.3        DJ Hong then tried to leave\n\nthe chamber to seek assistance but found that the public door was locked. She released the\n\nlock and proceeded to Chamber F where she asked district judge Shobha Nair (‘DJ\n\nShobha’) to call for the police. On her way back to her chambers, DJ Hong saw Pius in\n\nthe public waiting area shouting away. Back in her chambers, she saw magistrate Lim Hui\n\nMin (‘Magistrate Lim’) with Ms Halijah and noticed that the latter had sustained\n\nbruises. Subsequently, the police arrived and Pius was taken into custody.4        On the same day some two\n\nhours later, Dr Caroline Low who runs the Family Court Clinic for victims of spousal abuse\n\nexamined Ms Halijah. Her clinical examination revealed that Ms Halijah’s left eye was\n\nvery swollen. There was also tenderness on palpation around the eye socket and on the left\n\nside of the nose. The conjunctiva was infected. As Dr Low suspected a fracture, she sent\n\nMs Halijah for an x-ray. The x-ray report of Dr K. Param stated that there was a suspected\n\nlower fracture in the left orbital floor. Three days later, Ms Halijah consulted Dr Jerry\n\nTan, an eye surgeon for a second opinion on her injuries. She was found to have swollen\n\nand bruised upper and lower eyelids of her left eye which were injuries consistent with a\n\nheavy blow to the left eye and orbit. Subsequently, when Dr Jerry Tan became aware of the\n\nx-ray report, he sent Ms Halijah for a Computer Tomography Imaging (CT scan). The CT scan\n\ndone by Dr See Toh Cheong Wah revealed that she had sustained a fracture of the lamina\n\npapyracea in her left eye. Based on the clinical findings as well as the CT scan report\n\nand the Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) report, Dr Tan confirmed that there was such a\n\nfracture. He further stated that this fracture was likely to have been caused caused by a\n\nblunt object such as a fist.",
        "The appellant’s case": "5        During the hearing before\n\nDJ Hong, Pius had made an offer to settle the issue brought up by the application but Ms\n\nHalijah said \"No\" to his offer. Pius testified that at this point of time, he\n\nfelt a gush of blood rushing through his brain. He protested that Ms Halijah had made this\n\nsame offer in writing. When asked by DJ Hong, Ms Halijah again said \"No\". This\n\ncaused Pius to become very angry. His version of events was that he stood up and walked\n\nalong the side of the table, looking for the letter which contained the offer. DJ Hong was\n\nlooking down. Pius then smacked Ms Halijah with his left hand while looking at DJ Hong. Ms\n\nHalijah did not make a sound. Pius then used his right hand to thump the table. It was\n\nthen that DJ Hong looked up. Pius uttered, \"Is this justice? I want my money. There\n\nis no justice. I have tried to kill myself. I am not afraid to die. Do you want me to kill\n\nmyself?\"6        Just as Ms Halijah was\n\nletting out a moaning sound, Pius once again smacked her while still keeping his focus on\n\nthe judge. This time, DJ Hong saw the smack and tried to activate the panic button. Pius\n\nthen went to the public door. He looked through the glass panel in the door as he was\n\nafraid that the police would be rushing in. When he did not see any policemen, he walked\n\nforward. DJ Hong walked passed him on the way out of the chamber to go to the adjourning\n\nchamber.7        Pius then walked to Ms\n\nHalijah. While scolding her for causing him so much trouble, he used his right hand to\n\nknock her head. Ms Halijah screamed very loudly, which apparently caused Pius to become so\n\nfrightened that he walked to the back of the room. The judge’s door then opened and\n\ntwo women entered. Pius told one of them to apologise on his behalf to DJ Hong for causing\n\nher distress and that he was not angry with her. After that he left the chamber. At the\n\nfoyer, he told his family members what had happened. Eventually, Pius was arrested by the\n\npolice and brought to the Central Police Station.",
        "The appeal against conviction": "8        Pius submitted that the\n\nprosecution had failed to prove conclusively and beyond a reasonable doubt that there was\n\na fracture of the lamina paprycea based on medical evidence. He thus contended that he\n\nought to be charged under s 323 of the Penal Code for voluntarily causing hurt, instead of\n\ns 325 as no grievous hurt had been caused.9        This same submission had\n\nbeen put before the trial judge below who had carefully considered the matter. In\n\nparagraph 54 of the trial judge’s grounds of decision, he stated that:The Court was satisfied that there was ample evidence to prove that the\n\n    lamina papyracea is a bone. The accused’s challenge was devoid of merit.… he challenged the medical conclusion that the lamina papyracea\n\n    had been fractured. From the CT scan, Dr See Toh made the finding that there was a\n\n    fracture of the lamina papyracea. He also said that it was a blow out fracture and not a\n\n    hair-line fracture as the lamina papyracea is the weakest part of the ethmoidal bone. His\n\n    finding was based on 2 features which he observed. The first feature is that there was a\n\n    break in the continuity of the medial wall of the left orbit or socket. In the normal\n\n    state, the outline of the orbit is a continuous line and oval shape. The second feature is\n\n    that there were soft tissues (fat or connective tissues) protruding from the left orbit\n\n    into the air cells of the adjacent ethmoidal sinus when there should not be any tissue in\n\n    the sinus which is a group of cells lying beside the orbit. In this respect, Dr Tan stated\n\n    that for the orbital tissues to enter the sinus, there had to be a break in the bone plus\n\n    a break in the lining in the bone. It was the accused’s contention that \"the\n\n    lamina papyracea can never be fractured or there is never such a case known without\n\n    orbital floor also having a fracture.\" In line with his stand, the accused asked Dr\n\n    Jerry Tan if there was any special reason why the floor of the orbit did not fracture in\n\n    this case. The surgeon’s reply was this : \"I know you can have fracture on the\n\n    medial wall without fracture of the floor. There are theories (conjectures) why this\n\n    happens.\" Dr Tan had in fact already stated in examination-in-chief that it is\n\n    possible to have a fracture of the lamina papyracea without a fracture of the orbital\n\n    floor. His evidence was supported by the testimony of Dr See Toh who stated that \"the\n\n    lamina papyracea can be fractured without a corresponding fracture to the interior borders\n\n    of the orbit.\" Therefore, the accused’s assertion ran contrary to the medical\n\n    evidence and must be rejected.Pius argued, however, that there were seven other doctors who failed to\n\ndetect a fracture in the lamina paprycea. I noted that none of these doctors in fact did a\n\nCT scan on Ms Halijah. One of the prosecution witness Dr Dharambir Singh Sethi (‘Dr\n\nDharambir’), senior consultant of ENT at the Singapore General Hospital gave expert\n\nevidence that a CT Scan is usually necessary to confirm or exclude a fracture, and that an\n\nendoscopic examination could not do the same. This was not disputed by Pius, nor did he\n\nadduce any expert evidence to the contrary. The Court of Appeal inSaeng-Un Udom v PP[2001] 3 SLR 1held that:the court should not, when confronted with expert evidence, which is\n\n    unopposed and appears not to be obviously lacking in defensibility, reject it nevertheless\n\n    and prefer to draw its own inferences. While the court is not obliged to accept expert\n\n    evidence by reason only that it is unchallenged… if the court finds that the evidence\n\n    is based on sound grounds and supported by basic facts, it can do little else than to\n\n    accept the evidence.Following this case, I found no reason to reject the expert evidence\n\ngiven by Dr Dharambir, and since the CT scan did in fact show that there was a fracture\n\nand there were competent, independent and reliable doctor-witnesses who testified to the\n\nsame, I found no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that the prosecution had\n\nproven that there was a fracture of the lamina paprycea beyond reasonable doubt.10        It was impossible to\n\naccept Pius’s submission that he did not have the necessary intention to cause\n\ngrievous hurt when he had delivered seven to ten punches in two series of attacks to the\n\nface of Ms Halijah. The element of intention which must be established to satisfy a charge\n\nunder s 325 of the Penal Code, as elaborated inPP v Sng Siew Ngoh[1996] 1 SLR 143, is that the accused must intend to cause or know that he was likely to cause grievous\n\nhurt. Anyone must know that punching someone repeatedly would likely lead to grievous\n\nhurt. It cannot be an excuse to say that he had under-estimated his own strength and that\n\nhe had only expected simple hurt to be caused. If one makes a decision to punch another\n\nperson, he bears the risk of causing grievous, rather than just simple, hurt.11        I also rejected\n\nPius’s defences of grave and sudden provocation and accepted the trial judge’s\n\nfindings on this point. First of all, there was no grave and sudden provocation. Ms\n\nHalijah’s act of lodging a caveat on the matrimonial flat and her refusal to accept\n\nPius’s offer of settlement at the summons-in-chambers hearing in order to first get\n\nher client’s instructions were all part of her professional duty to act in the best\n\ninterests of her client. There was no evidence of a personal vendetta as imagined by Pius.\n\nThe defence of grave and sudden provocation is not meant to protect people who are\n\nexceptionally pugnacious, bad-tempered or over-sensitive. It would be ridiculous to extend\n\nthe defence by classifying legal steps taken by the opponent’s lawyer as acts\n\nsufficient to cause grave and sudden provocation, as it would expose all the lawyers to\n\nthe risk of assault whenever they act in a manner adverse to the interests of their\n\nopponent.12        Moreover, Pius’s\n\nactions pointed to the conclusion that he had not lost self-control. He himself had\n\ntestified that, when Ms Halijah turned down his offer (which was the alleged act of\n\nprovocation), he stood up and started looking for the letter in which Ms Halijah herself\n\nhad made the same offer. This sounded more like a man with the presence of mind to look\n\nfor proof to substantiate his assertion that there was really such an offer, than a man\n\nwho had lost self-control. He also claimed that when he was hitting Ms Halijah, he was\n\nlooking at DJ Hong as he wanted to show his frustration with Ms Halijah’s conduct as\n\nwell as that of the judge. Further, there was evidence that he was the only person who\n\ncould have locked the chamber’s doors. These had to be the deliberate acts of a man\n\nin full control of his mental faculties. Because the credit of two of the defence\n\nwitnesses were impeached, no weight could be given to their testimonies that Pius appeared\n\nedgy and anxious after the incident. I thus held that the trial judge had come to the\n\ncorrect and logical conclusion in dismissing the defence of grave and sudden provocation.13        For the reasons given\n\nabove, I was satisfied that the elements of the offence had been fully made out and\n\ndismissed the appellant’s appeal against his conviction.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "14        Pius was sentenced to six\n\nyears’ imprisonment. He could not be caned as he was 51 years of age. There were many\n\nespecially aggravating factors in this case, however, which cried out for a heavier\n\nsentence.15        Pius is a dangerous man.\n\nHe was not afraid to carry out a pre-meditated attack on a lawyer in the courts or to\n\nintimidate a judge. He had obviously no respect for the law. The extent of his\n\ndetermination to carry out the crime was shown by the fact that he had first locked the\n\ndoor before the attack to prevent his victim from escaping, as well as the fact that he\n\ncame back to punch his victim a second time even after DJ Hong told him to stop. He\n\nhimself had the audacity to admit that his intention was to generate publicity and make\n\nhis point. He also testified that he wanted DJ Hong to see him attack Ms Halijah to show\n\nhis unhappiness with the both of them. Worst of all, he intimidated the district judge by\n\ncoming towards her when she told him to stop the attack on Ms Halijah. I have checked the\n\nrecords and there had never been an attack like this in our courts before. This was an\n\nunprecedented act of violence coupled with contempt of the court. It would be making a\n\nmockery of our system of law and the courts of our land to let him get away with a lighter\n\npunishment.16        Moreover, he showed no\n\nremorse right up to the end. During his mitigation plea, he stated that \"I do not\n\napologise nor regret my action…\" and then went on to justify his actions in the\n\nname of defending his family, his reputation, and his dignity and honour. During the\n\ntrial, he launched attacks on the dignity of the majority of the witnesses including that\n\nof the district judges. In the appeal before me, he continued to claim justification for\n\nhis actions. Instead of trying to turn over a new leaf, he chose to blame others for his\n\n\"misfortune\". Before me, he even had the breathtaking impertinence to tell me\n\nthat he would explain his views confidentially to me in the privacy of my own chambers. A\n\nheavy sentence should serve as a wake-up call to him to re-examine his own conduct and\n\nattitude. Society has to be protected from a violent and dangerous man like Pius who has\n\ncomplete disregard for the law.17        I was mindful of the fact\n\nthat, followingPP v Lee Meow Sim Jenny[1993] 3 SLR 885, my powers when sitting in\n\nan appellate capacity hearing appeals from the district courts, are limited by the power\n\nwhich a District Court possesses. However, the proviso to s 11(3) of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Code (Cap 68) empowers a district court to sentence a person to imprisonment for\n\na term not exceeding ten years by reason of any previous conviction or of his antecedents\n\nprovided that the court records its reason for so doing. Unlike the proviso to s 11(5)\n\nwhich limits the punishment which a magistrate’s court can award to \"the full\n\npunishment authorised by law for the offence, for which that person has been\n\nconvicted\" there is no such restriction on the district court’s powers under the\n\ns 11(3) proviso. Moreover, on a purposive interpretation, it is unlikely that Parliament\n\nintended the restriction under s 11(5) to be read into the proviso to s 11(3), since\n\notherwise there would be extremely few cases which would warrant its use at all. Most\n\nimportantly, there were very special and unique reasons in this case which call for an\n\nexercise of the s 11(3) proviso. I was unable to think of another situation which\n\nwarranted a more severe punishment. We were dealing here with a man whose contemptuous\n\nconduct had outraged the dignity of our courts. He was lucky to escape caning only because\n\nof his age.18        As Pius has had previous\n\nconvictions – in 1986, he was fined for providing public entertainment without a\n\nlicence, and in 1999 he was imprisoned and disqualified from holding or obtaining a\n\ndriving licence for five years for driving while under disqualification – I increased\n\nhis sentence to ten years’ imprisonment pursuant to the proviso to s 11(3) in light\n\nof the aggravating factors stated above.",
        "Conclusion": "19        For the reasons above, I\n\ndismissed the appeal against conviction and enhanced Pius’s sentence to ten\n\nyears’ imprisonment.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
