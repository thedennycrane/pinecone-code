        "Plaintiffs’/appellants’ arguments": "16 The plaintiffs caused to be issued the protective writ against the\n\ndefendants for two reasons: first to preserve their claim against the time-bar and\n\nsecondly to enable the plaintiffs to negotiate and obtain security. After issuing the writ\n\non 19 June 1998, the plaintiffs did not attempt to serve the writ since they had taken\n\nsteps to commence arbitration proceedings as they were entitled to, under the terms of the\n\ncharterparty.17 Furthermore, during the interim period between 19 June 1998 and 16\n\nJune 2000, the plaintiffs’ solicitors had been corresponding with the\n\ndefendants’ P & I Club on various issues including security, legal proceedings\n\nand arbitration. On 11 March 1999, the defendants, through their P & I Club, confirmed\n\nthat they would be appointing solicitors to accept service of process. The plaintiffs\n\ntherefore took the view, not unreasonably, that they need not serve the writ directly on\n\nthe vessel as this would negate the agreement reached with the defendants’ P & I\n\nClub. However, since the defendants had not appointed solicitors to accept service of the\n\nwrit even by 18 June 1999, it became necessary for them to renew the writ for a further\n\nperiod.",
        "Defendants’/respondents’ arguments": "18 The contentions of the defendants are best stated in their\n\ncounsel’s own words. Paragraphs 11 to 13 of his submission read as follows:11. The Plaintiffs in any event failed to disclose in their affidavit\n\n  for renewal of the Writ, anything about the arbitration proceedings or how it allegedly\n\n  affected their judgment not to take steps to serve the Writ on the \"ANTARES V\".\n\n  The Defendants maintain that this was non disclosure of a material fact in the ex-parte\n\n  application to renew the Writ, if the Plaintiffs’ allegations were true, which is\n\n  denied.12. Further, the Plaintiffs had failed to disclose in their affidavit\n\n  for the renewal of the Writ, the following material facts:(i) The Plaintiffs’ claim would be time barred but for the renewal\n\n    of the Writ.(ii) That the Plaintiffs had not taken any steps to serve the Writ on\n\n    the \"ANTARES V\" during the initial 12 months validity period of the Writ, and if\n\n    they had done so, there were two occasions on which the vessel had called at Singapore\n\n    during this period providing ample opportunity to serve the Writ.13. The law is well established that a Plaintiff should take steps to\n\n  serve an admiralty writ by keeping a shipwatch on the Defendant vessel from the time of\n\n  issuing the writ to effect service within the initial validity period of the writ and\n\n  unless this was done and the Defendant vessels had not called within the jurisdiction,\n\n  there is no good reason to renew the writ. The law is well established that a renewal of a\n\n  writ would not normally be granted, if the effect of it would be to deprive the Defendant\n\n  of suit time limitation.",
        "Findings and conclusion": "19 A preliminary aspect requires mention first. In order to parry a\n\ncriticism as to why the defendants took more than 9 months since the date of the letter of\n\nundertaking, to take out the application to set aside the writ, the defendants’\n\ncounsel hastened to explain that although his firm’s name was mentioned in the letter\n\nof undertaking given by the P & I Club on 9 September 1999, his firm was in fact not\n\naware of it until the writ was served on them on 16 June 2000. This assertion, to use a\n\nless formal expression, did not cut much ice with me. In my view, if what the counsel said\n\nwas correct, then it would appear that the Club themselves had been extremely leisurely\n\nover the defendants’ legal rights leading me to infer that time element which they\n\nwere attempting to highlight in this appeal was the least of their concerns.20 Reverting to the issues before me, I was mindful first of all, of\n\nthe principles enunciated by the House of Lords inThe \"Myrto\"[1987] AC 597 as to the manner in which courts ought to exercise their discretion when\n\ndeciding whether the validity of a writ should be extended. In short, the law as stated by\n\nthe law lords was that it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to serve the writ promptly;\n\nthere must be a good reason for the grant of an extension; and that a ‘good\n\nreason’ cannot be defined and would depend on the circumstances of each case.21 The local decision ofThe Lircay[1997] 2 SLR 669echoed the same principle. InThe Lircay, the court further observed at page\n\n674G-H:In the end, it was the exercise ofdiscretionby the court which\n\n  determined whether the writ was to be extended. In the exercise of thatdiscretion–discretionthat was undefined – the judge was entitled to have regard\n\n  to the balance ofhardshipbetween the parties as a relevant matter to be taken\n\n  into account in extending the writ’s validity on anex parteapplication and\n\n  further that in doing so, the court may well need to consider whether allowing an\n\n  extension will causeprejudiceto the defendants in all the circumstances of the\n\n  case.22 InThe Lircaythe court also dealt with the issue of\n\nmaterial non-disclosure in the affidavit supporting the application for renewal of the\n\nwrit. The Court observed that while a very stringent requirement for full disclosure had\n\nbeen laid down by the courts over the years in relation to Anton Piller orders, this was\n\nnot the case for other ex-parte applications. And the Court went on to hold that the\n\nclaimants’ non-disclosure of an additional reason, i.e. the agreement to defer\n\nservice, was not fatal to the renewal of the writ in all the circumstances of the case.\n\nThe court also held in that case that since the claimants’ application for renewal of\n\nthe writ was commenced and granted before the expiry of the validity of the writ, although\n\nafter the period of limitation had expired, the defendants did not have any accrued right\n\nof limitation.23 Having reviewed the events chronicled in the parties’\n\nsubmissions and affidavits, I came to the conclusion that the plaintiffs had justifiable\n\nand good reasons for not serving the writ until they had received communication from the\n\ndefendants that their solicitors would accept service of process. One of the\n\ndefendants’ main contentions was that the plaintiffs’ failure to serve the writ\n\non the vessel when it called at Singapore on two occasions within the first period of its\n\nvalidity (i.e. between 19 June 1998 and 18 June 1999), precluded them from seeking a\n\nfurther renewal of the writ. In my determination, although the authorities lay stress on\n\nthe aspect that the plaintiffs should have taken steps to serve the writ by keeping a\n\nshipwatch on the defendants’ vessel during the initial validity period of the writ,\n\nthe authorities referred to, equally emphasize that the overriding consideration for the\n\ncourts in determining issues of this nature must be the balance of justice between the\n\nparties and that circumstances peculiar to each case must be taken into account as well.24 In the case at hand, first of all when the plaintiffs suggested the\n\nidea of arbitration, the defendants were not inimical to the proposal. Secondly, when the\n\nplaintiffs suggested negotiated settlement or court process in lieu of arbitration, the\n\ndefendants again did not raise any objection. This was evident from the defendants’ P\n\n& I Club’s letter of 11 March 1999 – in reply to the plaintiffs’\n\nsolicitors’ letter of 9 March 1999 - where they said that solicitors should be\n\ninstructed on the defendants’ and the P & I Club’s behalf although\n\nregrettably such appointment did not take place for quite a while. The nomination of\n\nsolicitors was further expressly stated in the P & I Club in their letter of\n\nundertaking of 9 September 1999. From all the correspondence exchanged between the\n\nparties, one feature was very clear, that was, that parties were earnestly engaged in\n\nnegotiations, albeit sporadically, during the material time. At any rate, in my view\n\ninasmuch as the defendants’ P & I Club had been demonstrably laid back in\n\nrelation to the time element, the defendants could not be said to have suffered prejudice\n\nin respect of the benefit of the limitation period since (as was also the case inThe\n\nLircay) no such benefit had yet accrued to the defendants, given that the\n\napplication to renew the validity of the writ was made before it expired. Another\n\ninescapable aspect of the case was that the defendants’ P & I Club could not have\n\nbeen blind-sided to the fact that the writ must have been renewed beyond the extension\n\nperiod granted by them. Had it not been for such an assumption and had it not been for the\n\nP & I Club’s desire to reach a negotiated settlement, the Club would not have\n\nprovided the letter of undertaking on 9 September 1999.25 I was also mindful that before March 1999, the vessel had called\n\ninto Singapore twice. The body of learning referred to me, no doubt underscores the\n\nprinciple that just because negotiations were afoot and in train, they by themselves,\n\nwould not constitute a good reason to extend the period of validity of a writ. InWaddon\n\nv Whitecroft-Scovill Ltd[1988] 1 All ER 996, the House of Lords reiterated the\n\nrule that the showing of a good reason for failure to serve the writ during its original\n\nperiod of validity, was a necessary step for the grant of an extension. Although it has\n\nbeen said that negotiations between the parties alone do not amount to good reason to\n\nextend the period of validity of the writ and that the plaintiffs should protect his\n\nposition by issuing as well as serving the writ on the defendants, I do not think that\n\nthis is meant to be applied in a rigid and inflexible manner. The fact is that an attempt\n\non the plaintiffs’ part to serve the writ would in all likelihood have ruined the\n\nprospects of settlement, or at least would have been a set-back to negotiation process.\n\nThe court should therefore take into account all the circumstances which may alter the\n\ncomplexion of each case. InKun Kay Hong v Tan Teo Huat[1985] 1 MLJ 404,\n\nthe Singapore Court of Appeal held that the request by the solicitors’ underwriters\n\nto the plaintiff’s solicitors to postpone service pending investigations did amount\n\nto good reasons for not serving the writ during its validity period. The authorities also\n\nindicate that the defendants’ conduct in causing or contributing to the delay may be\n\ntaken into account by the court in exercising its discretion in such cases. All said, at\n\nthe end of the day the overriding consideration for the courts, as mentioned by me earlier\n\nmust be the balance of justice between the parties. This point seems to have received\n\njudicial approval inJones v Jones & Anor[1970] 2 QB 576 where Sachs LJ\n\nat 587C commented that the climate of opinion is ‘moving more towards an\n\nascertainment of how lies the balance of justice between the parties’.26 In the circumstances, having considered all the learning referred to\n\nme by the defendants’ counsel including the principles articulated by the courts inThe\n\nBerny[1979] 1 QB 80,The \"Big Beacher\"[1984] 2 MLJ 4,The\n\n\"Union Hodeidah\"[1987] 2 MLJ 561,The Official Receiver,\n\nLiquidator of Jason Textile Industries Pte Ltd v QBE Insurance (International) Ltd[1989] 1 MLJ 1andSaris v Westminster Transports SAAndKestrel\n\nMarine Ltd[1994] 1 LLR 115, I concluded that the plaintiffs had amply satisfied\n\nthe court with sufficiently good reason for not serving the writ during its initial\n\nvalidity. In my view, the fact of the negotiations between the parties and the way P &\n\nI Club conducted their correspondence most certainly swung the balance of justice in the\n\nplaintiffs’ favour. Given the facts, the plaintiffs’ omission to state the\n\nbackground facts in their affidavit in support of their application to renew the validity\n\nof the writ, was not in my opinion fatal to their application. Next, their omission to\n\nmention the aspect of the vessel calling into Singapore during the initial validity period\n\nas well as their lapse in not making reference to the contemplated arbitral steps in their\n\naffidavit for renewal, were not such as to warrant the setting aside of the renewal\n\ngranted.27 Consequently, the plaintiffs’ appeal was allowed and the order\n\nof court dated 13 October 2000 was set aside. The costs of the appeal and costs below was\n\nfixed at $5,000 payable by the defendants to the plaintiffs.Sgd:MPH RUBINJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
