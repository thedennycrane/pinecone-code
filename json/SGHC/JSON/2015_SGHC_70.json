        "Introduction": "1       On\n29 January 2015, I gave oral judgment (“the Oral Judgment”) on the\nissue of ancillaries in divorce proceedings between the plaintiff\n(“the Wife”) and the defendant (“the Husband”). A copy of the Oral\nJudgment is attached for easy reference. The Wife has filed an appeal\nagainst my entire decision. I elaborate on my reasons below.",
        "Custody of the daughter and\ncare and control": "2       There\nare two children of the marriage: a son who is more than 21 years\nof age and a daughter who is below 21 years of age. 3       Neither\nparty sought any order for custody or care and control of the son.\nAs for the daughter, the parties agreed to joint custody over her. 4       The\nWife also asked for care and control of the daughter. The Husband\neventually accepted that the daughter preferred to stay with the Wife.\nHence, I granted both parties joint custody over the daughter and care\nand control of the daughter to the Wife with reasonable access to\nthe Husband. Accordingly, the question of custody and care and control\nof the daughter should no longer be in issue and the Wife’s notice\nof appeal should not be against my entire decision on the ancillaries.",
        "Division of matrimonial assets": "5       The\nparties agreed that the value of the matrimonial assets total $23,915,000. 6       The\nHusband held $23,055,000 worth of the assets. This included a 50%\ninterest in a Housing and Development Board (“HDB”) flat. It was agreed\nthat the 50% interest was worth $195,000. 7       The\nWife held $860,000 worth of the assets including the other 50% interest\nin the HDB flat. 8       The\nWife asked for 60% of the matrimonial assets if she was given care\nand control of the daughter and 50% if she did not have such care\nand control. I did not see why care and control of the daughter\nshould be a reason for giving the Wife a higher portion of the matrimonial\nassets. That was a matter for maintenance. Furthermore, as mentioned\nbelow, the Husband would be the one who would provide for the children’s\nfuture. 9       The\nHusband offered to give the Wife the HDB flat and a private apartment\nfree from encumbrances and $1 million cash. In addition, she would\nkeep the assets held by her. This would work out to $3,381,668 (ie, about 14.14% worth of the matrimonial\nassets): S/NoItemsValue(a)HDB flat$   550,000(b)An apartment in Bukit Regency$1,200,000(c)Cash$1,000,000(d)The Wife’s own assets (excluding her share in the HDB flat)$   631,668Total:$3,381,668   10     It\nshould be noted that in the above table, the Husband had used $631,668\nas the value of assets held by the Wife but this excluded her 50% share\nof the HDB flat. The parties eventually agreed that the value of\nassets held by the Wife, excluding the HDB flat, was $665,000. 11     The\nmain dispute was the portion which each party was entitled to of the\ntotal matrimonial assets. As stated above, the Wife wanted 50% to\n60%. Based on the revised figures of the Wife’s assets, the Husband’s\nproposal would work out to about 14.28% of the total matrimonial\nassets. 12     As\nstated in[9]and[11]of the Oral\nJudgment, I took into account various factors when I granted the\nWife 20% of the matrimonial assets. I elaborate below. 13     Although\n20% of the matrimonial assets for the Wife may appear low for a\n28 year marriage, a large portion of the assets held by the Husband\nare not liquid. These are shares in a private company which he built\nup. The value of the shares is $10,314,191.20 which is a substantial\nportion of the $23,055,000 worth of assets he holds,ie, about 44.74%. 14     Secondly,\nhe had stated that he was trying to involve the children in the\nbusiness and in any event, he would provide for their future. I\naccepted his assurance. Indeed, the Wife did not dispute these assertions\neven though she alleged that the Husband is pursuing a relationship\nwith another woman and he is likely to remarry. 15     Thirdly,\nin my view, it was the Husband who built up the business. I did\nnot accept that the Wife helped him much in his business. According\nto the Husband, he continued to build up the business after he discovered\nin 2007 that she had squandered or lost in gambling various sums\nof money totalling $700,000. While the Wife disputed his allegations,\nthe Husband’s elaboration of the contradictions in her explanations\nmade it clear that she was not to be believed. It is not necessary\nfor me to repeat here the Husband’s arguments about her contradictions. 16     The\nHusband alleged and I accepted that her gambling habit weighed on\nthe Husband’s mind and the Husband could no longer rely on her to manage\ntheir finances which she had been doing before. 17     The\nabsence of her assistance to manage their finances and the fact that\nshe had lost substantial sums of money as he was building up the business\nwas material. The Husband said that the fact that she squandered\na large sum of money in 2007 almost wiped out his hard earned money. 18     There\nwas also the real danger that the Wife would lose much of what was\nto be granted to her to the detriment of the children. While one\ncould argue that the money would be hers to lose anyway, such an\nargument would appear counter-intuitive when a court is considering\nthe interests of the children as well as the parties. Perhaps that\nis why the Wife did not specifically assert that argument. 19     In\nbalancing the interests of the parties and the children, I was of\nthe view that 20% for the Wife was fair. That amounted to $4,783,000\nwhich is still a large sum and more than enough for her to live\ncomfortably. Indeed, that amount includes: (a)a\nHDB flat;(b)a semi-detached house;(c)cash of $968,000 from the Husband\n(which was erroneously stated as $1,001,332 in [11(c)] of the Oral\nJudgment); and(d)the Wife’s own assets of $665,000\n(which was erroneously stated as $631,668 in [11(d)] of the Oral\nJudgment).Both the HDB flat and the\nsemi-detached house were granted to her free from encumbrances.Maintenance for the Wife20     I\nordered the Husband to pay $2,000 per month for the Wife’s maintenance\nwith effect from 1 February 2015. This was the amount he had been\ngiving her. My reasons are stated in[15]–[25]of the Oral Judgment which I\nwill not repeat.Maintenance for the daughter21     I\nordered the Husband to pay another $2,000 per month for the daughter’s\nmaintenance and certain specific expenses, including her school fees,\nwhich I set out in the Oral Judgment. This was effective from 1 February\n2015. My reasons for the quantum are stated in[27]–[30]of the Oral\nJudgment which I will not repeat. However, I will stress that the specific\nexpenses which the Husband is to pay for already include some items\nwhich the Wife used to increase her claim for maintenance for the daughter\nto $4,000 per month.AnnexORAL JUDGMENTCustody\nof the daughter and care and control1       There\nare two children from the marriage. The son is more than 21 years\nof age and neither party sought any order for custody or care and control\nof the son.2       I\ngrant joint custody to the husband and to the wife over the daughter.3       I\ngrant to the wife care and control of the daughter with reasonable access\nto the husband.Division\nof matrimonial assets4       The\nparties have agreed that the matrimonial assets total $23,915,000.5       The\nhusband holds $23,055,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in\nan HDB flat in Jurong West.6       The\nwife holds $860,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in the HDB\nflat.7       The\nwife asked for 60% of the matrimonial assets if she is given care and\ncontrol of the daughter and 50% if she does not have such care and control.\nI do not see why care and control of the daughter should be a reason\nfor giving the wife a higher portion of the matrimonial assets.\nThat is a matter for maintenance and as mentioned below, the husband\nis the one who will provide for the children’s future.8       The\nhusband offered to give the wife the HDB flat and a private apartment\nfree from encumbrances and $1 million cash. In addition, she would\nkeep the assets held by her.

I have also\ntaken into account that she did lose substantial sums of money in\ngambling which the husband discovered in 2007. Her gambling habit\ncontinued to weigh on his mind and he could no longer trust her\nto manage their finances.(d)     I\naccept the husband’s assurance that he will provide for the children’s\nfuture even though the wife alleged that the husband is pursuing\na relationship with another woman and is likely to remarry.(e)     Also,\na large portion of the assets held by the husband are his shares\nin a private company. He will be allowed to keep those shares as\npart of the division of matrimonial assets but they are not liquid.10     The\nwife wanted to retain the HDB flat. She also asked for a semi-detached\nhouse at an address at Pavilion Place (“PP”) instead of a private apartment.\nThe house is the latest matrimonial home. She said she and the children\nare staying in it and the husband was not. The husband’s counsel said\nthat sometimes the husband stays at one of his other properties,ie, a condominium unit but he also does\nstay at PP. The relationship between husband and wife is strained.\nThe latest update from the husband’s counsel is that once (or twice)\na week, the husband stays at night with his mother and sister. As\nthe wife has care and control of the daughter and the son is also\nlikely to stay with the wife too, I will grant the matrimonial house\nat PP to the wife and take that into account in the division.11     In\nall the circumstances, I grant the wife 20% of $23,915,000 = $4,783,000\nas follows:S/NoItemsValue(a)HDB flat (free from encumbrances)$   550,000(b)Matrimonial home at PP (free from encumbrances)$2,600,000(c)Cash$1,001,332(d)Wife’s own assets (excluding her share in the HDB flat)$   631,668Total:$4,783,00012     The\nHDB flat and PP are granted to the wife free from emcumbrances and\nthe values stated above are on that basis. Therefore, the husband\nis to pay any outstanding loan secured by the HDB flat or PP. He\nis entitled to retain the other assets held by him. As for the cash\nto be paid to the wife, the husband is to pay $500,000 within one\nmonth from the date of this judgment and the balance within six\nmonths from the date of this judgment.13     The\nhusband is to vacate PP within six months from the date of this judgment\nor such other period as parties may agree to in writing.14     Parties\nare to bear their own solicitor’s costs for the transfer of the husband’s\ninterest in the HDB flat and in PP to the wife. Any stamp duty for each\ntransfer is to be borne by the wife.Maintenance\nfor the wife15     The\nwife sought lump sum maintenance calculated at $8,000 per month\nx 12 months x 17 years as orally clarified by her counsel. I see\nno reason to award her lump sum maintenance.16     On\nthe question of periodic monthly maintenance, the wife claimed that\nher monthly expenses are $8,900 per month although she calculated her\nclaim for lump sum maintenance based on a multiplier of $8,000 and not\n$8,900 per month. She also said that she had reduced her expenses\nfrom about $13,000 claimed in her first affidavit of means.17     The\nhusband submitted that the wife had claimed at one time that her expenses\namounted to $6,865.95 before she increased it to $8,900 per month.\nEven then, both claims included a monthly sum of $621 to pay the loan\nsecured by the HDB flat. As the husband was paying off that loan entirely,\nthe monthly payment would cease to apply.18     I\nnoted that the wife was charging work related expenses of about $720\nper month which should pertain to her income earning capacity instead.\nFurthermore, her second list of expenses contained expenses which were\neither not necessary or inflated. For example, she included $800\nper month for personal development which was vague and should not\nbe allowed. She claimed $500 per month for personal grooming such\nas physio treatment, spas and facials. This appeared excessive.19     Looking\nat the wife’s expenses in the round, I do not think that they exceed\n$6,500 per month.20     The\nfact that the husband can afford to give her more is in my view irrelevant.21     However,\nI note that the wife has not claimed the cost of purchasing a car.\nI presume this is because the husband has bought a BMW car recently for\nher. I am of the view that the husband’s obligation to provide the\nwife with a car is a continuing one and I leave it to the parties\nto try and agree as to how he is to do so.22     The\nhusband submitted that the wife was receiving the following:(a)Her own income as a real estate agent$2,000 per month(b)Rent from the HDB flat$2,800 per month(c)Cash from the husband as maintenance pursuant to the wife’s\nrequest in 2010$2,000 per monthTotal:$6,800 per month23     He\nsubmitted that the $6,800 was more than the wife’s original list\nof expenses after taking away the monthly payment for the HDB loan\nand he suggested that he continue paying her the $2,000 per month\nas maintenance for her.24     Although\nit was unclear whether the HDB flat was still being rented out,\nit is still an asset from which the wife may derive an income. Although the\nrental market may have softened, that is the risk associated with\nsuch an asset as the rental market may also improve. I use $2,800\nper month as the income earning capacity of that flat.25     The\nwife said she was earning an income of $2,000 per month as a real estate\nagent. While her income may be affected by a softening real estate market,\nthat is also the risk associated with the nature of her work and\nher income could also improve. Also, it is up to her to find alternative\nor additional income. I use $2,000 per month as her own income earning capacity.26     In\nthe circumstances, I order the husband to pay the wife $2,000 per month\nas maintenance for her expenses with effect from 1 February 2015. This\nis the amount which he has been giving to her and he is to continue\nto do so.Maintenance\nfor the daughter27     The\nwife’s allegation of expenses for the daughter was haphazard. In her\nfirst affidavit of means of 25 June 2013, she indicated at para\n15 that the expenses totalled $700 per month. In para 25, she claimed\n$3,000 per month for the daughter’s expenses. In the wife’s Updated\nAncillary Matters Fact and Position Sheet but said by her counsel\nto be filed on 11 April 2014 (undated), the wife stated that the\nchildren’s total monthly expenses was $1,050 per month. Then, in\nsubmissions before me, the wife was claiming $4,000 per month for\nthe daughter based on a list of alleged expenses.28     The\nhusband’s first affidavit of means indicated at para 14 that his expenses\nfor the daughter were $1,200 per month.29     The\nhusband submitted that the wife had asked for $3,000 per month for\nthe daughter’s expense and then increased her claim to $4,000 per month.\nHe offered $2,000 per month and he would also pay for the school fees\nof the daughter. He did not clarify whether this included some expenses like\ntuition for academic subjects and an alleged badminton coach fee\nand violin classes which were part of the wife’s submissions for\n$4,000 per month.30     I\norder the husband to give the wife $2,000 per month as maintenance for\nthe daughter with effect with 1 February 2015. In addition, he is\nto pay for her:(a)     school\nfees;(b)     any\noverseas trips for exchange programs;(c)     tuition\nfor academic subjects;(d)     violin\nclasses; and(e)     badminton\ncoach fee, where appropriate.Costs31     Each\nparty is to bear his/her own costs of the ancillaries.",

Division\nof matrimonial assets 4       The\nparties have agreed that the matrimonial assets total $23,915,000. 5       The\nhusband holds $23,055,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in\nan HDB flat in Jurong West. 6       The\nwife holds $860,000 of the assets including a 50% interest in the HDB\nflat. 7       The\nwife asked for 60% of the matrimonial assets if she is given care and\ncontrol of the daughter and 50% if she does not have such care and control.\nI do not see why care and control of the daughter should be a reason\nfor giving the wife a higher portion of the matrimonial assets.\nThat is a matter for maintenance and as mentioned below, the husband\nis the one who will provide for the children’s future. 8       The\nhusband offered to give the wife the HDB flat and a private apartment\nfree from encumbrances and $1 million cash. In addition, she would\nkeep the assets held by her. This would work out to $3,381,668 (ie, about\n14.14% of the matrimonial assets): S/NoItemsValue(a)HDB flat$   550,000(b)An apartment in Bukit Regency$1,200,000(c)Cash$1,000,000(d)The wife’s own assets (excluding her share in the HDB flat)$   631,668Total:$3,381,668   9       I\nhave taken into account: (a)     The\nlength of the marriage of about 28 years (from July 1985 to May\n2013) during which the parties raised two children. (b)     The\nhusband’s greater financial contributions and the wife’s greater\nnon-financial contributions in raising the children and taking care\nof the household (even if she did have a maid to help). (c)     However,\nI do not accept that the wife contributed much to the husband’s\nbusiness which was conducted through a private company. I have also\ntaken into account that she did lose substantial sums of money in\ngambling which the husband discovered in 2007. Her gambling habit\ncontinued to weigh on his mind and he could no longer trust her\nto manage their finances. (d)     I\naccept the husband’s assurance that he will provide for the children’s\nfuture even though the wife alleged that the husband is pursuing\na relationship with another woman and is likely to remarry. (e)     Also,\na large portion of the assets held by the husband are his shares\nin a private company. He will be allowed to keep those shares as\npart of the division of matrimonial assets but they are not liquid. 10     The\nwife wanted to retain the HDB flat. She also asked for a semi-detached\nhouse at an address at Pavilion Place (“PP”) instead of a private apartment.\nThe house is the latest matrimonial home. She said she and the children\nare staying in it and the husband was not. The husband’s counsel said\nthat sometimes the husband stays at one of his other properties,ie, a condominium unit but he also does\nstay at PP. The relationship between husband and wife is strained.\nThe latest update from the husband’s counsel is that once (or twice)\na week, the husband stays at night with his mother and sister. As\nthe wife has care and control of the daughter and the son is also\nlikely to stay with the wife too, I will grant the matrimonial house\nat PP to the wife and take that into account in the division. 11     In\nall the circumstances, I grant the wife 20% of $23,915,000 = $4,783,000\nas follows: S/NoItemsValue(a)HDB flat (free from encumbrances)$   550,000(b)Matrimonial home at PP (free from encumbrances)$2,600,000(c)Cash$1,001,332(d)Wife’s own assets (excluding her share in the HDB flat)$   631,668Total:$4,783,000   12     The\nHDB flat and PP are granted to the wife free from emcumbrances and\nthe values stated above are on that basis. Therefore, the husband\nis to pay any outstanding loan secured by the HDB flat or PP. He\nis entitled to retain the other assets held by him. As for the cash\nto be paid to the wife, the husband is to pay $500,000 within one\nmonth from the date of this judgment and the balance within six\nmonths from the date of this judgment. 13     The\nhusband is to vacate PP within six months from the date of this judgment\nor such other period as parties may agree to in writing. 14     Parties\nare to bear their own solicitor’s costs for the transfer of the husband’s\ninterest in the HDB flat and in PP to the wife. Any stamp duty for each\ntransfer is to be borne by the wife. Maintenance\nfor the wife 15     The\nwife sought lump sum maintenance calculated at $8,000 per month\nx 12 months x 17 years as orally clarified by her counsel. I see\nno reason to award her lump sum maintenance. 16     On\nthe question of periodic monthly maintenance, the wife claimed that\nher monthly expenses are $8,900 per month although she calculated her\nclaim for lump sum maintenance based on a multiplier of $8,000 and not\n$8,900 per month. She also said that she had reduced her expenses\nfrom about $13,000 claimed in her first affidavit of means. 17     The\nhusband submitted that the wife had claimed at one time that her expenses\namounted to $6,865.95 before she increased it to $8,900 per month.\nEven then, both claims included a monthly sum of $621 to pay the loan\nsecured by the HDB flat. As the husband was paying off that loan entirely,\nthe monthly payment would cease to apply. 18     I\nnoted that the wife was charging work related expenses of about $720\nper month which should pertain to her income earning capacity instead.\nFurthermore, her second list of expenses contained expenses which were\neither not necessary or inflated. For example, she included $800\nper month for personal development which was vague and should not\nbe allowed. She claimed $500 per month for personal grooming such\nas physio treatment, spas and facials. This appeared excessive. 19     Looking\nat the wife’s expenses in the round, I do not think that they exceed\n$6,500 per month. 20     The\nfact that the husband can afford to give her more is in my view irrelevant. 21     However,\nI note that the wife has not claimed the cost of purchasing a car.\nI presume this is because the husband has bought a BMW car recently for\nher. I am of the view that the husband’s obligation to provide the\nwife with a car is a continuing one and I leave it to the parties\nto try and agree as to how he is to do so. 22     The\nhusband submitted that the wife was receiving the following: (a)Her own income as a real estate agent$2,000 per month(b)Rent from the HDB flat$2,800 per month(c)Cash from the husband as maintenance pursuant to the wife’s\nrequest in 2010$2,000 per monthTotal:$6,800 per month   23     He\nsubmitted that the $6,800 was more than the wife’s original list\nof expenses after taking away the monthly payment for the HDB loan\nand he suggested that he continue paying her the $2,000 per month\nas maintenance for her. 24     Although\nit was unclear whether the HDB flat was still being rented out,\nit is still an asset from which the wife may derive an income. Although the\nrental market may have softened, that is the risk associated with\nsuch an asset as the rental market may also improve. I use $2,800\nper month as the income earning capacity of that flat. 25     The\nwife said she was earning an income of $2,000 per month as a real estate\nagent. While her income may be affected by a softening real estate market,\nthat is also the risk associated with the nature of her work and\nher income could also improve. Also, it is up to her to find alternative\nor additional income. I use $2,000 per month as her own income earning capacity. 26     In\nthe circumstances, I order the husband to pay the wife $2,000 per month\nas maintenance for her expenses with effect from 1 February 2015. This\nis the amount which he has been giving to her and he is to continue\nto do so. Maintenance\nfor the daughter 27     The\nwife’s allegation of expenses for the daughter was haphazard. In her\nfirst affidavit of means of 25 June 2013, she indicated at para\n15 that the expenses totalled $700 per month. In para 25, she claimed\n$3,000 per month for the daughter’s expenses. In the wife’s Updated\nAncillary Matters Fact and Position Sheet but said by her counsel\nto be filed on 11 April 2014 (undated), the wife stated that the\nchildren’s total monthly expenses was $1,050 per month. Then, in\nsubmissions before me, the wife was claiming $4,000 per month for\nthe daughter based on a list of alleged expenses. 28     The\nhusband’s first affidavit of means indicated at para 14 that his expenses\nfor the daughter were $1,200 per month. 29     The\nhusband submitted that the wife had asked for $3,000 per month for\nthe daughter’s expense and then increased her claim to $4,000 per month.\nHe offered $2,000 per month and he would also pay for the school fees\nof the daughter. He did not clarify whether this included some expenses like\ntuition for academic subjects and an alleged badminton coach fee\nand violin classes which were part of the wife’s submissions for\n$4,000 per month. 30     I\norder the husband to give the wife $2,000 per month as maintenance for\nthe daughter with effect with 1 February 2015. In addition, he is\nto pay for her: (a)     school\nfees; (b)     any\noverseas trips for exchange programs; (c)     tuition\nfor academic subjects; (d)     violin\nclasses; and (e)     badminton\ncoach fee, where appropriate. Costs 31     Each\nparty is to bear his/her own costs of the ancillaries."
