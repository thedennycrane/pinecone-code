        "The judge did not err in accepting the evidence of the prosecution witnesses": "23        After hearing the evidence of all the witnesses, the judge found that the prosecution witnesses were truthful and that their evidence was credible. By contrast, her observation of the defence witnesses led her to the following conclusion: I find that the defence witnesses had rehearsed their evidence such that their evidence-in-chief synchronized. But, upon further questioning, their answers diverged, revealing marked inconsistencies. They were also vague and lacked logic. It was obvious that they were playing down the role of the Accused in TGS. 24        An examination of the record of proceedings revealed no reason to disturb the judge’s conclusion. This ground of appeal was without merit. The judge erred in finding that Pritam had been showed the identity card 25        In her grounds of decision, the judge stated that Sundram had maintained throughout the trial that he had shown the identity card to Pritam, and that the latter had told him to keep it. She thus accepted that Sundram had shown the identity card to Pritam. To bolster her finding, the judge relied on the statements made by Pritam's counsel during mitigation. On appeal, Pritam argued that the judge had erred in making this finding of fact. 26        It is true that a lower court’s findings of fact should not be lightly disturbed:Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713. However, I found that the evidence in this case did not entitle the judge to conclude that Pritam had been shown the identity card. Throughout the proceedings below, Pritam had adamantly stated that he was not shown the identity card. More importantly, Sundram himself did not maintain that he had shown the identity card to Pritam. His only reference to having done so was in the following exchange during cross-examination: Q:         Refer to P3 – Q & A 18 – did Pritam Singh say those last words in Q18 answer – “there won’t be any problem”? A:         He did say those words. … Q:         This statement was made on 14 March 2002, when were these five words uttered to you by Pritam Singh? A:When I showed the identity card to him. I can’t remember the date. [emphasis added] 27        There was no other mention of Sundram having shown Pritam the identity card. A perusal of the evidence revealed that Sundram had consistently maintained that he had told Pritam about the identity card. Except for the passage reproduced above, he never claimed to have physically displayed the identity card to Pritam. 28        Under these circumstances, the judge was not entitled to find that Pritam had been shown the identity card. Moreover, she should not have relied on statements made during mitigation to confirm facts which were disputed during the trial. An appellate court is entitled to overturn a trial judge’s finding of fact if its assessment of the facts is not based on the demeanour of the witnesses, but on inferences drawn from the evidence as a whole:PP v Choo Thiam Hock & others[1994] 3 SLR 248. I allowed the appeal on this point, and found that Sundram had merely told Pritam that he was in possession of the identity card.",
        "The fact that Sundram had verbally informed Pritam of the identity card did not make the conviction unsound": "29        The law on abetting the employment of an illegal immigrant by intentional aiding was settled inLoh Kim Lan& another v PP[2001] 1 SLR 552. In that case, the court held that the requiredmens reawas a dominant intention to assist the employer in committing the offence of employing illegal workers, with knowledge of the circumstances constituting that offence. 30        In the present appeal, Pritam did not dispute that theactus reusof the offence was made out. Instead, he argued that the judge’s error made his conviction unsound as he did not have the requisitemens rea. He claimed that there was a “vast difference” between Sundram having shown him the identity card, and Sundram having told him that the card belonged to someone else. This was because the judge stated in her grounds of decision that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status because the photograph on the identity card bore no resemblance to Sundram himself. 31        I did not accept this argument. There were in fact several factors which the judge took into account when she found that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status. None of these factors were affected by her erroneous finding of fact. For example, the judge noted that, when Pritam handled Sundram’s salary vouchers, he must have realised that the vouchers showed no deductions for Central Provident Fund contributions or for the foreign workers’ levy. That meant that Sundram was neither a Singapore citizen nor a work permit holder. The judge also found that Pritam knew of TGSA’s application to the Licensing Division of the Police Force seeking approval for Sundram to be employed as a security guard in June 2001, and he knew that the application had been rejected. Furthermore, Sundram spoke with a fairly obvious accent, and had expressly told Pritam that he was in possession of another person’s identity card. 32        These were all patently suspicious circumstances which the judge relied on when she held that Pritam must have known of Sundram’s illegal status. These circumstances were independent of the allegation that Sundram had shown the identity card to Pritam. Therefore, even taking the judge’s erroneous finding of fact into account, I found no reason to disturb her conclusion that Pritam did have the requisitemens reafor the offence. 33        During oral submissions, Pritam’s counsel argued that the requisitemens reawas a dominant intention to assist the employer, and did not focus on the issue of knowledge. This argument was misconceived. The case law clearly shows that the requisitemens reais whether the accused had knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence. The question of ‘dominant intention’ only arises where there is a dispute over whom the accused had actually abetted. This was seen inDaw Aye Aye Mu v PP[1998] 2 SLR 64, where the High Court held that whether the accused had aided the employer or the illegal immigrant would depend on his dominant intention at the time that he did the act which led to the illegal immigrant’s employment. The judge did not err in calling for the defence 34        Pritam argued that the judge should not have called for his defence. His main contention was that Sundram was not a credible witness, and that his evidence could not be believed because it was often inconsistent. As Sundram was the main prosecution witness, the unreliable nature of his evidence meant that the prosecution had failed to discharge its burden at the close of its case. In support of this argument, Pritam outlined in great detail the discrepancies in Sundram’s evidence. 35        I agreed that Sundram gave inconsistent evidence on the following matters: a          The date on which he was given the identity card; b          The date on which he started work at Cairnhill Towers; c           The date on which he told Pritam that he was holding on to another person’s identity card; d           Whether he had any previous jobs before working at Cairnhill Towers; e          Why he went by the fictitious name of “Ashok Karan”; f            Whether he had signed all the payment vouchers which were made out to him; and g          Whether he had entered Singapore with a valid passport or visa. 36        However, I found no merit to the allegation that Sundram was an unreliable witness merely because his evidence was not perfect. His discrepancies related to minor details which were not crucial to this appeal. It was unequivocally stated inPP v Annamalai Pillai Jayanthi[1998] 2 SLR 165 that: Nevertheless,the mere presence of several discrepancies in the prosecution`s case cannot, per se, render its case manifestly unreliable. It is incumbent upon the trial judge to consider whether the inconsistencies are sufficiently fundamental to nullify that part of the evidence which supports the charge. [emphasis added] 37        I found no reason to disturb the judge’s decision to call for the defence. In her grounds of decision, she concluded that Sundram was a truthful witness after she had observed his demeanour in court. Due weight should be accorded to a trial judge’s assessment of a witness’ credibility based on demeanour in court:Jimina Jacee d/o C D Athananasius v PP[2000] 1 SLR 205. 38        Despite the inconsistencies in his evidence, Sundram had never wavered on three points: he had told Pritam that he was in possession of a Singapore identity card; he had informed Pritam that the card did not belong to him; and it was Pritam who paid him his salary. If unrebutted, these three points would establish each essential element of the offence. As I agreed with the judge that Sundram was a credible witness, I could not fault her decision to call on Pritam for his defence, as required by the principles outlined inHaw Tua Tau & another v PP[1980–81] SLR 73. Pritam remained liable for abetment even though Sukdev was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal 39        In his submissions, Pritam called it “remarkable” that he was charged for abetting Sukdev in employing Sundram, even though Sukdev was given a discharge not amounting to an acquittal. There was no merit to this assertion. There is no need for the principal to have been convicted prior to the abettor in order that the latter may be found liable for aiding him:Ong Ah Yeo Yenna v PP[1993] 2 SLR 73. After all, the verdicts against an abettor and his principal are not interdependent – the conviction of either party turns on the evidence against him, which may be different from that admitted against the other party: seeGovindarajulu and another v PP[1994] 2 SLR 838. The sentence was not manifestly excessive 40        There was no reason to disturb the sentence imposed by the judge. The benchmark sentence for cases which go to trial under s 57 of the Immigration Act has been set at 12 months:Soh Lip Hwa v PP[2001] 4 SLR 198. The sentence for abetting an offence is the same as if the abettor was charged for the offence itself: s 109 of the Penal Code. 41        Pritam had a previous conviction under s 57 of the Immigration Act, for which he was sentenced to eight months’ imprisonment. As a repeat offender, it could not be said that his sentence of 18 months (a mere six months above the benchmark) was manifestly excessive. Motion and appeal dismissed."
