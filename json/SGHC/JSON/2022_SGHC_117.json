        "Preliminary points": "3 It suffices for me to note in passing that a sealing order was sought and granted. I also accept the applicant’s arguments that the present application is governed by the Companies Act rather than the IRDA, as the date of the resolution of the creditors’ voluntary winding up was passed on 29 October 2019 before the commencement of the IRDA.",
        "Whether proceeds of a cause of action count as property under s 272": "4 It is not argued by the applicant that post-liquidation causes of action vesting in a liquidator are property of the company and hence assignable. The decision of the Court of Appeal inNeo Corp Pte Ltd (in liquidation) v Neocorp Innovations Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR(R) 717(“Neo Corp”) controls the issue. 5 The applicant argues, though, that the proceeds of causes of action arising in liquidation are property of the company which may be sold by the liquidator under s 272(2)(c) of the Companies Act. Just as no distinction is drawn between pre and post-bankruptcy assets, as was the case inRe Fan Kow Hin[2019] 3 SLR 861 (“Fan Know Hin”),neither should any be drawn in respect of the corporate insolvency context. The English decision inIn re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd[1998] Ch 170 (“Re Oasis”) which ruled that a liquidator could only sell pre-insolvency assets should not be followed. The Singapore Court of Appeal’s decision inNeo Corponly endorsedRe Oasisfor the narrow position in law concerning the assignment of causes of actions only, but does not bar the proceeds of post-liquidation causes of actions from being part of the property of the company which may be assigned by the liquidator. 6 However, as I did inFan KowHin(at [17]), I do not find that it is open to me to go behind the Court of Appeal’s endorsement ofRe OasisinNeoCorp. I have considered much the same arguments inFan Kow Hin. While the applicant has tried to narrow the scope of the endorsement ofRe OasisbyNeoCorp, it is not appropriate for me to so distinguish the Court of Appeal’s decision. I find that the scope of theNeoCorpadoption or endorsement is wider than that characterised by the applicant. There was no limitation as argued for. 7 It may be that it would be more rational to not distinguish between the position under the Bankruptcy Act (Cap 20, 2009 Rev Ed) (“Bankruptcy Act”), as determined byFan Kow Hin, and that under the Companies Act, but that is where we are: avoiding that differentiation is not reason enough for this court to go behindNeoCorp. It was not argued by the applicant that the position under the IRDA shows the clear parliamentary intention to do away with that distinction between the Bankruptcy Act and the Companies Act. But I would have rejected that argument in any event: the fact that Parliament enacted the provision in IRDA does not change the proper interpretation to be given to the Companies Act provision as indicated inNeoCorp. 8 In fact, the very enactment of s 144(1)(g) of the IRDA supports the proposition that it was not previously possible to assign the proceeds from post-liquidation causes of action under the Companies Act,following the principle that “Parliament shuns tautology and does not legislate in vain”(Tan Cheng Bock v Attorney-General[2017] 2 SLR 850 at [38]). This is made clear from the parliamentary debates discussing,inter alia, s 144(1)(g) of the IRDA (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report(1 October 2018) vol 94 (Edwin Tong Chun Fai, Senior Minister of State for Law)): … These new provisions allow the judicial manager to assign proceeds from such an action to a third party, in exchange for funding of the action. This new avenue of funding may increase the likelihood of such an action being pursued. This will, in turn, benefit stakeholders by providing higher recoveries, if such actions are successful. This new power is similarly provided to liquidators in clauses 144(1)(g) and 177(1)(a). To avoid doubt, these new provisions are only intended to provide for the assignment of proceeds from such an action brought by the judicial manager or liquidator. … The enactment of s 144(1)(g) of the IRDA was described as a “new power” provided to liquidators and would introduce a “new avenue of funding”.",
        "No maintenance or champerty": "9 The approach inRe Vanguard Energy Pte Ltd[2015] 4 SLR 597applies to the present case. I find on what is before me that the funding arrangement does not violate the rule against champerty or maintenance. Those standing behind the arrangement, namely creditors of the company, have an interest in the litigation. The proceedings will be under the control of the liquidator and allowing the arrangement to proceed will ensure access to justice since, otherwise, the company would not be able to investigate and pursue the claim. 10 This is sufficient for the applicant to be granted the substance of its application. The court thus grants the declaration sought by the applicant. Aedit AbdullahJudge of the High Court Andrew Chan Chee Yin (Allen & Gledhill LLP) (instructed), Clarence Lun Yaodong, Ang Minghao, Wong Changyan Ernest, Christopher Lim and Chua Qin En (Fervent Chambers LLC) for the applicant."
