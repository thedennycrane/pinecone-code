        "R v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson": "(1968) 52 Cr App R 113 (refd)Legislation referred toPenal Code (Cap 224) s 304(a)JudgmentGROUNDS OF DECISION1.        Lim Hock\n\nHin, a 42-year old male Singaporean pleaded guilty before me and was convicted for an\n\noffence of committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder under s 304 (a) of the\n\nPenal Code (Cap 224). The charge he faced averred that he slashed his 65-year old mother\n\nwith a knife at about 11.30 am, on 13 November 2001 with the intention of causing bodily\n\nhurt as was likely to cause death and caused her to suffer death on 20 November 2001.2.        The facts\n\nwhich gave rise to the present proceedings can be summarised as follows.3.        The accused\n\nand his mother Mdm Tan Ah Pong were residing at a flat at Block 12 Redhill Close, #01-106,\n\nSingapore. At about 11.30 am, on 13 November 2001, the accused had an argument with his\n\nmother in their flat over the whereabouts of a pearl bracelet given to him by someone. In\n\nthe course of the altercation, he started pushing his mother in the chest continuously.\n\nWhen his mother was trying to placate him by saying that she could not recall where she\n\nhad placed the bracelet, the accused started to become violent. He first used a chair and\n\nlater other objects which he could get hold of from the kitchen to hit and hurt her. When\n\nhis mother continued to protest that she could not recall where the bracelet was, the\n\naccused suddenly seized a knife found nearby and slashed her, causing her to fall.4.        It would\n\nappear that after Mdm Tan was hurt, she somehow managed to find her way to her\n\nneighbour’s flat and informed her neighbour that her son had stabbed her with a\n\nknife. The neighbour then called the police.5.        The\n\naccused, in the meantime, fled the flat in panic. However, as he reached the top floor of\n\na nearby block of flats, he felt that his mother might still be alive. He then decided to\n\nreturn home and he did.6.        Upon his\n\nreturn, the accused noticed the presence of police officers as well as his siblings\n\noutside the flat. Presently, he asked the police the condition of his mother and was told\n\nthat she was all right. He was soon arrested and sent to hospital for treatment as he was\n\nfound to have injured his right hand.7.        The\n\npost-mortem finding of Dr Wee Kheng Poh, Consultant Forensic Pathologist from the Centre\n\nfor Forensic Medicine, Health Sciences Authority, was that the cause of the death of the\n\nvictim was bronchopneumonia with hypoxic encephalopathy following a slash wound of the\n\nneck. The post-mortem report also listed a number of injuries to the victim’s head,\n\nneck, chest, abdomen and arms.8.        The accused\n\nwas, in the event, sent to Woodbridge Hospital for a psychiatric assessment. In the\n\nopinion of Dr Stephen Phang, Consultant Psychiatrist from Woodbridge Hospital and the\n\nInstitute of Mental Health, the accused was suffering from an acute epileptic seizure at\n\nthe time of the offence which significantly impaired his better judgment and impulse\n\ncontrol, to the extent that he attacked his mother fatally as a direct consequence of his\n\nmalady, which he would not have done had he not had a fit that morning. Dr Phang added\n\nthat ‘however impaired though his judgement may have been at and around the material\n\ntime, he still retained sufficient mental capacity to be capable of forming an intent to\n\ncause the injuries in question’.9.        Further,\n\naccording to Dr Phang, the accused retained the mental capacity to know that his act was\n\nlikely to cause death, although unfortunately, his mental responsibility was significantly\n\ndiminished at and around the material time, qualifying him for the defence of diminished\n\nresponsibility. Dr Phang noted that the accused had a history of epilepsy dating back to\n\n1983 and his seizures were still not optimally controlled in spite of treatment, with\n\nrecurrences on a regular basis. He commented further that when in the throes of an\n\nepileptic seizure, the accused would have a predilection towards behaving violently and\n\ndangerously. He concluded that the accused required treatment and close follow-up on a\n\npermanent basis.10.        The sole\n\nquestion before the court was what was the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case\n\nwhere the accused was found to be suffering from a mental condition which required\n\ntreatment on a permanent basis.11.        Section\n\n304(a) of the Penal Code provides that:Whoever\n\n    commits culpable homicide not amounting to murder shall be punished with imprisonment for\n\n    life, or imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be liable to\n\n    fine or to caning, if the act by which death is caused is done with the intention of\n\n    causing death, or of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death.12.        Defence\n\ncounsel in his mitigation plea urged the court not to impose a sentence of life\n\nimprisonment on the accused. In this regard, he invited my attention to the view expressed\n\nby defence psychiatrist, Dr Y C Lee who said that he ‘believed thatif the\n\nepilepsy of the accused is well controlled and his psychosis is kept in remission with\n\nmedications, he[ would be] able to live a normal life and would not be a danger to others.’\n\nIt was all well said but the question remained as to who was going to ensure the control\n\nand treatment regimen suggested by Dr Lee. The sad fact was that his mother who was\n\nresiding with him was gone forever because of his sudden violence.13.        The\n\nlearned DPP in his submission said that the belief expressed by the defence psychiatrist\n\nappeared to be predicated by a number of ‘ifs’ and ‘buts’ and urged\n\nthe court to take public interest into consideration. He reiterated Dr Phang’s\n\nprognosis that the accused required treatment and close follow-up on a permanent basis due\n\nto his continuing predilection towards violent and dangerous behaviour and the attendant\n\ndanger to the public and those who would be in immediate contact with him.14.        In\n\nrelation to the sentence to be imposed, my attention was invited to the sentences imposed\n\nby the High Court in the recent few years. Eight cases were cited and they were:Public\n\nProsecutor v Ong Wee Teck(2001) 3 SLR 479,Public Prosecutor v Kwok Teng\n\nSoon(2001) 4 SLR 576,Public Prosecutor v Wee Eng Jong(Criminal\n\nCase No 21/2001),Public Prosecutor v Dolah bin Omar(2001) 4 SLR 302,Public\n\nProsecutor v Aloysius Joshi Carilman(CC 43/1999),Public Prosecutor v Lim\n\nBoon Chong Cyril(Criminal Case No 34/1997),Public Prosecutor v Lee Chee\n\nSeng(Criminal Case No 48/1996) andPublic Prosecutor v Donald Peter\n\nChandraraj(Criminal Case No 9/1996).15.        The\n\nfollowing schedule sets out the brief facts and sentences imposed in the said eight cases:CaseMental ConditionBrief FactsPsychiatrist’s OpinionSentence imposedPP v Ong Wee Teck(2001) 3 SLR 479SchizophreniaThe accused killed his brother as he thought\n\n    that his brother was trying to poison himThe accused would require on-going treatment\n\n    probably on a lifelong basis.Life imprisonmentPP v Kwok Teng Soon(2001) 4 SLR 576Delusional DisorderThe accused killed his wife from China after\n\n    they had some disputes about money.In the event of a relapse, the accused could\n\n    be violent towards others.With treatment, the Delusional\n\n    Disorder could remit but control of symptoms is dependent on total compliance with\n\n    treatment and this would be difficult to enforce in the community.Life imprisonmentPP v Wee\n\n    Eng Jong(CC\n\n    21/01)SchizophreniaThe\n\n    accused stabbed a friend to death following a dispute at a coffee-shop.There is\n\n    a risk of the accused committing future acts of violence. The accused requires long term\n\n    psychiatric follow-up.Life\n\n    imprisonment.PP v Dolah\n\n    Bin Omar(2001)\n\n    4 SLR 302SchizophreniaThe\n\n    accused killed his uncle for no apparent reason. Psychiatrist opined that the accused was\n\n    suffering from paranoid delusion about the deceased.The\n\n    accused needs long term medication and can be a danger to others and himself if he does\n\n    not take his medication.Life\n\n    imprisonmentPP v\n\n    Aloysius Joshi Carilman (CC 43/99)SchizophreniaThe\n\n    accused used a bottle to hit his friend’s head and used a metal chair to hit his\n\n    chest and stamped on his chest.The\n\n    accused will pose a danger to himself and to society if he stopped medication.Life\n\n    imprisonmentPP v Lim Boon Chong\n\n    Cyril (CC 34/97)Schizo-affective\n\n    DisorderThe accused\n\n    smothered his 2 year old nephew with a pillow.The accused was a\n\n    danger to society.Life imprisonmentPP v Lee Chee Seng\n\n    (CC 48/96)Depressive\n\n    PsychosisThe accused, on\n\n    the instruction of hallucinatory voices, stabbed the deceased who had rejected his love.The accused had an\n\n    increased risk of being a danger to himself or others and this risk period was indefinite.Life imprisonmentPP v Donald Peter\n\n    Chandaraj (CC 9/96)Personality\n\n    DisorderThe accused\n\n    punched his 2 year old child to death for soiling his cot.The accused was a\n\n    threat to his family.Life imprisonment16.        \n\nIt would appear from the abovementioned cases that the courts have imposed sentences of\n\nlife imprisonment in similar situations where mentally impaired offenders were convicted\n\nfor committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder. To my mind, the concern\n\naddressed by the courts in the cases referred to were more in in the direction of\n\ntreatment, rehabilitation and prevention rather than deterrence or retribution. I was\n\ninclined to share the same view.17.        \n\nThe accused in the case before me was apparently oblivious to the fact that the person\n\nwhom he attacked – that too over a trivial pearl bracelet – was none other than\n\nhis mother, as he was then in the throes of an epileptic seizure. I was in agreement with\n\nthe expert opinion that the accused was indeed in need of a long and closely monitored\n\ntreatment regimen, and if not afforded that, the likelihood of danger and harm to the\n\npublic were not imaginary but real. In any event, in my view, the conditions for a long\n\nsentence set out inR v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson(1968) 52 Cr App R 113\n\n(per MacKenna J) and approved by the Court of Criminal Appeal inNeo Man Lee v\n\nPublic Prosecutor[1991] 2 MLJ 369at 370, by and large seemed to apply to the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case at hand. The conditions mentioned inHodgsonwere:A sentence of life imprisonment is justified when (1) the offence or offences are in\n\n    themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) it appears from the nature of\n\n    the offences or from the defendant’s history that he is unstable and likely to commit\n\n    such offences in the future; and (3) if the offences are committed the consequences to\n\n    others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of\n\n    violence.18.        \n\nConsequently, having considered all the factors, I sentenced the accused to a term of\n\nimprisonment for life with a direction that the accused be given treatment on a regular\n\nbasis for his illness whilst serving his sentence. In imposing the sentence, I was also\n\nmindful of the aspect that under Rule 119A of the Prisons Regulations, the accused might\n\nwell receive a remission of sentence if the Life Imprisonment Review Board were to\n\nconclude at the appropriate stage that he would be suitable for such remission.",
