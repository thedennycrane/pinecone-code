        "A. BACKGROUND": "2.    The plaintiffs, a company incorporated\n\nin the United States as an agricultural co-operative corporation, are\n\nmanufacturers and distributors of citrus fruit juices and drinks. Among their\n\nbrands of fruit juices are \"Floridas Natural\" and \"Floridas\n\nNatural Growers Pride\". The defendants, a company incorporated in\n\nSingapore, are in the cereals, sugar, oil, sauces, food beverage and dairy\n\nproducts business.3.    In\n\nthe beginning, the business relationship between the plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendants was mainly handled by Ms Leslie Powell, the manager of the plaintiffs\n\ninternational sales department, and Mr Melvin Neo, the defendants' general\n\nmanager. Although the plaintiffs did not sell their products in Singapore\n\nthrough any other company, the business dealings between the plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants were initially based on a rather loose arrangement. No written\n\nagreement was entered into by the parties and the plaintiffs contended that they\n\naccepted the defendants orders for their products on an ad hoc basis.\n\nHowever, the defendants took the view that they were the exclusive Singapore\n\ndistributors of the plaintiffs products from the time they placed their first\n\norders with the plaintiffs in 1997.4.    Whatever\n\nmay have been the nature of the plaintiffs relationship with the defendants\n\nin the past, their relationship with effect from 15 October 1998 was based on a\n\nletter of appointment (hereinafter referred to as the \"distributorship\n\nagreement\") of that date. Under the terms of this distributorship\n\nagreement, the plaintiffs appointed the defendants as the Singapore distributors\n\nof a specified range of their products for a period of one year.5.    In\n\ndue course, there was a measure of disagreement between Mr Neo and Mr Vernon\n\nKhoo, the defendants chairman and chief executive officer. As a result, Mr\n\nNeo resigned as the defendants general manager. On 31 August 1999, Mr Neo\n\ninformed Ms Powell that he had left the defendant company with immediate effect.\n\nMs Powell, who obviously had a lot of confidence in Mr Neos handling of the\n\nmarketing of the plaintiffs products, was rather concerned with this\n\ndevelopment, and especially so after learning that Mr Khoo had no immediate\n\nplans for hiring a replacement for Mr Neo. Instead, Mr Khoo planned to become\n\ndirectly involved with the management of the fruit and juice business.6.    The\n\nplaintiffs were perturbed that the resignation of Mr Neo came at a time when\n\ntheir American rival, Tropicana, was trying to enter the Singapore market. To\n\nthem, it was crucial for an experienced and competent person to oversee their\n\nbusiness when a heavyweight competitor was challenging them for the Singapore\n\nmarket. They were not comforted by Mr Neos assurance that the defendants\n\nteam was capable of handling the distributorship of their products. Their\n\nresponse was to appoint Mr Neo as their consultant for an initial period of 90\n\ndays. He was supposed to work closely with the defendants, who had no choice but\n\nto accept the situation. It was not surprising that the lack of cordiality\n\nbetween Mr Neo and Mr Khoo did not provide the right environment for a smooth\n\nworking relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendants.7.    Shortly\n\nthereafter, the defendants appointed a Mr Louis Neo to manage the marketing of\n\nthe plaintiffs products. He had little experience in the business and did not\n\nimpress the plaintiffs. As time passed, Mr Khoo became more involved with the\n\ndefendants business with the plaintiffs. By then, the plaintiffs and the\n\ndefendants had serious differences with respect to, among other things,\n\nmarketing strategy. On 17 September 1999, Mr Khoo proposed three alternatives to\n\nresolve the existing problems. The third alternative was worded as follows:Alternative 3If we cannot find an amicable solution, I do not wish to\n\n  continue as your distributor. We will cease any imports of Floridas Natural\n\n  with immediate effect.8.    The plaintiffs were rather concerned by\n\nMr Khoos \"threat\" to cease to act as their distributors. Ms Powell\n\nthought that Mr Khoos response to slight disagreements was \"very\n\nemotional\". In the meantime, the marketing budget for the period September\n\n1999 to August 2000 was not agreed upon.9.    Mr\n\nKhoo was astute enough to realise that the differences between the plaintiffs\n\nand the defendants had to be swiftly resolved because the distributorship\n\nagreement of 15 October 1998 was about to expire. On 4 October 1999, he went to\n\nOrlando for a meeting with Ms Powell to resolve their differences. According to\n\nMs Powell, the clear understanding was that unless and until a solution was\n\nfound to the problems she saw in the defendants handling of the marketing of\n\nthe plaintiffs products, the question of a renewal of the distributorship\n\nagreement, which was due to lapse on 14 October 1999, did not arise. However, Mr\n\nKhoo asserted that he left Florida with Ms Powells assurance that the\n\nplaintiffs did not intend to change distributors and that the distributorship\n\nagreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended.10.    After\n\nthe one-year period of distributorship envisaged by the distributorship\n\nagreement of 15 October 1998 expired, the defendants continued to order goods\n\nfrom the plaintiffs. The orders were accepted by the plaintiffs and the goods\n\nshipped to Singapore. The defendants appointed a Ms Rita Ng to manage the\n\ndefendants distributorship of the plaintiffs products. The plaintiffs were\n\nunhappy with the appointment as Ms Ngs previous experience was in the frozen\n\nchicken business. The plaintiffs contended that their reservations were not\n\nunfounded as subsequent events proved that Ms Ng was inexperienced in the retail\n\nfruit juice business.11.    In\n\nthe meantime, the defendants continued to press the plaintiffs for a renewal in\n\nwriting of the distributorship arrangement of 15 October 1998. However, the\n\nplaintiffs did not provide the defendants with such a written document.12.    The\n\nplaintiffs said that they were concerned that they would be left in the lurch if\n\nthe defendants ceased to act as their distributors. According to Ms Powell, one\n\nof the plaintiffs contingency plans was to own a shell company which could\n\ntake over the distributorship of their products. On 3 December 1999, the\n\nplaintiffs purchased a shell company, Formentar Pte Ltd. The plaintiffs\n\nconsultant, Mr Neo, was appointed a director of this company.13.    On\n\n13 December 1999, Ms Powell informed Mr Khoo that the plaintiffs were\n\nconsidering other options for the marketing of their products in Singapore. On\n\nthe same day, Mr Khoo cancelled an order for the defendants products for the\n\nnext six months and said that the plaintiffs decision to consider another\n\ndistributor to replace the defendants contravened the agreement that the\n\ndefendants would be the plaintiffs sole distributor in Singapore.14.    On\n\n17 December 1999, Ms Powell informed Mr Khoo that the plaintiffs had decided not\n\nto renew their distributorship agreement with the defendants. The plaintiffs\n\nnewly purchased shell company, which was renamed Fresh and Natural Food Pte Ltd,\n\nbecame the new distributors of the plaintiffs products.15.    On\n\n11 January 2000, the plaintiffs informed the defendants that the outstanding\n\namount due on their invoices for goods sold to the defendants amounted to\n\n$205,092.60. To date, the defendants have not paid this sum as they contended\n\nthat they had a right of set-off with respect to,inter alia,damages due\n\nto them for the plaintiffs wrongful termination of the distributorship\n\narrangement.",
        "B. WHETHER THE PLAINTIFFS WERE ENTITLED TO APPOINT A NEW DISTRIBUTOR": "16.    The main issue in this case is whether\n\nor not the plaintiffs were entitled to appoint a new distributor in December\n\n1999. This\n\n depends on whether or not the\n\n distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended and if so, for\n\n how long. In the absence of such an extension, the defendants would have no\n\n basis for refusing to pay the plaintiffs the sums due for goods purchased from\n\n them.17.    It\n\nought to be noted that in their pleadings, the defendants also contended that\n\nthe plaintiffs had extended the duration of the distributorship agreement by\n\nthree years with effect from March 1999, when the defendants took a three-year\n\nlease on a kiosk in Orchard Road for the purpose of selling the plaintiffs\n\nproducts. The defendants asserted that unless they had the assurance that the\n\ndistributorship arrangement had been renewed for three years, they would not\n\nhave committed themselves to a three-year lease on the kiosk. During the course\n\nof the trial, the defendants wisely abandoned this claim and decided to adopt\n\nthe stand that the plaintiffs had extended the distributorship agreement of 15\n\nOctober 1998 by one year after its expiry.18.    Clause\n\n4 of the letter of appointment of 14 October 1998, under which the plaintiffs\n\nappointed the defendants as their Singapore distributors states as follows:Unless sooner terminated as stated below, the term of this\n\n  commitment shall be for a period of one year commencing on the date of this\n\n  letter. However, it may be renewed thereafter by Citrus World on a year to\n\n  year basis.19.    The plaintiffs denied that they\n\nextended the distributorship agreement when it expired in October 1999. However,\n\nthe defendants contended that the plaintiffs had orally and by their conduct or\n\ncourse of dealings renewed the distributorship agreement by at least one year.\n\nIn support of their contention, the defendants alleged as follows:(a) the plaintiffs gave written confirmation to them that\n\n  they had no intention \"to make any changes\" in their\n\n  \"current\" arrangement in a letter dated 31 August 1999.(b) In the first week of October 1999, Ms Powell told Mr\n\n  Khoo in Orlando, Florida, that the duration of the distribution agreement had\n\n  been extended.(c) The plaintiffs continued to accept orders and supply\n\n  their products to the defendants after 15 October 1999.(d) Between October and December 1999, the defendants, with\n\n  the consent and approval of the plaintiffs, entered into and performed various\n\n  marketing and promotional activities for the purposes of promoting the\n\n  plaintiffs products.Each of the defendants assertions will be dealt with.The assurance in the plaintiffs letter of 31 August 199920.    The defendants first ground for\n\nclaiming that the distribution agreement had been renewed rests on the wording\n\nof a letter from Ms Powell to Mr Khoo on 31 August 1999, which was before the\n\nexpiry date of the distribution agreement. That letter, which was written on the\n\nday Mr Neo resigned from the defendant company, was in the following terms:You are aware that the current situation is that our\n\n  strongest competitor is entering the market. This situation provides for us to\n\n  be in both a defensive and counter-attack position in the market.In view of Melvin Neos resignation from Neo Trade, we\n\n  felt in [the plaintiffs] best interest to retain him as a consultant for\n\n  the Singapore market. Melvin was instrumental in the success of the brand, and\n\n  it is particularly important at this time that we have someone managing the\n\n  trade with proven experience.This action is not intended to imply that we have plans to\n\n  make any changes in our current arrangement with Neo Trade. The intention is\n\n  to insure that our business is managed by an experienced individual with\n\n  established business arrangements with the trade in Singapore. In addition,\n\n  this appointment is not intended to cause any interference within your\n\n  operation between Melvin Neo and your staff.(emphasis added)21.    The defendants had no basis whatsoever\n\nto read the above letter as an extension of the distribution agreement. The\n\nletter was primarily intended to inform the defendants that they were appointing\n\nMr Neo as their consultant on 31 August 1999 and the assurances to the\n\ndefendants, which were made before the expiry of the distribution agreement,\n\nshould be read in the proper context. In para 65 of her affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief, Ms Powell explained the position convincingly as follows:I also wish to say that at no time did I verbally assure\n\n  Khoo that we had no intentions of changing distributors. The only time such a\n\n  thing was mentioned was in the letter dated 31 August 1999 informing the\n\n  Defendants of Neos appointment as our consultant: This action is not\n\n  intended to imply that we have plans to make any changes in our current\n\n  arrangement with Neotrade. At the time the letter was written, the\n\n  distributorship agreement had not expired and the Plaintiffs had no plans to\n\n  make any changes in the arrangements then. What I did discuss with Khoo many\n\n  times was the lack of competent management personnel employed by the\n\n  Defendants.The alleged oral renewal in Orlando22.    The defendants next asserted that Mr\n\nKhoo was assured by Ms Powell during his trip to Orlando, Florida, in the first\n\nweek of October 1999 that the distributorship agreement had been extended.23.    Ms Powell denied having extended the\n\ndistributorship agreement when she met Mr Khoo in Orlando. In para 39 of her\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief, she said:On 4 October 1999, Vernon Khoo and I had a meeting in\n\n  Orlando, USA as arranged. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss an\n\n  amicable working arrangement suitable for both parties. The clear\n\n  understanding was that unless and until a solution was found there is no\n\n  question of renewing the Distributorship Agreement. Any new agreement will\n\n  have to be documented in a formal agreement to be signed by the parties. I\n\n  certainly did not confirm that the Distributorship Agreement was extended.\n\n  During the meeting, I reiterated the Plaintiffs dissatisfaction with Louis\n\n  Neos appointment as Melvin Neos replacement. I emphasized to Vernon Khoo\n\n  that the Defendants had to have experienced and professional people in place\n\n  to manage the business and to establish good relationships with the retailers.\n\n  Furthermore, the distribution strategy had to be maintained so that stock\n\n  levels and expiry dates were managed properly.24.    When cross-examined, Ms Powell stood\n\nher ground. She said as follows:At the meeting in Florida in October 1999, we discussed\n\n  what I required in order for the distributorship to continue. I gave no\n\n  assurances that the distributorship agreement would continue or that he would\n\n  remain as the distributor.25.    It is rather telling that when\n\nreferring to his meeting in Orlando with Ms Powell in his e-mail to her dated 11\n\nOctober 1999, Mr Khoo made no reference to the alleged extension of the\n\ndistribution agreement. Indeed, his letter confirmed in part what Ms Powell said\n\nwas discussed by her and Mr Khoo when they met in Orlando. The relevant portions\n\nof the letter are as follows:Further to our meeting in Orlando, this is to confirm the\n\n  following:- I will be addressing the issue of a sound management\n\n    replacement for Melvin in Neotrade.- I will be employing a marketing executive to handle\n\n    full time our marketing need for the company.- I will be forwarding to you a fresh advertising and\n\n    marketing plan for the next 12 months. I have a meeting with the Ad agency\n\n    this week to work on the plan.- Upon receipt of your samples, I will be negotiating\n\n    with Tricon to supply Floridas Natural to KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.Did I miss anything?? Its always possible when you get\n\n  pass 40.26.    In the above-mentioned letter, Mr Khoo\n\ncertainly missed something very important if the distributorship agreement had\n\nindeed been extended by Ms Powell during their discussions in Orlando. The\n\nabsence of this issue in Mr Khoos letter of 11 October 1999 reinforces Ms\n\nPowells evidence that she did not agree to extend the distributorship\n\nagreement when she met Mr Khoo in Orlando in early October 1999.27.    In\n\nparas 54 and 55 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Khoo also made no\n\nreference whatsoever to an extension of the distributorship agreement for a\n\nperiod of one year when he discussed his trip to Orlando in December 1999. He\n\nmerely said as follows:54. In order to address my concern and to express the\n\n  Defendants commitment to the Plaintiffs, I took a trip to the United States\n\n  of America. I went to see the representatives of the Plaintiffs in Orlando\n\n  Florida, USA sometime between 3rdand 7thOctober 1999.55. At the meetings I had with Leslie Powell, I was again\n\n  given assurances that the Defendants would continue to remain the distributors\n\n  for the products in Singapore.28.    When\n\ncross-examined, Mr Khoo testified that the word \"assurances\" in para\n\n55 of the affidavit of evidence-in-chief referred to the fact that the contract\n\nhad been extended by one year. His evidence is as follows:Q. See para 55 of your affidavit. Did Ms Leslie Powell say\n\n  that the agreement was extended?A. She did.Q. But you did not say that.A. By \"assurances\", she confirmed she would\n\n  renew.One would have thought that if the agreement had really been\n\nextended, nothing would have been easier than to state this clearly in the\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief.29.    It is worth noting that although Mr\n\nKhoo was quick to assert that he had been assured that the distribution\n\nagreement had been renewed, he did not know for how long it had been renewed.\n\nWhen cross-examined, his answers were as follows:Q. Extended for how long?A. She did not mention for how long. She said that the\n\n  letter of appointment would be renewed.30.    The letters which Mr Khoo wrote to Ms\n\nPowell on numerous occasions after 14 October 1999 also did not reveal that he\n\nhad secured an extension of the distributorship agreement. On 1 November 1999,\n\nMr Khoo wrote the following letter to Ms Powell:The existing distributorship appointment letter was dated\n\n  October 15, 1998 and was valid for one year, As we have both invested a vast\n\n  amount of resources to make Floridas Natural successful in Singapore, I\n\n  think it would be in the best interest of all parties if we formalise an\n\n  agreement which will provide confidence to both CWI and Neotrade to further\n\n  develop the Brand in Singapore.The agreement will stipulate clearly, our role and your\n\n  objectives for us in this market. I suggest an agreement for a period of 3\n\n  years renewable provided we commit to a realistic sales volumes, not less than\n\n  what we are doing now and with a reasonable projected growth for the next 3\n\n  years..31.    In the above letter, Mr Khoo accepted\n\nin no uncertain terms that the existing distributorship agreement was valid for\n\nonly one year. As such, it had expired. In his proposal for a new formal\n\nagreement, Mr Khoo wanted one which will stipulate clearly the defendants\n\nrole and the plaintiffs marketing objectives. Finally, he suggested a period\n\nof three years as the duration for the new distributorship arrangement. All\n\nthese show that nothing had been finalised and that the parties respective\n\npositions were still being discussed. What is glaring is that in his letter, Mr\n\nKhoo made no reference whatsoever to the alleged one-year extension of the\n\ndistributorship agreement. Neither did he say that the proposed three-year\n\ndistributorship relationship was to replace that established by the allegedly\n\nextended distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998.32.    Reference may also be made to Mr Khoos\n\nletter of 3 December 1999 to Ms Powell. In this letter, he wrote as follows:Could you kindly send us a renewal for the appointment\n\n  letter which expired in October. With all the rumours going around that Melvin\n\n  intends to take the agency away from Neotrade, I will be truly grateful if you\n\n  could formalise your verbal assurance that you have no intentions of changing\n\n  distributors as discussed many times.The original letter of appointment\n\n  has expired in October.(emphasis added)Again, the alleged extension of the distributorship agreement\n\nwas not mentioned. Instead, Ms Powell was reminded that the original letter of\n\nappointment had expired.33.    Finally, in his letter of 7 December\n\n1999 to Ms Powell, Mr Khoo again did not claim that the distributorship\n\nagreement had been extended by one year. In his letter, he merely stated:Im truly worried that you have not replied to my mails\n\n  regarding the expired letter of appointment and a clear position of our status\n\n  as your distributor. I know that you have verbally assured me many times that\n\n  you have no intention of appointing a new distributor.However, your representative Melvin has approached  and\n\n  some other parties, offering them to become the distributor of Florida Natural.34.    In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief\n\nand in all the letters referred to above, all that Mr Khoo asserted is that\n\nthere had been verbal assurances that the plaintiffs had no intention of\n\nchanging distributors. He also pointed out that Ms Powell did not deny in her\n\nreplies that she had assured him that the plaintiffs had no intentions of\n\nchanging distributors. Ms Powell pointed out that in her dealings with Mr Khoo,\n\nwhat was uppermost in her mind was to have the defendants get their act together\n\nas she had no confidence in the team which took over from Mr Neo. In any case,\n\nthere is a world of difference between being told by the plaintiffs that they\n\nhad no intention of changing distributors and being told by the plaintiffs that\n\nthe distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had been extended by one year.35.    After weighing the evidence, I do not\n\naccept that the defendants were given assurances that the distribution agreement\n\nwould be extended by one year.",
        "Fulfilling of orders and marketing of the plaintiffs\n\nproducts after 14 October 1999": "36.    The plaintiffs said that after the\n\nexpiry of the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998, they dealt with the\n\ndefendants on the basis of \"buy and sell\" and they reserved their\n\noptions as to what they would do with respect to the marketing of their products\n\nin the Singapore market. In para 41 of her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Ms\n\nPowell explained:[T]he Plaintiffs did not renew the Distributorship\n\n  Agreement when it ended on 15 October 1999. Although ideally the Plaintiffs\n\n  would like to continue with the same distributor if possible, the Plaintiffs\n\n  wanted time to assess the Defendants. In the meantime, the Defendants placed\n\n  orders and the Plaintiffs processed the orders per se the loose arrangement\n\n  prior to the Distributorship Agreement. There was no obligation on the part of\n\n  the Defendants to place orders, and either side could terminate the\n\n  arrangement at any point.37.    However, the defendants asserted that\n\nthe fact that the parties continued to import the plaintiffs products and to\n\nperform marketing and promotional activities on the plaintiffs behalf after\n\n14 October 1999 showed that the distributorship agreement had been renewed\n\nbeyond that date. They relied on the following statement of Blackburn J inSmith\n\nv Hughes(1871) LR 6 QB 597, 607:If, whatever a mans real intention may be, he so\n\n  conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was assenting to\n\n  the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief\n\n  enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be\n\n  equally bound as if he had intended to agree to the other partys terms.38.    The defendants also relied on the\n\nfollowing statement by Lord Diplock inPaul Wilson & Co A/SvPartenreederei\n\nHannah Blumenthal[1983] 1 AC 854, 915:[I]f A (the offeror) makes a communication to B (the\n\n  offeree) whether in writing, orally or by conduct, which, in the circumstances\n\n  at the time the communication was received, (1) B, if he were a reasonable\n\n  man, would understand as stating As intention to act or refrain from acting\n\n  in some specified manner if B will promise on his part to act or refrain from\n\n  acting in some manner also specified in the offer, and (2) B does in fact\n\n  understand As communication to mean this, and in his turn, makes to A a\n\n  communication conveying his willingness so to act or refrain from acting which\n\n  mutatis mutandis satisfies the same two conditions as respect A, the consensus\n\n  ad idem essential to the formation of a contract in English law is complete.39.    The situations referred to by Blackburn\n\nJ inSmithvHughesand by Diplock J inPaul Wilson & Co\n\nA/SvPartenreederei Hannah Blumenthalare completely different from\n\nthat in the present case, where both the plaintiffs and the defendants knew that\n\nthe distributorship agreement was no longer in force and the defendants were\n\ndesperately trying to get it renewed as they were not satisfied with their\n\nrather vague business arrangements with the plaintiffs following the expiry of\n\nthe distributorship agreement.40.    When cross-examined, Ms Powell pointed\n\nout that there could have not have been an extension of the distributorship\n\nagreement because both parties were still negotiating the terms of any future\n\ndistributorship arrangement. Her evidence is as follows:Q. During all this time, up to 7 December 1999, you never\n\n  indicated to the defendants that your dealings with them was on an ad hoc\n\n  basis of buy and sell?A. The e-mails prove that we were continuing to negotiate\n\n  the terms of the arrangement. Nothing had been agreed upon. I was giving\n\n  Vernon time to perform before we made up our mind.Q. Now, 15 October 1999 has come and gone. There was no\n\n  communication from you to Neotrade of the change?A. We were continuing to negotiate and had not agreed upon\n\n  an extension of the agreement, the duration of the extension and sales\n\n  volumes.I accept that Ms Powell described the situation after 14\n\nOctober 1999 correctly. It is inconceivable that she would have renewed the\n\ndistribution agreement when there were so many unresolved differences between\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendants.41.    The defendants then argued that if the\n\nposition after 14 October 1999 reverted to that which existed before the\n\ndistribution agreement was entered into on 15 October 1998, it ought to be noted\n\nthat they were the exclusive distributors of the plaintiffs products during\n\nthe period 1997 to 15 October 1998. This argument is flawed. Although the\n\ndefendants believed that they were exclusive distributors for the plaintiffs\n\nprior to the date of the distribution agreement, a closer look at the actual\n\nposition and at the terms of the distribution agreement will show that this was\n\nnot the case. The plaintiffs stated in the distribution agreement as follows:First, I must advise that it is Citrus Worlds general\n\n  policy not to name any of its distributors as being \"exclusive\".\n\n  However, in some areas, we have agreed, with certain conditions, not to\n\n  appoint any other distributors in the area for a limited period of time and we\n\n  are willing to make such a commitment to you upon the following terms: .4.  [T]he term of this commitment shall be for a\n\n    period of one year commencing on the date of this letter.(emphasis added)42.    It is evident from the terms of the\n\nabove letter that the plaintiffs agreed to appoint the defendants as their\n\ndistributors with effect from 15 October 1998 and that they did not accept that\n\nthe defendants were their exclusive distributors before that date.43.    I\n\nnow turn to the defendants contention that the fact that they carried out\n\nadvertising and promotional activities on behalf of the plaintiffs showed that\n\nthe distribution agreement must have been renewed. Before the distribution\n\nagreement was entered into on 15 October 1998, the defendants also carried out\n\nadvertising and promotional activities on the plaintiffs behalf and they were\n\ngiven a marketing budget. All these were on an ad hoc basis. It follows that the\n\nfact that the defendants carried out advertising and promotional activities\n\nafter 14 October 1999 does not prove that the plaintiffs had, by their conduct,\n\nagreed to extend the distributorship agreement by one year. Neither can the fact\n\nthat the defendants were asked to submit a marketing plan that spanned the\n\nremaining period of the distributorship agreement, as well as several months\n\nthereafter, be accepted as proof that the distributorship agreement had been\n\nextended. The plaintiffs were merely trying to see if the defendants were able\n\nto put forward an acceptable plan. As it turned out, they did not approve the\n\nmarketing plan and there was no approved marketing budget for the relevant\n\nperiod. When cross-examined, Ms Powell said:Q. You had in mind that this distributorship agreement\n\n  would go beyond October 1999?A. Could be but on a new set of terms.Q. The reason why you asked Vernon Khoo for a marketing\n\n  plan was to assure him that the agreement would go beyond October 1999?A. I cannot say that it was to give him that assurance.Q. What was the reason for not approving the marketing\n\n  plan?A. Because of the change in management in Neotrade since 31\n\n  August 1999. I thought it prudent to have a new plan because Melvin Neo had\n\n  left Neotrade.",
        "C. CONCLUSION": "44.    The defendants laid much emphasis on\n\nthe fact that they had built up the market for the plaintiffs products and\n\nthat they had expected a long-term relationship with the plaintiffs. If this was\n\nnot the case, they would not have invested so much money in promoting the\n\nplaintiffs products. They also pointed out that they had performed well in\n\nmarketing and distributing the plaintiffs products and there was no\n\njustification for the plaintiffs to be unhappy with their performance.45.    Whatever\n\nexpectations the defendants may have had in the past about their long-term\n\nrelationship with the plaintiffs, it is common ground that under the\n\ndistributorship agreement of 14 October 1998, the defendants were appointed as\n\ndistributors for only one year. As such, unless that agreement had been renewed,\n\nthe plaintiffs were entitled to appoint a new distributor in place of the\n\ndefendants. Whether or not the plaintiffs had been fair to the defendants and\n\nwhether or not the plaintiffs judgment on the ability of the defendants to\n\nperform their contractual obligations as distributor was flawed is not relevant\n\nto the plaintiffs right to appoint a new distributor for their products in\n\nDecember 1999.46.    It\n\nis startling that when trying to establish that the distribution agreement had\n\nbeen extended, the defendants were not altogether sure about the period for\n\nwhich the distributorship agreement had been allegedly extended. At first, they\n\ncontended that it had been extended by three years until 4 March 2002 (see para\n\n47 of Mr Khoos affidavit of evidence-in-chief). Admittedly, the defendants\n\nfinally abandoned their claim that the contract had been renewed until 4 March\n\n2002 but this does not change the fact that if the distributorship arrangement\n\nhad already been extended in March 1999 until March 2002 as alleged by Mr Khoo,\n\nthere was no reason for him to settle for a one-year extension until 14 March\n\n2002 when he met Ms Powell in Florida in October 1999. He should have insisted\n\non his rights that the distributorship arrangement had at that time, almost 2\n\nyears to run. Again, although the defendants finally settled for an extension of\n\none year, it is pertinent to note that in paragraph 9 of their Amended Defence\n\nand Counterclaim, they made the allegation that the distributorship agreement\n\nhad been extended for at least one year with effect from 15 October 1999, thus\n\nsuggesting that it may have been extended for a longer period of time. Finally,\n\nin para 36 of his affidavit, Mr Khoo gave the impression that the plaintiffs had\n\nagreed that the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 was to be extended\n\nautomatically so long as the defendants met the sales target and the terminating\n\nevents specified in the agreement did not occur. This view of the plaintiffs\n\nobligations is of course not supported by the express terms of the written\n\ncontract and it was not seriously canvassed by the defendants. The various\n\npositions adopted by the defendants with respect to the renewal of the\n\ndistributorship agreement certainly did not help their case, and especially so\n\nwhen it is for them to prove that the distributorship agreement had been\n\nextended by the plaintiffs.47.    After\n\nreviewing the evidence and after having had the opportunity to assess the\n\nwitnesses, I accept that the distributorship agreement of 15 October 1998 had\n\nnot been orally extended by Ms Powell and that the course of dealings between\n\nthe plaintiffs and the defendants did not evidence any extension of the said\n\ndistributorship agreement. The plaintiffs were thus entitled to appoint a new\n\ndistributor on 17 December 1999, and by doing so, were not in breach of\n\ncontract.48.    The\n\nplaintiffs claim for $205,092.60 for products supplied to the defendants is\n\nupheld. They are entitled to interest at the rate of 6% as from the date of the\n\nwrit. For the record, it ought to be noted that it is unnecessary for the\n\nplaintiffs other claims or the defendants counterclaim to be considered\n\nbecause the parties agreed during the course of the trial on the terms for\n\nsettling their respective remaining claims in the event that the plaintiffs\n\nclaim that they were entitled to appoint a new Singapore distributor for their\n\nproducts in December 1999 is upheld.49.    The plaintiffs are entitled to costs.",
