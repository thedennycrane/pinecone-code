        "Profit sharing scheme": "46. The Company’s case is that the\n\nagreement in relation to this scheme is void for uncertainty. I have heard no submission\n\non this but I have read the description of this scheme in the second memorandum and I am\n\nunable to see in what way any of its provisions can be said to be void for uncertainty. In\n\nmy judgment the agreement in relation to the profit sharing scheme as contained in or\n\nevidenced by the second memorandum is not void for uncertainty.Waiver47. Paragraph 7 of the defence states:\"The defendants deny there was any\n\n  breach of any agreement as alleged in paragraph 6 of the amended statement of claim or at\n\n  all. The defendants aver and repeat paragraph 3.1 of the amended defence and say that even\n\n  if they had breached the agreement, which is denied, the plaintiff is estopped from\n\n  relying on the alleged breach by reason of his waiver thereof in continuing in his\n\n  employment with the defendants without demanding performance of the alleged\n\n  agreement.\"Paragraph 3.1 refers to the sales volume\n\nincentive scheme and denies that any agreement was made on or about 11 July 1996 and\n\nalleges that on or about 7 August 1996 Ms Tan only \"discussed offering [Mr Tay] the\n\nscheme which was to apply from August 1996 up to December 1996\" and that he had been\n\n\"duly paid his entitlement\". Apart from what is alleged in para 7 no particulars\n\nof the waiver are given.48. Mr Low referred toChitty on\n\nContracts(28th Ed, 1999) para 23-039 which has this statement:\"Waiver (in the sense of ‘waiver\n\n  by estoppel’ rather than ‘waiver by election’) may also be held to have\n\n  occurred if, without any request, one party represents to the other that he will forbear\n\n  to enforce or rely on a term of the contract to be performed or observed by the other\n\n  party, and the other party acts in reliance on that representation.\"and para 23-043 which has this statement:\"Although consideration need not be\n\n  proved, certain other requirements must be satisfied for such an estoppel to be effective:\n\n  first, it must be clear and unequivocal; secondly, the other party must have altered his\n\n  position in reliance on it, or at least acted on it.\"He then referred to Treitel,The Law of\n\nContract(10th Ed, 1999) at p 102 which has this statement:\"… failure to object to a known\n\n  defect or deficiency within a reasonable time of its discovery may be regarded as an\n\n  unequivocal indication of the injured party’s intention not to insist on his strict\n\n  legal rights.\"49. The Company’s case is that in\n\nMarch 1997 Mr Tay knew that he had not been paid his benefits under the profit sharing\n\nscheme and when he went to see Ms Tan with the intention of bringing this up he was told\n\nthat the sales volume incentive scheme only operated up to December 1996. He continued in\n\nemployment without making any claim until after his employment was terminated in February\n\n1999. Mr Low referred toUMW Toyota (M) Sdn Bhd vChow Weng Thiem[1996] 5 MLJ 678.50. In theUMW Toyotacase Chow was\n\nemployed as manager of one of the company’s branches. There were, as the learned\n\njudge said, two contracts of employment. Under the 1977 contract three months’ notice\n\nwas required to terminate his employment but under the 1984 contract the period of notice\n\nwas one month. The 1984 contract also conferred on Chow additional benefits and an\n\nincrease in salary. He was dismissed by the company and he claimed damages for wrongful\n\ndismissal to be assessed on the basis of the salary and benefits under the second contract\n\nand the requirement of three months’ notice under the first contract. Abdul Malik\n\nIshak J said at p 685:\"Having enjoyed the fruits of the\n\n  second contract for [4 years 10 months 25 days], the respondent had lost the right to\n\n  repudiate the same. In my judgment, the prolonged delay amounted to an implied affirmation\n\n  by the respondent of the second contract.\"I am unable to see that this case is of\n\nany assistance.51. Mr De Souza referred toGold Coin\n\nLtd v Tay Kim Wee[1986] SLR 68where Lai Kew Chai J (delivering the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeal) said at p 74:\"… counsel for the employers\n\n  submitted that if an officious bystander were to have asked the parties whether the\n\n  contract to pay a quantum meruit was still binding, the parties would have answered in the\n\n  negative. We do not think so at all. Mr Tay who had not given the matter a moment’s\n\n  thought would probably have said yes. Certainly, the employers would have answered yes. Mr\n\n  Arnet, the Managing Director of the employers, in fact had honestly affirmed that he would\n\n  have ‘done something about it’, that is, he would have paid Mr Tay his due, if\n\n  he had known about it. It has to be stressed again that Mr Tay was not only totally\n\n  devoted to his work; he did not much care about his entitlements. On the question of\n\n  bonuses, he had always left it to Mr Arnet, as the latter frankly admitted in evidence. In\n\n  these circumstances, it seems to us that the selfless inactivity of one party and the\n\n  ignorance of the other party are very poor foundation to support any implied consensual\n\n  variation of the contractual term to pay a quantum meruit.\"The \"inactivity\" was over a\n\nperiod of about 15 years. The defence was variation of the contract and not as in the case\n\nbefore me the equitable defence of waiver by estoppel but there is probably \"no\n\nessential juridical difference between waiver and variation\". SeeBanning v Wright\n\n(Inspector of Taxes)[1972] 1 WLR 972 at p 991 per Lord Simon of Glaisdale.52. InW J Alan Co Ltd v El Nasr Export\n\nand Import Co[1972] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 313 Lord Denning MR said at p 323:\"The principle of waiver is simply\n\n  this: If one party, by his conduct, leads another to believe that the strict rights\n\n  arising under the contract will not be insisted upon, intending that the other should act\n\n  on that belief, and he does act on it, then the first party will not afterwards be allowed\n\n  to insist on the strict legal rights when it would be inequitable for him to do so\n\n  ….\"SeeHughes v Metropolitan Railway\n\nCompany(1877) 2 App Cas 439 at p 448 for the classic statement of Lord Cairns LC on\n\nthe general principle and see alsoBirmingham and District Land Company v London and\n\nNorth Western RailwayCompany(1888) 40 Ch D 268 at p 286;Central London\n\nProperty Trust Ltd vHigh Trees House Ltd[1947] KB 130;Enrico Furst Co v W\n\nE Fischer Ltd[1960] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 340.53. In para 4 of its defence the Company\n\nsays that a trade-in profit sharing scheme covering the period August 1996 to December\n\n1998 and a prestige division profit sharing scheme covering the period September 1996 to\n\nJune 1997 applied for the equal benefit of Mr Tay and a Mr Chng and that \"these were\n\nthe two incentive schemes applicable to both [Mr Tay] and [Mr Chng] in the UCD save that\n\nby a prior agreement referred to at paragraph 3.1.2 above [Mr Tay] was given an additional\n\nincentive scheme which was to apply to him until the end of 1996\". Mr Chng was\n\ntransferred to the UCD in late August 1996 and appointed to his position there on 11\n\nSeptember 1996. The two schemes were based also on savings in the over-trade.54. Mr Tay admits in his reply that he and\n\nMr Chng participated in the two schemes but he says that they were in addition to the two\n\nschemes under which he claims. It is not disputed that there was no inconsistency between\n\neither of the two schemes which applied to both Mr Tay and Mr Chng and either of the two\n\nschemes which applied to Mr Tay alone and participation in one was not inconsistent with\n\nparticipation in any of the others.55. Ms Tan said in her first affidavit:\"After [Mr Chng] was transferred to\n\n  the UCD, I continued to conduct regular meetings with [Mr Chng] and [Mr Tay] on the\n\n  mechanics of the UCD operations and the scheme of incentives to be paid to the UCD\n\n  department. It was at one of these meetings that Idecided on(italics added) the\n\n  UCD trade-in incentive scheme after discussion with [Mr Tay] and [Mr Chng].\"Under cross-examination she corrected her\n\nstatement in the affidavit and replaced \"decided on\" with \"confirmed\".\n\nShe also said that the meeting when she confirmed the scheme took place at the end of\n\nAugust 1996. Her evidence was:\"Q: Told them earlier?A: Yes.Q: When?A: Not together. Told Alan Tay around week beginning 12/8/96. Told Ricky Chng would say\n\n  around mid-August as well. Alan Tay first.Q: If already told Alan Tay in week\n\n  commencing 12/8/96 why necessary to confirm at end August 1996?A: Because I wanted to make sure they knew how their profit sharing was to be calculated.Q: What you told Alan Tay on 12/8/96\n\n  different from what you told Alan Tay and Ricky Chng at end August 1996?A: No.\"The last answer is not likely to be true\n\nif as she had testified in the week commencing 12 August 1996 she had confirmed with Mr\n\nTay the sales volume incentive scheme which was applicable to him only.56. There were four separate schemes of\n\nincentives Mr Tay was entitled to. There were the two schemes under which he claims and\n\nthere were also the two schemes admitted on the pleadings and which applied to him and to\n\nMr Chng. Under the profit sharing scheme payment was to be made at the end of the year.\n\nUnder the sales volume incentive scheme time for payment was not stated in the second\n\nmemorandum but by its terms the amount to be paid could only be ascertained at some time\n\nafter the end of the relevant month. Time for payment under the trade-in profit sharing\n\nscheme and prestige division profit sharing scheme was not expressly stipulated. Mr Tay\n\nhas been paid under the last two schemes. The question is whether he has waived his strict\n\nrights under the profit sharing scheme for which he has not been paid at all and under the\n\nsales volume incentive scheme under which he has only been paid for the period down to\n\nDecember 1996.Conduct57. It is said that for estoppel to be\n\neffective for the defence of waiver by estoppel it must be clear and unequivocal. See the\n\npassage inChitty onContractscited. InBremer Handelsgesellschaft mbH v\n\nVanden Avenne-Izegem PVBA[1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109 Lord Salmon said at p 126:\"To make an unequivocal\n\n  representation or waiver it is not necessary for the buyers to say, ‘We hereby waive\n\n  it’. It is quite enough if they behave or write in such a way that reasonable sellers\n\n  would be led to believe that the buyers were waiving any defect there might be in the\n\n  notice and were accepting it as effectively extending the date for delivery in accordance\n\n  with the provisions of cl 22.\"That was a sale of goods case but I think\n\nthe principle applies equally to a case between an employer and employee. What was Mr\n\nTay’s conduct and in the circumstances would a reasonable employer be led to believe\n\nthat the employee was waiving the employer’s breach of contract in not paying him\n\nunder the two benefit schemes?58. Ms Tan produced all the relevant\n\nvouchers and a summary of the payments made to Mr Tay. Benefits under the sales volume\n\nincentive scheme were paid to Mr Tay with his salary in respect of August and September\n\n1996. For each of the three months from October to December 1996 he was paid about three\n\nweeks into the following month. The vouchers describe these benefits as\n\n\"Commission\" or \"S/Comm\" which presumably is short for \"Sales\n\nCommission\". The first payment under the trade-in profit sharing scheme appears\n\naccording to the summary to have been made on 29 November 1996 but the voucher describes\n\nthe benefit as \"Sales Commission\". The next payment was on 15 April 1997 for\n\npart of the benefit for the period to November 1996 and 16 July 1997 for the balance for\n\nthe period to December 1996. The vouchers describe the earlier payment as \"Oct &\n\nNov Partial\" and the later payment as \"Balance of Oct–Dec 96 Profit\n\nSharing\". Subsequent vouchers describe the benefits variously as \"Sales\n\nCommission\", \"Comm\" and \"Profit Sharing\". The benefits under the\n\nprestige division profit sharing scheme were paid with the February 1997 salary in respect\n\nof the period to December 1996 and on 8 August 1997 for the period to June 1997.59. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit:\"In March 1997 or so, I happened to\n\n  meet Ms Tan at the 2nd floor of Ubi Centre and I enquired about the Sales Volume Incentive\n\n  Scheme and the other remuneration that had been agreed when I had accepted the position of\n\n  executive in charge of the UCD. She said that the Sales Volume Incentive Scheme was\n\n  implemented only for 1996. She made no mention of the other benefits. I was shocked at her\n\n  reply and kept quiet.\"Under cross-examination he said:\"Q: Financial controller. You checked\n\n  with him at any time your AT OT allowance?A: I have.Q: When?A: February or March 1997.Q: What he told you?A: Asked me to find out from Ms Tan.Q: You did so?A: Yes.Q: What she told you?A: (To court): I did not ask her about my AT OT allowance.(Witness warned).Q: Why not? About your AT OT allowance?A: When I went to see her she told me unit incentive scheme had been terminated on\n\n  31/12/96. By ‘unit incentive scheme’ I mean scheme under which I was to get $40\n\n  per unit above 140 units. When I heard that I was very surprised. So I dared not ask her\n\n  about my AT OT allowance.Q: When this conversation took place?A: March 1997.Q: Question of your AT OT allowance. Never\n\n  brought up with defendant? Other than reference to financial controller?A: Agree.\"\"AT OT allowance\" refers to the\n\nbenefits under the profit sharing scheme described in the second memorandum.60. Mr Tay did not bring up the matter of\n\nhis entitlement under the profit sharing scheme with the Company after the occasion in\n\nFebruary or March 1997 when he spoke to the financial controller. He did not bring up the\n\nmatter of his entitlement under the sales volume incentive scheme which Ms Tan told him he\n\nwould not enjoy after December 1996. He continued to work for the Company. He received his\n\nbenefits under the trade-in profit sharing scheme and the prestige division profit sharing\n\nscheme. He carried on in the employment of the Company in this way until February 1999\n\nwhen his employment was terminated.61. Mr Tay was employed by the Company in\n\n1979 and until August 1996 he was only a sales representative earning a monthly salary of\n\n$200. Of course as pointed out above he also received a commission on sales and he\n\nreceived a substantial sum from the outside sources but all the income was tied to his\n\nemployment. Ms Tan described him as a mediocre sales representative. She interviewed him\n\nand she must have thought that he could nevertheless perform as senior executive for\n\n$3,000 a month and later as assistant manager for $3,300 a month with the benefits under\n\nthe schemes which applied to him but his employment could be terminated on one\n\nmonth’s notice or on payment of only a month’s salary as in fact it was. Mr\n\nTay’s English was not good and as he said in his second affidavit he needed someone\n\nlike Mr Chng to assist him in his new position. He had a number of years of experience in\n\nthe business of selling cars but there is no evidence that he had any qualifications or\n\nskills which could serve him outside of the car sales business. His employment was\n\ninsecure and if he lost it he was ill equipped for any other employment.62. In January 1997 Mr Tay received his\n\nbenefit under the sales volume incentive scheme for December 1996. He did not receive\n\nanything under any of the other schemes. In February 1997 he received his benefit under\n\nthe prestige division profit sharing scheme. He received it with his salary for the month\n\nand it would have been at the end of the month as the voucher states. He did not receive\n\nanything under the other schemes. He went to see the financial controller and he was told\n\nto see Ms Tan. The financial controller would have known whether the accounts were ready\n\nfor the Company to ascertain the amount to pay him. He said this was in February or March\n\n1997 but I think it would have been after he received his February 1997 salary.63. Mr Tay said in his second affidavit\n\nthat when he happened to see Ms Tan at Ubi Centre (where the Company carried on business)\n\nhe \"enquired about the sales volume incentive scheme and the other remuneration that\n\nhad been agreed when [he] had accepted the position of executive in charge of the\n\nUCD\" and was told that the sales volume incentive scheme was \"implemented only\n\nfor 1996\". Under cross-examination he said he \"dared not ask her about [his] AT\n\nOT allowance\". He was not asked why he dared not. I accept his evidence and I think\n\nhe would have been very troubled by what he heard about the sales volume incentive scheme.\n\nHe had only just been promoted to assistant manager. I think he as he said \"dared not\n\nask her about [his] AT OT allowance\".64. On 15 April 1997 Mr Tay received\n\n$15,000. This is the payment which the voucher describes as \"Oct & Nov\n\nPartial\". There is a signature on the voucher for acknowledgment of receipt although\n\nthere is no direct evidence as to its being his. There is no evidence that he was told\n\nwhat it was for or what he thought it was for at the time it was received by him. It is\n\nnot disputed now that it was for the benefit under the trade-in profit sharing scheme\n\napplicable to him and Mr Chng. In the course of the subsequent months down to February\n\n1999 he received his monthly salary and from time to time other sums under the two schemes\n\napplicable to him and Mr Chng but again there is no evidence that he knew what each of\n\nthese other sums was for.Belief65. Mr Tay continued in his employment\n\nuntil it was terminated. He turned up for work. He carried on as assistant manager in the\n\nUCD to which position he had been promoted from January 1997. There is no evidence of any\n\nchange in his position. There is no evidence of any change in his duties. There is no\n\nevidence that he was given less work to do or that he did less work than in the first few\n\nmonths of 1997 or at any time. He not only continued in his employment but he continued to\n\ncarry out his duties under the terms of his employment. What he did by continuing in his\n\nemployment was what he was contractually bound to do under the terms of his employment. It\n\nwas not different and it was not less. I do not think that a reasonable employer would at\n\nany time at all be led by Mr Tay’s continuing in his employment in these\n\ncircumstances to believe that he was waiving any breach by the Company in respect of its\n\nfailure to pay under the two benefit schemes.66. This disposes of the case as pleaded\n\nbut I have heard evidence as to one other matter which has to be considered. Mr Tay took\n\nno action to insist on his rights apart from the instances when he raised the matter with\n\nthe financial controller and with Ms Tan but was there anything that he could do without\n\nputting his employment and with it his future at risk? If he made a claim he could lose\n\nhis job and he would still have to prosecute his claim - the more so if he in fact lost\n\nhis job. In the event he lost his job and soon after he asked for his benefits. The\n\nbenefits under the profit sharing scheme were payable at the end of the year. For 1996 he\n\nshould have been paid in the first few months of 1997. For 1997 and 1998 he should have\n\nbeen paid in 1998 and 1999. There was accordingly no delay in respect of 1998 and a delay\n\nof two years and one year in respect of 1996 and 1997. A reasonable employer would not at\n\nany time at all be led to believe that Mr Tay was waiving any breach by the Company of its\n\nobligations to pay under the two benefit schemes. There was no reason to insist on his\n\nrights in the circumstances. There was every reason to hold back on any action that he\n\nmight have taken.67. I have taken all the circumstances\n\ninto consideration. I have considered them separately and I have considered them together\n\nand I have considered them at intervals of time as Mr Tay continued in his employment. In\n\nmy judgment Mr Tay has not waived any breach by the Company. Although this is sufficient\n\nto dispose of the defence of waiver or waiver by estoppel as pleaded I will go on to\n\nconsider briefly the other requirements for such a defence to succeed.Act on belief68. It has to be shown that Mr Tay\n\nintended that the Company should act on the belief that the strict rights arising under\n\nthe benefit schemes would not be insisted upon. His intention can only be gathered from\n\nhis conduct in the circumstances. He delayed taking any action. There was an explanation\n\nfor this. He continued in his employment. He was merely doing what he was contractually\n\nbound to do. It has also to be shown that the Company did act on the belief. No\n\nparticulars have been pleaded but on the evidence all that the Company did was to continue\n\nto employ Mr Tay and to continue in the breach ie to continue not to pay him under the two\n\nbenefit schemes. The breach had occurred before the conduct which is relied upon as having\n\nled to the belief. It was not a case of waiver of a right to be paid before any breach of\n\nthe obligation to pay in which case subsequent non-payment would be strong evidence of\n\nacting on the belief. In my judgment it has not been shown that Mr Tay had the necessary\n\nintention or that the Company acted on the belief.Inequitable69. The Company has not paid. It has not\n\naltered its position in any way even if it had acted on any belief that the strict rights\n\nwould not be insisted upon. There is no evidence that acting on the belief it has\n\nconducted its affairs in any particular way or that having regard to the way it has acted\n\nit would be inequitable for Mr Tay to insist upon his rights. It is true that both benefit\n\nschemes are \"subject to change based on changing market conditions\" but the\n\nCompany’s case as pleaded is that it made no agreement to pay under either of the two\n\nbenefit schemes and no evidence was adduced as to such changes as the Company might have\n\nmade. I see no reason for coming to any conclusion that it would be inequitable for Mr Tay\n\nto insist upon his strict rights to be paid under the two benefit schemes.70. At the close of submissions I\n\nintimated that there would be judgment for Mr Tay and invited counsel to address me as to\n\nthe reliefs claimed. Counsel were unable to offer any assistance on the basis of their\n\ninstructions and in the event I gave judgment for accounts to be taken as prayed for.Lim Teong QweeJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
