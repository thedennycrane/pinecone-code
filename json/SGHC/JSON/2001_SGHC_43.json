        "The appeal": "I will first deal with the question whether the `non-contribution` clause in the Citystate policy was a clause that was prohibited under the Regulations.",
        "Regulation 2(1)": "Sub-clause (a)Sub-clause (b)Mr Ramasamy, counsel for Citystate, invited the court to undertake a close study of the conditions and exceptions enumerated in sub-cll (a) to (d) of reg 2(1). He submitted that such a study would show that these sub-clauses cover situations that arise under both limbs of reg 2(1). To take just the first two sub-clauses:applies to a situation `after` the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. This would be a second limb situation, ie liability has arisen but a condition in the policy seeks to enable the insurer to repudiate liability.applies to a situation `before` the occurrence of the event giving rise to the claim. This would be a first limb situation, ie the insurer is seeking to stop liability under the policy from arising.He submitted that as the sub-clauses covered conditions and exceptions affecting both limbs, it must follow that the sub-clauses qualify not just the second limb, but also the first limb. I accept that submission of Mr Ramasamy. An examination of the sub-clauses clearly indicates that they cover both limbs of reg 2(1). As a matter of construction it appears to me that both limbs of reg 2(1) are governed by sub-cll (a) to (d).In view of the above, the question that has to be asked is whether the `non-contribution` clause was a condition or exception that fell under any of the situations envisaged in sub-cll (a) to (d). Only if it did, would the `non-contribution` clause be prohibited. Mr Ramasamy submitted - and I agree with that submission - that the `non-contribution` clause did not fall within the scope of any of the sub-clauses. That being so, the `non-contribution` clause in this case was not a condition or exception prohibited by reg 2(1). It was a valid clause. In the circumstances, as De Kong`s liability in respect of the 15 injured workmen was covered by the AXA policy, Citystate by reason of the `non-contribution` clause, would not be liable for any part of the compensation payable unless - and it was not so in this case - the compensation exceeded the limit of liability under the AXA policy. In the circumstances, the liability to pay the compensation in this case fell on AXA.",
        "Section 23(1): Can a sub-contractorrely on the main contractor`s policy?": "The above finding is sufficient to dispose of this appeal. Mr Ramasamy, however, pointed out that the decision of the Commissioner - that the existence of the AXA policy covering the liabilities of De Kong under the Act was not a sufficient compliance by De Kong of its obligations under s 23(1) - had far-reaching consequences. He pointed out that it was common industry practice for main contractors to provide insurance cover for their sub-contractors and for sub-contractors either not to take out any policies themselves or to take out policies that only cover any award over and above the limit of the cover in the policy taken out by the main contractor. Indeed, AXA in this case had not sought to deny that its policy covered claims against De Kong and it was in evidence that AXA, in respect of the injured employees of De Kong, had initially paid out some such claims. Mr Ramasamy submitted that if the Commissioner`s decision on this aspect was not set aside, there would be confusion in the insurance and construction sectors. There was also the question whether a sub-contractor who - satisfied with his cover under the main contractor`s policy - did not himself directly take out a policy, was in breach of s 23(1): a breach that attracts penal consequences.The obligations under s 23(1) of the Act is for every employer to `insure and maintain insurance` against any liability which he may incur under the provisions of the Act to any workman employed by him. The Act does not stipulate the manner in which those obligations are to be fulfilled. Whether an employer takes out and maintains such a policy directly or whether he procures that the main contractor takes out and maintains such a policy, the net result would be that a policy of insurance covering that liability is in place. And that is what s 23(1) is concerned with - the protection of workmen by ensuring that there is in place a policy of insurance that ensures that compensation awarded in respect of injuries suffered in the course of their work is met.The Commissioner appears to have considered that since the obligations under s 23(1) were on the employer, it was the employer who had to `insureandmaintain` the required insurance cover. She took the view that it was not sufficient for the employer to show that there was in fact an insurance policy covering claims against him by his employees; the employer had, in addition, to show that (a) he had directly taken the policy; and (b) he was directly maintaining the policy.The Commissioner is correct in saying that the duty on the employer is to both insureandmaintain. If the employer insures himself against claims by injured workmen but fails to maintain that policy, the employer would be in breach of s 23(1). But in this case there had been no failure by De Kong to `insureandmaintain`. De Kong had a contractual arrangement with the Main Contractor to insure and maintain insurance to cover De Kong`s liability to its employees for any injuries suffered. To this end, the Main Contractor had taken out the AXA policy and that policy was maintained. The fact that it was maintained by the main contractor as a contractual obligation to the sub-contractor does not, in my view, detract from the fact that the required insurance was taken and maintained. So long as the employer had arranged for the policy to be issued and maintained and the policy was in fact issued and maintained, the employer would have fulfilled his  obligations under s 23(1). If the main contractor defaults in providing insurance cover to the sub-contractor as required by the sub-contract, or, having taken out the required cover fails to maintain it, the sub-contractor would be in breach of his obligations under s 23(1). It would be no answer, in those situations, for the sub-contractor to say that the fault was that of the main contractor.For the above reasons, I allow the appeal. As De Kong was covered by the AXA policy, the Citystate policy, although a valid policy under the Act, would not, because of the `non-contribution` clause, cover the compensation awarded in respect of the injuries to the 15 workmen. There can therefore be no recourse to Citystate. Recourse can only be had to AXA. The decision of the Commissioner is therefore set aside and it is ordered that AXA pay the compensation awarded. AXA is also to bear the costs of this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the Commissioner.Outcome:Appeal allowed.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
