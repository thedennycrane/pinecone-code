        "Introduction": "1 A collision between an oil tanker “A Symphony” and a general cargo vessel “Sea Justice” occurred off the port of Qingdao, the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”), within Chinese territorial waters (“Collision”). The respective vessel owners commenced and engaged in proceedings in the Qingdao Maritime Court (“QMC”) in relation to the Collision. Among others, the owner of the “Sea Justice” constituted a limitation fund for maritime claims and the owner of the “A Symphony” registered claims against that limitation fund. Both parties also commenced liability actions against each other. 2 Separately, the owner of the “A Symphony” commenced (quaplaintiff) HC/ADM 61/2021 (“ADM 61”) in Singapore as an admiralty actionin remagainst the “Sea Justice”. More than a year after the Collision, the “Sea Justice” sailed into Singapore waters and was arrested on the plaintiff’s application. The (by now former) owner of the “Sea Justice” entered an appearance (quadefendant) in ADM 61 and provided security for the release of the “Sea Justice”. 3 The plaintiff’s claim against the defendant in ADM 61 is for damages and indemnification from loss arising from the Collision. The defendant applied by HC/SUM 4434/2022 (“SUM 4434”) for, among others: (a) ADM 61 to be stayed in favour of the court proceedings in the PRC on the grounds offorum non conveniens; (b) the security it had provided in the Singapore action to be returned; and (c) the arrest of the “Sea Justice” to be set aside. The learned Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who heard SUM 4434 ordered theforum non conveniensstay and return of security but declined to set aside the arrest. The AR’s grounds of decision are set out inThe “Sea Justice”[2023] SGHCR 24. Parties filed cross-appeals against the AR’s decision. These are now before me. 4 HC/RA 246/2023 (“RA 246”) is the plaintiff’s appeal against the AR’s order that the security provided by the defendant for the release of the “Sea Justice” be returned. The plaintiffacceptsand hasnotappealed the AR’s decision that the Singapore proceedings should be stayed in favour of the QMC as the more appropriate forum for the plaintiff’s claims to be tried. The plaintiff has also made a considered decisionnotto ask that theforum non conveniensstay be imposed on the condition that the defendant provides alternative / equivalent security for the plaintiff’s QMC action. Instead, the plaintiff wants to retain the security provided for ADM 61. The issue arising is thus whether the plaintiff should be permitted to retain the security provided for ADM 61 notwithstanding theforum non conveniensstay of the Singapore action, the defendant’s constitution of a limitation fund in the PRC, and the plaintiff’s participation in ongoing limitation and liability proceedings in the PRC. 5 In RA 246, the plaintiff also appeals against the AR’s order that the plaintiff pay the defendant disbursements of S$88,786.53 towards the fees of the defendant’s Chinese law expert in SUM 4434. The plaintiff contends that this figure should be further discounted. 6 HC/RA 247/2023 (“RA 247”) is the defendant’s appeal against the AR’s decision not to set aside the arrest of the “Sea Justice”. The defendant maintains that the arrest should be set aside because the plaintiff failed to make full and frank disclosure of material facts in its application for a warrant of arrest.",
        "Facts": "",
        "The parties": "7 The plaintiff is Symphony Shipholding SA, a company incorporated in Liberia (“Plaintiff”). The Plaintiff was at all material times the registered owner of the “A Symphony”. The defendant is Sea Justice Ltd, a company incorporated in the Marshall Islands (“Defendant”). The Defendant was at all material times the registered owner of the “Sea Justice”.1Foot Note 1×The “Sea Justice”[2023] SGHCR 24 (“GD”) at [5]–[7].",
        "Background to the dispute": "8 On 27 April 2021, the Collision between the “A Symphony” and the “Sea Justice” occurred off the port of Qingdao, PRC.2Foot Note 2×1st Affidavit of Yu Changqing filed on behalf of the Defendant on 18 January 2023 (“1st YC Affidavit”) at para 8.Oil carried on board the “A Symphony” spilled into the ocean, causing a marine pollution incident.3Foot Note 3×2nd Affidavit of Eleftherios Tsouris filed on behalf of the Plaintiff on 17 January 2023 (“2nd ET Affidavit”) at p 53; Plaintiff’s Written Submissions dated 22 December 2023 (“PWS”) at para 9. 9 On 28 April 2021, the Plaintiff filed a writ of summons in Singapore to commence ADM 61. 10 On 30 April 2021, the Defendant applied to the QMC in the PRC to constitute a limitation fund for all maritime claims (other than those for loss of life or personal injury) that may be brought against the Defendant as a result of the Collision (“SJ Limitation Fund Application”).4Foot Note 4×1st YC Affidavit at para 20 and pp 81–85; GD at [10]. 11 On 6 May 2021, the Plaintiff commenced an actionin personamagainst the Defendant in the Marshall Islands in respect of the Collision.5Foot Note 5×2nd Affidavit of Yu Changqing filed on behalf of the Defendant on 7 December 2023 (“2nd YC Affidavit”) at p 68; GD at [21]. 12 On 8 May 2021, the Defendant commenced a claim against the Plaintiff in the QMC to determine the collision liability between the parties and for the Plaintiff to compensate the Defendant for its loss according to the apportioned collision liability (“Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim”).6Foot Note 6×1st YC Affidavit at para 30 and pp 126–131; GD at [11]. 13 From 27 to 29 May 2021, the QMC published notices in the People’s Court Daily calling for interested parties to object to the SJ Limitation Fund Application within specified times. The Plaintiff did not file any objections.7Foot Note 7×1st YC Affidavit at paras 21–23 and pp 102–103, 106–107 and 110–111; GD at [12]. 14 On 25 June 2021, the Plaintiff’s Protection and Indemnity (“P&I”) club, the North of England P&I Designated Activity Company (“NEPIA”), commenced proceedings in the QMC to constitute a limitation fund for “oil pollution damage compensation liability” arising out of the Collision pursuant to the 1992 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage (“AS CLC Limitation Fund”).8Foot Note 8×1st YC Affidavit at para 44; 2nd Affidavit of Corinne Lam filed on behalf of the Defendant on 15 December 2022 (“2nd CL Affidavit”) at p 67; GD at [13]. 15 On 12 July 2021, the QMC issued a Civil Ruling approving the SJ Limitation Fund Application.9Foot Note 9×1st YC Affidavit at para 23 and pp 116–118; GD at [14]. 16 On 20 and 21 July 2021, the Defendant constituted the limitation fund by paying a total of RMB39,536,501 (approximately US$6.1m) into the QMC (“SJ Limitation Fund”).10Foot Note 10×1st YC Affidavit at para 24; PWS at para 17(a). 17 On 26 July 2021, the Plaintiff applied to register its claims against the SJ Limitation Fund (“Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim against SJ Limitation Fund”).11Foot Note 11×1st Affidavit of Wang Yongli filed on behalf of the Plaintiff on 15 February 2023 (“1st WY Affidavit”) at pp 154–156; GD at [15]. 18 On 18 August 2021, the QMC approved the AS CLC Limitation Fund.12Foot Note 12×1st YC Affidavit at para 44; 2nd CL Affidavit at pp 66–73; GD at [16]. 19 On 27 August 2021, the QMC granted the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim against SJ Limitation Fund.13Foot Note 13×2nd ET Affidavit at para 20; GD at [15]. 20 On 27 August 2021, the Defendant applied to dismiss the Marshall Islands proceedings on the grounds of, among others,forum non conveniens.14Foot Note 14×2nd YC Affidavit at p 69; GD at [21]. 21 On 6 September 2021, the Plaintiff and NEPIA jointly commenced an action against the Defendant in the QMC to determine the collision liability between the parties and seek compensation for the losses suffered by the Plaintiff (“Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim”).15Foot Note 15×1st YC Affidavit at para 34 and pp 148–149 and 155–159; 1st WY Affidavit at pp 157–161; 2nd ET Affidavit at pp 96–100; GD at [17]. 22 On 12 October 2021, the Defendant applied to the QMC for a worldwide behaviour preservation order against the Plaintiff, which parties have likened to an application for an anti-suit injunction (“Defendant’s Chinese ASI Application”). The Defendant sought orders for the Plaintiff to: (a) withdraw its Marshall Islands action; and (b) be prohibited from initiating legal proceedings against the Defendant in the PRC or other countries or arresting the Defendant’s property in respect of the dispute arising from the Collision.16Foot Note 16×1st WY Affidavit at paras 14–15; 2nd ET Affidavit at p 106; GD at [22]. 23 On 17 February 2022, the QMC dismissed the Defendant’s Chinese ASI Application (“QMC’s ASI Dismissal Ruling”). The QMC held that the Plaintiff’s filing of the Marshall Islands lawsuit did not violate PRC laws, and that there was presently no evidence that the Plaintiff’s behaviour would make it difficult to enforce a Chinese court judgment or cause the Defendant’s legal rights and interests to be violated.17Foot Note 17×1st WY Affidavit at para 20 and p 152; 2nd ET Affidavit at p 111; GD at [23]. 24 On 18 March 2022, the Marshall Islands High Court dismissed the Plaintiff’s action on the grounds offorum non conveniens. The Plaintiff’s appeal against this decision was subsequently dismissed.18Foot Note 18×2nd YC Affidavit at p 85; GD at [21]. 25 On 18 April 2022, the Plaintiff and the Defendant filed their evidence in respect of the Plaintiff’s Inter-Ship Claim and the Defendant’s Inter-Ship Claim (together, the “Inter-Ship Claims”) in the QMC.19Foot Note 19×1st YC Affidavit at para 39; GD at [18]. 26 On 19 April 2022, the QMC heard and directed the Inter-Ship Claims to be consolidated. At that hearing, the Plaintiff’s PRC lawyers made oral submissions on the Plaintiff’s defence to liability for the Collision and on the evidence tendered by the Defendant (“19 April 2022 QMC Hearing”).20Foot Note 20×1st YC Affidavit at paras 32 and 40–41; 2nd YC Affidavit at para 25; GD at [19]. 27 On 27 May 2022, after the parties’ PRC lawyers had conferred on the evidence tendered by the parties, they jointly confirmed in writing to the QMC the authenticity of the evidence (“27 May 2022 QMC Joint Confirmation”).21Foot Note 21×1st YC Affidavit at para 42; 2nd CL Affidavit at pp 59–60; GD at [20].",
        "Procedural history in ADM 61": "28 As mentioned at [9] above, on 28 April 2021, the Plaintiff commenced ADM 61. The Plaintiff’s claim against the Defendant is for damages and indemnification from loss arising out of the Collision. 29 On 28 April 2022, the writ of summons was renewed for 12 months. 30 On 19 October 2022, the Plaintiff applied for a warrant of arrest against the “Sea Justice” (“Arrest Application”). The Plaintiff’s application was made under s 4(3) of the High Court (Admiralty Jurisdiction) Act 1961 (2020 Rev Ed) based on a maritime lien arising out of the Collision.22Foot Note 22×GD at [24].In support of the Arrest Application, the Plaintiff filed a solicitor’s affidavit (the 1st Affidavit of Liao Yanting) on 19 October 2022 enclosing in draft the 2nd Affidavit of Eleftherios Tsouris (which was eventually filed on 17 January 2023) (“Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit”). The Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit disclosed the following information about other court proceedings: (a) The Defendant had constituted the SJ Limitation Fund in the QMC.23Foot Note 23×2nd ET Affidavit at para 19. (b) The Plaintiff had applied to register a claim against the SJ Limitation Fund, and its application had been granted by the QMC.24Foot Note 24×2nd ET Affidavit at para 20.The Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit exhibited an English translation of the Plaintiff’s Application for Registration of Claim against SJ Limitation Fund. This English translation contained a reservation of rights in the following terms, which the Plaintiff also reproduced in the text of the Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit:25Foot Note 25×2nd ET Affidavit at para 21 and pp 93–95. This Application for Registration of Claim is a procedural application made in response to the application from Sea Justice Ltd for the constitution of a limitation fund for maritime claims. The Applicant hereby declares that all the matters described herein or referred hereto shall not be construed as the Applicant’s acknowledgement of any facts or liabilities,or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law, or waiver of any substantial or procedural defenses. The Applicant also reserves the right to object to the right of the Respondent to limit its liabilities and the limitation amounts. [emphasis added] It is undisputed that the phrase “or acceptance of jurisdiction of your court or application of law” (“Additional Words”) shouldnotbe present in an accurate English translation of the original Chinese document. In his grounds of decision, the AR described the phrase as “Missing Words” because it did not appear in the original Chinese document. I prefer to describe the phrase as “Additional Words” to reflect that it should not have featured in an accurate English translation. (c) The Plaintiff had filed a Statement of Claim (for Declaratory Action) dated 6 September 2021 in the QMC. The Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit exhibited an English translation of this Statement of Claim.26Foot Note 26×2nd ET Affidavit at para 22 and pp 96–100. (d) The Defendant had filed a case disputing collision liability on 8 May 2021 in the QMC.27Foot Note 27×2nd ET Affidavit at para 23. (e) The Plaintiff had commenced the Marshall Islands proceedings on 6 May 2021. The Defendant had applied to dismiss the action, and the Marshall Islands High Court had dismissed the action onforum non conveniensgrounds. The decision was (then) being appealed.28Foot Note 28×2nd ET Affidavit at paras 25 and 34. (f) The Defendant’s Chinese ASI Application had been dismissed by the QMC.29Foot Note 29×2nd ET Affidavit at paras 26–31. 31 On 19 October 2022, the Duty Registrar heard and approved the Arrest Application. He issued a warrant of arrest against the “Sea Justice” (“Warrant of Arrest”). 32 On 20 October 2022, the “Sea Justice” was arrested after she entered Singapore waters.30Foot Note 30×1st YC Affidavit at para 12.The writ in ADM 61 was also served on the Defendant. 33 On 21 October 2022, the Defendant entered an appearance in ADM 61. 34 On 18 November 2022, the Plaintiff and the Defendant reached an agreement for the Defendant to provide security in the form of: (a) payment into court of S$8,846,383 (being the equivalent of US$6.5m); and (b) a Letter of Undertaking issued by The Swedish Club dated 17 November 2022 undertaking to pay the Plaintiff sums due in respect of its claim in ADM 61 up to US$13.5m (together, the “SG Security”).31Foot Note 31×1st YC Affidavit at para 13 and pp 72–73. 35 On 19 November 2022, following the Defendant’s provision of the SG Security, the “Sea Justice” was released from arrest.32Foot Note 32×1st YC Affidavit at para 15. 36 On 13 December 2022, the Defendant filed SUM 4434 to apply for orders, among others, that (a) the Singapore action in ADM 61 be stayed in favour of the court proceedings in the PRC on the grounds offorum non conveniens; (b) the SG Security be returned to the Defendant; and (c) the Warrant of Arrest and execution and service thereof be set aside.",
        "Limitation of liability regimes in Singapore and the PRC": "37 Of particular relevance to SUM 4434 and the present appeals is the fact that Singapore and the PRC have different regimes for the limitation of liability of shipowners for maritime claims based on vessel tonnage. 38 Singapore implements the Protocol of 1996 (“1996 Protocol”) to amend the Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims 1976 (“1976 Convention”) domestically by way of Part VIII of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 (2020 Rev Ed). The 1996 Protocol increased the limits of liability under the 1976 Convention (see alsoCMA CGM SA and Another v The Ship Chou Shan and Another[2014] FCAFC 90 (“Chou Shan”) at [69]). 39 In contrast, the PRC is not a State party or signatory to any international convention on the limitation of liability for maritime claims. The Chinese limitation regime is enacted domestically by way of Ch 11 (titled “Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims”) of the Maritime Code of the PRC.33Foot Note 33×1st Affidavit of Chu Beiping filed on behalf of the Plaintiff on 15 February 2023 at exh “CBP-2”: Expert Opinion, Annex 1, pp 41–44.The substance of Ch 11 is taken from the 1976 Convention (see alsoChou Shanat [9]), save that the former does not adopt Art 13 of the 1976 Convention which provides for, among others, a bar to other actions by a person who has made a claim against a limitation fund constituted under Art 11.34Foot Note 34×Plaintiff’s Skeletal Submissions dated 11 January 2024 (“2nd PWS”) at para 17. 40 It is undisputed that the limits of liability (quantum-wise) are higher under the Singapore limitation regime than under the Chinese limitation regime.35Foot Note 35×GD at [50].The total value of the SG Security is pegged to the maximum that the Plaintiff would be allowed to claim under Singapore’s limitation framework.36Foot Note 36×GD at [108].",
        "Decision below": "",
        "Order for forum non conveniens stay": "41 The AR held that the Singapore action should be stayed on the grounds offorum non conveniensin favour of the QMC proceedings.37Foot Note 37×GD at [121].At the first stage of the test inSpiliada Maritime Corporation v Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460 (“Spiliada”), he found that the QMC was the more appropriate forum for the Plaintiff’s claims to be tried.38Foot Note 38×GD at [45]–[106].At the second stage of the test,viz, whether justice required that a stay should nonetheless not be granted, he rejected the Plaintiff’s argument that it would lose the juridical advantage of the SG Security if the Singapore action were stayed. The practical effect of the Plaintiff losing the SG Security was no different from losing the benefit of the higher limit of liability in Singapore. The Plaintiff’s argument attempted to sidestep the fact that the existence of different limitation regimes is not an advantage under the second stage of theSpiliadatest given international comity (citingThe “Reecon Wolf”[2012] 2 SLR289 (“Reecon Wolf”) at [55]). Further, accepting the Plaintiff’s argument would force the Defendant to potentially set up a limitation fund in Singapore, contrary to its right to claim limitation in its choice of forum (citingEvergreen International SA v Volkswagen Group Singapore Pte Ltd and others[2004] 2 SLR(R) 457(“Evergreen”) at [47]).39Foot Note 39×GD at [107]–[120].",
        "Order for return of SG Security": "42 The AR stayed the Singapore proceedings unconditionally and ordered the return of the SG Security.40Foot Note 40×GD at [160] and [162].He held that the grant of theforum nonconveniensstay required the return of the SG Security as there was no longer a pending claim here. He also citedThe “Putbus”[1969] P 136 (“Putbus”) for the proposition that a shipowner, having constituted a limitation fund to answer collision claims, should not be compelled to put up further security in another country for the same claims. He held that allowing the Plaintiff to retain the SG Security would usurp the Defendant’s choice of forum for its limitation action.41Foot Note 41×GD at [147]–[150]. 43 The AR further rejected the Plaintiff’s proposal for a “conditional stay” or “case management stay” (with attendant retention of the SG Security) where the stay could be lifted for the Plaintiff to enforce any Chinese judgment obtained so as to claim damages it could not claim against the SJ Limitation Fund.42Foot Note 42×GD at [29].He held that such an order would allow the Plaintiff to be doubly secured in Singapore and in the PRC. It would also go against comity as it would be tantamount to finding that the Chinese limitation regime was inadequate compared with that of Singapore.43Foot Note 43×GD at [151]–[157].As for the Plaintiff’s argument that it was unclear whether its oil pollution indemnity claims against the Defendant would fall within the SJ Limitation Fund, the Plaintiff had not proven that these claims were not subject to the SJ Limitation Fund. The Plaintiff had in fact already registered these claims against the SJ Limitation Fund.44Foot Note 44×GD at [158]–[159].",
        "Order dismissing the Defendant’s application to set aside the arrest": "44 The AR found that the non-disclosures by the Plaintiff were, although relevant, immaterial.45Foot Note 45×GD at [161].He held that whether the Plaintiff had reserved its rights when it registered its claim against the SJ Limitation Fund was relevant. A reservation of rights signalled that the Plaintiff was intent to proceed with the Singapore and not QMC action. The fact that the Plaintiff had participated in the Chinese proceedings without any express reservation or objection to the QMC’s jurisdiction was inconsistent with what the Plaintiff told the Duty Registrar in the Arrest Application. However, the AR noted the opinion of the Plaintiff’s Chinese law expert, Prof Chu Beiping (“Prof Chu”), that the Plaintiff could still challenge the QMC’s jurisdiction by making a “procedural defence”. The AR found that the lack of the Additional Words (see [30(b)] above) in the actual Chinese reservation of rights clause was thus not material to the grant of the Warrant of Arrest.46Foot Note 46×GD at [137] and [140]–[143].He also opined that every proceeding in the QMC preceding the hearing of the Arrest Application should have been disclosed. However, the impact of not disclosing more was not significant. He therefore exercised his discretion not to set aside the Warrant of Arrest.47Foot Note 47×GD at [144]–[145].",
        "Order for the Plaintiff to pay the Defendant’s Chinese law expert’s fees": "45 The AR awarded the costs of SUM 4434 to the Defendant. He allowed disbursements of S$88,786.53 for the fees of the Defendant’s Chinese law expert, Prof Zhao Jinsong (“Prof Zhao”). The parties had adduced Chinese law expert evidence for theforum non conveniensstay application, on which the Defendant succeeded. Prof Zhao’s bill was for S$110,983.17. The AR went through the entries in his bill and found his fees to be reasonable and reasonably incurred. However, a reduction of Prof Zhao’s fees was in order. Prof Zhao had rendered five reports. His first report and part of his second report related to the issue of submission to jurisdiction of the Chinese courts. They accounted for the bulk of his costs. His third, fourth and fifth reports were on other issues. The AR found Prof Zhao’s opinion on the issue of submission to jurisdiction difficult to follow as it was diametrically opposite to the opinion Prof Zhao had rendered in another case. The first and second reports were thus of limited value. This did not mean that all of Prof Zhao’s work in rendering his opinion on the issue of submission to jurisdiction should be negated. However, his fees should be reduced on account of the limited value derived from his opinion on this issue. A 20% reduction on his fees, to S$88,786.53, was appropriate.48Foot Note 48×Certified Transcript of hearing of SUM 4434 on 3 November 2023 at p 5 line 30–p 6 line 31.",
        "The parties’ cases on appeal": "46 I set out a brief overview of the parties’ positions in these appeals, to be elaborated at the relevant junctures. 47 The Plaintiff did not appeal against theforum non conveniensstay order. Notwithstanding that, the Plaintiff submitted that the SG Security should be retained. This is to satisfy any amounts under any Chinese judgment the Plaintiff might obtain against the Defendant and which might not be satisfied out of the SJ Limitation Fund. Next, the Plaintiff submitted that the AR rightly exercised his discretion not to set aside the arrest of the “Sea Justice” as the non-disclosed matters were immaterial to the Duty Registrar’s decision whether to issue the Warrant of Arrest. Finally, the Plaintiff’s counsel clarified at the hearing of RA 246 that its appeal against the AR’s costs order is confined to the disbursements of S$88,786.53 allowed for Prof Zhao’s fees.49Foot Note 49×Notes of Arguments of RA 246 and RA 247 hearing on 12 January 2024 (“NOA”) at p 14 lines 31–32.The Plaintiff argued for a 70%–80% reduction of Prof Zhao’s fees. 48 The Defendant opposed the retention of the SG Security on the grounds that (a) there is no legal basis to maintain the SG Security given the grant of theforum non conveniensstay; (b) the Plaintiff will be doubly secured should the SG Security be retained; and (c) the retention of the SG Security would go against international comity. Next, the Defendant submitted that the AR’s discretion not to set aside the arrest of the “Sea Justice” was incorrectly exercised as the Plaintiff’s non-disclosures were material and deliberate. Finally, the Defendant submitted that the AR’s costs order was within his discretion and should not be disturbed.",
        "Issues to be determined": "49 The three main issues to be determined are: (a) in RA 246: whether the SG Security should be retained by the Plaintiff;(b) in RA 247: whether the arrest of the “Sea Justice” should be set aside; and(c) in RA 246: whether the disbursements allowed for Prof Zhao’s fees, in the amount of S$88,786.53, should be further reduced.",
        "Issue 1: Whether the SG Security should be retained by the Plaintiff": "",
        "The Plaintiff’s case": "150 The Plaintiff submitted that the AR erred in finding that only “a small reduction of 20%” of Prof Zhao’s fees was warranted despite finding that Prof Zhao’s evidence on the issue of submission to jurisdiction of the Chinese courts could not be relied on as he gave a diametrically opposing view in another case and provided no explanation for his change in opinion.127Foot Note 127×PWS at paras 4(b), 76–78; 2nd PWS at para 35.The Plaintiff submitted that the work done by Prof Zhao in preparing his first and second reports “should be entirely disregarded, or at the very least, that a much higher reduction of 70%–80% should have been imposed on Prof Zhao’s fees”.128Foot Note 128×PWS at para 78; 2nd PWS at para 36.",
        "The Defendant’s case": "151 The Defendant pointed toKiri Industries Ltd v Senda International Capital Ltd and another[2022] 3 SLR 174 (“Kiri”) where the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) held that expert witness fees are generally recoverable as long as they are reasonably incurred (at [102]); and toCentre for Laser and Aesthetic Medicine Pte Ltd v GPK Clinic (Orchard) PteLtd and others and another appeal[2018] 1 SLR 180 (“GPK”) where the Court of Appeal held that “the fact that an expert’s views were ultimately not accepted in full by the court does not mean that the costs of engaging the expert were unreasonably incurred” (at [96]). The Defendant submitted that while the AR did not rely on Prof Zhao’s opinion on the issue of submission to jurisdiction, it was within his discretion to find that Prof Zhao’s fees were reasonably incurred.129Foot Note 129×DWS at paras 99–101.",
        "Decision": "152 In addition to the legal propositions cited by the Defendant at [151] above, inGPK, the successful plaintiff was allowed to recover its expert’s fees despite the trial judge rejecting the plaintiff’s expert’s method of computing damages. The Court of Appeal held that the trial judge, who had the benefit of hearing the expert’s testimony, found his costs to be reasonably incurred, and the Court of Appeal saw no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding (at [96]). InKiri, the SICC drew a distinction between the situation where the costs associated with expert evidence were unreasonably incurred, and a situation where the expert evidence was reasonably sought (and the associated fees were reasonably incurred) but was eventually not accepted by the court. In the latter case, the party would still be entitled to disbursements (at [102]). 153 In the present case, the Plaintiff’s position is not that Prof Zhao’s fees were excessive or unreasonable in amount, or that the costs were for work that should not have been done in the first place. Rather, the Plaintiff’s objection is that Prof Zhao’s evidence on the issue of whether the Plaintiff had submitted to the jurisdiction of the QMC was inconsistent and was not relied on by the AR in this respect. However, the AR also found that the issue was not completely addressed by the Plaintiff’s Chinese law expert and ultimately made no finding on whether the Plaintiff had submitted to the jurisdiction of the QMC.130Foot Note 130×GD at [82] and [99]–[102].This issue pertained to theforum non conveniensanalysis. 154 Theforum non conveniensstay application is not the subject of challenge in the appeals before me. I have not had to consider the parties’ Chinese law experts’ opinions in relation toforum non conveniensissues. The person best placed to make an assessment of the value derived from Prof Zhao’s opinions is thus the AR. Particularly in these circumstances, due weight must be given to his decision (see alsoTan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David[2013] 4 SLR 718at [22]). In my view, the AR undertook a reasoned and thorough assessment, in line with the relevant legal principles, of the disbursements to be allowed for Prof Zhao’s fees. I see no basis for interfering with the exercise of his discretion. Further, no copy of Prof Zhao’s bill was placed before me in RA 246.

        "Relevant legal principles": "137 It is settled law in Singapore that non-disclosure of material facts is an independent ground for setting aside an arrest:The “Rainbow Spring”[2003] 3 SLR(R) 362 at [35] and [37];The “Vasiliy Golovnin”[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“Vasiliy”) at [84]. 138 The test of materiality is whether the fact is relevant to the making of the decision whether or not to issue the warrant of arrest,ie, a fact which should properly be taken into consideration when weighing all the circumstances of the case, though it need not have the effect of leading to a different decision being made:Vasiliyat [85]–[86], citingThe “Damavand”[1993] 2 SLR(R) 136 at [30]. The test for materiality is objective:Vasiliyat [87]. At the stage of an application for a warrant of arrest, the court is concerned with disclosure of material facts which (a) are germane to considerations of jurisdictionin rem; and (b) show that the application does not constitute an abuse of the arrest process:The “Eagle Prestige”[2010] 3 SLR 294 (“Eagle Prestige”) at [74], [81] and [84]. The existence of foreign proceedings in respect of the same claim brought in the local forum has been held to be a material fact that should be disclosed as it would otherwise obscure the inevitable consequence that proceedings in the local forum would be stayed or that jurisdiction would be declined:Vasiliyat [98], citingThe “Kherson”[1992] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 261 at 268. 139 However, even where there has been material non-disclosure, the court retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside the arrest:Vasiliyat [84], citingThe “Fierbinti”[1994] 3 SLR(R) 574 at [41]. In exercising this discretion, the court will apply the principle of proportionality in assessing the sin of omission against the impact of such default. This requires a measured assessment of the material facts as well as the circumstances in which the application for arrest was made:Vasiliyat [84]. Where non-disclosure was deliberate, the court would exercise its discretion not to set aside the arrest only in a special case:Treasure Valley Group Ltd v Saputra Teddy and another (Ultramarine Holdings Ltd, intervener)[2006] 1 SLR(R) 358 at [23].",
