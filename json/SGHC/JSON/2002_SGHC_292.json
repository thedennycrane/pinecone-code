        "Arguments and my reasons": "7.        Mr\n\nLim Kim Song, Counsel for both the Plaintiffs, submitted that as CLP was the only one of\n\nthe three joint tenants to sign the Option, the Option was incomplete and unperfected. He\n\nrelied heavily on the decision of the Court of Appeal inMookka Pillai Rajagopal &\n\nOrs v Khushvinder Singh Chopra[1996] 3 SLR 457. However, it is important to\n\nunderstand the facts there.8.        In\n\nthat case, there were three joint tenants of a property known as 91 Jalan Seaview. The\n\nfirst appellant was the father of the second appellant. The third appellant was the wife\n\nof the second appellant. An option was granted to the respondent to purchase this\n\nproperty, the respondent being an advocate and solicitor. The option was expressed to be\n\ngiven by the three appellants but only the second and third appellants signed it (see p\n\n459 at G of the law report). It was on these facts that L P Thean JA said at p 462:‘The option was intended to\n\n    be given and signed by the three appellants, who held and still hold the property as joint\n\n    tenants. It was signed by only two of them. Neither of them purported to sign the option\n\n    on behalf of the first appellant. It was an incomplete or unperfected option and was\n\n    ineffective as an option to the respondent to purchase the property. It follows from this\n\n    that when the respondent exercised the option on 25 October 1993 there did not arise an\n\n    agreement between the appellants and the respondent for the sale and purchase of the\n\n    property. At any rate, the option was certainly not binding on the first appellant, and on\n\n    that date there was no agreement binding on him to sell or join in the sale of the\n\n    property to the respondent, whatever might be the effect of the agreement, if any, that\n\n    was made between on the one hand the respondent and on the other hand the second and third\n\n    appellants - we shall refer to this as the unperfected agreement - and their liability\n\n    thereunder.’9.        At p\n\n467, Thean JA also said:‘…. The option signed\n\n    by the second and third appellants were an incomplete or unperfected option and the\n\n    respondent’s purported exercise thereof did not result in an agreement. At any rate,\n\n    assuming that by the exercise of the option, a binding agreement was made with the second\n\n    and third appellants, the agreement was not binding on the first appellant. The property\n\n    being held by the three appellants as joint tenants, such an agreement was not effective\n\n    to dispose of the entire property in favour of the respondent. The respondent would have\n\n    serious difficulty in enforcing the agreement even as against the second and third\n\n    appellants. It seems to us that, at the most, he would be able to recover only the\n\n    consideration paid for the option.’10.        \n\nRelying on the passage I have cited from p 467, Mr Lim submitted that the Option before me\n\nwas also incomplete and unperfected. However, it seemed to me that inMookka Pillai,\n\nthe option was incomplete and unperfected because it purported to emanate from all three\n\njoint tenants but only two had signed. Even then, Thean JA was prepared to consider the\n\npossibility that it might still constitute a binding agreement on the second and third\n\nappellants. I would add that inMookka Pillai, the main substantive issue before\n\nthe Court of Appeal was whether the respondent purchaser had exercised undue influence on\n\nthe appellants or any one or more of them (see p 462 at B of the law report). Indeed both\n\nMs Lee and Mr Lim informed me that the three cases listed in p 458 of the law report were\n\non undue influence.11.        In\n\nthe course of submissions, Ms Lee also drew my attention to another decision of our Court\n\nof Appeal inTay Joo Sing v Ku Yu Sang[1994] 3 SLR 719. In that case, two brothers\n\nTay Joo Sing and Tay Joo Meng were tenants-in-common in equal shares of a commercial unit\n\nin Lucky Plaza, Orchard Road, Singapore, known as B1-124 (‘No 124’). They had\n\ntried to sell No 124 as far back as 1985 but were not successful. Joo Meng then emigrated\n\nto Australia and left the sale to Joo Sing. Eventually Joo Sing purported to sell No 124\n\nto a purchaser Ku Yu Sang. For this purpose, a document prepared by a property broker was\n\nsigned. It was referred to as ‘PB1’ and it stated:‘Mr Tay Joo Sing and Mr Tay\n\n    Joo Meng48 Marshall RoadSingapore 15422 May 1987Re: B1-24 Lucky Plaza, 304\n\n    Orchard Road, Singapore 0923This is to confirm that we, Mr\n\n    Tay Joo Sing and Mr Tay Joo Meng, owners of the abovementioned property, hereby agree to\n\n    sell to Mr Ku Yu Sang, NRIC No 1841358B, at the purchase price of SGD470,000 (Singapore\n\n    Dollars Four Hundred Seventy Thousand only).We hereby confirm that we have\n\n    received a deposit of SGD5,000 (DBS 588590) only as part of option fee.This contract is valid for 14\n\n    days only.This property is sold with vacant\n\n    possession.Seller’s signatureMr Tay Joo Sing (IC No 0068340Z)Buyer’s signatureMr Ku Yu Sang (IC No 1841358B)WitnessMr Victor CT Sim (IC No\n\n    1461894E)’The number of ‘B1-24’\n\nshould have referred to ‘B1-124’ but this was not material.12.        On\n\n4 May 1987, Joo Sing’s solicitors informed Yu Sang’s solicitors that he was not\n\nagreeable to selling the property to Yu Sang and the cheque for $5,000 was returned.\n\nHowever, Yu Sang would not accept this position and, on his instructions, his solicitors\n\nsent to Joo Sing’s solicitors a cheque for $42,000 being the balance of the 10% of\n\nthe purchase price, in accordance with his understanding of the agreement reached with Joo\n\nSing on 2 May 1987 and also retendered the earlier cheque for $5,000. On 16 May 1987, Joo\n\nSing’s solicitors returned both cheques to Yu Sang’s solicitors. Yu Sang’s\n\nattempts to resolve the dispute not being successful, he commenced action on 30 June 1989.13.        Yu\n\nSang’s claim was firstly against both brothers for specific performance and secondly\n\nagainst Joo Sing for specific performance of Joo Sing’s undivided half share in No\n\n124, and damages.14.        Joo\n\nSing denied that he had represented to Yu Sang that Joo Meng had authorised him to sell No\n\n124. He also raised other defences but it is not necessary for me to specify them.15.        On\n\nthese facts, the Court of Appeal found that looking at PB1 alone, Joo Sing had offered to\n\nsell No 124 to Yu Sang for $470,000 on his own behalf as well as on behalf of Joo Meng\n\n(see p 727 at I of the law report).16.        \n\nApparently this case was not cited to the Court of Appeal inMookka Pillai. In any\n\nevent, it also appears that inTay Joo Sing, no argument was made to the effect\n\nthat PB1 was in fact an incomplete and unperfected option on the ground that it purported\n\nto emanate from two persons but was signed by only one of them. Indeed, Joo Sing did not\n\nsign twice i.e once for himself and once on behalf of Joo Meng. Had that argument been\n\nraised, the Court of Appeal might have concluded that PB1 was incomplete and unperfected\n\nor that such an option might be binding only on the person signing it.17.        In\n\nthe case before me, the facts were different from those inTay Joo SingandMookka\n\nPillai. The Option did not purport to emanate from all three joint tenants but one\n\nonly i.e CLP. True he did not have full title to the Property but, in my view, that was a\n\nseparate matter. The beginning of the Option stated:‘\n\n        OPTION TO PURCHASETo:FONG YOKE SAN (S1739971C)From:MR CHAN LEE PAKWOK SING CHEONG (S1714489H)  \n\n        &/OR NOMINEESNo.50 JALAN LEMBAH THOMSONSINGAPORE\n\n        577520APT BLK 287D JURONG EAST ST 21\n\n        #14-316 S(604287)’S0138196B18.        At\n\nthe end of the Option, only CLP signed:‘SIGNED by the Vendor)Name: Chan Lee Pa)[Signature of CLP]NRIC No.: 01381916)'19.        In\n\nmy view, the Option was complete and binding on CLP as a contract. Had the Plaintiffs\n\nexercised the Option, CLP would have been obliged to complete the sale and purchase by\n\nprocuring the other two joint tenants to execute the instrument of transfer together with\n\nhim. If he could not do so, he would have been in breach of contract vis--vis the\n\nPlaintiffs who would have been entitled to sue him for damages.20.        On\n\nthe last point, Mr Lim submitted that inMookka Pillai, Thean JA had said that the\n\npurchaser would be able to recover only the consideration paid for the option. However, it\n\nmust be borne in mind that this was because the primary view there in respect of that\n\noption was that that option was incomplete and unperfected. If an option was complete and\n\nvalid, I did not see why the person who had the benefit of the option would be unable to\n\nsue on it.21.        \n\nIndeed, that was the outcome inMalhotra v Choudhury[1979] 1 All ER 186, which Ms\n\nLee relied on. In that case, an option to purchase a property was granted by the defendant\n\nto the plaintiff but the property was owned by the defendant and his wife as joint\n\ntenants. The plaintiff gave notice that he intended to exercise the option but the\n\ndefendant asserted that the option was not exercisable and refused to sell the property.\n\nThe plaintiff then commenced an action seeking specific performance of the option.\n\nEventually, the defendant was ordered by the English Court of Appeal to pay substantial\n\ndamages.22.        Mr\n\nLim also sought to rely on s 6(d) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43) which states:‘6. No action shall be\n\n    brought against -(d) any person upon any contract\n\n      for the sale or other disposition of immovable property, or any interest in such property;(e) ….unless the promise or agreement\n\n    upon which such action is brought, or some memorandum or note thereof, is in writing and\n\n    signed by the party to be charged therewith or some other person lawfully authorised by\n\n    him.’23.        In\n\nmy view, this provision did not assist the Plaintiffs. If they had exercised the Option\n\nand if CLP was unable to complete the sale, the Plaintiffs would have been able to bring\n\nan action against CLP, although not against the other two joint tenants.24.        It\n\nseemed to me that the existence of a valid contract should not be confused with its\n\nperformance. In my view, it is not necessary for a person granting the option to be the\n\nfull legal owner of the property in question at the time the option is granted or when the\n\noption is exercised, before the option can be said to be binding on him.25.        For\n\nexample, if, A, the owner of a property, grants an option to purchase to B and before B\n\nexercises the option, B grants an option to purchase to C, there is a binding obligation\n\non B vis--vis C even though B is not the legal owner of the property.26.        In\n\naddition, even if B does not have a legally enforceable right against A at the time B\n\ngrants an option to purchase to C, there is still a binding obligation on B vis--vis C.\n\nTherefore, if, for example, A is the mother of B and A tells B that she will give or sell\n\na property in Singapore to him when she returns to Singapore in four weeks’ time, B\n\ndoes not need to wait for A to return to Singapore, although it would be prudent for him\n\nto do so in case something happens to A or A changes her mind.27.        On\n\nthe other hand, in some cases, it may be obvious after an option is granted that the\n\nperson granting the option will not be able to complete the sale in any event. For\n\nexample, the person granting the option is not the owner of the property and has no\n\ncontractual or other relationship with the owner which will cause the owner to complete\n\nthe sale. In such a case, there might be an anticipatory breach of contract by the person\n\ngranting the option, but the point is that there is a binding obligation on him which\n\nentitles the other contracting party to sue him if he defaults.28.        On\n\nthe facts before me, it was not suggested that CLP would be unable to complete the sale\n\nsince the other two joint tenants had made it clear that they were able, willing and ready\n\nto be parties to the Option and consequently to complete the sale, if the Option was\n\nexercised. Instead, the Plaintiffs’ argument was that the Option was incomplete and\n\nunperfected.29.        In\n\nthe circumstances, I was of the view that the Plaintiffs were trying to take advantage of\n\nthe situation but the Plaintiffs had no legal basis to seek the refund of the option fee.\n\nAccordingly, the Plaintiffs’ claim was dismissed with costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
