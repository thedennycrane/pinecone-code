        "Introduction": "1. This was an application brought by Ng Chu Chong (‘the\n\nplaintiff’), under Order 14 of The Rules of Court, for a permanent injunction\n\nrestraining Ng Swee Choon, Chian Han Chuan, Oh Han Kiong, Chan Yuen Hou and Chian Lian\n\nFong, trading as GA Fashion Apparel (‘the defendants’) from dealing in or with\n\nthe trademark \"McBlue\". I granted the injunction and such other orders as\n\napplied for; the defendants have now appealed against my decision (in Civil Appeal No. 5\n\nof 2001).",
        "Facts": "2. The plaintiff is the brother of Ng Swee Choon (‘the first\n\ndefendant’). On 15 July 1987, the plaintiff and the first defendant entered into a\n\npartnership called \"Grand Am Fashion Enterprise\" ('Grand Am'). It was the first\n\ndefendant who had created the name of the business. Grand Am was to manufacture and to\n\nsell fashion apparel under various trademarks, including the trademark \"McBlue\".\n\nOn 10 September 1987, the first defendant and the plaintiff trading as Grand Am, were\n\nentered by the Registry of Trademarks as the joint proprietors of the McBlue trademark.\n\nThe trademark was then renewed on 10 September 1994 for a further period of 10 years to\n\nexpire in 2004. The business grew and the partnership was able to establish accounts in\n\nvarious major departmental stores in Singapore such as Seiyu, Carrefour, Isetan and Metro.3. However sometime between 1997 and 1998, a statutory demand to pay a\n\nsum of approximately $1.51 million was served by Far East Finance Organization on the\n\nfirst defendant. She was unable to discharge her debts and a receiving and adjudication\n\norder was then made against her on 9 October 1998. The first defendant was aware that she\n\ncould not remain as a partner of Grand Am if she were to be declared as a bankrupt. Hence,\n\nas early as 31 December 1997, she had voluntarily withdrawn from the partnership. The\n\nwithdrawal was filed in Form D (Statement of Changes in Business under the Business\n\nRegistration Act) on 23 September 1998. Subsequent searches in the Registry of Businesses\n\nrevealed that Grand Am was now registered as a sole-proprietorship in the plaintiff’s\n\nname. Both the second and the first defendants, who are incidentally husband and wife,\n\ncontinued to work for the sole-proprietorship as the managing director and product manager\n\nrespectively.4. On 18 July 2001, the plaintiff’s wife was informed by an\n\nemployee of Carrefour’s Accounts Department that the Grand Am account was to be\n\nclosed and taken over by a company called \"GA Fashion Apparel\" (‘GA’).\n\nThe buyer for Carrefour was led to believe that the first and second defendants were the\n\nactual owners of Grand Am. According to the plaintiff, investigations with other\n\ndepartmental store buyers also revealed that the first and second defendants had\n\nmisrepresented to them that they were the actual owners of Grand Am, that Grand Am and GA\n\nwere one and the same entity and, that GA would be the new suppliers. I might add at this\n\njuncture that these claims were strenuously resisted by the first and second defendants.\n\nBoth said that such representations were unnecessary in view of their close personal\n\nrelationships with the buyers of the various departmental stores as the stores would have\n\nbeen aware that Grand Am and GA were separate entities. A search conducted upon GA showed\n\nthat the firm was a partnership registered on 7 February 2001 in the names of Chan Yuen\n\nHou and Chian Lian Fong (the fourth and fifth defendants respectively). One of the\n\npartners, Chian Lian Fong is the sister-in-law of the first defendant. The plaintiff also\n\ndiscovered that GA would be making a delivery to Carrefour on the following day.5. Consequently, on 19 July 2001, the plaintiff went down to the\n\ndepartmental store and saw the second and third defendants, delivering goods bearing the\n\n\"McBlue\" trademark logo under GA invoices and purchase orders. He confiscated\n\nthe GA invoices, purchase orders as well as the box of stocks and proceeded to make a\n\npolice report. The plaintiff then initiated the present proceedings against the defendants\n\non the basis that the defendants had infringed upon the McBlue trademark. He applied for a\n\npermanent injunction to restrain them from further infringement and such other\n\nconsequential orders as necessary. The third defendant, on the instructions of GA, also\n\nfiled a police report on the 20 July 2001 claiming that the plaintiff wrongfully took\n\npossession of the goods and thereby converted them.",
        "The dispute": "6. There were numerous points in dispute between the parties. First,\n\nthe plaintiff and the first defendant disagreed as to the consequences of the first\n\ndefendant’s withdrawal as a partner. According to the plaintiff, it was agreed\n\nbetween the parties that the plaintiff would continue running the business of Grand Am as\n\na sole- proprietorship and the first defendant was to remain in his employment to help\n\nclear the debts of the dissolved partnership. On the other hand, the first and second\n\ndefendants denied that there was any such agreement. The first defendant claimed that the\n\nplaintiff had agreed to pay her share of the partnership to her, including the capital sum\n\nof $91,614.70, which she had initially invested in the business, and that there was no\n\ncontract of employment between the parties. At best, she and her husband (the second\n\ndefendant) were working for Grand Am on a free-lance basis and drawing an allowance. They\n\nwere also entitled to engage in any other business activity as they wished. The second\n\ndefendant also claimed that the partnership business was never transferred to the\n\nplaintiff.7. Secondly, the first defendant also alleged that the plaintiff had\n\nused the partnership name of \"Grand Am Fashion Enterprise\" for his\n\nsole-proprietorship without her consent or agreement.8. Thirdly, the parties disagreed on the ownership of the McBlue\n\ntrademark. The plaintiff argued that the first defendant had transferred her proprietary\n\ninterest in the trademark to him upon the dissolution of the partnership. In support of\n\nthis contention, he relied upon a letter from Grand Am to the Inland Revenue Authority\n\ndated 25 November 1999, signed by both the first defendant and himself, confirming that\n\nthe business was to be transferred to him on 31 December 1997 as agoing concern.\n\nTherefore, the right to use and to deal in any way with the McBlue trademark was vested in\n\nthe plaintiff absolutely. Further and in the alternative, even if the first defendant was\n\ncorrect in claiming that she was still a co-owner of the trademark, what she had was at\n\nbest, a right to use the trademark for the sole purpose and benefit of Grand Am under the\n\n1992 Trademarks Act (Cap 332). This right was exceeded when she authorized GA to market\n\ngoods bearing the McBlue trademark. The first defendant, in turn, relied upon the\n\ncertificate issued by the Registry of Trademarks to show that she remained as a joint\n\nproprietor of the trademark even after the dissolution of the partnership. The trademark\n\nwas personal and not partnership property. Furthermore, there was no evidence to show that\n\nshe had assigned her equal undivided interest in the trademark to the plaintiff. Therefore\n\nshe was entitled, in accordance with s 37 of the Trademarks Act (1999 ed) (the Act), to\n\nuse and to authorize GA to deal in goods bearing the McBlue trademark.",
        "The issues": "9. I was of the view that only the first and third points were relevant\n\ntowards the determination of the essential issue in this application which was, whether\n\nthe plaintiff is entitled to permanently injunct the defendants from dealing with and in\n\ngoods bearing the McBlue trademark. I shall not concern myself with determining the\n\nvalidity of the counterclaims that the first defendant had raised against the plaintiff in\n\nthe main suit. Limiting myself to this present application, the following issues hence\n\nfell to be determined:(a) whether the trademark was partnership or personal property;(b) the consequences of the dissolution of the partnership and its effect upon\n\nownership of the trademark;(c) whether there was infringement of the trademark by the defendants.10. The situation was slightly complicated by the fact that the\n\nRegister of Trademarks continues, even after the dissolution of the partnership, to\n\nreflect both the plaintiff and the first defendant as the joint proprietors of the\n\ntrademark. In addition, the 1992 Trademarks Act under which the trademark was originally\n\nregistered, was replaced by the Act which provided for a scheme of co-ownership\n\nsubstantially different from the previous position. With this in mind, I shall now take\n\neach issue in turn.",
        "Was the trademark partnership or personal property?": "11. Section 20(1) of the Partnership Act (Cap 391) states thatAll property and rights and interests in property originally brought\n\n  into the partnership stock or acquired, whether by purchase or otherwise, on account of\n\n  the firm, or for the purposes and in the course of the partnership business, are called in\n\n  this Actpartnership property, and must be held and applied by the partners\n\n  exclusively for the purposes of the partnership and in accordance with the partnership\n\n  agreement (emphasis added).It seemed clear to me that the trademark was, prior to the dissolution\n\nof the partnership, partnership property. Several factors pointed towards this conclusion.\n\nFirst the certificate of registration was granted to \"Ng Chu Chong and Ng Swee Choontrading\n\nas Grand Am\" as opposed to both of them individually. The applicable Act at the\n\ntime when the trademark was first registered in 1987 and then renewed for another 10 years\n\nin 1994 was the 1992 Trademarks Act. It bears remembering that under the 1992 Trademarks\n\nAct, co-ownership of registered trademarks was closely circumscribed. Section 12(12)\n\nstated that two or more persons who use or propose to use a trademark independently cannot\n\nbe registered as joint proprietors of the trademark. The only exception to this general\n\nprinciple was s 12(11). Section 12(11) made it clear that co-ownership is only allowed\n\nunder the Act if the \"relations between two or more persons interested in a\n\ntrademark are such that no one of them is entitled as between himself and the other or\n\nothers to use the trademark except on behalf of both or all of them or in relation to\n\ngoods or services with which both or all of them are connected in the course of trade\".\n\nTrademarks could only be registered in joint names when the parties are in partnership\n\nwith one another. Therefore there was a strong inference that the trademark was\n\npartnership as opposed to personal, property.12. Secondly, the trademark was created and registered after the\n\nformation of the partnership. It was also evident that the common intention of the parties\n\nat that time was to use the McBlue trademark on the fashion apparel produced or imported\n\nby Grand Am. This much was admitted by the first defendant when she said that the\n\ntrademark was created by her for the partnership. The trademark was hence prima facie a\n\nproperty interest that was acquired for the purposes and in the course of the partnership\n\nbusiness. Thirdly, the fact that the trademark was not registered solely in the name of\n\nGrand Am was merely a consequence of the well established legal principle that the\n\npartnership, as opposed to a company, is not recognized as a distinct legal entity but as\n\nan aggregate of its partners. The partnership cannot hold property separately in its own\n\nname, but must do so via its partners collectively (seeAlagappa Chettiar v Coliseum\n\nCaf[1962] 28 MLJ 11). This however, was not to be interpreted as evidence that the\n\ntrademark was granted to the partiesindividually in equal sharesas opposed to the\n\npartnership.",
        "The first defendant’s withdrawal from the partnership": "13. I had accepted the plaintiff’s version of the facts, that an\n\nagreement had been reached between the parties to transfer the first defendant’s\n\nshare of the partnership to him. The change in the status of the business from a\n\npartnership to a sole-proprietorship was evidenced in Registry Of Businesses searches upon\n\nGrand Am and also in a letter to IRAS dated 25 November 1999. This particular letter was\n\nsigned by both the plaintiff and the first defendant and made explicit reference to the\n\ntransfer of the business to the plaintiff as a going concern.14. In addition, I noted from the counterclaim that the first defendant\n\nwas also seeking the recovery of $91,614.70, which she alleged was the sum that the\n\nplaintiff had agreed to pay for her share of the partnership. There was an apparent\n\ncontradiction in her testimony. Assuming for the present application, that the first\n\ndefendant was indeed entitled to recover this amount of money for her share of the\n\npartnership upon dissolution, it did not then lie in her month to assert that there wasneverany agreement to transfer the partnership. I was of the view that this was clear evidence\n\nof a pre-existing agreement between the parties whereby all the assets and liabilities of\n\nthe partnership were to be transferred to the plaintiff upon the dissolution of the\n\npartnership. It was unclear whether or not this sum of money was eventually paid to the\n\nfirst defendant. The first defendant claimed that it was never paid. Conversely, this\n\npoint was neither admitted nor denied by the plaintiff in his pleadings save that he would\n\ncontest the point in the main trial. However I felt that this was probably irrelevant; in\n\nmy view whether or not the plaintiff had ‘cheated’ the first defendant of her\n\nshare of the partnership business did not in any way detract from the existence of such an\n\nagreement, but rather supported it.15. The credibility of the plaintiff’s evidence was further\n\nbolstered by the fact that there was ample evidence of the existence of the second part of\n\nthe bargain between the parties i.e. that the first defendant was to remain with Grand Am\n\nas an employee. In a supplier account form with Isetan, the second defendant described\n\nhimself and the first defendant as the employees of the plaintiff trading as Grand Am.\n\nThere were also numerous Forms IR8A (return of employee’s remuneration) filed by the\n\nfirst and second defendants from 1998 – 2000 and receipts of employer’s CPF\n\ncontributions detailing the first and second defendants as the employees of Grand Am from\n\nJanuary to April 2001. Lastly, in the statement of affairs filed by the first and second\n\ndefendants in their bankruptcies, both described themselves as the employees of the\n\nplaintiff trading as Grand Am. The first defendant had in her Official Assignee\n\nDeclaration, also stated unequivocally that she no longer had any assets in the business\n\nof Grand Am. Hence, all the cumulative evidence strongly suggested that there was such an\n\nagreement between the parties for the transfer of the first defendant’s share in the\n\npartnership to the plaintiff, pursuant to which she had divested her interest in the\n\npartnership prior to the bankruptcy order.16. Prior to the dissolution of a partnership, each of the partners\n\ni.e. the plaintiff and the first defendant has a proprietary interest in each and every\n\nasset. However the plaintiff has no entitlement to claim any particular item of property\n\nas his own in the absence of some contrary agreement (seeRodriguez v Speyer Brothers[1919] AC 59 andBurdett-Coutts v Inland Revenue Commissioner[1960] 1 WLR 1027).17. The position changes when the partnership is terminated. Upon a\n\ngeneral dissolution, each of the partners is entitled to receive that amount which, after\n\naccounting for the firm’s debts and liabilities, turn out to be due to them\n\nrespectively (see s 39 Partnership Act [Cap 391]). The position is similar with respect to\n\nthe trademark which is partnership property. I need only refer to Lindley & Banks on\n\nPartnership (17 ed) at para 3-20, it states:-If on a dissolution all the partners are equally entitled to the\n\n  goodwill of a firm, they cannot even by agreement, insist on a trade or service mark\n\n  belonging to a firm being registered in their respective names. If they cannot agree to\n\n  vest the trade or service mark in one or more of themselves (jointly if more than one), it\n\n  must be realised for the benefit of all the partners.18. On the facts of this case, upon the withdrawal of the first\n\ndefendant from the partnership on the 31 December 1997, the partnership was wound up and\n\nceased to exist. This was not due to the operation of s 33 of the Partnership Act which\n\nprovides that the bankruptcy of a partner ipso facto dissolves the firm, but rather was a\n\nresult of s 2 of the Act which made it impossible for a partnership to exist when there\n\nwas only one remaining partner left. The rights of the first defendant to an account hence\n\narose. Thereforeprima facie, the trademark forming part of the pool of partnership\n\nassets would have to be realised for the benefit of all the partners. However, there was\n\nalso in place at the same time, an agreement between the parties that the first defendant\n\nwould transfer her share in the partnership to the plaintiff’s sole-proprietorship in\n\nconsideration for the re-payment of $91,614.70 and the promise of continued employment\n\nwith Grand Am. This agreement would naturally include the rights over the trademark, that\n\nbeing partnership property. I was therefore of the view that, the ownership rights over\n\nthe McBlue trademark were also transferred to the plaintiff pursuant to the agreement. In\n\nother words, as from the date of dissolution of the partnership on 31 December 1997, the\n\nrights in the trademark became vested in the plaintiff.19. My conclusion was unaffected by the fact that the certificate of\n\nregistration was not rectified and continued to show the first defendant as a joint\n\nproprietor of the trademark; neither was there an assignment of the first defendant’s\n\nrights over the trademark to the plaintiff. However I thought that these omissions were\n\nprobably due to inadvertence as well as to the close familial relationship between both\n\nparties. Further, I also noted that the last time when the certificate was renewed was\n\nsometime in September 1994 when the parties were still in partnership and on amicable\n\nterms with each other. There was hence no cause for rectification of the certificate in\n\n1994. The parties also probably omitted to rectify the register when the partnership was\n\nsubsequently dissolved or thought that there was no such need to do so since the\n\nregistration would only be good till 2004. In any case, I thought that it was clear from\n\nthe facts that the parties intended for the first defendant to transfer her share in the\n\npartnership to the plaintiff.",
        "Infringement of trademark": "20. Having found as I did that the trademark was partnership property\n\nand that it had been transferred to the plaintiff (or the sole-proprietorship) upon the\n\ndissolution of the partnership in 1997, it remained for me to consider whether there had\n\nbeen an infringement of the trademark to justify the granting of the injunctions sought.21. Section 26 of the Act states that only the proprietor has the\n\nexclusive rights to use the trademark and to authorize other persons to use the trademark\n\nin relation to those goods or services for which the trademark is registered. Section 27\n\ngoes further to specify the acts amounting to infringement of a registered trademark. In\n\ngeneral, a person is said to have infringed another’s trademark when he uses the\n\ntrademark in the course of trade in relation to the goods or services for which the\n\ntrademark is registered or when he authorized other persons to do so without the consent\n\nof the proprietor. If I am correct in holding that the plaintiff was from 1998 onwards,\n\nthe sole-proprietor of the McBlue trademark, it seemed clear that the first defendant\n\n(together with the other defendants) had infringed his trademark by offering for sale\n\nunder the business of GA, goods and apparel bearing the McBlue trademark which are not of\n\nthe plaintiff’s manufacture or origin. The plaintiff was able to provide the court\n\nwith copies of invoices and other supporting documents for goods bearing the McBlue\n\ntrademark for the account of GA rather than Grand Am. There was also evidence that the\n\nfirst and second defendants had been corresponding with the suppliers of Grand Am but\n\nordering goods and apparel for GA’s account.22. Consequently, the defence of the first defendant (that she was\n\nentitled as a joint proprietor to authorise GA to purchase and deal with goods bearing the\n\nMcBlue trademark) must fail. Similarly, even if I accepted as true that the first and\n\nsecond defendants were employed on a free-lance basis by the plaintiff and could do\n\nwhatever they wished, this did not mean that they were entitled to use the trademark for\n\ntheir own benefit to the detriment of Grand Am when the first defendant no longer had any\n\ninterest in the trademark.",
        "Conclusion": "23. I was of the view that the plaintiff was entitled to protect his\n\ntrademark and prevent other persons from using or otherwise dealing in it. I therefore\n\nallowed the Order 14 application and granted the following orders:(a)    That the defendants whether acting by itself or themselves,\n\njointly or severally or by their servants, agents or anyone over whom they exert power or\n\ncontrol of any of them or otherwise howsoever be restrained from importing, exporting,\n\nordering, purchasing, offering for sale, selling, supplying, distributing, disposing of or\n\nparting with possession of or otherwise howsoever dealing in or with the McBlue trademark\n\nor any other products not of the plaintiff’s manufacture or origin bearing the McBlue\n\ntrademark or words visually or phonetically similar thereto; or otherwise howsoever\n\ninfringing the plaintiff’s registered Trade Mark No, 4380/87.(b)    That the defendants deliver up within 30 days all goods and\n\nmaterials which would offend the injunction granted under prayer (a) and the defendants to\n\nverify on oath such deliveries up, including goods or materials consigned to department\n\nstores and other outlets.(c) An order for discovery relating to orders (a) and (b).(d) An inquiry as to damages; notice of assessment to be filed by the\n\nplaintiff after discovery and within 14 days of the date of application, and(e) Costs to be taxed unless otherwise agreed.However, so as not to prejudice the defendants on their counterclaim, I\n\nalso ordered early trial dates for the same.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
