        "The issues": "20 The issues in the appeal were:a          Did the prosecution prove beyond a\n\n    reasonable doubt that the appellant was present at      the scene of\n\n    the second incident?b         If so, was the appellant\n\n    guilty of the offence of rioting?c         Whether the following\n\n    witnesses were credible:i        PW2 and PW5, against both of\n\n      whom impeachment exercises were conducted;ii       PW5 and S/Sgt Abdul Halim b Haji\n\n      Mohd (\"PW7\"), in relation to a statement   contained in the Full Incident\n\n      Report, allegedly made at 5.38 am on 7\n\n      March           1999;iii      PW1, PW2 and PW5inter se; andiv      the appellant and DW2inter se.d       Whether the judge should have drawn an\n\n    adverse inference under s 116 Illustration (g) of the  Evidence Act against the prosecution\n\n    for failing to call PW5s friend, to whom he claimed\n\n    to            have spoken on Madras\n\n    Street, before the first incident occurred.e       Whether the sentence imposed was\n\n    manifestly excessive.21 In dealing with this appeal, the court bore in mind certain well-established\n\nprinciples. Determinations by trial judges often involve an assessment of both the facts and the\n\nwitnesses demeanour. The relationship between objective evidence and the trial judges findings\n\non the veracity of a witness was set out inPP v Yeo Choon Poh[1994] 2 SLR 867:As was held by Spenser-Wilkinson J inTara Singh & Ors v PP[1949] MLJ 88at p 89, the principle is that an impression as to the demeanour of the witness ought not\n\n  to be adopted by a trial judge without testing it against the whole of his evidence.In the present case, the judge was careful to state, in relation to every\n\nwitness, that her conclusions were based on both objective evidence and the witness demeanour.22 What then, is the role of the appellate court in relation to the trial judges\n\nfindings based on fact and those based on demeanour? The starting point wasYap Giau Beng Terence\n\nv PP[1998] 3 SLR 656:It is trite law that an appellate court should be slow to overturn the trial\n\n  judges findings of fact,especially where they hinge on the trial judges assessment of\n\n  the credibility and veracity of witnesses, unless they can be shown to be plainly wrong or\n\n  against the weight of evidenceThen again, when it comes to inferences of facts to be drawn from the actual\n\n  findings  an appellate judge is as competent as any trial judge to draw any necessary\n\n  inferences of fact (emphasis added)23 It has however to be recognised that this dichotomy cannot be too strictly\n\napplied. The appellate court only sees the record of proceedings, which are words on a printed page.\n\nThe same words can be coloured differently by different types of demeanour. The result of the\n\ninteraction between the witness demeanour and his or her words cannot be overlooked. As I said inPP v Julia Elizabeth TubbsMA 42/2001:In the normal case, a judge sitting on appeal should be sensitive tothe\n\n  impressionistic nuances which invariably contribute to the inferences drawnby the trial\n\n  judge, who had the opportunity of observing and evaluating the evidence first-hand. (emphasis\n\n  added)The first issue: identification evidence24 The starting point wasHeng Aik Ren Thomas v PP[1998] 3 SLR 465, which\n\nadapted theTurnbullguidelines to the Singapore legal system. In dealing with identification\n\nevidence, the principles to be applied were:a               \n\n  Does the prosecutions case depend wholly or substantially on the correctness of the\n\n  identification    evidence?b               \n\n  If so, is the identification evidence of good quality, considering the circumstances in which\n\n  the           identification was made?c               \n\n  If the identification evidence is of poor quality, is there any other evidence which supports\n\n  the            correctness of the\n\n  identification?25 Under part (b) above, a non-exhaustive list of factors includes:a             \n\n  The length of time that the witness observed the accused: in this case, PW5 glanced at the\n\n  appellant for five to eight seconds each time.b             \n\n  The distance at which the observation was made: in this case, the appellant was never more than\n\n  seven metres away from PW5. PW5 could see the appellants entire body.c             \n\n  The number of times the witness had seen the accused: in this case, PW5 stole several glances at\n\n  the   appellant during the second incident.d             \n\n  Any special reasons for the witness to remember the accused: in this case, PW5 was put through\n\n  a     harrowing experience. As was pointed out inPP v L (a minor)[1999] 3 SLR 219, this was likely\n\n  to                 \n\n  carve the assailants image indelibly into the victims mind:It seemed to me that it wasprecisely the fact thatshe had been molested which would have\n\n  caused   [the witness] to take a really good look at her molester and commit his face to\n\n  her memory. (emphasis           added)e             \n\n  the length of time between the original observation and the identification to the police: in this\n\n  case, it was less than a month.26 Moreover, there was sufficient lighting at Sim Lim Tower for PW5 to see the\n\nappellant clearly. There were three fluorescent lights to PW5s right, and a light from the\n\ncarpark driveway above. Although there was blood in PW5s eyes, he was given some water to wash\n\nthe blood off his face. The judge found that, despite his fear, PW5 was lucid enough to reason\n\nthrough his chances of escape and to try to look at his assailants so that he could identify them if\n\nneed be.27 There was no reason to overturn the judges finding that the quality of the\n\nidentification evidence was good.The second issue: the offence of rioting28 The offence of rioting is defined in s 146 as:146. Whenever force or violence is used by an unlawful assembly or by any\n\n  member thereof, in prosecution of the common object of such assembly, every member of such\n\n  assembly is guilty of the offence of rioting.29 The first element of the offence is that the appellant was a member of an\n\nunlawful assembly. The meaning of \"unlawful assembly\" most relevant to this case was in s\n\n141(c):141. An assembly of 5 or more persons is designated an \"unlawful\n\n  assembly\", if the common object of the persons composing that assembly is(c) to commit any mischief or criminal trespass, or other offence30 The first requirement under this element is that the common object of the\n\nassembly was, for example, to commit an offence.Lim Thian Hor v PP[1996] 2 SLR 258drew a\n\ndistinction between \"common object\" and \"similar or same object\". For the\n\nformer, \"it is essential that the object should be common to the persons who constitute the\n\nassembly and they should be aware of it and concur in it.\" In the present case, there was no\n\ndoubt that the group of men knew of and concurred in the plan to cause hurt to PW5. They had\n\ngathered at Sim Lim Tower for that purpose. The common object, causing hurt to a person, obviously\n\nfell within the definition of an \"offence\".31 The second requirement under this element is that there must have been at\n\nleast five members of the assembly. A \"member of an unlawful assembly\" is also defined in\n\nthe statute:142. Whoever, being aware of facts which render any assembly an unlawful\n\n  assembly, intentionally joins that assembly, or continues in it, is said to be a member of an\n\n  unlawful assembly.This requirement was satisfied in the present case.32 The second element is that violence or force was used in carrying out the\n\ncommon object. This need only be used by any one or more members of the unlawful assembly. This\n\nelement was also present in the present case, as some of the men had slapped PW5. It was irrelevant\n\nfor issues of liability that the appellant did not use force against PW5.",
        "The third issue: the credibility of the witnesses": "33 As for point (i) in paragraph 20(c) above, only PW5s credibility was dealt\n\nwith in the appeal, as PW2s evidence did not extend to the second incident. Point (iii) was not\n\ndealt with, because that part of PW5s evidence which PW1 and PW2 corroborated also did not relate\n\nto the second incident.34 Point (i) will be discussed first. The key charge which could be levelled at\n\nPW5s credibility was that he had lied to the doctors at the hospital that he had sustained his\n\ninjuries from a fall. This should not greatly affect his credibility for two reasons:a         The judge found that he was\n\n  genuinely afraid of reprisals from his assailants, should the police come to   \n\n  know of the incident. This was not an irrational fear, for his assailants knew his address, and\n\n  that he had a           wife and young children.b         In any case, he told the\n\n  police the truth on the same day.35 Point (ii) was also related to PW5s credibility. The defence sought to show\n\nthat PW5s testimony was inconsistent with a statement he had made to PW7, which was reflected in\n\nthe Full Incident Report. The entry at 5.38 am stated:SIO Halim informed that according to SIO Rajan, earlier he had a drinking\n\n  session at the said pub and had a fall, resulting in some slight injuries on the forehead. No\n\n  dispute or fight took place. Anyway, SIO Rajan is safe and sound at home.Both PW5 and PW7 denied that PW5 had said that: one, he had been drinking at the\n\npub; and two, he was at home at 5.38 am. The judge reasoned that, if PW5 did not want the police to\n\nfind out about the assaults, he would have avoided mentioning the pub. The evidence also showed that\n\nPW5 had registered himself at the hospital at 5.03 am, and hence it was very unlikely that he was\n\nhome by 5.38 am. There was no reason to doubt such logic. As for PW5s lie about his sustaining\n\ninjuries from a fall, the discussion in paragraph 34 above applies.36 The Full Incident Report showed that PW7 was more involved in the case than he\n\nwould admit. Apparently he had instructed his officers to go to the pub when he heard that PW5 was\n\nmissing. These were unilateral actions on his part, and there was no evidence that PW5 knew about\n\nthem.37 As regards point (iv), the defence opined that insufficient weight was given\n\nto DW2s evidence. I think the judge was correct in not placing much weight on his evidence\n\nbecause:a          DW2 had been to the\n\n  same pub with the appellant on several occasions, and there was nothing special   about\n\n  that occasion. In fact, it was the appellant who informed DW2, after he was released from\n\n  the               police\n\n  station, that there had been an assault that night.b          DW2s evidence was\n\n  inconsistent with that of the appellant, PW1, PW2 and PW5. DW2 said that the   \n\n  scene outside the pub after closing time was calm, with people milling around. According to the\n\n  others,               there\n\n  was a rather agitated crowd outside the pub.The fourth issue: the prosecutions failure to call a witness38 Section 116 Illustration (g) of the Evidence Act provides:The court may presume(g) that evidence which could be and is not produced would if produced by\n\n    unfavourable to the person who withholds it.39 The general principle is that a presumption will only arise if it constitutes\n\na withholding of evidence from the accused or the court (Yeo Choon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217). In determining whether evidence has been withheld, the factors which should be considered\n\ninclude:a     How material was the evidence of the witness who\n\n    was not produced? (Chua Keem Long  \n\n    v          PP[1996] 1 SLR 510)b     Did the prosecution intend to hinder or hamper the\n\n    defence? (Chua Keem Long v PP)c     Was the witness absence from court brought about\n\n    by the inaction of the defence? (Tan Ah   Lay v PPCriminal Appeal 14/93,\n\n    Unreported)40 In the present case, PW5s friend was not a material witness, as his\n\nevidence would pertain only to matters even before the first incident. The prosecution could not be\n\nsaid to have hindered the defence because they made the defence aware of the existence of and role\n\nplayed by PW5s friend. Hence the defence could have called this witness, but chose not to.The fifth issue: sentencing41 The punishment prescribed for this offence is set out in s 147:147. Whoever is guilty of rioting shall be punished with imprisonment for a\n\n    term which may extend to 5 years and shall also be liable to caning.42 According toSentencing Practice in the Subordinate Courts, the\n\nsentencing range for non-secret society related cases is 18 to 24 months imprisonment. However,\n\nthere were many aggravating factors and relatively few mitigating ones. The former include:a       The second incident was premeditated.\n\n    Three of the assailants took PW5 to Sim Lim Tower, and must have informed the rest to join them\n\n    there.b       PW5 was subject to terror for an hour,\n\n    in a deserted location. There was both mental and     physical abuse.c       While PW5s injuries were due to the\n\n    first, not the second, assault, the members of the second unlawful assembly persisted despite\n\n    the fact that PW5 was already injured.d       The appellant had criminal records,\n\n    including a similar antecedent. He was sentenced to 18    months probation for\n\n    attempted theft in 1995, but breached probation by committing\n\n    an            offence of rioting. He was\n\n    sentenced to 18 months imprisonment and six strokes of the\n\n    cane         for that offence, and a further six months\n\n    imprisonment for breaching probation.43 The mitigating factors were those stated by the judge (see paragraph 18\n\nabove). These were far outweighed by the aggravating factors. I did not think the sentence imposed\n\nwas manifestly excessive.Motion to adduce fresh evidence: Criminal Motion 29 of 200144 On 14 September 2001, the appellant filed a notice of motion that the defence\n\nwould seek to admit fresh evidence at the hearing. One Kesavan s/o Seenivasan (\"Kesavan\"),\n\nwho was convicted of criminal intimidation and rioting in respect of the second incident, was\n\nwilling to testify that the appellant was not present at the scene.45 The High Courts power to receive additional evidence is found in s 257(1)\n\nof the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68):In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter the High Court, if it thinks\n\n    additional evidence is necessary, may either take such evidence itself or direct it to be taken\n\n    by a District Court or Magistrates Court.46 The principles which apply to the exercise of this power were enunciated inLadd\n\nv Marshall[1954] 3 All ER 745 and adopted inJumaat b Samad v PP[1993] SLR 338. The\n\ncourt would exercise its power only if:a     The evidence could not have been obtained with\n\n    reasonable diligence for use at the trial;b     The evidence is such that, if given, it would\n\n    probably have an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive;\n\n    andc     The evidence is credible.47 As for the first condition, it was true that Kesavan turned himself in to the\n\npolice only after the conclusion of the appellants trial. But it was the defences case that\n\nKesavan and the appellant were childhood friends, and were still acquainted at the time of the\n\nassaults. That being so, the appellant was in a better position than any other party in this case to\n\nobtain Kesevans evidence. However, the defence could not produce evidence of any attempts which\n\nthe appellant had made to contact Kesavan before the appellant was tried. I was of the opinion that\n\nthe evidence could have been obtained for use at the trial, had reasonable diligence been used.48 With regards to the second condition, it was difficult to see how Kesavans\n\nevidence could have an important influence on the result of the case. The crux of the judges\n\ndecision was based on PW5s identification evidence, which was found to be reliable. Kesavans\n\nevidence would not challenge that finding. Indeed, it is rather odd for the defence to attempt to\n\nprove that the appellant wasnotat Sim Lim Tower, rather than that hewassomewhere\n\nelse.49 The third hurdle, too, was not cleared. It was sufficient to refer toChung\n\nTuck Kwai v PP[1998] 2 SLR 693, which disposed of the matter:At this stage of appeal, the prosecution would not have the opportunity of\n\n    cross-examining [the witness] to determine his credibility.The additional evidence was of\n\n    such a nature that it ought not to be accepted as credible without [him] being put to\n\n    cross-examination. (emphasis added)Hence I dismissed the motion to adduce fresh evidence.Conclusion50 In view of the above, I dismissed the appeal.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
