        "Closing submissions": "18 Despite the stand taken by the accused, defence counsel made a brief\n\nclosing submission. His submission contained two main aspects – the first pertained\n\nto the analysis of the drugs by the DSS and the second concerned the issue whether the\n\ndrugs seized from the accused were meant for trafficking.19 In regard to the aspect concerning the analysis of drugs, defence\n\ncounsel invited the attention of the court that out of the eight DSS Lab Certificates (see\n\nexhs P-53, P-54, P-55, P-56, P-58, P-59, P-60 and P-60 at pages 35 to 38 and 40 to 43 of\n\nthe PI notes) only the first three ie, exhs P-53, P-54 and P-55 (pages 35 to 37 of the PI\n\nnotes) had the endorsement ‘confidence level of 99.9999%’, and the rest did not\n\nbear such an endorsement. He said that the absence of the said endorsement on the\n\nremaining certificates rendered them suspect and consequently the court should not act on\n\nthem.20 As regards the second issue whether the drugs seized were meant for\n\ntrafficking, counsel’s submission was as follows:1.2 Amount of drugs meant for trafficking1.2.1 It is the evidence of the Accused from his statements (P69 &\n\n    P71) which were admitted by the Prosecution, that he is a consumer of heroin and that he\n\n    consumes a substantial amount of heroin (about half a sachet a day). His addiction was\n\n    supported by the medical report of Dr Leow Kee Fong (D3/P48) that the Accused was treated\n\n    for drug withdrawal syndrome from 26 to 29 June 1999. Accused was not merely in Changi\n\n    Prison Hospital for observation. While there is no direct evidence that the Accused was\n\n    admitted to New Changi Hospital on 29 June 1999 as a result of drug withdrawal, it is\n\n    submitted that the probable cause would be due to drug withdrawal. It is the evidence of\n\n    Dr Lau Ching Ong (PW3) that the Morphine (a by-product of Diamorphine) level in\n\n    Accused’s urine is considered to be on the high side.1.2.2 It is also the evidence of the girlfriend of the Accused, Ivy\n\n    Cheng (PW14) that she consumed heroin at the said flat at Block 325 together with the\n\n    Accused. This evidence tally with the Accused evidence as contained in his statement (P69\n\n    and P70) that he gives heroin to PW14 to smoke free of charge.1.2.3 It is the evidence of the Accused from his statement (P71) that\n\n    he would consume the heroin from the big plastic bags after packing some heroin into\n\n    sachets for selling. Accordingly C1 (one packet) was meant for the Accused’s and\n\n    PW14’s joint consumption. The 19 sachets (C2a) packed separately in a ziplock bag C2\n\n    (P102) were meant for selling. However as stated by PW4, we are now unable to determine\n\n    the nett amount of Diamorphine in C1 as it was mixed together with C2a before analysis. It\n\n    is noted that drugs exhibits are normally pulverised and homogenised before analysis to\n\n    ensure consistency of the contents before samples are extracted. Accordingly there is no\n\n    consistency before pulverising and homogenising the drugs. It is submitted that no weight\n\n    should be given to the evidence of PW4 who attempted to repair the damage by saying that\n\n    C1 and C2a looks similar. Her evidence runs contrary to the need for scientific analysis\n\n    of drugs in drug offences. There is a big question mark as to the amount of Diamorphine in\n\n    C1 and C2a which could not be answered by simple calculations based on the fraction of\n\n    their relative gross weight to each other.1.2.4 Similarly, it is further submitted that part of the heroin in BB\n\n    (P74) was also for the joint consumption of the Accused and PW14.1.3 In view of the above, it is the humble submission of the Defence\n\n  that the presumption of trafficking had been rebutted on some of the drugs and that there\n\n  is a real doubt as to the exact weight of the drugs which was meant and intended for\n\n  trafficking.21 The remainder of his submission was as follows:2. Other inconsistencies in the Prosecution’s Case2.1 Collection of drugs2.1.1 It is Cpl Cynthia Lim’s (PW7), Cpl Uma’s (PW12) and Cpl\n\n    Jory Lim’s (PW9) evidence that from 4.25 pm to 5.55 pm on 26 June 1999, the Accused\n\n    only came downstairs from his flat at Block 325 on two occasions i.e. once at 4.35 pm when\n\n    he turned around and went upstairs again and another time at about 5.55 pm when he was\n\n    arrested. On the other hand it is also the Prosecution’s case through the\n\n    Accused’s statements that the Accused had collected the drugs that was allegedly\n\n    meant for trafficking from one Malaysian at the carpark next to Block 325 on that material\n\n    day at about 4.45pm.3. Adverse inference3.1 It is submitted that no adverse inference should be drawn against\n\n  the Accused for his decision to remain silent as the Accused had by admitting the contents\n\n  and voluntariness of his statement adopted the contents of the said statements as his\n\n  evidence before the court.4. Conclusion4.1 In view of the above, it is the submission of the Defence that it\n\n  is unsafe to convict the Accused on the charge (A1) based on the evidence before the\n\n  court.Conclusion22 Although the accused elected not to contest the charge and despite\n\nhis decision to remain silent at the close of the prosecution case, I reviewed all the\n\nevidence adduced at the trial and considered all the submissions made, as was obligatory\n\nof me.23 There was undisputed evidence that at the time the accused was\n\napprehended, he was found in possession of two large packets of drugs housed in aMilotin and another six sachets of drugs in his waist bag. Subsequent search of his flat\n\nyielded not only drugs but also a large quantity of empty sachets, a weighing scale and a\n\nsealing equipment – all implements of drug trafficking. The diamorphine content of\n\nthe drugs in theMilotin as well as the six sachets was certified to be not less\n\nthan 15.56g (exhs P-53 and P-61). The drugs seized from his rented apartment included two\n\nlarge packets of drugs (exh P-54). They were found to contain not less than 14.55g of\n\ndiamorphine and the remainder constituted the balance ie, 7.89g of diamorphine (see exh\n\nP-55, P-56, P-58, P-59 and P-60). The total gross weight of the drugs seized amounted to\n\n2,477.88g (946.12g found on him and 1,531.76g in his flat). Such a large quantity of drugs\n\ntaken together with the paraphernalia mentioned earlier warranted the inference that all\n\nof them could not be for his own consumption and was intended for sale and distribution to\n\nothers.24 The court was indeed conscious that he was a drug addict and that\n\nhis urine contained a high dose of morphine and codeine. Though Dr Leow’s certificate\n\ndid not adequately explain his condition, the court concluded, having regard to the\n\ncertificate issued by Dr Yap of Alexandra Hospital, that he was indeed a hardcore addict.\n\nHowever, an addict could still traffic in the drugs which he was found to be in possession\n\nof. True, he might well use part of the drugs in his possession for his own consumption.\n\nIn the present case, even if I were to disregard those amounts found in the sachets (see\n\nexhs P-55, P-56, P-58, P-59, P-60 and P-61) the diamorphine content of the four large\n\npackets (exhs P-53 and P-54) still amounted to 29.44g. The two DSS certificates pertaining\n\nto those exhibits P-53 and P-54 also included the endorsement of ‘confidence\n\nlevel’. In the circumstances any allowance for his personal consumption was\n\nprofitless and any amendment to the charge would only be cosmetic. Furthermore, the\n\nstatements admitted in evidence clearly indicated that the accused was going to traffic in\n\nthe drugs found in the large packets.25 Let me now deal with the criticism of counsel concerning the drug\n\nanalysis and absence of the endorsement ‘confidence level’ in some of the\n\ncertificates.26 In my view, the criticism of counsel seemed to ignore the\n\nexplanation given by the DSS expert, Dr Angeline Yap who said that the protocol employed\n\nby the DSS was that whenever they had to carry out tests on smaller exhibits it would not\n\nbe feasible for them to take more than six samples and in such cases, the said endorsement\n\nwould not be included. She added that the quantity found in exhibits P-56, P-58, P-59,\n\nP-60 and P-61 (pages 38, 40, 41, 42 and 43 of the PI notes) were not sizeable to take more\n\nthan six samples; nonetheless the absence of the endorsement did not make their analyses\n\nor conclusions any less certain.27 The court having reviewed all the evidence, accepted the evidence of\n\nDr Angeline Yap on the diamorphine content as being valid. At any rate, even if the court\n\nwere to act only on two of the three DSS Certificates which had the endorsement\n\n‘confidence level’ (exhs P-53 and P55 – pages 35 and 36 of the PI notes),\n\nthe amount of diamorphine certified therein amounted to 29.44g, (14.89 + 14.55) a great\n\ndeal more than the critical 15g level. In the result, I found the arguments by counsel on\n\nthis aspect to be of little merit.28 Upon review of all the evidence, I was satisfied that the\n\nprosecution had indeed discharged its ultimate burden in proving its case against the\n\naccused beyond a reasonable doubt. In my finding, the presumptive provisions of s 17 of\n\nthe MDA had not been rebutted. In the circumstances, the prosecution’s submission to\n\ndraw an adverse inference against the accused pursuant to s 196(2) of the CPC because of\n\nhis election to remain silent was purely superfluous since the accused had at the outset\n\ncategorically maintained that he did not propose to contest the charge against him.29 In the premises, based on all the evidence, I found the accused\n\nguilty as charged. He was convicted accordingly and was sentenced to the only punishment\n\nprescribed under the law. The other charges stood down pending the outcome of the trial\n\nwere withdrawn by the prosecution and pursuant to s 177 of the CPC the accused was given a\n\ndischarge amounting to an acquittal in respect of those charges.Dated this 8thday of February 2000.MPH RUBINJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
