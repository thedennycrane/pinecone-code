        "Dependency Claim": "24 On the Dependency Claim, the plaintiff claimed that the losses for the four years lost due to Dr Tan’s negligence amounted to $1,154,057.01. Counsel for the defendants disputed the sum of $1,154,057.01 claimed on multiple bases. I will first address the only argument I accepted, before addressing the other arguments put forth by counsel for the defendants. 25 The dispute between counsel turned on whether the Dependency Claim should be calculated using the traditional method (where the total value of benefits received by the dependants from the deceased is computed) or the percentage deduction method (where a percentage from the deceased’s net salary is deducted, to account for the deceased’s personal expenditure. The law establishes that where there are two children, as in the present case, the percentage which represents the deceased’s personal expenditure would amount to 33.33%, leaving 33.33% for the deceased’s spouse, and 20.83% for each child). Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that the traditional method should be used. Counsel for the plaintiff thus computed the value of the benefits received by Peter Traynor’s dependants from him. For his two daughters, this comprised school fees, mathematics coaching, and their portion of the annual expenses of the Traynor family. For his wife, this comprised household maintenance and her portion of the annual expenses of the Traynor family. Counsel for the plaintiff ran into difficulties when calculating the respective portions of the annual expenses, and conceded that an exact apportionment of the expenses between the members of the Traynor family was unavailable. Counsel for the plaintiff thus relied upon the conventional percentage laid down in the precedents: 20.83% for each of the daughters, and 33.33% for the wife. 26 Counsel for the defendants submitted that counsel for the plaintiff’s use of the conventional percentage for the traditional method was improper, and that the percentage deduction method should be used instead. Counsel for the 2nd defendant referred me to the case ofSulastribte Achmad v Tan Hee Hang and another[2017] SGHC 7 where the court stated that “[w]here the traditional method of assessment is employed, the claimant must prove the value of the benefits received by him or her from the deceased”. I thus find that the plaintiff has not discharged her burden in showing that the daughters and the wife benefited in the proportions of 20.83% and 33.33%, respectively, of the Traynor family’s annual expenses. The benefits relating to the proportions of the Traynor family’s annual expenses must thus be removed from the plaintiff’s quantification of the Dependency Claim. This gives rise to a sum of $346,677. 27 For completeness, I shall briefly address the reason why I did not adopt the percentage deduction method put forth by the defendants. Mr Kronenburg, Mr Lek, and Ms Kang have referred me to the case ofHanson Ingrid Christina and others v TanPuey Tze and another appeal[2008] 1 SLR(R) 409, which stated that “[t]he percentage deduction method is, however, not suitable in all cases… it is a good guide when a stable pattern has been established in a marriage and virtually all net earnings are spent on living expenses”. Not all of Peter Traynor’s net earnings were spent on living expenses. Even on the defendants’ case, Peter Traynor’s income amounted to $308,386 per annum, far from the living expenses of $243,000 per annum submitted by counsel for the plaintiff (and which I accepted, see [37]). 28 I now turn to the arguments of counsel for the defendants, which are rejected or which have become irrelevant. Counsel for the 1st defendant disputed the amount claimed for the Dependency Claim on the following bases. First, that the plaintiff’s quantification of the Traynor family’s annual expenses for the purposes of the Dependency Claim wrongly utilised Peter Traynor’s expenses for the Loss of Inheritance Claim. In particular, counsel for the 1st defendant argued that Peter Traynor’s expenses for the Loss of Inheritance Claim were his own personal expenses, and not the expenses of the Traynor family as a whole. Second, that there was insufficient explanation given for how the plaintiff’s expert, Mr Abuthahir Abdul Gafoor, determined which transactions were investments and thus not included in computing the Traynor family’s annual expenses. Third, that the plaintiff’s quantification of $3,500 per annum for mathematics coaching provided by Peter Traynor to each of his two daughters was excessive. 29 Counsel for the 2nd defendant disputed the amount claimed on the Dependency Claim following bases. First, that the plaintiff double counted certain benefits such as school supplies and school bus services – they were included when calculating both the education fees of Peter Traynor’s daughters, and in the Traynor family’s annual expenses. Second, that a discount rate should be applied to certain benefits such as school supplies and school bus services as they are of a recurring nature. Third, that the amount claimed for mathematics coaching from Peter Traynor is unsubstantiated and overly enriching since Peter Traynor’s daughters were already attending mathematics tuition. Fourth, similar to counsel for the 1st defendant’s first argument, that the plaintiff’s quantification of the Traynor family’s annual expenses for the purposes of the Dependency Claim wrongly utilised Peter Traynor’s personal expenses. 30 I do not accept counsel for the 1st defendant’s first argument. In order to compute Peter Traynor’s savings for the purposes of the Loss of Inheritance Claim, one would have to subtract Peter Traynor’s total expenses from his income, and not merely his own personal expenses. I further find that this was indeed what Mr Gafoor did. For example, Mr Gafoor’s report stated that he excluded payments for school fees for Peter Traynor’s two daughters, as they were included separately in other expense calculations. If Mr Gafoor was only computing Peter Traynor’s personal expenses, there would be no reason to consider the school fees in the first place. I also do not accept counsel for the 1st defendant’s second argument. Mr Gafoor’s report states which transactions were investments, and the nature of such investments. Counsel for the 1st defendant has not given me reason to suspect that the details stated in Mr Gafoor’s report are false. I further reject counsel for the 1st defendant’s third argument. The plaintiff has adduced evidence showing that the maths tuition attended by Peter Traynor’s daughters (on top of the mathematics coaching provided by Peter Traynor) came up to about $60 per hour. Assuming Peter Traynor’s coaching was similarly worth $60 per hour, the $3,500 claimed by the plaintiff would come up to about an hour of coaching per week. I do not find this excessive, especially since Peter Traynor’s daughters attended math tuition classes only about three times a month, on average. 31 Counsel for the 2nd defendant’s first and second arguments are no longer relevant in light of my findings, as stated above in [26] and [22], respectively. I do not accept counsel for the 2nd defendant’s third and fourth argument, for the same reasons I do not accept counsel for the 1st defendant’s first and third argument (see [30]).",
        "Loss of Inheritance Claim": "32 On the Loss of Inheritance Claim, the plaintiff claimed that the losses for the four years lost due to Dr Tan’s negligence amounted to $894,657. In light of my finding at [19], the only relevant disputes concerned the quantification of Peter Traynor’s annual employment income, annual income increment, and his annual expenditure. 33 The plaintiff claimed that Peter Traynor’s annual employment income was $450,000. Counsel for the plaintiff derived this figure using Peter Traynor’s employment income in 2011, as Peter Traynor’s income in 2012 and 2013 would not be reliable since his work performance would have been impeded by his medical condition. The sum of $450,000 included an estimated bonus of five months’ salary, commission and car allowance. The quantifications of the latter two were taken from Peter Traynor’s income tax form for the year of 2013. 34 The defendants claimed that Peter Traynor’s annual employment income (after tax) was $308,386. Counsel for the defendants derived this figure using Peter Traynor’s employment income in 2012 and 2013. The sum of $308,386 included an estimated bonus of 1.1 months’ salary, which was the bonus Peter Traynor received in 2013. 35 I accept the figure of $450,000 given by counsel for the plaintiff. I agree that Peter Traynor’s income in 2012 and 2013 would not be reliable in light of his medical condition at that time. In particular, I accept the plaintiff’s evidence that Peter Traynor’s income was based on his work performance, which was severely affected by his medical condition at the time. 36 The plaintiff claimed that Peter Traynor’s annual salary increment would be 5%. This was derived using his previous annual increments, which ranged from 3.5% to 87.4%. The defendants did not factor any salary increases as they were of the opinion that there was no evidence that Peter Traynor’s salary increment would have outweighed inflation. I find that the evidence of Peter Traynor’s previous annual increments leads to the reasonable conclusion that his annual salary increment would be about 5%. 37 The plaintiff claimed that the Traynor family’s annual expenses amounted to $243,000. This was derived from the average expenses of the Traynor family from 2011 to 2013, with adjustments for investments, and for items such as Peter Traynor’s medical expenses. The defendants’ calculations assumed that the Traynor family’s annual expenses would have amounted to Peter Traynor’s earnings, thus leaving them with no savings. I note that the defendants’ assumption appears to be a result of calculating the Dependency Claim and the Loss of Inheritance Claim collectively. As stated above, see [23], I do not accept that the Dependency Claim and the Loss of Inheritance Claim should be calculated together. Counsel for the 1st defendant further relied on the fact that the Traynor family did not amass any savings in 2012 and 2013 to justify the assumption. However, as counsel for the plaintiff pointed out, 2012 and 2013 were exceptional years as the Traynor family purchased a house and Peter Traynor was undergoing medical treatment. Even if, as submitted by counsel for the 1st defendant, Peter Traynor’s insurance covered his medical expenses, this does not address the fact that the Traynor family purchased a house, and that Peter Traynor’s employment income was substantially reduced due to his medical condition. 38 I thus accept the plaintiff’s Loss of Inheritance Claim of $894,657.",
        "Loss of Appreciation Claim": "39 The plaintiff claimed $1.5m as loss of appreciation in value of the Traynor family’s home. This claim was made on the assumption that if not for Dr Tan’s negligence, Peter Traynor would have lived until he was 82, which I do not accept (see [19]). I thus reject the claim of $1.5m.",
        "Claims by Peter Traynor’s Estate": "40 The plaintiff claimed $681,399.53 as medical expenses, funeral, expenses, out of pocket expenses, grant of probate, bereavement, and pain and suffering. This claim was also made on the assumption that if not for Dr Tan’s negligence, Peter Traynor would have lived until he was 82, which I do not accept (see [19]). I thus reject the claim of $681,399.53. 41 In conclusion, I award the plaintiff $1,241,334 in damages. This sum comprises: (a) $346,677 for the Dependency Claim; and (b) $894,657 for the Loss of Inheritance Claim. I will hear submissions on costs at a later date. - Sgd -Choo Han TeckJudge Edmund Kronenburg (instructed), Benavon Lee (instructed) and Christopher Goh Seng Leong (Goh Phai Cheng LLC) for the plaintiff;Lek Siang Pheng, Mar Seow Hwei and Priscilla Wee Jia Ling (Dentons Rodyk & Davidson LLP) for the first defendant;Kang Yixian, Emily Su Xianhui and Sarah Nair (Donaldson & Burkinshaw LLP) for the second defendant"
