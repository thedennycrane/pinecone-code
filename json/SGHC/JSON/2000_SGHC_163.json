        "Background": "2 The plaintiff resides overseas and\n\nvisits Singapore two or three times a year. She is paid by the 4thdefendant\n\nthe monthly maintenance of $2,000.00. The 1stdefendant is the mother of the 2nd,\n\n3rdand 4thdefendants. The late Lee Poo Lai was her husband and\n\nfather of the other defendants. Mr Lee Poo Lai passed away in January 1999. In 1983 the\n\nplaintiff married the 4thdefendant. They have 2 children. In 1987 the late Mr\n\nLee Poo Lai and the defendants purchased the property as joint tenants. It became the home\n\nof the extended family. At that time, the 2ndand 3rddefendants\n\nwere students. In 1992, the 4thdefendant to the knowledge of the plaintiff\n\ntransferred without any consideration his interest under the joint tenancy to the other\n\ndefendants.3 In 1995 the 4thdefendant\n\nfiled Divorce Petition No. 2385 of 1995. In 1996, the Decree Nisi was granted on the\n\nplaintiff’s cross-petition. On 31 January 1997 the High Court made an order pursuant\n\nto section 106 of the Women’s Charter. It stated: \"The Respondent be given 40%\n\nof the one-fifth share of the petitioner in the property known as 23 Margoliouth Road,\n\nSingapore, that is, the sum of $760,000. The 4thdefendant appealed against the\n\nancillary orders which included the order for division of matrimonial property.4 The High Court delivered the following\n\nGrounds of Decision on 31 January 1997:\"(a) Matrimonial property:Order that the respondent is entitled to a\n\n  share in the one-fifth share of the petitioner in No. 23 Margoliouth Road. This is for the\n\n  reason that I do not accept the argument of the petitioner that his one-fifth share was a\n\n  gift to him by his parents.There is overwhelming evidence that from\n\n  1981 when the petitioner started working in the family business, he became, over the\n\n  years, the main person responsible for running the family business.Further after his marriage to the\n\n  respondent in 1983 and after the parties went to live in Margoliouth property, he made it\n\n  known to the respondent that this was their matrimonial home; notwithstanding that the\n\n  Margoliouth property was also the home of his parents and his two brothers.Therefore, I find that the respondent must\n\n  have share in the one-fifth share of the petitioner.On the evidence, I rule that the\n\n  respondent be given 40% of the one-fifth share, i.e. the sum of $760,000.\"5 The Court of Appeal reduced the\n\nmaintenance payable to the plaintiff but dismissed his appeal against the order made under\n\nsection 106 of the Women’s Charter. However, the Court of Appeal allowed him to pay\n\nthe sum of $760,000.00 by 2 instalments. On 26 September 1997 the Court of Appeal ordered:\n\n\"The Petitioner/Appellant do forthwith pay to the Respondent one half of $760,000 and\n\nthe other half before the end of this year.\" All other orders of the High Court were\n\nordered to remain.6 The plaintiff was not paid. By an\n\nex-parte application the plaintiff obtained and registered a Writ of Seizure and Sale\n\nagainst the property. Upon being notified the 1stto 3rddefendants\n\nfiled Originating Summons No. 841 of 1999 and they sought a declaration that the plaintiff\n\nhad no claim to or interest in the property and that the Order of Court Instrument No.\n\nI/51462M (Writ of Seizure and Sale) registered by the plaintiff against the property be\n\nremoved. Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) heard the application.7 By his Order made on 23 July 1999 Chao\n\nHick Tin J declared \"that on the basis of the order of the High Court dated 31stJanuary 1997 in Divorce Petition No. 2385 of 1995 and the judgment of the Court of Appeal\n\nin Civil Appeal No 30 of 1997 dated 26thSeptember 1997, the defendant (i.e.\n\nthe plaintiff in these proceedings) has no claim or interest in the property known as Lot\n\n1112 TS 25 together with the house erected thereon known as No. 23 Margoliouth Rod,\n\nSingapore …which is registered in the name of the plaintiffs (i.e. the 1stto 3rddefendants in these proceeds).\" [The brackets and the words within\n\nthem are added]. It was consequentially ordered that the application for registration of\n\nthe Order of Court Instrument I/51462M registered by the defendant against the property be\n\ncancelled or removed from the land register and that the Registrar of Titles be directed\n\nto register the Order made herein against the property. The plaintiff did not appeal\n\nagainst those orders.",
        "Plaintiff’s Contentions": "8 The contentions of the plaintiff’s counsel in his\n\nsubmissions may be summarised as follows. It was asserted on her behalf that the first\n\nthree defendants, though legal owners of the property as respects all shares in it, hold\n\nit in equity upon resulting or constructive trusts for the 4thdefendant. The\n\ntwo types of trusts, particularly their distinction, was succinctly discussed and applied\n\nto the facts in Cheong Yoke Kuen & Ors v Cheong Kwok Kiong[1999] 2 SLR 476. Para 17\n\nof the judgment the Court of Appeal referred to the case of Tan Poh Soon v Phua Sin Yin[1995] 3 SLR 201and pointed out the difference between the two trusts in these terms:\n\n\"The nature of a constructive trust is such that it could not be said to be\n\n‘created’ by the parties. It is a trust which isimposedby equity in\n\nrespect of an interest in a property in a variety of circumstances and which would render\n\nit inequitable for the owner of the property or any interest therein to hold it for his\n\nbenefit. It arises independently of the intention of the parties. A resulting trust,\n\nhowever, is different. It arises from a certain transaction carried out intentionally by\n\nthe parties concerned and the court infers an intention to create a trust in favour of a\n\nparty. The nature of this trust is summarised succinctly in Parker and MellowsThe\n\nModern Law of Trusts91998, 7thEd) at p 36: Implied or resulting trusts\n\narise where a settlor or testatorcarries out some intentional actother than the\n\ncreation of a relationship of trustee and beneficiary from which the court infers a\n\nrelationship of trustee and beneficiary. They consequently arise from theunexpressed\n\nbut presumed intentionof the settlor or testator.[Emphasis added].\"",
        "My Reasons": "9 The ground relied upon as giving rise to either of these\n\ntypes of trust was the fact that the 4thdefendant had transferred his interest\n\nas joint tenant without any consideration. It was then submitted, without further\n\nelaboration, that the 4thdefendant therefore held an \"equitable\"\n\ninterest in the property to the extent of his 1/5thshare.10 In my view the correct analysis was that a resulting\n\ntrust arose in favour of the 4thdefendant upon his transfer of his interest\n\nunder the joint tenancy without consideration to the 1stto 3rddefendants who held his equitable interest upon trust for him. Here, equity raised a\n\npresumption that the 4thdefendant did not intend to make a gift of his\n\ninterest to the 1stto 3rddefendants. It was asserted and therefore\n\nmust be accepted by the 1stto 3rddefendants and the 4thdefendant that the so-called consideration of $600,000.00, which was stated in the\n\nTransfer signed by the 4thdefendant in favour of the 1stto 3rddefendants, was purely for the purpose of ascertaining the stamp duty. I thought equity in\n\nthis case, as was usually the case, did not presume that the 4thdefendant had\n\nintended to make a gift to the 1stto the 3rddefendants. At the\n\nbottom of it, this was simply an evidential rule. The burden of proving that the transfer\n\namounted to a gift rested with and was upon the 4thdefendant. On the evidence\n\nbefore me, the 4thdefendant did not adduce any evidence to discharge that\n\nburden of proof. All that the plaintiff had to do was to make this analysis and tender\n\nthis submission before the Court of Appeal in the said appeal or before Chao Hick Tin J\n\n(as he then was) and ask for an order that they (the 1stto 3rddefendants) as trustees under the resulting trust sell the property and pay over 40% of\n\nthe net proceeds, as ordered by the courts in respect of the division of property. These\n\nconclusions would have followed in these proceedings but the defendants submitted that the\n\nplaintiff was precluded from relying on these submissions as they were considered or\n\ncanvassed or should have been canvassed before the High Court in the matrimonial\n\nproceedings, the Court of Appeal or before Chao Hick Tin J.11 On the material before me, I did not think that there\n\nwere circumstances to impose a constructive trust on the 1stto 3rddefendants based on either their refusal to recognise the interest of the 4thdefendant, who was not asserting that against them. The plaintiff herself did not have any\n\nproprietary claim against the 1stto 3rddefendants in respect of\n\nthe 4thdefendant’s 1/5 equitable interest in the property.12 Could she assert any secondary\n\nliability against the 1stto 3rddefendants on the two bases, namely\n\nrecipient liability or accessory liability, as explained by the Privy Council inRoyal\n\nBrunei Airlines Sdn Berhad v Tan(1995) 3 All ER 97? In Royal Brunei Airlines, the\n\nairline appointed a travel company to act as its ticketing agents. The agents were under\n\nthe agreement constituted trustees of the moneys received as airfares. The travel company\n\ndid not keep a separate trust account. All the airfares were paid into a current account\n\nwithout differentiation and the defendant, Tan, as the managing director authorised their\n\nuse in the ordinary course of business. The travel company was in breach of the trust. It\n\nbecame insolvent. The Privy Council held that Tan had dishonestly assisted the company in\n\nits breach of the trust and had committed the equitable wrong against the airline. Lord\n\nNicholls of Birkenhead succinctly highlighted the two bases of secondary liability at p\n\n386: \"Different considerations apply for the two heads of liability. Recipient\n\nliability is restitution-based; accessory liability is not.\" In the former case,\n\nthere would be a reversal of the unjust enrichment; in the latter case, the dishonest\n\naccessory would be made to account or make good any deficiency in the trust property.The\n\nRoyal Brunei Airlinescase is an illustration of the latter cause of action and the\n\nremedy at work. Another example of the latter personal liability for an equitable wrong isAgip (Africa) Ltd v Jackson[1990] Ch 265, [1991] Ch 547.13 I turn to the facts in this case. Were\n\nthe 1stto 3rddefendants recipients of trust property or property\n\nsimpliciter of the 4thdefendant where there had been a breach of trust or\n\nbreach of fiduciary duty. The answer was to my mind in the negative. The fact of the\n\nmatter was that the transfer had taken place in 1992, well ahead of the divorce petition,\n\nand there was nothing to suggest that the transfer was for the purpose of putting the\n\nproperty beyond the reach of the plaintiff. On the scant and slender evidence led, there\n\nseemed no room for the imposition of a constructive trust. On the bare facts as adduced,\n\nthere arose a resulting trust binding on the 1stto the 3rddefendant in favour of the 4thdefendant. Conceptually, it accorded with\n\northodox analysis. There was no question of any receipt of trust property. A resulting\n\ntrust arose. But alas, as would be apparent later, this did not avail the plaintiff.14 Frankly, the matter was not looked into\n\nand was not pursued with any degree of conviction or seriousness of purpose. Who could\n\nguess what could have turned up in a more rigorous investigation including a cross\n\nexamination sought before Chao Hick Tin J (as he then was) instead of following the\n\nnon-contentious mode of proceedings in the form of the originating summons as in this\n\ncase? Indeed, but for the evidential presumption in equity against a gift, a resulting\n\ntrust might not and could not have been found.15 Were the 1stto 3rddefendants liable as dishonest accessories? There was no evidence led of any assistance,\n\nlet alone any dishonesty in any assistance. They must be taken to have accepted the\n\ngratuitous transfer on the basis that a resulting trust would arise. That must be taken as\n\nthe basis upon which the 4thdefendant had proceeded.16 I now turn to the other submissions\n\nmade on behalf of the defendants. I did not think that the doctrines of res judicata or\n\nissue estoppel applied to the matrimonial proceedings or before the Court of Appeal on the\n\nsimple ground that the 1stand 3rddefendants were not before those\n\ncourts. However, I came to the conclusion that the doctrine of issue estoppel,\n\nunfortunately, operated against the plaintiff because the same issues had arisen or,\n\nunarguably, might have arisen in the proceedings before Chao Hick Tin J.17 InSeah Peng Song v Seah Peng Koon[unreported decision dated 4 September 1990 of Chan Sek Keong J (as he then was)] he said:\"Issue estoppel may arise when a\n\n  particular issue forming a necessary ingredient in a cause of action has been litigated\n\n  and decided and in subsequent proceedings between the same parties involving a different\n\n  cause of action to which the same issue is relevant one of the parties seeks to reopen\n\n  that issue.\"18 The Order made by Chao Hick Tin J\n\nstated that it was made on the basis of the decision of the High Court and the Court of\n\nAppeal. If that be the correct interpretation, and that therefore the learned Judge made\n\nno pronouncement about the interest of the 4thdefendant under the doctrine of\n\nresulting trust, it was clear that that particular point was raised and, in any case, it\n\nwas clear that that particular point might have been raised but was not raised.19 InArnold and Others v National\n\nWestminster Bank plc[1991] 3 All ER 41, Lord Keith said at p 47:\"Issue estoppel, too, has been\n\n  extended to cover not only the case where a particular point has been raised and\n\n  specifically determined in the earlier proceedings, but also that where in the subsequent\n\n  proceedings it is sought to raise a point which might have been but was not raised in the\n\n  earlier.\"20 I turn to the application to charge the\n\nCPF account of the 4thdefendant. The 4thdefendant’s responses\n\nwere these. He said he would have agreed if the plaintiff had written to him. Secondly, he\n\noffered to the plaintiff all his CPF monies in his Ordinary Account (less the maximum sum\n\nto be retained), which was estimated to be about $250,000.00, in full and final settlement\n\nof the judgment by having the same charged in her favour. The plaintiff was not correct in\n\nsuggesting that the 4thdefendant would give her the \"walk around\".\n\nShe ought to obtain a consensual charging order.21 For these reasons I made the orders I\n\ndid.Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
