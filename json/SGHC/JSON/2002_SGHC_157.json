        "The facts": "2    The facts were not largely in dispute. According to the\n\nstatement of agreed facts, Chng was scheduled to attend Court 13N for mentions on 14\n\nAugust 2000 in respect of a Housing Development Board (‘HDB’) parking summons\n\n(HDBCP: 078751/2000). A warrant of arrest was issued against him when he failed to attend\n\ncourt on the appointed day.3    On 12 October 2000, Chng, accompanied by his bailor\n\nShirley Wong, surrendered himself to the Warrant Enforcement Unit (‘WEU’). He\n\nwas attended to by Sergeant Loh Lai Chiang who administered a written warning to Chng in\n\npursuance of s 42A of the Road Traffic Act. Both Chng and Sergeant Loh signed the s 42A\n\nwarning. As Sergeant Loh served an average of ten to twenty s 42A warnings each day, he\n\nwas unable to recall how he had administered the warning to Chng. Nevertheless Sergeant\n\nLoh was adamant that he had followed the procedures of the WEU. The gist of the procedure\n\nentailed showing accused persons the s 42A warning, informing them to read it, reading and\n\nthen explaining the warning to them before specifically cautioning them that their driving\n\nlicenceswould bedisqualified if they failed to attend court. Chng denied that the\n\nwarning had been administered to him in the manner described above. According to Chng, he\n\nwas simply told by Sergeant Loh to read the s 42A warning and then to sign it. No\n\nexplanations were proffered and he was never specifically informed of the possibility\n\nthat, if he failed to attend court for the second time, he would be disqualified and his\n\nlicence suspended.4    Shirley Wong testified that on 12 October 2000, a\n\nwhite piece of paper was given to Chng to read. She said that Sergeant Loh did not say\n\nanything, only motioning for Chng to read through the paper and to sign it. She did not\n\nknow what this piece of paper was as she could not see or notice what Chng was signing.\n\nShe admitted that she was disinterested in the proceedings, as she was then preoccupied\n\nwith her own thoughts about work.5    Chng was informed on 13 November 2000 at Court 13N\n\nthat he had to attend court again on 11 December 2000. He failed to do so and the\n\nprosecution applied to the court for an order disqualifying him from driving, pursuant to\n\ns 42A of the Act. The application was granted and, consequently, Chng was disqualified\n\nfrom driving with effect from 11 December 2000 until such time as the case HDBCP\n\n078751/2000 was resolved. A second warrant of arrest was also issued against him. Chng was\n\nnot expressly notified by the WEU of the order of disqualification that was made against\n\nhim.6    On 12 December 2000 Chng submitted written\n\nrepresentations to the Subordinate Courts citing work commitments for his failure to\n\nattend court on 11 December 2000. On 3 January 2001, the court rejected his\n\nrepresentations and directed that the second warrant of arrest was to stand. On 30\n\nDecember 2000 at about 1.15 a.m., Chng was involved in a traffic accident. The motor car\n\nwhich he was driving had veered out of control and mounted a curb before colliding into an\n\nelectrical box and the sheltered walkway pillars on the pedestrian walkway.",
        "The case for the defence": "7    Although Chng admitted that he understood the s 42A\n\nwarning to mean that his driving licencemightbe forfeited if he did not attend\n\ncourt, his defence was that he was never specifically informed that he had actually been\n\ndisqualified. He did not receive a notice of disqualification, as it was not the practice\n\nof the WEU (confirmed by Sergeant Loh) to send out such notices. He also denied knowing\n\nwhere and when the order of disqualification would be made and he believed that he could\n\ndrive until the court sent him a notice of disqualification as \"everything in\n\nSingapore was in black and white\". Consequently he did not recall that a s 42A\n\nwarning was administered to him until he was stopped on 30 December 2000. It was also\n\nargued on his behalf that the requisite warning under s 42A of the Act was not given to\n\nhim as it had not complied materially with s 42A(d) and this was, accordingly, fatal to a\n\nconviction.",
        "The decision below": "8    In his judgement, the district judge disagreed with\n\nthe submission that the differences in the wording in the s 42A written warning\n\nadministered to Chng and the requirements of s 42A was fatal to the possibility of a\n\nconviction. After all, Chng had conceded that the order of disqualification made on 11\n\nDecember 2000, which was founded upon the s 42A warning, was validly made and in force on\n\n30 December 2000. Furthermore, he was also of the opinion that the differences were\n\nimmaterial and insignificant as no prejudice was caused to him. The district judge\n\naccepted Sergeant Loh’s evidence, in preference to that of Chng, whom he found not to\n\nbe entirely truthful, that notwithstanding the written s 42A warning, he would warn each\n\noffender that their driving licence would be disqualified if he or she did not attend\n\ncourt. The district judge rejected any suggestions that the rules of natural justice had\n\nbeen breached as there was clear and undisputed evidence that Chng had been informed,\n\ndespite of the unsatisfactory wordings of the s 42A warning, of the very possibility that\n\na disqualification order would be ordered by the Court in the event that he failed to\n\nattend court on the date stated.9    The district judge also concluded, after examining\n\ncase authorities and the intention of the legislature as evidenced in the Parliamentary\n\nDebates, that s 43(4) of the Act (driving under disqualification) was a strict liability\n\noffence. He accepted that, followingM V Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 1 CLAS News 357,\n\nthe defence of reasonable care was available to a defendant who had been convicted of a\n\nstrict liability offence. However, the district judge felt that the defence was clearly\n\nnot made out on the facts. Even if Chng might not have been specifically aware that the\n\ncourt had disqualified him when he failed to attend court on the specified date, he\n\nnonetheless should have known that, as a consequence of the s 42A written warning, the\n\ncourt had disqualified him when he failed to attend court on the specified date, yet he\n\nmade no inquiries at all and continued to drive.10 With respect to the s 3(1) charge under the Motor Vehicles (Third\n\nParty Risks and Compensation) Act, the district judge observed that this was an offence\n\nthat would stand or fall together with the offence of driving under disqualification.\n\nSince the offence under s 43(4) of the Act was made out, it followed that Chng must also\n\nbe guilty of the s 3(1) charge.",
        "The appeal": "11    Several grounds of appeal were marshaled on behalf\n\nof the appellant. The arguments with respect to the appeal against conviction were:1 the district judge erred in law and in fact in finding that the\n\n    prosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt2 s 43(4) did not create a strict liability offence and even if s 43(4)\n\n    did create a strict liability offence, Chng had made sufficient inquiries about his status\n\n    to avail himself of the defence of reasonable care.3 the material discrepancies between the written warning and the\n\n    requirements of s 42A(d) of the Act coupled with a failure to serve a notice of\n\n    disqualification on Chng constituted a breach of natural justice.12    As for the appeal against sentence, the submission\n\nwas that the sentence of one month’s imprisonment for the charge of driving under\n\ndisqualification was manifestly excessive and, furthermore, the district judge had failed\n\nto adequately consider the mitigating circumstances raised in the appellant’s favour.",
        "Did the judge err in law and in fact?": "13    Much of the facts were derived from the statement\n\nof agreed facts. These were not in dispute.14 The only relevant issue in contention was whether Sergeant Loh had\n\nadministered the verbal warning in the manner testified. The District Judge held that he\n\nhad. In the absence of any credible evidence to prove that the District Judge had erred in\n\narriving at this finding of fact, I was of the opinion that Chng’s appeal on the\n\nbasis that there had been an error in law and in fact must be dismissed.",
        "Was s 43(4) a strict liability offence?": "15 Section 43(4) Road Traffic Act (Cap 276) reads:If any person who is disqualified as mentioned in\n\n  subsection (3) drives on a road a motor vehicle or, if the disqualification is limited to\n\n  the driving of a motor vehicle of a particular class or description, a motor vehicle of\n\n  that class or description, he shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on\n\n  conviction to a fine not exceeding $10,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 3\n\n  years or to both.16 It is one of the principles of criminal law that a crime is not\n\ncommitted if the mind of the person doing the act in question is innocent;actus non\n\nfacit reum, nisi mens sit rea. Nevertheless the need for an effective policing of\n\npublic welfare offences and the protection of public interest in areas such as health,\n\nsafety and morals have prompted Parliament to legislate for strict liability offences:Sherras\n\nv de Rutzen[1895] 1 QB 918,Lim Chin Aik v R(1963) 29 MLJ 50.17 It was hence recognized by the House of Lords inSweet v Parsley[1969] 1 All ER 347 that the traditional presumption ofmens reamay be displaced,\n\neither by words of the statute creating the offence or by the subject matter with which it\n\ndeals. The court is also invited to look at other relevant factors such as the degree of\n\ncriminality of the offence, the context in which the words are used, the presence of any\n\nstatutory defences, the mischief against which they are directed, the extent of the\n\npunishment imposed and the absence of social obloquy in determining whether the public\n\ninterest will be best served by a construction of strict liability. A caution has also\n\nbeen added to restrict the potential ambit of strict liability. In the words of Lord\n\nDiplock inSweet v Parsleysupra. at p 362:But such an inference [of strict liability] is not\n\n  lightly to be drawn, nor is there any room for it unless there is something that the\n\n  person on whom the obligation is imposed can do directly or indirectly, by supervision or\n\n  inspection, by improvement of his business methods or by exhorting those whom he may be\n\n  expected to influence or control, which will promote the observance of the obligation.A court should hence refrain from construing an offence as one of\n\nstrict liability unless it can also be shown that the creation of strict liability will be\n\neffective to promote the objects of the statute by encouraging greater vigilance to\n\nprevent the commission of the prohibited act:Gammon (Hong Kong) Ltd. v A-G of Hong\n\nKong[1985] 1 AC 1. This, in turn, implies that a defence of reasonable care must be\n\navailable to persons who have tried to comply with the statutory requirements. The\n\navailability of this defence was recognized inR v City of Sault Ste Maria(1978)\n\n85 DLR 161,Proudman v Dayman(1943) 67 CLR 536 and adopted by myself in this court\n\ninM V Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 1 CLAS News 357.18    Turning to s 43(4) of the Act, one observed that there are no\n\nwords such as \"knowingly\" or \"intentionally\", which if present will\n\nindicate the requirement of proof of mens rea. However, I borne in mind the principle that\n\nthe absence of such words was not necessarily conclusive against mens rea being required\n\nin respect of a statutory offence, and went further to determine the immediate textual\n\ncontext, the objectives of the statutory provision as well as the nature of the offence.\n\nIn my opinion, there were several factors, which strongly suggested that Parliament\n\nintended liability to be strict. Firstly, is the absence of any statutory defences for s\n\n43(4) of the Act. Secondly, as is the case for the majority of strict liability offences,\n\nthe offence of driving under disqualification is not a truly \"criminal\" offence\n\nbut one that is regulatory in nature. Thirdly, s 43(4) is clearly concerned with the\n\nprotection and safety of the public as it prohibits persons without valid or subsisting\n\nlicences from driving on our public roads and highways and endangering human lives.\n\nFurther, the reality of the situation is often that a person who drives while disqualified\n\nwill also not be in possession of a valid third-party insurance policy as required by s 3\n\nof the Motor Vehicles (Third-Party Risks and Compensation) Act. Consequently, it was clear\n\nto me that the protection of public interest and the need to avoid the tremendous damage\n\nand injustice that can arise when members of public are injured by such irresponsible\n\ndrivers, mandates the reading of s 43(4) as a strict liability offence. Fourthly, I found\n\nit significant that active promotion of the observance of s 43(4) is very much dependent\n\nupon personal compliance by the individual since the traffic police is often unable, save\n\nin cases where the offender has been stopped for some other offences or on the off-chance\n\nwhen random checks are being conducted, to identify and stop disqualified persons from\n\ndriving on the roads. Applying the reasoning of this court inM V Balakrishnan(supra) when construing s 35 of the Traffic Offences Act – a similar offence that\n\ndeals with driving a class of motor vehicle without the requisite driving licence –\n\nthe prohibited act is not one which the public can easily protect by its own vigilance.\n\nConversely, it is no great hardship for a person who intends to drive to determine whether\n\nor not he is in fact qualified (or disqualified) to do so.19    For the reasons above, I was of the view that the imposition of\n\nstrict liability is required for the protection of the public and to promote the\n\nobservance of s 43(4) by shifting the obligation of compliance to the individual:Gammon\n\n(Hong Kong) Ltd. v A-G of Hong Kong. Such a conclusion is consistent with Lord\n\nEvershed’s decision inLim Chin Aikwhere at p 52 he said,Where the subject matter of the statue is the regulation\n\n  for the public welfare of a particular activity … it frequently has been inferred\n\n  that the legislature intended that such activities should be carried out under conditions\n\n  of strict liability. The presumption is that the statue or statutory instrument can be\n\n  effectively enforced only if those in charge of the relevant activities are made\n\n  responsible for seeing that they are complied with. When such a presumption is to be\n\n  inferred, it displaces the ordinary presumption of mens rea.20 The severity of the penalties which s 43(4) attracts – a\n\nmaximum prison term of three years – does not necessarily bar a construction of\n\nstrict liability. This same argument was made and rejected inGammon (Hong Kong) Ltd. v\n\nA-G of Hong Kongand by me inTan Cheng Kwee v PP(unreported MA No. 332 of\n\n2001), on the basis that the legislature could reasonably have intended severity to be a\n\nsignificant deterrence and there is nothing inconsistent with imposing severe penalties\n\nfor offences of strict liability.",
        "Other considerations": "21 In determining the nature of s 43(4), I also derived much assistance\n\nfrom the speech of the then Minister for Home Affairs, Mr. Wong Kan Seng, during the\n\nsecond reading of the Road Traffic (Amendment No. 2) Bill in Parliament on 20 January 1999\n\nwhen he explained the rationale behind the government’s move to implement tougher\n\nmeasures against recalcitrant motorists against whom there are outstanding warrants of\n\narrest in connection with traffic or parking offences and which ultimately culminated in\n\nthe enactment of s 42A. He said,There were 54,000 outstanding warrants of arrest\n\n  relating to traffic and parking offences as at 30 November last year. 300 motorists had 10\n\n  or more outstanding warrants of arrest.Warrants of arrest are issued against persons who fail to turn up in\n\n  Court when ordered to do so by the Courts. We should take a serious view of such people\n\n  because they basically have no regard for our Courts. On its part, the Police mounts\n\n  regular operations to arrest motorists with outstanding warrants of arrest, including\n\n  paying house visits to their homes. But it is not always able to arrest them because the\n\n  motorists concerned may have either shifted homes or do not reside at the addresses\n\n  provided in the official records.Currently a motorist with an outstanding warrants of arrest relating to\n\n  an offence under the Road Traffic Act or Parking Places Act is allowed to renew his\n\n  driving licence as soon as he has executed his warrant of arrest. Execution here means\n\n  surrendering himself to a Police station or the Warrant Enforcement Unit, and he is\n\n  formally arrested. But during the period when the motorist is released on bail pending the\n\n  Court hearing, some jump bail and do not attend the scheduled Court hearing, thus\n\n  necessitating the issue of a fresh warrant of arrest. This is a blatant abuse of the Court\n\n  process.Hence it was clear to me that Parliament had empowered the courts to\n\ndisqualify motorists possessing valid licences from driving if they had failed to attend\n\ncourt after being arrested under a warrant and released under a bail, as a censure for\n\ntheir blatant disregard for the law and to obviate practical difficulties in enforcement.\n\nReading s 43(4) as requiring mens rea e.g. knowledge of one’s disqualification status\n\nnecessarily implied that a notice of disqualification would then have to be brought to the\n\nattention of the recalcitrant motorist. This would inevitably initiate another rigmarole\n\nof locating and serving these motorists with the notices of disqualification; a\n\nsubstitution of one meaningless procedure for another. The legislative intention of s 42A,\n\nas a tool against errant absentees, would be wholly defeated if the police or the court\n\nwere still required to chase after the offender to inform him of the disqualification\n\norder before it took effect.",
        "Similar English provision": "22 There is a provision in England that is inpari materiawith\n\nour s 43(4). Section 103(1) of the English Road Traffic Act (UK, 1988) reads:A person is guilty of an offence if, while disqualified\n\n  from holding or obtaining a licence, he – (a) obtains a licence, or (b) drives a\n\n  motor vehicle on a road.The leading English text on the subject –Wilkinson’s Road\n\nTraffic Offences– states that, in England, the offence of driving while\n\ndisqualified is one of strict liability. It cites the case ofTaylor v Kenyon[1952] 2 All ER 726 as authority for the principle that it is no defence that the offender\n\ndid not know of the disqualification. Although the appellant accepted this, he argued that\n\nthe facts inTaylor v Kenyonwere \"vastly different\" from those in the\n\npresent appeal and hence distinguishable.23 InTaylor v Kenyon, the respondent was charged with driving a\n\nmotor vehicle at an excessive speed. Like the appellant in our case, the respondent failed\n\nto attend the hearing, at which he was convicted, fined and disqualified for three months.\n\nWhat was different was this: the respondent’s licence was retained by the court and a\n\nletter was sent informing him of the disqualification together with a notice of fine\n\nenclosed in the same envelope. The respondent paid the fine, but subsequently drove\n\nwithout his licence. When charged with driving while disqualified for holding a licence,\n\nhe denied any knowledge of the disqualification. Chng hence argued that the decision inTaylorwas largely predicated upon the fact that the respondent in that case had notice of the\n\ndisqualification and could not then be heard to plead ignorance. He further invited me to\n\ninfer a requirement in English law that notice of any disqualification will have to be\n\ngiven to the person disqualified and, in the absence of such a notice, any subsequent\n\nprosecution will fail.24 I disagreed with the appellant’s reading of the case on several\n\ncounts. Firstly, the language of the court inTaylorwas clearly unequivocal. Lord\n\nGoddard C.J., giving the leading judgement of the court, pronounced that \"in s 7(4)\n\nof the Road Traffic Act 1930, there is anabsoluteprohibition against a person\n\ndriving when he is disqualified….\" Secondly, inTayloritself, the\n\nsuggestion that a notice of disqualification is mandatory in English law to secure a\n\nconviction was also doubted. Lord Goddard C.J., while noting that it was a very proper\n\nthing for the court clerk to send the respondent a notice of disqualification, questioned\n\nits necessity in law as the decision of the justices once pronounced in open court and\n\nentered in the court register became the judgment of the court. Thirdly, theratio\n\ndecidendiofTaylor v Kenyonhas since been universally accepted and assumed by\n\nsubsequent courts in that jurisdiction to be that lack of knowledge of disqualification is\n\nno defence. This is regardless of whether a notice of disqualification had been sent to\n\nthe accused or not. For support of this principle, I need only refer toR v Bowsher[1973] RTR 202 where the English Court of Appeal upheld a conviction although the\n\ndefendant in that case had his licence returned to him in error by the licencing\n\nauthority. Other notable examples included:R v Lynn[1971] RTR 369,R v Miller[1975] RTR 479,Singh (Jaspal) v Director of Public Prosecutions[1999] RTR 424.25 As both principle and authorities supported reading s 43(4) as a\n\nstrict liability offence, I was firmly of the view that Chng’s argument to the\n\ncontrary should be rejected. Once it was established that Chng drove while disqualified,\n\nhe was liable regardless of whether he had knowledge of the disqualification order or not.\n\nIn any event, I shared the opinion of the district judge that Chng probably did have the\n\nrequisite knowledge that he had been disqualified on 11 December 2000 since he wrote to\n\nthe Court the next day applying to have his second warrant of arrest cancelled.",
        "Did Chng exercise reasonable care?": "26 Since s 43(4) did not create anabsoluteliability offence,\n\nonce the prosecution had proved the elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt i.e.\n\nChng drove a motor vehicle and he drove it while he was disqualified, the burden then\n\nshifted to Chng to prove that he had exercised reasonable care to comply with the\n\nrequirements of the provision. In order to succeed, Chng must show that he had made\n\ndiligent inquiries about his qualification status or had an honest or reasonable belief\n\nthat he could still drive.27 From the evidence that had been adduced in the court below, there\n\nwas little to show that Chng had indeed exercised due care and diligence. Chng absented\n\nhimself from court on the first occasion on 14 August 2000. He was arrested and then\n\nwarned by Sergeant Loh in October 2000 to attend court, failing which he would be\n\ndisqualified. A written warning under s 42A was also served upon him. Despite both the\n\nverbal and written warnings, Chng saw fit not to attend court again on 11 December 2000 as\n\nhe said he was too busy with work. Although Chng did subsequently manage to go to the\n\nSubordinate Courts the next day, he took little effort to inquire about his\n\ndisqualification status. What inquiry he made was limited to asking a counter-staff about\n\nwhat would happen to his warrant of arrest. While it was true that the staff should have\n\ninformed Chng of his disqualification status, however, when told that she did not know,\n\nChng asked no further questions as he had apparently forgotten all about the s 42A written\n\nwarning. In fact, Chng admitted that he did not ask anyone if he had been disqualified.28 Neither did I think that Chng’s subsequent conduct of writing\n\nto the Subordinate Courts on 12 December 2000 discharged his burden of taking reasonable\n\ncare as that related exclusively to representations for the warrant of arrest to be\n\ndischarged. In any event, Chng evidently did not find it necessary to wait for a reply\n\nfrom the courts before he decided to drive again. In addition, when queried about the\n\nbasis for his expectation that a written notice of disqualification would be sent to him,\n\nChng admitted that he had never been informed by anyone, much less Sergeant Loh, that\n\nthere would be such a notice. It was purely a personal belief in a state of things; the\n\ntruth of which was neither verified nor ascertained. There was hence no reasonable or\n\nhonest belief substantiating his conduct to speak of. In the circumstances, I found that\n\nthere was a deplorable lack of due diligence on Chng’s part and, for that reason, the\n\ndefence of reasonable care cannot be made out.",
        "Was there a breach of natural justice?": "29 The rules of natural justice require the bringing of an offence to\n\nthe notice of the person charged. Chng’s objections could be summarized as follows:a The offence was never brought to his notice because of the\n\n  differences in the wording of the written warning and the requirements of s 42A.b Alternatively, the offence was not brought to his notice because no\n\n  notice was sent informing him of the order to disqualify him.30 The discrepancy between s 42A and the written warning should first\n\nbe set out. Section 42A states:s 42A–(1) The Public Prosecutormayapply to\n\n  the court for an order disqualifying a person from holding or obtaining a driving licence\n\n  if –…(d) he has been duly informed by –(ii) the officer who arrested him…that should he fail to appear in court on the date next appointed for\n\n  his appearance in connection with the offence of which he is accused, thePublic\n\n  Prosecutor shall make an applicationunder this section for him to be disqualified\n\n  from holding or obtaining a driving licence… (emphasis added)However, the s 42A written warning which was administered to Chng\n\nstated that the \"prosecutionmaymake an application to the Court … to\n\nhave his driving licence disqualified\". Hence while s 42A requires the accused to be\n\ndefinitively informed that he will be disqualified, the warning only spoke of the\n\npossibility of disqualification.",
        "Was notice vitiated by non-compliance with s 42A?": "31    The problem was whether, as a result of the written warning\n\nnot complying with s 42A, there had been a breach of natural justice, in particular the\n\nrule,audi alteram partem.The rules of natural justice require that: persons\n\nliable to be directly affected by the outcome of any decision must be given prior\n\nnotification of the action proposed to be taken, of the time and place of any hearing that\n\nis to be conducted, and of the charge or case they will be called upon to meet. There is\n\nalso a necessary implication that notice must not only be given, but that it was\n\nsufficient and accurate.32 I was of the opinion that, in order for notice to be vitiated by\n\nnon-compliance with s 42A, the non-compliance must be fundamental, substantive and\n\nmaterial in nature. The discrepancies must be such as tomisleadChng as to the\n\nconsequences of his failure to attend court, hence depriving him of his right to be heard.\n\nThis was not so on the facts of our case. Chng was administered with the written warning,\n\nwhich warned him of the possibility that his licence could be disqualified. Sergeant Loh\n\nalso advised him that his licencewould bedisqualified if he failed to attend\n\ncourt for a second time. He was also informed of his right to be heard in court and the\n\ndate, place and time of the hearing; a right which he knowingly and willingly forfeited by\n\nhis non-attendance. At all times, I found that Chng was aware of the consequence of being\n\ndisqualified. He himself admitted that at the time when the s 42A warning was administered\n\nto him, his understanding of the consequences of non-attendance was not, in any way,\n\naffected by the wording of the written warning. It would be overtly artificial, in the\n\ncircumstances, to hold that notice of the consequences (i.e. disqualification) wasneverbrought to his attention and that, consequently, there had been a breach of natural\n\njustice. The written warning though discrepant with the requirements of s 42A, had\n\nsufficiently served its purpose of informing Chng of the risk of disqualification and the\n\nsentences for the consequential substantive offence of driving while disqualified (these\n\nwere stated clearly and in bold in the s 42A warning that was served on him). In any case,\n\nthe written warning accurately represented the reality of the situation: the public\n\nprosecution might (and not would) apply for the driver to be disqualified.33 Further, to warrant a finding of a breach of natural justice, the\n\napplicant i.e. Chng must prove that he had suffered substantial prejudice or injusticeas\n\na resultof the non-compliance with s 42A, since there is no such thing in law as a\n\ntechnical breach of natural justice:George v Secretary of State for the Environment\n\n& Anor[1979] 38 P & CR 609. I considered that little prejudice was caused to\n\nChng. He read the notice, he knew of the consequences for non-attendance but he promptly\n\nforgot all about it. According to Chng, the possibility of disqualification never even\n\ncrossed his mind when he decided to work instead of attending court. Chng could not then\n\nbe heard to argue that he had suffered injustice as a result of the wording of the written\n\nwarning when he had never relied upon it. Neither was the sentence imposed by the district\n\njudge under s 43(4) a relevant prejudice, as disqualification was a risk, which Chng\n\nwillingly and, to a certain extent, knowingly undertook. In any event, he had conceded\n\nthat the disqualification order was validly and properly made; a concession that was\n\ninherently contradictory with his claims of there being a breach of natural justice.",
        "Did Chng have the right to demand a notice of disqualification?": "34 It had been accepted inBanks v Transport Regulation Board\n\n(Victoria)(1968) 119 CLR 222 andMcInnes v Onslow-Fane[1978] 1 WLR 1520 that\n\nthe revocation of a licence is a deprivation of a legal right which attracts the\n\nprotection of procedural fairness. Chng hence argued that he had either the right or a\n\nlegitimate expectation to be subsequently informed of the order of disqualification that\n\nhad been made against him, and, in its absence, he was entitled to assume that he could\n\ncontinue to drive.35    A distinction must be drawn here. Natural justice is concerned\n\nwith procedural fairness prior to and during the adjudication of the courts or\n\nadministrative tribunals. The maxims,audi alteram partemandnemo judex in\n\ncausa suahave technically no application after a decision has been reached and the\n\nadjudication process is concluded. Therefore when the cases speak of ‘notice’,\n\nthey are referring topriornotice of the offence, the charges that will be\n\npreferred and the hearing at which a decision will be made. They do not mean that the\n\naccused or the person affected is alsoentitledto notice of the final decision of\n\nthe court or tribunal if they choose to absent themselves from the proceedings and then\n\nomit to make any inquiries. Since the pronouncement of disqualification is made in open\n\ncourt, there should be no further need to notify the accused of the order of the court.36    Even if I was wrong in holding that the rules of natural justice\n\nhad no application when the adjudication process had been concluded, there is a decision\n\nof the Privy Council inDe Verteuil v Knaggs[1918] AC 557 which held that the\n\npresumption of natural justice can be displaced where it is impracticable not to\n\notherwise. Unless the court exercises its powers of suspension under s 42(3) of the Road\n\nTraffic Act, disqualification usually takes effect as from the date of the court order.\n\nHence if this court decided that there is indeed a legal duty on the part of the WEU to\n\nsend out notices of disqualification, there will be a lapse of time between the date of\n\npronouncement in court and the date when the offender actually receives the notice. The\n\nuncertainty is augmented in those situations when an offender who has failed to attend\n\ncourt and who has not received the notice of disqualification, is caught driving while\n\ndisqualified during this ‘limbo’ period. Consequent problems such as whether he\n\nshould be prosecuted, what is a ‘reasonable window of time’ for the notices to\n\nbe received, what should be done if the notices never arrive or are never read at the\n\ndesignated addresses and etc. will arise. There will also be an impact on the standard\n\nrequired to make out a defence of reasonable care. On balance, I found it more appropriate\n\nnot to impose alegal dutyon the part of the WEU to send out notices of\n\ndisqualification and consequently, Chng hadno legal rightto be subsequently\n\ninformed of the result of the decision of the tribunal.37    In any case, this argument (that a notice should have been sent to\n\nChng) was obviated by the finding of fact that Chng probably knew about his\n\ndisqualification status as early as 11 December 2000.38    With respect to legitimate expectations, the reasoning of the\n\ncourts inAG of Hong Kong v Ng Yuen Shiu[1983] 2 AC 629 andRe Siah Mooi Guat[1988] SLR 766 were instructive. Since no representations or promises were ever made by\n\nSergeant Loh or the WEU that such notices of disqualification would be sent out, it was\n\nunreasonable for Chng to have assumed otherwise. Neither was there an established practice\n\nof sending out such notices by the WEU upon which Chng could rely. On the contrary, the\n\nevidence adduced below was that it had never been the practice of the traffic police to do\n\nso. The principle of legitimate expectations arising from the existence of a regular\n\npractice which the claimant could reasonably expect to continue inR v Secretary of\n\nState for the Home Department ex p. Asif Mahmood Khan[1984] 1 WLR 1337 andCouncil\n\nof Civil Service Unions v Minister for Civil Service[1985] 1 AC 374 was hence\n\ninapplicable. Chng did not have either the right or the legitimate expectation that a\n\nnotice of disqualification would be sent to him.39    In view of the above reasons, I could not accept Chng’s\n\nargument that there had been a breach of natural justice.",
        "Should the WEU nevertheless have such a practice of sending out\n\ndisqualification notices?": "40 The United States Supreme Court inMathews v Elridge(1976)\n\n424 US 319 held that the availability of procedural rights depended on:i the interest of the individualii risk of any onerous deprivation of that interest through the\n\n  procedures actually usediii probable value of additional procedural safeguardsiv the government interest, including the costs imposed by the\n\n  additional procedural requirement.41 Although I had stated my opinion that the WEU has no duty in law to\n\nsend out disqualification notices, I considered that there may be good reasons for it to\n\nadopt such a practice administratively. First, it is possible that many Singaporeans are\n\nlabouring under the mistaken assumption that notices of disqualification will be sent to\n\nthem. Secondly, driving while disqualified is viewed as a serious offence attracting a\n\ncustodial sentence of up to three years. Thirdly, the probable costs and manpower required\n\nfor this additional procedural safeguard are unlikely to be too large. The traffic police,\n\nmuch like any other governmental agency, should have sufficient resources to generate\n\nnotices of disqualification on a large-scale. However, a caveat must be added that these\n\nnotices do not affect the date from which the order of disqualification is ordered to take\n\neffect or the nature of s 43(4) as a strict liability offence. Unless the court orders\n\notherwise, disqualification takes effect from the date of the court order and not the date\n\nof receipt of the notice. In addition, the Traffic Police or the WEU may also wish to\n\nconsider rewording the written warnings administered to the motorists to accurately\n\nreflect the requirements in s 42A(d). This will pre-empt similar arguments of breaches of\n\nnatural justice by offenders in future.",
        "Was the sentence manifestly excessive?": "42 InSamnasivam s/o Sharma v PP[1992] 2 SLR 580, I held that\n\nunless special circumstances of the case can be shown, magistrates should not hesitate to\n\nimpose a substantial sentence of imprisonment. That statement of mine should now be\n\nre-considered in the light of legislative amendments to s 43(4) in April 1993. On 25 April\n\n1993, Parliament amended the provision by removing the words \"special\n\ncircumstances\" hence eliminating the fetter on the court’s discretion to impose\n\na custodial sentence. The current position in the amended s 43(4) is that an offender\n\nshall be liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10, 000 or to imprisonment for a\n\nterm not exceeding three years or to both. The courts now clearly have an absolute\n\ndiscretion in every situation to determine the types and extent of the various sentencing\n\noptions, subject to the limits of punishment as prescribed by the legislature.43    I was firmly of the view that the courts have an interest and a\n\nduty to the people of Singapore to ensure strict compliance with our safety regulations\n\nand promote the safety and security of our roads and highways. Driving while under\n\ndisqualification is about as serious an offence as a motorist can commit. Not only does it\n\ncompromise the safety of our roads; it also creates problems in ensuring adequate\n\ncompensation for luckless victims. Prima facie, motorists who drive while disqualified\n\nmust now expect a term of imprisonment and not merely a fine. In addition, the\n\nirresponsible motorist who has knowledge of an order of disqualification made against him\n\nbut who continues to drive in blatant disregard of the law and the authority of the courts\n\ncan also expect to face the full impact of the law upon him and receive enhanced custodial\n\nsentences.44 Chng’s conduct in ignoring a notice to appear in court to\n\nanswer a charge, even when the offence was a relatively minor offence such as a parking\n\ninfringement, was a grave matter as it showed his blatant disregard of the law. Parliament\n\nhas also time and again emphasized that it takes a stern view of motorists who do not\n\ncomply with such notices. Bearing in mind the maximum limits of imprisonment as imposed by\n\ns 43(4), the culpability of Chng’s conduct in failing to take reasonable care and the\n\nseriousness with which the legislature views such offences, I did not consider the\n\nsentence of one month’s imprisonment to be manifestly excessive. In arriving at this\n\ndecision, I had also taken into account the fact that Chng had no prior antecedents.",
        "Conclusion": "45 For the above reasons, I dismissed the appeals with respect to the\n\nfirst charge of driving while disqualified under s 43(4) of the Road Traffic Act and the\n\nthird charge of driving without a valid insurance policy under s 3(1) of the Motor\n\nVehicles (Third Party Risks and Compensation) Act.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
