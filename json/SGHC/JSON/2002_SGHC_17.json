        "The Law on QC admission": "3 Section 21 of the Act states as follows:(1) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court\n\n  may, for the purpose of any one case where the court is satisfied that it is of sufficient\n\n  difficulty and complexity having regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to\n\n  practise as an advocate and solicitor any person who –(a) holds Her Majesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel;(b) does not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has\n\n    come or intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the case; and(c) has special qualifications or experience for the purpose of the\n\n    case.4 The requirements of s 21 were clearly set out by Yong Pung How CJ inRe\n\nCaplan Jonathan Michael QC(No 2)[1998] 1 SLR 440at [para 11]:At the first stage, the applicant must demonstrate that the case in\n\n  which he seeks to appear contains issues of law and/or fact of sufficient difficulty and\n\n  complexity to require elucidation and/or argument by a Queen’s Counsel. Such\n\n  difficulty or complexity is not of itself a guarantee of admission, for the decision to\n\n  admit is still a matter for the court’s discretion. At the second stage, therefore,\n\n  the applicant must persuade the court that the circumstances of the particular case\n\n  warrant the court exercising its discretion in favour of his admission. Finally, he has to\n\n  satisfy the court of his suitability for admission.5 By s 21 of the Act Parliament conferred on a QC the eligibility to\n\napply for ad hoc admission. The conferment of that privilege must obviously be predicated\n\nupon at least two essential qualities which an applicant must possess. First, and it is of\n\nfundamental importance, we must be satisfied that by his reputation and conduct he will be\n\nresponsible, honourable, courteous and respectful of our Judiciary. Though it is his duty\n\nto advance the cause of those instructing him fearlessly and with courage in accordance\n\nwith his duties to his lay client, he should never under any circumstances allow his\n\npersonal feelings or those of his lay client to affect his duty as officer of the court to\n\nbe courteous and respectful to our judges and our Judiciary. Further, and it is beyond\n\nquestion, he should never scandalise, disparage or insult our judges and our Judiciary. If\n\nhe has dishonoured the Judiciary he cannot reasonably expect to be honoured by being\n\nadmitted as an honourable advocate and solicitor in our courts.6 Secondly, he must prove that he is an experienced QC and is plainly\n\nat the forefront of his area of specialisation so that he can adequately assist our courts\n\nin our deliberations and the administration of justice.",
        "The Facts": "7 In support of the application, Dr Chee filed a brief affidavit. He\n\nstated that Mr Littlemore is a Queen’s Counsel as from 9 December 1992. He confirmed\n\nthat Mr Littlemore did not ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia. Paragraphs 5 to 7\n\nof the affidavit were couched in the following terms:\"5. The applicant has special experience for the purpose of the\n\n  cases, in that he is an advocate specialising in defamation in all the States and\n\n  Territories of Australia, Papua New Guinea, and the United States of America.6. The cases are extremely complex defamation matters, involving\n\n  factual and legal issues of publication and republication; qualified privilege, contextual\n\n  truth, comment and justification; there are also Counterclaims in defamation, and Third\n\n  Party claims.7. The nature of the issues in the case and the identify and positions\n\n  of the Plaintiffs are further powerful reasons why it is proper and necessary for me to\n\n  engage the services of leading Counsel from outside Singapore. I believe that the\n\n  Applicant with his expertise and experience will be in the best position to assist the\n\n  Court in coming to a just and fair decision.\"8 Mr Jeffrey Chan, Senior State Counsel, filed an affidavit with the\n\nauthority of the Attorney General to set out the facts in opposing the application. It was\n\ndisclosed that Mr Littlemore was in Singapore from 8thto 12thAugust 1997 and attended the defamation trial in the case of Goh Chok Tong v J B\n\nJeyaretnam in his capacity as an observer for the International Commission of Jurists\n\n(\"ICJ\"). As an observer from the ICJ, he was accorded all appropriate courtesies\n\nby the court hearing the matter. Mr Littlemore subsequently submitted a report on the\n\ntrial and the judgment of the court. On 1stOctober 1997 the ICJ released a\n\ncopy of the report which elicited from the Ministry of Law, Singapore a point-to-point\n\nrebuttal. For present purposes, it is unnecessary to consider those points in issue. My\n\nreference to the controversy is merely to provide the backdrop.9 Following the release of the report by ICJ Mr Littlemore was\n\ninterviewed by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. This interview was broadcast on 14thOctober 1997. A transcript of the interview was produced before me as an exhibit. Its\n\naccuracy was not challenged by Dr Chee. Among other things, Mr Littlemore uttered the\n\nfollowing:\"The ICJ is dedicated to the rule of law. That is, a government of\n\n  laws, not of men – the rule of laws, not men. Now that’s very uncomfortable for\n\n  a regime that does impeccably in its judiciary on commercial matters – you\n\n  couldn’t fault the Courts – but when it comes to human rights, they really\n\n  don’t matter...\"... ... ...\"I think it’s paying judges eight hundred thousand a year\n\n  – or the chief judge, 1.2 million. I mean people in Singapore... lawyers will say to\n\n  you ... that guarantees the independence of the judiciary. I think anybody would say no,\n\n  it puts the judiciary in the pocket of the government... And you know, when judges are\n\n  appointed in Singapore, they serve two and a half years probation. Now, the idea of that\n\n  is anathema to people who believe in an independent judiciary.\"10 Mr Littlemore repeated his attacks on the Singapore Judiciary on 15thOctober 1997 in his article which was published in the Sydney Morning Herald. A copy of\n\nthe article was also exhibited in these proceedings. He wrote, among other things, the\n\nfollowing:\"The Singapore High Court has a regrettable reputation as\n\n  compliant with the interests of the Government. Its judges are paid S$800,000 (US$703,730)\n\n  a year, and the Chief Justice S$1,200,000 (A$1,055,600) – a situation which, far from\n\n  demonstrating the independence of the judiciary, provides a very persuasive basis for\n\n  concluding that the judiciary would be highly motivated to comply with the Government\n\n  priorities.While the rest of the common-law world has formulated a \"public\n\n  figure\" test for defamation or treated political life as requiring a higher degree of\n\n  robust tolerance, and while such jurisdictions have also placed reasonable limits on\n\n  damages awards, the Singapore judiciary is exposed as unable to accommodate the\n\n  fundamental right of free speech alongside the right to protection of reputation.\"Submissions11 Mr Jeffrey Chan for the Attorney General submitted that Mr\n\nLittlemore had deliberately disparaged the Singapore Judiciary and the Government of\n\nSingapore. He said that Mr Littlemore not only had insulted the Judiciary but he had\n\npresented distorted facts of proceedings before our courts in order to propagate a biased\n\nand loathsome image of the Judiciary.12 Counsel for the Law Society of Singapore informed the court that the\n\nLaw Society of Singapore had studied the affidavit of Mr Jeffrey Chan and the statements\n\nmade by Mr Littlemore concerning the Singapore Judiciary . Counsel said: \"(w)e are of\n\nthe view that these statements are such as to bring into question his suitability and\n\nfitness to be accorded the privilege of being admitted to appear before a Judiciary of\n\nwhich he thinks and speaks with such derision.\"13 Dr Chee initially declined to reply to those submissions but later,\n\nafter I had dismissed his application, he told me that he failed to see how Mr\n\nLittlemore’s views could impact on Mr Littlemore being able to represent him. He saw\n\nthose \"as very different matters\". They are not; honourable conduct must go hand\n\nin hand with technical competence in the case of every officer of our courts.",
        "Conclusion": "14 As I had said in open court, I concluded that Mr Littlemore had\n\nshown us contempt and had been utterly disrespectful. He came across to me as a person who\n\nlacked \"decency, measure and maturity\". I could not trust him to assist our\n\ncourts in our deliberations in relation to the suits against Dr Chee. I also said that our\n\nJudiciary could not possibly be expected to honour those who dishonoured us, disparaged\n\nus, and who said such hurtful things about us.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
