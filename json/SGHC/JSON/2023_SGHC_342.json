        "Background facts": "4 I begin with the background, as framed by the Liquidators, to the present applications. I emphasise that my citation of the background facts is restricted to the purposes of the present applications only.",
        "The Envy Companies’ purported business of nickel trading": "5 From around January 2016 to around April 2020, EAM purported to purchase quantities of London Metal Exchange (“LME”) Nickel Grade Metal (“Poseidon Nickel”) from an Australian company, Poseidon Nickel Limited. In particular, EAM purported to have purchased Poseidon Nickel at a 16% to 25% discount compared to the average of the LME nickel official daily cash settlement prices for the month prior to the month when shipment was scheduled. EAM then purported to sell Poseidon Nickel to third party buyers at a higher price. 6 By virtue of the above purported arrangements, Investors stood to earn a cut of the profit by entering into a LOA with EAM. Under the terms of the LOA, each Investor would pay an investment amount to EAM to be used “solely for investment in LME Nickel Grade Metal” or “solely for investment in LME Grade Nickel Concentrates” for a three-month period.2Foot Note 2×6th Affidavit of Bob Yap Cheng Ghee dated 6 June 2023 (“BYCG’s 6th Affidavit”) at para 2.1.2(c).However, in certain cases, Investors could commit to multiple, consecutive three-month tranches upfront. Upon the maturity date of the LOA, the Investor would be entitled to a return of the “Investment Amount”, which is the Investor’s original principal amount plus any “Appreciation, net of any Commission, Shipping and Insurance costs and Hedging costs”.3Foot Note 3×BYCG’s 6th Affidavit at para 2.1.2(d)(ii).Investors could then decide whether to fully or partially withdraw their returns or reinvest their returns under a new LOA.",
        "The transfer of business from EAM to EGT": "7 On 19 March 2020, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) placed EAM on its Investor Alert List. MAS did this to “highlight that EAM may have been wrongly perceived as being licensed by MAS”.4Foot Note 4×BYCG’s 6th Affidavit at para 2.1.3.According to a statement that MAS released at the material time, it had “received public feedback that EAM had told [Investors] that it was in the process of applying for a license from MAS, when in fact no such application had been submitted”.5Foot Note 5×BYCG’s 6th Affidavit at para 2.1.3. 8 Following the actions taken by MAS, the Envy Companies were restructured. From around April 2020, EAM’s business of purported nickel trading was transferred to EGT. Thereafter, Investors who invested in the purported nickel trading did so by way of RPAs instead of LOAs. Under the terms of the RPAs, the Investor would directly purchase a proportion of the receivables that EGT was purportedly entitled to receive under a Forward Contract with a third-party buyer at a certain “Sale Price”. The Investor would profit from the difference between the “Sale Price” and the proportion of the receivables that the Investor is entitled to. In addition, Investors had to be accredited investors (“AI”) as defined in the Securities and Futures Act 2001 (2020 Rev Ed) before they could continue investing in the purported nickel trading. 9 However, since not all of the Investors qualified as an AI, several Investors reinvested purported returns from their LOAs/RPAs through accounts other than their personal investment accounts with the Envy Companies. These primarily took place through: (a) the investment account of a third-party AI; and/or (b) a joint account with another Investor (“Joint Account”). Some of the Investors would reinvest their purported returns by means other than their personal investment accounts (with the Envy Companies) through other third parties such as family members, and may claim beneficial interest over those investments.",
        "The winding up of the Envy Companies": "10 On 22 March 2021, the Commercial Affairs Department announced that it had preferred charges against the Envy Companies’ key person, Mr Ng Yu Zhi (“NYZ”), for cheating and fraudulent trading. On 15 April 2021, the Envy Companies filed applications to place themselves under judicial management. Interim judicial managers (“IJMs”) were appointed over the Envy Companies on 27 April 2021. The IJMs were tasked with, among other things, preparing a report on the financial position of the Envy Companies, along with their views on the prospects of the objectives of judicial management being achieved. 11 On 25 May 2021, the IJMs issued the Interim Judicial Managers’ Report (the “Interim Report”). The IJMs found that “the Companies’ [p]urported [n]ickel [t]rading was non-existent, and documents presented to [them] in support of the [p]urported [n]ickel [t]rading were forgeries”.6Foot Note 6×Applicant’s Bundle of Documents Vol 1, at p 138; Interim Judicial Managers’ Report dated 25 May 2021 at para 5.8.1.The IJMs therefore concluded that “none of the purposes of a judicial management as set out in section 89(1) of the IRDA can be achieved”.7Foot Note 7×Applicant’s Bundle of Documents Vol 1, at p 139; Interim Judicial Managers’ Report dated 25 May 2021 at para 6.1.1.This was not only because the purported nickel trading was non-existent, but because the Envy Companies did not undertake in any other meaningful business. Moreover, the Envy Companies’ known assets were grossly insufficient to meet the potential claims of the Envy Companies’ creditors. 12 On 2 July 2021, the IJMs issued the Update to the Interim Report (the “Update”). The IJMs then applied on the same day to wind up the Envy Companies since there was no meaningful business to rehabilitate. On 16 August 2021, a winding up order was made against each of the Envy Companies.",
        "Events leading to the present applications": "13 In the Update, the IJMs identified claims against certain Investors (the “Overwithdrawn Investors”) for: (a) referral fees paid by the Envy Companies; and/or (b) the Overwithdrawn Sums, as a potential avenue of recovery for the Envy Companies. By way of letters of demand dated between September 2022 and February 2023, the Liquidators wrote to the Overwithdrawn Investors to demand the return of the Overwithdrawn Sums. One hundred of the Overwithdrawn Investors responded to claim that they reinvested part of, or the entirety of, their referral fees and/or Overwithdrawn Sums in the Envy Companies through a third party’s account and/or a Joint Account. 14 On 26 September 2022, the Liquidators filed various applications to seek the court’s approval of the Liquidators’ use of the “running account” approach to adjudicate on the Investors’ proofs of debts. During the hearings of those applications in November 2022, the Liquidators were asked how they would treat the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors. The Liquidators responded that they would allow the Overwithdrawn Investors to consolidate and net-off the sums reinvested. However, the Liquidators would seek the approval of the Committee of Inspection (“COI”) or the court for such an approach after they had verified the sums reinvested by the Overwithdrawn Investors. 15 On 7 February 2023, a single COI over the Envy Companies was constituted. On 21 February 2023, the COI gave its in-principle approval of the Proposed Consolidation. However, the COI’s approval was subject to the court’s approval of the Proposed Consolidation in the present applications. In addition, any and all agreements between the Liquidators and the relevant individuals as a consequence of the application of the Proposed Consolidation shall be presented to the COI and will ultimately be subject to the COI’s approval. 16 It was against these background facts that the Liquidators made the present applications. Once again, I emphasise that these are the facts as framed by the Liquidators and can have no bearing on other related proceedings.",
        "The relevant issues": "17 In my view, there were two issues for my determination. The first was whether the Liquidators could even rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA. The second related but ultimately distinct question was, if the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3), whether the court should make the directions sought by the Liquidators. In the end, I decided both questions in the Liquidators’ favour and made the directions sought by the Liquidators.",
        "Whether the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA": "18 As mentioned above, in considering the present applications, I began with a threshold question: could the Liquidators rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA to bring these applications in the first place?",
        "The applicable principles": "32 To begin with, I highlight again that there are two distinct requirements involved in an application under s 145(3) of the IRDA. First, there is the threshold question of whether a liquidator may apply to the court for directions. Second, the court must also be satisfied that the directions soughtshouldbe granted. These requirements should not be conflated: while the former goes to a question of the nature of the direction sought, the latter concerns the court’s assessment of whether it benefits the liquidation to grant the direction. 33 In considering whether the directions sought under s 145(3) of the IRDA should be granted, I considered Black J’s observations inReOctaviar Limitedto be helpful. The learned judge had opined (at [8]) that a court can make the directions sought “where it is advantageous to the liquidation to do so”. In deciding this, a court should be satisfied that the directions sought are proper and reasonable, which can be ascertained by considering, among other things, the liquidator’s reasons, and the process by which the directions had been formulated. 34 Further, as Pritchard J helpfully observed in the Western Australia Supreme Court decision ofReGreat Southern Managers Australia Ltd (in liq)[2014] WASC 312 (at [63]), this determination will “necessarily involve a broad consideration of matters” in the overall context of the liquidation, which include: (a) the nature of the proposed course of action about which the direction is sought; (b) the circumstances relevant to that proposed course of action; (c) the reasons for and consequences of that proposed course of action, including the liquidator’s commercial judgment; and (d) in cases involving the determination of a legal issue relevant to that decision, the principles relevant to the determination of that issue. 35 As mentioned above at [23] and [25], ss 479(3) and 511 of the Corporations Act 2001 have been repealed. Their replacement is s 90-15 of the Insolvency Practice Schedule (Corporations) (“IPS”) of Schedule 2 to the Corporations Act 2001, which I set out for completeness: 90-15  Court may make orders in relation to external administration Court may make orders (1)  The Court may make such orders as it thinks fit in relation to the external administration of a company. Orders on own initiative or on application (2)  The Court may exercise the power under subsection (1): (a)  on its own initiative, during proceedings before the Court; or (b)  on application under section 90- 20. Examples of orders that may be made (3)  Without limiting subsection (1), those orders may include any one or more of the following: (a)  an order determining any question arising in the external administration of the company; (b)  an order that a person cease to be the external administrator of the company; (c)  an order that another registered liquidator be appointed as the external administrator of the company; (d)  an order in relation to the costs of an action (including court action) taken by the external administrator of the company or another person in relation to the external administration of the company; (e)  an order in relation to any loss that the company has sustained because of a breach of duty by the external administrator; (f)  an order in relation to remuneration, including an order requiring a person to repay to a company, or the creditors of a company, remuneration paid to the person as external administrator of the company. Matters that may be taken into account (4)  Without limiting the matters which the Court may take into account when making orders, the Court may take into account: (a)  whether the liquidator has faithfully performed, or is faithfully performing, the liquidator’s duties; and (b)  whether an action or failure to act by the liquidator is in compliance with this Act and the Insolvency Practice Rules; and (c)  whether an action or failure to act by the liquidator is in compliance with an order of the Court; and (d)  whether the company or any other person has suffered, or is likely to suffer, loss or damage because of an action or failure to act by the liquidator; and (e)  the seriousness of the consequences of any action or failure to act by the liquidator, including the effect of that action or failure to act on public confidence in registered liquidators as a group. …",
        "My decision: the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA": "31 Having had regard to the applicable principles, I concluded that the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3) of the IRDA. I was satisfied that the present applications involved potentially controversial issues of law and principle. Indeed, the Liquidators’ views on these issues, and their proposed course of action in the form of the Proposed Consolidation, may be subject to criticism by opposing creditors. As such, I decided that the Liquidators could rely on s 145(3). However, whether I should grant the specific directions sought was a different question, to which I now turn.",
        "Whether the directions sought should be made": "",
        "My decision: the directions sought should be made": "36 Having regard to the applicable principles, I concluded that the directions sought by the Liquidators should be made. 37 First, I accepted the Liquidators’ explanation that the Proposed Consolidation does not benefit one group of creditors over another by contravening theparipassuprinciple. This is because the Proposed Consolidation is merely an extension of the “running account” approach, which the Liquidators have consistently applied to claims against and by all of the Investors to determine each Investor’s true outstanding claim. By the running account approach, the Liquidators would treat all dollars in and out of the Envy Companies as attributable to an Investor as part of a single “running account” for that Investor. This would apply whether the moneys in or out of the Envy Companies were accounted for in the Investor’s personal account or an Investor’s investment through a third-party AI, a Joint Account, or through other third parties such as family members. As such, the Proposed Consolidation would simply lay bare the true outstanding claim of an Overwithdrawn Investor. Rather than being a contravention of theparipassuprinciple, the Proposed Consolidation would allow the Liquidators to determine the true claims of the Investors and give effect to that principle in the specific circumstances of the Envy Companies. 38 Second, the Proposed Consolidation is in the best interests of the estate of the Envy Companies and the general body of creditors. Subject to further agreement, the Proposed Consolidation would allow the Liquidators to compromise claims by the Envy Companies against certain Overwithdrawn Investors, and avoid significant time and costs involved in commencing separate proceedings against them. The Proposed Consolidation would also allow the Liquidators more certainty in the adjudication process and allow the Liquidators to determine the total liabilities more accurately and/or claims of the Envy Companies. 39 Third, the COI and the investors’ working group comprising 108 Investors are in support of the Proposed Consolidation. There was also no objection to the Proposed Consolidation from any creditor at the hearing of the present applications.8Foot Note 8×BYCG’s 6th Affidavit at paras 3.4.1 and 3.4.2. 40 Fourth, the present applications do not prejudice ongoing legal proceedings. This was made clear in para 1(c) of the summonses. 41 Finally, while the Liquidators stated that the eventual compromises or arrangements that result from the implementation of the Proposed Consolidation would “in principle” receive the court’s approval pursuant to ss 144(1)(c) and 144(1)(d) of the IRDA, they also reiterated that they were not seeking such approval in these applications. As such, despite the Liquidators making rather detailed submissions on this matter, I did not see why it was appropriate or necessary for the court to consider the likelihood of such a compromise or arrangement passing muster at this stage. I therefore emphasise that nothing in these grounds should be taken as making any observations on such compromises or arrangements. These applications had nothing to do with the validity of any such compromises or arrangements.",
        "Conclusion": "42 For all of these reasons, I made the directions sought in these applications. Goh YihanJudge of the High Court Chan Ming Onn David, Fong Zhiwei Daryl, Lin Ruizi, Yong Ying Jie Denise and Tan Wei Sze (Shook Lin & Bok LLP) for the applicants;The defendants absent and unrepresented; Toh Yong Xiang (WongPartnership LLP) for the non-party (watching brief)."
