        "In summary the applicant submitted that it was not the form of the scheme which\n\n  mattered in terms of whether the guarantee was discharged but rather whether the scheme of\n\n  arrangement occurred by operation of law. Fine distinctions between schemes were immaterial \n\n  the key issue was the principle expounded inHill v Anderson Meatwhich was of general\n\n  application. I uphold those contentions.": "16 Similar pronouncement was made inButtle v Allan as Official Liquidator of\n\nButtle & Co Sharebrokers Ltd (In Liquidation)[1994] 1 NZLR 396at p 404, where the New\n\nZealand Court of Appeal said:\"We acceptHillscase as being a correct statement of the law in\n\n  New Zealand as well as in Australia. The sanctioning of a scheme of arrangement does not discharge\n\n  the original debt for all purposes any more than does the adjudication in bankruptcy of the debtor\n\n  or the winding up of a debtor company. It does not affect the liability of a guarantor, even\n\n  though that liability is expressed in the form of a guarantee of the original debt.\"17 We now turn to the English authorities. InEx p Jacobs, Re Jacobs(1875) LR 10 Ch App 211, one James Martin was the holder of a bill of exchange which was drawn by a\n\nperson called Sydney Jacobs upon one Samuel Phillips. The bill was dishonoured, and Phillips, being\n\nunable to pay his debts, called a meeting of his creditors, and a composition was agreed upon\n\nbetween him and the requisite number of creditors pursuant to s 125 and 126 of the English\n\nBankruptcy Act 1869. The issue for determination before the court was whether Jacobs liability to\n\nMartin was discharged by virtue of the composition. The court held that the discharge of Phillips\n\nwas by operation of law and that Jacob was not discharged. Mellish LJ said at p 213:There can be no doubt that, if the holder of a bill, by becoming party to a\n\n  deed or arrangement, independently of any bankruptcy Act, agrees to accept a composition from the\n\n  acceptor, he thereby discharges the drawer; but, on the other hand, it is equally clear that if\n\n  the acceptor is discharged from his liability by operation of law by becoming a bankrupt, the\n\n  liability of the drawer to the holder is not thereby affected.18 InRe London Chartered Bank of Australia[1893] 3 Ch 540, Vaughan\n\nWilliams J considered a scheme of arrangement proposed by a bank under s 2 of the Joint Stock\n\nCompanies Arrangement Act 1870 (which, so far as material, is substantially similar to our s 210).\n\nAn objection was made to the scheme on the ground that it did not reserve the right of the creditors\n\nagainst the sureties of the company for the latters debts. The learned judge held that there was\n\nno need to insert such a reservation in the scheme. In considering the terms and the effect of the\n\nscheme, the learned judge said at pp 546  547:The scheme contains no release of the bank or the contributories; it contains\n\n  no covenant not to sue, and it is by operation of law that the scheme becomes effective to relieve\n\n  the company and contributories from further liability than that contemplated or imposed by the\n\n  scheme. The scheme of arrangement under the Act of 1870 is  as I have had occasion to point out\n\n  in several cases  an alternative mode of liquidation which the law allows the statutory\n\n  majority of creditors to substitute for the pending winding-up, whether voluntary or under the\n\n  Court, just as theBankruptcy Act, 1869, allowed the creditors the substituted liquidation\n\n  by arrangement under sect. 125, or composition under sect. 126, of that Act, for a pending\n\n  bankruptcy. The discharge of the bankrupt in such case was statutory and not conventional, and\n\n  therefore by operation of law. Just so here, under the Act of 1870. The discharge of the company\n\n  or contributories under theJoint Stock Companies Arrangement Act, 1870, is by operation of\n\n  law effected by the stay of actions imposed .. It seems to me, then, that the discharge being\n\n  clearly by operation of law consequent upon statutory liquidation, the principles laid down by\n\n  Lord Justice Mellish inIn re Jacobs((1875) LR 10 Ch App 211) apply, and that, therefore,\n\n  there is no need, and it would not be right, to introduce a reservation of rights against sureties\n\n  into the scheme of arrangement.19 In a similar vein was the case ofDane v Mortgage Insurance Corp Ltd[1893] 1 QB 54 decided by the Court of Appeal. There, the defendants by an instrument purported to\n\nbe a policy of insurance guaranteed the plaintiff that they would pay her a certain sum of\n\nmoney, if a certain bank defaulted in making payment on a loan agreement. Subsequently, the bank\n\ndefaulted and proposed a scheme of arrangement with the creditors under the Australian legislation,\n\nand the scheme was approved by the requisite majority of creditors and the court. The plaintiff did\n\nnot assent to the scheme, which however under the legislation was binding on her. She later brought\n\nan action against the defendants under the guarantee. Although the court was undecided as to whether\n\nthe liability of the defendants was in the nature of a suretyship or an insurance contract, it was\n\nunanimous that the defendants were liable notwithstanding the scheme of arrangement. Kay LJ\n\nfollowingRe Jacobs(supra) said at p 63:It was decided inEx parte Jacobs(1875) LR 10 Ch App 211 that a\n\n  resolution for liquidation or composition, though binding on all the creditors, is a discharge of\n\n  the debtor by operation of law, and does not discharge the surety. Assuming that this contract\n\n  was, as contended by the defendants counsel, a mere contract of guarantee or suretyship, it\n\n  seems to me that default did occur within the meaning of that contract, and that therefore a right\n\n  of action vested in the plaintiff to which what occurred afterwards affords no kind of defence.20 InRe Garners Motors, Limited[1937] 1 Ch 594, two companies\n\nSentinel Waggons Works Ltd (Sentinel) and Garners Motors Ltd (Garners Motors) were\n\nunder a joint and several liability to Temple Press Ltd in respect of certain payments. Sentinel\n\nwent into receivership and a scheme of arrangement was proposed by Sentinel to be made with its\n\ncreditors and shareholders under s 153 of the Companies Act 1929 (which was identical in all\n\nmaterial respects with our s 210). The scheme was sanctioned by the court. Pursuant to the scheme of\n\narrangement, Temple Press Ltd accepted a certain payment from Sentinel, which discharged all the\n\nliability of Sentinel. Later, Garners Motors went into liquidation, and Temple Press lodged a\n\nproof of debt for the balance sum owing. The proof was rejected by the liquidators of Garners\n\nMotors. The question was whether the scheme of arrangement of Sentinel discharged the liability of\n\nGarners Motors to Temple Press Ltd. Crossman J held that a statutory scheme did not have this\n\neffect and said, at p 598:It is settled law that accord and satisfaction between a creditor and one of\n\n  several debtors, who are jointly and severally liable to the creditor, discharges the other\n\n  debtors unless it appears from the terms of the agreement or the surrounding circumstances that\n\n  the creditor intended to reserve his rights against them  But in my judgment a discharge of one\n\n  of several joint debtors by operation of law does not discharge the other debtors. In my judgment\n\n  the effect of s 153 of the Companies Act, 1929, is to give to a scheme when sanctioned by the\n\n  Court under the section a statutory operation. The scheme when sanctioned by the Court becomes\n\n  something quite different from a mere agreement signed by the parties. It becomes a statutory\n\n  scheme. In my judgment, therefore, the discharge of Sentinel Waggon Works, Ld., from the debt to\n\n  Temple Press, Ld., which was effected under clause 15 of the scheme sanctioned by the Court on\n\n  March 23, 1936, did not have the effect of discharging Garners Motors, Ld., from its liability\n\n  in respect of the debt. It is settled law that a discharge of one of several judgment-debtors by\n\n  operation of law does not release the other debtors. But in my judgment the effect of s 153 of the\n\n  Companies Act, 1929, is to give a scheme when sanctioned by the Court a statutory operation.Settled law21 On the basis of these authorities, it is settled law that a scheme of\n\narrangement or compromise made between a company and its creditors in relation to its debts and\n\nliabilities, approved by the requisite majority of the creditors and by the court, affects only the\n\nrights of the creditors against the company, and does not affect the rights of the creditors against\n\na third party, such as a guarantor, for the same debts and liabilities of the company. Consequently,\n\nwhere such scheme discharges either in whole or in part the debts owed by the company to its\n\ncreditors, it does not operate as a discharge of the liability of the guarantor for the same debts\n\nor liabilities of the company. However, in all these cases, the schemes in question did not contain\n\nany express term requiring the creditors to extinguish or discharge the liability of a third party,\n\nsuch as a guarantor, for the debts or liabilities of the company concerned. In the instant case, the\n\nscheme contains an express provision to the effect that upon the company, CEL Tractors, observing\n\nand performing their obligations under the scheme, the creditors will release the guarantors from\n\ntheir obligations under the respective guarantees. In this respect, the instant case is\n\ndistinguishable from these cases, which therefore do not really assist in the resolution of the\n\nissue before us.Issues22 It seems to us that in this case there are really two issues for\n\ndetermination. The first is whether it is permissible to incorporate in a scheme of arrangement or\n\ncompromise under s 210 of the Companies Act, as was incorporated in the present scheme under\n\nconsideration, a term to the effect that, upon the company performing its obligations as regards\n\npayments and other things vis--vis the creditors under the scheme, the creditors will release the\n\nguarantors from their obligations under the respective guarantee. The second is whether such a term\n\nis valid and effectual for the purpose.23 On the first question, we can see no reason in principle why a scheme of\n\narrangement or compromise under s 210 of the Companies Act cannot incorporate such a term. No cases\n\nhave been cited to us to say that such a term cannot be embodied in a scheme. After all, a scheme of\n\narrangement or compromise proposed by a company to be made with its creditors or a class of\n\ncreditors under s 210 of the Companies Act is no more than a proposal to vary or modify its\n\nobligations in relation to its debts and liabilities owed to its creditors or a class of creditors\n\non certain terms and conditions. In seeking so to vary or modify its obligations, there is nothing\n\nto prevent the company from proposing, as part of a wider scheme, inter alia, a term to the effect\n\nthat, in consideration of what the company has provided under the scheme, the creditors will, upon\n\nimplementation of the scheme, discharge not only the debts and liabilities of the company but also\n\nthe liabilities of the guarantors for the same debts and liabilities of the company. Whether such a\n\nterm is agreeable to its creditors is a different matter; it all depends on the circumstances of the\n\ncase and what the company has to offer under the scheme as a quid pro quo for the discharge of these\n\nliabilities.24 It is trite law that, where a scheme of arrangement or compromise (containing\n\nsuch a term) is approved by all the creditors of the company, it is binding on the company as well\n\nas its creditors. In such a case, there is no need on the part of the company to invoke s 210 of the\n\nCompanies Act. The scheme is wholly a contractual scheme. Where, as is usually the case, it is not\n\npractical or practicable to secure the unanimous agreement of all the creditors, s 210 is invoked.\n\nAnd when s 210 is invoked, and the scheme is approved by the requisite majority of the creditors and\n\nthe court, the scheme becomes binding on all the creditors or the class of creditors (as the case\n\nmay be). That is provided in s 210(3) of the Act. The binding effect of the scheme is given by the\n\ncourt order approving the scheme. As Street J said inRe Norfolk Island And Byron Bay Whaling Co\n\nLtd(1969) 90 WN (NSW) 351 at 354 with reference to s 181 of the Companies Act 1961 of the State\n\nof New South Wales (which is the equivalent of our s 210), the section is intended to provide a\n\nmachinery (i) for overcoming the impossibility or impracticability of obtaining the individual\n\nconsent of every member of the class intended to be bound thereby, and (ii) for preventing, in\n\nappropriate circumstances, a minority of class members frustrating a beneficial scheme.25 We now turn to another aspect of a scheme of arrangement or compromise under s\n\n210 of the Companies Act. It is permissible in law to incorporate in a scheme an involvement or\n\nparticipation by an outsider, that is, a party not a party to the scheme. Indeed, quite often, a\n\nscheme does provide for such involvement or participation by an outsider. Quite often, a scheme as\n\ndevised provides for a buy out or an injection of cash by an outsider and it has been held\n\nthat such a scheme falls within the purview of that section. InRe A and C Constructions Pty\n\nLimited[1970] SASR 565, the Supreme Court of South Australia held that the court would not\n\nrefuse to approve a scheme under s 181 of the Companies Act 1962-1968 (which was the equivalent of\n\nour s 210) merely because (i) the scheme provided for an outsider to purchase the company structure\n\nin order to obtain a tax benefit, and (ii) that a person other than the company, its members and\n\ncreditors was a party to the scheme. Bray CJ said at p 568:An order of the court under s 181(2) is necessary so that a dissentient,\n\n  non-voting or absentee minority of creditors or members may be bound by the scheme. Otherwise\n\n  everything could be done contractually. The order of the court in the terms of the sub-section is\n\n  made binding only on the creditors or members, or particular class of creditors or members, and on\n\n  the company, or, if the company is being wound up, also on its liquidator and contributories. It\n\n  is, however, in my view, a fallacy to assume that therefore no other person can be a party to the\n\n  scheme. In my view, so long as the scheme can properly be described as a compromise or arrangement\n\n  between a company and its members or creditors or any class of them within the meaning of s\n\n  181(1), it is immaterial that other persons are parties to it, but its binding force on such other\n\n  parties will derive from the scheme as a contract, or from some other contract, and not from the\n\n  order of the court.A similar pronouncement was made by another member of the court, Wells J who said\n\nat p 574:A scheme that includes provisions that may without doubt be said to constitute\n\n  a compromise or arrangement of the kind described by s 181 does not cease to fall within the\n\n  jurisdiction conferred upon the court by that section by reason only of the inclusion within the\n\n  scheme of an outsider  a person not the company, a member or a creditor  but the extent to\n\n  which the stranger will be bound by the scheme will depend on the inherent contractual validity of\n\n  the scheme with respect to the stranger, and not upon any order of the court under s 181\n\n  signifying its approval of the scheme.26 InRe Glendale Land Development Ltd (in liq)[1982] 9 ACLR 171, a\n\nscheme of arrangement proposed by the company under s 315(1) of the Companies (NSW) Code involved a\n\nthird party in the implementation of the scheme. On the application by the company for directions to\n\nconvene a meeting of creditors, McLelland J of the Supreme Court of New South Wales considered\n\nwhether the scheme could contain such a provision involving an outsider. He held that an\n\narrangement between a company and its relevant creditors was not outside the scope of s 315 merely\n\nbecause it was part of a wider scheme involving an outsider or an outsider was a necessary party to\n\nthe implementation of the scheme. The learned judge said at p 173:[A]n arrangement between a company and its relevant creditors or members is not\n\n  outside the scope of such a provision as s 315 merely because it is part of a wider scheme\n\n  involving outsiders, or an outsider is a necessary party to its implementation. This is in any\n\n  event made abundantly clear by the provisions of s 317.In coming to this conclusion, the learned judge followed the decision inRe A\n\nand C Construction Pty Ltd(supra) and adopted those parts of the judgments of Bray CJ and Wells\n\nJ quoted above.27 The scheme before us involves also third parties but in a passive way. Under\n\ncl 4.3 of the scheme, the creditors of CEL Tractors are required, upon the CEL Tractors performing\n\ntheir obligations under the scheme, to release the guarantors from the obligations to pay the debts\n\nand liabilities of the company under the respective guarantees. In our judgment, there is no reason\n\nwhy the scheme may not contain such a provision.28 We now turn to the second question, which is whether such a term is valid and\n\neffectual, bearing in mind that the guarantors are not a party to the scheme. It has been held in a\n\ncouple of Australian cases that even if a scheme contained a term seeking to discharge the rights of\n\nthe creditors against the guarantors, such a scheme would not affect the rights of the creditors\n\nagainst the guarantors for the debt or liability of the company concerned.29 The first isRe Buildmat (Australia) Pty Ltd And The Companies Act(1981) 5 ACLR 689 which is relied upon by Daewoo. A company, Buildmat, had covenanted to pay to the\n\nlandlord of certain premises the rents and other outgoings of the tenant, Piermat. The latter\n\nsubsequently entered into an arrangement with its creditors whereby, among other things, upon\n\ncertain payments being made, Piermat would be under no further liability to its creditors. The\n\nscheme also contained a term to the effect that the creditors would relinquish all their rights\n\nunder the guarantees and indemnities given in respect of Piermats indebtedness. The scheme was\n\napproved by the requisite majority of Piermats creditors and by the court. The landlord\n\nsubsequently petitioned for the winding up of Buildmat relying on the latters failure to meet\n\ntheir obligations to make certain payments due under the lease. Needham J of the Supreme Court of\n\nNew South Wales held that, notwithstanding the express provision in the scheme of arrangement, the\n\nscheme did not discharge the liability of Buildmat. He said at pp 691-692:In my opinion, cl 15 of the lease is not an indemnity: it creates a joint and\n\n  several liability in the lessee and the covenantor  However, it does not seem to me to matter,\n\n  in this case, whether I am right or wrong in that conclusion, because, even if cl 15 constitutes\n\n  an indemnity, the scheme does not effect a discharge of that indemnityIt is, I think, well established by decisions binding on me that the\n\n  contractual relationship existing between the creditors of a company and the company after the\n\n  approval by the court of a scheme of arrangement under s 181 of the Companies Act 1961, is a\n\n  relationship created by the operation of the Act on the order of the court  It follows, as the\n\n  Court of Appeal has held (inHill v Anderson Meat Industries[1972] 2 NSWLR 704) that,\n\n  where a creditors debt has been discharged by the operation of a scheme of arrangement approved\n\n  by the court, the approval of the scheme does not affect the right of a creditor bound by the\n\n  scheme to take proceedings for recovery against a guarantor.30 We would make two observations. First, what the learned judge said is, in our\n\nrespectful view, strictly correct; that was clearly the position as between the creditor and the\n\nguarantor, Buildmat. However, it does not follow that as between the creditor and Piermat such a\n\nterm had no effect and was not binding on the creditor, and that Piermat could not take proceedings\n\nto enforce that term. This particular point was not discussed or mentioned by Needham J in his\n\njudgment. Secondly, the learned judge founded his decision onHill, but the schemes inHilldid not contain such an express term extinguishing the rights of the creditors against the\n\nguarantors. To that extent,Hillis distinguishable fromBuildmat.31The next case isRe Andersens Home Furnishing Co Pty Ltd(1996)\n\n14 ACLC 1,710. There, the directors of a company, Edshar, appointed an administrator under Part 5.3A\n\nof the Corporation Law, and the administrator drew up a deed of arrangement proposed to be made\n\nbetween the company and its creditors. Under the deed the directors were to sell their house and to\n\nuse the proceeds to pay the creditors and upon such payment the creditors were deemed to have\n\nreleased the directors from their guarantees. At a meeting of creditors called to consider the\n\nproposed deed, the motion that the deed be approved and executed was carried with the requisite\n\nmajority. Two of the creditors who were against the deed had guarantees given by the directors of\n\nthe company. One of these two creditors applied to court to terminate the deed on the ground that it\n\nwas unfairly discriminatory against it. Demack J, followingHill v Anderson Meat Industries Ltd(supra), held that the deed did not extinguish the rights of the creditors against the guarantors.\n\nThe learned judge said at p 1,714:Applying that decision here, Lacys [the guarantors] have given a guarantee to\n\n  Andersens that they will meet Edshars debts. If the Deed operates as a discharge of Edshars\n\n  obligations to Andersens, it does so by virtue of s. 444D and not by virtue of any agreement\n\n  between Edshar and Andersens. In those circumstances it does not discharge Lacys obligations to\n\n  Andersens. In the words of s 444D(1), the deed binds all creditors of the company so far as it\n\n  concerns claims arising on or before the day specified in the deed. The claims that are referred\n\n  to are claims against the company, not claims a creditor might make against a person who has\n\n  guaranteed the payment of the debts of the company .Later the learned judge said:However, by this Deed, the creditors meeting has purported to release Lacys\n\n  from personal obligations they have assumed towards Andersens and the landlord. There is no\n\n  statutory authority to do this. There is no common law or equitable basis for doing this.\n\n  Consequently, cl 5.3 is beyond the power of the creditors meeting, unless, of course, the\n\n  creditors who are affected by the clause vote in favour of the execution of the deed. The\n\n  provision, cl 5.3, is unfairly discriminatory against Andersens, which voted against the motion to\n\n  execute the Deed.Here again, we observe that the learned judges decision was founded onHill\n\nv Anderson Meat Industries Ltd. As we have said, the schemes of arrangement inHilldid\n\nnot contain any provision seeking to discharge the rights of the creditors against the guarantors of\n\nthe company concerned. Nor did the learned judge consider the binding effect of the arrangement as\n\nbetween Edshar and it creditors, and in particular whether Edshar could in principle enforce the\n\nterm relating to the discharge of the guarantors.32 True it is that a scheme of arrangement or compromise made between a company\n\nand its creditors under s 210 of the Companies Act binds only the company and the creditors. The\n\nguarantors of the companys debts and liabilities are not a party to the scheme, and hence as\n\nbetween the creditors and the guarantors of the debts and liabilities of the company, the scheme of\n\narrangement by itself, of course, does not affect directly the rights and obligations of these\n\nparties under the guarantees. Consequently, as and when the scheme is approved by the requisite\n\nmajority of the creditors and by the court under s 210, as between the creditors and the guarantors\n\nof the company, the rights and obligations of the parties under the guarantees remain unaffected by\n\nthe scheme. On the other hand, as the scheme is binding on the company and its creditors, there is\n\nno reason in principle why the company cannot in principle enforce the terms of the scheme as\n\nagainst the creditors. It must be borne in mind that the scheme contains reciprocal rights and\n\nobligations of the company and the creditors, and once the company has observed and performed all\n\nits obligations under the scheme, the creditors likewise must observe and perform their obligations\n\nthereunder, and if they fail or refuse to do so, the company is entitled to take proceedings to\n\nenforce their obligations under the scheme.33 It follows therefore that in this case, if CEL Tractors duly perform their\n\nobligations under the scheme vis--vis the creditors, the latter must likewise perform their\n\nobligations thereunder, and if they refuse or fail to do so, e.g. if they take legal proceedings to\n\nenforce the guarantees, CEL Tractors are entitled to seek equitable reliefs in the form of an\n\ninjunction and specific performance against the creditors concerned, because if the creditors seek\n\nto enforce the guarantees, the guarantors will inevitably seek to have a recourse against CEL\n\nTractors for an indemnity. Such a position would entirely negate the provisions of cl 4.3 of the\n\nscheme.34 For completeness, we should consider the decision of the English Court of\n\nAppeal in the case ofJohnson and Anor v Davies and Anor[1998] 2 BCLC 252, which was relied\n\nupon by the judge below and by Mr Coomaraswamy, counsel for CEL Tractors, before us, although in our\n\nview it is not strictly relevant. In that case, the plaintiffs were the sureties of a lease taken in\n\nthe name of their company. Later they sold their shares in the company to the two defendants and a\n\nthird party, Hopkins, and in the sale agreement the defendants and Hopkins agreed to indemnify the\n\nplaintiffs against all claims arising under the lease. The company subsequently went into\n\nreceivership and a claim was made against the plaintiffs which they met. At about that time, Hopkins\n\nentered into a voluntary arrangement with his creditors under Pt VII of the Insolvency Act 1986,\n\nunder which, among other things, subject to certain payments made by Hopkins in a certain manner, he\n\nwould be released from further liability to all his creditors. The plaintiffs were given notice of\n\nthe meeting of the creditors convened for the purpose of approving the arrangement. The arrangement\n\nwas approved. Under the Act, the plaintiffs were deemed to be bound by the arrangement.\n\nSubsequently, the plaintiffs brought proceedings against the defendants seeking to recover the sums\n\nthey had paid under the lease. They applied for summary judgment, and the deputy district judge held\n\nthat the defendants were discharged by the voluntary arrangement entered into between Hopkins and\n\nhis creditors, including the plaintiffs, and accordingly, he dismissed the application. The\n\nplaintiffs appealed to the High Court judge. The judge took the view that the effect of the\n\nvoluntary arrangement entered into by Hopkins under the Insolvency Act 1986 was not such as to\n\nrelease co-debtors, namely, the defendants from their liabilities under indemnity given to the\n\nplaintiffs. He therefore allowed the appeal. The defendants then appealed to the Court of Appeal.\n\nThe Court dismissed the appeal but on different grounds.35 The question in that case was whether the voluntary arrangement made between\n\nHopkins and his creditors under the Insolvency Act 1986 had the effect of releasing the defendants\n\nfrom their joint liability with Hopkins. The provision of the Insolvency Act 1986 applicable to\n\narrangements made by individual persons is s 260, which so far as relevant provides:260.(1) This section has effect where the meeting summoned under section 257\n\n  approves the proposed voluntary arrangement (with or without modifications).(2) The approved arrangement(a) takes effect as if made by the debtor at meeting, and(b) binds every person who in accordance with the rules had notice of, and\n\n    was entitled to vote at, the meeting (whether or not he was present or represented at it) as if\n\n    he were a party to the arrangement...Chadwick LJ, with whom Wade and Kennedy L JJ concurred, held that the arrangement\n\nbeing an voluntary arrangement made under the Insolvency Act 1986, depending on its terms, could\n\nhave the effect of discharging a co-debtor of Hopkins jointly liable for the same debt, but that on\n\nthe terms of the arrangement it could not be construed to have such effect. Accordingly, the\n\ndefendants remained liable to the plaintiffs under the indemnity. The learned judge rejected the\n\ncontention that, even if there is any express term in an arrangement, which would or might otherwise\n\nhave the effect of discharging co-debtors and sureties of the debtor from any further liability,\n\nthat will not be the effect if the arrangement is made under the provisions in Part VIII of the\n\nInsolvency Act 1986. The learned judge took the view that the provisions of the Insolvency Act\n\nregarding voluntary arrangements introduce a statutory hypothesis of consent. As such, an\n\narrangement under the Act is not to be considered `statutory in nature, but were to be treated as\n\nconsensual deeds which would accordingly be capable of releasing co-debtors. He said at p 269-270:There is an important  and, to my mind, crucial  distinction between the\n\n  provisions in Pt VIII of the 1986 Act and those in ss 125 and 126 of the 1869 Act. Under the 1869\n\n  Act the discharge of the debtor took effect by virtue of the statute and the rules made under it:\n\n  seeMegrath v Gray, Gray v Megrath(1874) LR 9 CP 216 at 231 andEx p Jacobs, Re Jacobs(1875) LR 10 Ch App 211 at 213. Under the various Companies Acts, considered in the authorities\n\n  cited, the discharge takes place by virtue of a scheme which becomes operative when it is approved\n\n  by the court. Under Pt VIII of the 1986 Act, the discharge of the debtor depends entirely on the\n\n  terms of the arrangement. One must look at the arrangement, and nothing else, in order to find the\n\n  terms (if any) under which the debtor is discharged. This is emphasised by the words in s 260(2)\n\n  of the 1986 Act:The approved arrangement(b) binds every personas if\n\n  he were a party to the arrangement. Unlike the earlier legislation, s260(2) of the 1986 Act\n\n  does not purport, directly, to impose the arrangement on a dissenting creditor whether or not he\n\n  has agreed to its terms; rather, he is bound by the arrangement as the result of a statutory\n\n  hypothesis. The statutory hypothesis requires him to be treated as if he had consented to the\n\n  arrangement. The consequence, as it seems to me, is that the legislature must be taken to have\n\n  intended that both the question whether the debtor is discharged by the arrangement and the\n\n  question whether the co-debtors and sureties are discharged by the arrangement were to be answered\n\n  by treating the arrangement as consensual; that is to say, by construing its terms as if they were\n\n  the terms of a consensual agreement between the debtor and all those creditors who, under the\n\n  statutory hypothesis, must be treated as being consenting parties.We do not think it is necessary for us to deal with this analysis of Chadwick LJ.\n\nSuffice it to say that his analysis was based on the express wording in s 260 of the Insolvency Act\n\n1986.36 Generally speaking, in approving a scheme under s 210 of the Act, the duty of\n\nthe court is to consider whether the statutory provisions have been complied with, whether the\n\nscheme is fair and reasonable to the creditors as a whole, whether the company and the majority\n\ncreditors are acting bona fide, and whether the minority is being coerced to promote the interest of\n\nthe majority: seeIn re English, Scottish, and Australian Chartered Bank[1893] 3 Ch 385,\n\n408;In re Dorman, Long and Company, Ltd[1934] 1 Ch 635. In our opinion, no question of\n\nunfairness, discrimination or absence of bona fides arises in this case. There is no reason why the\n\nscheme should not be approved. The judge below approved it. We would do so likewise.Conclusion37 For the reasons given above, we accordingly dismiss the appeal with costs. The\n\nsecurity deposit together with the interest, if any, will be released to the respondents or their\n\nsolicitors to account of costs.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeSgd:THEAN L PJudge of AppealSgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealCopyright © Government of Singapore."
