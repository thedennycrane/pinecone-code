        "The facts": "2 The respondent lived with the victim, their eight year old daughter\n\nand his mother-in-law in an HDB flat in Yishun.3 On 1 September 2001, at about 11.10pm, the respondent entered the\n\nvictim’s room with a meat cleaver. While pointing the cleaver at the victim, the\n\nrespondent uttered in Mandarin that he wanted to kill her. The victim, who was in her room\n\nalone, quickly picked up the telephone in the room. When the respondent saw this, he\n\nretreated from the room and went into the kitchen.The victim, fearing for her safety,\n\nthen left the house together with her elderly mother and her daughter to look for the\n\npolice at the void deck of the flat.4 On 2 September 2001, at about 4 pm, the victim left her bedroom and\n\nwent to the living room to get some ointment for a mosquito bite. The victim saw the\n\nrespondent lying on a foldable bed in the living room. The victim’s mother and\n\ndaughter were also in the living room at the material time. As the victim was about to\n\nreturn to her bedroom, the respondent suddenly grabbed her from behind and, in one swift\n\nmotion, coiled and tightened a copper wire, measuring about one metre in length, around\n\nher neck. In that split second, the victim managed to slip her right hand underneath the\n\nwire while simultaneously using her left hand to pull at the wire in a bid to prevent it\n\nfrom further tightening. In the ensuing struggle, the respondent proceeded to pin the\n\nvictim down onto the sofa in the living room, and further tightened the wire around her\n\nneck while verbally threatening to strangle her to death. He refused to loosen his grip on\n\nthe wire even when the victim, who was having difficulty breathing, was gasping for air.\n\nInstead, he tried to pull the victim’s right hand away from underneath the wire, and\n\neven resorted to biting the victim’s right hand in an attempt make her release her\n\ntenacious grip on the wire. As the victim still refused to let go of the wire, the\n\nrespondent proceeded to bite her on her back, near her right shoulder. By this time, the\n\nvictim’s elderly mother and her eight year old daughter intervened and forced the\n\nrespondent to release his grip on the wire. With their help, the victim finally managed to\n\nfree herself from the respondent’s hold.5 The victim then left the house together with her mother and daughter\n\nto lodge a police report. She sought treatment at Tan Tock Seng Hospital on the same day\n\nand the doctor who examined her noted that she suffered the following injuries as a result\n\nof the respondent’s attack:a     abrasions : 4 cm in diametre over anterior\n\n  chest wall and left shoulder;b     two puncture wounds and ‘bite’\n\n  marks, seen over dorsal aspect of right hand;c     five wire marks : linear marks seen over the\n\n  right hand and right side of neck (about 5 cm long);d     lacerations over the lower lips.6 The victim was given the appropriate medical treatment and discharged\n\nwith three days’ medical leave.",
        "The appeal": "7 The prosecution appealed against the sentence imposed on the ground\n\nthat it was manifestly inadequate. They submitted, inter alia, that the district judge had\n\nerred in his assessment of the gravity of the offence.8 Having reviewed the circumstances of the case, I agreed entirely with\n\nthe prosecution’s submissions and found that the district judge had made gross errors\n\nof judgment in passing a sentence that can only be described as hopelessly\n\ndisproportionate to the gravity of the offence. From his written grounds, it would appear\n\nthat the district judge had completely failed to consider many of the aggravating factors\n\nthat were so glaringly present. Instead, he simply glossed over these factors by holding\n\nthat the respondent’s actions were done \"in a fit of anger\", and that the\n\ninjuries sustained by the victim were not \"very serious\" as there were \"no\n\nevidence of permanent disability\". In relation to the offence of criminal\n\nintimidation, he held that the attack was \"not a prolonged one\". In passing the\n\nsentence, he placed a great amount of emphasis on the attack being\n\n\"unprecedented\", the respondent’s lack of antecedents, as well as the\n\nproblems that the respondent was facing at home and at work.",
        "The charge for criminal intimidation under s 506": "9 The punishment for a charge of criminal intimidation is covered by s\n\n506 of the Penal Code. What is apparent from a reading of s 506 is the distinction that is\n\ndrawn between criminal intimidationsimpliciterand an aggravated form of criminal\n\nintimidation that attracts a much harsher punishment. A threat to cause death is\n\nspecifically contemplated by the section to fall within the latter category. Such a threat\n\nwhen made in all seriousness by someone who is not clearly incapable of carrying out the\n\nthreat is something that should never be taken lightly. This is particularly so when a\n\nweapon is used by the accused as part of the threat since the presence of a weapon serves\n\nnot only to make the threat more menacing, but also goes towards proving the maker’s\n\nintent to cause alarm to his victim. The seriousness of the present offence was further\n\naggravated by the fact that the respondent had chosen to attack the victim within the\n\nconfines her room. This would have had the intended effect of causing the victim greater\n\nalarm as she was trapped in the room with no means of escaping. That the victim feared for\n\nher safety was evinced by her leaving the house shortly after the incident to call for the\n\npolice at the void deck of her flat.10 InRamanathan Yogendran v PP[1995] 2 SLR 563, I stated that\n\nin considering whether the substantive offence of criminal intimidation has been\n\nestablished, it should be shown that the victim had some objective basis to apprehend\n\nalarm, even if she was never alarmed. However this does notipso factomean that a\n\nvictim’s fear is irrelevant. It is a factor that should be borne in mind by a\n\nsentencing judge when meting out the appropriate sentence upon the accused’s\n\nconviction. As I have already alluded to above, the victim was not only alarmed by the\n\nrespondent’s threat but had feared for her safety. This is clearly an aggravating\n\nfactor that goes towards the seriousness of the offence.11 In sentencing the respondent, I was also mindful of the sentencing\n\ntariffs set by previous cases involving criminal intimidation. The most recent case was my\n\ndecision inPP v N[1999] 4 SLR 619. In that case, I sentenced the accused, who had\n\nthreatened to kill his estranged wife over the telephone, to one year’s imprisonment.\n\nThere is no doubt that the threat to kill in the present case was a more serious one. It\n\nbears repeating that the respondent had deliberately carried out his threat to kill with\n\nthe use of a weapon and within striking distance of the victim. Furthermore, the fourth\n\ncharge that was to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, related to\n\nthe respondent’s attempt to strangle the victim with his hands some 10 minutes before\n\nhe made the threat to kill her. All these aggravating factors, which the district judge\n\nhad omitted to refer to in his written grounds, far outweighed the fact that the threat\n\nwas not a \"prolonged\" one and, clearly require the court to impose a\n\nproportionately higher sentence.",
        "The charges for voluntarily causing hurt under s 323": "12 The respondent’s acts relating to his two charges for\n\nvoluntarily causing hurt were violent and vicious. They clearly showed that his acts where\n\nnot, as the district judge so naively believed, done \"in a fit of anger\". On the\n\ncontrary, there was no evidence that the attack was provoked. In fact, the evidence would\n\nseem to suggest that the attack involved some degree of premeditation. How else could one\n\nexplain why the respondent, whom the victim observed to be lying on a foldable bed just\n\nseconds before she was attacked, had a one metre long copper wire within his reach?13 It also seemed irrelevant to me in the context of the present case\n\nthat the injuries sustained by the victim were \"not very serious\". The only\n\nreason why her injuries were not more serious, or that she is even alive today, was\n\nbecause she was quick enough to slip her hand underneath the wire to prevent it from\n\ntightening around her neck, and because of the intervention of her mother and her\n\ndaughter.14 What the injuries did in fact show was the degree of force which the\n\nrespondent used on the victim and his corresponding intention to cause the victim serious\n\ninjury. The five wire marks on her neck and right hand indicated that the respondent had\n\nused a considerable amount of force in tightening the wire around her neck. The two\n\npuncture wounds and the ‘bite’ marks on the victim’s right hand revealed\n\nthe respondent’s resolve to force her to release her right hand from under the wire.\n\nThe respondent’s intention to cause the victim serious injury was further shown by\n\nhis verbal threat to strangle her to death while tightening the wire around her neck.15 Given the aggravating circumstances of this case, I had no qualms\n\nabout imposing the maximum possible sentence of one year’s imprisonment for both the\n\nrespondent’s charges under s 323. Had the prosecution not been so kind as to amend\n\nthe respondent’s original charge relating to the incident of strangulation using a\n\ncopper wire from a s 324 offence (voluntarily causing hurt using a dangerous weapon) which\n\ncarries a maximum term of imprisonment of five years, to a s 323 offence, I would in all\n\nprobability have imposed a much higher sentence.16 While it may be true that this was the respondent’s first\n\nattack on his wife, the fact remained that he did attack his wife in a particularly\n\nviolent manner. Only the day before, he had threatened to kill her while brandishing a\n\ncleaver in her face. Barely 24 hours had passed before he grabbed his wife and, this time\n\nround, threatened to kill her while tightening a wire around her neck. He did not cease\n\nhis hold on her on his own accord but had to be overpowered. Furthermore, one should not\n\nforget that this attack was carried out in front of his eight year old daughter who had to\n\nwitness this violent attack on her mother by her own father.17 Violent acts such as these are particularly heinous when they are\n\ncommitted within the confines of a familial relationship as they constitute an abuse of\n\nthe bonds of trust and interdependency that exist between family members. More often than\n\nnot, the effects of such violence within the family fall most harshly upon the children\n\nwho, while they may not be the direct recipients of the violence, will nevertheless carry\n\nthe scars of these acts of brutality. In this regard, I was mindful of the need to deter\n\nanyone else who might resort to such violence, especially in view of the deplorable\n\nincrease in the number of cases involving family violence.",
        "Conclusion": "18 Based on the above conclusions, I allowed the appeal and enhanced\n\nthe respondent’s sentence in respect of his charge of criminal intimidation from two\n\nmonths to two years, and the sentence relating to his charge of voluntarily causing hurt\n\nby using a copper wire to strangle the victim from two months to one year, and the\n\nsentence relating to the second charge of voluntarily causing hurt by biting the victim on\n\nback and right hand from one month to one year. Pursuant to s 18 of the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode (Cap 68), I ordered the sentences on the two charges of criminal intimidation and\n\nstrangulation to run consecutively, making a total sentence of three years’\n\nimprisonment.",
