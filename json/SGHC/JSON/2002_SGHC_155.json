        "Whether the respondent should have seen the deceased": "12 The prosecution’s argument under this head was that the\n\nsurrounding circumstances were such that the deceased should have been seen by anyone who\n\nkept a proper lookout. Since the respondent did not see the deceased until the deceased\n\nwas three metres away, it followed that the respondent had not in fact performed a check\n\nas he claimed to have done. Two issues were hence raised in relation to this contention:\n\nwhether the deceased was visible when the respondent carried out a check for pedestrians\n\nwhen he was 15 metres away from the pedestrian crossing; and whether the respondent had in\n\nfact performed the check as he said that he did.13 Having looked at the evidence, I was not convinced by the\n\nprosecution’s argument that the deceased should have been visible from 15 metres\n\naway. It is trite law that that an appellate court will be slow to disturb the findings of\n\na lower court unless they are clearly reached against the weight of evidence –Lim\n\nAh Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713, applied inPP v Tubbs Julia Elizabeth[2001] 4 SLR 75, and I was of the view that the trial judge’s findings on this issue were not\n\nin error. The prevailing weather conditions at the time of the accident, the poor lighting\n\nand the shrubs planted by the roadside would all have affected the respondent’s\n\nability to detect pedestrians.14 The physical attributes of the deceased would have made his\n\ndetection even more difficult, as more than half of his body would have been concealed by\n\nthe shrubs, and the photographic evidence showed that the deceased was of dark-complexion\n\nand dressed in dark clothing. I also noted that there had been some uncertainty in the\n\ncourt below as to whether the deceased had been carrying a black umbrella when he was\n\nstruck by the respondent’s motorcycle. The prosecution argued that, if the deceased\n\nhad been carrying a black umbrella, that would have made him all the more detectable, but\n\nI was of the contrary view. I felt that, if the deceased had indeed been carrying a black\n\numbrella, that would have served to further conceal him from the respondent’s view.15 In rejecting the prosecution’s argument that the deceased was\n\nvisible from 15 metres away, I was also conscious of the fact that the prosecution had\n\nbeen unable to adduce any evidence as to the maximum distance from which the respondent,\n\nunder the prevailing weather and light conditions, ought to have been able to see the\n\ndeceased. The photographs of the accident scene which had been adduced in the court below\n\nwere of no help, as SSSgt Zainuddin had conceded that the photographs had been taken with\n\na powerful flash. I considered the absence of such evidence to be a major obstacle towards\n\nproof of the prosecution’s contention that the respondent should have been able to\n\nsee the deceased much earlier than when he actually did.16 Having rejected the prosecution’s first proposition, namely\n\nthat the respondent ought to have detected the deceased much earlier, it followed that\n\nthere was no basis from which it could be inferred that the respondent had not actually\n\ncarried out the pedestrian check the way he said he did. I would in any event have been\n\nextremely reluctant to accept such an inference. The prosecution had proceeded in the\n\ncourt below on the basis that the respondent had been negligent since he failed to spot\n\nthe deceased until the deceased was three metres away. The issue of whether the respondent\n\nhad or had not checked the right side of the road for pedestrians had not arisen at all,\n\nsince the prosecution did not challenge the respondent’s evidence that he had indeed\n\ncarried out a check.17 The rule inBrowne v Dunn[1893] 6 R 67 states that any\n\nmatter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness\n\nmust normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the\n\ncontradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the\n\nevidence-in-chief. Although I said inLiza bte Ismail v Public Prosecutor[1997] 2 SLR 454that the rule inBrowne v Dunnis not an inflexible rule, I was of the\n\nopinion that in the circumstances of the present case, it would have been extremely unfair\n\nto the respondent to accept such an argument.18 It was for this same reason that I was disinclined to consider the\n\neffect of white railings located at the right side of the road (which were intended to\n\nchannel pedestrians) on the detectability of the deceased. The railings had not been\n\nbrought up in the court below, and the respondent had not been questioned on the effect,\n\nif any, that they had on his perception, or whether he could even have seen them from 15\n\nmetres away. In such circumstances, it would have been extremely inappropriate for me to\n\nhave taken the railings into account when considering the issue of the deceased’s\n\nvisibility.",
        "Whether the respondent had kept a proper lookout": "19 Related to the foregoing was the prosecution’s contention that\n\nthe accident had occurred because the respondent had not kept a proper lookout. Much\n\nreliance was placed uponPublic Prosecutor v Er Wee Kok(unreported), where the\n\naccused was convicted under s 304A for causing the death of a pedestrian. I was also\n\nreferred toPublic Prosecutor v Teo Lian Seng[1996] 1 SLR 19, in which I had\n\ncommented that on normal roads, there was a need to be alert at all times to the\n\npossibility of persons crossing the road indiscriminately.20 With respect, I did not find the two cases cited to me to be\n\nhelpful. InEr Wee Kok, the deceased had checked for vehicles before he started to\n\ncross the road, and the road had actually been clear when he began to make his way across.\n\nThe accused was also observed to be travelling quite fast, such that after the impact, the\n\ndeceased was thrown up into the air. In light of the trial judge’s finding that the\n\ndeceased had not dashed across the road, as claimed by the accused, the trial judge was\n\n\"driven to the inescapable conclusion\" that the accused had not seen the\n\ndeceased because he was not keeping a proper lookout. The finding was as such closely\n\nrelated to the facts of the case, and given the very different facts in the present case,\n\nI did not findEr Wee Kokto be relevant to the present inquiry. Certainly, I was\n\nof the view that the many factors at play in the present case (as already discussed in the\n\npreceding section) militated against an \"inescapable conclusion\" that the\n\nrespondent had not been keeping a proper lookout.21 I also did not findTeo Lian Sengto be of particular help,\n\nas it was to my mind clear that in the present case, the respondent was in fact alert to\n\nthe possibility of the deceased crossing the road indiscriminately, and had in fact taken\n\nprecautions in order to ward off that eventuality. For example, apart from carrying out\n\ntwo pedestrian checks, the respondent had also slowed down his speed from about 40 or 50\n\nkm/h to 30 km/h as he approached the pedestrian crossing in question. Further, although\n\nthe prosecution also referred me to public policy on the protection of pedestrians at\n\nsignalised crossings, as exemplified by Rules 5 and 7 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian\n\nCrossing) Rules, I took the view that such public policy had not been compromised by the\n\nrespondent’s behaviour in approaching the fateful crossing.",
        "Whether the respondent had behaved prudently": "22 The third contention made by the prosecution before me was that the\n\nrespondent had not behaved prudently as he had persisted in riding on when it was his\n\nevidence that the rain was affecting his vision. The prosecution also took issue with the\n\nrespondent’s moving into the right-most lane when such lane is meant only for\n\novertaking.23 I did not agree with either of the prosecution’s contentions\n\nunder this head. With regard to the first contention, the rain at the time of the accident\n\nwas not heavy, the respondent having testified that, while his T-shirt had water droplets\n\non it, it was not drenched. The respondent had also taken precautions to counteract the\n\neffect of the rain, namely to wipe his visor at every given opportunity, and had also\n\ntestified that, after he sought shelter by riding under the overhang of the MRT track, his\n\nvision improved. Under such circumstances, I was of the opinion that it was not imprudent\n\nof the respondent to continue riding. Indeed, given the light rain conditions at the time\n\nof the accident, if I accepted the prosecution’s submission on this issue, it would\n\nmean that all motorcyclists would be obliged to stop riding once rain progressed beyond a\n\nmere drizzle, and I considered such a proposition to be completely untenable.24 As for whether the respondent had been imprudent in choosing to ride\n\nin the overtaking lane, while it was clear that such action was in violation of traffic\n\nrules, I did not see how such a violation could be said to bear a direct relation to the\n\naccident that subsequently happened. The accident did not occur because the respondent\n\nchose to ride in the overtaking lane, but because he did not have the opportunity to see\n\nthe deceased until it was too late. Riding in the overtaking lane, while certainly not to\n\nbe encouraged, in fact gave the respondent a better opportunity to see the deceased as his\n\nvision improved once he made the change in lanes. The respondent nevertheless failed to\n\nsee the deceased, a failure more properly attributable to the confluence of prevailing\n\nconditions at the time. As such, I was of the opinion that such imprudence bore no\n\nrelation to the issue of the respondent’s negligence.",
        "Alternative conviction under s 65, Road Traffic Act": "25Turning finally to the prosecution’s request for an\n\nalternative conviction under s 65 of the Road Traffic Act, it seemed to me that s 65 might\n\nhave been a more appropriate section for the present case to have been brought under. I\n\ndid not feel that the nature of the accident warranted the harsh criminal sanctions of a\n\ncharge under s 304A. Having said that, I was unwilling to grant an amendment to the charge\n\nat such a late stage, given both that the entire trial in the court below had proceeded on\n\nthe basis of s 304A, as well my view that the respondent’s alleged culpability under\n\ns 65 was at best speculative in light of the circumstances of the present case.Conclusion26 For the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the appeal against the\n\nrespondent’s acquittal.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
