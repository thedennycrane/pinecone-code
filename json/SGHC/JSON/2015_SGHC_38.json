        "Introduction": "1       Suit 888 of 2012 was started by the Writ of\n                    Summons filed on 16 October 2012, and involved a claim by the Plaintiffs against\n                    the Defendants for defamation and/or malicious falsehood, and a counterclaim by\n                    the Defendants against the Plaintiffs for copyright infringement and passing\n                    off. 2       After hearing the parties and considering their\n                    arguments, I find that the Plaintiffs’ action in defamation succeeds in\n                    part. The Defendants’ counterclaim for copyright infringement succeeds.\n                    The Defendants’ counterclaim for passing off fails.",
        "The Facts": "3       There were a large number of factual disputes\n                    and issues which the parties raised. After introducing the parties, I set out a\n                    brief summary of the events leading up to the dispute first, and only later\n                    discuss my specific findings and further details where relevant to the legal\n                    issues before the Court.",
        "The Parties": "4       Golden Season Pte Ltd (“the First\n                    Plaintiff” or “Golden Season”) is a company incorporated in\n                    1982 specialising in military and humanitarian relief products. These include\n                    ready meals, rescue and medical equipment and military battery assemblies.\n                    Designer.SG Pte Ltd (“the Second Plaintiff”) is a company\n                    specialising in contemporary home décor products. Ling Yen Wu (“the Third\n                    Plaintiff” or “Tedric”) is the sales director of the First\n                    Plaintiff and the design director of the Second Plaintiff (the plaintiffs\n                    collectively referred to as “the Plaintiffs”). 5       Whilst Golden Season is in the business of\n                    providing (selling) military and humanitarian relief products to organisations\n                    including non-governmental organisations (“NGO”) such as Mercy\n                    Relief, it is also apparent that they are active in various charitable causes.\n                    This includes donating relief products and providing services during disasters,\n                    for example, during the Szechuan Earthquake in 2007. Mercy Relief was not just a\n                    “customer” of Golden Season: it was also an NGO with whom Golden\n                    Season worked with on charitable causes connected with disaster relief. This\n                    included help with fund raising. 6       Kairos Singapore Holdings Pte Ltd (“the\n                    First Defendant” or “Kairos”) was incorporated in July 2010\n                    and provides inflatable boats, marine products and yacht charter services. The\n                    inflatable boats were suitable for activities such as fishing as well as for use\n                    in flood disaster relief work. Roy Soeigiarto (“the Second\n                    Defendant” or “Roy”) is the director of the First Defendant\n                    (the defendants collectively referred to as “the\n                    Defendants”).",
        "Events leading to the dispute": "7       This dispute was set against the backdrop of the\n                    2011 monsoon season which caused severe and prolonged flooding in Thailand. This\n                    resulted in an urgent need for rescue equipment including inflatable boats and\n                    related gear to assist the disaster relief effort. The First Order and donation to Mercy Relief 8       On 12 October 2011, Tedric contacted Roy\n                    (through a message on an internet site) expressing his interest to purchase\n                    inflatable boats and other suitable equipment for donation purposes in aid of\n                    the floods in Thailand. For convenience, the message is set out\n                        below:[note: 1] Hello, our company is intending to donate inflatable boats for the recent\n                        floods in Thailand. May i [sic] know what you\n                        have in stock for supply? We would also appreciate if you are able to quote\n                        your best prices as this is intended for disaster relief. 9       It would appear that Tedric had initially made\n                    the purchase representing the Second Plaintiff, but later decided that it would\n                    be the First Plaintiff who would be making the purchase. In any case, it is not\n                    disputed that the purpose of the boats (ie, for\n                    use in the Thailand floods) was made known to the Defendants. After some\n                    correspondence, Tedric placed an order on 13 October 2011 for 16 inflatable\n                    boats (comprising 10 KB 430 boats and 6 KB 528XL boats) and two outboard motors\n                    (comprising one 5.8hp motor and one 10hp motor) (“the First\n                        Order”)[note: 2].\n                    Golden Season paid S$ 23,844 to Kairos for the first order. Along with the first\n                    order, Roy also donated two additional KB 430 boats, one used generator and two\n                    used chainsaws (“the Kairos Donated Items”). 10     There were two other purchases of boats from\n                    the Defendants, which will be elaborated on later, but in total, the Plaintiffs\n                    would donate 18 inflatable boats (not including the two boats that the\n                    Defendants donated) and 4 motors to Mercy Relief. 11     The Kairos Donated Items were also passed on\n                    to Mercy Relief. Mercy Relief later acknowledged these donations in a letter\n                    dated 21 October 2011 addressed to Tedric and the First Plaintiff (“the\n                    Acknowledgement Letter”). It is not disputed that the Acknowledgement\n                    Letter was not made known to the Defendants until sometime later. As will be\n                    seen, this was the cause of much unhappiness. 12     The inflatable boats stocked and sold by\n                    Kairos were sourced from a Chinese Original Equipment Manufacturer\n                    (“OEM”). The boats were sold by Kairos under the Kairos Mark\n                    comprising the name “Kairos Inflatable” set out within a fish\n                    symbol. The term “Inflatable Sampans” was also used in marketing\n                    the boats. The meeting at the Plaintiffs’ office and the Exclusive\n                Reseller Agreement 13     The parties continued to correspond with each\n                    other primarily through email. The contents of these emails generally entailed\n                    discussions of prices and features of the various boat models that the\n                    Defendants offered. 14     In the midst of such discussions, a meeting\n                    between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants was arranged. While parties are not\n                    certain at which date this meeting occurred, it is clear that it occurred before\n                    28 October 2011, the day a training session on how to operate the Kairos boats\n                    was held (see below at [20]). 15     During this meeting, the Plaintiffs allege\n                    that they entered into an agreement with the Defendants, whereby the Plaintiffs\n                    would become theexclusivereseller of the\n                    Defendants’ boats, outboard motors and electrical pumps (at least to\n                    humanitarian organisations) (the “Exclusive Reseller Agreement”).\n                    It is also during this meeting that the Plaintiffs allege that the Defendants\n                    had given the Plaintiffs permission to use photos of the boats owned by the\n                    Defendants, and even allowed the Plaintiffs to remove the logo of the Defendants\n                    on such photos so that the Plaintiffs could market the goods as their own.\n                    Furthermore, the Plaintiffs also claim that the Defendants agreed to remove\n                    their prices from the Internet and not to publish their prices\n                anymore. 16     Clearly, what was agreed upon during this\n                    meeting is an issue of dispute between the parties. This will be especially\n                    relevant for the purposes of the Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright\n                    infringement and passing off. The Second and Third Order 17     Tedric later placed a second order on 27\n                    October 2011 for two KB 528XL boats, one 5.8HP motor, and one 10 HP motor\n                    (“the Second Order”)[note: 3]. Finally, on 31 October 2011, Tedric\n                    made a final order of ten more inflatable boats (comprising eight KS 320 boats\n                    and two KS 330 boats) (“the Third Order”)[note: 4]. Including the\n                    first order, Tedric purchased 28 boats and four motors from the Defendants in\n                    total: (a)     10 KB 430 boats (all during the\n                        First Order); (b)     8\n                        KB 528XL boats (six during the First order and two during the Second\n                        order); (c)     8 KS\n                        320 boats (all during the Third Order); (d)     2 KS 330 boats (all during theThirdOrder); (e)     2 5.8hp motors (one during the First Order and another\n                        during the Second Order); and (f)     2 10hp motors (one during the First Order and another\n                        during the Second Order). 18     Although the Plaintiffs eventually purchased a\n                    total of 28 boats from the Defendants, only 18 of these were donated to Mercy\n                    Relief as mentioned above. According to the Plaintiffs, the remaining boats were\n                    “earmarked for [Mercy Relief]’s future missions and were\n                        warehoused”[note: 5]by\n                    the Plaintiffs. The Defendants claim that they were unaware of this, and were\n                    under the impression thatallthe boats would\n                    immediately be deployed in the Thailand floods. 19     Up to this point, there is also dispute as to\n                    whether discounts were offered and provided by Roy, and if they were, the reason\n                    why these discounts were offered. What is also in dispute is whether Roy knew of\n                    the existence of Mercy Relief and that the boats were intended for use by Mercy\n                    Relief (as opposed to simply for flood relief work)before28 October 2011. This will be dealt with\n                later. The training session on 28 October 2011 20     On 28 October 2011, the Defendants carried out\n                    a training session to demonstrate how to operate the Defendants’ boats and\n                    other equipment. This training session was arranged by the Plaintiffs. However,\n                    it was attended by Mr Francis Lee (“Francis”), previously the\n                    Strategic and Partnership Director of Mercy Relief. During this training\n                    session, Francis took the following items from the Defendants: (a)     1 portable electric pump GP80DT\n                        (“the electric pump”); (b)     1 bale of rope of 100 metres length (“the\n                        rope”); and (c)     4 units of LED waterproof blinker lights (“the LED blinker\n                        lights”). 21     According to the Defendants, it was agreed\n                    that Francis would be buying the rope “through Golden Season”.\n                    This would mean that Mercy Relief would pay Golden Season, and after which,\n                    Golden Season would pay the Defendants for the price of the rope. For the\n                    remaining two items, it is in dispute as to whether or not the items were on\n                    loan to Mercy Relief, or whether the same payment arrangements as the rope had\n                    been agreed upon. Whatever it is, the Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs never\n                    paid them for any of the above items. The chain of emails after the training session 22     After the training session, Roy sent the\n                    Plaintiffs an invoice on 31 October 2011 billing the Plaintiffs for the electric\n                    pump, the rope and the LED blinker lights. Roy followed up with an email dated 1\n                    November 2011 mentioning that Francis had taken the electric pump to\n                        Thailand.[note: 6] 23     On 2 November 2011, a heated chain of emails\n                    was exchanged between Roy and Tedric.[note: 7]The main point Tedric wanted to convey\n                    in these emails was that the Defendants should, as far as possible, not be in\n                    direct communication with the Plaintiffs’ clients. Tedric was also worried\n                    that the Defendant had disclosed the prices of certain items to Mercy Relief\n                    during the training session. This was the start of the breakdown of the\n                    relationship between the parties. The sale to Singapore Red Cross 24     On 8 November 2011, the Singapore Red Cross\n                    (“SRC”) issued a press release announcing that it was donating\n                    boats to Thailand as well. The Plaintiffs thus became aware that the Defendants\n                    had sold their boats directly to the SRC as there were photos with boats bearing\n                    the Defendants’ logo. The Plaintiffs were unhappy that the Defendants had\n                    bypassed them to sell to the SRC direct and thereafter instructed one Mr Kenny\n                    Ng (“Kenny”), the purchasing manager of Golden Season, to source\n                    for alternative suppliers of inflatable boats and motors. Amongst the suppliers\n                    that Kenny found was Rongcheng Bestband Industry Co Ltd, Shandong,\n                    People’s Republic China (“Rongcheng”). As it turned out,\n                    Rongcheng was also the Defendants’ inflatable boat supplier. 25     It was during this period when the Plaintiffs\n                    started to distribute brochures to advertise the sales of “Golden\n                    Season” boats. According to the Defendants, the pictures used in these\n                    brochures are unauthorised reproductions of photos owned by the Defendants and\n                    contained photos of the Defendants’ boats with the Defendants’ logo\n                    removed. This forms the basis of the Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright\n                    infringement and passing off. 26     On 22 November 2011, Roy wrote three emails.\n                    The first at 9.55am was an email to the Defendants’ suppliers, where Roy\n                    warned his suppliers that there was a “reseller” that was trying\n                    to bypass the Defendants and were going straight to the Defendants’\n                    clients and suppliers. This email included the text and body of an email that\n                    Kenny had sent to a supplier when he was sourcing for alternative suppliers, and\n                    clearly identified Golden Season. The second email at 10.56am was sent to\n                    Christopher Chua (“Chua”), Secretary-General of the SRC. This\n                    second email contained the first email with a short explanation that Roy was\n                    trying to “set things right”. The third email sent at 6.47pm was a\n                    relatively cordial email addressed to Tedric, where Roy tried to re-affirm the\n                    working relationship between the parties. Roy also offered that an agreement\n                    could be signed where parties should not sell to each other’s clients.\n                    Tedric did not reply to this email. 27     Chua later offered to mediate the matter\n                    between the parties, and sent an email to Tedric on 23 November 2011. In the\n                    exchange of emails on the same day[note: 8], Chua also clarified that it was him\n                    who approached the Defendants for boats for Thailand. He had found the\n                    Defendants by conducting a search on the internet. The Plaintiffs sought a\n                    number of clarifications as to how the Defendants had acted in the sale to the\n                    SRC, including whether the Defendants had asserted that they owned any\n                    intellectual property over the boats and that they could not be purchased from\n                    the Plaintiffs. 28     On 24 November 2011, Tedric sent a text\n                    message to Roy asking him how long he had been doing business with the SRC. Roy\n                    did not reply to this text message. On 25 November 2011, Roy sent an email to\n                    the SRC relating the dispute between the Defendants and the Plaintiffs which\n                    included the following: (a)     that the Plaintiffs had pressed the\n                        Defendants to give details on the business relationship between the\n                        Defendants and the SRC; (b)     that the Defendants never gave the Plaintiffs permission\n                        to use the Defendants’ photos for the Plaintiffs’ brochures, and\n                        that the Plaintiffs were using “other people’s product to\n                        pose” as their own; and (c)     that the Plaintiffs had purchased the Defendants’\n                        boats only to resell them to Mercy Relief at “an undisclosed\n                        amount”. The emails to Mercy Relief 29     On 28 November 2011, the Defendants wrote to\n                    Mercy Relief, and received an auto-reply from Mercy Relief. The contents of this\n                    email are not known. 30     On 29 November 2011, the Defendants wrote to\n                    the Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) of Mercy Relief seeking an\n                    acknowledgment of the Donated Kairos Items, as well as the discounts that the\n                    Defendants had given the Plaintiffs, claiming that this was necessary for\n                    “stock audit, tax and accounting purposes”.[note: 9]It would appear\n                    that the Defendants never received a response to this letter until sometime\n                    during mid-December 2011. In any case, the evidence shows that on 7 December\n                    2011, the Defendants sent another email to Mercy Relief, and in turn, received a\n                    further auto-reply. 31     It was after this that the Defendants started\n                    on what the Plaintiffs call the Defendants’ “defamation\n                    campaign”.",
        "An overview of the defamatory articles": "32     The following is a brief summary of what the\n                    Plaintiffs assert are defamatory of them: (a)     two Facebook posts posted by Roy on\n                        10 December 2011; (b)     eight emails sent to various recipients, including Mercy Relief, the\n                        SRC and their officers, sent in the period between 13 December 2011 and 23\n                        February 2011; and (c)     a phone text message sent to Francis. 33     As an action in defamation is essentially\n                    fact-centric, it is important to understand the context in which this dispute\n                    arises. It is clear from the above outline that, at the very least, there was\n                    some miscommunication and unhappiness in how parties had appeared to have acted\n                    in their business relationship. The Plaintiffs were unhappy that the Defendants\n                    seemed to have bypassed them and contacted their clients (ie, SRC) while the 2ndDefendant\n                    appeared to be unhappy with the fact that his donations might have gone\n                    unnoticed by Mercy Relief as they had not replied to him. This is the brief\n                    background against which the alleged defamatory articles came about. In general,\n                    the two Facebook posts were posts by Roy on his personal and business page\n                    commenting on the spate of events that had occurred, and the eight emails were\n                    correspondences with authorities whom the Defendants thought were relevant to\n                    the dispute. I elaborate on this in the later paragraphs.",
        "Issues before this court": "34     The legal issues before this court are: (a)     For the Plaintiffs’ action in\n                        defamation - (i)       whether the articles are\n                            defamatory of the Plaintiffs; (ii)       if they are, whether any defences are\n                            applicable; and (iii)       if applicable, the quantum of damages to be\n                            awarded. (b)     For the Defendants’ counterclaim - (i)       whether the Plaintiffs had\n                            infringed on the copyright belonging to the Defendants;\n                        and (ii)       whether the Plaintiffs were liable in the tort of passing off (inverse\n                            passing off).",
        "The applicable law – Defamation": "35     The law of defamation is relatively\n                    well-settled and I set out the general principles applicable in this case. The\n                    tort of defamation is concerned with protecting a person’s reputation,\n                    namely, what other people think of him. The classic elements to establish the\n                    tort of defamation are that there must be: (a)     a statement bearing a defamatory\n                        meaning; (b)     publication to a third party; and (c)     reference made to the plaintiff. 36     A statement is considered to be defamatory if\n                    it: (a)     lowers the plaintiff in the\n                        estimation of right-thinking members of society\n                    generally; (b)     causes\n                        the plaintiff to be shunned or avoided; or (c)     exposes the plaintiff to hatred, contempt or\n                        ridicule. See Gary Chan Kok Yew & Lee Pey Woan,The\n                        Law of Torts in Singapore(Academy Publishing, 2011) (\"The Law of Torts in Singapore\") at para\n                12.014. 37     Whether a statement is defamatory is generally\n                    determined based on the construction of the natural and ordinary meaning of the\n                    words used. As summarised by the Court of Appeal inChan\n                        Cheng Wah Bernard and others v Koh Sin Chong Freddie and another\n                        appeal[2012] 1 SLR 506 (\"Chan Cheng\n                        Wah\") at [18], the following guiding principles apply: (a)     the natural and ordinary meaning of\n                        a word is that which is conveyed to an ordinary reasonable\n                    person; (b)     as the test\n                        is objective, the meaning which the defendant intended to convey is\n                        irrelevant; (c)     the\n                        ordinary reasonable reader is not avid for scandal but can read between the\n                        lines and draw inferences; (d)     where there are a number of possible interpretations,\n                        some of which may be non-defamatory, such a reader will not seize on only\n                        the defamatory one; (e)     the ordinary reasonable reader is treated as having read the\n                        publication as a whole in determining its meaning, thus “the bane and\n                        the antidote must be taken together”; and (f)     the ordinary reasonable reader will\n                        take note of the circumstances and manner of the\n                publication. 38     Apart from establishing that the statement is\n                    defamatory, it must also be shown that it is the plaintiff who has been defamed\n                    by the publication of the statement. There is no need for the plaintiff to be\n                    named, but it must be shown that the words would be understood by ordinary\n                    people to refer to the plaintiff. The act of publication and reference to the\n                    plaintiff are key elements of the tort. 39     Once the above are established, the defendant\n                    will be liable for defamation unless he can rely on defences such as\n                    justification, qualified privilege or fair comment. I further elaborate on the\n                    relevant legal principles specific to each article later on when\n                    necessary.",
        "Are the elements of the tort of defamation made out?": "",
        "The Facebook posts": "162    As I have found above, the First Facebook\n                    Post does not adequately refer to the Plaintiffs. This is a requirement under\n                    both the tort of malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the DA. Although this is not\n                    explicitly mentioned under s 6(1) of the DA, the words “calculated to\n                    cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff” have been interpreted by the\n                    Singapore High Court inDHKW Marketing v Nature's Farm Pte\n                        Ltd[1998] 3 SLR(R) 774 at [39] to mean \"likely to produce the\n                    result\" (see alsoGatleyat para 21.13). This was\n                    approved by the Court of Appeal inSukamto Siaat\n                    [112], who went on to observe that a similar interpretation was adopted by the\n                    Supreme Court of New Zealand inCustomglass Boats Ltd v\n                        Salthouse Brothers Ltd[1976] RPC 589 at 603, where similar\n                    legislation was interpreted. Clearly, if it is “likely” to cause\n                    pecuniary damage to the plaintiff, the plaintiff must be sufficiently referred\n                    to. This is not the case for the First Facebook Post. 163    I had found that the Second Facebook Post\n                    was defamatory, but that the defence of fair comment applied. It must be\n                    remembered that the Second Facebook Post was made at a time when Roy was\n                    relatively unaware of what was going on, and he had not proceeded to write the\n                    emails nor received any clarification as to what was going on. Given the wording\n                    of the Second Facebook Post, I do not find that there was malice in writing the\n                    Facebook post. I had briefly discussed the law on malice at [92] above, and\n                    would add that the Defendant’s state of mind remains relevant to a finding\n                    as to whether there is malice (seeSukamto Siaat\n                    [52]). As noted inGatleyat para 21.7: There is no liability in malicious falsehood for a\n                        statement published in good faith. ...Mere negligence is\n                            not malice... A statement false in fact and calculated to\n                        produce actual damage will therefore not support [an action\n                        in malicious falsehood] if it was made in the belief, even a\n                        careless belief, that it was true.The defendant may have\n                            acted stupidly in asserting a right, yet if he bona fide believed such\n                            right to exist, no action lies. [emphasis added] 164    The words of the learned authors do well to\n                    summarise both the position of the law and the actions of the Defendants in this\n                    case. Therefore, I find that the Plaintiffs’ claim under the tort of\n                    malicious falsehood as well as s 6(1) of the DA does not succeed.",
        "The chain of emails": "63     Shortly after posting the two Facebook posts,\n                    Roy sent a total of eight emails to various parties, including the Chairman of\n                    Mercy Relief, Mr T K Udairam (“Mr Udairam”), and the CEO of Mercy\n                    Relief, Mr Hassan Ahmad (“Hassan”). The content of the emails\n                    broadly relates to the spate of events described above. A summary of the emails\n                    and the dates they were sent are as follows:[note: 14] DateEmail13 Dec\n                                    2011First email, sent to Mercy\n                                            Relief (“Email 1”)15 Dec\n                                    2011Second email, sent to Mr\n                                            Udairam (“Email 2”)3 Jan\n                                    2012Third email, sent to Mr\n                                            Udairam (“Email 3”)13 Jan\n                                    2012Fourth email, sent to Mr\n                                            Udairam (“Email 4”)13 Jan\n                                    2012Fifth email, sent to Mr\n                                            Udairam (“Email 5”)21 Jan\n                                    2012Sixth email, sent to Hassan\n                                            (“Email 6”)21 Jan\n                                    2012Seventh email, sent to Hassan\n                                            (“Email 7”)23 Feb\n                                    2012Eighth email, sent to Hassan\n                                            (“Email 8”)   I refer to these emails collectively as the “chain of\n                    emails”. 64     The same legal question that must be answered\n                    is whether the content of the chain of emails is defamatory in nature. The\n                    defendants argue that the chain of emails was sent by Roy because Roy was in a\n                    “perplexing situation”. As mentioned above, on 29 November 2011,\n                    Roy had written to Hassan seeking an acknowledgment of the Donated Kairos Items\n                    and the discounts that the Defendants had given the Plaintiffs, but had not\n                    received any reply from Hassan or Mercy Relief. The chain of emails from Roy was\n                    therefore in pursuit of his “legitimate interest in asking the charity he\n                    had donated to about how the donations had been received”[note: 15](or not, as the case may be). To this end, I\n                    share some sympathy for Roy insofar as the replies from the various parties may\n                    not have been as clear as they could have been in addressingdirectlythe concerns raised by Roy. 65     However, even if the replies Roy received to\n                    his email queries could be said to be unsatisfactory, it does not cure or excuse\n                    any defamatory sting in the contents of the email queries. Simply because the\n                    Defendants received an unsatisfactory reply from a third party does not give\n                    them the right to make defamatory remarks of another, especially so when this is\n                    based on personal uncorroborated suspicions. That said, the reason for sending\n                    the email queries may allow Roy to rely on the defence of qualified privilege,\n                    which will be considered later on. 66     The Plaintiffs assert that the chain of emails\n                    bears a number of defamatory imputations. As in the case of the Facebook posts,\n                    the words complained of in the eight emails were pleaded to be defamatory in\n                    their natural and ordinary meaning. 67     For convenience, the Plaintiff said to be\n                    defamed by each email[note: 16]are as follows: (a)     Email 1: First and Third\n                        Plaintiffs; (b)     Email 2: First and Third Plaintiffs; (c)     Email 3: Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second\n                        Plaintiff in respect of an allegation of having outstanding\n                    debts; (d)     Email 4:\n                        Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second Plaintiff in respect of an\n                        allegation of having outstanding debts; (e)     Email 5: First and Third\n                    Plaintiffs; (f)     Email\n                        6: Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second Plaintiff in respect of\n                        an allegation that it gave the Defendants permission to use photographs\n                        belonging to Mercy Relief; (g)     Email 7: Primarily the First and Third Plaintiffs. Second\n                        Plaintiff in respect of an allegation that it gave the Defendants permission\n                        to use photographs belonging to Mercy Relief; and (h)     Email 8: Primarily the First and Third\n                        Plaintiffs. Second Plaintiff in respect of allegations of outstanding debts\n                        and permission to use the photographs belonging to Mercy\n                    Relief. 68     In respect of each email, the Statement of\n                    Claim sets out the particular words said to be defamatory. Detailed particulars\n                    of the defamatory meaning (on the basis of the natural and ordinary meaning) of\n                    the words were also set out in the Statement of Claim in respect of each\n                    email. 69     Since many of the statements and alleged\n                    meanings are repetitive or similar, a few examples of the alleged natural and\n                    ordinary meanings said to be defamatory will suffice to illustrate the alleged\n                    stings. To be clear, these stings or defamatory meanings are based on the\n                    particular words and statements contained in the emails and which were also set\n                    out in the Statement of Claim. The alleged defamatory stings include, for\n                    example, that[note: 17]: (a)     the First and Third Plaintiffs\n                        misled, deceived, tricked and conned the Defendants into selling Kairos\n                        boats at a discounted price whilst having no intention whatsoever to donate\n                        the same to a charitable cause;[note: 18] (b)     the First and Third Plaintiffs did not donate the Kairos\n                        boats to Mercy Relief but instead sold them at a profit, and hence are\n                        crooks and cheats;[note: 19] (c)     the First and Third Plaintiffs intended to deceive Mercy\n                        Relief into believing that all the donated items were from the Plaintiffs,\n                        thus robbing the Defendants of any credit;[note: 20] (d)     the First Plaintiff was not a trustworthy corporate\n                            citizen;[note: 21] (e)     the First and Third Plaintiffs would cause Roy and his\n                        family grave personal harm and damage to his business such that Roy had to\n                        make a police report;[note: 22] (f)     that a police report had to be made\n                        against the First Plaintiff because they conducted their business in an\n                        illegal manner;[note: 23] (g)     that the Second Plaintiff had outstanding debts with the\n                        Defendants and was in poor financial shape;[note: 24] (h)     that the First and Third Plaintiffs were in a position of\n                        conflict of interest and the Defendants had to make a report to the\n                            COC;[note: 25] (i)     the Third Plaintiff had carried out illegal fund raising\n                        on behalf of Mercy Relief;[note: 26] (j)     the Plaintiffs deliberately infringed the\n                        Defendants’ registered trademarks and copyright;[note: 27]and (k)     the First and Third Plaintiffs had used Mercy\n                        Relief’s photographs illegally in breach of Mercy Relief’s\n                            copyright.[note: 28] 70     On the whole, while I do not agree with every\n                    single imputation of defamatory meaning as alleged (such as the imputation of\n                    illegal fund raising for Mercy Relief), I am of the view that there is some\n                    merit to the Plaintiffs’ argument that the contents of the chain of emails\n                    are defamatory in nature. 71     As briefly alluded to above, the test for\n                    determining the natural and ordinary meaning of allegedly defamatory words is\n                    the meaning that the words would \"convey to an ordinary reasonable person, not\n                    unduly suspicious or avid for scandal, using his general knowledge and common\n                    sense\" (seeReview Publishing Co Ltd v Lee Hsien\n                        Loong[2010] 1 SLR 52 at [27]). It is also important to note that\n                    the chain of emails was published primarily to Mr Udairam and Hassan, and\n                    therefore, their interpretation of Roy’s email would continue to develop\n                    with each email they received. I therefore considered the chain of emails\n                    together. (I considered those sent to Mr Udairam and those sent to Hassan\n                    separately.) 72     Reading the chain of emails both individually\n                    and together, they strongly suggest that the Plaintiffs, at the very least, are\n                    guilty of some misconduct in dealing with either the Defendants or Mercy Relief.\n                    This is especially so in the context of the donations that the Plaintiffs had\n                    provided to Mercy Relief. Throughout the chain of emails, it is clear to me that\n                    Roy is insinuating some form of malfeasance on the part of the Plaintiffs. The\n                    contents of the chain of emails, as well as the tone used, generally seek to\n                    question the Plaintiffs’ actions and their honesty. I state a few example\n                    statements in the chain of emails which, in my judgment, bear some defamatory\n                    meaning: EmailStatementEmail 1“For the safety of my\n                                            family and the good name that we have built, I have made\n                                            a police report a few hours ago. I have not slept till\n                                            now as the statement took a\n                                    while.”Email 2“A police report has\n                                            been made by me and there could be grounds of cheating\n                                            and other related matters.”Email 3“We had to make sure\n                                            that our corporate discounted prices was meant for Mercy\n                                            Relief and not resold or marked up with other products\n                                            that was supplied…”“Fyi, we do give\n                                            corporate discounts for disaster efforts as part of our\n                                            donations for corporate clients.”“In that context, we\n                                            feel cheated that our donations and discounts ended\n                                            without any evidence and those other mentioned items\n                                            will be returned back.”“Our trademark and\n                                            copyright was infringed (as we found out later on) and\n                                            those inflatable boats we donated was not mentioned in\n                                            your CEO’s reply to me”“Then how did those\n                                            inflatable boats turned up as ‘sponsored’\n                                            when the value of those are equally high?

It is also not\n                    disputed that the elements of reference to the Plaintiffs and publication are\n                    also met.",
        "The Short Message Service (“SMS”) texts": "74     On 5 October 2012, Roy sent three SMS texts to\n                    Francis stating the following:[note: 29] Dear francis, I just wanted to inform you that, I reported tedric ling to\n                        the police A few months ago. Did u know abt it? Roy soeigiarto Francis, can we meet for coffee? Btw tedric aka Golden Season wants to get\n                        $300k from me for defamation. U know abt that? Roy I only ask of you to be truthful and not be afraid. Come what may, the\n                        truth will be out abt Tedric and the way he do his business. I am sorry that\n                        you are involved. You know better, I wish it does not have to be this way\n                        and I also do not wish to be this way as I was dragged into this! Just\n                        wanted to affirm you to trust your hear. Tks for the reply. Roy 75     Reading the third SMS on its own, I am of the\n                    view that the third SMS is not defamatory in nature. While, to a certain extent,\n                    the phrase, “the truth will be out [about] Tedric and the way he do his\n                    business” might suggest that Tedric is conducting his business in an\n                    improper or illegal manner, I am not ready to find that the ordinary reader will\n                    conclusively draw this meaning from this phrase alone. The phrase could just as\n                    well mean that Tedric is a hard or aggressive businessman. 76     However, the first SMS, which states that a\n                    police report had been made against Tedric, is slightly trickier. Leaving aside\n                    the fact that Roy had indeed made a police report, the question is whether an\n                    ordinary reader would infer from the ordinary meaning of these words that Tedric\n                    had conducted his business in an illegal manner or that he had threatened some\n                    harm against Roy. On its own, I am of the view that the ordinary reader would\n                    not infer from the first SMS that harm had been threatened against Roy. This can\n                    be compared, for example, with Email 1 where Roy stated in no uncertain terms\n                    that: …for the safety of my family and the good name that we have built,\n                        I have made a police report a few hours ago. I have not slept till now as\n                        the statement took a while. 77     The position, however, may be different if\n                    these three SMS texts are viewed as a whole. Whether or not the statement in the\n                    first SMS that he had made a police report against Tedric is defamatory depends\n                    on how the statement would be perceived by an ordinary person in the position of\n                    Francis. It is clear that ordinarily a statement that X is under investigation\n                    does not imply that X is guilty of an offence. As stated inGatley on Libel and Slander(Alastair Mullis & Richard\n                    Parkes eds) (Sweet & Maxwell, 12th Ed, 2013) (“Gatley 2013”) at para 3.28, if the law was\n                    otherwise, it would be almost impossible to give accurate information about\n                    anything. 78     Where the statement means nothing more than\n                    the fact that there is an investigation or that a complaint has been made, a\n                    serious question must arise as to whether the statement is defamatory. Indeed,\n                    even if it is defamatory, the statement may be justified by showing that an\n                    investigation is being conducted or that a complaint had indeed been made. The\n                    question in many cases is whether the ordinary reader would understand the words\n                    as meaning more: namely that X is guilty or that there is some reasonable basis\n                    for suspecting that an illegality or offence has been committed. 79     It is also stated inGatley\n                        2013at para 2.28 that “it may be defamatory to say that\n                    someone is suspected of an offence even where that does not imply guilt”.\n                    Much will depend on the context in which the statement was made and how the\n                    statement will be perceived by an ordinary reader. Is there an implication that\n                    there is a reasonable basis for the investigation or suspicion? If so, subject\n                    to defences, liability for defamation arises. 80     For example, inDe Souza\n                        Tay & Goh (suing as a firm) v Singapore Press Holdings Ltd and another\n                        suit[2001] 2 SLR(R) 201, an article was published in The Straits\n                    Times about a company that was being investigated by the United States\n                    Securities and Exchange Commission. The article took up almost a third of an\n                    entire page and comprised words and graphics. The words included “But a\n                    cloud has been cast over this with launch of a probe into the recent surge in\n                    its Asia sales by the US Securities and Exchange Commission” and\n                    “… possibility that [the company’s] fast sales growth may\n                    not be all that it appears”. Lee Seiu Kin JC (as he then was) added at\n                    [24] that these statements had to be read in the context of the emphasis in the\n                    article that two individuals who were shareholders of the company’s\n                    licensees had acted as directors for 678 companies, many of which appeared to be\n                    shell companies and that the same two individuals were linked to 15 companies\n                    with the same address and which had paid US$57 million to the company for\n                    software licences. In this context, Lee Seiu Kin JC found that the ordinary,\n                    reasonable reader would interpret the article to mean that the company had used\n                    these companies to manipulate financial transactions to create the impression of\n                    a high turnover in 1999 and were guilty of fraudulent conduct. At the very least\n                    it was found that the article bore the defamatory meaning that there were\n                    reasonable grounds to suspect fraud. 81     In the present case, looking at the first SMS\n                    on its own, I am not satisfied that the ordinary, reasonable reader (in the\n                    position of Francis) would conclude that that there were reasonable grounds to\n                    suspect Tedric to be guilty of an offence. 82     The issue is whether the three SMS texts\n                    should be treated as separate and distinct messages or as part of single chain\n                    of communication to be read as a whole. On the evidence, it appears that the\n                    messages were sent at or about the same time and were essentially part of a\n                    single communication to Francis. Any reader in the position of Francis would be\n                    well aware of the business dispute between Tedric and Roy. On balance I am not\n                    satisfied that the three SMS texts, even when read as a whole is defamatory. The\n                    statement that a police report had been made was followed by the message that a\n                    defamation suit had been brought by Tedric for “300K”. This was\n                    followed by the request that Francis “be truthful and not be\n                    afraid” and that “come what may, the truth will be out abt Tedric\n                    and the way he do his business.” The SMS messages as a whole conveys to\n                    the ordinary, reasonable reader that a serious legal dispute between Tedric and\n                    Roy had arisen out of business dealings. This meaning is not defamatory without\n                    any more. The SMS messages do not necessarily bear the meaning that Tedric is\n                    guilty of an offence or that there are good grounds to think that an offence had\n                    been committed.",
        "Conclusion on the defamatory articles": "83     In summary, I find that the elements of the\n                    tort of defamation has been established by the Plaintiffs for: (a)     the Second Facebook Post;\n                    and (b)     the chain of\n                        emails sent to Mr Udairam and Hassan.",
        "Can the Defendants rely on the defences of justification, qualified\n                privilege or fair comment?": "84     I now turn to examine whether the Defendants\n                    can rely on any of the established defences in order to absolve them of\n                    liability. I start first with a brief review of the principles of law applicable\n                    to the defences, before applying it to the facts at hand. The law concerning the\n                    defences available to a defendant in a defamation action is not contentious, and\n                    in summary, I find that the Defendants can rely on the defence of fair comment\n                    for the Second Facebook Post but not on any defence for the chain of\n                    emails.",
        "The law": "205    It is trite that in order to succeed in an\n                    action under the tort of passing off, a plaintiff must establish the\n                    “classical trinity” of goodwill, misrepresentation and damage (seeNovelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 216 (“Amanresorts”)\n                    at [37]). Passing off in its classic form occurs when one trader represents his\n                    goods to be those of another trader. As summarised by Lord Oliver inReckitt & Colman Products Ltd v Borden Inc[1990] 1\n                    WLR 491 at 880: The law of passing off can be summarised in one short general proposition:\n                        no man may pass off his goods as those of another. More specifically, it may\n                        be expressed in terms of the elements which the plaintiff in such an action\n                        has to prove in order to succeed. These are three in number. First, he must\n                        establish a goodwill or reputation attached to the goods or services which\n                        he supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by association with the\n                        identifying “get-up” (whether it consists simply of a brand\n                        name or a trade description, or the individual features of labelling or\n                        packaging) under which his particular goods or services are offered to the\n                        public, such that the get-up is recognised by the public as distinctive\n                        specifically of the plaintiff’s goods or services. Secondly, he must\n                        demonstrate a misrepresentation by the defendant to the public (whether or\n                        not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods\n                        or services offered by him are the goods or services of the\n                        plaintiff…Thirdly, he must demonstrate that he suffers or, in aquia timetaction that he is likely to\n                        suffer damage by reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the\n                        defendant’s misrepresentation that the source of the defendant’s\n                        goods or services is the same as the source of those offered by the\n                        plaintiff. 206    In this case, however, it appears that the\n                    Defendants do not claim that the Plaintiffs have represented the\n                    Plaintiffs’ goods as those of the Defendants. It is, in fact, the converse\n                    – the Defendants claim that the Plaintiffs are representingthe Defendants’goods as those of the Plaintiffs.\n                    This is, therefore, not a classic case of passing off, but instead, a case of\n                    “inverse passing off”. 207    There have not been many cases on inverse\n                    passing off in Singapore, though the doctrine is clearly part of our law, as\n                    affirmed by the Singapore Court of Appeal inTessensohn\n                        Denyse Bernadette (trading as Clea Professional Image Consultants) v John\n                        Robert Powers School Inc and others[1994] 3 SLR 308\n                        (“John Robert Powers\n                    School”). 208    To this end, I start with the observation\n                    that while “inverse passing off is not a nominate tort in its own right\n                    but is an example of an actionable misrepresentation to which the normal\n                    principles of passing off apply” (seeQB Net Co Ltd v\n                        Earnson Management (S) Pte Ltd and others[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1 at\n                    [16]), the boundaries and scope of inverse passing off are not as well developed\n                    as classic passing off. 209    I begin with the decision of the Court of\n                    Appeal inJohn Robert Powers School, which\n                    affirmed the doctrine of inverse passing off. At [25], the Court of Appeal held\n                    that: It is clear to us that not only is it passing-off to misrepresent that\n                        one’s goods or services were those of another, butit is also passing-off to misrepresent the inverse: that another\n                            person’s goods or services are one’s own. The\n                        three essential elements of passing off equally apply to such passing-off as\n                        well. Therefore, to succeed in an action for inverse passing-off, a\n                        plaintiff must prove that there is goodwill attached to their goods or\n                        services; that the defendants misrepresented themselves as the commercial\n                        source of the goods or services in question; and that the plaintiff’s\n                        goodwill was damaged as a consequence. [Emphasis added] 210    InJohn Robert Powers\n                        School, the first respondent, John Robert Powers School Inc\n                    (“JRP”), was a well-known American company which operated the John\n                    Robert Powers School in the US providing courses on social development and\n                    self-improvement. The appellant obtained a franchisee license and operated a JRP\n                    school in Singapore. This franchise agreement was terminated on 14 February\n                    1988. Thereafter, the appellant set up her own school under the name Clea\n                    Professional Image Consultants. The respondents later alleged,inter alia, that the appellant had passed off her school\n                    as JRP and her courses as JRP courses. 211    One of the issues that arose was whether, by\n                    using material previously owned by JRP, in terms of allowing access to students\n                    and teachers to the materials, the appellant was liable for “inverse\n                    passing off”. At [26], the Court of Appeal affirmed the decision of the\n                    High Court, finding that: Copies of the JRP notes had been left on shelves for all to take without\n                        the notes containing any acknowledgement of their source. Anyone who took\n                        them would naturally have thought that they were the work of the appellant.\n                        Although the appellant did not distribute these notes to the students, they\n                        were left on the open shelves and were easily accessible to the students.\n                        The inference was that they were left there deliberately for certain\n                        purpose,ieto render them accessible to the\n                        students. Thus, by making the notes available in that manner, she was in\n                        fact holding out to her students and customers that the notes were the\n                        product of her own efforts. 212    At the High Court (seeJohn Robert Powers School Inc v Tessensohn Denyse Bernadette[1993] 2 SLR(R) 798 (“John Robert Powers School\n                        (HC)”), the trial judge had cited the decisions ofBristol Conservatories Ltd v Conservatories Custom Built\n                        Ltd[1989] RPC 455 (“Bristol\n                        Conservatories”) andJohn Henderson\n                        & Sons v Alexander Munro[1905] 7 F 636 (“John Henderson”) in explaining the concept of\n                    inverse passing off. These decisions, in turn, are based on a number of English\n                    decisions which merit closer scrutiny. 213    A useful starting point is the decision of\n                    the English Court of Appeal inSamuelson v Producers\n                        Distributing Co Ltd(1931) 48 RPC 580 and at [1932] 1 Ch 201\n                        (“Samuelson”). InSamuelson, the plaintiff wrote a theatrical sketch that\n                    was performed before the King and Queen and received good (laudatory) press\n                    notices. The defendants made a film said to be similar in some respects to the\n                    plaintiffs’ sketch. It was admitted, however, that as a whole, it was\n                    different and did not constitute copyright infringement. The defendants\n                    advertised their film referencing the press notices (which had been deliberately\n                    modified) so as to make them appear to refer to the film. There was no reference\n                    to the plaintiff in the advertisement. It was submitted for the defendants that\n                    the claim could not lie in passing off because that form of action required a\n                    representation whereby other persons are induced to believe that the goods or\n                    the production of the defendants are the goods or production of the\n                    plaintiff. 214    The Court of Appeal rejected the\n                    defendant’s argument, finding them liable for passing off. Although it was\n                    a unanimous decision, there are slight differences in the reasoning\n                    employed. 215    Lord Hanworth at 588 stated: It is a passing off action and the ground on which I think the plaintiff\n                        is entitled to complain is that, as I have said, in substance he remains the\n                        author of this sketch .... and,if he was entitled to the\n                            authorship and the copyright and to the reproduction of his sketch, then\n                            the defendants have attempted to pass off and to make use of the\n                            atmosphere which belonged to the plaintiff, in favour of\n                        their production; and therefore it was right for the plaintiff to take\n                        proceedings. [Emphasis added] I note in passing that in theChancery Division\n                        Reportof the case, the equivalent passage from Lord\n                    Hanworth’s judgment at 208 refers to “use of the reputation which\n                    belonged to the plaintiff’s sketch” as opposed to the\n                    “atmosphere”. No matter, the core of Lord Hanworth’s\n                    reasoning appears to be founded on unfair competition or\n                appropriation. 216    Lawrence LJ, on the other hand, framed the\n                    matter in a way which is perhaps closer to the classic form of passing off. At\n                    592, he stated: The plaintiff and his licensees had the exclusive right of making a film\n                        version of the sketch, and the defendant company, in effect, by the\n                        advertisement, said that their production was a film version of the\n                        plaintiff's sketch,thereby misleading the public\n                            concerned into the belief that the defendants' production was a\n                            production which was one which the plaintiff alone could have\n                            produced;in other words, that it was the\n                            plaintiff's production. To put it in other words, they were\n                        passing off on to the public their film production as being a film\n                        production of the plaintiff's sketch. [Emphasis added] In this way, it could be argued that this was a classic case of\n                    passing off instead of reverse passing off. As can be seen, Lawrence LJ held\n                    that the public would have thought that the defendant’s production was\n                    produced by the plaintiff. 217    Romer LJ whilst acknowledging that this was\n                    not a classic case of passing went on to hold (at 593) that: But the cases in which the court has restrained passing off in the popular\n                        and usual sense, are merely instances of the application by the court of a\n                        much wider principle, the principle being that the court will always\n                        interfere by injunction to restrain irreparable injury being done to the\n                        plaintiff's property. In the present case if, as we hold to be the case, the\n                        plaintiff was entitled to his copyright in 'The New Car', [his sketch) he\n                        was, by virtue of the Copyright Act, entitled to the sole right of producing\n                        the sketch in film form. That was an item of his property, and how it can be\n                        said that these advertisements might not cause irreparable damage to that\n                        property of the plaintiff passes my comprehension. What is clear is that all three judges agreed that, even though\n                    the facts did not fall squarely within a classic case of passing off, the\n                    defendant was liable. 218    I turn next to the case ofPlomien Fuel Economiser Co Ltd v National School of Salesmanship\n                        Ltd(1943) 60 RPC 209 (“Plomein”), which is another decision of the English Court\n                    of Appeal. InPlomein, the plaintiffs were\n                    manufacturers of a fuel economiser marketed under the name\n                    “Plomien”. The defendants, who at one time acted as sale agents\n                    for the plaintiffs, broke that relationship and started themselves to market an\n                    economiser which was manufactured for them. It was alleged that the defendants\n                    engaged in a deliberate attempt to deceive their clients by putting forward\n                    their economiser as being the same as the plaintiffs. Specifically, it was\n                    alleged that they represented that certain tests which had been made were tests\n                    made in connection with the defendants' economiser. In fact, they were tests in\n                    respect of the plaintiffs' economiser. They represented that certain economisers\n                    which had been fitted for a number of purchasers, and which were in fact the\n                    plaintiffs' economiser, were the defendants' economiser. 219    The Court of Appeal, likewise, found the\n                    defendants liable for passing off. It was argued there that no confusion had\n                    arisen. The fact being that none of the customers who purchased the goods from\n                    the defendants knew the plaintiffs. Lord Greene, however, disagreed and at 214,\n                    explained why the action would still succeed: It is perfectly true that there is no evidence that a single person who\n                        purchased an economiser from the defendants had ever heard of the\n                        plaintiffs; but in passing off there is no necessity that the person who is\n                        deceived should have known the name of the person who complains of the\n                        passing off. In many cases the name is not known at all. It is quite\n                        sufficient, in my opinion, to constitute passing off in fact, if a person\n                        being minded to obtain goods which are identified in his mind with a\n                        definite commercial source is led by false statements to accept goods coming\n                        from a different commercial source … Having got them in their shop, what do they do?They do\n                            not sell those customers the goods which those customers have come to\n                            buy; they sell them goods of their own manufacture, which are quite\n                            different, in the sense that they are not the required\n                            manufacture.If that is not passing off, I really do not know\n                        what is. It is perfectly true, and I am willing to assume, that not one\n                        single customer who went to the shop (I use the word 'shop' of course\n                        metaphorically, it was not a shop at all; it was done by orders by post and\n                        by travellers and so forth) had ever heard of the plaintiffs or ever heard\n                        that they put on the market an economiser.That, to my\n                            mind, matters not one bit when it is realised that those customers were\n                            coming with the intention of getting goods from a particular source,\n                            namely, the same source as those from which the satisfied customers had\n                            got their goods. [Emphasis added] 220    As can be seen, the reasoning employed inPlomeinis not far removed from that of\n                    Lawrence LJ inSamuelson– at the end of the\n                    day, the consumer on the particular facts is made to believe that the product he\n                    purchases is from aparticular source(ie, the plaintiff), when in fact it came from the\n                    defendant. To that end, this still fits within the classic conception of the\n                    tort of passing off, as the consumer is still misled to believe that the\n                    defendant’s goods are those of the plaintiff (the particular source the\n                    consumer had in mind). It does not matter if the consumer does not know the\n                    actual identity of the plaintiff. 221    BothSamuelsonandPlomeinwere considered by the Court of Appeal\n                    inBristol Conservatories(which was, in turn,\n                    considered by the Singapore High Court inJohn Robert Powers\n                        School (HC)). InBristol\n                        Conservatories, the defendants’ salesmen showed prospective\n                    customers a portfolio of photographs of ornamental conservatories as if these\n                    constituted a sample of the defendants’ goods and workmanship. In fact,\n                    these were photographs of the plaintiff’s ornamental conservatories. This\n                    was held to amount to passing off as the defendants had misrepresented that they\n                    were the commercial source of those conservatories. As stated by Ralph Gibson LJ\n                    at 462: In this case the substance of the misrepresentation by the defendants, as\n                        alleged by the plaintiffs, is fairly capable of being expressed thus: \"If\n                        you order a conservatory from us you will be getting a conservatory\n                        designed, manufactured and constructed by the people who have earned the\n                        goodwill and reputation that properly belongs to the party which secured the\n                        orders and designed, manufactured and constructed the conservatories shown\n                        in these photographs. The conservatories shown in the photographs indicate\n                        the skill, the experience and the reputation of the party who designed and\n                        made them. That party is Custom Built.\" But, of course, it was not. 222    By showing the photographs to prospective\n                    customers, goodwill arose towards the supplier of those conservatories and was\n                    simultaneously misappropriated by the defendants. The Court of Appeal found that\n                    there was likewise no need for the public to have been “confused”\n                    – “he is told simply and untruthfully that Custom Built designed\n                    and constructed the conservatories which provide the evidence for the experience\n                    skill and reputation of the Plaintiffs.” This was sufficient to sustain\n                    an action in passing off. As can be seen, the focus still concerns thesourceof the product. The public is misled to think\n                    that they are purchasing a product from a manufacturer with a certain amount of\n                    goodwill, while in fact, they are purchasing a product from the\n                    defendants. 223    In coming to this view, I agree with the\n                    comment by the learned authors of David Kitchinet al,\n                        Kerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names(Sweet &\n                    Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2011) (“Kerly’s”) at para 18-132 that the reason why liability\n                    was found was because customers were deceived into believing that the defendant\n                    was the company that produced the conservatory depicted in the photographs. To\n                    this end, the learned authors’ comment bears repeating: Although it was open to the defendant to use photographs of the\n                        claimant’s product to indicate that it could make products like it, it\n                        went further and made an actionable misrepresentation which could have\n                        caused damage to the claimant in the form of lost sales (in the sense that\n                        all the defendant’s potential customers could have been customers of\n                        the claimant had not the representation been made). 224    The important point, as the learned authors\n                    ofKerly’sstress at para 18-132, is that\n                    the tort of passing off is not a tort providing a remedy inallcases of deception. Passing off is not about deceptive\n                    statementsin vacuo. Neither is passing off a tort\n                    that covers product mis-descriptionper se. The\n                    learned authors quite rightly stress that there must be an actionable\n                    misrepresentation which harms the claimant’s goodwill in a name or get-up.\n                    Mere appropriation is insufficient. 225    I return to the decision inJohn Robert Powers School. Comparing the cases discussed\n                    above and the situation inJohn Robert Powers\n                        School, the High Court observed that the only difference between\n                    the two was that in the former, the misappropriation was done in the course of\n                    advertisement whereas in the latter, the misappropriation was done in the course\n                    of the trade itself. It was reasoned that that should make no difference to the\n                    plaintiffs’ entitlement to a remedy. This was accepted by the Court of\n                    Appeal, who affirmed that a defendant can be liable for “inverse passing\n                    off” and that the trinity of goodwill, misrepresentation and confusion\n                    still applied. What is meant by “confusion” is that the consumer\n                    is deceived as to the trade origin of the products. 226    As a result of the decision inJohn Robert Powers School, whatever view is taken of the\n                    facts of the case, a defendant, in Singapore, can be liable when he passes off\n                    the goods of someone else as his own under what is known as “inverse\n                    passing off”. I would further observe that given the discussion in the\n                    paragraph above, there is clearly room to develop this concept in Singapore law.\n                    Given the relative lack of case authority on inverse passing off, a few\n                    observations on the rationale for inverse passing off may be helpful before\n                    turning to an application to the facts at hand. The policy reasons of passing off and the goodwill 227    At first blush, it is perhaps understandable\n                    if the concept of inverse passing off, as recognised inJohn\n                        Robert Powers School, is regarded as not sitting nicely within\n                    the framework and policy reasons justifying the existence of the law of passing\n                    off. As observed by the author in Ng-Loy Wee Loon,Law of\n                        Intellectual Property of Singapore(Sweet & Maxwell Asia, Rev\n                    Ed, 2014) (\"Ng-Loy on IP Law\") at para\n                    18.1.15: Given that there was nothing in the defendant’s course notes which\n                        expressly referred to the plaintiff, it is difficult to see how there could\n                        be passing off in the sense that the students would connect the\n                        defendant’s school with the plaintiff (albeit in the reverse way).\n                        Where is the confusion when the defendant shows a customer the\n                        plaintiff’s product as an example of his (the defendant’s) work\n                        when the customer who buys from the defendant knows he is buying from the\n                        defendant? Strictly speaking, reverse passing off just does not fit nicely\n                        within the boundaries of passing off. The author, however, goes on (also at para 18.1.15) to provide a\n                    possible way of interpreting the decision: One way of understanding this concept of inverse or reverse passing off is\n                        to recognise that it is really an extension of the classic form of passing\n                        off to prevent what the court sees as free riding. This analysis of inverse\n                        passing off is offered by Prof Gerald Dworkin. In his study comparing the\n                        ways in which different countries prevent unfair competition, he found that\n                        in common law countries where there is no general tort of unfair\n                        competition, the courts cope to a large extent by expanding the action for\n                        passing off. The High Court’s judgment inJohn\n                            Robert Powerscase certainly contains suggestions that would\n                        support Prof Dworkin’s analysis. In finding for the plaintiff, the\n                        court used terms such as the defendant ‘robbing’ the\n                        plaintiff’s goodwill, and how this goodwill was\n                        ‘misappropriated’ by the defendant to build her own\n                        reputation. 228    That said, Hazel Carty inAn Analysis of the Economic Torts, (Oxford University Press, 2nd\n                    Ed, 2010) comments at p 290 that cases such asBristol\n                        Conservatoriesare best seen as examples falling within the\n                    classic trinity. Goodwill lies at the heart of the classic trinity. In cases of\n                    true inverse passing off, the allegation (or misrepresentation) is that a\n                    quality misrepresentation has taken place resulting in damage to goodwill.\n                    Whilst there is merit in this view (that inverse passing off derives from and is\n                    consistent with the classic trinity), it should be noted that a loose\n                    application of the elements runs the risk of turning the tort into\n                    misappropriationsimpliciter: a tort based on some\n                    broad notion of unfairness. For this reason, it is important to apply the\n                    elements (goodwill, misrepresentation and likelihood of deception) with care.\n                    Whether the common law in Singapore should go further and develop a true tort of\n                    unfair competition is not a matter which must be decided in the case at hand.\n                    The development of a general tort of misappropriation or unfair competition\n                    involves broad-based policy concerns involving aspects of intellectual property\n                    law as well as competition law. 229    Moving on, I note that the tort of passing\n                    off exists primarily to protect the interest of a trader in his trade mark and\n                    indicia of origin. By doing this, consumer interests are also safeguarded. As\n                    stated inNg-Loy on IP Lawat para 15.2.1, a\n                    trader’s indicia of origin saves the consumer search time and costs and\n                    results in a better allocation of resources. The learned author\n                    continues: From this perspective, traders should be encouraged to differentiate their\n                        goods or services from those of other traders, and to invest time, effort\n                        and money to create and develop a trade mark to act as the badge of origin\n                        and/or of quality for their goods or services. Protecting the trader’s\n                        trade mark is an incentive for him to make these investments. Trade mark\n                        protection is justified on this economic and utilitarian basis. The other justification lies in the ‘just desserts’ theory:\n                        the trader deserves protection for the time and effort he spent in building\n                        up a particular sign as his trade mark, and he should be protected against\n                        unfair competition from traders who are out to take a free ride on the\n                        goodwill or reputation he has acquired for his goods or services. 230    One can see how these justifications are\n                    addressed in the case ofBristol Conservatories,SamuelsonandPlomein. From the perspective of the consumer, a mistake is made\n                    as to the attributes (workmanship, quality etc) of the product (the\n                    conservatory, the film, the economiser) that he is acquiring from the defendant.\n                    The consumer is induced to believe that the defendant is also the manufacturer\n                    of or associated with certain similar products or services which enjoy goodwill\n                    in the market place. The consumer is, thereby, induced to acquire the\n                    defendant’s goods or services in the belief that the defendant’s\n                    goods or services enjoy or share that same goodwill when in fact the goodwill in\n                    those other goods or services belongs to a third party (the plaintiff). The fact\n                    that the consumer does not know of the third party is irrelevant. 231    InBristol\n                        Conservatories, the photographs of the plaintiffs’ product\n                    suggested a certain level of skill and competence of the origin. InSamuelson, the positive press notices likewise suggested\n                    some form of skill or quality since it was positively received by others. InPlomein, the test results likewise suggested\n                    quality. In all three cases, the defendant could be said to exploit the goodwill\n                    of the plaintiff in order to mislead the consumer into buying the\n                    defendant’s product. In this way the goodwill which the plaintiff enjoyed\n                    in his business and the goods and services marketed under his business is\n                    damaged. The defendant/seller/provider has wrongly appropriated the goodwill of\n                    the plaintiff by false attribution to the defendant. In a sense, the defendant\n                    is “high-jacking” the goodwill of the plaintiff. 232    It follows that notwithstanding the\n                    recognition of inverse passing off, the core interest protected is still\n                    goodwill. The reasoning of Lord Diplock inErven Warnink\n                        Besloten Vennootschap v J Townend & Sons (Hull) Ltd[1979] AC\n                    731 at 740 (commonly known as “TheAdvocaatcase”) bears repeating: Unfair trading as a wrong actionable at the suit of other traders who\n                        thereby suffer loss of business or goodwill may take a variety of forms, to\n                        some of which separate labels have become attached in English law.\n                        Conspiracy to injure a person in his trade or business is one, slander of\n                        goods another, but most protean is that which is generally and nowadays,\n                        perhaps misleadingly, described as passing off. The forms that unfair\n                        trading takes will alter with the ways in which trade is carried on and\n                        business reputation and goodwill acquired. 233    In a classic case of passing off, the\n                    goodwill in a business is connected with the trade mark of (an indicator of\n                    origin) the plaintiff. In deciding whether the element of goodwill is present,\n                    the court generally looks at whether the plaintiff’s trade mark has\n                    acquired a reputation. As accepted inThe Singapore\n                        Professional Golfers' Association v Chen Eng Waye and others[2013] 2 SLR 495 (“SPGA”): Goodwill has been described as \"the attractive force which brings in\n                            custom\":The Commissioners of Inland Revenue v\n                            Muller & Co's Margarine, Limited[1901] AC\n                        217 at 224. It connotes the magnetic quality of the product and its\n                        association with the claimant such that customers return and patronise the\n                        same business, or purchase the same product or other products from the same\n                            brand:Bently &\n                        Sherman([16]supra) at p 729. The goodwill in question is\n                        the integral feature of the relationship between a trader and his customers\n                        that the tort of passing off seeks to protect. The action for passing off is\n                        not directly concerned with the protection of a mark, logo or get-up of a\n                        business. That is more the province of the law of trade marks. Rather,\n                        passing off is concerned with protecting the goodwill between a trader and\n                        his customers:CDL\n                        Hotels([12] supra) at [45]. 234    In the classic case of passing off, the\n                    goodwill is associated with the brand represented by the badge of origin. It is\n                    therefore (as stated by the Court of Appeal inSPGAat [36]): essential for the claimant to establish that its goodwill is sufficiently\n                        associated with its name or brand such that its name or brand is\n                        distinctive,in that it denotes the goods and services of\n                            the claimant to the exclusion of those of other\n                        traders. [Emphasis added] 235    In a case of inverse passing off, the\n                    defendant is essentially trying to ride on the reputation (goodwill) of the\n                    plaintiff so as to market his own goods or services. 236    Thus inBristol\n                        Conservatories, it could be said that some form of goodwill is\n                    generated upon the consumer recognising the quality of the plaintiff’s\n                    product, as represented by photographs set out in the Defendant’s\n                    brochure. InBristol Conservatories, the court at\n                    465 explained: Lastly, the judge was wrong, I think, to proceed on the basis that the\n                        plaintiffs were not alleging that they have a goodwill which was affected by\n                        the use of the photographs. In truth, as Mr. Presctott submitted,the goodwill was asserted and demonstrated as the photographs\n                            were shown and was at the same moment misappropriated by Custom\n                            Built. [Emphasis added] 237    Similarly the good press notices of the\n                    plaintiff’s theatrical sketch (and goodwill) was used to cloak the\n                    defendant’s film inSamuelson. 238    Finally, I note that theAdvocaatcase was itself concerned with developing classic\n                    passing off to cover a form of unfair trading which resulted in damage to\n                    “shared” goodwill in the trade name “Advocaat.”\n                    Classic passing off is concerned with a case where the goodwill in a trade name\n                    belongs to a single proprietor. Shared goodwill looks to a scenario where a type\n                    of product with particular and identifiable characteristics is known to the\n                    public under a particular trade name such as “Advocaat” or\n                    “Champagne.” The public (or relevant sector of the public) is\n                    aware that goods carrying that trade name refer to goods with those\n                    characteristics. In such cases, time, effort and expense will usually have been\n                    expended, often over some time, by traders to develop the reputation and\n                    goodwill in the trade name. 239    In theAdvocaatcase, the trade name was properly used in respect of a\n                    Dutch drink made from eggs, sugar and a type of spirit. The\n                    “spurious” product marketed as “Old English\n                    Advocaat” was made from eggs, sugar and sherry. Sherry is a type of\n                    fortified wine (not a spirit) and at that time attracted lower custom duties.\n                    The spurious product was accordingly sold at a cheaper price. This was the\n                    context in which Lord Diplock on the back of strong policy considerations\n                    (unfair trading) found passing off had been committed. 240    To be sure, the tort of passing off has not\n                    yet been developed in Singapore into a general tort of unfair competition. Not\n                    all instances of “unfair trading” constitute passing off or indeed\n                    any tort. Nevertheless, within the established principles of passing off –\n                    the protection of goodwill in a “trade mark” from\n                    misrepresentations likely to cause damage, the general policy of providing a\n                    level playing field has proven helpful in developing the tort. In this way,\n                    classic passing off has expanded over the years to cover misrepresentations as\n                    to the quality of the plaintiff’s product (selling second hand goods or\n                    discontinued models as if they were new or current for example) as well as to\n                    cover cases of shared goodwill. Inverse passing off is best seen as part of the\n                    evolutionary and principled development of the tort.",
        "Application of the law": "241    The test for goodwill, the requirement of\n                    business aside, focuses on the public’s awareness of the plaintiff’s\n                    mark and association of the mark with the goods or services as an indicator of\n                    origin. Proof that the trade mark has acquired a reputation can come in the form\n                    of evidence showing sales volume, and/or the extent and amount of advertisement\n                    and media coverage of the business conducted under that mark (seeNg-Loy on IP Lawat para 17.2.2). As stated by the High\n                    Court inDoctor's Associates Inc v Lim Eng Wah (trading as\n                        SUBWAY NICHE)[2012] 3 SLR 193 (\"Subway\n                        Niche\") at [21] and accepted by the Court of Appeal inHai Tong Co (Pte) Ltd v Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd and another and\n                        another appeal[2013] 2 SLR 941 at [34], example of factors that\n                    should be taken into consideration include: (a)     the market share held by the\n                        registered mark; (b)     the nature of its use (whether or not it was intensive, widespread\n                        and long-standing); (c)     the amount invested in promoting the mark; (d)     the proportion of the relevant class\n                        of individuals who identified goods sold under the mark as emanating from a\n                        particular source; and (e)     any statements from trade associations and\n                        chambers. 242    The First Defendant is a company established\n                    in 2010 (although its name was later changed on 25 January 2012). I accept that\n                    on the evidence the name “Kairos” is not a descriptive name\n                    insofar as it does not describe boats. I also accept that the Defendants have\n                    used the trade name Kairos in relation to the boats together with the term\n                    “inflatable sampan”. Whilst inflatable sampan is to a degree\n                    descriptive, the Defendants have asserted that the term “inflatable\n                    sampan” is also distinctive of Kairos and that they have spent\n                    substantial efforts in promoting Kairos boats on the internet and through\n                    brochures. Furthermore, it is also asserted that Kairos Boats are\n                    “supplied to, among others, NGOs, disaster units, rescue teams,\n                    Government contractors, yacht charter operators and private yacht owners in\n                    Singapore as well as in the region”[note: 56]. Whilst\n                    there is little evidence supporting the claim for widespread sales, I note that\n                    there are a number of brochures promoting the Defendants and their products.\n                    Even if there is insufficient evidence to support the assertion of goodwill in\n                    the term “inflatable sampan”, I am satisfied that the Defendants\n                    have acquired a reputation under the Kairos brand such as to generate\n                    goodwill. 243    This does not mean, however, that the\n                    counterclaim for inverse passing off succeeds. To do so, it is necessary to\n                    establish that the Plaintiffs, by inclusion of photographs of Kairos boats and\n                    informational material into its modified brochuresetc, is responsible for a misrepresentation that is likely to\n                    damage the goodwill. To be clear, there is no evidence that the Defendants have\n                    acquired any goodwill in the get-up of the inflatable boats. The position is the\n                    same in respect of the use by the Plaintiffs of photographs of the Kairos boats\n                    in operation in Thailand in its communications with SRC. Damage, in this sense,\n                    broadly means appropriating the reputation of the Defendants for products of a\n                    certain quality. 244    As noted above, inBristol Conservatories, the plaintiffs’ conservatories\n                    were designed and manufactured by the plaintiffs. At 463, Ralph Gibson LJ held\n                    that the defendants, by using a portfolio of photographs of the\n                    plaintiffs’ conservatories, was misrepresenting the position such as to\n                    induce consumers to purchase conservatories from the defendants in order to get\n                    a conservatory from the commercial source which had designed, constructed the\n                    conservatories shown in the photographs. In this way, the prospective purchaser\n                    was said (at 465) to have been told untruthfully that the defendants had\n                    designed and built those conservatories (made by the plaintiffs). Those\n                    conservatories were of course evidence of the experience, skill and reputation\n                    of the plaintiffs. 245    In the present case,it is clear that the\n                    Defendants are not the manufacturers of the boats in question (or indeed the\n                    electrical pumps and engines). The boats (both the Plaintiffs and Defendants\n                    boats) were sourced from the same Chinese manufacturer. Indeed, when\n                    cross-examined, Tedric stated that the Plaintiffs’ boats were obtained\n                    from the same factory in China which supplied the Defendants. Tedric also\n                    asserted that the design was taken by the Chinese factory from Saturn\n                        Inflatables.[note: 57]Whilst there was suggestion that the\n                    Defendants asked for some modifications, the evidence on this was thin. No\n                    witness from the Chinese manufacturer gave evidence. Further whilst the\n                    Plaintiffs may have used photographs of Kairos boats in use during the Thai\n                    floods in some communications, it is to be borne in mind that aside from the two\n                    donated Kairos boats, Golden Season had indeed purchased (albeit at an alleged\n                    discount) Kairos boats for use in the Thai floods. 246    On the evidence before me (including the\n                    brochures produced by the Plaintiffs), I am not satisfied that the Plaintiffs\n                    had thereby represented that they were Kairos or that they were passing\n                    themselves off as being Kairos such as to damage the Kairos goodwill. Inverse\n                    passing off is predicated on harm to goodwill arising from a misrepresentation.\n                    In deciding whether a case has been made out the Court must examine the strength\n                    of the goodwill and reputation, the nature of the goods and the extent to which\n                    any indicia of origin is actually used in determining whether there is a\n                    misrepresentation to the ordinary consumer (not moron shopping in a hurry) such\n                    as to harm the goodwill. In the present case, is it likely that customers for\n                    the inflatable boats will be deceived into thinking that when they buy such a\n                    boat from the Plaintiffs, they are getting boats from the Defendants? Looking at\n                    the evidence as a whole, I am not satisfied that the Defendants have established\n                    a case of inverse passing off.",
        "Damages for defamation": "117    I find the Defendants liable for defamation\n                    for the chain of emails sent to Mercy Relief, and now move on to consider the\n                    quantum of damages that should be awarded to the Plaintiffs. Before doing so,\n                    however, some clarification needs to be made as to exactly who has been defamed.\n                    For ease of reference, the above analysis had generally considered the\n                    Plaintiffs collectively,ie, Tedric, Golden Season\n                    and Designer.SG together. However, for the purposes of damages, especially in\n                    considering whether aggravated or exemplary damages should be awarded, it is\n                    necessary to consider whether it is one or all of the Plaintiffs that have been\n                    defamed. This is critical because corporations, unlike individuals, are not able\n                    to rely on “injured feelings and hurt” as a kind of damage\n                    suffered. Aggravated damages are usually awarded to compensate such\n                    losses.",
        "Who has been defamed?": "118    The answer to the question above must be\n                    derived from the plain ordinary reading of the defamatory material by a\n                    reasonable man. At the very least, it is clear that the Third Plaintiff, Tedric,\n                    has been defamed. The chain of emails constantly refers to Tedric and the emails\n                    are worded such that it is suggested that Tedric is in control of the First\n                    Plaintiff, Golden Season, as well as the Second Plaintiff, Designer.SG, and that\n                    he has been the mastermind behind the whole incident. Although both Golden\n                    Season and Designer.SG have been mentioned in the emails, the thrust of the\n                    emails and in fact, the defamatory “sting” of the email appears to\n                    be centred on how Tedric has allegedly cheated both Mercy Relief and the\n                    Defendants in his dealings with them. It is also apparent that these allegations\n                    arose in the context of Tedric being the “Entrepreneur from\n                    Designer.SG” and “the Marketing Director of Golden\n                    Season”. 119    The question before me therefore, is whether\n                    as a result of this, the First and Second Plaintiff are also defamed. Taking a\n                    plain and ordinary reading of the defamatory material, would the defamatory\n                    sting reasonably refer to Golden Season and Designer.SG? 120    The point has been made earlier that it is\n                    necessary that the defamatory words are understood as referring to the\n                    Plaintiffs. It follows that a company will not be able to maintain an action for\n                    defamation if the defamatory words refer to the officers or members of a company\n                    and not the company. The case ofDuke v University of\n                        Salford[2013] EWHC 196 (QB) is illustrative. The defendant had\n                    published a blog whereby members of the public or students of the plaintiff\n                    university were encouraged to make contributions to an ongoing discussion either\n                    anonymously or by way of pseudonyms. One of the main functions of the blog was\n                    to provide a platform for criticism of various aspects of the University's\n                    administration. Two individuals of the university administration were often\n                    singled out. The defendant applied to have the action struck out. The\n                    application was dismissed. He appealed, maintaining that the defamatory words as\n                    found in the blog were not in reference to the university, but to certain\n                    individuals, and therefore, the university could not maintain the action. The\n                    appeal was allowed, and the action struck out, the court finding that “in\n                    substance and reality, this [was] an action about allegations against\n                    individuals rather than against the University itself”. 121    That is not to say that a company cannot be\n                    defamed when its officers have been defamed. Much will depend on exactly what\n                    the officer was defamed of. As stated at para 8.17 ofGatley: To take an extreme case, a trading company could clearly have no action in\n                        respect of a statement imputing sexual promiscuity to its managing director\n                        or alleging that he had murdered his wife. Where the imputation concerns a\n                        “business” matter more difficult questions of degree will\n                        arise but the extent to which the person directly defamed controls the\n                        company and can therefore be regarded as itsalter\n                            egowill be a relevant consideration. [Emphasis in\n                        original] 122    This is also reflected in the decision ofBargold Pty Ltd v Mirror Newspapers Ltd &\n                        Anor[1981] 1 NSWLR 9, where Hunt J at 10 said: … where such matter reflects solely upon a director or an officer\n                        of a company, the company itself cannot complain of its publication, but the\n                        emphasis must be placed upon the word ‘solely’:Bognor Regis Urban District Council v\n                        Campion[1972] 2 QB 169 at p. 175.  However,\n                        an imputation concerning such a director or officer may in many cases\n                        reflect also upon the company itself; whether it may or does must depend\n                        upon the part that director or officer is alleged to have played in the\n                        operations of the company and upon the extent to which the one is identified\n                        with or considered to be the alter ego of the other. 123    InHunt Australia Pty Ltd\n                        v Davidsons’ Arnhem Land Safaris Pty Ltd(2000) 179 ALR 738\n                        (“Hunt Australia”), the Managing\n                    Director of the plaintiff company was said to be a liar. The judge at first\n                    instance held that the plaintiff company was also defamed by virtue of the fact\n                    that the Managing Director was thealter egoof\n                    the company – he and his company were so closely linked in the industry\n                    that they were identified as one and the same. An attack on the character and\n                    integrity of the Managing Director was therefore an attack on the character and\n                    integrity of the plaintiff company. On appeal, the court agreed with the\n                    findings of the judge at first instance, holding that it was a fair and\n                    reasonable reading of the defamatory words, such that the plaintiff company was\n                    also defamed. In so holding, the court relied on the decision inBargold, where Hunt J at 10 said: The article identifies the plaintiff company as being the ‘latest\n                        venture’ of Mr Alexander Barton who, it is said, runs the company with\n                        his son, Thomas Barton.  A great deal of attention is paid by the\n                        article to Mr Alexander Barton personally.  It is argued by the\n                        defendants that matter disparaging of Mr Barton is irrelevant to the\n                        question of what is disparaging of the plaintiff company.  I\n                        accept that where such matter reflects solely upon a director or an officer\n                        of a company, the company itself cannot complain of its publication, but the\n                        emphasis must be placed upon the word solely … However, an imputation\n                        concerning such a director or officer may in many cases reflect also upon\n                        the company itself …” 124    Applying this to the facts before me, I am\n                    of the view that the email chain is capable of referring to Tedric as well as\n                    Golden Season, but (with a few exceptions) not to Designer.SG. Throughout the\n                    emails, it was either expressly mentioned or implied that Tedric was a cheat,\n                    had committed a breach of trust, and was dishonest. It is also accepted that\n                    Golden Season was the main vehicle through which Tedric had made his purchases\n                    from the Defendants and his donations to Mercy Relief and SRC. I am also of the\n                    view that Mercy Relief was used to seeing Tedric and Golden Season synonymously,\n                    in that they were so commonly associated with each other. This is to be\n                    contrasted with Designer.SG, which is a relatively young (new) company and which\n                    is hardly mentioned at all in the chain of emails. As a result, I am of the view\n                    that Tedric and Golden Season have been defamed by the chain of emails, insofar\n                    as the references to the character of Tedric would be imputed onto Golden Season\n                    as a company being operated by Tedric. As such, Tedric and Golden Season can\n                    claim for damages. 125    For completeness, the Court notes that\n                    Designer.SG was mentioned in some of the emails. These include Email 3 which\n                    states that Roy thought he had dealt with Tedric of Designer.SG and mentions\n                    that some bills had not been paid by Tedric of Designer.SG. Similarly in Email\n                    4, it is again stated that Roy thought he was dealing at the outset with Tedric\n                    of Designer.SG. The crux of the passing references to Designer.SG is that when\n                    Roy first dealt with Tedric his understanding was that Tedric was acting in his\n                    position as a director of Designer.SG. It will be recalled that Designer.SG was\n                    a new company that was in the home décor business. Golden Season, on the other\n                    hand, was a much more established company dealing in military and humanitarian\n                    relief products. Tedric was the Sales Director of Golden Season. 126    It is clear that Mercy Relief and other\n                    charitable organisations dealt with Golden Season for supplies of relief\n                    products such as ready to go meals and the like. Even if the statement that\n                    Tedric of Designer.SG had outstanding bills with the Defendants is a direct\n                    reference to the Second Plaintiff, I am not satisfied that the other imputations\n                        (ie, cheating or improper business practices)\n                    extend beyond Tedric and Golden Season. 127    To be clear, Email 4 states that: We will still extend our inflatable products to your NGO at corporate\n                        rates directly for future flood disaster relief and will not deal withtedric lingfrom Designer.Sg as he has\n                        also not paid for some of the items still owed to my company. [emphasis added] This statement on its own and in the context of the email as a\n                    whole is directed at Tedric Ling, the Third Plaintiff. 128    Email 6 states,inter\n                        alia, that: I have never mention [sic] that we sold to\n                        your organization nor copied from your website. It was given by designer.sg\n                        to me by email and yet Tedric did this much later on…. ( was it with\n                        your permission ??) The Statement of Claim pleads that Email 6 is defamatoryinter aliabecause it meant that Designer.SG\n                    “gave the Defendants permission to use MR photographs in breach of\n                    MR’s copyright.” I do not agree that this is the natural inference\n                    to be drawn. Email 6 is directed largely at the First Plaintiff and contains the\n                    statement that Golden Season should be warned not to use the photographs taken\n                    with the Thai Prime Minister. 129    Email 7 is pleaded as containinginter aliathe statement that Tedric had begun his\n                    discussions as a representative of his furniture company whereas it is now\n                    Golden Season. I do not agree that the implication behind this is that the\n                    Second Plaintiff gave the Defendants permission to commit copyright\n                    infringement. 130    Email 8 as pleaded containsinter aliastatements essentially to the effect that the\n                    Defendants thought Tedric was dealing in his capacity as an officer of\n                    Designer.SG and that they will still claim from Designer.SG until they pay up.\n                    Email 8 is pleaded as defamatory of Designer.SG in that it means it owes\n                    outstanding debts. Other statements are said to be defamatory in that they\n                    suggest Designer.SG gave permission to use photographs in breach of Mercy\n                    Relief’s copyright. In so far as the sting of debts is concerned, I am of\n                    the view that this statement is primarily directed towards Tedric and Golden\n                    Season. The same is true of the second sting. 131    In any case, I note in passing that even if\n                    there is a defamatory meaning directed at Designer.SG, namely that Designer.SG\n                    is not able to meet its debts or that it was experiencing some financial\n                    difficulties, there is little evidence that this has resulted in any loss or\n                    damage to Designer.SG or that its business reputation has been damaged in any\n                    manner. Indeed looking at the few references to Designer.SG and unpaid bills and\n                    photographs in the context of the emails as a whole I am not satisfied that the\n                    statement would lower the standing of Designer.SG as opposed to\n                Tedric.",
        "Quantum of damages": "132    I now turn to the quantum of damages that is\n                    to be awarded to the First Plaintiff and the Third Plaintiff, Golden Season and\n                    Tedric respectively. For ease of reference, I refer to them as the\n                    “Plaintiffs” save where necessary to deal with their claims\n                    separately. 133    Counsel for the Plaintiffs sought to\n                    persuade me that damages awarded should not be limited to general damages but\n                    should also include aggravated and exemplary damages. General damages in libel\n                    actions are meant to vindicate the plaintiff's reputation as well as to afford\n                    compensatory redress for injury to the plaintiff's reputation and\n                    feelings. 134    As discussed above, it is clear that a\n                    company can claim for general damages for injury caused to its business\n                    reputation. Leaving aside claims for consequential damage (loss of business) it\n                    has been said that a company is unlikely to be entitled to a really substantial\n                    award of damages (seeGatley 2013at para 9.17).\n                    Much of course will depend on whether the defamation has injured the business\n                    goodwill of the company such that the business reputation of the company can\n                    only be vindicated by a “really substantial award”. In many cases,\n                    it may be that in the absence of sufficient proof that the company has suffered\n                    loss of business the award to the company whilst more than nominal will be\n                    “small in commercial terms”. 135    Counsel for the Plaintiffs, however,\n                    submitted that a company can claim for aggravated damages, in so far as the\n                    position at law was not clear, relying on the decision of the Court of the\n                    Appeal inBasil Anthony Herman v Premier Security\n                        Co-operative Ltd and others[2010] 3 SLR 110, where at [65], it\n                    was opined that: Only an individual can claim damages for distress. A corporate or business\n                        entity can only recover damages appropriate for vindication and (if pleaded)\n                        special damages for loss of business and goodwill. We also note that the\n                        ability of a corporate plaintiff to recover aggravated damages for\n                        defamation has not been authoritatively settled (see,eg, the contrasting positions taken in the English\n                        High Court cases ofMessenger Newspapers Group Ltd v\n                            National Graphical Association[1984] IRLR 397\n                            andCollins Stewart v The Financial Times\n                            Ltd[2005] EWHC 262). 136    I am not persuaded that a corporate entity\n                    can or should be awarded aggravated damages. It is common understanding that\n                    aggravated damages are awarded for injury to feelings and pride in circumstances\n                    where the Defendant’s conduct has aggravated the injury. Aggravated\n                    damages in this sense remain compensatory in nature, albeit in the nature of a\n                    more generous compensatory award. Even though the conduct of the defendant\n                    (exceptional or contumelious behaviour or motive) is an important consideration,\n                    the purpose of aggravated damages remains compensation and not punishment.\n                    Punishment falls within the domain of exemplary damages (see the English Law\n                    Commission's Report on Aggravated, Exemplary and Restitutionary Damages (Law Com\n                    No 247, 1997)). 137    It is hard to see how, on this basis,\n                    aggravated damages are applicable to a corporate entity. Whilst the English High\n                    Court inMessenger Newspapers Group Ltd v National Graphical\n                        Association[19984] 1 All ER 293 (“Messenger Newspapers”) case awarded aggravated damages to\n                    a corporate plaintiff, the Court there was more concerned with the need to\n                    punish the defendant for his deliberate wrong doing (see alsoGatley 2013at para 9.20). On this basis,Messenger Newspapersis really a decision onexemplarydamages rather thanaggravateddamages. Indeed, the court inMessenger Newspapersmade clear that the award was not in\n                    respect of injury to feelings. 138    In any case, as will be discussed below, in\n                    my view the losses suffered by the First Plaintiff can be adequately compensated\n                    with an award of general damages. 139    In deciding the quantum of damages, the\n                    comments of the Court of Appeal inLee Hsien Loong v\n                        Singapore Democratic Party and others and another suit[2009] 1\n                    SLR(R) 642 at [72] and [73] are instructive: 72    … Relevant factors would include the gravity\n                            of the libel (eg, allegations relating to\n                            the integrity or the truthfulness of a plaintiff are amongst the most\n                            serious), the extent of the circulation of the libel and any repetition\n                            of it. The court has to take into account any mitigating features and\n                            any relevant aggravating conduct on the part of the defendant.\n                            Retraction or apology, if any, is a matter tending to\n                            mitigate damages. Malice of the defendant, in contrast, is an\n                            aggravating factor. Also of relevance is the conduct of the plaintiff\n                            and his standing in society. Equally, the defendant's conduct of the\n                            proceedings and at the trial itself might be a basis for aggravating or\n                            increasing the damages awarded to redress the injury to the\n                            plaintiff's feelings. In that connection, the court will generally\n                            consider the chronology of the entire proceedings so as to see to what\n                            extent (if any) the defendant's conduct should impact upon the\n                            compensation to be awarded to the plaintiff. 73     Lastly, the size of the award has to be an\n                        amount that represents a fair and reasonable sum commensurate with or\n                        proportionate to the damage which the plaintiff has suffered to his\n                        reputation, standing and good name. It will also have to be a sum that\n                        sufficiently vindicates his reputation (seeCassell\n                            & Co Ltd v Broome[1972] AC 1027 at\n                        1071, per Lord Hailsham of St Marylebone LC). To this end, the\n                        court will look at the corpus of past awards for comparison or guidance.\n                        Broadly appropriate comparable cases can, if used with discretion, provide\n                        some guidance on the appropriate amount of damages to award in a\n                        particular case. This approach is especially useful in promoting a\n                        rationally sustainable and coherent regime for damages for libel,\n                        and, as a corollary, in avoiding \"the grossly exorbitant awards so often\n                        made by juries in other jurisdictions\" (per Thean JA inTang Liang Hong(CA) ([21] supra) at\n                        [158]). Notably, in making that remark, Thean JA was not in any way\n                        suggesting that, in adopting this approach, damages should be\n                        capped. That would be quite unrealistic, given the factual diversity\n                        of defamation cases. But, the fact that\n                        the damages awarded in previous cases inevitably depend on the\n                        facts and circumstances of each individual case is not a reason for\n                        rejecting the use of case precedents as comparables. In other words, the\n                        award of damages made in a case comparable to the case at hand is\n                        not sacrosanct, but it can hardly be thought to be irrelevant. The\n                        impression gathered from a review of the past awards in local cases is that\n                        the increase in damages seen in the cases is largely linked to the\n                        nature and the number of aggravating factors present in a particular case\n                        and, to an extent, the change in the purchasing power of money over the\n                        decades. 140    The factors that can be taken into account\n                    are numerous, some of which are touched on in para 9.5 ofGatley 2013, and include: …the conduct of the claimant, his credibility, his position and\n                        standing and the subjective impact that the libel has had on him, the nature\n                        of the libel, its gravity and the mode and extent of its publication, the\n                        absence or refusal of any retraction or apology, and the conduct of the\n                        defendant from the time when the libel was published down to the\n                        verdict. 141    Although the email chain is defamatory of\n                    the Plaintiffs and, to a certain extent, touched upon the Plaintiffs’\n                    honesty (in particular Tedric), it was framed in a very particular context, this\n                    being the acquisition of the boats for flood relief and the donation of the two\n                    boats (from Kairos) in this specific episode. As for the standing of the\n                    Plaintiffs, I note that Tedric has some reputation in the business world in\n                    Singapore. I also note that Golden Season is a 30-year old company of some\n                    repute, especially given its involvement in charity work. The Plaintiffs have\n                    asserted that the email chain was published to a number of other recipients\n                    apart from Mercy Relief, given that it was addressed to “friends and\n                    clients of Kairos Inflatables”[note: 41]. However, the Plaintiffs have\n                    not produced further evidence to substantiate this, and based on the email\n                    subject title alone and my observation of the demeanour of the witnesses, I am\n                    not prepared to find that the email chain was senten\n                        masseto a large number of people. 142    As found above, I am satisfied, however,\n                    that the Second Defendant had malicious intent in writing the chain of emails.\n                    That is an aggravating factor to be taken into account when deciding the quantum\n                    of damages. Although there may have been some grounds for suspicion and\n                    unhappiness over the slow responses he was receiving, the Second Defendant, a\n                    mature businessman, had chosen to pursue his suspicions relentlessly without\n                    even bothering to communicate or check with the Plaintiffs. I am of the view\n                    that his pursuit of the truth was done with the intention of hurting Tedric as\n                    one the objectives. At the very least, the emails were sent in a reckless\n                    manner. To this extent, I am of the view that the chain of emails indeed bore a\n                    semblance of a personal “witch-hunt” by the Second Defendant (seeArul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik Victor[2001] 1\n                    SLR(R) 86 at [48]). I was also not impressed that in raising their defence, the\n                    Defendants chose to bring up Hassan’s past, which is, in my view,\n                    exceptionally irrelevant for the purposes of this trial. I also note that no\n                    apology has been extended by the Defendants to the Plaintiffs. 143    I took into account the following cases\n                    where the award of damages ranged from $20,000 to $80,000 (A\n                        Balakrishnan v Nirumalan K Pillay[1999] 2 SLR(R) 462\n                        (“Balakrishnan”),Ei-Nets Ltd v Yeo Nai Meng[2004] 1 SLR(R) 153\n                        (“Ei-Nets Ltd”),TJ System (S) Pte Ltd v Ngow Kheong Shen (No 2)[2003]\n                    SGHC 217 (“TJ System”),Oei Hong Leong v Ban Song Long David[2005] 3 SLR(R) 608\n                        (“Oei Hong Leong”)). A brief\n                    summary of the material facts for these cases in tabular form is as\n                    follows: CaseFactsAwardBalakrishnanThere were a number\n                                            plaintiffs from either the legal industry, computer\n                                            industry or the education industry. A defamatory article\n                                            was released in a Tamil magazine, and an estimated 8,000\n                                            copies were sold.The award was $20,000 or\n                                            $30,000 for various plaintiffs.Ei-Nets\n                                                LtdThe plaintiff was a director\n                                            and businessman who was in charge of certain financial\n                                            decisions of a company. Pursuant to an audit of these\n                                            decisions, three reports were released, accusing the\n                                            plaintiff of fraud and dishonesty.

I also considered the principles laid down by the\n                    Court of Appeal inLim Eng Hock Peter v Lin Jian Wei and\n                        another and another appeal[2010] 4 SLR 357. 145    In the present case, the Third Plaintiff,\n                    while a respectable businessman, was not a “public figure”. Also,\n                    the extent of publication was low. Not only was the extent of publication low\n                    – it was primarily to Mercy Relief as an organisation. Taking all this\n                    into consideration and bearing in mind that the award of damages should be\n                    commensurate to the damage suffered by a plaintiff, I was of the view that the\n                    quantum of damages to be awarded would be largely similar to the awards in the\n                    above mentioned cases. I award the First Plaintiff $15,000 for the injury done\n                    to its business reputation. In the case of Tedric, the Third Plaintiff, I award\n                    him $30,000 by way of general damages for the injury to his reputation and the\n                    consequential injury to his feelings and dignity. Considering the presence of\n                    malice as well as the manner in which the events unfolded, I further award the\n                    Third Plaintiff aggravated damages of $20,000. The total amount of damages\n                    awarded to the Plaintiffs is, therefore, $65,000. 146    For completeness, I did not find that an\n                    award for exemplary damages was appropriate for this case. Whilst exemplary\n                    damages can be awarded, they are only recoverable “where compensatory\n                    damages after taking account all the circumstances of aggravation, remain an\n                    insufficient punishment” – seeClerk and\n                        Lindsell on Torts(Michael A Jones gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell,\n                    20th Ed, 2010) (\"Clerk and Lindsell on Torts\") at\n                    para 22-231. Important factors include proof that the defendant at the time of\n                    publication was aware that he was committing the tort (or was acting recklessly)\n                    and still proceeded because of his hope of material gain. Whilst the Court\n                    accepts that the Defendants were competitors of the Plaintiffs at the time the\n                    defamatory emails were sent, I am not satisfied that an award of exemplary\n                    damages is justified or necessary to punish the Defendants over and above the\n                    award of compensatory and aggravated damages which I have discussed\n                    earlier.",
        "Loss of sales": "147    Counsel for the Plaintiffs argued that\n                    Golden Season should be awarded “general/special damages” in\n                    relation to the loss of sales that it suffered because of the defamation. To\n                    that end, a table detailing the loss in sales for Golden Season was exhibited as\n                        follows:[note: 42] YearMercy ReliefSRC2008$225,882.44$352,867.422009$205,588.13$87,250.002010$289,421.00$0.002011$2,387,343.45$89,676.002012$457,623.48$0.002013 till 15 June\n                                        2013$0.00$0.00   148    The above table, based on the statement of\n                    accounts to Mercy Relief and the SRC, was said to demonstrate the drop in sales\n                    between 2011 and 2012 and between 2011 and 2013. Mercy Relief and the SRC were\n                    major clients of Golden Season, and represented up to 25% of their annual sales\n                    for certain years. It was submitted that in 2013, orders from Mercy Relief and\n                    SRC had come to a “standstill”, and that Golden Season had\n                    suffered a loss of approximately $330,000 in total. 149    A plaintiff must be compensated by a\n                    defendant for a (financial) loss of business resulting from the wrongful\n                    commission of a tort. This is simply the law of damages in tort law – the\n                    compensation from the defendant is to redress and to right any loss suffered by\n                    the plaintiff, and to restore him to the position as if the tort was not\n                    committed. Equally so, the normal principles of causation and remoteness apply\n                    in deciding what damage the plaintiff is to be compensated for. The damage must\n                    flow from the wrongful commission of the tort, and cannot be too remote.\n                    Although there is some academic debate as to whether financial loss should fall\n                    under “general” or “special” damages, it is largely\n                    recognised that this can be claimed by the plaintiff. 150    In this case, based on the evidence before\n                    the Court, it does appear that sales from SRC and Mercy Relief reduced/stopped\n                    after the Plaintiffs started to get involved in litigation with the Defendants.\n                    However, the Plaintiffs must show that it isbecause of the\n                        defamatory publicationsby the Defendants which have led to the\n                    loss of sales. Where a claimant alleges that in consequence of being defamed by\n                    the defendant he has suffered special damage, it is always open to the latter to\n                    suggest that the damage in question is attributable to other causes (seeClerk & Lindsell on Tortsat para 22-236).\n                    While there is no need to prove that SRC and Mercy Relief believed that the\n                    defamatory publications were true (seeLynch v\n                        Knight(1861) 9 HLC 577 andSlipper v\n                        BBC[1991] QB 283), it must be proved that it was because the\n                    Plaintiffs were defamed, and not because of some other reason, such as economic\n                    conditions for example, that a loss or fall in sales occurred. 151    To this end, the evidence of SRC and Mercy\n                    Relief is critical in understanding exactlywhyorders had stopped.[note: 43]When questioned as to why\n                    there were no orders placed with Golden Season, Hassan had answered that they\n                    wanted to be more “cautious” and to see “how this case\n                    turns out”. Hassan continually stressed that he kept telling Golden\n                    Season that he did “not want to be involved in this, and especially that\n                    period of time in October/November/December of 2011 and 2012”. According\n                    to Hassan, this was a very crucial and critical time for the humanitarian sector\n                    in the region. Under cross-examination, Hassan was asked whether the opinion of\n                    the Plaintiffs had changed as a result of this episode. In reply, Hassan\n                    maintained that he always has been grateful to Golden Season for all the\n                    support, but reiterated that he was not appreciative of being “dragged\n                    into this whole commercial dispute”. 152    Considering the evidence, I am not convinced\n                    that the sales from the SRC and Mercy relief dropped because of the defamatory\n                    publications, whether it is because SRC and Mercy Relief believed that they were\n                    true, or because they did not want to associate themselves with the Plaintiffs\n                    who had been defamed. In my view, the SRC and Mercy Relief had chosen to stop\n                    orders from the Plaintiffs because of complications arising from the litigation\n                    and the souring of the relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants,\n                    one of its former suppliers. 153    As testified by Hassan, Mercy Relief was\n                    reluctant to get involved in the whole affair. It is, therefore, understandable\n                    that the organisations might turn to other suppliers for their necessary\n                    equipment. To this end, it is also telling that for 2012, Golden Season recorded\n                    $457,623.48 of sales from Mercy Relief, which is approximately twice the amount\n                    of sales recorded for each of the years from 2008 to 2010. Given that the\n                    “defamatory campaign” of the Defendants was from end 2011 to early\n                    2012, this further reinforces the assessment that the drop in sales was not\n                    attributable to the publication of the defamatory statements. Despite the\n                    publications, Mercy Relief still placed orders with Golden Season in 2012. I\n                    also note that in 2010, the SRC did not place any orders with Golden Season. Why\n                    this was so was not explained. Therefore, without further evidence proving\n                    otherwise, I find that the fact that the SRC did not place orders with Golden\n                    Season from 2012 and the first half of 2013 cannot be solely attributed to the\n                    defamatory publications of the Defendant. Indeed, I note in passing that the\n                    evidence on the details as to the sales figures (Tables aside) was rather thin.\n                    In this case therefore, I am not prepared to find that the loss in sales were\n                    caused by the defamatory publications of the Defendants (namely, the email\n                    chain), and therefore, do not award damages for the alleged financial loss\n                    suffered by Golden Season. 154    In reaching this decision on the claim for\n                    loss of sales, the decision of the Court of Appeal inLow\n                        Tuck Kwong v Sukamto Sia[2014] 1 SLR 639 (“Sukamto Sia”) was instructive. In that case, VK\n                    Rajah JA (as he then was) for the Court of Appeal accepted (at [94]) that as a\n                    general proposition, a plaintiff is not precluded from claiming special damages\n                    in an action for defamation on top of a claim for general damage. It did not\n                    follow, however, that all consequential pecuniary loss was recoverable. The\n                    Court of Appeal also pointed out (at [96]) that in defamation cases, the\n                    propensity was for the plaintiff to claim damage to reputation: as general\n                    damagestout court. This was because a claim for\n                    special damages is also limited to a claim in respect of losses referable to the\n                    damage to reputation. Further, it was held (at [98]) that where the loss\n                    resulting from publication of the words complained of is not referable to the\n                    protected interest (reputation), the loss is not claimable even if the\n                    publication was factually causative of it. In the present case, the evidence\n                    supports the view that Mercy Relief and SRC likely reduced or stopped placement\n                    of orders because of the business dispute between the Plaintiffs and Defendants\n                    and not because of the defamatory statementsper\n                        se.",
        "Conclusion on defamation": "155    To summarise, I find that the\n                    Plaintiffs’ claim in defamation with regards to the email chain succeeds.\n                    The First Plaintiff (Golden Season) is awarded $15,000 for the injury done to\n                    its business reputation. The Third Plaintiff (Tedric) is awarded $30,000 by way\n                    of general damages and $20,000 by way of aggravated damages. The total amount of\n                    damages awarded to the Plaintiffs is, therefore, $65,000. 156    For the avoidance of doubt, I note that the\n                    defamatory email chain was authored by the 2ndDefendant. It is clear that this was done in his personal capacityandas the director of the\n                        1stDefendant. InThe Law of\n                        Torts in Singaporeat [18.014], the point is made that “as\n                    an artificial entity, the acts of a corporation are performed by its employees\n                    or officers or directors. Acts of such persons may be attributed to the\n                    corporation. The act of a person regarded as the directing mind and will of the\n                    corporation would generally be regarded as the act of the corporation\n                    itself”. In any case, none of the parties have drawn any distinction\n                    between the 1stand 2ndDefendants. 157    Before moving on to discuss the\n                    Defendants’ counterclaim in copyright infringement and passing off, I deal\n                    with the Plaintiffs’ parallel claim in malicious falsehood.",
        "Malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the Defamation Act": "158    Apart from the claim in defamation, the\n                    Plaintiffs also raised the tort of malicious falsehood and s 6(1) of the\n                    Defamation Act (Cap 75, 2014 Rev Ed) (“DA”). Section 6(1) of the\n                    DA reads as follows: Slander of title,\n                        etc. 6.—(1)  In any action for slander of title,\n                        slander of goods or other malicious falsehood, it shall not be necessary to\n                        allege or prove special damage — (a) if the words upon which the action\n                            is founded are calculated to cause pecuniary damage to the plaintiff and\n                            are published in writing or other permanent form. 159    Under common law, to succeed in a claim in\n                    malicious falsehood, the plaintiff must prove: (a)     that the defendant published to\n                        third parties words which are false; (b)     that they refer to the claimant or his property or his\n                        business; (c)     that\n                        they were published maliciously; and (d)     that special damage has followed as a direct and natural\n                        result of their publication.

The\n                        textual information was largely concerned with the specifications of the\n                        boat: its dimensions, weight, seating capacity etc. The main heading was\n                        entitled “Inflatable Sampan built for Fishing, Rescue, Leisure &\n                        Military Use.” The Defendants contact details were set out at the\n                        bottom of the page.

(c)S/n 3 Brochure for\n                            “Electric Pump”– This comprised two\n                        photographs of the pump in use together with specifications and a brief\n                        description of what the pump could be used for by means of seven bullet\n                        points. The brochure also set out the Defendants contact details and\n                        displayed the Kairos Brand in a prominent position. (d)S/n 4 Picture for\n                            KB 430– This brochure (single page) bore another\n                        photograph of the inflatable boat under the description “Crossover\n                        between a Kayak and Boat!” The brochure set out the technical\n                        specifications as well as a brief description of the boat. There was also a\n                        photograph of an outboard motor branded “Makara” with the\n                        words that the Makara 2 stroke outboard engine was recommended. The\n                        Defendants contact details were set out at the bottom of the page with the\n                        Kairos Brand. (e)S/n 5 Brochure for Makara Engine–\n                        These comprised enlarged photographs of the Makara branded outboard engines\n                        (of varying power) as well the specifications in a table form. The brochure\n                        included at the top the Makara Brand as well as the Kairos\n                    Brand.",
        "Originality and authorship": "169    I deal with a preliminary issue at the\n                    outset, which is whether the Defendants can claim to be the owner of the\n                    copyright in the works. Two points arise. First, are the works original? Second,\n                    are the Defendants the copyright owners? 170    According to the Defendants, the photographs\n                    listed at S/n 2 and S/n 4 in the table above were taken by Roy himself. The\n                    brochures listed at S/n 1, S/n 3 and S/n 5 in the table above (collectively\n                    referred to as “the brochures”) were said to be designed by an\n                    employee of the Defendants known as Kushastha Tharusha Peiris\n                        (“Kusha”).[note: 44]On the other hand, the Plaintiffs\n                    argued that the Defendants had copied “word for word” some of the\n                    specifications of their boats from another company in the USA, Saturn\n                        Inflatables.[note: 45] 171    The Plaintiffs tendered samples of the\n                    marketing material of Saturn Inflatables to demonstrate the similarities with\n                    the copyright works. Some similarities alluded to include: (a)Between the\n                            Defendants’ brochure for KB 437 Crossover between Kayak and Boat\n                            and Saturn Inflatables’ and Saturn Inflatable SK 430\n                            webpage– the exact wording of the phrases “wide\n                        beam hull design for stability. You can stand in a “KaBoat”,\n                        “Front Spray Skirt with water deflector guard and rope\n                        lacing”, “Marine grade plywood transom with a one way drain\n                        plug” and “Included: hand pump, repair kit, 2 oars and carry\n                        bag”. (b)Between S/n 1 brochure for KB 528 XL and Saturn\n                            Inflatables’ SK487XL webpage– the technical\n                        specifications are the same and the exact use of the wording of the phrase\n                        “Included: hand pump, repair kit, 2 oars and carry\n                        bag”. (c)Between S/n 3 and Saturn Inflatables’\n                            Electrical Pump webpage– a list of other products\n                        which the electrical pump would be perfect for, with some minor adjustments,\n                        as well as the specifications of the product. 172    For completeness, I would add that the\n                    Plaintiffs did not appear to contest the originality of the photographs, that is\n                    to say the pictures listed at S/n 2 and S/n 4 and the photographs used in S/n 1,\n                    S/n 3 and S/n 5 in the table above, thereby accepting that the Defendants had\n                    indeed taken the photographs. In any case, a perusal of the marketing material\n                    of Saturn Inflatables does not show similar photographs. Furthermore, I also\n                    note that the Plaintiffs did not seem to adduce any evidence that showed that\n                    the S/n 5 had been copied. Indeed whilst the evidence could have been clearer,\n                    the Defendants’ case was that Roy had instructed his employee to produce\n                    the brochure. 173    According to the Plaintiffs, these\n                    similarities should be taken into account in considering the Defendants’\n                    claim in copyright infringement. The point behind this assertion may have been\n                    to challenge whether the brochures were original works in which copyright could\n                    subsist in the first place (although this was not clear from the pleadings). I\n                    pause here to add that the similarities might also be relevant in determining\n                    whether the Plaintiffs had copied a substantial part of the Defendants’\n                    copyright works if these were indeed found to be original. 174    To the extent that the Plaintiffs are\n                    challenging originality, I do not find merit in the Plaintiffs’ argument.\n                    Whilst the Plaintiffs assert that the specifications and text material set out\n                    in the Defendants brochures’ were substantially the same and copied from\n                    Saturn Inflatables, I am satisfied that the Defendants’ brochures are, as\n                    a whole, original works in which copyright subsists. It is important to note\n                    that it is each brochureas a wholethat the\n                    Defendants assert copyright in. The question is whether each brochure as a whole\n                    is an original literary work. The fact that some parts may be copied from\n                    elsewhere does not mean that the work as a whole lacks originality for copyright\n                    purposes. 175    During cross-examination, Roy was questioned\n                    on the above-mentioned similarities. He testified that all he had done was to\n                    instruct his employee Kusha to design the brochure using his original\n                    photographs – he did not tell Kusha to copy anything.[note: 46]Whilst this may be so, this does not necessarily\n                    mean that any copyright in the copied Saturn Inflatables material was not\n                    infringed. I say no more on this since there is no claim by Saturn Inflatables\n                    for infringement and there is no need for me to pronounce on this. 176    Kusha was not called to give evidence. I\n                    also note that whilst the specifications were largely similar to those in the\n                    Saturn Inflatables material (where they were also listed in a Table), Roy had\n                    explained (during cross-examination) that the specifications were also available\n                    from his supplier Rongcheng. The point behind this appears to be that the\n                    similarities in the specifications did not necessarily mean that the Defendants\n                    had copied the information from Saturn Inflatables. Nevertheless, given the\n                    exact phrases used (as set out above), the Plaintiffs’ position is that\n                    the Defendants must have copied some of the information and specifications from\n                    Saturn Inflatables’ material. 177    The difficulty for the Plaintiffs, however,\n                    is that even if this was the position, it does not follow that the\n                    Defendants’ brochures were lacking in originality as a whole. Whilst this\n                    information (the specifications) was available on a webpage for Saturn\n                    Inflatables, the information in the Defendants’ works was presented in the\n                    form of brochures. Although the specifications might be the same, the brochures\n                    were clearly designed to promote information to consumers in a different way.\n                    Take for example the Defendants’ brochure for KB528XL[note: 47](S/n 1 in the table\n                    above) compared against Saturn Inflatables’ webpage for\n                        SK487XL.[note: 48]The Defendants’ brochure is a one page\n                    brochure with two tables presenting the technical specifications of the product.\n                    There is a single picture of the product, and its main features are listed in\n                    point form. On the other hand, Saturn Inflatables’ webpage for SK487XL is\n                    largely in prose form, contains customer reviews and has numerous videos and\n                    photographs of the boat. It is by far more comprehensive then the\n                    Defendants’ brochure. Comparing the two, I am more than satisfied that\n                    while some information is the same, it is clearly being promoted and presented\n                    in a different way. 178    The evidence was that the photographs were\n                    taken by the Defendants and the Defendants’ brochures were designed (in\n                    terms of the organisation and presentation of the information) by the\n                    Defendants. While the brochures as a whole may have been simple, simplicityper sedoes not prevent a work from acquiring\n                    copyright. All that is needed is that the author created it and has not\n                    slavishly copied it from another (seeAuvi Pte Ltd v Seah\n                        Siew Tee[1991] 2 SLR(R) 786). For completeness, I also accept\n                    the Defendants’ claim that the individual photographs are original\n                    artistic works in their own right. 179    For this reason, I am satisfied that the\n                    Defendants’ photographs and brochures were original works in which\n                    copyright subsisted. The works were produced by the Second Defendant and an\n                    employee (Kusha) who was acting in the course of his employment.",
        "Infringement by the Plaintiffs": "180    In order for the Defendants to succeed on\n                    the counterclaim for copyright infringement, it is necessary to demonstrate that\n                    the Plaintiffs had indeed reproduced a substantial part of the copyright work\n                    without the licence of the copyright owner. This is a two-stage inquiry. Did the\n                    Plaintiffs copy from the copyright works? If so, was the material copied a\n                    substantial part of the copyright work? 181    Turning to the question of copying, it is\n                    well established that what is required is sufficient proof of a causal\n                    connection between the copyright works and the alleged infringements. The\n                    question as to whether the alleged copyist was consciously aware of the\n                    connection is irrelevant. In the absence of an admission of copying, the\n                    beginning of proof normally lies in establishing similarity together with proof\n                    of access (opportunity to copy) (seeLB Plastics Ltd v Swish\n                        Products Ltd[1979] RPC 551 at 619 andCreative Technology Ltd v Aztech Systems Pte Ltd[1997] 1 SLR\n                    621 at 634). 182    In this case, it is clear that that there\n                    are many significant points of similarity between the copyright works and the\n                    Modified Brochures. For example, the Plaintiffs’ brochure promoting its\n                    “3 – 4 Man Inflatable Rescue Boat” was almost exactly the\n                    same as the Defendants’ brochure for their boat KB 430 (“Crossover\n                    between Kayak and Boat”).[note: 49]Indeed, not only are these brochures almost the\n                    same in terms of informational content and arrangement it is to be noted that\n                    the Plaintiffs’ brochure sets out an almost identical reproduction of the\n                    Defendants’ photograph of KB 430 (S/n 4). 183    Similarly, a comparison between the\n                    Plaintiffs’ brochure for the 6-8 man inflatable boat shows a strong\n                    resemblance to the Defendants’ brochure for the KB 528XL (S/n 1). Even\n                    though there are some differences in terms of the branding and addresses it is\n                    noted that the details are the same. The photograph depicted in the\n                    Plaintiffs’ brochure is also very similar to the Defendants’\n                    photograph of KB 528XL (S/n 2). 184    Turning to the brochures for the electric\n                    pumps, however, I do not think that the brochures used by the Plaintiffs and the\n                    Defendants (S/n 3) are materially the same. The photographs used are different,\n                    and while the brochure for the Plaintiffs promotes the “Key\n                    Features” of the electrical pump, S/n 3 instead promotes the\n                    “Perfect product[s]” which the electrical pump can be used\n                    together with. 185    Finally, in the case of the brochure for the\n                    Makara engines “10 HP” (the Defendants’ brochure being S/n\n                    5), there is also strong similarity between the text as well as the depicted\n                    photograph of the engine. 186    From the above, it is clear that a number of\n                    the Modified Brochures clearly made use of the pictures of the Defendants’\n                    boats (S/n 2 and S/n 4 of the copyright works). These appear to have been\n                    digitally modified to suit the design of the Modified Brochures. In any case,\n                    Tedric during cross-examination had in fact admitted that the Plaintiffs had\n                    copied these from the Defendants.[note: 50] 187    Looking at the evidence as a whole, I am\n                    satisfied that the Plaintiffs had indeed copied from the Defendants’\n                    brochures and photographs. The question that remains is whether the taking was\n                    substantial such as to amount to infringement. 188    In deciding this, the Court notes the\n                    well-established principle that substantiality is generally determined on a\n                    qualitative basis. Copyright is concerned with protecting original expression\n                    and not basic facts. Further, what is in issue is whether what has been copied\n                    is a substantial part of the copyright work (as opposed to the infringing work).\n                    In determining this, the Court is entitled to bear in mind the relative\n                    simplicity of expression in the work. Copyright, after all, is about protecting\n                    original expression. 189    Although copyright subsists in the copyright\n                    works, the brochures basically set out the specifications of the products along\n                    with additional descriptions of some other features of the products and in some\n                    cases, addresses and contact details. It is apparent that in the case of the\n                    boats, much of the technical information was copied by the Defendants from\n                    Saturn Inflatables. That said, it would not be surprising if the products were\n                    generally from the same manufacturer or the same line of manufacturers that the\n                    specifications of the products would be largely similar. The copying of a part\n                    of a copyright work which is not original to the copyright work will not\n                    ordinarily be regarded as a substantial part of the copyright work. For this\n                    reason, if the question of infringement (substantiality) rested solely on the\n                    taking of the technical specifications of the boats, I doubt that a case of\n                    substantial taking would have been made out in the case of the brochures for the\n                    boats. The picture however changes, literally and metaphorically, when the\n                    photographs are taken into account. The Court has found that these were taken by\n                    Roy and were original artistic works in their own right. These photographs were\n                    clearly taken and used by the Plaintiffs. Accordingly, I find (leaving aside the\n                    question of licence) that a case of infringement has been made out in respect of\n                    the photographs for KB 430 and KB 528 XL. 190    In the case of the brochures for the Makara\n                    engine (S/n 5), it is noted that there is no evidence that the specifications\n                    and their arrangement in simple table form and the photographs were copied by\n                    the Defendants from elsewhere. That being so, I find on the evidence before me\n                    that the material taken from these brochures amounted to a substantial part of\n                    these works. It will be recalled that Roy’s evidence was that he had\n                    instructed Kusha to produce the brochures. 191    In the case of the brochures for the\n                    electric pump, as I had observed above, I did not find that there was any\n                    similarity between the brochure of the Plaintiffs and that of the Defendants. I,\n                    therefore, find that there was no copying of the brochures for the electric\n                    pump. 192    The main defence the Plaintiffs raise is to\n                    be found in their assertion that there was a verbal reseller agreement (as\n                    briefly stated above at [13] –[16]) between them and the Defendants, where\n                    it was agreed that the Plaintiffs could develop brochures of Kairos’\n                    products without their logo.[note: 51] 193    Copyright infringement only arises where the\n                    act of reproduction is done without the licence of the copyright owner. The\n                    issue that needs to be addressed is whether there was in fact a verbal reseller\n                    agreement and if so whether permission (to use the copyrighted works) was\n                    granted by the Defendants as part of this agreement. The legal burden of\n                    establishing that the act of copying was done without the licence of the\n                    copyright falls on the shoulders of the copyright owner. That said, Roy’s\n                    position is that no such licence or permission was granted to the Plaintiffs.\n                    The Plaintiffs, on the other hand, assert that a licence was indeed granted as\n                    part of the terms of an oral reseller agreement. To this end, oral evidence of\n                    the alleged agreement was led by the Plaintiffs. Whether or not this was in\n                    response to an evidential burden or otherwise, I am not satisfied that there was\n                    an oral reseller agreement as alleged or that, if there was, a licence to copy\n                    had been granted. 194    As briefly described above, according to the\n                    Plaintiffs, the verbal reseller agreement was reached at a meeting between the\n                    Plaintiffs and the Defendants that occurred after the Plaintiffs placed their\n                    second and third order with the Defendants and before 28 October 2011 (the date\n                    of the training session conducted by Francis). It was asserted that it was\n                    “verbally agreed that the marketing department of Golden Season could\n                    develop brochures of Kairos’ products”, and also that the\n                    Defendants had promised the Plaintiffs to remove their prices from the Internet\n                    to protect its resellers and not to post their prices on the Internet. In\n                    support of the existence of this agreement, the Plaintiffs argue that in a\n                    number of emails exchanged between the Defendants and them, the Defendants had\n                    used the term “reseller” in describing them.[note: 52] 195    Apart from the bare assertions made by the\n                    Plaintiffs, the only evidence that supports the Plaintiffs’ case is these\n                    emails. At the very best, some inferences might be drawn from how the business\n                    relationship between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants developed. As submitted\n                    by the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs were the Defendants’ “biggest\n                    customer at that time” and therefore according to the Plaintiffs an\n                    inference should be drawn that the Defendants would have agreed largely with\n                    their suggestion to allow the Plaintiffs to use the copyrighted works. The\n                    Plaintiffs also submit that it was only logical that the Defendants would have\n                    allowed this, if not, potential clients would go straight to the\n                    Defendants. 196    It might also be true that the Defendants\n                    had, to some extent, indicated their willingness to work with the Plaintiffs and\n                    to develop a formal reseller arrangement (exclusive or otherwise). To this end,\n                    some discussions may have taken place. However, there is no sufficient\n                    corroborating evidence suggesting such an agreement was made. Tedric himself\n                    could not remember exactly when this meeting occurred. Given that this was an\n                    agreement between two corporate entities conducted by two businessmen, both\n                    having some experience in the business world, it would only be reasonable to\n                    expect some documentary proof, be it in the form of emails, contemporaneous\n                    notes, call logs, or messages evidencing the existence of such an agreement.\n                    There, however, remains none of this. 197    Even then, as pointed out by the Defendants,\n                    an agreement to appoint the Plaintiffs as reseller is distinct and different\n                    from an agreement allowing the use of the copyrighted works. Taking the\n                    Plaintiffs’ case at its highest, the emails suggest that the Plaintiffs\n                    and Defendantsmayhave struck some form of\n                    agreementvis-à-visreselling the\n                    Defendants’ products. However, even if I am willing to find that there was\n                    an oral reseller agreement between the parties, that in itself lends little\n                    weight to the Plaintiffs’ arguments that there was an express agreement\n                    allowing them to use the copyrighted works. To be sure, an implied licence or an\n                    implied term granting such a licence would safeguard the Plaintiffs. That being\n                    said, however, there is little basis for such a finding. 198    I, therefore, find that the use and copying\n                    of the copyright works as discussed above were without the licence of the\n                    Defendant copyright owner and that the Defendants’ counterclaim in\n                    copyright infringement succeeds save in the case of the brochure for the\n                    pumps. 199    For purposes of completeness, and by way of\n                    passing comment, this would also mean that the Defendants can rely on the\n                    defence of justification in so far as the defamatory statements relate to the\n                    Plaintiffs infringing on their copyrights.",
        "The Defendants’ counterclaim in trademark\n                infringement": "200    Apart from a counterclaim in copyright\n                    infringement, the Defendants have also counterclaimed against the Plaintiffs for\n                    passing off. 201    It is noted that from the pleadings and\n                    submissions, it is not entirely clear exactly what the Defendants are asserting\n                    in respect of passing off. In their defence and counterclaim (Amendment No. 2)\n                    dated 30 August 2013, the Defendants plead that “the Plaintiffs\n                    misrepresented and/or passed off Kairos Boats [(Model No. KB 430 and KB 528XL)]\n                    as being associated with theFirst Defendant, when\n                    that was not the case.”[note: 53]The Defendants conclude by asking\n                    for an injunction against the Plaintiffs from “passing off the Passed Off\n                    Kairos Boats as being associated with theFirst\n                        Plaintiff”.[note: 54] 202    Nevertheless, it appears that the\n                    Defendants’ counterclaim is founded on the assertion that the Plaintiffs\n                    were “misrepresenting to the public that the Kairos boats were in fact\n                    Golden Season boats.” This can be discerned from the numerous examples\n                    raised by the Defendants, such as how the Plaintiffs had represented to the SRC\n                    that the boats used in the Thailand floods were boats of Golden Season, how the\n                    Plaintiffs had referenced a photo of Kairos boats with the Thai Prime Minister\n                    Yingluck as Golden Season Boats, and how the Plaintiffs had replaced\n                    Kairos’ trademarks in their brochures. In summary, as submitted by the\n                    Defendants, the Plaintiffs wanted to “pass off the Kairos business as\n                    being that of Golden Season.”[note: 55] 203    As an observation, I note that the\n                    Defendants’ pleadings (and submissions) rely only on the common law tort\n                    of passing off – there is no mention of or reliance on the Trade Marks Act\n                    (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed). The subsequent analysis therefore proceeds solely in\n                    respect of an action in passing off. 204    After considering the arguments of the\n                    parties, I find that the Plaintiffs are not liable for passing\n                off.",
        "Conclusion": "247    By way of conclusion, the Court recognises\n                    that the breakdown of the business relationship between the Third Plaintiff and\n                    the Second Defendant resulted in a bitter and emotionally charged dispute. The\n                    Court accepts that defamation actions will often be stressful: perhaps\n                    especially so where motives and intentions are called into question in the\n                    context of defences such as qualified privilege and indeed damages. For this\n                    reason, it is important that the evidence be confined to matters relevant to the\n                    dispute. Whilst some of the issues raised (such as the past history of Hassan of\n                    Mercy Relief) were unnecessary and indeed irrelevant to the case at hand, I\n                    acknowledge the professionalism, candour and courtesy counsel extended to each\n                    other during the hearings. While counsel robustly sought to establish their\n                    opposing legal positions, parties were generally cordial and there was no\n                    unnecessary delay in the proceedings. 248    The First Plaintiff succeeds in the action\n                    of defamation with regards to the email chain and is awarded S$15,000 in\n                    damages. The Third Plaintiff succeeds in the defamation action in respect of the\n                    email chain and is awarded in total S$50,000 in damages. 249    The Defendants’ counterclaim in\n                    copyright infringement (save for the pump brochure) succeeds, and the Plaintiffs\n                    are to surrender or to file and serve an affidavit affirming the destruction of\n                    the Modified Brochures within [ten] days from the date of my\n                decision. 250    Damages to be awarded to the Defendants for\n                    copyright infringement are to be assessed. 251    I will hear parties on costs at a later\n                    date.
