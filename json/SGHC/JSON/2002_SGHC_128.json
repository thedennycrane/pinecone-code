The defence\n\nfiled referred to various facts and issues which could have been pleaded more concisely\n\nand clearly than they were, but in effect there were three lines of defence. The first is\n\nthat no agreement was concluded and the fax of 19 October was a draft agreement for sale\n\nand purchase which was subject to conditions, and those conditions were not met. The\n\nconditions were:(i) Shweta and Lanyard must agree to the\n\n  sale;(ii) a written sale agreement was to be\n\n  executed by the plaintiff, defendant, Shweta and Lanyard;(iii) the plaintiff was to pay the import\n\n  duty on the oil; and(iv) Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd\n\n  (\"WTPL\"), a shareholder of the plaintiff company, was to take an interest-free\n\n  loan of $1.4m from the bank and advance it to the plaintiff to pay the import duty1.7.\n\n        The second line of defence is that if there was\n\na contract it was not enforceable when it became impossible of performance and was\n\nfrustrated because(i) Lanyard did not agree to transfer the\n\n  bill of entry to the plaintiff, and(ii) on or about 1 November 2000 there was\n\n  an order restraining the sale of the oil2.8.\n\n        The last line of defence is that if a contract\n\nwas concluded it was vitiated because both parties had acted in the mistaken belief that\n\nthe bill of entry can be transferred to the plaintiff3.9.\n\n        The bank also made a counterclaim against the\n\nplaintiff. It was a curious claim for the loss it suffered loss when the contract was not\n\ncarried out. Nothing in the pleadings or evidence explained the basis of the claim for\n\nloss on a contract which existence it denied, and which it had refused to perform. The\n\ncounterclaim was withdrawn in the course of the trial subject to the bank paying costs in\n\nthe counterclaim up to the time of withdrawal.10.\n\n        Four persons were involved in the negotiations\n\nfor the sale of the oil. They are Rajesh S. Adani (\"Rajesh Adani\") the Managing\n\nDirector of the plaintiff, Chetan Parikh, Sunil Kumar and Mahesh Mehta.11.\n\n        The first three persons gave evidence in these\n\nproceedings. The plaintiff had summoned Mahesh Mehta as a witness but did not call him,\n\nand offered him to the bank, but the bank did not take up the offer.12.\n\n        Chetan Parikh’s evidence is that he came\n\nto know of the oil from Mahesh Mehta when they met on 13 October 2000. This was followed\n\nup by negotiations over the telephone between himself, Rajesh Adani and Mahesh Mehta.\n\nEventually they agreed on the price at 170 Rps/10 kgs on the basis that the bank will pay\n\nthe import duty.13.\n\n        He went to the bank and met with Mahesh Mehta\n\nand Sunil Kumar to tie down details on the delivery of the oil to the plaintiff and the\n\nbank’s payment of the import duty. Sunil Kumar told him that the bank could not pay\n\nthe import duty itself because it was not the importer of the oil in India and that it\n\nneeded the plaintiff’s assistance as an importer to pay the duty on its behalf.\n\nChetan Parikh suggested that he should speak to Rajesh Adani who was familiar with customs\n\nprocedures. He also made it clear that the plaintiff did not want to be involved with\n\nShweta and Lanyard in the purchase.14.\n\n        On 19 October, he received the fax from Sunil\n\nKumar. He was surprised that Shweta and Lanyard were included as parties in the contract.\n\nHe went to seek clarification from Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar on that. Sunil Kumar\n\nassured him that the plaintiff did not have to worry over that because Shweta and Lanyard\n\nwere included as an internal matter between the bank and Shweta.15.\n\n        After 19 October he followed up with the bank\n\non the payment of the import duty, but little progress was being made. He sent faxes and\n\nspoke with Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar, but with no result until matters came to a head\n\non 13 November, when the bank took the position that there was no contract between them.\n\nFurther efforts made to proceed with the purchase also failed.16.\n\n        Rajesh Adani’s evidence was consistent\n\nwith Chetan Parikh’s. He spoke with Mahesh Mehta over the telephone and informed him\n\nthat the plaintiff would only buy the oil if the bank paid the duty. When the transaction\n\nstalled, he wrote to the bank on 30 October, 8 November and 10 November to press it to\n\nperform the contract but the bank did not respond till 13 November when it denied that\n\nthere was a contract to perform.17.\n\n        Sunil Kumar gave the bank’s account of the\n\nevents. He and Mahesh Mehta met with Chetan Parikh on 18 October. In the ensuing\n\ndiscussion they told Chetan Parikh that the original seller of the oil was Shweta, and the\n\noriginal buyer was Lanyard, and that the bank was selling the oil as pledgee. They also\n\ntold him that the oil was in bonded storage tanks and the bill of entry was issued in the\n\nname of Lanyard, but Lanyard had not paid the customs duty, and had agreed to transfer the\n\nbill of entry to the plaintiff for it to take delivery of the oil.18.\n\n        Sunil Kumar went on to say that it was clear to\n\nall the parties that Lanyard was to be a crucial party to the sale4and that\n\nthe plaintiff was to be responsible for the payment of the duty5. However the\n\nplaintiff did not have the resources to pay and it was agreed that the bank would consider\n\nmaking a loan to WTPL which was a customer of the bank, to be used for that purpose6.19.\n\n        After that meeting, he prepared a draft\n\ncontract and faxed it to Chetan Parikh on 19 October. Chetan Parikh’s response after\n\nreceiving the fax was that it was broadly acceptable save for two items – first that\n\nthe 60 day delivery period was to run from the date of the transfer of the bill of entry,\n\nand second that the sale was not a direct sale, and that a broker was to be involved.20.\n\n        He then turned his attention to the loan to\n\nWTPL, the transfer of the bill of entry from Lanyard’s name to the plaintiff’s\n\nand the delivery orders to be issued to enable the plaintiff to take delivery.21.\n\n        The loan to WTPL was put in the charge of his\n\ncolleague Lynn Ng. She submitted a credit memorandum with another officer, Angeline Tang\n\non 20 October to the bank’s credit committee. Although the credit committed approved\n\nthe proposed facility the offer of the facility was not carried through.22.\n\n        On 27 October, he received telephone calls from\n\nShweta and Lanyard that there were rumours of a customs duty increase, and that they did\n\nnot wish to proceed with the transaction with the plaintiff. He informed Mahesh Mehta,\n\nJacqueline Chang and Lynn Ng of this7. (In this regard what he did not do is\n\nmore significant than what he did. The plaintiff was not informed of Shweta and\n\nLanyard’s decision. It would be expected that if the plaintiff and the bank had\n\nagreed that the sale was subject to Shweta and Lanyard’s agreement, that Sunil Kumar\n\nor the bank would notify the plaintiff of Shweta and Lanyard’s decisions.)23.\n\n        Legal proceedings were taken out in respect of\n\nthe oil in India. Punjab National Bank (\"PNB\") sued for monies owing to it by\n\nLanyard. On 1 November PNB obtained an interim injunction restraining the bank from\n\nparting with any property of Lanyard that it held. The bank succeeded in having the order\n\nset aside on 5 July 2001, but it was reinstated on appeal on 25 July.24.\n\n        The plaintiff was not a party to the legal\n\nproceedings in India. The bank did not invite their participation as it had already taken\n\nthe position on 13 November 2000 that there was no contract of sale between them.\n\nNevertheless two matters in the Indian proceedings are of relevance. First, there was a\n\nconsent order which released part of the oil to ten parties upon payment8.\n\nSecond, the bank by its representative, Mufazal Kantawala, deposed in an affidavit filed\n\nin those proceedings that the bank had sold a substantial portion of the oil before the\n\ninjunction was issued.25.\n\n        There was a body of contemporaneous documents\n\nwhich shed light on the disputed matters.26.\n\n        The first is an email dated 18 October from\n\nChetan Parikh to Rajesh Adani, Sunil Kumar and Mahesh Mehta. This email, which preceded\n\nSunil Kumar’s fax of 19 October reads in partThe deal has been finalised between\n\n  AWL, India and RaboBank Sporeon flwg terms:-Cargo: Degummed Rape Seed OilQuantity: Approx. 9,700 mtonsPrice: Rs. 17,000/- per mtonWeights: ex-tank Kandla final. Material is in six (6) stowage tanks lying at Friends and\n\n  Friends, Kandla.…Duty: Past, Present and Future for account\n\n  of sellers RaboBank. AWL is not accountable for duty increase/decrease.…AWL has to give the schedule for taking\n\n  delivery.Rabobank has to inform buyers where to\n\n  effect payment at the rate of Rs. 17,000/- pmt in order to take daily/periodic delivery.(Emphasis added)27.\n\n        The first sentence which referred affirmatively\n\nto a concluded contract was not contradicted by Mahesh Mehta or Sunil Kumar. The latter\n\nsaid that he did not read the email when it was received, printed out and filed9.\n\nThis email showed that Chetan Parikh regarded there to be a concluded contract, and\n\nexpected Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar to be of like mind. He is unlikely to send this\n\nmessage if he knew that there was no contract, because Mahesh Mehta and Sunil Kumar would\n\ncontradict and correct him when they read the message. He would not know that Sunil Kumar\n\nwould not read messages that were received and filed.28.\n\n        Sunil Kumar’s fax of 19 October set out in\n\npara 6 also referred to the oil being sold to the plaintiff. Nothing in the fax indicated\n\nthat the sale was subject to any other conditions than those mentioned.29.\n\n        The next document of relevance is the credit\n\nmemorandum of 20 October. The salient parts of this memorandum read –Credit memorandum dated 20 October 2000,\n\n  by Lynn Ng/AngelineTang of Rabobank, Singapore BranchClient: Wilmar Trading Pte LtdRequest:1. To grant Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd\n\n  USD1,400,000a 2 month Short Term Advance of upto USD1.4 min on an interest-free basis, to pay for the\n\n  import duty in relation to Adani Wilmar’s purchase of 9,000 mt of Degummed Rapeseed\n\n  Oil (part of the cargo held by the Bank for account of Shweta).2. Next internal review date: May 2001Purpose/Rationale:To expedite the sale of the rapeseed\n\n    oilheld by the Bank as security under Shweta International Pte Ltd.Executive Summary: Background to the\n\n  requestShweta International Pte Ltd had defaulted\n\n    on their payments to the Bank, and we had subsequently enforced our security rights over\n\n    the edible oils stored in India, under the Collateral Management Agreement.9,000 mt of rapeseed oil sold to Adani\n\n    Wilmar Limited1) Rabobank had arranged to sell 9,000 mt\n\n    of rapeseed oil to Adani Wilmar Limited at theprice of Rp170/10 kg(inclusive\n\n    of the custom duty payable). As it is likely that there would be an increase in the\n\n    import duty in November,it is in the interest of the Bank to make an immediate upfront\n\n    payment of the import dutyprior to the announcement.2) However,as the Bank is not in the\n\n    position to pay the customs duty directly in India, we have to pay the customs duty via\n\n    Adani-Wilmar. Adani-Wilmar had in turn, requested Wilmar Trading to fund the customs\n\n    payment. Wilmar Trading was only agreeable to this provided that the loan is extended on\n\n    an interest-free basis, since it is the Bank that will benefit from the lower duty paid.3) The delivery of the oil would take over\n\n    a period of 2 months, andunder the terms of our sales agreement, the storage\n\n    charges would be borne by Rabobank. As such, we are requesting that the tenor of this\n\n    exceptional interest free Short Term Advance be set at 60 days.… …3) Modus operandia) The oil will be delivered against cash\n\n      (Rp) payment from Adani Wilmar, with payment collected through our nominated bank, DBS\n\n      Mumbai, and converted into USD for remittance to us.b)The USD1.4 mln loan will be retired\n\n      upon receipt of the sales proceeds.Recommendation1. We recommend that the interest free\n\n    loan of upto USD1.4 mln, be extended to Wilmar Trading Pte Ltd. This exposure is necessaryto enable the Bank to make an immediate upfront payment on the customs duty, to\n\n    avoid the import duty hike anticipated in November 2000.(Emphasis added)30.\n\n        This credit memorandum was submitted to the\n\nbank’s Credit Committee of Singapore (\"CCS\") which noted in its acceptance\n\nof the recommendation thatConcurredCCS understands thatWilmar\n\n  Trading is doing this as a favour for Rabobankand has requested for an interest free\n\n  financing for 60 days. Given the expect increased in custom duty, fear of price falling\n\n  further and the further deterioration in cargo quality, CCS is prepared to concur with\n\n  this request despite the fact that there will be no personal guarantee.(Emphasis added)31.\n\n        When the bank failed to offer the loan to WTPL\n\nLynn Ng sent an email to it on 31 October to explain thatI had obtained approval for the above\n\n  facility and had prepared a letter of offer …However, I was informed by my colleague,\n\n  Sunil, who had negotiated the sale of the oil with Kamlesh, thatthere were some issues\n\n  pending at our end, which will materially impact the transaction being contemplated.\n\n  As such, I was instructed to hold back the issuance of the letter.(Emphasis added)32.\n\n        Apparently Sunil Kumar had informed her that\n\nthere were issues pendingat the bank’s end. It is also apparent that he did\n\nnot inform her that the sale had fallen through because Shweta and Lanyard did not agree\n\nto it.33.\n\n        The next set of relevant documents is an\n\nexchange of email messages between Sunil Kumar and Jacqueline Chang (Assistant General\n\nManager and head of the Trade and Commodity Finance department) on 6 November. In the\n\nfirst message, Sunil Kumar reported to her on the problems that had arisenMr Chetan Parikh, broker for the above\n\n  transaction, came to see me today after leaving a couple of messages for me.He indicates that Rabo had a verbal\n\n  commitment to deliver the oil to Adani Wilmar and would expect us to perform on the\n\n  contract although our understanding was that all 4 parties (Rabo, Lanyard, Shweta and\n\n  Adani) should sign on the contract. He mentioned that Adani Wilmar had to deliver the\n\n  refined reapeseed to its own buyers and would be in default if the oil was not delivered.\n\n  Hence, any loss incurred could be claimed from Rabo.I subsequently spoke to Rajesh Adani, the\n\n  promoter of Adani Group. He indicated that despite the injunction (which is known to\n\n  them), we should consign the BLs to them and they would get the injunction lifted\n\n  themselves, being the consignee under the BLs. However, when I inquired whether\n\n  Rabo’s obligations would end if the injunction was not lifted, he was non-committed\n\n  on this issue.34.\n\n        Jacqueline Chang’s response wasThis is a tricky situation. In a sense,\n\n  it’s not a bad thing that we did not succeed with pulling the deal through with\n\n  Wilmar as we would not have been able to allow delivery of oil (and risk getting ourselves\n\n  sued!).As discussed, Adani’s proposal that\n\n  they could work around the order or better still to lift the order would mean going\n\n  directly against Lanyard, which is a risk that I am not prepared to take. Lanyard could\n\n  very well frustrate our sale efforts and the complications could be exponential. In any\n\n  case, it is not possible (?) to consign B/Ls to Adani when it had already been used, and\n\n  1/3 released to ITS and shipowner during discharge. Furthermore, some of the cargo may\n\n  have import duty paid by Lanyard or its buyers further complicating the matter …Unless Adani is willing to pay us against\n\n  release of oil – thereafter all risks assumed by them, I will not support\n\n  Adani’s proposal.35.\n\n        What did she mean when she wrote that the bank\n\n\"did not succeed with pulling the deal through with Wilmar\"? On the face of it,\n\nshe appeared to accept that there was a deal which the bank could not perform, not that\n\nthere was no agreement at all.36.\n\n        Even when matters went up to the head of the\n\ndepartment, the bank did not inform the plaintiff that there was really no contract to\n\nperform. It only did that after receiving several series of letters from the plaintiff\n\ndemanding that it performed the contract. In its letter of 8 November signed by Rajesh\n\nAdani, the plaintiff statedinter aliaWe understand that you are having\n\n  difficulty amounting to delay at your end for timely delivery of the cargo. Neither you\n\n  (Rabobank) nor us (AWL) can deny the fact that we have concluded the deal between us on a\n\n  willing buyer/seller basis. It was your expressed desire that we take the delivery of oil\n\n  urgently so that Rabobank receives the payment quickly. We agreed only with an intention\n\n  to help Rabobank in the matter.We negotiated with you for the entire\n\n  quantity of 9000 MT (+/- 5%) at an agreed and established price of Rs 17,000 PMT. Both the\n\n  parties were satisfied with the deal including the agreed price.In my discussion with Mr. Sunil Kumar\n\n  & Mr Mahesh Mehta, I had categorically stated that the deal is exclusively between\n\n  Rabobank & Adani Wilmar Ltd, India and we have nothing to do with either Lanyard or\n\n  Shweta. I was given assurance that the matter with Lanyard & Shweta and will be sorted\n\n  out by Rabobank and I \"need not worry about it\". However, having concluded the\n\n  deal we have been send a draft contract, whereby Shweta & Lanyard had been brought\n\n  into the picture.We would like to make it clear that our\n\n  (AWL) dealing was with Rabobank only and at no time we had discussion or an interest to\n\n  have an understanding or dialogue with either Shweta or Lanyard.We hope that Rabobank will not thrust onto\n\n  us to resort to any unpleasant means to rightfully take delivery of the oil sold by you to\n\n  us. Having concluded the deal over long discussions, we now cannot accept any turnaround\n\n  on the deal, which has been concluded honorably. We stand to lose a huge sum of monies if\n\n  we do not receive the oil, Rabobank and AWL are answerable to each other for timely\n\n  performance.37.\n\n        Faced with notice of \"unpleasant\n\nmeans\", the bank finally took a stand on the matter when it replied on 13 November\n\nthatWe do not agree to your allegation that\n\n  there is a concluded agreement between us for the sale of 9000 Mt Degummed Rapeseed Oil as\n\n  all negotiations are subject to contract. Furthermore, the Bill of Entry relating to the\n\n  goods is in the name of Lanyard Foods Ltd. Without Lanyard Foods Ltd’s co-operation\n\n  to transfer the Bill of Entry into buyers’ name, the sale cannot be proceeded. You\n\n  are full aware of this fact. The draft contract faxed to you was sent on the premise that\n\n  all four parties will agree to the terms therein.You have no doubt that there is an\n\n  injunction preventing the sale or disposal of the goods by Lanyard Foods Ltd. Of course,\n\n  any sale which we or anyone can enter into must be subject to the ability of the parties\n\n  to perform. Until the injunction is vacated, we cannot continue to discuss the sale of the\n\n  goods.On Friday 10 November 2000, there was a\n\n  discussion between our Mr Mehta and your Mr Rajesh Adani when we told you that there is a\n\n  possibility for Lanyard to agree to sell through us a quantity of about 6000 Mts. This\n\n  however is subject to the injunction against the sale of the cargo being lifted.As you are aware there is an application\n\n  by us to lift the injunction fixed for hearing tomorrow. If we succeed with this, then the\n\n  possibility of a sale of about 6000 Mt on the cargo can be discussed further and subject\n\n  to contract we will work towards this.38.\n\n        However, this position taken by the bank was\n\ncontradicted by an affidavit filed by Mufazal Kantawala on behalf of the bank on 5\n\nDecember in the Indian proceedings where he deposedI say that the Applicants [the bank] are\n\n  ready and will to sell and dispose off the said goods under the orders of this\n\n  Hon’ble Tribunal and account for the sale proceeds to this Hon’ble tribunal\n\n  pending determination of their Application to set aside/vacate the order dated 1/11/2000.\n\n  I say that the Applicants are entitled to right of sale of the said cargo. In facta\n\n  substantial portion of cargo was sold by the Applicants even before any orders were passedby the Hon’ble DRAT. The Appellants [Punjab National Bank] were well aware of the\n\n  sale/s but are deliberately feigning ignorance.(Emphasis added)39.\n\n        When Sunil Kumar was referred to the affidavit,\n\nhe was unable to explain that statement and he maintained that there was no sale of the\n\noil by the bank to the plaintiff or any other party10. If the bank had not sold\n\nthe oil to other parties the deponent was most probably referring to the transaction with\n\nthe plaintiff, and was calling it a concluded sale.40.\n\n        Jacqueline Chang, Lynn Ng and Angeline Tang and\n\nMufazal Kantawala did not give any explanation to their statements which stated or implied\n\nthat there was a concluded agreement. The three bank officers had left the bank by the\n\ntime of the action, but there was no suggestion that they or Mufazal Kantawala were unable\n\nor unwilling to give evidence. The reasonable inference to be drawn is that the bank did\n\nnot want to explain or qualify what was written.41.\n\n        Looking at the evidence in its totality, the\n\nplaintiff had been consistent throughout that there was a contract, the bank’s\n\nposition to the contrary was contradicted by its own documents. I find that the plaintiff\n\nhad proved on a balance of probabilities that there was a concluded agreement on the sale\n\nof the oil. That disposed of the questions whether Shweta and Lanyard had to agree to the\n\nsale and whether there was to be a written agreement.42.\n\n        The next issue is whether the plaintiff or the\n\nbank was to pay the custom or import duty. The fax of 19 October made it clear that the\n\nplaintiff was to pay for the oil byademand draft, without any obligation on it to\n\npay the import duty separately. If there was any doubt, that it is surely settled by the\n\nstatements in the credit memorandum of 20 October that \"it is in the interest of the\n\nBank to make immediate upfront payment of the import duty\", and as \"the Bank is\n\nnot in the position to pay the customs duty directly in India, we have to pay the customs\n\nduty via Adani-Wilmar.\"43.\n\n        On the related issue of the loan to WTPL to pay\n\nthe duty, that was not referred to as a condition to the sale in the faxes of 18 October\n\nwhen the terms were set out by Chetan Parikh and of 19 October when the terms were set out\n\nby Sunil Kumar, and not even in the bank’s letter of 13 November when it set out its\n\nreasons for stating that there was no agreement. If it was such a condition all that time,\n\nit should have been mentioned. But even if there was this condition, it was the bank which\n\nheld back the loan because of issues pending at the bank’s end, as stated in Lynn\n\nNg’s email of 31 October. The bank cannot rely on its own default as a defence.44.\n\n        I will now examine the defence that the\n\nagreement was discharged on the ground of frustration. A contract is said to be frustrated\n\nwhen something renders it physically or commercially impossible to be fulfilled, or\n\ntransforms the obligation to perform into a radically different obligation. The bank\n\npleaded that if there was a contract, it was frustrated on two grounds.45.\n\n        The first ground was that Lanyard did not agree\n\nto transfer the bill of entry to the plaintiff. This alone does not discharge the contract\n\nunless Lanyard’s refusal rendered the performance of the contract impossible. Sunil\n\nKumar’s evidence is that he had been informed by the customs authorities that a new\n\nbill of entry could be obtained without the co-operation of Lanyard. He deposed in his\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chiefI was told by the customs authorities that\n\n  … notwithstanding that the bill of entry is in the name of the Defendants’ [the\n\n  bank’s] defaulting client is to obtain a court order from the Indian court. Since the\n\n  Defendants are the pledgees to the goods, they can make an application to the Indian Court\n\n  stating that their client has defaulted in the facility and the goods have not been paid\n\n  by the importer, the Defendants are seeking to enforce the security against their client\n\n  by obtaining possession over the goods for the purpose of selling the said goods to\n\n  satisfy the outstanding amount11.The advice had come from the deputy\n\ncommissioner in charge of Kandla port12.46.\n\n        However he did not act on the advice and\n\nregarded it was incorrect. His decision was not influenced by any contradicting\n\ninformation from the customs authorities, but because the opinion of the bank’s\n\nexpert witness, Mathew D’Silva, a retired assistant commissioner of customs and\n\ncustoms consultant. It was curious that neither Sunil Kumar nor D’Silva went back to\n\nthe customs authorities to check if the original advice stood and reflected the prevailing\n\ncustoms practice. This was a serious omission because if the advice was correct,\n\npossession of and title in the oil can pass without Lanyard’s co-operation.47.\n\n        It transpired that the expert D’Silva had\n\ngiven his opinion in the mistaken belief that the customs duty on the oil was paid and\n\nthat the goods had been cleared from customs13. He relied on s 149 of the\n\nCustoms Act 1962 and came to his conclusion that \"no Bill of Entry shall be\n\nauthorised to be amended after the goods have been cleared for Home Consumption or\n\ndeposited in a bonded warehouse (under section 149 of Customs Act 1962).\"14Section 149 readsAmendment of documents – Save as\n\n  otherwise provided in sections 30 and 41, the proper officer may, in his discretion,\n\n  authorise any document, after it has been presented in the custom house to be amended:Provided that no amendment of a bill of entry or a shipping bill or bill of export shall\n\n  be so authorised to be amended after the imported goods have been cleared for home\n\n  consumption or deposited in a warehouse, or the export goods have been exported, except on\n\n  the basis of documentary evidence which was in existence at the time the goods were\n\n  cleared, deposited or exported, as the case may be.48.\n\n        The plaintiff’s expert witness Vikram S\n\nNankani, an advocate practising in custom laws disagreed with that opinion. He said that\n\nD’Silva’s reliance on the proviso in s 149 was misplaced because s 149 did not\n\naffect ss 30 and41, and s 30(3) empowers the customs authority to permit an import\n\nmanifest or import report which is incorrect or incomplete to be amended or supplemented\n\nin the absence of any fraudulent intention. The provision reads30(3) If the proper officer is satisfied\n\n  that the import manifest or import report is in any way incorrect or incomplete, and that\n\n  there was no fraudulent intention, he may permit it to be amended or supplemented.49.\n\n        He went on to state that2.5 There is, however, no provision under\n\n  the said Act, which either prohibits or permits the cancellation of Bills of Entry\n\n  (whether for home consumption or for warehousing) filed by any person claiming to be the\n\n  importer and substitution thereof by a fresh Bill of Entry by another person also claiming\n\n  to be the importer. The Courts in India have, however, accepted the right of foreign\n\n  seller or the owner of the goods to sell the goods to a new buyer after import of goods\n\n  into India. This view has been taken by the Calcutta High Court in Taiping International\n\n  [1997 (89) ELT 457]. The Courts in India have also recognised the right of the foreign\n\n  seller or owner to recall/re-ship the goods after the same have been imported into India.\n\n  This view has been taken by the Supreme Court of India in Union of India – Vs –\n\n  Sampatraj Dugar [1992 (58) ELT 163]. Although there is no provision in the said Act for\n\n  acceptance or recognition of such rights, the Courts have followed the common law\n\n  principles like the rights of an unpaid seller, in laying down this law. Similarly, in the\n\n  absence of any provision either prohibiting or permitting substitution, of the bill of\n\n  entry by the new buyer in lieu of the one already filed by an importer, such substitution\n\n  would be governed by the general law of contract and sale of goods, subject to the\n\n  conditions prescribed by sub-section (3) of Section 30 of the said Act, as set out above.\n\n  Resort to the general law is necessary in respect of areas not covered by the said Act.2.6 Under the General Law of Contract and\n\n  Sale of Goods, the bill of lading is a document of title. The holder or endorsee of the\n\n  bill of lading has the custody of (constructive) and control over the goods. Upon\n\n  surrender of the original and negotiable copies of the bills of lading, the holder thereof\n\n  can obtain fresh bill of lading in the name of any other person. Upon receipt of fresh\n\n  bills of lading drawn in the name of a new person (read as buyer also) the holder of the\n\n  fresh set of bills of lading as owner of the goods, can endorse the bills of lading in\n\n  favour of the new person (buyer) and instruct the carrier through its agents to give\n\n  effect to the fresh bills of lading and carry out consequential amendment in the manifest.\n\n  This means that the steamer agent in India shall make an application for amendment of the\n\n  manifest, which subject to the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 30, the proper\n\n  officer may allow. In the event such an application is allowed, the basis of the bill of\n\n  entry filed by the first person disappears and consequently, the new importer whose name\n\n  is now substituted in the manifest, can file the Bill of Entry15.The bank’s expert did not offer any\n\ncomments on these statements.50.\n\n        There was no authoritative evidence that a bill\n\nof entry cannot be issued in the plaintiff’s name without Lanyard’s assistance.\n\nUpon reviewing the two experts’ opinions and Sunil Kumar’s evidence, I find that\n\nthe bank had not proved that the bill of entry could not be changed without Lanyard’s\n\nagreement, or that the contract was frustrated by Lanyard’s refusal to co-operate.51.\n\n        The second ground of frustration the bank\n\nrelied on was the injunction issued in India against the sale of the oil. The existence\n\nand terms of the injunction were established, but its effect on the transaction was not.\n\nSuch an injunction may be discharged, and in fact, this was done in respect of the sale of\n\nsome of the oil to ten other parties. The prospect of obtaining a discharge is enhanced if\n\nsecurity is offered, but the bank did not offer security when it applied to discharge the\n\ninjunction16and it did not enquire with the plaintiff if it was prepared to\n\nassist in the application. The truth of the situation was that it had repudiated the\n\nagreement with the plaintiff, and did not take any action to discharge the injunction for\n\nthe purpose of proceeding with the sale to it. The bank cannot say that it was prevented\n\nby the injunction from performing the contract.52.\n\n        The bank’s final defence is mistake –\n\nthat it and the plaintiff had entered into the contract under the mistaken belief that the\n\nbill of entry could be transferred. The fax of 19 October stated that Lanyard was to\n\nassist in the transfer of the bill of entry. Insofar as Lanyard would not offer its\n\nassistance, it can be said that both parties were mistaken in the belief or expectation\n\nthat it would. But that is not the end of the matter. Contracts are robust creatures, they\n\ndo not fall to just any mistake. Only mistakes which lie at the root of the contract would\n\nhave that effect.53.\n\n        Lanyard’s assistance to transfer the bill\n\nof entry was not a critical part of the contract. The contract was for the bank to sell\n\nthe oil to the plaintiff. The transfer of possession of the oil to the plaintiff was an\n\nessential part of the transaction, but the manner of the transfer was not. If Lanyard\n\nwould not co-operate and the contract remains in force, other ways would have to be found\n\nto deliver possession of the oil to the plaintiff. The mistake here did not release the\n\nbank from its obligations.54.\n\n        In the course of the trial, Sunil Kumar\n\nrevealed that the bills of lading to the oil had been endorsed and handed over to Lanyard\n\nsometime between September 1999 and April 2000. This was not disclosed to counsel for\n\neither party earlier. Consequently the plaintiff applied for and was granted leave to\n\namend its statement of claim to add a further claim that the bank had breached the term\n\nimplied by s 12 of the Sales of Goods Act (Cap 393) that the bank had the right to sell\n\nthe oil17.55.\n\n        The bank admitted that the bills of lading were\n\nendorsed and handed over to Lanyard by its agent in India, Caleb Brett (Canada) Ltd. It\n\npleaded that this was done without its knowledge or authorisation, and that there was no\n\nintention to pass any property to Lanyard, but only to enable it to take the oil from the\n\nvessel to store it in bonded storage tanks. The bank also claimed that there was no\n\nconsideration for the endorsement and that Lanyard admitted in a letter of 16 August 2000\n\nthat it had not paid for the oil, and the title lies with Shweta18.56.\n\n        Sunil Kumar’s evidence was that he and\n\nMahesh Mehta found out in April-June 200019about the endorsement and delivery\n\nto the bills of lading to Lanyard. The bank did not explain why it took no action to have\n\nthe bills of lading endorsed and delivered back to it, or any other action to rectify the\n\nsituation.57.\n\n        The bank sought to tender in evidence the\n\nletter from Lanyard dated 16 August. Counsel for the plaintiff objected on the ground that\n\nthe letter was not disclosed during discovery, and that it should be formally proved by\n\nthe writer. I accepted the force of the objections and ruled that the letter was not\n\nadmissible in evidence.58.\n\n        Even if the bank was not aware of and had not\n\nauthorised the endorsement and delivery of the bills of lading, title to the oil had\n\npassed to Lanyard by the endorsement and delivery of the bills of lading in the absence of\n\nany clear and admissible evidence to the contrary. The bank would have no right to sell\n\nthe oil as pledgee. Consequently, the plaintiff have also established its case under s 12.59.\n\n        I give judgment to the plaintiff with costs and\n\norder that the damages payable to it be assessed by the Registrar.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudge-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------1Re-amended Defence para 62Re-amended Defence para 83Re-amended Defence para 8A4Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar para 295Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar para 316Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar paras 32 and 347Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar para 638Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar para 70 and pages 162-1719Notes of Evidence page 56710Notes of Evidence page 70611Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nof Sunil Kumar para 1812Notes of Evidence page 49813Notes of Evidence page 36914Expert Witness Report of Mathew\n\nD’Silva para 1015Expert Witness Report of Vikram\n\nS.
