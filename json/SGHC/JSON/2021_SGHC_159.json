        "Facts": "2 The plaintiff is a publicly listed company incorporated in Singapore.1Foot Note 1×Bundle of Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief (“BAEIC”) at Tab 1, p 294.The plaintiff has a wholly owned subsidiary, Atlantic Navigations Holdings Inc (“ANHINC”), which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands.2Foot Note 2×Statement of Claim dated 28 January 2020 (“SOC”) at para 1; Defence dated 19 February 2020 (“Defence”) at para 2. 3 The second defendant is a company incorporated in the Marshall Islands.3Foot Note 3×SOC at para 3; Defence at para 4.The first defendant is the director of the second defendant.4Foot Note 4×Malcolm Chang’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief (“2nd Df’s AEIC’) at para 1. 4 Pursuant to a shareholders’ agreement dated 14 November 2014 (the “Shareholders’ Agreement”), ANHINC and the second defendant entered into a joint venture to form AVI, a company incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, for the purpose of buying, owning, chartering and selling vessels.5Foot Note 5×Wong Siew Cheong’s Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief dated 5 January 2021 (“Wong’s AEIC”) at para 4.The parties of the joint venture agreed that ANHINC would hold 51% of the shareholding of AVI, while the second defendant would hold 49% of the shareholding of AVI.6Foot Note 6×Wong’s AEIC at para 4 and p 10.ANHINC and the second defendant also agreed to secure a term loan of up to US$8.4m from the Bank to partly finance AVI’s acquisition of a vessel named “AOS Triumph” (the “Vessel”).7Foot Note 7×Wong’s AEIC at para 5.They also agreed for AVI to enter into a ship management agreement (the “SMA”) with Atlantic Maritime Group (FZE) (“AMG”),8Foot Note 8×Core Bundle (“CB”) at p 1831.a wholly owned subsidiary of ANHINC.9Foot Note 9×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 4. 5 AVI subsequently entered into a US$8.4m Commodity Murabahah Financing Facility Agreement dated 22 May 2015 (the “Facility Agreement”),10Foot Note 10×CB at pp 1859–1919.with the Bank. The terms of the Facility Agreement provided,inter alia, for AVI as “Customer” to enter into a sale contract where the Bank purchased the Vessel for US$8.4m and resold the Vessel to AVI for US$10.815m (the “Sales Price”).  It was agreed that the Sales Price be paid in the following manner:11Foot Note 11×CB at p 1878. SECTION 5.08  DEFERRED PAYMENT OF BANK’S SALES PRICE The Customer shall pay the Bank’s Sales Price by twenty (20) quarterly payments consisting of nineteen (19) equal quarterly principal payments of US$420,000.00 each and a final twentieth (20th) quarterly principal payment consisting of the balance principal amount of the Facility, together with the Periodic Profit Amount due for the final Profit Period, less the aggregate of all amounts to which the Bank has granted a Rebate. The first of such instalments shall be due and payable on the date falling six (6) months from the Disbursement Date and the subsequent instalments shall be due and payable on the corresponding date of each succeeding quarter thereafter or such other dates as the Bank may specify . If any payment due date under this Agreement would otherwise be due on a day which is not a Business Day, it shall instead fall on the immediately preceding Business Day. 6 The plaintiff, the first defendant, and the second defendant each executed guarantees dated 22 May 2015 (collectively the “Guarantees”) in favour of the Bank, in consideration of the Bank making or continuing to make available to AVI banking facilities.12Foot Note 12×CB at pp 1920–1958.The amounts recoverable by the Bank from the guarantors under the Guarantees are subject to the following limits: (a) Against the plaintiff: US$10,080,000.00;13Foot Note 13×CB at p 1920. (b) Against the first defendant: US$4,939,200.00;14Foot Note 14×CB at p 1934.and (c) Against the second defendant: US$4,939,200.00.15Foot Note 15×CB at p 1946. 7 Clause 4 is the same across each of the Guarantees. It states that:16Foot Note 16×CB at pp 1921 4.1 The Guarantor undertakes to the Bank that so long as the Customer has any actual or contingent liability to the Bank,the Guarantor shall not exercise any rightswhich the Guarantor may at any time have whether by reason of performance by it of its obligations under this Guarantee or otherwise: …. (d)to claim any contribution from any other guarantor of the Customer’s obligations; … [emphasis added] 8 On or about May, August and November 2019, the quarterly instalments due from AVI to the Bank under the Facility Agreement became payable.17Foot Note 17×Wong’s AEIC at pp 121, 125 and 126.AVI was unable to make payment on these instalments.18Foot Note 18×Wong’s AEIC at paras 11–12. 9 The Plaintiff made payment of the three (3) quarterly instalments as one of the guarantors, for the months of May, August and November 2019, for a total of US$1,042,748.07.19Foot Note 19×SOC at para 12; Wong’s AEIC at para 12.

(a) a declaration that the defendants and each of them are jointly and severally liable to contribute to the amounts paid or to be paid by the plaintiff under the Guarantees; (b) the sum of US$510,946.55 or severally the sum of US$255,473.28 being rateably the defendants’ proportion of the sums due under their respective Guarantees; and (c) interest at 5.33% per annum in respect of each of the three payments from the due dates set out in [12] of the Statement of Claim (ie,31 May 2019, 30 August 2019 and 29 November 2019) until the date of judgment pursuant to s 12(1) Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed). 12 The defendants’ main defences are: (a) First, that there was oppression of the second defendant due to repeated breaches of the SMA between AVI and AMG by the plaintiff, ANHINC and/or AMG. In particular, the plaintiff, through AMG and ANHINC, procured AMG’s breach of the SMA. This has resulted in AVI incurring losses on a yearly basis.27Foot Note 27×Defendants’ Written Submissions dated 20 May 2021 (“DWS”) at paras 118–152. (b) Second, the current action is unjust towards them, as the most appropriate action at this juncture would be to sell the Vessel and settle the loan with the Bank, due to the Vessel’s operation expenses exceeding the income from the Vessel.28Foot Note 28×DWS at paras 153–160.",
        "Main issues": "13 The overarching question is whether the plaintiff is entitled to call on the defendants as co-guarantors to seek contribution for the payments made by the plaintiff to the Bank set out at [9] above. There are three main issues: (a) Whether a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and defendants is required before the plaintiff can seek contribution under the Guarantees (“Issue 1”); (b) Whether there is a need for the Bank to call on the guarantors to make payment first before a guarantor’s entitlement for contribution arises (“Issue 2”); and (c) Whether the alleged oppression of ANHINC and the contractual breaches by AMG are relevant to the defendants resisting the claim for contribution (“Issue 3”). This involves the following two sub-issues: (i) whether the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are one and the same; and (ii) whether there were oppressive acts by AMG and ANHINC on the defendants such that it was inequitable for the plaintiff to claim contribution.",
        "Issue 1: Whether a contractual relationship between the plaintiff and the defendants is needed before the plaintiff seeks contribution under the Guarantees": "",
        "Parties’ cases": "30 The defendants sought to rely on the alleged oppressive acts by ANHINC or the alleged breaches of the SMA by AMG to argue that it is inequitable for the plaintiff to seek contribution. Whether the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are one and the same 31 The defendants submitted that the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are in fact the same entity. The court should lift the corporate veil such that the oppressive conduct undertaken by ANHINC and the breaches by AMG should be attributed to the plaintiff. The defendants cited in support of this submissionKumagaiGumi Co Ltd v Zenecon Pte Ltd and others and other appeals[1995] 2 SLR(R) 304 (“Kumagai”) at [57].53Foot Note 53×DWS at paras 125–127. 32 The defendants enumerated a list of factors for why they considered ANHINC, AMG and the plaintiff to be one and the same. These include,inter alia, the following: (a) The plaintiff does not have its own premises and uses the same business office as that of AMG.54Foot Note 54×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 11. (b) AMG does not have its own website and shares the same website as the plaintiff.55Foot Note 55×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 11. (c) The plaintiff considers the Vessel as a part of its own fleet even though the Vessel belongs to AVI, whose majority shareholder is ANHINC and not the plaintiff.56Foot Note 56×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 12. (d) The plaintiff’s CEO Bill Wong communicated with the defendants using e-mail accounts bearing the name of AMG.57Foot Note 57×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 12. (e) AMG and the plaintiff share common directors and have the same executive officers. Bill Wong is the CEO of both the plaintiff and AMG, and was also a director of AVI. The key employees of the plaintiff and/or ANHINC and/or AMG were based in the UAE, such as Bill Wong himself.58Foot Note 58×DWS at para 125. (f) The plaintiff actively controls and manages AMG.59Foot Note 59×DWS at para 13(i). (g) The plaintiff’s 2019 annual report also states that the plaintiff’s operations are managed mainly through AMG and another entity.60Foot Note 60×BAEIC at Tab 1, p 242. (h) ANHINC is merely a holding company with no business of its own.61Foot Note 61×DWS at para 13.The plaintiff controls the board of ANHINC. ANHINC does not have its own bank account, but uses the plaintiff’s bank account to transfer funds on behalf of ANHINC. (i) The plaintiff’s operations were managed by AMG.62Foot Note 62×DWS at para 127. 33 The defendants hence submitted that the oppressive acts of ANHINC as a shareholder of AVI and the contractual breaches of AMG in relation to the SMA are relevant to whether the plaintiff has the right to seek contribution. 34 The plaintiff’s position is that it is not a party to the Shareholders’ Agreement. The parties to the Shareholders’ Agreement are the second defendant and ANHINC. The plaintiff is also not a party to the SMA. The parties to the SMA are AVI and AMG. Hence, by virtue of the principle of privity, the alleged acts and breaches by ANHINC and AMG do not concern the plaintiff, and are thus irrelevant to determining whether the plaintiff is entitled to payment as a co-guarantor. 35 With respect to the defendants’ claim that the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are the same entity, the plaintiff submits that each incorporated entity is a separate legal entity.63Foot Note 63×PWS at paras 27–28.This remains the case even if the companies are within the same group, and even if the plaintiff owns all the shares in the ANHINC and ANHINC is the sole asset of the plaintiff.64Foot Note 64×PWS at para 30.The court should not lift the corporate veil unless it is shown that the subsidiary is the alter ego of the parent company.65Foot Note 65×PWS at para 29. 36 As for the Vessel, the plaintiff submitted that it had not treated the Vessel as a part of its own fleet. The plaintiff pointed to the Vessel Fleet List in the plaintiff’s Annual Report 2019, identifying the Vessel as “Under management with 51% ownership under Investment in Joint Operation”, which accurately reflects the extent of ownership of ANHINC in AVI.66Foot Note 66×PWS at para 31. 37 The plaintiff further denied that it exercised control in the management of ANHINC and/or AMG. Bill Wong, the CEO and director of the plaintiff, testified that he did not personally control any of the three companies, namely the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG.67Foot Note 67×NE 24/3/2021 at p 13, lines 6–17.Each of these companies has its own operating profile.68Foot Note 68×NE 24/3/2021 at p 13, lines 12–13.Even though there is common directorship amongst the three companies, Bill Wong wore different hats and acted accordingly.69Foot Note 69×NE 24/3/2021 at p 13, lines 29–32.The plaintiff is a listed company run by a board of directors. It is an investment company but that does not mean it necessarily controls the activities of the subsidiaries it owns.70Foot Note 70×NE 24/3/2021 at p 14, lines 5–9.In any event, the defendants would have done their due diligence before entering into the joint venture with ANHINC, such that they would have been aware of the group structure, including the relationship between the plaintiff and AMG. Such information is readily available on the plaintiff’s website. There is no basis for the defendants to now assert that the plaintiff, AMG and/or ANHINC are the same entity.71Foot Note 71×PWS at para 35. Whether there were oppressive acts by ANHINC and AMG 38 The defendants submitted that the plaintiff’s conduct, through AMG’s breaches of the SMA and ANHINC’s oppressive conduct towards the second defendant as a shareholder of AVI, renders it inequitable for the plaintiff to claim for contribution.72Foot Note 72×DWS at para 123. 39 The defendants submitted that there was oppression arising from AVI’s exclusion of the second defendant from the management of AVI and the failure to sell the Vessel, and the second defendant’s inability to terminate the SMA between AVI and AMG (as the second defendant is a minority shareholder of AVI),73Foot Note 73×DWS at para 19.particularly in light of multiple breaches of the SMA by AMG and/or ANHINC and/or the plaintiff.74Foot Note 74×DWS at para 128; BAEIC at Tab 1, pp 13–20.These breaches include: (a) failure to obtain AVI’s approval for all charter contracts that were entered into after 2015, as required by cl 3.3 of the SMA, which essentially provides that AMG has the authority to fix charter contracts that are for a period of three months or shorter so long as they are not below a certain rate, and that AMG shall seek the approval of AVI for other charter contracts; (b) accepting charter hire rates which were significantly lower than the rate of about US$8,500.00 per day, which AVI had anticipated, without obtaining AVI’s approval beforehand, breaching cl 3.3 of the SMA; (c) failure to provide AVI with regular quarterly reports on the Vessel, breaching cl 4 of the SMA; (d) failure to provide AVI with revised management fees on a yearly basis since 2017, breaching cl 8.2 of the SMA; (e) failure to provide AVI with an operation budget on a yearly basis since 2016, breaching cl 9.1 of the SMA; (f) failure to ensure that a back-to-back charter party agreement was signed for each charter party agreement signed between AMG and the charter hirers in respect of the Vessel, breaching cl 21 of the SMA; and (g) failure to transfer the charter hire to AVI’s account within two working days upon receipt of the same from the charters, breaching cl 22 of the SMA.75Foot Note 75×BAEIC at Tab 1, pp 13–16. 40 The defendants submitted that there were also oppressive acts in relation to the Vessel, including,inter alia, the failure by AMG to disclose the terms of the charter party agreements to AVI, AMG causing an increase in AVI’s operating expenses, AMG’s use of the Vessel without AVI’s prior authorisation, AVI’s failure to sell the Vessel to mitigate the losses of AVI, and ANHINC’s two-year delay in obtaining the Bank’s banking token to facilitate the transfer of funds to AVI.76Foot Note 76×DWS at para 22; BAEIC at Tab 1, pp 15–20. 41 The nub of the defendants’ complaint is that the joint venture has not been profitable owing to the plaintiff’s mismanagement, and that the Vessel should have been sold.77Foot Note 77×DWS at para 153.The second defendant had engaged a broker for the sale of the Vessel since 2019, but ANHINC and/or the plaintiff rejected the offers made by prospective buyers.78Foot Note 78×DWS at paras 34–37.Hence, as a result of ANHINC’s unreasonable delay, AVI incurred further debt, which could have been mitigated if the Vessel were sold to repay the overdue instalments under the Facility Agreement. Hence, the failure by ANHINC and/or the plaintiff to sell the Vessel also created unfairness such that the plaintiff’s claim should not be allowed.79Foot Note 79×DWS at para 153. 42 The defendants submitted that because of the oppressive conduct by the plaintiff, the plaintiff has not come to the court with clean hands, and is thus not entitled to seek contribution from the defendants.80Foot Note 80×DWS at paras 132. 43 The plaintiff disputed that there were oppressive acts. It submitted that even if there were oppressive acts, the second defendant has not suffered any prejudice. The SMA was negotiated at arm’s length between AVI and AMG. The SMA allows AVI to terminate on both non-fault and fault bases.81Foot Note 81×PWS at para 46.While the second defendant claimed that it could not terminate the SMA unilaterally, there was no evidence that the issue of termination had ever been raised with ANHINC or that ANHINC had rejected a request by the second defendant for termination.82Foot Note 82×PWS at para 54; NE 25/3/2021 at p 145, lines 24–32. 44 As for the alleged breaches of the SMA, the plaintiff’s submissions were as follows: (a) AMG did provide AVI with an operation budget for 2017 and 2018.83Foot Note 83×CB at p 961.While AMG had not provided AVI with an detailed operation budget for every year since 2016, there were separate discussions between shareholders of AVI, where an agreement was reached on the broad strokes of the budget.84Foot Note 84×NE 25/3/2021 at p 42, lines 29-–32.The first defendant was involved in those discussions, as evidenced by his subsequent e-mails acknowledging such discussions.85Foot Note 85×CB at p 951. (b) There were back-to-back charters between AVI and AMG.86Foot Note 86×NE 24/3/2021 at p 66, lines 10–12; CB at p 338.Where there were no back-to-back charters, it was inconsequential because the charter terms were made known to AVI, as such information would be presented in the accounts.87Foot Note 87×NE 24/3/2021 at p 64, lines 26–32. (c) The charter hire was not remitted to AVI’s account because AMG had pre-funded the operations. The charter hire was then used to pay for the arrears in the operating expenses, and the balance was sent back to AVI’s account, which was used to pay the instalments due under the Facility Agreement.88Foot Note 88×NE 24/3/2021 at p 46, lines 13–18; BAEIC at p 637, Row “D”, “Atlantic Maritime Group FZE – Payment to the Bank”.Such operating expenses related to the crew expenses.89Foot Note 89×NE 24/3/2021 at p 45, lines 13–23,Hence, it was not possible for the entire charter hire to be paid to AVI, as operating expenses of the Vessel had to be paid.90Foot Note 90×PWS at para 52. (d) While there were breaches of the SMA by AMG, there were also breaches by AVI, who failed to pre-fund the operations of the Vessel as required under the SMA.91Foot Note 91×NE 24/3/2021 at p 42, lines 18–27; BAEIC at p 637. (e) There were times where the Vessel was used without AVI’s authorisation, but AVI was informed as to when and who the charterers were. AVI would be notified of the charterparties.92Foot Note 92×PWS at p 55. (f) The charter rates were significantly lower than anticipated because of a downturn in the marine industry. (g) There was no breach of cl 4 of the SMA as AMG was not obliged to provide quarterly reports. AMG’s obligation was to provide the income and expense statements only.93Foot Note 93×NE 24/3/2021 at p 72, lines 13–15.AMG also did not breach cl 8.2 of the SMA as it did provide a reduced management fee at the defendants’ request.94Foot Note 94×CB at p 1213. 45 The plaintiff’s case is that while there were lapses by AMG, there was no detriment to AVI, as these lapses were not serious, and AMG continued to manage the Vessel well despite the market conditions. There was no detriment to AVI, as AMG achieved utilisation rates ranging between 50% to 73% from 2015 to 2019.95Foot Note 95×PWS at para 55.Some of the lapses did not prejudice AVI. For instance, while there was some delay in obtaining the bank token to facilitate the transfer of funds to AVI, which was issued in 2017,96Foot Note 96×NE 24/3/2021 at p 81, lines 21–23.AMG did remit the surplus of the charter hire by the Vessel to AVI after the token was received.97Foot Note 97×NE 24/3/2021 at p 81, line 28.Actions were taken when complaints against AMG were lodged. According to Bill Wong, the second defendant did not raise the issue of termination of the SMA in board meetings, despite having had the opportunity to do so in board meetings98Foot Note 98×PWS at para 55; NE 24/3/2021 at p 39, lines 22–23.(on the first defendant’s own evidence, there were at least two meetings in the past)99Foot Note 99×NE 25/3/2021 at p 84.. The reason why the second defendant did not raise the issue of termination is that there was no truth in the alleged breaches, and/or that the alleged breaches were inconsequential.100Foot Note 100×PWS at para 57.Bill Wong also attested that the other alleged oppressive acts, such as ANHINC’s failure to provide documents, were never brought up to the AVI board, or through the shareholders’ forum.101Foot Note 101×NE 24/3/2021 at p 41, lines 16–17.Instead, the second defendant went along with AMG, as it did not have to put in funds to AMG for the operational expenses of AVI, even though that was required under the SMA.102Foot Note 102×PWS at para 80(a). 46 As for the defendants’ claim that the Vessel ought to be sold, the plaintiff’s position is that the defendants are not entitled to insist that the Vessel be sold.103Foot Note 103×PWS at paras 76–78.As held by the court inKPMGServices Pte Ltd v Pawley, Mark Edward[2021] SGHC 54 at [103] (“KPMGv Pawley”), citingChan Siew Lee Jannie v Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd[2016] 3 SLR 239 at [36], a surety has no right to require the creditor to proceed against the principal or any security provided for the debt before proceeding against himself. Further, even if the Vessel was sold, there is no confirmation that the sale proceeds would be sufficient to pay AVI’s creditors.104Foot Note 104×PWS at para 79. 47 The plaintiff submitted that there was no delay in the sale of the Vessel. Bill Wong’s evidence was that in or around 2017, the market conditions were bad. If the Vessel had been sold at that point, AVI would have received a low price while the remaining bank loan was high.105Foot Note 105×NE 24/3/2021 at p 102, lines 2–7.In 2019, while the remaining loan was lower, the offer was US$1.9m. Taking into account what the shareholders have put in, this was not an attractive proposition.106Foot Note 106×NE 25/3/2021 at p 11, lines 10–26.As the majority shareholder, ANHINC also had an interest to make sure that the proceeds of sale from the Vessel should be adequate to clear the debts of AVI.107Foot Note 107×NE 25/3/2021at p 5, line 18.Moreover, the offer of US$1.9m was not a firm one. No inspection took place, and the potential buyer might simply have lost interest, as accepted by the first defendant during cross-examination.108Foot Note 108×NE 26/3/2021 at p 51, lines 6–31.The defendants’ claim that it was difficult to carry out inspection for prospective buyers was not pleaded nor stated in any communications the first defendant relied on. Instead, what was clear was that ANHINC had facilitated inspections of the Vessel when the Vessel was not out on charter. If the Vessel was chartered, it would not be in the interest of AVI to jeopardise a charter by bringing it back for an inspection that may not materialise.109Foot Note 109×NE 25/3/2021 at p 50, lines 16–18; NE 25/3/2021 at p 51, lines 1–12.",
        "My decision": "Whether the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are one and the same 48 I find the defendants’ allegations relating to the conduct of AMG and ANHINC irrelevant to this Suit. The plaintiff is not a party to the SMA between AVI and AMG or the Shareholders’ Agreement between the second defendant and ANHINC. The defendants have not established that the plaintiff, ANHINC and AMG are one and the same, such that their separate legal personalities should be disregarded. 49 The law on this is common ground among the parties. One ground for lifting the corporate veil and disregarding the separate legal personalities of ANHINC and AMG is to show that the subsidiary company is carrying on the business of its controller: seeNEC Asia Pte Ltd(now known as NEC Asia Pacific Pte Ltd) v Picket & Rail Asia Pacific Pte Ltdand others[2011] 2 SLR 565 at [31]. There is no presumption that a subsidiary is the parent company’s alter ego: seeWin Line (UK) Ltd vMasterpart (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another[1999] 2 SLR(R) 24 at [43]. 50 InMiller Freeman Exhibitions Pte Ltd v Singapore Industrial Automation Association and another[2000] 3 SLR(R) 177 (“Miller Freeman”),the Court of Appeal noted that the indicia adumbrated inSmith, Stone and Knight, Ltd v Lord Mayor, Aldermen and Citizens of the City ofBirmingham[1939] 4 All ER 116, such as whether the subsidiary company’s profits were treated as entirely those of the parent company’s, whether the subsidiary had no staff of its own and whether the parent governed the business of the subsidiary, were helpful guidelines but by no means a conclusive and definitive test in determining whether a business is carried out by the subsidiary as the principal or agent for its holding company. The Court of Appeal observed that in some cases, such as inMiller Freeman, there were other circumstances to be taken into account. In that case, the second respondent was a wholly owned subsidiary of the first respondent. The appellant sued the first respondent, arguing that the first and second respondents were the same party. The Court of Appeal found at [19]–[23] that even though the second respondent shared the same office address, and the first respondent managed and controlled the second respondent, it did not necessarily follow that the second respondent was acting as the agent of the respondent, or that they were one and the same party. The respondents were entitled to utilise the corporate structure by setting up a company to limit its liability and risk. This must have been known to the appellants who decided to do business with the second respondent. Whether the corporate veil should be lifted is thus very much an inquiry taking into account the circumstances of the particular case. 51 In this case, I find that the defendants have not shown that ANHINC and AMG are the alter egos of the parent company. While the plaintiff wholly owns ANHINC and AMG, this does not render the latter two the alter egos of the parent company. The factors relied on by the defendants – for example, the plaintiff and AMG’s sharing of websites and office space, Bill Wong being CEO for both AMG and the plaintiff, and ANHINC utilising the bank account of AMG and the plaintiff to conduct business – do not in themselves mean that ANHINC and AMG are carrying on the business of the plaintiff as the plaintiff’s agent or alter egos. There is similarly no evidence that ANHINC was operating as a vehicle of the plaintiff in managing AVI  or issues relating to AVI’s sale of the Vessel (as set out above in [39] and [41]). I also accept Bill Wong’s evidence that each of the companies has its own operating profile, that AMG has its own team running its business, and AMG has existed before the plaintiff was incorporated.110Foot Note 110×NE 24/3/2021 at p 13, lines 8–17.In addition, the group structure of the plaintiff was known to the defendants when the second defendant entered into the joint venture with ANHINC and entered into the SMA with AMG. The plaintiff is entitled to utilise such group structure to structure its business. 52 The defendants’ reference toKumagaidoes not assist them. First,Kumagaiconcerned oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act. Here, the defendants conceded that they were not relying on s 216 of the Companies Act, as the second defendant is a foreign company. Second, the defendants cited [57] ofKumagaiin support of their case.But the holding at [57]–[58] is that Low did not sufficiently take into account the interests of his principal KZ, for whom he was serving as nominee director on the board of KPM (a subsidiary of KZ). The Court of Appeal found that when Low carried on the business of KPM, serving only his interest and in disregard of the interest of his principal KZ, he acted in breach of his duty to his principal KZ. There is no suggestion here by the defendants that any of the directors of AVI were not acting in the interest of their principal. Third, when the Court of Appeal observed at [44] that counsel had adopted too legalistic an approach in relying on the separate legal personalities of KZ and KPM, it was in the context of the court’s finding that KPM did not operate independently of KZ. Thus, the Court of Appeal observed at [59] that “subsidiaries come in all shapes and sizes; some are truly independent, while others are not”, and that on the facts, KPM had been used by Low as a mere vehicle of KZ. In contrast, for the reasons stated above in this judgment at [51], I do not find on the evidence presented by the defendants that AMG or ANHINC were used as mere vehicles of the plaintiff, or that ANHINC, AMG and the plaintiff have been managed as one, such that their separate legal personalities should be disregarded. Whether there were oppressive acts by AMG and ANHINC 53 As I have found that there is no ground to pierce the corporate veil to consider these group companies as one entity, the issue of whether there are oppressive acts by AMG or by ANHINC is not relevant to the defendants’ resistance to contribution. However, for completeness I have also examined, assuming that the corporate veil is pierced, whether the acts are indeed oppressive, such that they should prevent the plaintiff from seeking contribution from the defendants. 54 As a preliminary point, I observe that both the Shareholders’ Agreement and the SMA require any disputes arising out of those agreements to be resolved by arbitration. The second defendant is a party to the Shareholders’ Agreement and is not constrained in any way from referring disputes thereunder to arbitration. But it has not done so at any point to the proper forum. It has instead bypassed the arbitration provisions to raise its grievances here and now. Similarly, as a shareholder of AVI, the second defendant could have sought arbitration between AVI and AMG for the alleged breaches of the SMA, arbitration being the agreed and proper forum for their disputes. But the second defendant has never raised this with the board of AVI, and has instead bypassed the proper forum of arbitration to raise those grievances in this suit. (1) Alleged breaches of the SMA 55 On the facts, even though there were some breaches of the SMA by AMG in relation to the chartering of the Vessel, they did not prejudice the defendants, nor did they render it unfair for the plaintiff to seek contribution from the defendants: (a) The failure by AMG to enter into back-to-back charters was not prejudicial, as AVI was informed of the charterparties entered into by AMG. Where the Vessel was used without AVI’s authorisation, AVI was notified of the charterparties. (b) The failure to provide AVI with an operation budget was not prejudicial. I accept Bill Wong’s evidence that there were subsequent discussions with AVI shareholders, who were informed of the operation budget and approved it. This is supported by the first defendant’s own correspondence to Bill Wong. (c) The delay in obtaining the banking token was remedied as the token was issued in 2017. In any event, the breach was not so material as to render it inequitable for the plaintiff to seek contribution, as AMG remitted the surplus of the charter hire to AVI thereafter. 56 If the second defendant found the alleged breaches of AMG prejudicial or unfair, it could have raised this during AVI’s board meetings, but it did not do so. The first defendant attested that there were at least two board meetings in the past.111Foot Note 111×NE 25/3/2021 at p 84.The first defendant also agreed that there was a board meeting on 1 July 2019, where Bill Wong proposed that AVI’s board could discuss the issue of AMG’s performance as a ship manager, and then decide whether AVI would continue with the current SMA.112Foot Note 112×NE 25/3/2021 at p 86, lines 12–17; CB at p 1212.During the meeting, the first defendant discussed the issue of AMG’s performance. His evidence is that the discussion “went beyond the termination of the ship management agreement”, as he had suggested that AVI should sell the Vessel, given the high operating expenses incurred.113Foot Note 113×NE 25/3/2021 at p 102, lines 13–14, 21–23; NE 25/3/2021 at p 112, lines 21–23. 57 There is thus no evidence that the first defendant sought to terminate the SMA at the board meeting even though Bill Wong had suggested such an option. Instead, the first defendant claimed that it would not have been possible for the defendants to raise the issue of termination because the plaintiff and/or ANHINC would not have considered it.114Foot Note 114×NE 25/3/2021 at p 102, lines 4–5.The defendants’ case, therefore, is not that they tried to but were prevented by ANHINC from terminating the SMA, but rather thattheythought theywould not havebeen able tohave AVI terminate the SMA, as the second defendant was merely the minority shareholder in AVI with 49% of the shares.115Foot Note 115×DWS at para 115.However, this is speculation on the part of the defendants. What the evidence does bear out is that the first defendant did not raise the issue of termination; rather, the first defendant simply, in his words, “went beyond” this issue to discuss instead the sale of the Vessel. There is also evidence that the first defendant was aware of these alleged breaches, and that he was unhappy with AMG’s alleged mismanagement from around 2015,116Foot Note 116×NE 25/3/2021 at p 104, lines 9-–12; NE 25/3/2021 at p 112.and yet no action was taken to terminate the SMA. If the alleged breaches are as consequential as the defendants now make them out to be, why did they not take action on them all these years? (2) The failure to sell the Vessel 58 I also find that the fact that the Vessel has not been sold is not due to oppressive acts by AMG and/or ANHINC. First, there is no evidence that the plaintiff, AMG and/or ANHINC prevented or delayed such a sale. When the Vessel was not chartered and inspections were possible, AMG facilitated such inspections.117Foot Note 117×NE 25/3/2021 at p 50.There were prospective buyers with tentative offers in 2019. The fact that no sale materialised could not be attributed to any oppression by ANHINC or the plaintiff. As the first defendant has acknowledged, one prospective buyer made an offer for US$1.9m made in December 2019, but lost interest thereafter. The prospective buyer did not request an inspection,118Foot Note 118×NE 25/3/2021 at pp 51–52; BAEIC at p 218.so it could not be said that ANHINC and/or AMG had prevented any inspection from taking place. Bill Wong testified that his approach was that if the Vessel were chartered, in the absence of a firm offer, he would not jeopardise a charter which had contractual obligations attached, to satisfy a prospective buyer whose purchase may not materialise. This cannot be said to be a decision that was against the interest of AVI, or in any way oppressive to the second defendant. 59 Second, the evidence is that for the offers that were closer to materialising, there was commercial reason for AVI not to sell at that price, even if the offers became firm. For the offer in 2019, where the tentative offer was US$1.9m, the price was not sufficient to clear all the debts of AVI. I accepted Bill Wong’s evidence that it would be in neither ANHINC’s nor the second defendant’s interests to force a sale that would still leave outstanding debt to AVI’s creditors. Again, his assessment cannot be said to be against the interest of AVI or in any way oppressive to the second defendant. 60 Neither could it be said that it was oppressive of ANHINC to continue with the Vessel’s operation when the operating expenses were above US$3,000 per day. The shareholders of AVI agreed to make contributions to AVI of US$135,000 each on a quarterly basis, on the budget estimation of US$3,000 per day of operating expenses, to fund the running of the Vessel. Since the operating expenses were higher than expected, the defendants submitted that Vessel should have been sold to discontinue the loss-making venture of AVI.119Foot Note 119×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at paras 50–52.However, this issue is not material as I have found that AHNINC and AMG did not obstruct any attempts to sell the Vessel. The fact that the Vessel was not sold could not be attributed to any oppression by AHNINC and AMG. 61 In any event, the defendant accepted that the actual operating expenses amounted to US$3,591.52 per day,120Foot Note 120×Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 51.which is not far off from the budgeted figure of US$3,000 per day. Further, as Bill Wong has attested, which I accept, the operating expenses figure discussed here was ultimately an estimate, and much depended on the actual operation of the Vessel.121Foot Note 121×NE 25/03/2021 at pp 40–41.The figure of US$3,000 of operating expenses per day was made on the premise of 100% utilisation.122Foot Note 122×NE 24/03/2021 at pp 73, 107; CB at p 73.The actual expenses would likely exceed this amount where there was no 100% utilisation, and the operating expenses of similar vessels in the market were in the region of US$4,500 and above.123Foot Note 123×CB at p 1206.I therefore find that the actual operating expenses of the Vessel were within a reasonable range, such that the continued operation of the Vessel was not oppressive to the defendants. 62 Third, that the Bank could have enforced the security by selling the Vessel to re-pay the loan does not assist the defendants’ case. It is well established in case law (seeKPMGv Pawleyat [103]) that a surety has no right to require the creditor to proceed against the principal or any security provided for the debt guaranteed before proceeding against himself.",
        "Issue 2: Whether the Bank must call on the guarantors to make payment first before a guarantor’s entitlement for contribution arises": "",
        "Issue 3: Whether the alleged oppression by ANHINC and the contractual breaches by AMG are relevant to the defendants resisting contribution": "",
        "Conclusion": "63 The defendants essentially seek to resist the plaintiff’s claim for contribution on the grounds that it is inequitable for the plaintiff to do so. However, having assessed the overall evidence, I do not find that it is inequitable for the plaintiff to seek contribution from the defendants. The defendants allege that the mismanagement by AMG has caused the Vessel to bring in poor returns. However, they do not deny that the Vessel has brought in returns of about US$2.15m, which has contributed to the repayment of the US$8.4m loan.124Foot Note 124×NE 24/3/2021 at p 46, lines 13-–18; BAEIC at p 637 at Row D.This has reduced the contributions needed by the second defendant, as shareholders of AVI, to keep the loan afloat, and reduced the potential liability of the first defendant as a co-guarantor. Moreover, it is undisputed that such returns were generated through AMG’s management of the Vessel, and that AVI owed management fees to AMG to the tune of $915,512 as of 30 September 2020.125Foot Note 125×BAEIC at p 637 at Row I=E+F+G+H.For all the litany of complaints that the defendants have regarding AVI, AMG, ANHINC and the plaintiff, which according to the first defendant started since 2015, the defendants have never brought any action against AVI for minority shareholder oppression, nor did they actively seek to have the board of AVI deal with the alleged breaches of AMG or terminate the SMA with AMG. 64 In conclusion, I find that the plaintiff is entitled to its claim for: (a) a declaration that the defendants are jointly and severally liable to contribute to the amounts paid or to be paid by the plaintiff under the Guarantees; (b) the sum of US$510.946,55 or severally the sum of US$255,473.28 being rateably the defendants’ proportion of the sums due under their respective Guarantees; and (c) interest at 5.33% per annum from each of the three payments due dates set out in [12] of the Statement of Claim (ie31 May 2019, 30 August 2019 and 29 November 2019) until the date of judgment pursuant to s 12(1) of the Civil Law Act. 65 I will hear the parties on costs.   Kwek Mean LuckJudicial Commissioner  Yoga Sharmini, Subashini N, Peh Kai Sen Eli (Haridass Ho & Partners) for the plaintiff; Mathiew Christophe Rajoo, Tharanii Thiyagarajan (Dennismathiew) for the defendants."
