        "Finding on liability": "23     The defendant’s conviction on her own\n                    plea for the offence of driving without due care and attention, and the\n                    Statement of Facts that she admitted to, were relevant facts before me. They\n                    were relevant under s 45A of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev\n                    Ed) which states that: (1) … the fact that a person has been convicted or acquitted of an\n                        offence by or before any court in Singapore shall be admissible in evidence\n                        for the purpose of proving, where relevant to any issue in the proceedings,\n                        that he committed (or, as the case may be, did not commit) that offence,\n                        whether or not he is a party to the proceedings; and where he was convicted,\n                        whether he was so convicted upon a plea of guilty or otherwise. 24     In her evidence the defendant described the\n                    careless way in which the three girls tried to cross the road, but she did not\n                    go back on her previous admission or deny that she had driven her car without\n                    due care and attention. Although she was entitled to explain her plea, all that\n                    she said was that she had pleaded guilty because she felt bad that the accident\n                    happened. 25     At the trial, the defendant said that she\n                    first saw the three girls when they were in the centre lane of the first half of\n                    the pedestrian crossing[note: 13]and she thought\n                    that they were going to stop at the centre of the road, but they continued to\n                    cross over to the second half of the pedestrian crossing[note: 14]and when she saw them crossing,\n                    she thought she could drive pass them by accelerating her car[note: 15]instead of slowing down or\n                    stopping her car. 26     The duty on a motorist who is approaching a\n                    junction was examined inOng Bee Nah v Won Siew Wan (Yong\n                        Tian Choy, third party)[2005] 2 SLR(R) 455 where\n                    Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC stated (at [95]): … It seems to me that there is - in the absence of clear and\n                        compelling circumstances to the contrary - no legal duty on a driver to slow\n                        down automatically each time he or she approaches a junction if there is no\n                        stop sign or (as is the case here) the lights are in his or her favour at a\n                        junction where traffic lights are present. [emphasis in original] and cited Lord Dunedin’s statement inFardon\n                        v Harcourt-Rivington(1932) 146 LT 391 at 392\n                    that: … If the possibility of the danger emerging is reasonably apparent,\n                        then to take no precautions is negligence; but if the possibility of danger\n                        emerging is only a mere possibility which would never occur to the mind of a\n                        reasonable man, then there is no negligence in not having taken\n                        extraordinary precautions. 27     I find the defendant negligent on her evidence\n                    that she saw the girls trying to cross the pedestrian crossing. She should have\n                    realised the possibility of danger and slowed down her car, but she did not do\n                    that because she was driving without due care and attention. 28     That leaves the question of contributory\n                    negligence by the deceased. On the evidence, she had contributed to the\n                    accident. She had not only ignored the red pedestrian crossing light, but was\n                    running across the path of the defendant’s car when the collision took\n                    place. 29     Counsel for the plaintiffs had contended that\n                    “Whether the traffic lights was [sic]\n                    showing “red man” or “blinking green man” at the\n                    time of the accident is irrelevant.”[note: 16]That assertion was made in reliance on r 7 of the Road Traffic (Pedestrian\n                    Crossings) Rules 1982 (S 295/1982): Precedence for pedestrian at controlled crossing. 7.    Wherever there is a pedestrian crossing at a road\n                            intersection or junction where traffic is controlled by a police officer\n                            or by light signals, every pedestrian who is about to enter or has\n                            entered such crossing shall be permitted free and uninterrupted passage\n                            over the crossing by all drivers of vehicles who are approaching the\n                            crossing notwithstanding that such drivers may have already received a\n                            signal to proceed either from the light signals or the police officer,\n                            as the case may be. 30     The effect of the rule was misunderstood.\n                    While the rule confers on pedestrians at pedestrian crossings the right of way,\n                    it is a serious error to take that to mean that the pedestrian can cross with\n                    impunity without regard to the state of the lights, or that the pedestrian does\n                    not owe a duty to himself or herself, and to other road-users, to abide by the\n                    lights. 31     That duty was clearly established inNg Weng Cheong v Soh Oh Loo and another[1993]\n                    1 SLR(R) 532 (“Ng Weng\n                    Cheong”) which arose out of a somewhat similar fact situation.\n                    In that case, a pedestrian tried to cross a road at a pedestrian crossing when\n                    the red man was on, and he was knocked down by a bus. The trial court found that\n                    the bus driver was not negligent and the pedestrian’s appeal to the High\n                    Court was dismissed on the ground that the bus driver had a right to presume\n                    when the pedestrian crossing light was red that his way was clear. The Court of\n                    Appeal disagreed with the appellate judge and held (at [39]) that: 39    … [T]he fact that it is an offence for a\n                            pedestrian to cross a controlled crossing against light signals, in our\n                            view, does make a difference in this way. The fact that it is an offence\n                            means that drivers of vehicles in general have less reason to anticipate\n                            such occurrences, although, as we pointed out earlier, such occurrences\n                            cannot in reality be ruled out altogether. For the pedestrian, it also\n                            means that the danger inherent in such behaviour is that much greater.A person who crosses a light-controlled crossing\n                                in disobedience of a light signal applicable to him thus assumes a\n                                high degree of contributory negligence. [emphasis added] and apportioned liability for the accident at 70% for the pedestrian\n                    and 30% for the bus driver. 32     There are differences in the facts of that\n                    case and the facts of the present case. Firstly, the defendant had not said that\n                    her view of the deceased was obstructed. Secondly, whereas the deceased ran\n                    across the road after Chan’s car had sounded its horn, the pedestrian inNg Weng Cheongwas walking across the\n                    crossing, and there was no horning. 33     In apportioning liability in an accident case,\n                    a court has to take into account all the relevant facts and the precedent\n                    apportionments. Having done that, I find the defendant to be 30% responsible for\n                    the collision and the deceased to be 70% responsible.",
        "Findings on damages": "34     After having decided on the question of\n                    liability, the damages have to be addressed. As there was no agreement on any of\n                    the heads of damages. I shall consider each head separately.",
        "Dependency claims": "35     Dependency claims were made by the\n                    deceased’s father Kim Anseok and mother Jeon Sangsun, who are the first\n                    and second plaintiffs, and for her younger brother. When the deceased died at\n                    the age of 15 in 2005, the ages of her dependants were: Father – 42 years Mother – 39\n                        years Brother – 8 years 36     The two elements to such claims, the\n                    multipliers and the multiplicands have to be dealt with.",
        "Multipliers": "37     The plaintiffs submitted that the multipliers\n                    should be[note: 17]: Father – 12 years Mother – 13\n                        years Brother – 5 years from the time\n                    the deceased would have completed her High School education in 2010 and have\n                    started playing badminton professionally. 38     Counsel for the defendant submitted that a\n                    uniform multiplier of 10 years be applied for all the dependents. The\n                    defendants’ proposal is incorrect in principle because it failed to\n                    consider the differences in the relationship between the dependents and the\n                    deceased, and the circumstances of each dependent – seeLing Kee Ling and another v Leow Leng Siong and others[1994]\n                    3 SLR(R) 395 at [8]. A person like the deceased may support a brother\n                    until he is able to support himself, but she may support her parents during\n                    their lifetimes or for so long as she is able to do that. 39     The deceased’s father was working as a\n                    construction worker after his small business in kitchen sinks failed. Her mother\n                    had worked as a kitchen assistant, but could not continue after her\n                    daughter’s death, and her brother was schooling. 40     On the plaintiffs’ proposed multipliers,\n                    the deceased would have supported her parents and brother from the time she\n                    starts working in 2010 up to the time they reached the following ages: Father – 59 years Mother – 57\n                        years Brother – 18 years in the year\n                    2023, when the deceased would have been 33 years old. 41     Although there was no evidence adduced on the\n                    life expectancy of South Koreans, there is no reason to suppose that the parents\n                    are not expected to reach these ages, or that the brother would not need\n                    financial support before he reached 18 years old. 42     The question is whether the deceased can\n                    reasonably be expected to support them up to the time she was 33 years old. I\n                    find this probable, as she would have the means to support them. 43     The plaintiff had also apportioned the\n                    deceased’s projected family contributions between the dependants\n                    as: Father – 40% Mother – 40% Brother – 20% 44     The apportionment was unexceptional. However,\n                    the plaintiffs went on to set out the dependents’ entitlements\n                        as:[note: 18] (a)    40% of the Deceased’s multiplicand for the\n                            first 5 years of the [father’s] dependency and 50% of the\n                            Deceased’s multiplicand for the next 7 years of the\n                            [father’s] dependency; (b)    40% of the Deceased’s multiplicand for the\n                            first 5 years of the [mother’s] dependency and 50% of the\n                            Deceased’s multiplicand for the next 8 years of the\n                            [mother’s] dependency; and (c)    20% of the Deceased’s multiplicand for the 5\n                            years of [the brother’s] dependency. The effect of that formulation is that when the brother’s\n                    20% dependency entitlement ends, that is to be transferred to each of his\n                    parents equally. (But when the father’s dependency entitlement ends, it is\n                    not transferred to the mother.) The plaintiffs did not explain why they think\n                    that the brother’s entitlement is to be transferred but not the\n                    father’s entitlement. 45     This raised the question whether dependency\n                    entitlements are transferrable. The plaintiffs did not cite any authority to\n                    show that they are. I do not see any basis to suppose that when the deceased\n                    stopped supporting her brother, she would pay his entitlement to her parents.\n                    Similarly, when one parent dies, there is no reason to pay the deceased\n                    parent’s share to the surviving parent. The dependency claims should be\n                    computed on each dependent’s entitlement, and the entitlements are not\n                    transferrable.",
        "The multiplicand": "46     As the deceased died before she had started\n                    working, the fixing of the multiplicand will involve a significant element of\n                    projection. 47     The plaintiffs put forth the multiplicand on\n                    the premise that the deceased would continue to play badminton and make that her\n                    profession if she had not died. The defendant, on the other hand, put forward\n                    its computation based on published reports on the earning prospects of fresh\n                    college graduates, although there was no suggestion that the deceased would have\n                    enrolled into college. 48     The plaintiffs’ approach is more\n                    appropriate. While there may be less data on the earnings of professional\n                    badminton players than on the earning powers of college students, it is\n                    preferable to rely on the relevant information that is available, than to refer\n                    to a greater pool of information which has no relation to the deceased’s\n                    circumstances. 49     The plaintiffs called several witnesses who\n                    knew the deceased and were able to give evidence on her projected earnings. Kim\n                    Bum Sik (“Kim”) was the head badminton coach in the\n                    deceased’s school, Sung Ji Girls’ Middle School. He had coached the\n                    deceased personally. He confirmed that the deceased had been a national junior\n                    team player in 2004 and 2005, and he was convinced that she would have been a\n                    national player at the time of the trial in 2009 if she were alive, and may\n                    qualify for the 2012 Olympic Games. 50     On the professional outlook for a young\n                    badminton player like the deceased, Kim deposed that it was likely that the\n                    deceased upon leaving school, would have joined a company as a badminton player.\n                    Kim stated that two contemporaries of the deceased had received signing-on\n                    payments of 70m won (“KRW”) and 100m KRW, and received starting\n                    annual salaries in the range of 40m KRW (if the player was not a national\n                    player) and at least 50m KRW for a national player. On top of that, national\n                    players would receive 30,000 KRW a day for training at the National Athletes\n                    Village. He added that female national players may remain as national players\n                    till they are about 32 years old when they get married if they are winning\n                    medals consistently, but on the average female national players marry between 28\n                    and 29, and some will remain on the national team even after\n                marriage. 51     Hwang Hye Young, the badminton coach at the\n                    deceased’s school, also believed that the deceased would have been in the\n                    national team if she were alive and may be shortlisted for the 2012 Olympic\n                    Games. 52     Lee Deuk Choon, the head coach and team\n                    manager for the Korean national junior team, believed that the deceased would\n                    have been a national player at the time of the trial in 2009 if she had not\n                    died. He confirmed that national players received a daily allowance of 30,000\n                    KRW during training, and that a national player will receive a starting annual\n                    salary of at least 50m KRW. He did not say when a female player would stop being\n                    a national player, but he stated that most female players continue playing\n                    professionally until they are about 36, when most of them would become\n                    professional badminton coaches. A coach for junior players in a school would\n                    earn between 50m KRW and 60m KRW a year. 53     On the evidence, the deceased would have\n                    turned professional in 2010. She would have been a national player at that\n                    stage. She would have received a sign-on payment of 100m KRW and a starting\n                    salary of 50m KRW when she was 20 years old. On the evidence that the average\n                    national player would marry at the age of 28 or 29, and only some of them will\n                    continue with the national team after marriage, I allow eight years as the\n                    period in which the deceased would have played and earned as a national player,ie, up to the age of 28 in 2018, and that she\n                    would play professionally until she is 36 years old,ie, for another period of eight years. 54     The evidence on the earnings of 40m KRW and\n                    50m KRW did not make clear if those figures were gross figures or nett figures.\n                    A wage earner is unlikely to be able to spend the full amount he earns. There\n                    may be income tax to pay and enforced savings (eg,\n                    Central Provident Fund payments in Singapore) to make. The taxes and enforced\n                    savings will reduce his disposable income. In the absence of the relevant\n                    information, I take the disposable income of a professional player to be 40m KRW\n                    and that of a national player to be 50m KRW, and the signing-on payment to be\n                    70m KRW. The figures at the lower ends of the ranges are also used because the\n                    dependency awards are payable in a lump sum, instead of being spread out over\n                    years. There was also evidence that a player may receive additional payments for\n                    winning competitions but I find such earnings conjectural and too uncertain to\n                    be taken into consideration. 55     On this basis, the deceased would have earned\n                    a one-time payment of 70m KRW in 2010, and annual salaries of 50m KRW, a daily\n                    training allowance of 30,000 KRW a day for year-round training with one month\n                        off,[note: 19]which would\n                    amount to 9.9m KRW a year, from 2010 to 2018, and annual salaries of 40m KRW\n                    from 2019 to 2023. 56     How much of her income would the deceased have\n                    given over as family support? The first plaintiff claimed that traditionally in\n                    Korea, daughters gave 70% to 80% of their salary to their parents, but nothing\n                    was produced to support that. In the closing submissions, the plaintiffs claimed\n                    “at least 50%”.[note: 20]The deceased’s friends were questioned on\n                    the issue. Bang said she would like to give her parents 40% of her\n                        income[note: 21]whereas Yoo said that\n                    she would spend 400,000 KRW a month and she would save the rest of the money,\n                    which is sent to her mother.[note: 22]It was unclear whether she meant that\n                    the money was to be treated as her savings or her family contributions. Against\n                    the background of the evidence, I find that the deceased would have contributed\n                    40% of her projected earnings to her family.",
        "The dependency claims": "57     There are three claims from the\n                    deceased’s father, mother and brother. Each one has to be assessed on its\n                    own.",
        "The brother’s claim": "58     His entitlement was for 5 years, from 2010 to\n                    2015. During that period the deceased’s earnings were the signing-on\n                    payment of 70m KRW, 5 years’ salary at 50m KRW per annum amounting to 250m\n                    KRW, 5 years’ training allowance of 9.9m KRW per annum, or 49.5m KRW. That\n                    makes a total of 369.5m KRW. The deceased would have contributed 40% of that, or\n                    147.8m KRW to her dependents, and the brother is entitled to 20% of that,ie29.56m KRW.",
        "The father’s claim": "59     This is for the period 2010 to 2022. The\n                    deceased’s projected earnings between 2010 and 2015 is 369.5m KRW. For the\n                    three years from 2016 to 2018 she would have received three years’ further\n                    salaries as a national player as well as three years’ training allowances.\n                    That would be 150m KRW in salaries and 29.7m KRW in training allowances, making\n                    a total of 179.7m KRW. After 2018, she would have ceased to be a national\n                    player, and she would have earned an annual salary of 40m KRW with no training\n                    allowances. For the four years from 2019 to 2022, she would have earned another\n                    160m KRW. Her total income for 2010 to 2022 would be 709.2m KRW. The deceased\n                    would have contributed 40% of that, or 283.68m KRW to her dependents. The\n                    father’s entitlement of 40% of that is 113.472m KRW.",
        "The mother’s claim": "60     Her claim is for the period 2010 to 2023. The\n                    deceased’s projected earnings would have increased by 40m KRW over the\n                    previous year to 749.2m KRW. The deceased would have contributed 40% of that, or\n                    299.68m KRW to her dependents. The mother’s share at 40% is 119.872m\n                    KRW. 61     The total dependency entitlement of the three\n                    persons is 262.904m KRW. To put that in Singapore currency at today’s\n                    exchange rate of 1 KRW = $0.00123282, it is $324,113.30, and the amount\n                    recoverable on the 30% apportionment is $97,233.99.",
        "Pain and suffering": "62     The plaintiffs made a claim for pain and\n                    suffering in respect of the injuries which the deceased suffered, including a\n                    contused brain, skull fractures, pelvic and sacral fractures, fracture of the\n                    left pneumothorax and fractures of the upper limb. They acknowledged that she\n                    only survived the accident for slightly more than five hours, and submitted that\n                    an award of $2,500 should be made. 63     While the $2,500 quantification was low for\n                    such serious injuries, there was no evidence that the deceased suffered any pain\n                    as a result of the injuries. Bang, who was with her at the scene of accident\n                    testified that the deceased was unconscious and unresponsive. The deceased\n                    arrived in hospital in a state of coma and she did not respond to resuscitation\n                    efforts. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs had not proved that the deceased\n                    experienced any pain and suffering, and the claim must fail – seeLow Yok Ying & Another v Sim Kok Lee &\n                        Others[1990] 2 SLR(R) 713.",
        "Special damages": "64     The plaintiffs’ claim for special\n                    damages in the Statement of Claim was made up of six items[note: 23]but in\n                    the closing submissions, there were seven items claimed[note: 24]which were grouped under four headings,\n                    namely, bereavement, expenses paid by the Korean Badminton Association\n                    (“KBA”), costs relating to the Coroner’s Inquiry and\n                    expenses incurred in August 2007 and August 2008.[note: 25] 65     I shall deal with these claims in the same\n                    way. The first claim for bereavement was made under s 21 of the Civil Law\n                    Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) which set damages for bereavement at $10,000\n                    (increased to $15,000 for deaths occurring from 1 March 2009). Pursuant to\n                    the apportionment of liability, the plaintiffs are awarded 30% of that, or\n                    $3,000. 66     The second claim was for expenses incurred for\n                    the plaintiffs’ trip to Singapore immediately following the accident, the\n                    deceased’s funeral expenses and the expenses for another trip by the first\n                    plaintiff and a representative of the KBA to Singapore to consult lawyers. These\n                    expenses were paid by the KBA. The plaintiffs’ solicitors submitted that\n                    the KBA paid the expenses on the understanding that the plaintiffs will\n                    reimburse the KBA after they recover them from the defendant.[note: 26]However, that was not the evidence. All that\n                    was stated by the first plaintiff was that he and his wife intended to reimburse\n                    the KBA these expenses. There was no mention of undertaking or understanding,\n                    only their intention. The KBA had given financial assistance unconditionally to\n                    the plaintiffs in their time of need. These were not expenses which the\n                    plaintiffs have to repay to the KBA, and are not recoverable as special\n                    damages. 67     The third claim was for the plaintiffs’\n                    solicitors’ bill for costs and disbursements for attending the\n                    Coroner’s Inquiry on the deceased’s death in March 2007 in the sum\n                    of $5,350. The defendant did not dispute that such costs are recoverable, but\n                    disagreed on the amount to be paid. Instead of stating and producing evidence on\n                    the normal range of costs charged for attending Coroner’s Inquiries,\n                    counsel for the defendant referred to the costs payable for applications for\n                    summary judgments set out in O 59 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5,\n                    2006 Rev Ed) (which are between $2,000 and $15,000) and for claims for up\n                    to $20,000 in the Magistrates’ Courts, where the costs are set between\n                    $3,000 to $6,000. The defendant could also have asked that the costs be taxed,\n                    but instead of doing that, her counsel argued that the costs should be $1,000.\n                    Those scaled costs are not relevant to the issue in question. The amount billed\n                    did not appear to be manifestly unreasonable, and in the absence of evidence\n                    that they were excessive, I allow the amount claimed. 68     The fourth head of claim was for two trips the\n                    first plaintiff made to Singapore, in August 2007 and in August 2008. The first\n                    was to have a meeting with the Korean Embassy to seek assistance to find out\n                    from the Attorney-General’s Chambers why the defendant had not been\n                    charged, and the second trip was to consult his lawyers and finalise the filing\n                    of the action. While the first plaintiff produced documents on the expenses\n                    incurred, he did not say that he had incurred the expenses and counsel also did\n                    not state in the closing submissions that these expenses were borne by him. In\n                    fact the receipt for the air tickets and hotel charges for the second trip was\n                    issued to the KBA. It is axiomatic that the plaintiffs cannot recover as special\n                    damages expenses incurred but not paid by them which they do not have to repay.\n                    These expenses may have been borne by the KBA as further financial support to\n                    the plaintiffs following the accident. I find that the plaintiffs have not\n                    proved these claims.",
        "Interest": "69     The plaintiffs have claimed interest on the\n                    damages. Each head of damages have to be considered separately on this\n                    issue. 70     For the dependency claims, the deceased would\n                    not have made any contributions to her parents and brother until 2010, when she\n                    would have left school and turned professional. For this reason, when they\n                    receive the damages they have not been kept out of their money. Therefore no\n                    interest is payable on these awards. 71     The bereavement damages of $3,000 accrued on\n                    the death of the deceased, so interest will be paid on this amount from\n                    13 December 2005. Similarly, counsel’s legal costs for the attendance\n                    at the Coroner’s Inquiry are payable on the date of the bill,ie9 September 2009, and interest shall be payable\n                    from that date. The interest will be paid at the rate of 5.33% per\n                annum. 72     I will hear parties on the costs of the\n                    present proceedings.
