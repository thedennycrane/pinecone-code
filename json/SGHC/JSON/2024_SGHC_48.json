        "Background facts": "3 I begin with the background facts. The respondent was placed into judicial management on 2 February 2023. The applicant was appointed as its judicial manager. Pursuant to the judicial management order (viz, HC/ORC 5429/2023), the respondent’s period of judicial management would have expired on 29 January 2024. 4 On 6 November 2023, the applicant presented a statement of proposals to the respondent’s known creditors. Among these creditors was PT Bank Negara Indonesia (Persero) TBK, Singapore Branch (“BNI”), which held 62.3% of the total debt owed by the respondent. A creditors’ meeting was also due to be convened on 13 December 2023 for creditors to give feedback on the statement of proposals. 5 Subsequently, on 23 November 2023, BNI emailed the applicant to say that it wished to address certain concerns and propose changes to the statement of proposals. Among other things, BNI wanted clarification on the interest rate to be applied on the respondent’s loans during the period of repayment. BNI also proposed modifications to the statement of proposals to provide greater clarity and transparency on the proposed repayment schedule. In light of these points, BNI sought an adjournment of the scheduled creditors’ meeting so that creditors would have more time to give their feedback on the statement of proposals. 6 The applicant considered BNI’s concerns to be helpful for improving the statement of proposals. He also saw merit in BNI’s proposal to adjourn the scheduled creditors’ meeting. As such, on 4 December 2023, the applicant wrote to the respondent’s creditors to inform them of BNI’s request to adjourn the scheduled creditors’ meeting. In the same letter, the applicant also pointed out that it would be necessary to seek an extension of the respondent’s period of judicial management in light of this adjournment. Further, on 14 December 2023, the applicant wrote to the respondent’s creditors to set out the indicative timelines for the key milestones of the respondent’s judicial management. Among other things, the indicative timelines provided for the applicant to circulate a revised statement of proposals on 16 February 2024 and for the consequent creditors’ meeting to be held on 8 March 2024. 7 As of the date of the hearing, no creditor had objected to the adjournment of the creditors’ meeting or the indicative timelines.",
        "Whether the judicial management order should be extended": "",
        "The applicable principles": "21 I turn now to whether the time for the applicant to put forward the statement of proposals should be extended. 22 The applicable legal principles can be stated briefly. As the High Court stated inPTBank Negara Indonesia (Persero) TBK, Singapore Branch v Farooq Ahmad Mann (in his capacity as judicial manager) and another and other matters[2023] SGHC 249, s 107 of the IRDA sets out the requirement for a judicial manager to put forward his statement of proposals within 90 days after the company’s entry into judicial management. More specifically, s 107(3)(a) provides that “a judicial manager may obtain an extension of the period specified in subsection (1) or (2) — (a) by making an application at any time to the Court”. This extension should be allowed where there is good reason. For instance, in the English High Court decision ofReBulb Energy Ltd[2023] 2 BCLC 666, the court (at [47]) raised the example of “when an administrator can point to events in complex inter-company and international seismic insolvencies to argue that he had good reason not to file the statement of proposals within the eight-week period”. As such, a judicial manager may raise the inability to achieve the purpose of judicial management as a good reason for seeking an extension of time.",
        "My decision: it was appropriate to extend the judicial management order in this case": "15 With the applicable principles in mind, I found that it was appropriate to extend the judicial management order in this case. 16 First, the judicial management had not yet been completed because creditors needed more time to consider and give feedback on the statement of proposals. Furthermore, BNI (the respondent’s largest creditor by far) had raised several concerns regarding the statement of proposals, and these needed to be addressed to ensure BNI’s support. 17 Second, no other alternative insolvency regime was more suitable at the time of my decision. Indeed, it would have been premature to wind up the respondent at this juncture, given that there was still a chance of preserving it as a going concern. 18 Third, I was satisfied that there was a likelihood that the extension would achieve, or at least contribute to achieving, the survival of the respondent as a going concern. Indeed, this application had been brought to give effect to BNI’s request for creditors to be given more time to consider and give feedback on the statement of proposals. Given that BNI had raised concerns, and proposed modifications to address those concerns, it was clear that BNI would likely not have accepted the statement of proposals as it stood on the date of the application. If BNI had rejected the statement of proposals, the statement of proposals would have been rejected given BNI’s majority in the value of the respondent’s debt (62.3%). As a result, an extension would increase the likelihood that BNI would accede to any future statement of proposals. This would then likely achieve the survival of the respondent as a going concern. Further, the extension of time sought was not long. 19 Fourth, in considering the creditors’ interests, I was satisfied that an extension would not prejudice the other creditors. In fact, BNI’s request for modification and feedback not only materially improved the statement of proposals,1Foot Note 1×Applicant’s Written Submissions (“AWS”) at para 14.but also provided other creditors with more time to consider and give their feedback. Besides, it was in the creditors’ best interests to give feedback at that point, before the scheduled creditors’ meeting, so that there would be no need to expend costs and waste time on another creditors’ meeting to enable those creditors to give such feedback. As for the creditors’ views, there had not been any objection raised by any other creditor to this application. 20 For these reasons, I found that it was appropriate to extend the judicial management order in this case.",

        "My decision: it was appropriate to extend the time for the applicant to put forward the statement of proposals": "23 Turning to the present application, I was satisfied that it was appropriate to grant an extension of time for the applicant to put forward the statement of proposals. This is because BNI had requested for additional time to consider and propose revisions to the statement of proposals, which the applicant had assessed to be reasonable and sensible. Indeed, not only is BNI a majority creditor of the respondent, but it had also voiced support for the statement of proposals with its modifications and clarifications. Thus, a revised statement of proposals, taking into account feedback from BNI and possibly other creditors, would likely be approved by the creditors. This made it appropriate, in my view, to extend the time for the applicant to put forward the statement of proposals.",
        "Conclusion": "24 For all the reasons above, I allowed the applicant’s application for an extension of the judicial management order, as well as an extension of time for him to put forward the statement of proposals.
