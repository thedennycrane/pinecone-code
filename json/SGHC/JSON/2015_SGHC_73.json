        "The Prosecution’s case": "3       The\naccused was arrested on 22 April 2013 by Central Narcotics Bureau\n(“CNB”) officers as part of a drug operation.[note: 2]The accused\nwas seen driving a heavy goods vehicle bearing the registration\nplate number JLF 7845 (“the Prime Mover”). He had entered Singapore\nvia the Woodlands Checkpoint between 2.00am and 3.00am. After driving\nthe Prime Mover to the Marina Bay area, he repacked the drugs and\nthen slept until 8.30am. After he woke up, he went about his work\nduties until about 9.40am to 10.00am, when he arranged to meet the\npeople to whom he was supposed to give the drugs. The accused was\ntailed by CNB vehicles from the Marina Bay area to Ang Mo Kio, where\nthe accused alighted and crossed the road to a petrol kiosk. The\naccused was seen making a phone call before returning to the Prime\nMover. He continued to drive in the direction of Yio Chu Kang. CNB\nofficers lost sight of the Prime Mover, but it was spotted shortly\nafter in the Sungei Kadut area, at about 11.00am. 4       While\nthe Prime Mover stopped along Sungei Kadut Way, two men, who had\nbeen acting suspiciously and talking under a tree, boarded the Prime\nMover. The men stayed inside the cabin of the Prime Mover for about\n20 minutes. The Prime Mover was then driven for a short distance and\nthe two men alighted at a bus stop while the Prime Mover continued\non its way. The two men were arrested by CNB officers who moved\nin on them.[note: 3]The\naccused drove on for a short distance before stopping and alighting\nfrom his vehicle, apparently to check on the passenger door which had\nnot been properly shut when the two men alighted. CNB officers moved\nin and arrested him.[note: 4] 5       Amin\nbin Abdullah (“Amin”) was one of the two men arrested at the bus\nstop.[note: 5]He\nwas searched and found to possess one plastic bag containing some\nbrown granular substance, which was later analysed and found to contain\ndiamorphine.[note: 6]It transpired\nthat, in the Prime Mover, Amin had given the accused $4,000 in exchange\nfor that plastic bag containing the drugs.[note: 7] 6       The\naccused was led into the rear seat of a CNB vehicle, where an oral statement\nwas taken from him.[note: 8]It\nreads: Q1:What do you want to speak? Ans:English. Q2:Just before your arrest, what did\nyou do? Ans:I got call from one malay guy and\nask me to come Yishun then I said to him to come to Sungei Kadut\nas I am going back to JB. Q3:What is the purpose of meeting this\nguy at Sungei Kadut? Ans:I suppose to deliver a pack of “bolla”\nto the guy who call me earlier. Q4:So where do you meet the guy who call\nyou earlier? Ans:At Sungei Kadut Way, near no. 30\nroadside. Q5:So what happen at No 30, roadside\nof Sungei Kadut Way? Ans:I saw two malay guys standing at\nthe roadside and call my handphone that I guess must be him as I’ve\nnever seen them before. Q6:What happen next? Ans:They both walked to my lorry JLF7845\nthen they get in, I pass the “bolla” to the guy that wears spects\nalso with a Bluetooth or ear piece and he give me $4000/- and ask\nme to send to the nearest bus-stop. Q7:Can you recognise the person? (Recorder\nnote: B1 was shown the following pictures for B1 to confirm) Is\nthe person inside the picture I show you? Ans:Yes, it's him with the beard and\nhe is smelly, the shirt is black and white short pants. Q8:How about the other guy? Ans:He was smoking inside my lorry and\nI never focus him. Q9:So is there, anything illegal you\nwant to surrender from your lorry JLF7845? Ans:Yes, a few more “bolla” about 3 and\nthe half and sing dollars about six thousands plus. Q10:Is the six thousand plus dollars\nyou mentioned is all drugs money? Ans:I collected from them and suppose\nto hand over to my boss in Malaysia. Q11:Who is your boss? Ans:I’ve never seen him but I’ve got\nhis handphone number in my handphone. Q12:Are you awared that the money you\ncollected which is going to hand over to your boss were all drug\nmoney? Ans:I only know the money they pay were\nfrom the pending payment to boss. Q13:All the “bolla” that you say balance\nabout 3 and the ½ belongs to who? Ans:My boss. Q14:What do you intend to do with it? Ans:The customers will call me then I\nhand over to them. Q15:Is there anything else you wanna\nsay or change pertaining means all the answers you have given me? Ans:I am sorry, I know it’s wrong but\nI need to earn money as all my children need money for their studies. 7       The\nPrime Mover was searched in the accused’s presence by CNB officers\nwho recovered, among other things, one tied black plastic bag with three\npackets of brown granular substance (in the compartment above the driver’s\nseat) and one green plastic bag containing one packet of brown granular\nsubstance (in the centre console to the left of the driver’s seat).[note: 9]These\nexhibits were sealed, brought back to CNB, and later conveyed to\nthe Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. They were analysed\nand found to contain not less than 43.32g of diamorphine in total.[note: 10] 8       Over\nthe course of investigations, W/Insp Yang Rongluan took six statements\nunder s 22 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed)\n(“CPC”). These were recorded in English with an interpreter’s help\nand admitted into evidence without challenge as to their admissibility.[note: 11]In these\nstatements, the accused admitted that this was the fourth occasion\nhe had brought drugs into Singapore. He had brought “bola” from\nMalaysia to Singapore on three occasions in January and April 2013\nprior to his arrest.[note: 12]He understood\n“bola” to mean drugs. He obtained the supply from a person known\nto him as Jagen.[note: 13]The accused\nagreed to work for Jagen because he needed money to pay off his\nloans.[note: 14]He had delivered “half\nbola” on the first occasion and four packets each on the second\nand the third occasions.[note: 15]He received\nRM2,000 for each of the second and third deliveries.[note: 16]The\naccused also helped Jagen collect money from drug clients in Singapore\nin February and March 2013 for “about 11 times”. The money would\nbe collected by men on behalf of “drug bosses”.[note: 17]Jagen subsequently\npaid the accused between S$50 and S$150 for each successful collection\nof money.[note: 18]For this fourth trip,\nJagen and another man, known to the accused as “Dinesh”, handed\none and a half packets and three packets of drugs to the accused\nrespectively. These were to be delivered to various clients of the\n“drug bosses” in Singapore. Dinesh had told the accused that the\npackets contained chocolate but the accused did not believe him\nat any point in time.[note: 19]The accused entered Singapore\nin the early hours of 22 April 2013, parked his vehicle at his worksite,\nslept and then went about his regular work duties in the morning\nbefore arranging to deliver the drugs to the various drug clients.",
        "The defence": "9       The\naccused admitted that he was delivering “bola” or drugs on Jagen’s\nbehalf but contended that he did not know the nature of the drugs he\nwas delivering at the material time. 10     He\nsaid that he first accepted Jagen’s offer to deliver “half bola”\nto a drug client in January 2013 because he needed money to clear\nhis debts with a bank and with one Mohan, who was Jagen’s friend.\nJagen told the accused that bringing drugs into Singapore would\nfetch quick money and that the drugs would contain little drug content.\nHe would therefore face a very light sentence if caught.[note: 20]The accused\nsaid that he was initially reluctant to perform this fourth delivery\nbut Jagen told the accused that the “bosses” may do “something harmful”\nto the accused and his family if he did not. The accused eventually\nrelented and agreed to do the delivery.[note: 21] 11     The\naccused also called Amin as his witness. At the time of the trial, Amin\nwas in remand awaiting trial. The other man who was arrested, one Razali\nbin Shafiei (“Razali”), has been given a discharge not amounting\nto an acquittal and was released from custody before the present\ntrial. The accused did not wish to call Razali as a witness. According\nto Amin, a person known to him as “J Boy” gave him the accused’s\nphone number so that he could meet and pass money to the accused.\nOn 22 April 2013, Amin called the accused’s phone six times. Through\nthese calls, the accused arranged to meet Amin at Sungei Kadut Way.\nHowever, Amin denied asking the accused whether the latter had “batu”.\nAt Sungei Kadut, Amin boarded the Prime Mover with Razali and Amin\nhanded $4,000 to the accused. The accused later handed him a packet\nof drugs, to which Amin said “not mine”. Amin then received a call\nfrom “J Boy”. Amin asked “J Boy” whether he needed to “masak” (Malay for “cook”) the drugs. Amin complained\nthat “$4,000 was not worth it” but took the packet of drugs. Amin\nasked to be dropped off at a bus stop. Both Amin and Razali then alighted\nfrom the Prime Mover and were arrested by CNB officers shortly thereafter.",
        "The court’s decision": "12     In\nsubstance, the defence focused on the issues of knowledge and, to\na small extent, duress. Before I deal with each in more detail,\nI will quickly deal with a point that arose during the trial. 13     The\naccused contended that he never used the words “drug boss” in his\nstatements. Instead, he said that he had consistently referred to\nan Indian man in his s 22 statements and he had said “boss” (but\nnot “drug boss”) in his contemporaneous statement. However, the\naccused conceded that the statements were recorded accurately and\nhe had an opportunity to correct his statements.[note: 22]In any event, the issue of\nwhether it was an Indian man or a drug boss was immaterial as the\naccused knew he was delivering drugs on another’s behalf.",
        "Whether the presumption of knowledge\napplied": "14     Section 18(2)\nof the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”) provides\nthat any person who is proved or presumed to have had a controlled\ndrug in his possession shall, until the contrary is proved, be presumed\nto have known the nature of that drug. This applies to the accused\nin two ways: first, by virtue of s 18(1)(a)\nof the MDA, as he was arrested with the drugs in the plastic bags\nthat he was carrying and second, by virtue of s 21 of the MDA, as\nthe accused was in charge of the Prime Mover at the material time.\nTo rebut the presumption of knowledge in the context of s 18(2)\nof the MDA, the accused must prove on a balance of probabilities\nthat he did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have\nknown that the thing in his possession contained that controlled\ndrug (Dinesh Pillai a/l K Raja Retnam v Public\nProsecutor[2012] 2 SLR 903 at[21]). 15     The\naccused claimed that he had relied on the assurances of Jagen (who\nhe said was a close friend) that the drugs had low drug content\nand that he would face a light sentence if he was caught. Accordingly,\nhe did not know and could not reasonably be expected to have known\nthat the plastic bags he was carrying contained diamorphine. To\nthis end, the defence relied on the Court of Appeal decision inKhor Soon Lee[2011] 3 SLR 201 (“Khor Soon Lee”). There, the appellant\nappealed against his conviction on the charge of importing 27.8g\nof diamorphine into Singapore. The appellant, on the instructions\nof one Tony, had brought in various types of drugs like Ketamine\nand Ecstasy to Singapore. However, the appellant did not know the\ncontents of the fourth bundle and thought it to be “ice”. The Court\nof Appeal, in allowing the appeal, considered that: (a)     the\nappellant had consistently imported drugs which would not attract\na death sentence; (b)     he\nhad been careful to confirm with Tony that the packages contained\nonly controlled drugs and not diamorphine; (c)     he\ntrusted Tony because of a close and personal relationship; and (d)     accordingly,\nhe did not have a strong suspicion to which he turned a blind eye;\nat most, his failure to check the nature of the drugs amounted to\nnegligence or recklessness but that was not enough to establish\nwilful blindness. 16     Additionally,\nthe accused also said that he wanted to ask his good friends who\nwere customs officers what exactly the drugs were, but, unfortunately\nfor him, none of them was on duty at the checkpoint when he drove\ninto Singapore. 17     Finally,\nit was submitted that the accused did not know the nature of what\nhe was carrying, as supported by the fact that he had left the package of\ndrugs in an exposed part of the Prime Mover while it was parked\nin Johor Baru overnight[note: 23]and that he\nwas neither nervous nor behaving unusually both the night before\nhis arrest (after receiving the drugs from Jagen and Dinesh) and\nwhen passing through the customs checks. The accused also said that\nhe did not even know what heroin or diamorphine was. He said that\nwhen he asked why he was charged for importing diamorphine, two CNB\nofficers had told him “It’s heroin. You don’t know, ah?” He asked\nthe interpreter what “diamorphine” meant and the interpreter replied\nthat it was the scientific name for heroin. W/Insp Yang also testified\nthat she explained to the accused that diamorphine is a chemical\nname for the drugs that he had brought into Singapore. 18     I\nshall dispose of the last submission first. The fact that he was behaving\nnormally might show that he did not have actual knowledge of the nature\nof his drugs or that he was a cool courier of drugs. As for his\nclaim that he did not even know what “heroin” or “diamorphine” was,\nhe nevertheless said that he knew that it was wrong to bring drugs\nin and that he was sorry.[note: 24]The\nreal issue is whether the presumption of knowledge applied and whether\nit has been rebutted. This in turn depends on whether the accused\nhad a strong suspicion that he was carrying diamorphine and, if so,\nwhether he had turned a blind eye to it. This brings me back to\nthe accused’s first two submissions. 19     The\nevidence shows that the accused did or should have had a strong suspicion\nthat he was carrying diamorphine. First, based on his police statements\nand oral testimony, he was fully aware that the plastic bags contained\nillegal drugs, which he referred to as “bola”. Second, the accused had\nan untenable way of reasoning that “bola” had little drug content.\nHe knew he was carrying “bola” or “batu” (street names for illegal\ndrugs) and saw that the drugs were brown and powdery. It was different\nfrom another drug known to him as “ganja”, which he knew to be the\n“green colour leaf thing”.[note: 25]He had been told by Jagen\nthat “ganja” was “nothing” and contained “very little drug content”\nand he reasoned that “bola” contained less drug content than “ganja”\nsimply because it was not “ganja” and because it was a different\ncolour from “ganja”. In my view, the accused had no basis to reason\nthis way. Instead, it should have raised suspicions in his mind\nabout the true nature of what he was carrying. Third, the accused\nwas disproportionately rewarded for previous deliveries of “bola”.\nHe was promised a payment of RM2,500, which he conceded was a “big\nsum” and he had in fact wondered he was paid so much for delivering\nsuch small packets.[note: 26]The fact that\nJagen was known to deal in drugs and the fact that the accused was\nbeing paid so handsomely for an apparently easy task must have created\na strong suspicion that what the accused was carrying was valuable\nand highly illegal and to which he turned a blind eye. 20     The\naccused conceded in cross-examination that he knew that drug offences\nwere very serious and potentially carried the death penalty.[note: 27]Despite this, he was content\nto rely only on Jagen’s bare assurances. However, I do not see why\nthe accused should have done so. Nothing suggests a close friendship\nwith Jagen; the facts point instead to a more arm’s-length relationship.\nIn cross-examination, the accused could only say that they would\nmeet in the coffee shop on Sundays to watch football and that Jagen\nwould offer him a lift if he was going back to Seremban or Kuala Lumpur.[note: 28]However, he could not\neven say where Jagen lived. Moreover, he described his first encounter\nwith Jagen as one where Jagen had chased the accused to clear his\ndebt with Mohan on Mohan’s behalf, and where Jagen said that “Mohan\nwould spread the news and spoil [his] name if [he did] not pay up\nsoon”.[note: 29]As for Dinesh’s assurance\nthat the drugs were chocolate, the accused had already said that\nhe knew Dinesh was lying and he did not believe Dinesh.[note: 30] 21     The\naccused claimed that he could not check with his friends working at\nthe checkpoint what exactly the drugs were as none of them was on\nduty when he drove into Singapore. Since he had delivered drugs\non three previous occasions over a span of three months, he had\nample opportunity to check what the drugs were. Moreover, he did\nnot mention this anywhere in his police statements, which were otherwise\nquite detailed. This excerpt from the cross-examination of the accused\nis particularly telling: Q:Okay,\nI want to put it to you that even though you were not entirely in a\nrelationship of trust with these---with Jagen, you were content\nto rely on Jagen’s bare assurances that the drugs you were bringing\nin were not serious drugs or hardcore drugs. A:Yes. Q:I put it to you that that you knew\nthat Dinesh was not trustworthy. A:Yes. … Q:Okay,\nmy final put to you, Mr Siva, you didn’t conduct your own checks\nbecause you were willing to bring the drugs into Singapore regardless\nof what drugs they were, you just wanted to earn the 2,500 Ringgit. A:In a way.[note: 31] 22     This\ncase is not likeKhor Soon Lee,\nwhere the appellant was in a relationship of trust with the person\nwho had passed him the drugs and where he had actually satisfied\nhimself that the drugs he was handling did not involve the death\npenalty. Furthermore, the appellant had been prejudiced by the fact\nthat Tony, who would have been a significant defence witness, was\nnot available to testify. In fact, the Court of Appeal warned at [29]\nthat the facts were unusual and should not set a precedent for future cases.\nOn the present facts, a reasonable person in the accused’s shoes would\nnot only have had great suspicions about the true nature of the\ndrugs that Jagen and Dinesh had handed over but would also have\ninquired further to determine the true nature of those drugs. In\nmy view, the accused, not having done so, turned a blind eye to\nthese suspicions. Accordingly, I found that he failed to rebut the\npresumption of knowledge.",
        "Whether the defence of duress\napplied": "23     Although\nthe defence made no arguments on duress in closing submissions,\nI will mention it briefly. To establish duress under s 94 of the Penal\nCode (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed), the accused must prove on a balance\nof probabilities that the threats made to him were “imminent, persistent\nand extreme”, that such threatscouldanddidimpress upon him a reasonable apprehension\nthat “instant death” would otherwise be the consequence of his failure\nto commit the crime and that he had no reasonable opportunity to\nescape from or neutralise the threat (Public\nProsecutor v Nagaenthran a/l K Dharmalingam[2011] 2\nSLR 830 at[17]and[28]perChan Seng Onn J). 24     On\nthe facts, I saw no duress. Although the accused had, in his police statements\nand oral testimony, suggested that there was a threat to his well-being,\nhe could not state any specific threats. Instead, he could only\nsay that he “felt [that he] was being forced” as the “drug bosses”\nknew where he was staying. The accused was also in control of his\nsituation—on the day of his arrest, he drove into Singapore, slept\nin his Prime Mover, repacked the drugs, went about his daily work\nand even dictated the time at which he would pass the drugs to other\npersons. He could have, for example, escaped or contacted the police\nfor help at any time. If duress had been raised during the trial,\nI would have rejected it. 25     As\nthe accused has not rebutted the presumptions on a balance of probabilities,\nI convicted him accordingly.",
        "The sentence": "26     The\nPublic Prosecutor certified that the accused had substantively assisted\nthe CNB. I also found, on a balance of probabilities, that the accused\nwas a mere courier in that his involvement in the offence was restricted\nto transporting and delivering the drugs (s 33B(2)(a)). Having satisfied\nboth limbs of s 33B(2) of the MDA, the accused could be sentenced under\ns 33B(1)(a) of the MDA which provides\nthat the court may, instead of imposing the death penalty, sentence\nthe accused to imprisonment for life and, if the accused is sentenced\nto life imprisonment, the court shall also sentence him to caning\nof not less than 15 strokes. 27     No\nfacts were given and no submissions were made to justify the imposition\nof the ultimate punishment of the death penalty on the accused. The\naccused was born on 14 September 1968 and is now 46 years old. He therefore\ndoes not fall within s 325(1)(b)\nof the CPC which provides that men who are more than 50 years of\nage (at the time of infliction of the caning) shall not be punished\nwith caning. The only submission on sentence made by his counsel\nafter the conviction was that the minimum number of strokes should\nbe imposed as the accused was already 46 years old. Accordingly,\nI sentenced him to life imprisonment (to commence from 22 April\n2013, his date of arrest) and 15 strokes of the cane, the minimum sentence\nprovided by law. 28     On\n26 February 2015, the accused filed a notice of appeal against his sentence\nonly, on the ground that “the sentence is unreasonable and manifestly\nexcessive”. As indicated earlier, the accused was sentenced to the minimum\nimprisonment and caning provided by law and his life imprisonment\nterm was backdated to the date of his arrest. It is therefore unclear\nupon what grounds he is asserting that the sentence imposed is unreasonable\nor excessive.  [note: 1]NE, Day 5, p 22:8–14.
