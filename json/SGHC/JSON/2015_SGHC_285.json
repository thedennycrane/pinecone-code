        "The appellant’s contentions": "6       On appeal, counsel for the appellant accepted\n                    that deception is inherent in such offences, and agreed that the District Judge\n                    was not wrong to have regard to the “not inconsiderable” potential\n                    harm that might be caused should traffic or other violations occur.\n                    Nevertheless, he submitted that an aggravating feature must exist to warrant a\n                    custodial term. This might take the form of evidence of some other circumstance\n                    or particular act or acts of deception, such as a collateral purpose in using\n                    the false licence plate,eg, to evade Electronic\n                    Road Pricing (“ERP”) charges (as was the case inPublic Prosecutor v Tan Wei Jin[2010] SGDC 216\n                        (“Tan Wei Jin”)). Even then the\n                    High Court had found in dealing with the appeal inPublic\n                        Prosecutor v Chua Chee Hou[2012] SGDC 89 (“Chua Chee Hou”) (Magistrate’s Appeal\n                    No 61 of 2012) that a fine would suffice on the facts, where the appellant\n                    affixed a false licence plate on the car in question so that he could reuse a\n                    season parking ticket and avoid payment of parking charges. 7       The key plank of counsel’s submission was\n                    that there was no discernible dishonesty or deception equivalent to that\n                    demonstrated in the cases cited before the District Judge. The appellant’s\n                    motive should have been accorded due consideration in determining the\n                    appropriate sentence, given that there was no evidence of any violation of other\n                    laws. The car was rented for less than a week, and all the appellant wanted to\n                    do was to “feel rich” in the car, and “look good”\n                    posing for a photo shoot with the false licence plate number SQ1H, which was a\n                    “golden number”. There was no other sinister motive and no basis\n                    to assume that he had some other nefarious or unlawful aims in mind. It was thus\n                    submitted that the District Judge had erred in summarily dismissing his\n                    reasons.",
        "The prosecution’s submissions": "8       In response to the appellant’s submission,\n                    the Deputy Public Prosecutor (“DPP”) countered that public policy\n                    considerations would require a deterrent sentence for such offences. Sentencing\n                    precedents show that the starting point would be a custodial sentence. There was\n                    potential harm in each offence, and innocent parties might be affected and\n                    resources would need to be expended to trace the actual offender if there were\n                    to be any traffic violations involving the car. 9       The DPP submitted that the very act of fixing a\n                    false number plate by itself involved deception. In response to the\n                    court’s query, the DPP clarified that the offence in question was detected\n                    at random and there was no evidence of any traffic or other violations committed\n                    by the appellant. Nonetheless, the DPP took issue with the appellant’s\n                    stated motives and submitted that his explanations of preparing for a photo\n                    shoot and wanting to “feel rich” by driving the car with the false\n                    licence plate were not consistent and thus did not merit\n                consideration. 10     The DPP further submitted that offenders could\n                    easily come up with unsubstantiated justifications. Such offences were also very\n                    difficult to detect. She suggested that the appropriate sentence should be\n                    pegged toTan Wei Jin. In that case, the appellant\n                    chose to withdraw his appeal against a two-week jail term, and had offered an\n                    unsubstantiated motive for affixing the false licence plate, ostensibly to\n                    follow his father whom he suspected of having an affair. The District Judge inTan Wei Jinhad also agreed that there was\n                    evidence of premeditation to evade detection including for non-payment of the\n                    ERP charges. 11     As forChua Chee\n                        Hou, the DPP highlighted that he was caught evading parking\n                    charges by reusing a season parking ticket issued for another vehicle, and\n                    affixing the licence plate for that vehicle to the car in question. No grounds\n                    of judgment were issued by the High Court in allowing the appeal and\n                    substituting the jail term with a fine of $3,000. The DPP suggested that the\n                    High Court might have been influenced by the fact that the appellant was not\n                    driving on the road with the car, as the car was brought to the\n                    appellant’s workshop for long-term repairs.",
        "My decision": "",
        "The mischief targeted by the provision": "12     What is the true mischief targeted by s\n                        129(2)(d) of the Act in relation to such\n                    offending conduct involving affixing another licence plate number to a vehicle?\n                    As a starting point, there must of course be “intent to deceive”\n                    since s 129(2) states that if it can be shown to the court’s\n                    satisfaction that there was no such intent, no offence would be disclosed. The\n                    pivotal enquiry relates to the purpose for which this deception was being\n                    practised. In my view, this enquiry leads to the logical conclusion that the\n                    mischief of the provision would be to deal with cases where licence plates are\n                    fraudulently switched or attached in order to facilitate the commission of some\n                    other offence. The use of another licence plate is plainly motivated in such\n                    circumstances by the desire to avoid detection and thwart enforcement or\n                    investigation efforts. There was however no evidence whatsoever of any such\n                    motive in the present case. 13     I accept that deception is inherent in the\n                    offence, and such offences are indeed difficult to detect. I also agree entirely\n                    with the District Judge that there is “not inconsiderable”\n                    potential harm that might result. An obvious example will be if the driver is\n                    involved in some other traffic violation or a serious road accident. It may mean\n                    that innocent third parties become inconvenienced by the resulting\n                    investigations. They could be seriously prejudiced since third-party insurance\n                    claims could be frustrated, and the driver may well not even be insured.\n                    Moreover, enforcement actions, if any, can be hampered or slowed down by further\n                    checks and verification that would be required to ascertain the actual licence\n                    plate number. These are all relevant considerations. But there was once again\n                    plainly no evidence of any actual harm or inconvenience in the present case.\n                    More importantly, there was no evidence put forth of any intent to cause such\n                    potential harm or inconvenience.",
        "The relevance of motive and the prosecution’s submission on\n                sentence": "14     I turn next to the different explanations the\n                    appellant appeared to have put forward before the District Judge for his\n                    conduct. She was not impressed by his explanations, which she found to be both\n                    “puzzling” and “unsubstantiated”, although it is not\n                    clear if she had rejected both explanations outright. Nevertheless even if his\n                    motives could be said to be inconsistent (and I do not necessarily agree they\n                    are), I did not think this would by itself tip the scales towards a custodial\n                    term when his motives appear to be quite innocent. 15     There was no basis in my view to conclude that\n                    these must be unsubstantiated and henceprima\n                        facieunacceptable motives when the prosecution had adduced no\n                    evidence to contradict his explanations. They appeared to be plausible reasons\n                    for such conduct. From his explanations, he acknowledged that he was an\n                    attention-seeking young man, whose age belies his immaturity and fatuousness. He\n                    was simply intent on showing off, driven by the desire to “feel\n                    rich” behind the wheel of a flashy rented sports car. He wanted to be\n                    seen in (or with) the car with a “golden number” rather than the\n                    uninspiring “plain vanilla” number that came with the car itself.\n                    That is not palpably inconsistent with the explanation he first gave to the\n                    District Judge that he rented the car to pose with it at a photo shoot that he\n                    was helping his friend with. They may be separate and even unrelated reasons.\n                    Some may even form the view that they are frivolous reasons, but they were not\n                    necessarily inconsistent or inherently incredible explanations. 16     With respect, the District Judge may have\n                    placed undue reliance on his differing reasons, almost as if his inability to\n                    keep to a consistent explanation had aggravated the offence. In any event, his\n                    explanations themselves were clearly not aggravating factors, despite a\n                    thinly-veiled attempt by the Prosecuting Officer to suggest this in the written\n                    submission tendered before the District Judge seeking a custodial sentence. At\n                    paragraph five of the prosecution’s submission on sentence marked as\n                    ‘P1’, it was contended that “[s]uch circumstances are further\n                    aggravated by the fact that the defendant, for such triviality as to\n                    “look good” for his photoshoot, by replacing the number plates\n                    with the forged ones, also avoidance [sic] in a\n                    form of receiving the parking summons, ERP detection or other road related\n                    offences”. I did not see the relevance of the perceived\n                    “triviality” of his stated reason – it may have been trivial\n                    or frivolous, but this was by itself no reason to suggest it was therefore\n                    patently and objectively unbelievable and had somehow made his offence more\n                    aggravated. As for the possible avoidance of detection, I reiterate that there\n                    was no evidence of any such motives in the present case. 17     It was also inappropriate for the prosecution\n                    to maintain that matters were “compounded” and enforcement\n                    officers would be further “inconvenienced”. With respect, this\n                    appears to overstate the position. These considerations had no application at\n                    all to the facts in the present case. There was certainly no evidence of such\n                    inconvenience in terms of detection in the present case. He was not caught for\n                    some other offence for which he was attempting to avoid detection; the facts\n                    show that the offence was detected at random when he was stopped by a LTA\n                    officer.",
        "Calibration of the sentence": "18Chua Chee Houillustrates why the mischief targeted by the provision should be carefully\n                    examined to determine whether the factual scenario at hand falls squarely within\n                    it. Although there were no written grounds of judgment issued, it would appear\n                    that the offender’s primary motive was to “reuse” the season\n                    parking label which was issued for use on another car. He could perhaps still\n                    have driven the car in question although it was undergoing repairs. At any rate\n                    there was no evidence that the car would not or could not be driven. But\n                    nonetheless the High Court’s decision to set aside the imprisonment term\n                    and substitute it with a fine would demonstrate that even with a motive to avoid\n                    incurring additional season parking charges for the car, his culpability fell\n                    within the lower end of the spectrum. A high fine would thus be an adequate\n                    deterrent punishment. 19     In the present case, the offence was planned\n                    and premeditated. But it seems to me that every such offence of this nature\n                    would necessarily be so. As such, this is not an additional aggravating feature.\n                    It is implicit in the offence itself – I cannot see how someone could have\n                    chosen to affix a false number plate without conscious planning and\n                    deliberation. There was no evidence that the appellant had planned for long-term\n                    use of the number plate. After all, it was a rented car which he would use for\n                    less than a week. 20     More critically, there was no evidence of any\n                    other unlawful intent,eg, avoidance of parking\n                    summons or parking charges, ERP or road-related offences. There was no other\n                    violation. There was, for instance, no evidence that he did not insert a\n                    cashcard into his in-vehicle unit or that he did not display parking coupons or\n                    that he did not provide the actual car number after being involved in a car\n                    accident. There was no evidence that he was not insured. I reiterate that he was\n                    simply stopped at random by an LTA enforcement officer. It would therefore not\n                    be appropriate to overstate the potential harm that might be occasioned in such\n                    circumstances, although I would readily accept that this is a relevant\n                    consideration even if it is necessarily also a somewhat speculative\n                one. 21     It was of course entirely possible that in\n                    actual fact the appellant may have had various other reasons for affixing the\n                    licence plate number SQ1H onto the car. He was by his own admission a young man\n                    seeking to show off driving a rented sports car. It would not be implausible\n                    that he might have wanted to avoid detection should he be caught speeding or\n                    spotted driving recklessly or participating in an illegal road race. But to\n                    ascribe such a motive to him would be wholly speculative and unfair to him when\n                    no such evidence was before the court. 22     It would in fact be very likely that, in other\n                    cases, false number plates are affixed in order to facilitate the commission of\n                    other offences. I would emphasise that a custodial term is still warranted in\n                    such cases. Imprisonment of two weeks upwards should be expected even if they\n                    may be relatively minor offences such as evasion of ERP, and I would venture to\n                    suggest that a longer term in the range of four weeks would be appropriate where\n                    there is non-payment of road tax and/or insurance. There will also be aggravated\n                    offences for which more substantial sentences of imprisonment would be\n                    warranted, such as where false number plates are used on stolen cars or to\n                    facilitate the commission of more serious offences like drug trafficking,\n                    robbery, immigration or customs offences, to name just a few. In such cases, the\n                    intent to evade detection is manifestly clear and the starting point for the\n                    sentencing court would be to consider a sentence of three months’\n                    imprisonment upwards. 23     I make one final brief observation: the\n                    prosecution included among its sentencing authorities a newspaper article from\n                    August 2010 reporting the case ofTan Wei Jin.\n                    Newspaper reports are widely referred to by the general public as sources of\n                    news and information but they are hearsay and generally not reliable sources for\n                    the court to rely on.",
        "Conclusion": "24     I was of the view that a custodial sentence\n                    would not be warranted given the circumstances under which the offence was\n                    committed. In line with the High Court’s decision inChua Chee Hou, the maximum fine would be adequate punishment on\n                    the facts of this case. In my opinion, while a custodial sentence would\n                    ordinarily still be warranted, the factual circumstances in both cases were not\n                    such that they plainly fell within the mischief envisaged by the relevant\n                    provision of the Act. I therefore allowed the appeal and substituted the\n                    imprisonment term of two weeks with a fine of $5,000, in default two\n                    weeks’ imprisonment."
