        "The facts": "2 The petitioner was originally charged with three counts of outrage of\n\nmodesty under s 354 of the Penal Code (Cap 224). The prosecution proceeded only on the\n\nthird charge after the accused had indicated that he would plead guilty to the charge. The\n\nremaining two charges were taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing with the\n\nconsent of the accused.3 The petitioner pleaded guilty to the following charge:You,Name: Balasubramaniam Palaniappa Vaiyapuri, M/57 years oldDate of Birth: 26.4.1944Nationality: Indian NationalPassport No: A1504579are charged that you on the 1stday of November 2001, at or\n\n  about 5.10 pm (Singapore Time) whilst on board Singapore Airline flight SQ 973 travelling\n\n  from Bangkok, Thailand to Singapore did use criminal force to one Puspitaningrum\n\n  Retnoharsiwi, F/24 years old, to wit, by touching her right breast with your right hand,\n\n  knowing it to be likely that you will thereby outrage the modesty of the said\n\n  Puspitaningrum Retnoharsiwi, and you have thereby committed an offence punishable under\n\n  Section 354 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.4 The first charge that was taken into consideration in sentencing\n\nstated that the petitioner had on the same day, whilst on board the same flight travelling\n\nfrom Osaka, Japan to Bangkok between 1 pm and 2 pm, outraged the modesty of Ms\n\nPuspitaningrum Retnoharsiwi by touching her breast with his right hand. The other charge\n\ninvolved the petitioner outraging the modesty of the same victim by stroking her left\n\ncheek with his right hand between 1 pm to 2 pm on the same flight.5 The plea of guilt was made to a statement of facts, which the\n\npetitioner admitted to without qualification. In summary, it stated that on 1 November\n\n2001, the petitioner had asked the victim, who was a flight stewardess with Singapore\n\nAirlines, for a glass of Cognac. He then suddenly touched the victim’s right breast\n\nwith his right hand. The victim reported the matter to her colleagues and subsequently to\n\nthe Singapore Airline Control Centre at Singapore Changi Airport, Terminal 2. After\n\ndisembarking from the aircraft, the victim identified the petitioner to a police officer\n\nof the Singapore Airport Terminal Services (SATS). The petitioner was arrested and\n\nescorted to Bedok Police Division.6 The petitioner was convicted in the court below. In mitigation he\n\npleaded that he had seven daughters who were dependent on his income and urged the court\n\nto consider his case sympathetically. He also stated that he had a lot to drink on the\n\nflight.7 The district judge sentenced the petitioner to 12 months’\n\nimprisonment. No caning was imposed as the petitioner was 57 years old at the time of the\n\noffence. The judge noted that the tariff sentence in outrage of modesty cases was nine\n\nmonths’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. The judge discerned two\n\nmitigating factors in the present case: the petitioner’s plea of guilt and the fact\n\nthat he was a first offender. However, the judge was of the view that the petitioner had\n\nbrazenly touched the victim’s breast at two separate points in time and that his\n\npersistence in outraging the modesty of the victim had outweighed any mitigating value in\n\nhis plea of guilt. This warranted a sentence above the nine-month tariff.",
        "The petition for criminal revision": "8 Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the court below did not\n\nhave jurisdiction to hear the matter because no valid consent had been obtained from the\n\nAttorney-General for the commencement of proceedings. It was also argued that the plea of\n\nguilt was not unqualified and that the statement of facts was defective as it did not\n\nstate all the essential elements of the offence. Counsel submitted that the conviction and\n\nsentence had thus been rendered unsafe and sought to invoke the revisionary jurisdiction\n\nof this court to quash the conviction and to set aside the sentence imposed on the\n\npetitioner.",
        "Principles of revision": "9 The revisionary powers of the High Court are conferred by s 23 of the\n\nSupreme Court of Judicature Act and s 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code (the\n\n‘CPC’). Such powers of revision must be exercised sparingly. There must have\n\nbeen someserious injustice before the court will intervene on revision. No precise\n\ndefinition of what will constitute such serious injustice is possible as the discretion of\n\nthe courts has to be preserved. However, it must generally be shown that there was\n\nsomething palpably wrong in the decision of the court below, which struck at its basis as\n\nan exercise of judicial power: seeAng Poh Chuan v PP[1996] 1 SLR 326,Ngian\n\nChin Boon v PP[1999] 1 SLR 119,PP v Mohamed Noor bin Abdul Majeed[2000] 3 SLR 17.",
        "Lack of jurisdiction to hear the charge": "10 Section 3(2) of the Tokyo Convention Act (Cap 327) reads as follows:No proceedings for any offence under the law in force in Singapore\n\n  committed on board an aircraft while in flight elsewhere than in or over Singapore other\n\n  than an offence under the Air Navigation Act or any subsidiary legislation made thereunder\n\n  shall be instituted in Singapore except by or with the consent of the Attorney-General.11 Counsel for the petitioner contended that the court below had no\n\njurisdiction to adjudicate the matter. Counsel submitted that under s 3(2) of the Tokyo\n\nConvention Act, the consent of the Attorney-General is required if the Attorney-General is\n\nnot personally conducting the prosecution and in this case the consent of the Solicitor\n\nGeneral in his capacity as Acting Attorney-General had been obtained. The Solicitor\n\nGeneral had no powers to issue the consent for the institution of proceedings, as under s\n\n336(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code the Solicitor General is only vested with the powers\n\nof a Deputy Public Prosecutor.12 I was of the view that there was no merit in counsel’s\n\nargument. In the present case, the Solicitor-General had been officially appointed to act\n\nas the Attorney-General from 1 November 2001 to 4 November 2001 and from 11 November 2001\n\nto 14 November 2001. This was published in the Government Gazette Notification No 3076 on\n\n2 November 2001. The Solicitor General could therefore consent to the prosecution of the\n\noffence on 2 November 2001 in his capacity as the Attorney-General.13 Counsel also argued that the court lacked jurisdiction to hear the\n\ncase, given that the consent was on the face of it irregular or invalid. Counsel submitted\n\nthat this was because the charge to which consent had been given by the Acting\n\nAttorney-General stated the mens rea as one of \"intention\", whereas the charge\n\nread out to the petitioner in the court below was concerned with the mens rea of\n\n\"knowledge\" and not \"intention\".14 Counsel for the petitioner relied on several cases for support. One\n\nof the cases cited wasR v MorarkaAIR (1948) P.C. 82, which was an appeal to the\n\nPrivy Council from the High Court of Bombay. This case concerned clause 23 of the Cotton\n\nCloth and Yarn (Control) Order 1943, which required the sanction of the Provincial\n\nGovernment for the institution of proceedings against persons who contravened any of the\n\nprovisions of the Order. The court inMorarkaheld that facts constituting the\n\noffence charged in respect of which sanction was given should either be referred to on the\n\nface of the sanction or it must be proved by extraneous evidence that they were placed\n\nbefore the sanctioning authority. Where the facts were not referred to on the face of the\n\nsanction nor was it proved that they were before the authority, the sanction would be\n\ninvalid and the court would lack jurisdiction to hear the case.15 In my view,Morarkadid not lend any support to the\n\npetitioner’s contention, as a very different issue was involved in that case.Morarkawas concerned with the requisite form and contents of the sanction under Clause 23 of the\n\nOrder whereas the issue in this case was whether there was valid consent where the mens\n\nrea stated in the charges to which consent had been given was different from those that\n\nthe petitioner subsequently faced in court.16 The other cases cited by counsel for the petitioner also gave no\n\nsupport to his argument and can be distinguished from the present case. In those cases,\n\nthe offence to which consent had originally been given constituted a separate and distinct\n\noffence from the one that the accused was subsequently charged with in court.17 InPP v Lee Chwee Kiok[1979] 1 MLJ 45, the accused was\n\noriginally charged with trafficking in dangerous drugs under s 39B(1)(a) of the Dangerous\n\nDrugs Ordinance and the Public Prosecutor’s consent to prosecute had been given. At\n\nthe trial the prosecution amended the charge to one of doing an act preparatory to\n\ntrafficking under s 39B(1)(c) of the Ordinance. The court held that this was a distinct\n\noffence to which the Public Prosecutor’s consent had to be obtained and that the\n\ntrial was a nullity as consent had not been given to the amended charge.18 The accused inPP v Wong Cheong Yoon[1992] 1 CLAS\n\nNews 37 was originally charged with an offence under s 5(a)(i) of the Prevention of\n\nCorruption Act and the consent of the Public Prosecutor had been obtained under s 31 of\n\nthe Act. At the trial, the prosecution amended the charges such that they alleged offences\n\nunder s 6(a) of the Act. The court held that the amended charges concerned distinct\n\noffences under a different section of the Act and as the Public Prosecutor’s consent\n\nhad not been obtained, the court did not have the jurisdiction to hear the case.19 The above cases had clearly laid down the proposition that the court\n\nhad no jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter if the charge to which consent had been given\n\nalleged an entirely distinct offence from the one that the accused subsequently faced in\n\ncourt. The Public Prosecutor could not be said to have given his consent if he had applied\n\nhis mind to an offence which was totally different from the one that the accused was later\n\ncharged with. In the present case, however, the charge to which the Acting\n\nAttorney-General had originally given his consent did not concern an offence that was\n\nentirely different or distinct from the one that the petitioner was charged with in court.\n\nIt was still the same offence of outrage of modesty under the same section of the Penal\n\nCode, save for the alleged mens rea. In my opinion, as the Acting Attorney-General had\n\nalready applied his mind to the offence for which the petitioner was being prosecuted and\n\nhad consented to the commencement of proceedings against the petitioner, the court did\n\nhave jurisdiction to hear the case.",
        "The plea of guilt": "20 Counsel for the petitioner submitted that the plea of guilt was not\n\nunreserved, unqualified and unequivocal since the petitioner had informed the court during\n\nmitigation that he had a lot to drink before the alleged incident. It was also alleged\n\nthat the petitioner was in a daze when the charges were read out to him in court.21 Before an accused’s plea of guilty is accepted, the trial judge\n\nmust ensure that the plea is valid and unequivocal. A plea must be unequivocal in the\n\nsense that it must signify without doubt and qualification the admission by the accused to\n\nall the ingredients of the offence and all the averments of the charge:Rajeevan\n\nEdakalavan v PP[1998] 1 SLR 815.22 The test in determining the validity of the plea of guilt had been\n\ndefinitively laid down inGanesun s/o Kannan v PP[1996] 3 SLR 560andRajeevan\n\nEdakalavan(supra). It was held that the following safeguards must be observed before\n\nthe plea would be deemed valid and unequivocal. First, the court must ensure that it is\n\nthe accused himself who wishes to plead guilty. The accused should plead guilty by his own\n\nmouth and not through his counsel. Secondly, the court must ascertain whether the accused\n\nunderstands the nature and consequences of his plea. Thirdly, the court must establish\n\nthat the accused intends to admit without qualification the offence alleged against him.23 In my view, there was a valid and unequivocal plea of guilt by the\n\npetitioner in the present case. In the court below, the third charge was read and\n\nexplained to the petitioner in Tamil and the petitioner pleaded guilty. The notes of\n\nevidence clearly showed that the petitioner understood the nature and consequences of the\n\nplea. The prosecution then tendered the statement of facts, which was read to the\n\npetitioner and admitted by him without qualification. The petitioner was found guilty and\n\nconvicted. The petitioner claimed that he was \"in a daze\" when the charges were\n\nread out to him. However, he also claimed that he was \"clear\" that the statement\n\nof facts read out to him merely stated that he had \"suddenly touched the\n\nvictim’s right breast with his right hand\" without mentioning that he had done\n\nso with a guilty intention or knowledge. I could not accept the petitioner’s\n\nallegation of him being \"in a daze\" at the material time. No evidence was\n\nadduced to substantiate this allegation. I found it difficult to believe that he was in a\n\ndaze when the charges were read out to him, since he was clear as to what was stated in\n\nthe statement of facts, which was read out only shortly after the charges were read to\n\nhim. To believe that the petitioner was in a daze would be to accept that his mind became\n\nclear within a very short span of time.24 Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that, when the nature\n\nand consequences of the plea were explained to the petitioner, he was not informed that by\n\npleading guilty he was waiving his right to compound the offence under s 199(1) of the\n\nCPC. Counsel argued that \"nature and consequences\" as contained in s 180(b) of\n\nthe CPC connoted the following: (i) the nature of the charge; (ii) the punishment\n\nprescribed; (iii) the rights to which he forgoes or waives. Counsel cited the American\n\ncase ofBoykin v Alabama395 USA 238 for support.25 In my opinion, there was no merit in this submission. Section 180(b)\n\nof the CPC provides that, before a plea of guilty is recorded, the court must ascertain\n\nthat the accused understands the nature and consequences of his plea and intends to admit\n\nwithout qualification the offence alleged against him. By \"nature\" of the plea,\n\nthis meant that the accused must know exactly what he was being charged with. As for the\n\n\"consequences\" of the plea, the accused had to be aware of the punishment\n\nprescribed by the law so that he knew the possible sentence that he would receive upon\n\nconviction. There was no necessity to inform the petitioner of the possibility of the\n\noffence being compounded.26 The case ofBoykin v Alabamadid not provide support to the\n\npetitioner’s contention. It merely reaffirmed the principle that the court had to\n\nensure that an accused who pleaded guilty had a full understanding of what the plea\n\nconnoted and of its consequence. The majority of the Alabama Supreme Court held that, as\n\nthere was no affirmative evidence on the record that the petitioner had entered his plea\n\nof guilt voluntarily, there was an error on which the decision should be reversed.27 Counsel for the petitioner contended that the petitioner, by stating\n\nthat he \"had a lot to drink\" in his mitigation plea, had qualified his plea of\n\nguilt. Counsel also submitted that the words \"I had a lot to drink\" went to show\n\nthat the petitioner was so intoxicated that he did not have or was not capable of forming\n\nthe requisite intention or knowledge at the time the offence was committed and that the\n\ndefence under s 86(2) of the Penal Code was available to the petitioner. Section 86(2)\n\nreads as follows:Intoxication shall be taken into account for the purpose of determining\n\n  whether the person charged had formed any intention, specific or otherwise, in the absence\n\n  of which he would not be guilty of the offence.28 Counsel for the petitioner relied onDeonny ak Ugoh v PP[1999] 1 MLJ 469, which was a decision of the Malaysian High Court. In that case, the\n\nappellants had pleaded guilty to the charges but had claimed in the probation\n\nofficer’s reports that they were under the influence of alcohol at the time the\n\noffence was committed. The lower court had adjourned the case before sentence was passed\n\nto enable probation reports to be prepared in respect of the appellants. The High Court\n\nheld that, since there were allegations of drunkenness in the probation reports, it was\n\nthe duty of the lower court to take those allegations into account in deciding whether the\n\npleas of guilty were qualified or not. The court was of the view that the appellants’\n\npleas of guilty ought to have been rejected by the lower court as they were not\n\nunequivocal and quashed the conviction and sentence.29 In my view, this case did not assist the petitioner at all. The law\n\nin Singapore is that, if the mitigation plea qualified the earlier plea of guilt by\n\nindicating the lack of mens rea or actus reus, the accused would not be deemed to have\n\nadmitted to the offence without qualification and the plea would be rejected by the court:Ulaganathan Thamilarasan v PP[1996] 2 SLR 534. In the present case, what the\n\npetitioner said in his mitigation plea was not sufficient to constitute a qualification or\n\nmodification of the plea of guilt. It did not necessarily follow from the allegation that\n\nhe \"had a lot to drink\" that there was an absence of mens rea for the offence.\n\nAlthough the petitioner claimed that he had consumed a lot of alcohol, no evidence had\n\nbeen adduced to show that he was so intoxicated that he could not form or possess the\n\nnecessary mens rea.30 As for the defence under s 86(2) of the Penal Code, it is settled\n\nlaw that, for the defence to be available, the accused has to prove on a balance of\n\nprobabilities that by reason of his consumption of alcohol he was so intoxicated that he\n\nwas incapable of forming any intention for the offence:Suradet v PP[1993] 3 SLR 265,Juma’at bin Samad v PP[1993] 3 SLR 338,Indra Wijaya Ibrahim v PP[1995] 2 SLR 442. In the present case, the petitioner had not adduced any evidence at all\n\nas to the quantity of alcohol consumed or as to the effect of the alcohol on his state of\n\nmind.31 In any event, the offence in this case involved the mens rea of\n\n\"knowledge\" and not intention and the defence in s 86(2) was not available to\n\nthe petitioner, as the defence applied only where the mens rea for an offence was\n\nintention and not other forms of mens rea:Juma’at bin Samad(supra). I had\n\nmade the following observation in that case:It is to be noted that an anomalous consequence of the drafting of s\n\n  86(2) is that it applies only where the mens rea for an offence is intention, in\n\n  contradistinction to offences requiring other forms of mens rea specified in the Penal\n\n  Code, for example, knowledge or rashness. The result is somewhat disturbing; for example,\n\n  s 86(2) would apply to a charge of murder under s 300(a), (b) or (c) but not to a charge\n\n  of murder under s 300(d). However, the words of the provision are clear and the\n\n  consequences though discomfiting are not of such degree of absurdity as would justify the\n\n  court departing from a literal interpretation.32 Counsel for the petitioner further alleged that the petitioner had\n\ninformed the police officer, when his long statement was recorded, that he was so drunk\n\nthat he did not have the guilty intention when the incident occurred. The petitioner was\n\nthen told that such a defence was useless and that it was not necessary to bring him for a\n\nmedical examination since he was sober at that time. Due to this misapprehension, the\n\npetitioner did not mention the fact that he was intoxicated when the cautioned statement\n\nwas recorded.33 In my opinion, these allegations should not be accepted, as they\n\nwere not supported by any evidence. These assertions were untested and had not been\n\ndisclosed in the record. Although the petitioner claimed that he was drunk, there was no\n\nevidence to substantiate this claim other than the bare assertion that he had \"a lot\n\nto drink\".",
        "The Statement of Facts": "34 Counsel for the petitioner argued that the Statement of Facts merely\n\nstated that the petitioner had \"touched the victim’s right breast with his right\n\nhand\" and did not mention the necessary mens rea for the offence. Counsel therefore\n\nsubmitted that the court should exercise its revisionary powers and quash the conviction.35 The court has a legal duty to scrutinise the statement of facts for\n\nthe express purpose of ensuring that all the elements of the charge are made out therein:Mok\n\nSwee Kok v PP[1994] 3 SLR 140. This is an important safeguard where the accused\n\npleads guilty to the charge, for otherwise there would be no way in which the court could\n\ndecide whether the elements of the offence had been established, and thus no justification\n\nfor convicting the accused:Ganesun s/o Kannan v PP(supra). A petition for\n\nrevision can be presented on the ground that the statement of facts did not contain all\n\nthe elements which constitute the offence charged. However, it was not the purpose of a\n\ncriminal revision to become a convenient form of \"backdoor appeal\" against\n\nconviction for accused persons who had pleaded guilty to their charges. The governing\n\nprinciple was that the revisionary jurisdiction of the High Court should be invoked only\n\nif the court was satisfied that some serious injustice had been caused. The petition\n\nshould only be allowedwhereit wasmanifestly plain that the offence\n\ncharged was nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts tendered:Mok Swee Kok v PP(supra),Ngian Chin Boon v PP(supra),Teo Hee Heng v PP[2000] 3 SLR 168. It was only in such situations that the insufficiency of the statement of facts may\n\nbe said to have resulted in grave and serious injustice:Teo Hee Heng v PP(supra).36 In my opinion, no serious injustice had been caused in the present\n\ncase and there was nothing palpably wrong in the decision of the court below. Although the\n\nmens rea for the offence had not been expressly particularised in the statement of facts,\n\nit was not \"manifestly plain\" that the offence of outrage of modesty was\n\n\"nowhere disclosed in the statement of facts\". The statement of facts had\n\nrelated that the accused \"suddenly touched the victim’s right breast with his\n\nright hand\". Furthermore, the knowledge that the victim’s modesty would likely\n\nbe outraged could be inferred from the statement of facts. Given that the petitioner had\n\nasked for some wine from the victim and then suddenly touched the victim’s right\n\nbreast with his hand, it was very unlikely that the petitioner would not have known that\n\nsuch an act would thereby outrage her modesty.37 For the above reasons, I denied the application for revision.",
        "The appeal against sentence": "38 Under s 354 of the Penal Code the use of criminal force with intent\n\nto outrage modesty is punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years,\n\nor with fine, or with caning, or with any two of such punishments.39 Counsel for the petitioner contended that the sentence of 12\n\nmonths’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive. Counsel submitted that the judge below\n\nhad not given sufficient consideration to the following mitigating factors in this case:(1) The offence was committed on 1 November 2001 and the petitioner\n\n  pleaded guilty on 2 November 2001.(2) The petitioner had no known antecedents.(3) The petitioner had fully co-operated with the police.(4) The petitioner had made known to the court that he had a lot to\n\n  drink.(5) The petitioner only pleaded guilty to one charge and not to three.40 The standard sentence for an offence where the victim’s private\n\nparts or sexual organs have been intruded is nine months’ imprisonment with caning:Chandresh\n\nPatel v PP[1995] 1 CLAS News 323. In that case, the accused had touched the vaginal\n\narea of a female passenger whilst flying aboard a Singapore Airlines flight. He pleaded\n\nguilty to the charge and was sentenced to three months’ imprisonment. On appeal, the\n\nsentence was enhanced to six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.41 InTok Kok How v PP[1995] 1 SLR 735the petitioner had,\n\nwhilst sharing the complainant’s umbrella, repeatedly held her right shoulder with\n\nhis right hand despite her protestations. He had also asked her if she was afraid of being\n\nraped and he had used the knuckles of his left hand to press onto her right breast. He was\n\nsentenced tonine months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane. His\n\nappeal against sentence was dismissed. The court held that it was incorrect to say that\n\nthe petitioner had in no way intruded the complainant’s private parts. He had used\n\nhis knuckles to press onto her right breast and this was no light infraction falling\n\noutside the category of cases held inChandresh Patelto be deserving of\n\ncustodial sentences with caning.42 The sentencing guidelines have been applied in subsequent cases. InOng\n\nBuck Chuanv PP(MA 323/96/01, unreported), the petitioner sat next to the\n\nvictim on a bus and whilst the bus was moving, he folded his arms and used his fingers to\n\ntouch the side of the left breast of the victim. He was a first offender and pleaded\n\nguilty. He was sentenced to six months’ imprisonment and three strokes of the cane.43 The petitioner inChee Huck Chuan v PP(MA 262/96/01,\n\nunreported) pleaded guilty and was sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment without\n\ncaning as he was 63 years of age. In that case, the victim was making a call from a\n\ntelephone booth when she felt someone grabbing her from behind. At the same time, she felt\n\nthe same person touching her right breast. She managed to break free and the petitioner\n\nwas subsequently arrested.44 In my view, the sentence of 12 months’ imprisonment was not\n\nmanifestly excessive. I had noted in the case ofPP v George Nathan Edward(MA No\n\n144 of 2001) that in recent months the courts had witnessed an unchecked increase in the\n\nnumber of outrage of modesty cases, and as such a stiff sentence was necessary to deter\n\nlike-minded persons from committing such crimes. The circumstances in the present case\n\nwere similar to those inChandresh PatelandTok Kok How, but there\n\nwas an additional aggravating factor in this case – the petitioner had taken\n\nadvantage of the victim three times during the journey from Osaka to Singapore. The\n\npetitioner had in the earlier flight sector i.e., the flight travelling from Osaka to\n\nBangkok, touched the victim’s right breast and had stroked her left cheek with his\n\nright hand. On the same flight travelling from Bangkok to Singapore on the same day, the\n\npetitioner again used his hand to touch the same victim’s right breast when he asked\n\nher to serve him some wine.45 Although the petitioner had pleaded guilty to the charge, the\n\nprotection of the public from such intrusive behaviour of the petitioner had to be\n\nbalanced against his plea of guilt. It is settled law that the plea of guilt does not\n\nautomatically merit a discount in sentencing and might be overridden by other\n\nconsiderations. The court must consider the element of public interest before deciding\n\nwhether to give a discount and in some cases the need to protect the public might outweigh\n\nany mitigating effect to be attached to an accused’s guilty plea:Sim Gek Yong v\n\nPP[1995] 1 SLR 537. It has been subsequently reaffirmed that the protection of the\n\npublic is an exception to the general rule that the plea of guilt would entitle the\n\naccused to a discount:Lim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP[1998] 1 SLR 801. The petitioner in\n\nthis case had repeatedly outraged the modesty of the same victim and in my view his\n\npersistence in doing so had greatly reduced the mitigating value in his plea of guilt.46 As for the weight to be attached to the fact that the petitioner was\n\na first offender, I was of the opinion that the weight to be given to the\n\npetitioner’s absence of antecedents would be greater where there was positive\n\nevidence as to his good character rather than the negative inference from the absence of\n\nantecedents. The petitioner being of good character, which might be an inference from the\n\nfact that he was a first offender, could be said to be irrelevant as a mitigating factor\n\nbut relevant as an aggravating factor in that the offence was so much greater because he\n\nshould have known better: seePP v Tan Fook Sum[1999] 2 SLR 523. Similarly, the\n\nabsence of antecedents had to be weighed in the balance against other considerations, the\n\nmost crucial of which was the public interest. Being a first offender did not necessarily\n\nentitle the petitioner to a discount in sentencing:Sim Gek Yong v PP(supra). The\n\npetitioner’s allegation that he had \"a lot to drink\" would not be of any\n\nassistance to him either, as the commission of the offence while in a state of\n\nself-induced intoxication was not a mitigating factor:Mani Nedumaran v PP[1998] 1 SLR 411.47 For these reasons, I dismissed the appeal against sentence and\n\nenhanced the sentence to 24 months’ imprisonment.",
