        "The Prosecution’s submissions": "",
        "Importation Charge": "39 The sentencing framework in respect of drug trafficking and importation was laid down inSuventher([16] above). Under this framework, an indicative starting sentence is first determined by looking at the quantity of drugs involved; an upward or downward adjustment is then made taking into account the culpability of the accused, as well as whether aggravating or mitigating factors were present (Suventherat [17] and [28]). In relation to the second stage,Vasentha([16] above) provides a non-exhaustive list of indicia to assess an accused’s culpability (at [51]), as well as a non-exhaustive list of aggravating and mitigating factors (at [54] and [70]). TheSuventherframework was adapted and applied to importation of methamphetamine inKalangie([17] above). The indicative starting point 40 The indicative table specified by the Court of Appeal inKalangieat [80] was as follows: Sentencing BandQuantity of methamphetamine imported in gramsIndicative starting sentence in yearsCaning in strokes1167.00–192.9920–22152193.00–216.9923–253217.00–250.0026–29 41 The quantity of imported methamphetamine involved in the present case was not less than 249.99 g. As the amount in question was just shy of the maximum ceiling of Band 3, a starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment was appropriate. 42 The Defence argued that the starting point should be between 26 to 29 years. However,Kalangieexplained that the indicative starting sentence should be broadly proportional to the quantity of drugs imported as the gravity of the offence is to be chiefly measured by the quantity (at [81]). On the facts ofKalangie, the amount imported was 249.99 g of methamphetamine, similar to the present case; the court stated that the indicative starting sentence should be at the higher end of band 3 (at [81]). Thus, though it is not a mathematical exercise, generally the greater the quantity, the higher the starting point should be. Reduction for other factors would normally be addressed in the second stage. The appropriate starting point in this case was 29 years. The upward or downward adjustment 43 The proposed adjustment by the Prosecution is set out at [18] to [20] above, considering the aggravating factors, and the mitigating factors relied on by the Defence are set out at [29] to [31] above. (1) The relative youth of the Accused 44 The Defence relied on the case ofPham Duyen Quyen v Public Prosecutor[2017] 2 SLR 591 (“Pham CA”) to argue that youth is a mitigating factor.86Foot Note 86×DS at para 18The High Court inPublic Prosecutor v Pham Duyen Quyen[2016] 5 SLR 1289 (“Pham HC”) had considered that the accused was 24 at the time of hearing (at [1]), which was rather young, and treated it as a mitigating factor (at [58]). This was noted but not reversed inPham CA(at [58]). 45 In my view, the fact that the Accused was young when arrested, or that he was a new courier, could not be of much mitigation value in light of the huge quantity of drugs imported. Youth lessens culpability most when the offence was committed impulsively or because of lack of maturity; shoplifting from a dare, or because of a desire to fit in, or a desire to obtain the latest fashion accessory, are prime examples of situations where immaturity may attract some reduction of sentence. There, the hope is that the offence will not be repeated as the offender becomes older. In such situations, youth may attract hope for rehabilitation and reform. However, such concerns play a smaller role where the offence in question is more serious and involves greater criminality. The importation of drugs is such an offence. The severe consequences are well known; the harm resulting from such acts is pernicious and affects society as a whole. 46 This was noted inPham HCitself, relied on by the Defence. There, the High Court stated at [58]: In my decision on sentence, I took into account the mitigating factors, principally that she was a first offender and rather young. However, I could not ignore the fact that a large quantity of Methamphetamine was involved, even though the charge had been reduced to a non-capital offence. It was necessary for the sentence to reflect this large quantity, and also to reflect the sentences that have been imposed in similar cases. 47 As can be seen, although the judge noted the youth of the offender, this was outweighed or displaced by the huge amount of drugs imported, and a heavier sentence was necessary to reflect the large quantity. 48 Finally, it has been noted on various occasions that rehabilitation can be displaced as the dominant sentencing consideration for young offenders, where the crime is serious (Public Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz[2016] 1 SLR 334 at [30] cited inPublic Prosecutor v See Li Quan Mendel[2019] SGHC 255 (“Mendel See”) at [28] to [29]). The present case was such a case. 49  In any event, the Accused was not all that young; a young offender has been generally regarded as one who is 21 or below (Public Prosecutor v Mok Ping Wuen Maurice[1999] 1 SLR 138 at [21] cited inKow Keng Siong, Sentencing Principles in Singapore(Academy Publishing, 2009)(“Kow Keng Siong”) at para 22.002; see alsoMendel Seeat [28]). The Accused who was 23 years old at the time of his arrest should have had been mature enough to understand the consequences and gravity of his actions. 50 Though not couched as such in the Defence arguments, it may also be thought that imprisoning the Accused during the supposed best years of his life may be excessive and should be balanced by a lower sentence. I did not think that this was a substantial factor; a serious crime was committed and hence the young and the old, and those in-between, should all face the consequences of such serious acts to the same degree. InKow Keng Siongat para 27.134 citingR v Vaitos(1981) 4 A Crim R 238 at 301, it was observed that the mere fact that a young offender had to spend many of the best years of his life in imprisonment, serving a deserved long imprisonment sentence, did not mean that the sentence should be disturbed. (2) Financial gain 51 I agreed with the Defendant at [30] above that financial gain is ordinarily not an aggravating factor. The Court of Appeal inKalangieat [82]([17] above)had established that the motivation of financial gain, without more, cannot be considered aggravating as most drug importers would be motivated by some form of material gain and such motivation did not make it materially more serious than any other typical case: … However, we respectfully did not agree with the Judge that the fact that the Accused was motivated by financial gain in making the drug deliveries could, without more, be considered aggravating. It appeared to us that most drugs traffickers or importers would be motivated by some form of financial or material gain, and that the presence of such motivation did not render the offence materially more serious, or the offender more culpable, than any other case of drug trafficking or importation. It might be otherwise if there was something exceptional about the circumstances of the case, such as the role of the offender or the amount of the gain but nothing of that kind was proven in the present case. 52 There was nothing exceptional about the Accused’s financial motivation in the present case and it was only a neutral factor. (3) Concealment of drugs 53 The Prosecution argued that the fact that the Accused had personally concealed the imported drugs in the car was a separate aggravating factor, over and above indicating that the Accused had premeditated and planned the commission of the offence ([19] above). Hence, the Prosecution’s case seems to be that concealment of imported drugs ultimately counts as two aggravating factors. 54 However, not all attempts to conceal drugs should be regarded as an aggravating factor. It is inherent in almost all importation offences for the drugs to be concealed. There are hardly any accused persons who would import drugs into Singapore by placing the drugs openly on the car seat or walking into Singapore with the drugs in his hand in a transparent plastic bag. Accused persons will naturally conceal the drugs that they intend to import. Treating all forms of concealment as an aggravating factor would lead to the conclusion that all, or almost all, offences of importation are aggravated. 55 Attempts to conceal the drugs being imported should only be regarded as an aggravating factor where the circumstances suffice to distinguish them from typical importation offences, such as when they are being concealed in an unusually sophisticated manner to avoid detection. An example of this can be seen inKalangie, as was raised by the Defence ([31] above). 56 Nevertheless, the lack of concealment and/or the lack of sophisticated concealment are not mitigating factors, but are at best neutral. 57 In the present case, while the Defence described the Accused’s concealment of the drugs as not being sophisticated, he did hide the drugs in the boot, which was a clear attempt to evade detection. It may not have succeeded, but such failure could neither absolve nor mitigate. (4) Lack of cooperation 58 No further reduction could be given for any cooperation; while the Accused claimed that he had given the authorities all the information sought, he did not provide information leading to the identification of Shafiq. Such lack of information would not mean that he merited a heavier sentence, but it did mean that he could not avail himself of any additional reduction. (5) Guilty plea 59 In light of the above, the only mitigating factor was that the Accused had chosen to plead guilty. His lack of antecedents and limited role as a courier were not mitigating factors, but at best neutral. The lack of an aggravating factor is not a mitigating factor, but is only neutral. (6) Sentencing precedents 60 The Defence relied on the following precedents to argue for a sentence lower than 27 years. 61 The Accused’s sentence should be lower than that imposed inMohd Akebal s/o Ghulam Jilani v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2020] 1 SLR 266. There, the second appellant was sentenced to 27.5 years imprisonment for instigating the trafficking of not less than 14.46 g of diamorphine (at [8]) (anything more than 15 g crosses the capital threshold, as seen in the Second Schedule to the MDA). The court held that the quantum of drugs alone may not have warranted a sentence of 27.5 years, but there were aggravating factors that warranted such a sentence, namely: that the second appellant was not a one-off trafficker but had been involved in trafficking as a business; and that he was involved as a part of a group of operatives who were conducting these activities (at [18]). The present Accused lacked these aggravating factors and should be awarded a lower sentence.87Foot Note 87×DS at paras 15 to 16 62  The Accused’s sentence should also be lower than that inPublic Prosecutor v Muhamad Nor Rakis Bin Husin[2017] SGDC 174.88Foot Note 88×DS at para 17There, the accused was sentenced to 27 years imprisonment for importing not less than 247.04 g of methamphetamine; the accused there did not plead guilty, and had drug-related antecedents. This was explained inKalangie([17] above) at [86]. The lack of antecedents and guilty plea in the present case support a lower sentence than in that case. 63 I accepted that these cases indicated that the appropriate sentence for the Accused here should be lower than 27 years. 64 The Prosecution disagreed, arguing that the 27 years’ imprisonment sought was consistent withKalangieandPublic Prosecutor v Poopathi Chinaiyah s/o Paliandi[2020] SGHC 37 (“Poopathi”).89Foot Note 89×PS at para 14 65 InKalangie, 25 years was awarded to the accused who had voluntarily confessed, cooperated with the authorities and pleaded guilty for importing 249.99 g of methamphetamine (at [83]); the Prosecution argued that an uplift was required in the present case as the Accused had another importation charge taken into consideration, did not provide information leading to the identification of Shafiq, and did not surrender to authorities as the drugs were only found after a thorough search of his car.90Foot Note 90×PS at paras 15 to 16 66 InPoopathi, the accused was given 28 years imprisonment for trafficking of 499.99 g of cannabis, as well as shorter sentences for trafficking of diamorphine and possession of cannabis, with a further TIC charge of trafficking of methamphetamine (at [1] to [4]).91Foot Note 91×PS at para 17The aggravating factors considered were that: the accused had an antecedent for trafficking; the accused had been released only in 2015 before reoffending in 2018 and had been undeterred; and the accused had admitted to another TIC charge of trafficking 25.45 g of methamphetamine (at [22(c)] and [27]). 67 The Prosecution argued that the Accused’s culpability was more similar to that ofPoopathi, as compared toKalangie,as:92Foot Note 92×PS at para 19the Accused had failed to cooperate with the CNB officers in identifying Shafiq; and also because in the present case there was a TIC Importation Charge of importing 499.99 g of vegetable matter containing cannabis, a large amount, which was a far higher quantum than in the TIC charge of trafficking 25.45 g of methamphetamine inPoopathi. 68 I accepted that the Accused’s culpability was higher than that inKalangie, given the significant weight awarded to the voluntary confession and cooperation in that case (at [83]). However, it should be noted that inKalangie, the sophisticated concealment of the drugs was regarded as an aggravating factor (at [82]). The lack of such concealment in the present case meant that although the Accused was more culpable than inKalangie, his culpability was slightly offset by the lack of concealment. The appropriate sentence should hence be slightly higher than the 25 years inKalangie, but lower than 27 years, as stated above. 69 I did not consider this case as equivalent to that ofPoopathi, as the accused in that case was a repeat trafficker who had criminal antecedents. The accused inPoopathiwas also charged with multiple trafficking charges, as opposed to the single proceeded importation charge in the present case.93Foot Note 93×PS at para 17 (7) Charges taken into consideration 70 The Defence argued at [35] above, relying onShouffee,that no uplift in sentence should be awarded for the TIC charges, as they were part of the same single transaction as the proceeded charges. However, this reliance onShouffeewas misplaced.Shouffeestands for the proposition that multiple proceeded individual charges which form part of the same transaction should in general be run concurrently (at [27]); it did not discuss the issue of whether the sentence of a proceeded individual charge should be enhanced based on a TIC charge which was part of the same transaction as the proceeded charge. No authority was provided by the Defence in relation to the latter issue. 71 There may be a question of under what circumstances the sentence for a proceeded charge may be enhanced by a TIC charge which forms part of the same transaction as the proceeded charge. This may need to be addressed with the benefit of fuller arguments on the issue, but it was in my view not necessary to fully discuss this in the present case as the below was sufficient. 72 I found that the sentence for the Importation Charge could be enhanced on grounds that the TIC charges reflected aggravated criminality. It was noted inPublic Prosecutor v UI[2008] 4 SLR(R) 500 (“UI”) at [38], citingNavaseelan Balasingam v Public Prosecutor[2007] 1 SLR(R) 767 at [17], that where an accused had agreed for multiple similar charges to be TIC, that meant that he had committed many more similar offences and that fact must aggravate the charges proceeded with. This supported that the proceeded charges be enhanced, to reflect the aggravated criminality reflected in the multiplicity of charges. 73 That said, I noted the primary limiting factor that the overall sentence uplift from the TIC charges should not exceed the uplift in the case where all charges had in fact been proceeded with. This was noted inUIat [36]: … [The accused] can also be fairly sure that, despite the TIC offences being considered by the sentencing court, the increase in the severity of his sentence for the offences proceeded with will be less draconian than the sentence which he would have received had the Prosecution proceeded with the TIC offences as well. 74 It was open to the court to enhance the sentence for the Importation Charge on the basis that the Accused had imported a variety of drugs, this being regarded as an aggravating factor in certain situations (Vasenthaat [64] to [67]). Sundaresh Menon CJ inShouffeehad explained that a higher sentence for importing of a variety of drugs would be warranted where it can be inferred from this that there was a higher degree of sophistication in the offender’s drug operations, or that he had been conducting it on a larger scale (at [67]). The question in each case is whether the variety of drugs showed that the accused was more culpable, such that he required a more onerous sentence (Shouffeeat [67]). 75 I was satisfied that the circumstances in the present case showed a greater culpability on the part of the Accused, than if he had only committed the singular crime of importing methamphetamine. Apart from the TIC Importation Charge which showed that the Accused had been involved in importing a variety of drugs, the Accused also had a TIC Trafficking Charge. This TIC Trafficking Charge was not part of the same transaction as the Importation Charge, since there was no proximity of place or time, and the bundles involved being separate bundles of drugs. This showed that the Accused had been involved in a variety of drug crimes and such trafficking and/or importation were not one-off offences. These factors seen together aggravated the Accused’s culpability and could be used to enhance the sentence for the Importation Charge. This would not prejudice the Accused, as such aggravation would similarly have had been present even if all the charges had been proceeded with; the Accused would not be worse off with the charges being taken into consideration, as compared to them being proceeded with. (8) Conclusion 76 Overall, considering the guilty plea, the precedents, and the TIC charges in the present case, I was satisfied that a sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment and the specified 15 strokes of the cane was an appropriate sentence for the Importation Charge. The two year reduction from the starting point of 29 years as argued for by the Prosecution did not align with the precedents and give sufficient weight to the circumstances, particularly the guilty plea, and a three year reduction was more appropriate.",
        "Consumption Charge": "32 The Defence sought 12 months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge.78Foot Note 78×DS at para 32The Accused was not an addict, was new to consumption of methamphetamine and did not have a high level of consumption.79Foot Note 79×MP at paras 28 to 30; DS at para 36 33 On noting that the Prosecution was only seeking 9 months’ imprisonment for consumption, the Defence submitted orally that that was appropriate.80Foot Note 80×Hearing Minute at p 3",
        "Possession Charge": "34 The Defence sought 12 months’ imprisonment, being consistent with that of the Accused’s wife.81Foot Note 81×DS at paras 38 to 39",
        "Total charge": "25 The Prosecution argued that the sentences for the Importation Charge and the Possession Charge should be run consecutively as the offences violated different legally protected interests (Public Prosecutor vRaveen Balakrishnan[2018] 5 SLR 799 at [39]), giving a total of 28 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.62Foot Note 62×PS at para 25This would not be crushing as it reflects the overall criminality of the Accused’s offences.63Foot Note 63×PS at para 25",
        "The Mitigation and Defence Submissions": "26 In mitigation, the Defence pointed to the background and personal circumstances of the Accused: he was only 23 years at the time of his arrest, and 25 years old at the time of the hearing;64Foot Note 64×Mitigation Plea dated 6 March 2020 (“MP”) at para 5he was unemployed when arrested and had worked in various odd jobs including delivery and moving; he was married and the couple was renting the flat that they resided in; his mother hoped that the Accused would be able to take care of household matters after he is released, when she reached old age.65Foot Note 65×MP at paras 6 to 10 27 The Accused expressed his remorse and had “surrendered” the drugs to the CNB officers at his house.66Foot Note 66×MP at paras 17 to 22, 38 to 39He had no antecedents, and this was the first time he was involved in importing drugs.67Foot Note 67×MP at paras 25 to 27He had co-operated with the CNB officers in their investigations and volunteered all the information relevant to his case; he could not provide further information about Shafiq to the authorities because he did not know any more than what he had told the CNB officers.68Foot Note 68×MP at para 32The Accused wishes to study during his imprisonment and prepare for future prospects when released.69Foot Note 69×MP at para 40",
        "TIC Charges": "35 It was further argued that no increase in sentence should result from the TIC charges: the TIC Importation Charge was part of the same transaction as the Importation Charge, which both involved Shafiq;82Foot Note 82×DS at para 42the TIC Possession Charge and the TIC Trafficking Charge were part of the same transaction as the Possession Charge, as they were all surrendered during the same house raid at the same place and time.83Foot Note 83×DS at para 43The Defence relied onMohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2 SLR 998 (“Shouffee”).84Foot Note 84×DS at paras 42 to 43 36 The global sentence should be 23 years, being appropriate under the totality principle.85Foot Note 85×DS at para 50",
        "The Decision": "37 I was of the view that the appropriate sentences were: 26 years and 15 strokes for the Importation Charge; 9 months’ imprisonment for the Consumption Charge; and 1 year for the Possession Charge. The sentences for the Importation and Possession charges were ordered to run consecutively, with the sentence for the Consumption Charge running concurrently. The global sentence was 27 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane, backdated to the date of first remand, 17 Oct 2017.",
        "Analysis": "38 The sentences imposed were appropriate taking into account the applicable framework and the circumstances of these offences as well as those of the Accused.",
        "The Consumption and Possession Charge": "77 The sentences for the Consumption Charge and Possession Charge were not in dispute. The Defendant initially submitted that 12 months’ imprisonment was appropriate for the Consumption Charge ([32] above); the Prosecution submitted that this should attract at least nine months’ imprisonment ([21] to [22] above). Taking into account that the Accused was neither a very young offender, nor on the other hand a more habitual drug taker, I was of the view that nine months’ imprisonment was sufficient punishment for the Consumption Charge, considering all the circumstances. 78 Both parties agreed that 12 months imprisonment for the Possession Charge was appropriate, bringing the sentence into parity with the Accused’s wife’s sentence ([24] and [34] above). There was nothing on the facts to require a differentiation from what was imposed for the Accused’s wife, and given that the couple possessed the drugs jointly, the imposition of the same term of imprisonment was appropriate.  However, instead of 12 months’ imprisonment, I imposed one year’s imprisonment to make the running of sentences more convenient.",
        "Running of Sentences": "79 Under s 307(1) of the CPC, at least two of the sentences had to run consecutively. It was to my mind sufficient to order the sentences for the Importation Charge and Possession Charge to run consecutively, giving a total of 27 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes. The overall sentence was commensurate with the criminality involved. This was backdated to the date of first remand.",
        "Conclusion": "80 The sentences were imposed accordingly in the circumstances. Aedit AbdullahJudge Chan Yi Cheng and Kenneth Kee (Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the prosecution; Rupert Seah Eng Chee (Rupert Seah & Co.) and Krishna Ramakrishna Sharma (Fleet Street Law LLP) for the accused."
