        "THE DEFENDANTS’ APPEAL AND\nMY DECISION": "25 Before me, Counsel for the\nDefendants stated that he was not asking for the documents in the second category as they\nwould be subsumed in the first. Similarly, he conceded that the third category of\ndocuments ought to be subsumed in the fourth. He argued that the Plaintiffs were an exempt\nprivate limited company and their accounts were not available to the public. The\nDefendants were therefore entitled to their accounting documents. He conceded, however,\nthat the Defendants’ request was rather too wide and was content to leave out the\ndocuments for 1998. As for the fifth category relating to the change of name, he argued\nthat this issue was one of the particulars of malice alleged by the Plaintiffs and the\nDefendants were entitled to such documents because of their Defence of qualified\nprivilege.26 Order 24 rule 1 of the Rules\nof Court provides:\"Order for discovery (O.\n    24, r. 1)1. (1) Subject to this Rule\n    and Rules 2 and 7, the Court may at any time order any party to a cause or matter (whether\n    begun by writ, originating summons or otherwise) to give discovery by making and serving\n    on any other party a list of the documents which are or have been in his possession,\n    custody or power, and may at the same time or subsequently also order him to make and file\n    an affidavit verifying such a list and to serve a copy thereof on the other party.(2) The documents which a party\n    to a cause or matter may be ordered to discover under paragraph (1) are as follows:(a) the documents on which the\n            party relies or will rely; and(b) the documents which could\n            –(i) adversely affect his own\n            case;(ii) adversely affect another\n            party’s case; or(iii) support another\n            party’s case.(3) An order under this Rule may\n    be limited to such documents or classes of documents only, or to only such of the matters\n    in question in the cause or matter, as may be specified in the order.\"27 Order 24 rule 2 concerns\ndetermination of an issue or question before discovery and is not relevant to the case\nhere. Order 24 rule 7 mandates that discovery is to be ordered only if necessary. It\nstates:\"7. On the hearing of an\n    application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery\n    is not necessary, or not necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as\n    the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an\n    order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for\n    disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs.\"28 InBusiness Software\nAlliance & Ors v S M Summit Holdings Ltd & Anor[2000] 2 SLR 733, the\nDefendants in the libel action there filed two applications for a further and better list\nof documents and specific discovery of certain documents from the Plaintiffs. At paragraph\n33 of the judgment, the Court of Appeal said:\"33. We now come to the\n        documents the defendants seek from the plaintiffs. The question is whether the documents\n        sought satisfy the test of relevancy. …\"The Court of Appeal then dealt\nwith thePeruvian Guano Co case[1882 – 83] 11 QBD 55 andMcDonald’s\nCorp. & Anor v Steel & Anor[1995] 3 AER 616and continued (at paragraphs 35\nand 36):\"35. Mr Elias submits that\n    the requirements set out above are satisfied on the facts. The particulars of\n    justification state that Summit CD ‘habitually accepted, processed and delivered\n    orders for stampers and CD-Roms’ from the alleged software pirates. These particulars\n    were pleaded on the basis of the information provided by Pan and Shi and were therefore\n    well grounded. The defendants are therefore entitled to discovery of documents to\n    substantiate what they have pleaded.36. We are unable to accept this\n    argument. Whilst the particulars of justification do clearly refer to dealings with the\n    alleged software pirates, this alone does not give the defendants carte blanche to empty\n    the plaintiffs’ filing cabinets. In defamation actions thePeruvian Guanoprinciple is subject to the well established rule that a defendant is not permitted to\n    mount a fishing expedition through the discovery process in the hope of finding something\n    to justify his libellous words. The documents in category (1) are described as ‘All\n    the invoices, sales orders, delivery orders and/or correspondence’ of Summit CD\n    relating to the alleged software pirates. That is a remarkably wide class of documents\n    which would encompass any letter or note on any matter whatsoever between Summit CD and\n    the alleged pirates. The lack of specificity in this regard can only lead us to infer\n    that, in fact, the defendants have no knowledge of any particular transactions which would\n    substantiate their plea of justification. That being the case, they are clearly trying to\n    empty the cupboards in the hope of finding something to substantiate their plea. This\n    amounts to a fishing expedition. We do not readMcDonald’scase as\n    saying that by merely pleading that a particular fact is true, a defendant in a libel\n    action is entitled to obtain by discovery all the plaintiffs’ documents to see\n    whether there is anything in them to sustain the plea. All that case says is that a plea\n    of justification will not be struck out before the trial on the basis that there is no\n    ‘clear and sufficient’ evidence to sustain it, as some previous authorities\n    seemed to suggest. In any event, that case did not concern the issue of relevancy of the\n    documents sought in discovery and is therefore of limited assistance to the\n    defendants.\"34 Applying these principles to\nthe Defendants’ application here, the first category of documents (which includes the\nsecond category, as conceded by the Defendants) was indeed remarkably wide in that it\ncovered all accounting records of theentireGlobal Group over three years. If the\nDefendants were correct in their assertion that they were entitled to all such documents,\nthey would effectively be espousing the following proposition:If Defendant is sued for defaming\n    Plaintiff by alleging that Plaintiff is in financial difficulties and Defendant pleads the\n    defence of justification, Defendant is entitled to ask Plaintiff to disclose all his\n    financial records (including bank statements) for the preceding three years.The above proposition is\nstartling because it would in effect be reversing the burden of proof – i.e. the\nPlaintiff has to divulge all his confidential financial matters to the Defendant to show\nthat he is not in financial difficulties.35 Merely stating that they\nbelieved that \"the Plaintiffs had suffered losses ininter aliatheir trading\nactivities in Malaysia and the Middle East\" could not assist the Defendants in their\nunjustifiable quest to hopefully catch some fish of justification somewhere in the expanse\nof the Global ocean. It is akin to the situation where A says B is in financial straits as\nhe has lost money in shares and, when sued for defamation, tells B to reveal all his and\nhis family’s financial records for the last three years.36 Since the Plaintiffs’\naudited accounts were not available to the public at large, as an indulgence to the\nDefendants, I was prepared to order that only the Plaintiffs’ (and not the Global\nGroup’s) audited accounts for financial years 1999 and 2000 be disclosed. I ordered\nsuch disclosure by the Plaintiffs within seven days from my order.37 Where the third and fourth\ncategories of documents were concerned, it was apparent from the Defendants’\nsupporting affidavit that they had no basis in saying that the Plaintiffs or the Global\nGroup had any documents pertaining to any dealings with Thome & Partners. Further, it\nwas strange that the Defendants were asking for documents relating to the sale of\n\"Global Excellence\" when the Plaintiffs had pleaded that they had not offered\nthat vessel for sale. These roaming searches could only lead to the inference that the\nDefendants lacked knowledge of any particular facts which would substantiate their plea of\njustification. I therefore affirmed the Assistant Registrar’s refusal to order\ndiscovery of these categories.38 The last category of documents\nwas in relation to the change of name of \"Star Progress\" to \"Dunia\nBintang\". From the pleadings, the only issue that arose from this was the assertion\nby the Plaintiffs that the change of name took place in January 2000. Although I affirmed\nthe Assistant Registrar’s refusal to order discovery of these documents, upon further\nreflection, I think it would have been fair to order discovery of documents evidencing the\ndate of change and nothing else. The subsequent news release by the Defendants on 21 March\n2001 merely referred to the new name without acknowledging that the change of name had\ntaken place in January 2000.39 The Defendants failed in their\nappeal by and large except for the documents mentioned in paragraph 36 of this judgment. I\ntherefore ordered them to pay $1,200 costs to the Plaintiffs in respect of the appeal. I\ndo not think what I have said in the preceding paragraph about documents pertaining to the\ndate of change would have affected my decision on the issue of costs.40 On 19 July 2001, upon the\nrequest of the Plaintiffs, I granted them an extension of time until 20 August 2001 to\nfurnish the documents ordered to be disclosed as their audited accounts for financial year\n2000 were not available yet.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
