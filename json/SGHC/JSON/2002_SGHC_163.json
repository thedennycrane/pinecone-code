This was an appeal arising from a district court judgment dismissing\n\nthe appellants' claim for restitution of $33,000 paid as part of a sum of $38,000\n\npurported to be the deposit for the rental of two rooms of a Housing And Development Board\n\n(\"HDB\") flat belonging to the respondents. The appellants are two sisters who\n\nwanted to purchase a flat in the Hougang area near the homes of their other siblings. The\n\nrespondents are a husband and wife who worked as hawkers and were, at the material time,\n\nin urgent need of money. The respondents decided to place their flat on sale in order to\n\nraise funds. To that end, in September 1999, they engaged the services of a housing agent\n\nby the name of Raymond Lim, who, at that time, was employed by the firm of R. Paiman &\n\nAssociates. The appellants responded to an advertisement of the sale placed by Raymond Lim\n\non behalf of the respondents.The Problem2. Raymond Lim was told by Lim Chong Seng (the first respondent and\n\nhusband of the second respondent) that he needed cash of $30,000 but the respondents had\n\nnot occupied the flat for the minimum period of occupation required under the Housing And\n\nDevelopment Board Act, Ch 129. This fact meant that the respondents were precluded from\n\nselling or entering into an agreement to sell the flat by reason of s 49A of the Act. This\n\nimportant statutory provision says:\"(1) Except with the prior written consent of the Board, no owner\n\n  of any flat, house, or other building which has been sold by the Board under the\n\n  provisions of this Part shall, within the prescribed minimum occupation period, by\n\n  contract agreement or otherwise,sell or agree to sellhis flat, house or\n\n  other building or any estate or interest therein to any person. (my emphasis)(2) Unless otherwise authorised by the Board, every contract,\n\n  agreement, or other document relating to the sale of any such flat, house or other\n\n  building which is made between the owner of the flat, house or other building and a\n\n  purchaser other than the Board shall be in the prescribed form.(3)Any contract, agreementor other document which is\n\n  made on or after the commencement of the Housing And Development (Amendment) Act 1998in\n\n  contravention of subsection (1) or (2) shall be null and void. (my emphasis)The Plan3. An ostensibly ingenious plan was proposed to help the respondents\n\nget around the prohibition under s 49A. It is not clear who hatched the plan because\n\nRaymond Lim and the first respondent each said it was the other who came up with the idea.\n\nFrom the evidence, including the affidavit of evidence-in-chief of the first appellant, it\n\nappears more likely that the plan was the brainchild of Raymond Lim. The plan was palpably\n\nsimple. The respondents were to enter into an agreement to lease two rooms of their flat\n\nto the appellants for a monthly rent of $1,000. The agreement would be titled \"Lease\n\nWith Option To Purchase\". Such an agreement was signed on 29 September 1999 in the\n\noffice of a solicitor, (\"the solicitor\", of whom, more later). The agreement\n\nprovided for the rental of two rooms for a period of two years at a monthly rent of\n\n$1,000.00. The agreement also contained an option to purchase the flat, at the price of\n\n$245,000, to be exercised two months after 1 August 2000 \"when the Landlord is\n\nlegally capable of executing Sale and Purchase agreement according to by-law\". Under\n\nthe agreement, the appellants were to commence the tenancy of the two rooms on 1 March\n\n2000. It is useful to note the undisputed fact that the lease was only for two rooms\n\nbecause a tenancy over the entire flat would have required an approval from the HDB, and\n\nthe tenancy agreement would have to be in an HDB approved form.The Cash Involved4. Before we move to what took place in the office of the solicitor, it\n\nis necessary to mention two other monetary items. First, Raymond Lim obtained a signed\n\nauthorization from the respondents to appoint him as their exclusive agent. Under the\n\nterms of that agreement he was to receive $17,000 by way of commission. It was obvious\n\nfrom the evidence at trial that Raymond Lim was unable to give a convincing answer as to\n\nhow he justified being paid such a large sum for what was to be a tenancy agreement. He\n\nmade alternative statements such as, \"the owner willingly paid this sum\", and\n\n\"the tenancy also included an option to purchase\" (hence, the commission in\n\nrespect of the $245,000 purchase price was not exorbitant). Secondly, under the lease\n\nagreement, the appellants had to pay a deposit of $38,000. It was not disputed that $5,000\n\nhad been paid earlier, but also in September. This was meant to be paid to the respondents\n\nbut Raymond stated in his evidence-in-chief that he took the money and gave only $3,500 to\n\nthe respondents. This part was not disputed. The balance of $33,000 due as deposit was\n\nagreed to be paid at the solicitor's office on 29 October 1999. This date was scheduled to\n\nenable the appellants to collect the money from the sale of their own flat, the completion\n\nof which was on 28 October 1999.At The Lawyer's Office5. On 29 September 1999 the appellants went to the solicitor's office,\n\naccompanied by two male relatives. The respondents were already there with Raymond Lim.\n\nThe solicitor then explained the \"Lease With Option To Purchase\" to the parties.\n\nHe advised the appellants that they may compel the respondents to sell the flat by an\n\norder of court order the respondents refuse to carry out the sale. The documents were\n\nsigned with the lawyer as witness. He then told the appellants that they had to pay\n\n$33,000. The appellants handed the money to him in cash which he counted and then handed\n\nover to Raymond Lim. Raymond Lim then issued a receipt from his own receipt book which he\n\ndated 29 November (not October) 1999. The respondents were asked to sign the receipt which\n\nthey did. Raymond then told the parties to pay the solicitor's fees of $250.75 each. This\n\nwas done and the solicitor issued a receipt for that. The solicitor was asked under\n\ncross-examination as to which party he was acting for and he replied that he acted for\n\nneither. He continued by repeating his evidence-in-chief where he said that he was only\n\nthere to read and explain the lease to the parties. He said that they wanted to sign the\n\nlease before a solicitor and so he was there to do just that. He concluded by saying that\n\nthereafter he \"had no part, nor was aware of what was going on among the\n\n[appellants], [respondents], and [Raymond Lim] who was in overall charge of the whole\n\nmatter.\" He had also conceded that the lease was drafted by Raymond Lim. Having taken\n\nthat stance, he nonetheless rendered a bill (under the file reference of\n\n\"CNT/jt/RAYMOND 6\") addressed to the appellants as well as the respondents as\n\ntenant and landlord respectively charging them professional fees based on the scale fees\n\nin respect of work for landlord and tenant. The bill was paid.Where Did The $33,000 go?6. There is conflicting evidence as to what happened to the cash.\n\nRaymond Lim's evidence was that he took $10,000 and handed the remaining $23,000 to the\n\nfirst respondent. The respondents say that Raymond Lim did not hand any money to them. The\n\nfirst respondent said that when they were out of the solicitor's office Raymond Lim told\n\nhim that he would have the \"documents endorsed by the court and he'll give everything\n\nto [the first respondent] when it's done\"(NE page 155). The respondents testified\n\nthat after 29 October 1999 Raymond Lim vanished after that and did not respond when paged.\n\nRaymond Lim's explanation at trial was that he was in the library, reading up to 9 or 10\n\no'clock at night. I am always heartened to find people with strong reading habits, but\n\nunfortunately, the trial judge here did not appear to believe Raymond Lim, and I have no\n\ncause to disagree with her. In fact, from the record, the trial judge was clearly entitled\n\nto regard Raymond Lim as the villain of the piece. Whether there was more than one villain\n\nis a matter for inquiry elsewhere, and is not relevant for the purposes of this appeal. I\n\ncontinue. After failing to contact Raymond Lim, the first respondent reported him to the\n\npolice. Raymond Lim re-emerged only two days before the first respondent was scheduled to\n\nbe interviewed by the officers from the Criminal Investigation Department. He went to see\n\nthe first respondent late one evening and engaged him in conversation. The trial judge\n\nnoted that his purpose was to manoeuvre the first respondent into admitting that he (the\n\nfirst respondent) was in trouble and needed his (Raymond Lim's) help. The conversation\n\ncarried on with a mixture of tricks and threats, but the ploy did not work. Not\n\nsurprisingly, the trial judge formed a dim view of the exercise by Raymond Lim.Receipt And Receipt Of Money7. The trial judge relied onSorrell v Finch[ 1977] AC 728 for\n\nthe proposition that an estate agent receives deposits as an agent of the vendor only when\n\nhe is authorised to do so; otherwise, he holds it as stakeholder pending the outcome of a\n\nfuture event. In this regard, Lord Edmund-Davies adopted the dissenting judgment of Lord\n\nDenning inBurt v Claude Cousins & Co Ltd[1971] 2 QB 426 which was directly on\n\npoint. However, I would caution against reliance on these authorities for the factual\n\nsituation in this case. InSorrell, for example, the estate agent went about\n\ncollecting deposits, without authority but before any agreement had been concluded. It was\n\na straightforward case of whether there was actual authority or implied authority; and the\n\ncourt took the view that there was neither. I am in full agreement with that view. The\n\nfacts here are different. The meeting was held precisely for the purpose of sealing the\n\ndeal and pay over the deposit. In the absence of any other party, the money would go\n\ndirectly from purchaser to vendor. In this case, the money was handed by the purchaser to\n\ntheir solicitor. The obvious implication must be that the lawyer has to hand over the\n\nmoney to the vendor if he is satisfied that it was safe to do so. If he handed the money\n\nto the wrong party and that party absconded with the money, the lawyer would have to\n\nexplain why he did not hand the money to the vendor. Hence, on the facts, while I would\n\nnot disturb the judge's finding that the respondents had not received the $33,000, it is\n\nnot on the strength of theSorrell v Finchargument, namely that Raymond Lim held\n\nthe money as stakeholder. On the facts, the money was handed to the solicitor. If there\n\nwas any stakeholder, it was the solicitor. The question, which was not raised at trial, is\n\nwhether the solicitor was entitled to hand the money to Raymond Lim (a person who had no\n\nreason to receive the money)?8. Counsel for the appellants submitted, as was done at trial, that the\n\nrespondents had acknowledge receipt of the $33,000 and therefore cannot resile from the\n\ndocumented admission. I think that as a general rule, a person must be held to his signed\n\nreceipt; but as was pointed out by the LP Thean JA in the Court of Appeal case ofFook\n\nGee Finance Co Ltd v Liu Cho Chit & Anor[1998] 2 SLR 121, at 24, an\n\nacknowledgement of receipt cannot have the effect of \"treating what has not been paid\n\nas having been paid\". I need only emphasize that a signed receipt must naturally be\n\ngiven great weight when the issue concerns whether or not the signor had received the\n\nmoney. But he is entitled to persuade the court that he did not in fact receive the money.\n\nThe court has to weigh other evidence against the signed receipt in determining the fact\n\nof receipt. In this case, the trial judge accepted the evidence of the respondents that\n\nthey did not receive the money. I need not repeat the evidence here save to observe that\n\nthe receipt signed by the respondents was a receipt prepared by Raymond Lim. What was\n\nRaymond Lim's business in issuing a receipt in these circumstances? It appears that the\n\nsolicitor may have assumed that Raymond Lim was acting as the agent for the respondents,\n\nbut was that a reasonable assumption given that the principals themselves were present\n\nbefore him? The incontrovertible evidence was that the money was taken by Raymond Lim. The\n\ncrucial issue was whether Raymond Lim had handed over the money to the respondents. In\n\nthis regard, the judge disbelieved Raymond Lim. Furthermore, it appears that not only was\n\nthe receipt prepared and issued by Raymond Lim, it was signed before Raymond Lim\n\npurportedly handed the money over to the respondents. In these circumstances, the trial\n\njudge was entitled give little weight to the receipt.Null And Void Contract9. The trial judge, relying onArchbolds (Freightage) Ltd v S\n\nSpanglett Ltd[1961] 1 QB 374, held that in order to recover their money, the\n\nappellants were obliged to rely on their contractual rights under the lease with option to\n\npurchase agreement, and that being an illegal agreement, rendered null and void under the\n\nHDB Act, the appellants' reliance was worthless. The judge dismissed the argument that the\n\nagreement was only a tenancy agreement and therefore not invalidated by s 49A of the HDB\n\nAct. I agree that many of the important terms were inconsistent with a two-year tenancy of\n\ntwo rooms in a flat where the rental was only $1,000 a month. It is at once obvious that\n\nthe deposit of $38,00 far exceeded the total rental for the entire period of tenancy.\n\nFurthermore, the commission of $17,000 extracted by the housing agent was far in excess of\n\na commission for finding a rented premises in the circumstances. But the inescapable fact\n\nis that the written agreement offered the appellants an option to purchase, with a\n\ncondition that their deposit of $38,000 would be forfeited if they do not exercise the\n\noption. So, notwithstanding that the agreement mentioned that the option may only be\n\nexercised after the respondents become legally entitled to sell, the agreement itself isan\n\nagreement to sellwithin the express wording of s 49A(1). Furthermore, throughout\n\nthe evidence recorded in the Notes Of Evidence, it appears that all the parties concerned\n\nregarded the transaction as an agreement for the sale and purchase of the flat and not a\n\ntenancy agreement. At page 48, the notes of evidence of the second appellant reads:\"Q: Did you sign a contract with the [respondents] Mr. Lim and Mdm\n\n  Chua?A: Yes, the agreement pertaining to the purchase of the house.\"And in his evidence-in-chief the first respondent said at 5 -\n\n\"My house was sold within three days at $245,000\". The spirit and intention of\n\nthe parties, therefore, went clearly against the spirit and purpose of s 49A in as much as\n\ntheir agreement went contrary to the letter of that provision.Amending The Claim After Trial10. The appellants' counsel made an alternative submission on the basis\n\nof money had and received, and a further alternative of mistake of law. These submissions\n\nwere rejected by the trial judge on the ground that these claims were not pleaded. SeeMFH\n\nMarine Pte Ltd v Asmonah Bin Mohamad[2000] 4 SLR 368. I agree with her. In any event,\n\non the facts as the judge had found, these claims had to be made, not against the\n\nrespondents, but against either the solicitor or Raymond Lim. That brings me to the final\n\npoint. When the trial judge dismissed the appellants' claim, their counsel asked for\n\njudgment against Raymond Lim; alternatively, for leave to amend the writ so as to join\n\nRaymond Lim (who was already named as the first Third Party) as a defendant. The\n\napplication was dismissed by the trial judge. Against this dismissal the appellants also\n\nappealed and ask that Raymond Lim be made a defendant should their appeal against the\n\nsubstantive judgment be dismissed. Raymond Lim did not appear at the hearing of this\n\nappeal and it appears that he had also discharged his counsel. In any event, I am of the\n\nview that the trial judge was not wrong in refusing to exercise her discretion to allow\n\nthe writ to be amended by adding Raymond Lim as a defendant. It was far too late for such\n\na major amendment. The appellants ought to have made that application at the start of the\n\ntrial.Verdict11. For the reasons above, I dismiss the appeal. The appellants are\n\nlegally-aided so there will be no order in respect of costs.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
