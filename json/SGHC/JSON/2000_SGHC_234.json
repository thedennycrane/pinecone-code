At the time of offence, he was residing at Block 105, Teck Whye Lane\n\n  #04-490. He is currently unemployed. He was the ex-boyfriend of the victim.2 The victim is Areat Selvamary A/P Joseph F/37 yrs old, FIN:\n\n  F7111235R. At the time of the offence, she was residing at Block 123 Yishun St 11 #10-511.\n\n  She is a Singapore work permit holder, and was working as a security officer for 3M\n\n  Company at the time of the offence.",
        "Facts": "3 The accused and the victim were having an affair with each\n\n  other and were physically intimate with each other at the time of the offence. The accused\n\n  was going through divorce proceedings with his wife and the victim was already married and\n\n  her husband was in Malaysia. The accused did not know that the victim was married until\n\n  sometime in February 2000.4 The accused arranged to meet the victim on 15 February 2000, in order\n\n  that they may have a discussion over their relationship. The accused was upset and jealous\n\n  that the victim was married. He wanted the victim to divorce her husband. The victim\n\n  refused to do so and the purpose of the meeting was to resolve the problem of the\n\n  relationship.5 The accused and the victim met at Chinese Garden MRT station at about\n\n  12 p.m., and then went to Chinese Garden, which is located off Yung Ching Road. While\n\n  walking along the park, both of them walked along a path that led to the reservoir of\n\n  Chinese Garden. The said path was a mud track that was surrounded by thick bushes and\n\n  trees. They then had a dispute about their relationship.6 The accused then assaulted the victim by kicking and punching her.\n\n  The accused punched the victim about 5 to 6 times on her face and also kicked the victim\n\n  about 4 times at the rear part of her head.7 The accused also took out a 15-cm knife that he brought along, to\n\n  slash the face and the neck of the victim. He slashed the face and the neck of the victim\n\n  several times. Investigations reveal that he had brought the knife along to use it on the\n\n  victim if the victim made him angry.8. The accused then left the victim bleeding and lying semiconscious on\n\n  the path and he took the victim’s jewellery, cash and her sling bag with him and left\n\n  Chinese Garden at 1.10 pm. The accused threw the said 15-cm knife and the sling bag into a\n\n  pond on his way out of Chinese Garden. Investigations reveal that he had stolen the\n\n  following items:1) 1 black-coloured \"Puma\" sling bag,2) 1 gold-coloured \"butterfly\" design ring, valued at S$60,3) 1 gold-coloured \"lady head coin\" design ring, valued at S$160,4) 1 gold-coloured \"leaf\" design ring, valued at S$180,5) 1 pair of gold-coloured ear rings with stones on it, valued at $200,6) 1 gold-coloured bracelet with a bell attached, valued at $250,7) 1 gold-coloured pendant with 2 studs attached, valued at $300, and8) cash of $5.The total value of the items stolen is $1155. Investigations reveal\n\n  that the accused had pawned the said jewellery.9 The victim was subsequently discovered at about 3.40 p.m. that day\n\n  when the Police were informed accordingly. She was subsequently found by the Police at\n\n  about 7.10 p.m. The Police found her lying on a clearing on the said path that led to the\n\n  reservoir, some 10 to 15 metres away from the main walking path of Chinese Garden, which\n\n  would not be apparent to any person who would have walked by the area. The victim was seen\n\n  to be bleeding from the mouth with cuts on her neck when she was discovered. She was then\n\n  conveyed to National University Hospital for treatment. The victim went into a coma the\n\n  next day and regained consciousness on 21 February 2000.10. The accused was arrested on 21 February 2000.11. Efforts were made to retrieve the said knife that the accused had\n\n  used to cause hurt to the victim but the said knife could not be found.",
        "Medical Reports": "Your Honour, I have tendered two medical reports to Court.12. Sir, the first medical report dated 20 May 2000 states that the\n\n  victim had suffered multiple lacerations around her neck, chin and right hand. A scan done\n\n  on the head of the victim also revealed that there was an obliteration on the lower part\n\n  of her brain.13. The victim subsequently underwent back hollow depression and\n\n  insertion of external ventricular drain on her head injury. The victim also required a\n\n  surgically created passageway, consisting of plastic tubing and one way valves, implanted\n\n  between a cerebral ventricle and the right atrium of the heart to drain the excess fluid\n\n  from the brain to hydrocephalus. The victim was subsequently discharged from the hospital\n\n  on 27 April 2000.14. The further medical report dated 11 September 2000 states that the\n\n  victim could die from the continued compression of the brainstem caused by the swelling of\n\n  the brain, if she was not operated on. The lacerations on the victim’s neck and face\n\n  would not cause extensive bleeding unless it was continued for a prolonged period of\n\n  time.\"3 I accordingly convicted the Accused of the 2 charges. This was what\n\nhe said in mitigation:\"Your Honour, I am a married man. I have three children. Since the\n\n  date of my arrest, I have not seen my children. My wife betrayed me and she has ran away\n\n  with another man. My children are in Ramakrishna Mission and in welfare homes. Two of my\n\n  daughters are under my custody. I have to take care of them upon my release. At first when\n\n  I started having relationship with the victim, she told me that she was not married.If she had not lied to me in the first instance, I would not have done\n\n  this thing.She has cheated me, your Honour. I have not committed any offence\n\n  previously. I have been working in ST Logistics for 10 years and I have not committed any\n\n  offence. I have not been to prison at all, your Honour. This is my first offence. I regret\n\n  for what I have done. I am sorry. Please be lenient with me, yourHonour.That is all, your Honour.\"4 In addition, the Accused submitted a written mitigation to the court\n\nthrough the Superintendent, Queenstown Remand Prison. This is in the form of a letter and\n\nit reads as follows:\"Your Honour, my name is Chandrasekaran s/o Perianasamy, and I am\n\n  thirty-three years old. At the time of my arrest, I was employed by Singapore Technologies\n\n  (S.T) as a store-man (Armoury Department). I have been working at the above-said S.T. for\n\n  the past ten years and I was drawing a gross income of $1035 at the latest. I am married,\n\n  and it was ten years ago (1990) when I tie the knot and had a traditional marriage. My\n\n  wife bore me three children, the eldest a boy who is 10 years old, second a girl who is 9\n\n  years old, the youngest also a girl of 8 years old. As from 1998 December, I have been\n\n  separated from my wife pending a divorce hearing. Temporarily, my wife has been granted\n\n  custody of my eldest son, and the remaining two younger children have been placed in my\n\n  custody. I livedwith my mother at her place. It is a three-room HDBflat. I\n\n  have been paying my wife a sum of $375 per month prior to my arrest. I also have to bear\n\n  the expenses of my other two children who are in my custody. So, I took up another job as\n\n  a security officer guarding a warehouse in the night to put up with the expenses for both\n\n  sides. It wasn't easy, but I have to see for the best interest of my children. I had to\n\n  make sure they received the best education, love and care. When I was working in the\n\n  night, my mother would stand-in to take care of my children. I would have to rush home to\n\n  prepare them for school and send them as my mother is old and had leg problems for some\n\n  time.Your Honour, sometime in November 1999, I was introduced to the victim\n\n  by a friend of mine named Hassan. I know Hassan from my working place. I called her and we\n\n  agreed to meet each other at Yishun MacDonald's. We chit chatted and got to know each\n\n  other. We spend an hour at the MacDonald's and left to send her to the nearest MRT\n\n  station. I subsequently left for home after that. One week later, she, the Victim, called\n\n  me and told me she wanted to come over my place for a casual visit. I agreed and gave her\n\n  directions to my place. Later, when at my place, I noticed that she was very fond of my\n\n  children and the children also liked her. To be honest, I was in love with her the first\n\n  time I met her at the MacDonald's. I was thinking that it would be a good idea if I could\n\n  manage to convince her of my love towards her and after my divorce, I intended to marry\n\n  her. It was also for the sake of my children and at least they will have both mother and\n\n  father love. I was thinking for the long-term benefit of my two children. I didn't want\n\n  them to grow up not having a mother love which is very important. When I spoke to her\n\n  about my intentions, she was very happy and told me okay. I was very very happy and\n\n  celebrated by bringing the children and her out to a dinner and an amusement park. She\n\n  told me she was single and working as a clerk here. December, January passed and in\n\n  February on the 14thday, as we all know is Valentine's Day, I asked her out to\n\n  dinner. She told me she can't and when asked why, she just said she will explain things to\n\n  me the next day. So, the next day, which also happens to be the unfortunate day when the\n\n  alleged attack took place, I met her at Chinese Garden. There she told me that she was\n\n  married and she had lied to me on several issues. When I asked her why she did that, she\n\n  just told me that, to quote her own words (You don't expect me to marry you and bear the\n\n  burden of raising two small monsters). She was very abusive not only to me, but to my 2\n\n  kids who have not harm or wronged her. All my dreams were shattered just like that in an\n\n  instant.Your Honour, at this stage I assaulted her by slapping her repeatedly.\n\n  When she fell, I kicked her and only then, when I felt a sharp pain at my ankle did I\n\n  remember that I had a knife with me and used it to stab her. I was in rage and at that\n\n  time I didn't care what happens to her or later to me. I was blinded with so much rage and\n\n  hatred for her for abusing my children verbally and my trust. As for the knife, I just\n\n  can't explain what it was doing with me. I will give no excuses for it and will fully bear\n\n  the responsibility of my actions.Your Honour, I am a first offender and I have never have a brush with\n\n  the law prior to this offence. I also want the Court to know that I have also lost my two\n\n  children to my wife. I am all alone now by myself and I urged the Court to have mercy on\n\n  me. I am also prepared to take whatever punishment meted out by Your Honour as I know I\n\n  have to pay for what I have done. But I also hope the Court will have some considerations\n\n  and understand the circumstances which lead me to commit this act.That will be all. Thank you.\"5 In respect of the first charge, the learned Deputy referred me to 2\n\ncases that dealt with offences under section 307(1) of the Penal Code. The first is\n\nCriminal Case 54/1994:P.P. v Banphanuk & Anor, in which the 2 accused persons\n\nwere sentenced by the High Court to 8 years imprisonment. They had pleaded guilty to a\n\ncharge of culpable homicide, but the learned judge amended this to one under section 307\n\nbecause the records of the preliminary inquiry cast doubts as to whether the victim was\n\nnot already dead at the time the offence was committed. However on appeal by the Public\n\nProsecutor, the Court of Appeal held that the charge should not have been reduced because\n\nthe records of the preliminary inquiry are generally not evidence before the court. The\n\nappeal court held that where an accused had made an unqualified plea of guilt and the\n\nstatement of facts to which he admits discloses that the offence is made out, the court\n\nought not to amend the charge unless there are exceptional circumstances. The Court of\n\nAppeal found no such circumstances in that case and reversed the decision of the court\n\nbelow. The appellate court proceeded to convict the accused persons on the charge of\n\nculpable homicide but maintained the 8-year imprisonment term imposed in the court below.6 The second case is Criminal Case 9/1997:PP v Chua Hwa Soon.\n\nThe accused there was a 25 year old sergeant in the Singapore Armed Forces. He was charged\n\nwith the brutal murder of his brother’s wife, a 39 year old housewife. A charge under\n\nsection 307 was also preferred against him in relation to his nephew, the victim’s\n\n4-year old son, whom he had slashed 9 or 10 times with a chopper on the face, head, neck,\n\nboth shoulders, both arms and left leg. His defences on the murder charge of diminished\n\nresponsibility and grave and sudden provocation were rejected by the court. The accused\n\nwas convicted of both charges and sentenced to death on the murder charge and to life\n\nimprisonment on the charge under section 307.7 Although the sentences meted in the cases cited to me were useful\n\nguidelines in determining the appropriate sentence, I had borne in mind that each case\n\nmust be determined on the basis of its unique circumstances. The facts of the present case\n\nwere rather grave. The Accused kicked and punched the victim to such an extent that she\n\nsuffered serious head injuries. Combined with the effect of delayed treatment, this\n\nresulted in her being in a coma for 6 days. Indeed, she was close to death and it is the\n\nAccused’s good fortune that she did not succumb for he would then have faced a murder\n\ncharge instead of one under section 307. In addition to those blunt injuries, the Accused\n\nhad carried a 15 cm knife with him to the meeting. He said that he did so for protection\n\nas he had feared that the victim had informed her husband about him or arranged with other\n\npersons to attack him. In the event nobody else was there to threaten him; yet in addition\n\nto the brutal kicks and punches, he had used the knife to slash the victim, inflicting\n\nmultiple lacerations on her neck, chin and right hand. I noted that the further medical\n\nreport stated that those lacerations would not have caused extensive bleeding unless\n\nuntreated over a prolonged period. In this connection, I noted that the Accused had left\n\nthe victim, who was bleeding and semiconscious, in a bushy area and it was fortuitous for\n\nher as well as for him that she was discovered by a passer-by and eventually brought to\n\nhospital for treatment.8 The victim was a woman who had posed no physical threat to the\n\nAccused. They had been having an affair and on the day of the offence, she had told him\n\nthat she wanted to stop it. Even accepting the Accused’s version that she had heaped\n\ninsults on him and his children, I totally fail to see how this in any way mitigates his\n\nreaction which was violent to the extreme. And at the end of this violence, not only did\n\nhe leave her there in the bushes but he callously took her sling bag containing her cash\n\nand jewellery. He eventually pawned her jewellery for cash. If indeed he was actuated by\n\nan uncontrollable rage when he brutalised her, he had certainly regained control of his\n\nsenses fast enough to have the presence of mind to help himself to her belongings.\n\nFurthermore, he had left her in that state in a discreet location. The circumstances are\n\nsuch as would raise the inference that he had left her to die. This is because if she\n\nsurvived there would be no way that he could escape punishment as she knew his identity.9 As I have said earlier, the circumstances were rather aggravating and\n\nthere was not much that the Accused had submitted by way of mitigating circumstances.\n\nHowever there were 2 factors in his favour. The first was his guilty plea. By doing so he\n\ncould be said to have shown remorse and had spared the victim the further agony of giving\n\nevidence in a trial. Secondly, this was his first offence. Section 307(1) provides, where\n\nhurt is caused, for imprisonment for life or for a term which may extend to 10 years, plus\n\ncaning. If not for the mitigating factors in the present case, I would have had no\n\ncompunction about imposing the maximum term of life imprisonment, such were the\n\naggravating factors.10 In view of the circumstances of the offence and the mitigating\n\nfactors, I sentenced the Accused to 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on\n\nthe charge under section 307(1), and to 1 year imprisonment on the charge under section\n\n379. I ordered the two sentences of imprisonment to run concurrently.Lee Seiu KinJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
