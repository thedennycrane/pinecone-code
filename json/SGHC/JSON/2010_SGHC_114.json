        "The court’s decision": "12     The test as to whether leave should be granted\n                    for judicial review of a decision of a public authority was outlined by the\n                    Court of Appeal inChan Hiang Leng Colin v Minister for\n                        Information and the Arts[1996] 1 SLR(R) 294. In that\n                    case, Karthigesu JA, who delivered the judgment of the Court, said at [25]\n                    that what the applicant has to prove “is not a prima facie case, but a\n                    prima facie case of reasonable suspicion”. Subsequently, inPublic Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda[2001]\n                    1 SLR(R) 133, the Court of Appeal held at [22] that leave\n                    “would be granted if there appears to be a point which might, on further\n                    consideration, turn out to be an arguable case in favour of granting to the\n                    applicant the relief claimed”. 13     Mr Yusoff attacked the decision of the\n                    Syariah Court on 28 December 2008 on the ground that that it was not within\n                    that court’s jurisdiction to re-open the issue of division of matrimonial\n                    property once the first consent order had been made on 28 December 2005. He\n                    also asserted that the final order of the Syariah Court on the division of the\n                    matrimonial property was “totally unfair and wrong”. First consent order was varied by\n                    consent 14     Mr Yusoff has no basis whatsoever for\n                    complaining about the setting aside of the first consent order as that order was\n                    set aside with the consent of both parties on 31 January 2007.\n                    Mr Yusoff was represented by counsel at the material time. 15     A consent order can be set aside on grounds\n                    which would invalidate an agreement between the parties: seeHuddersfield Banking Co Ltd v Henry Lister & Son Limited[1895] 2 Ch 273. It can also be varied or set aside with the consent\n                    of the parties: seeCaptain Rudolf Adrian Joseph v Malaysian\n                        Airline System Bhd & Anor[2008] 5 MLJ 392,Zainuddin bin Muhammad v Atsco Ltd & Anor[2003] 1 MLJ 369 andVisia Finance Bhd v Expert\n                        Credit & Leasing Sdn Bhd & Ors[1998]\n                    2 MLJ 705. There is no reason why these general principles under the\n                    common law would not apply to cases falling within the ambit of AMLA. In fact,\n                    s 52(6) of AMLA provides that the Syariah Court may “vary or rescindanyorder where it is satisfied that the order\n                    was based on any misrepresentation or mistake of fact or where there has been\n                    any material change in the circumstances, or for other good cause being shown to\n                    the satisfaction of the Court”. As effect must be given to the words\n                        “anyorder” in s 52(6),\n                    there is no reason to exclude consent orders from the ambit of\n                    s 52(6). 16     When the first consent order was set aside by\n                    consent on 31 January 2007, the parties specifically agreed that the\n                    dispute regarding the parties’ entitlement to the sale proceeds of the\n                    matrimonial property would be remitted back to the Syariah Court for its\n                    determination. After having accepted the terms of the second consent order,\n                    Mr Yusoff cannot resile from his position merely because the Syariah\n                    Court’s final order on the division of the proceeds from the sale of the\n                    matrimonial property is, in his view, less advantageous to him than the first\n                    consent order. It follows that his application for leave for judicial review\n                    must be dismissed. Whether the Syariah Court\n                        exceeded its jurisdiction 17     The fact that the first consent order was set\n                    aside with the consent of both parties escaped the attention of\n                    Mr Yusoff’s counsel, Mr Peter Pang, who merely argued that the\n                    Syariah Court had no jurisdiction to deal with the matrimonial property after\n                    the first consent order had been made. For the sake of completeness, his\n                    argument will be considered, if only to show that even if the first consent\n                    order had not been set aside by consent, Mr Yusoff’s application for\n                    leave lacked a solid foundation. 18     The relevant part of s 35(2) of AMLA,\n                    which concerns the jurisdiction of the Syariah court, provides as\n                    follows: The Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions and\n                        proceedings in which all the parties are Muslims or where the parties were\n                        married under the provisions of the Muslim law andwhich\n                            involve disputesrelating to — …. (b)divorces known in the Muslim law as fasakh, cerai\n                            taklik, khuluk and talak; … (d)the disposition or division of property on divorce\n                            or nullification of marriage; …. [emphasis added] 19     Section 35(2) of AMLA should be read with\n                    s 52(3) of AMLA, which outlines the powers of the Syariah court and\n                    provides as follows: The Court may, at any stage of the proceedings for divorce or nullity of\n                        marriage or after making a decree or order for divorce or nullity of\n                        marriage, or after any divorce has been registered under section 102 before\n                        1st March 2009, on the application of any party, make such orders as it\n                        thinks fit with respect to — …. (d)the disposition or division of property on divorce\n                            or nullification of marriage. 20     Mr Pang argued that as s 35(2) of\n                    AMLA gives the Syariah Court jurisdiction to deal with “disputes”,\n                    the said court lost its jurisdiction after the first consent order was made\n                    because there was no longer any “dispute” between the parties once\n                    that order had been made. He added in his “Points of Submission”\n                    at (1)(b) that the effect of the decision of the Court of Appeal inMadiah bte Atan v Samsudin bin Surin[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 327 (“Madiah”) is\n                    that “[j]urisdiction over the subject matter pursuant to a settlement\n                    reached by the parties did not lie with the Syariah Court”. This is an\n                    erroneous reading of the decision in that case, which must now be read in the\n                    context of the amendments to AMLA in 1999, which introduced,inter alia, s 52(3) – (6) to empower the Syariah\n                    Court to vary or rescind any order on the grounds specified\n                therein. 21     InMadiah, the\n                    parties’ consensual divorce was registered by a kadi, who had no power to\n                    make any order on the division of the parties matrimonial flat. There was no\n                    “dispute” on the disposition of the flat as the husband had\n                    voluntarily agreed to transfer the flat to the wife. However, he disappeared\n                    before the flat was transferred as he was wanted by the Central Narcotics Bureau\n                    in connection with a drug offence, and the wife sought a declaration from the\n                    High Court that she was the sole beneficiary of the flat. The Court of Appeal\n                    held that the High Court could grant the declaration because an express\n                    pre-condition to the Syariah Court’s jurisdiction under s 35 of AMLA\n                    was the existence of a dispute on the disposition of property on divorce and as\n                    there was no dispute between the parties regarding this matter, s 35 of\n                    AMLA was inapplicable. The rationale for the decision of the Court of Appeal is\n                    thus completely different from that suggested by Mr Pang. 22     In the present case, both Mr Yusoff and\n                    Mdm Umi had a dispute regarding the division of the matrimonial property\n                    upon their divorce in the Syariah Court and that was why they appeared in the\n                    Syariah Court on several occasions in relation to their said dispute. The\n                    Syariah Court’s power under s 52(6) of AMLA to set aside or vary any\n                    orders has been mentioned above at[15]and\n                    would be relevant even if the first consent order had not been set aside by\n                    consent. In my view, once the Syariah Court has jurisdiction in relation to any\n                    dispute regarding the dissolution of a marriage and the division of matrimonial\n                    property, it is entitled to deal with all relevant issues pertaining to these\n                    matters, including disputes regarding the effect of an order and whether or not\n                    there are reasons for setting it aside. When the consent order in the present\n                    case was set aside, the dispute between the parties remained unresolved and the\n                    Syariah Court had jurisdiction to make the final order on the division of the\n                    matrimonial property. 23     It is also pertinent to note that a number of\n                    High Court decisions concerning the variation of consent orders emanating from\n                    the Syariah court do not support Mr Pang’s interpretation of\n                    s 35(2) of AMLA. InHafiani bte Abdul Karim b Mazlan bin\n                        Redzuan[1995] 3 SLR(R) 738, the parties, who were\n                    divorced in the Syariah Court, obtained a consent order from that Court, which\n                    awarded custody of their child to the father. Two years later, the child’s\n                    mother, relying on the Guardianship of Infants Act (Cap 122, 1985 Rev\n                    Ed), applied to the High Court for custody of the child. Kan Ting Chiu J\n                    agreed with the child’s father that the matter should be dealt with by the\n                    Syariah Court. He explained at [16] that where a custody order has been made by\n                    the Syariah Court under AMLA, “the variation of the order should be\n                    decided under the same legal regime of [AMLA] and the Syariah Court rather than\n                    be transposed to the High Court to be decided under the Guardianship of Infants\n                    Act”. 24     Kan J’s approach was adopted by GP\n                    Selvam J inLathibaby Bewvi v Abdul Mustapha[1996] 3 SLR(R) 698. 25     Finally, it ought to be pointed out that\n                    Mr Yusoff’s assertion that the decision of the Syariah Court was\n                    unfair need not be considered as s 56A of AMLA provides that subject to the\n                    Act, a decision of the Syariah Court or the Appeal Board is final and conclusive\n                    and “no decision or order of the Court or the Appeal Board shall be\n                    challenged, appealed against, reviewed, quashed or called into question in any\n                    court and shall not be subject to any Quashing Order, Prohibiting Order,\n                    Mandatory Order or injunction in any court on any account”.",
        "Conclusion": "26     For the reasons stated, Mr Yusoff did not\n                    meet the relatively low threshold for the granting of leave for judicial review.\n                    As such, his application was dismissed."
