        "Prima Facie Case": "8. On the witness’ evidence adduced by the prosecution and on the\n\nadmissions of the Accused as set out in his various police statements which I have set out\n\nearlier I wasprima faciesatisfied that the prosecution had proven that both the\n\nbrown bag (Exh. P63) he carried in the motorlorry YD 8173P and the white plastic\n\nbag (Exh. P85) recovered in the Accused’s bedroom in flat #12-362 had not less\n\nthan 24.47 and 77.40 grams of diamorphine as analyzed and deposed to by Dr Lee the\n\nScientific Officer. Under Chapter S 17 (s) of the Misuse of Drugs Act possession of more\n\nthan 2 grams of diamorphine raised the presumption that the possession of diamorphine was\n\nfor the purpose of trafficking. I was further satisfied that the prosecution hadprima\n\nfacieproved that the above amounts of diamorphine in each case were in the possession\n\nof or control of the Accused. The Accused was seen bringing down the brown bag (Exh.\n\nP63) from his flat #12-362 in which 24.47 grams of diamorphine were found. On his own\n\nadmission in his statement,Exh. P60, he said he brought down the brown bag (Exh.\n\nP63) and thereafter sat in the front passenger cabin and kept the said bag between his\n\nlegs. After his arrest he also admitted that the said brown bag contained diamorphine and\n\nthat he had obtained it from one Ah Mike and that he understood he was given the\n\ndiamorphine to be repacked into the small sachets and thereafter he was to return the\n\nrepacked heroin to the aforesaid Ah Mike for which work he would be paid S$1000.9. The Accused explanation in respect of the 77.40 grams of diamorphine\n\nfound in his bedroom was the same. He explained that he had received the two amounts of\n\ndiamorphine together in the morning of 11 April 2000 and he had separated them i.e.\n\nputting aside the 77.40 grams of diamorphine contained in the white plastic bagExh.\n\nP85(2 transparent plastic packets and 2 envelopes) in between a wardrobe and the\n\ndressing table.10. All these facts went to prove that the Accused had knowledge that\n\nthe contents of the aforesaid two bags concerning each of the charges was diamorphine and\n\nthat he was in control of such diamorphine. It was alsoprima facieproved by his\n\nadmissions when read as a whole that the Accused had such possession for the purpose of\n\ntrafficking as he intended to repackage the diamorphine and had partially repackaged the\n\ndiamorphine and was on his way to deliver some of that diamorphine, the subject matter of\n\nthe 1stCharge as requested by Ah Mike. Drug related paraphernalia was found in\n\nthe flat for repacking of the diamorphine consisting of heat sealing and more than 2,500\n\nempty sachets and a weighing scale including diamorphine stained spoon all indicating that\n\nthe Accused had repackaged diamorphine. Complementing the proof were the presumptions\n\nunder the MDA. Apart from the presumption of S.17 as stated above the presumption in S\n\n5(2) of the MDA stipulated that a person commits the offence of trafficking in a\n\ncontrolled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of trafficking.11. Therefore both on proof and presumption I wasprima faciesatisfied that the Accused was trafficking in the amount of heroin set out in each of the\n\ntwo charges. It was for the Accused to prove otherwise on a balance of probabilities. In\n\nthe circumstances, I called upon him to enter his defence.Defence12. On the Accused defence being called the Accused elected to remain\n\nsilent.Decision13. Counsel for the Defence submitted at the conclusion of the case\n\nthat only a case of possession of drugs was established against the Accused and the\n\nAccused should only be found guilty of the lesser acts of possession in respect of each\n\ncharge. He went on to submit that the actual purpose of possession was repackaging the\n\ndiamorphine in question and for the repackaged diamorphine to be returned to Ah Mike or\n\nhis agent. He submitted that when the MDA referred to the purpose of possession it must be\n\nthe dominant purpose. The dominant purpose was repacking and the secondary purpose was the\n\nreturn of the repackaged drugs to its owner. The Accused would not know what the owner\n\nwould want to do with the repackaged drugs. As such, there was no trafficking by the\n\nAccused.13.1 I found the submission both novel and ingenious. I rejected the\n\nsame. The law was plainly set out in s 5(2) of the MDA and enunciated inSze Siew\n\nLuanP P[1997] 2SLR 522 at 525 in which Yong C J stated as follows:\" It is settled law that possession of drugs for the purpose of\n\n  returning them to the owner is possession for the purpose of trafficking, for the bailee\n\n  would eventually have to transfer possession back to the bailor.\"This was held by the Court of Appeal inLee Yuan Kwang & Ors\n\n  v P P[1995] 2SLR 349 at 368:Adopting the court’s interpretation of ‘deliver’ in Goh\n\n  Hock Huat, he could not succeed in rebutting the presumption of possession of the drugs\n\n  for the purpose of trafficking on the basis of the argument that ‘returning’ the\n\n  drugs to Lee was not trafficking. By a future act which would transfer possession of the\n\n  drugs to Lee, Yakoob would be admitting, in effect, that he would deliver the drugs to\n\n  Lee, albeit at a subsequent time. The fact that this time had not yet arrived was\n\n  immaterial because of s 5(2), the insertion of which was intended to clarify\n\n  Parliament’s intention that once the presumption of trafficking was invoked,\n\n  ‘there was no need to show the overt act of trafficking which he had intended to\n\n  do.\"14. It was clear from the Prosecution’s evidence adduced that by a\n\nfuture act, the Accused would be transferring possession of the repackaged diamorphine to\n\nAh Mike and the Accused was admitting as such that he hadoffered to deliverandwould\n\ndeliversuch diamorphine in respect of each charge to Ah Mike - in respect of the 1stcharge almost immediately and in respect of the other charge subsequently when asked to by\n\nAh Mike. Such an intended delivery of the diamorphine on the part of the Accused evinced\n\nthat the Accused’s intention of having the diamorphine in his possession was for the\n\npurpose of trafficking and the repacking into retail sized sachets of about 8 grams each\n\naccentuated not diminished the purpose. The intended eventual delivery was not of\n\nsecondary significance and inconsequential to trafficking as submitted by Defence Counsel\n\nbut was in my opinion the culminating act of trafficking.15. There was also no further evidence for me to consider that the\n\nAccused was not trafficking in the said amount of diamorphine, the Accused having remained\n\nsilent. I also drew an adverse inference against the Accused upon his refusal to take the\n\nstand under s 196(2)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) which states:\"If the accused after being called upon by the court to give\n\n  evidence or after he or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will\n\n  give evidence, refuses to be sworn or affirmed, the court, in determining whether the\n\n  accused is guilty of the offence charged, may draw such inferences from the refusal as\n\n  appear proper.\"15.1 On a review of the whole evidence, I was satisfied that there was\n\nno contrary indication that the presumption under s 5(2) of the MDA should not apply. The\n\nevidence of the Prosecution not being controverted, I found the Accused had failed to\n\nprove on a balance of probabilities that he did not traffic in the diamorphine in respect\n\nof each of the charges upon which he was tried.16. I therefore found him guilty in respect of each charge and\n\nconvicted him accordingly and sentenced him according to law.Amarjeet SinghJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
