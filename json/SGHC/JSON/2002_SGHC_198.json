Mitco\n\nentered into 137 individual contracts of sale of palm olein, particulars of which are set\n\nout in Schedule I annexed hereto. Two international fraudsters, an American citizen and a\n\nJapanese, deployed the strategy of ‘buying high (from Mitco) and selling low’ a\n\nhuge quantity of palm olein (a derivative of palm oil) with no intention to pay Mitco\n\nanything like the contracted prices. They were assisted by a Taiwanese who caused to be\n\nissued or opened spurious Letters of Credit. Payments, if and when made, were only made to\n\nensure that Mitco would as they did enter into more contracts of sales. They are\n\nrespectively William Lindsay Cannon (\"Cannon\", the 17thdefendant),\n\nShunichi Nonaka (\"Nonaka\", the 3rddefendant) and Tsai Cheng Wen\n\n(\"Tsai\", 23rddefendant). Cannon and Nonaka used Inter-America’s\n\nGroup LLC (\"IAG\", the 15thdefendant) as a corporate vehicle to carry\n\nout the fraud. Tsai was instrumental in opening inoperable letters of credit or fraudulent\n\nletters of credit. He received over US$29 million from the proceeds of sale. I shall refer\n\nto Nonaka, IAG, Cannon, IAG and other companies related to them, and Tsai collectively as\n\n\"the IAG Parties\".2\n\n        As part of the fraud, Nonaka and Cannon bribed\n\nan employee of Mitco, Mohammed Amin Najib (\"Najib\", the 5thdefendant). He was initially Senior Trader and at the crucially relevant period he was the\n\ncovering Manager of a department of Mitco. That was a key post. Having compromised him,\n\nthey were able to obtain deliveries of many shipments of palm olein without having to open\n\nvalid letters of credit to pay for them and, astonishingly, they were also permitted,\n\nwithout any regard for Mitco’s interest, to take deliveries of many shipments of palm\n\nolein without having to pay or securing payment to Mitco for the original bills of lading.\n\nIn effect, millions of drums of palm olein were delivered on credit to a first time\n\ncustomer, instead of parting with documents of title against confirmed negotiable letters\n\nof credit to ensure that payment would be assured and made by a reputable bank. This mode\n\nof payment is basic to any seller of goods in international trade who wants to ensure\n\npayment. Further, at the material times the system of controls within Mitco was lamentally\n\nwanting at nearly all critical points.3\n\n        If the simple decision had been taken that the\n\nbills of lading would not be delivered to the buyer’s agents except against payment\n\nor assurance of payment by a reputable bank, the fraud would have been exposed and\n\nshipments would have been stopped as soon as it was found out that the first letter of\n\ncredit purportedly opened was not good for negotiation and, certainly, when later letters\n\nof credit were found to be suspicious. They were in terms obviously inoperable and were no\n\nguarantee for payment against any tender of valid negotiating documents. Mitco’s risk\n\nmanagement unit was in its embryonic stage and that unit also failed to carry out its\n\nduties to detect the serious failures and weaknesses in the General Merchandise Department\n\n(\"GMD\") of Mitco. On the other hand, it has to be noted that very often a\n\ndishonest and compromised insider can help outside fraudsters to by-pass internal checks\n\nand balances and such scams with insider assistance are very more difficult to detect or\n\nprevent.4\n\n        Mitco at the trial made the claim that its\n\nChief Executive Officer, Azalan Mior Zainadi (\"Azalan\", the 4thdefendant) had also conspired with the fraudsters to defraud Mitco. A great deal of\n\nevidence was led. The question is whether Azalan as one of the principal parties had\n\nconspired with the principal conspirators to cheat Mitco?5\n\n        Further, a large part of the evidence was also\n\nled which related to the roles of certain other defendants who had arranged for the onward\n\nsales of the palm olein to buyers in China and India. The question of fact in this\n\nconnection is whether they were genuine buyers themselves in a series of arm’s length\n\ncommercial transactions and they had on-sold the palm olein to the end buyers in China or\n\nIndia or whether they had conspired with the other fraudsters to cheat Mitco or had\n\ncommitted some equitable wrongs. In relation to these parties, Mitco further assert that\n\nthey had ‘dishonestly assisted’ their employee or employees in breaching their\n\ncontractual and/or fiduciary duties in such a manner and to such an extent that there was\n\ndishonest assistance when analysed under the combined tests as set out inRoyal Brunei\n\nAirlines v Tan[1995] 2 AC 378 and as recently clarified by the majority of the House\n\nof Lords inTwinsectra Limited v Yardley & others[2002] 2 WLR 802.The\n\nlatter speeches were delivered by the Law Lords on 21 March 2002 after parties in this\n\naction had filed with me all their written submissions and at their requests further\n\nsubmissions were filed on the impact ofTwinsectrain the applications of the facts\n\nas found by me on the evidence. In short, who of the other defendants were implicated in\n\nand had rendered the dishonest assistance, which caused the enormous loss to Mitco, is\n\nalso a substantial area of enquiry and adjudication which this judgment has to address.6\n\n        In addition to the IAG Parties and the two high\n\nlevel Executives of Mitco, there were essentially three downstream groups of persons and\n\ntheir related companies who or which had successively dealt with the IAG Parties in the\n\ndisposal of the palm olein. In the end, the basic questions of fact are whether both or\n\neach of the last two groups of persons and their companies had dealt with the IAG Parties,\n\nprincipally Nonaka, bona fide and commercially at arm’s length without notice of the\n\nconspiracy or were they fellow conspirators and/or dishonest accessories.7\n\n        The first party Nonaka came into contact with\n\nwas Tiong Tack Kieng (26thdefendant), a Malaysian business operating out of\n\nKuala Lumpur, Malaysia. He and two Malaysian companies in which he was a director,\n\nExcellead Sdn Bhd (the 24thdefendant) and EP Sdn Bhd (25thdefendant) reached an agreement with Mitco prior to the commencement of the trial. Mitco\n\ndiscontinued their claims against him and his two companies. He gave evidence for Mitco.\n\nHe told the court that he had had dealings with Mitco’s parent, Petronas, in the\n\nlatter’s \"up stream\" business. In mid 1998 he took an interest in possible\n\ntrading opportunities in the palm oil market. Early in this new line of business he came\n\ninto contact through his internet enquiries with Nonaka who described himself as the\n\n\"South East Asia Regional Representative\" of Ecopal Trading Group LLC, United\n\nStates of America (\"Ecopal\", the 19thdefendant). On Nonaka’s\n\nassurances he negotiated as agents of Ecopal to sell 10,000 metric tons of palm olein to\n\nChina Tushu Sunry International Trading Corporation (\"China Tushu\"), a Chinese\n\ncompany based in Beijing which was one of only three or four active companies in China\n\nlicensed to import palm oil and palm olein. The price was US$626 per metric ton\n\n(\"PMT\"). But Nonaka was unable to provide any supplier to meet the commitment\n\ndespite his earlier promises and he requested Tiong Tack Kieng to source for a reliable\n\nsupplier. China Tushu did not open the letter of credit. Eventually, this transaction fell\n\nthrough.8\n\n        That request led Tiong Tack Kieng to make\n\nenquiries in the course of which he came to know that Mitco was also trading in palm oil\n\nand palm olein. Sometime in mid September, 1998 he met Najib for the first time. He\n\narranged a meeting between Nonaka and Najib at Mitco’s office. They explored the\n\nprospect. Nonaka introduced Ecopal and told Najib about their business. Najib made it\n\nclear that Mitco had unlimited access to palm oil and palm olein. Najib referred to market\n\nlevels and he mentioned that he would sell to Nonaka at US$715 PMT. Nonaka, to the\n\nsurprise of Tiong Tack Kieng, readily agreed to buy at that price without any negotiations\n\nwhatsoever. It was US$89 PMT above the price at which Nonaka had agreed to sell to China\n\nTushu. Najib also indicated that payment would be by Letter of Credit (\"LC\").\n\nNonaka said it would not be a problem.9\n\n        In fact, Nonaka could not open the LCs. He\n\nenlisted the help of Tiong Tack Kieng. According to the latter, he came across an\n\nadvertisement for Tsai’s company on the internet which claimed that the company could\n\nprovide LC \"financing\". Tiong Tack Kieng carried out the initial discussions. He\n\nvisited Tsai in Taipeh, Republic of China. Later, Nonaka contacted Tsai direct. They\n\nagreed that Tsai would open the LCs in favour of Mitco in return for\n\n\"commission\". 84 LCs were opened or purportedly opened in respect of the\n\ncontracts of sales between Mitco and IAG. 64 of them contained inoperable terms and\n\nprovided no security for payment by the opening bank. Of the remaining 19 LCs, most of\n\nthem were fraudulent.10\n\n        The next two groups of people and companies may\n\nbe conveniently referred to as \"the Huangpu Parties\" and \"the IAA\n\nParties\" respectively.11\n\n        The Huangpu Parties comprise Huangpu Industrial\n\nHoldings Pte Ltd (\"Huangpu\", the 8thdefendants), Tiong Chiong Hing\n\n(hereafter referred to as \"Mike\", the 9thdefendant) and Fu Rong Hua\n\n(hereinafter referred to as \"Cindy Fu\", the 10thdefendant).12\n\n        The IAA Parties comprise the Interamerica Asia\n\nPte Limited (separately referred to as \"the IAA\" and the first defendants),\n\nInteramerica International Pte Ltd (\"IAA\" and the 2nddefendants),\n\nChoo Siew Lohk (separately referred to as \"Lionel\" and the 6thdefendant) and Wu Mun Wai (separately referred to as \"Jeson\" and the 12thdefendant).13\n\n        I should highlight that initially Lionel and\n\nJeson were in the employ of Huangpu when Huangpu entered into the first 22 contracts to\n\npurchase the palm olein from IAG. The first contract was entered into, as noted earlier,\n\nwith Excellead. The next 21 contracts were directly between Huangpu and IAG. According to\n\nthe Huangpu Parties and the IAA Parties, thereafter the Huangpu Parties, as will be set\n\nout later in this judgment, ceased to have anything to do with any further purchases and\n\nsales of the palm olein. The circumstances under which the IAA Parties under Nonaka took\n\nover from the Huangpu Parties will be elaborated later in this judgment. He (Nonaka) had\n\nrecruited Lionel and Jeson and two of their colleagues to join him in IAA, a company\n\nincorporated in Singapore on 31 March 1999. The new arrangements were agreed by the\n\nHuangpu Parties. Mitco in this action, of course, take a very different view and their\n\ncase is as follows.14\n\n        For the purposes of their claims Mitco, under\n\ntheir primary contention that nearly all the defendants had conspired to defraud, are\n\ntreating everyone and every company within the Huangpu Parties and the IAA Parties as one\n\nand that they together with Nagib and Azalan had combined to defraud Mitco. Mitco have\n\nalso asserted, in the alternative, that these two groups are liable for dishonest\n\nassistance of breach of trust and inducement of breach of contract. They also claim that\n\nthe IAA Parties and Flashy Properties Limited (\"Flashy\", the 27thdefendants), a BVI company incorporated on 5 January 1995 which was beneficially owned\n\nand/or controlled by Lionel Choo, for having knowingly received property transferred in\n\nbreach of trust. As against Flashy, Mitco are also seeking the relief of tracing.15\n\n        On the other hand, the two groups who or which\n\nhad filed their original joint defences, separately mounted the same defences at the\n\ntrial. Basically, they assert that all 137 contracts were bona fide commercial contracts\n\nof purchases of palm olein which were separately entered into and carried out at\n\narm’s length. The Huangpu Parties upon legal advice detached themselves from the IAA\n\nParties and conducted their defences independently, having filed their own defence. Their\n\nrespective roles will be separately addressed in this judgment.16\n\n        I now turn to the circumstances in which Tiong\n\nTack Kieng first met the Huangpu Parties. Huangpu had been revived with a paid up capital\n\nof $1m. For over a year Huangpu had been trading, though it had consummated only a few\n\npalm olein trades. As stated earlier, Jeson was in the employ of Huangpu. In or about mid\n\nNovember 1998 Cindy Fu told Jeson that China Tushu had asked her to enquire about Tiong\n\nTack Kieng’s access to palm olein at highly competitive prices. Jeson telephoned the\n\nlatter and informed him that he understood that his principals were able to sell palm\n\nolein at highly competitive prices and that he had interested buyers. Tiong informed\n\nNonaka. It transpired that Huangpu was interested to buy 3,000 metric tons of palm olein\n\nat the price of US$626 PMT. Tiong Tack Kieng travelled to Singapore on 20 November 1998\n\nand met Jeson, his colleague Lionel, Cindy and Mike Tiong. Tiong TK eventually contracted,\n\nwith the approval of Nonaka, that Excellead could sell the palm olein at US$650 PMT.\n\nNonaka informed Tiong TK that IAG would be the party supplying Excellead. Huangpu caused\n\nRabobank to open the LC. The shipment was loaded on m.v. Technochem on 26 November 1998.\n\nHuangpu had on-sold the consignment to a Chinese entity by the name of Summerwind.17\n\n        Just before Tiong Tack Kieng’s tender of\n\nshipping documents for payment under the Rabobank LC, he met with Nonaka and Cannon, a US\n\ncitizen, was at all material times a Director of IAG. He was anxious to control the way\n\nthe proceeds of sale was to be dealt with. On his direction and with the concurrence of\n\nNonaka he issued to Tiong Tack Kieng written instructions for the distribution of the net\n\nproceeds of the LC totalling US$1,915,747.70. Excellead were paid their profits and their\n\ncommission. Tiong Tack Kieng eventually noticed that Nonaka was bypassing him and had\n\ndealt directly with Huangpu. He was most unhappy.18\n\n        On 1 January 1999 Nonaka informed Tiong Tack\n\nKieng by e-mail that Huangpu was taking over from Excellead. A termination fee of\n\nUS$120,000 was agreed. They parted company and went their separate ways.19\n\n        Following the first contract between IAG and\n\nHuangpu in which Excellead played a role, Huangpu on their own entered into 21 contracts\n\nof sale with IAG: Schedule 2 attached shows the particulars. The total quantity was\n\n69,032,316 metric tons and the total invoice value was US$34,009,294.16: these figures do\n\nnot include the first shipment via m.v. \"Technochem\" as it was sold under the\n\narrangements made by Tiong Tack Kieng on behalf of Excellead. Huangpu in turn on-sold the\n\n69,032,316 metric tons of palm olein to their end-buyers in the People’s Republic of\n\nChina (\"PRC\") for the total invoice of US$35,434,598.19. Huangpu assert that all\n\nthese were bona fide arms length transactions. Huangpu entered into an agreement dated 6\n\nFebruary 1999with IAG and agreed to purchase 20,000 metric tons of palm olein from\n\nIAG each month. In the Memorandum of Understanding, Huangpu would receive a discount of\n\nUS$17 from the agreed price or from IAG\"s selling price.20\n\n        In February 1999 Huangpu defaulted in their\n\npayments to IAG in relation to three shipments which were effected on m.v. \"Spring\n\nGrace\", \"Yang Pu\" and \"Ussuryisk\".21\n\n        Nonaka and Cannon were very dissatisfied and\n\ndecided to exercise control over the disposal of the proceeds of sale paid by the\n\nen-buyers effected through the corresponding LCs. They decided to set up a Singapore\n\noffice. In March, 1999 Nonaka verbally invited Lionel to be the local director of IAA. He\n\nasked Jeson to have the company incorporated. It was incorporated on 31 March 1999 with a\n\npaid-up capital of $500,000. It’s office was at the premises of Huangpu and another\n\ncompany related to Lionel and Jeson. Nonaka agreed with Lionel, Jeson and their two\n\ncolleagues that the terms of the MOU between IAG and Huangpu would apply to them. IAG\n\nwould pay them commission. Lionel and Jeson would each get 40% of the commission whilst\n\ntheir two other colleagues would share the remaining 20% equally.22\n\n        To track down fraudsters and others implicated,\n\na victim usually has to follow the money. Mitco’s investigations traced how the\n\nproceeds of sale of the palm olein were distributed. The proceeds totalled about US$124\n\nmillion which was received in different proportions by the Huangpu Parties and the IAA\n\nParties. Huangpu paid US$3.6 million and IAA paid US$10 million to Mitco. About US$0.8\n\nmillion was paid to Nonaka purportedly as ‘commission’. Mitco assert that US$2\n\nmillion was paid to Mike Tiong and that about US$1.1 million was paid by the IAA Parties\n\nto Flashy. Tsai was paid about US$29.1 million out of the proceeds. Ostensibly the\n\nsubstantial payments were for the procurement of the LCs. There were other payments to\n\nother parties within the loop of the IAG Parties and these will be set out later.",
        "The transactions": "23\n\n        Between November 1998 and June 1999 Mitco had\n\nentered into 123 spot purchase contracts with KD Energy Co Limited (\"KD\") for\n\nthe purchase of palm olein in bulk Malaysian origin. They also entered into 123 spot sale\n\ncontracts with IAG for the sale of the said palm olein under a \"back-to-back\"\n\narrangement. In June, 1999 Mitco had also entered into 14 spot purchase and sale contracts\n\nwith Global Commodities (M) Sdn Bhd (\"Global\") and IAG respectively. According\n\nto the schedules prepared by Mitco’s forensic accountants, Messrs Ernst & Young,\n\nIAG on-sold 69,032,316 MT of the palm olein to Huangpu at a total invoice price of\n\nUS$34,009,294.16. This total does not include the invoice price of the first shipment by\n\nm.v. Technochem which was sold via Excellead. According to the schedules prepared by Ernst\n\n& Young, IAG on-sold 165,529.981 MT of palm olein to IAA at the total invoice price of\n\nUS$73,448,680.00. Huangpu’s purchases, which were less than half those of IA, were\n\nsold only to end-buyers in the PRC. IAA’s end-buyers were in India. If payments had\n\nbeen fully and promptly made to Mitco by IAG in the ordinary course of business, Mitco\n\nwould be assured of making a profit.24\n\n        By late 1999, Mitco had supplied to IAG a total\n\nof 307,023,648 MT of palm olein pursuant to 93 of the 137 sale contracts. The outstanding\n\ninvoice value was US$162,297,004.20. In relation to the 44 outstanding contracts it became\n\nclear to the Board of Directors of Mitco that IAG and to Azalan, and certainly to Najib,\n\nthat IAG were not complying with and were not able to fulfil their contractual\n\ncommitments. Mitco cancelled these contracts. In my judgment they were perfectly entitled\n\nto do so and IAG’s counterclaims against Mitco in connection with these outstanding\n\ncontracts were completely without merits. Of the total tonnage of palm olein supplied by\n\nMitco, Mitco were able to collect payment in respect of 62,931,201 MT directly from the\n\nend-buyers by the process of by-passing IAG. These payments are here referred to as\n\n\"the By-pass Payments\". Further, Mitco were able to collect payment in respect\n\nof 9,582,068 MT on a \"Cash Against Documents\" basis.25\n\n        Najib played a key role in Mitco in respect of\n\nthe purchase and sale contracts. He was a very experienced trader. He was a Manager within\n\nGMD and from 11 February 1999 he was the covering Senior Manager of GMD. He personally\n\nnegotiated the terms of the contracts and agreed to them on behalf of Mitco. He knew\n\nNonaka from 1997 and had described the latter as his \"old buddy\" to a colleague\n\nin the GMD. He signed all 131 out of the 137 sale contracts and witnessed the initial\n\nones. He also signed 121 out of the 123 KD Energy purchase contracts on behalf of Mitco.\n\nIn addition, he confirmed all 14 of the Global purchase contracts on behalf of Mitco. On\n\nthe evidence of his colleagues within GMD, I find that he generally handled all the\n\nnegotiations with KD and with Nonaka acting for IAG. He kept a tight control over the\n\ndocumentation and he directed the operations and procedures in respect of the purchases\n\nand sales of palm olein .26\n\n        His colleagues within the GMD and in Finance\n\nand Administration Department (\"FAD\") had raised with Najib on a number of\n\noccasions their concerns about the inoperable terms stipulated in the LCs. But Najib told\n\nthem not to worry because IAG would make payment by telegraphic transfers\n\n(\"TT\"). This action of Najib was utterly beyond his mandate and authority and it\n\ncost Mitco dearly. He had no authority to deliver any palm olein without ensuring that\n\npayment to Mitco was assured beyond question. He misled his colleagues by falsely\n\nrepresenting that he had discussed the matter with Azalan. Azalan entrusted Nazib in the\n\npalm olein sales, which were within the marketing objectives of Mitco, and most\n\nunfortunately for him he took the latter’s word, which proved to be a litany of lies.\n\nI do not agree at all that these lapses of Azalan, however unfortunate, taken together\n\nwere consistent only with deliberate dishonesty. Azalan was ambitious and he tried his\n\nbest, amongst his multifarious duties, to earn the confirmation of his acting appointment\n\nas the Chief Executive Officer by achieving impressive performance by Mitco. In trusting\n\nNazib, which was not at all unreasonable, he was let down. But that mis-judgment, which\n\noften happens in the real world, is certainly not dishonesty, or even a manifestation of\n\ntoo trusting a nature. The events happened within a relatively short period of time. He\n\nhad assumed, though wrongly as it turned out, that the LCs were duly in place even if 90\n\ndays’ credit was given, that the payment of each Mitco’s sale was fully secured.\n\nUnbeknown to him, until it was too late, Najib who was suborned had betrayed him and some\n\nof his colleagues in GMD and FAD, prominently Abu Bakar Salleh (\"Bakar\", one\n\ntime Senior Manager of GMD in Mitco), had let him down.27\n\n        Najib’s involvement in the first sale\n\ncontract incriminate him. He was involved in various communications relating to the first\n\ncontract. He instructed his colleague in GMD to process the transaction. He signed the\n\nproforma invoice to Ecopal Inc, the 20thdefendant which filed a defence and\n\nwhich is a limited company registered in the State of Texas. Cannon was President of\n\nEcopal Inc. He arranged for Bakar to sign the contract. He signed as a witness of the\n\nfirst contract. The first contract, which was shipped by m.v. Technochem, was finalised in\n\nmid-September 1998. The price was US$715 PMT. Though the term requiring the buyers to\n\ntender at sight LC, Najib agreed to a 90 day LC. The amended version was only signed again\n\nlater. Yet the price remained at US$715 PMT. In cross examination he offered the lame\n\nexcuse that it was a typing error and further that prices had dropped and that the\n\nadditional financing costs were absorbed in the said price. It was not. The calculations\n\nwere back-dated and Najib misled Azalan into counter-signing on the calculations. The IAG\n\nParties made payment for the shipment on 3 March 1999 and it was done so that more\n\ncontracts could be entered into without anybody raising any issue about them.28\n\n        Najib was also plainly implicated by his\n\nconduct in the second contract for sale to the IAG Parties. Though he settled the terms,\n\nhe never ensured that the LC was duly opened. Worse, on 5 February 1999 he even released\n\nthe shipping documents after the palm olein was loaded on board m.v. Chem Challenger to\n\nNonaka without a valid LC in place. On the day he released those shipping documents,\n\nNonaka had not even issued a valid LC for the palm olein under the first contract. He also\n\nknew that Nonaka had failed to open the LC and was obviously not keeping his word. I am\n\ncompelled to find the document, purporting to indicate that Bakar had authorised the\n\nrelease of the shipping documents, was fabricated. Since Najib was the only one who had\n\nthe motivation, the opportunity and knowledge of the necessary facts to fabricate it, I am\n\nalso compelled to find that Najib was responsible for it.29\n\n        In terms of compliance with the limits of\n\nauthority in force within Mitco, the first 6 contracts of sale, one signed by Bakar and 5\n\nby Azalan, were not found to have run foul of those limits of authority. Of the 5 spot\n\nsale contracts 4 were signed in January 1999 and one was signed in February 1999. After\n\nNajib was appointed by Azalan as covering Senior Manager of GMD with effect from 11\n\nFebruary 1999, Najib signed the remaining 131 ‘spot’ sale contracts. If valid\n\nLCs covering each contract had been opened in time, those contracts would have been\n\nproperly described as ‘back-to-back’ spot contracts and Mitco would not have\n\nbeen exposed to any risks. I accept Azalan’s explanation that he thought at all\n\nmaterial times that Najib had protected the position of Mitco and that all valid LCs were\n\nin place. That was why he thought Mitco under his leadership was doing rather well and\n\nthere was no need to obtain any approval from Mitco’s Board. Each of the 137\n\ntransactions was, he thought, fully covered by an LC and each of them was not a\n\n‘term’ transaction involving more than one year or RM$75 million, which\n\naccording to the internal rules of Mitco, would have required Board’s approval.30\n\n        Under their internal rules, GMD’s Senior\n\nManager or covering Senior Manager was required to issue Purchase Orders in respect of FOB\n\npurchases such as those entered into with KD Energy. In the context of the transactions\n\nunder consideration in this case these were \"Loading Instructions\" to KD Energy.\n\nSuch Loading Instructions confer on KD Energy authorisation for loading. They should\n\ntherefore only be issued after GMD’s receipt of acceptable LCs. FAD were to verify\n\nthe acceptability of the LCs and have them authenticated by the confirming banks in Kuala\n\nLumpur. Under the spot contracts with the IAG or the related party the buyers were\n\nrequired to ensure that Mitco receive the LCs no later than 10 days prior to loading.31\n\n        In relation to the first 16 spot purchases by\n\nMitco from KD Energy, during the period from 20 November 1998 and 13 March 1999, Najib\n\nissued the Loading Instructions. In his \"Stock Position/Vessel Nomination\"\n\nadvice which detailed the names of the suppliers, quantities to be loaded, loading ports\n\nand loading laycans, he specified his instructions to KD Energy after he had concluded\n\nspot sale contracts with IAG and after IAG had given him the loading particulars. However,\n\nfor 3 shipments on 4 February, 1999 and 82 other shipments beginning from 20 March 1999\n\nloading instructions ceased to be issued by Najib. They were instead, most unusually,\n\nissued directly by Huangpu, purportedly as agent of IAG, directly to KD Energy who acted\n\non them after Najib confirmed that it was quite in order for KD Energy to accept and act\n\non those instructions.32\n\n        In fact, 84 LCs were opened or purportedly\n\nopened in respect of the spot sales. They were inoperable in as much as Mitco were or\n\nwould be unable to tender the required documents and negotiate them. These are set out in\n\nthe first part of Schedule 4 of the Amended Statement of Claim. It will be instructive in\n\na number of ways to take as an example the LCs opened for the first spot sale contract. On\n\nor about 16 November 1998 three irrevocable letters of credit were issued by FIBI Bank\n\n(Switzerland) Ltd in favour of Mitco (\"the FIBI LCs\"). One of the conditions was\n\nthat a survey certificate was required and it was further stipulated in the FIBI LCs that\"The\n\nname of the surveyor shall be confirmed to the beneficiary through advising bank by\n\nopening bank by authenticated swift/cable which must be essential document for\n\nnegotiation…\".Plainly the FIBI LCs were not assured credits unless the\n\naccountee of those LCs gave the instructions to the opening bank and the opening bank is\n\nwilling to make the confirmation. As it transpired, Bacharuddin Abrifin\n\n(\"Bacharuddin\"), a Senior Executive of the FAD’s Trade Finance Section,\n\nattempted to negotiate the LC for the first shipment on 25 November 1998 under one of the\n\nFIBI LCs for 3,000 MT of palm olein. But FIBI Bank (Switzerland) Ltd noted that the\n\nsurveyor was not confirmed by the issuing bank, the cable/telex reconfirmation of\n\nsurveyor’s name was not presented, the survey certificate was not presented and there\n\nwere alternations on the Bill of Lading which were not approved. Because of the\n\ndiscrepancies, the negotiation failed and Bacharuddin alerted Najib, followed by an email\n\non 4 February 1999 to his superior, the Senior Manager of FAD, Abdul Talib Baba\n\n(\"Talib\") and a colleague. On 8 February 1999 Mitco by fax informed IAG (in\n\neffect Nonaka) and IAG on the same day asked Najib by fax for Mitco’s account number\n\nfor payment by Telegraphic Transfer.33\n\n        On the evidence, Najib did receive bribes from\n\nNonaka and Cannon. They were made from the proceeds of sale by IAG on their instructions.\n\nBetween April 1998 and April 2000, he received at least about US$1.2 million, most of\n\nwhich were deposited into his Kuala Lumpur bank accounts in cash. His explanations that\n\nthey came from commissions earned in respect of a financing deal with a party in Thailand\n\nis totally incredible. His claim that an investment of his in Prudential of MR$1 million\n\ncame from his brother was not corroborated at the trial before me, although he had ample\n\nopportunities to do so. He failed to provide any documentation to support his bare\n\nallegations. He was the beneficial and registered owner of a BMW 532i registered on 16\n\nDecember 1999 and he bought on hire purchase a Isuzu Trooper on 12 May 1999 for which the\n\nmonthly instalment was MR$3,411.11. In addition, his first wife bought another Isuzu\n\nTrooper on 31 May 1999 on hire purchase. His last drawn salary from Mitco was only\n\nMR$4,713.26 net. With two wives and 5 children, it was obvious that he could not have\n\naccumulated by savings all his wealth which were acquired during the period he was dealing\n\nwith the IAG Parties.34\n\n        On 11 February 1999 Mitco informed IAG its bank\n\naccount number. The payment under the first spot sale contract was effected by TT, instead\n\nof by LC. Most unfortunately, this first transaction set the practice for the rest of the\n\ntransactions in respect of the mode of payment. Najib had absolutely no authority to have\n\nagreed to this fundamental variation. Curiously, Bakar re-signed the amended contract in\n\nMarch 1999. There was, however, no evidence which show that Azalan at all material times\n\nwas aware of the variation and that he had condoned it. I am satisfied that he was unaware\n\nand therefore there was no question of any condoning by him. Such an arrangement meant\n\nthat IAG was given the credit for at least the 90 days. It left Mitco exposed. Najib was\n\nbribed and he believed on the slenderest assurances of the fraudsters, and in particular\n\nNonaka, that IAG would pay fully by TT on due dates. In my judgment, Najib was blinded by\n\nthe bribes and he did not care if Mitco were not paid. However, I did not think that he\n\nhad at that time realised the extent Mitco would be defrauded. If so, he was such a\n\ndishonest but shrewd person that I had no doubt that he would have insisted on a bigger\n\nshare of the spoils.",
        "The Huangpu Parties": "(a)\n\n        The background35\n\n        I now turn to the Huangpu Parties by setting\n\nout briefly their background. Mike Tiong, a Malaysian, started business in Singapore in\n\n1992. In that year, he and one Sun Zeng (\"Sun\") incorporated Huangpu Holdings\n\nInternational Pte Ltd (\"Huangpu Holdings\", the 14thdefendants). Sun\n\nwas a friend of the father of Mike Tiong. The paid up capital of Huangpu Holdings was\n\n4,310,002 shares of $1 each. It was a subsidiary of a BVI company. He and Sun held the\n\nbeneficial interests in Huangpu Holdings in equal shares, despite the shareholdings. The\n\ncompany was planned to be holding company. Its wholly-owned subsidiary, Huangpu Asia Pte\n\nLtd (\"Huangpu Asia\", the 13thdefendants), was incorporated for the\n\npurpose of taking over the trading activities of Huangpu Holdings. Only 2 shares of $1\n\neach were issued to Huangpu Holdings.36\n\n        While studying in USA, Mike Tiong met Lionel in\n\n1988. Since then, they have been friends. After he graduated Mike Tiong returned to Sibu,\n\nSarawak and worked in the father’s company, Central Cold Storage Sdn Bhd. In 1994\n\nLionel introduced Jeson to him. He also introduced one Tan Tiong Peng aka Thomas and one\n\nChow Wing Hong aka \"Mikey\" to him. In 1995 Mike Tiong invited Lionel, Mikey and\n\nThomas to take up employment in Huangpu Holdings when all three, who did not know anything\n\nabout trading, indicated that they wanted to learn how to trade. Mike Tiong showed them\n\nthe ropes and they assisted him with the trading and the import/export procedures.37\n\n        Huangpu Asia took over the trading of Huangpu.\n\nJeson, who was a remisier, began working for Huangpu Asia in mid-1995. Sun was not willing\n\nto pay Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and Thomas the market rates for traders. They were very poorly\n\npaid. So In early 1996 Mike Tiong permitted them to trade through their own companies\n\nunder the name of the Approach group of companies. In mid-1996 Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and\n\nThomas left the employ of Huangpu Holdings and Huangpu Asia.38\n\n        In early 1995 the businesses of Huangpu\n\nHoldings and Huangpu Asia were thriving. Huangpu Holdings sold all sorts of commodities\n\nincluding wool, copper, crude oil, electronics and electronic parts to the contacts of Sun\n\nin the PRC. The turnover was of the order of US$295 million. Sun did not share the profits\n\nwith Mike Tiong and he asserted total control of both companies. Towards the end of 1996,\n\nMike Tiong lost all interest in the two companies and he transferred his interests in the\n\nBVI parent company, Radwell Holdings Ltd, which had an office in Hong Kong. He resigned\n\nall his managing directorship and all his positions in the two companies. But Sun did not\n\nfile the necessary returns with the Registry of Companies. However, the business of\n\nHuangpu Asia came to a stop in 1998 and it was not disputed by Mitco that Huangpu Holdings\n\nbecame dormant sometime in 1997. Despite the extensive discovery orders against both\n\nHuangpu Asia and Huangpu Holdings, Mitco have not been able to uncover any evidence of any\n\npayment out of the ill-gotten gains to and receipt by both these companies I accept the\n\nsubmission of counsel for the Huangpu Parties that Mitco’s claims against both 13thand 14thdefendants should be dismissed with costs.39\n\n        In late 1996 or early 1997 Mike Tiong met Cindy\n\nFu in Singapore at a party of a mutual friend. They had met in the PRC but only casually.\n\nCindy Fu, a Chinese national and now a citizen of Brazil, is a graduate from the Zheng\n\nZhou University of Grains, PRC and by the time they met, she had vast experience in\n\ntrading commodities. In 1987 she worked as an executive in Quingdao Oils and Grains\n\nDepartment. Over time, he built up her network of contacts, especially people in high\n\npositions in various state-controlled companies licensed to import edible oils into the\n\nPRC. She was not making much headway because she was new in Singapore and did not have\n\ncontacts. Their feelings for each other grew. In the early days, Mike Tiong proposed and\n\nthey teamed up in a new business. He had in mind reviving Huangpu, which he had\n\nincorporated in January 1996, and which had been lying dormant. In the event, he paid for\n\nand took up $500,000 shares in Huangpu at $1 each. Cindy Fu herself invested $499,000.\n\nLionel took up one share. All three became directors of Huangpu. They started trading from\n\ntheir premises at 15 McCallum Street, #11-03, Natwest Centre Singapore with Approach\n\nTechnology Pte Ltd, Approach Asia Pte Ltd and Approach Investments Pte Ltd. All Approach\n\ncompanies were owned by Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and Thomas. All of them eventually took up\n\nemployment with Huangpu.40\n\n        Cindy Fu’s main role was to source for\n\nbuyers in the PRC. Lionel, Jeson, Mickey and Thomas handled the negotiations,\n\ndocumentation and administration. Mike Tiong was involved in making some decisions about\n\nthe first few trades and shipments of Huangpu. He was looking for opportunities to widen\n\ntheir investments in liquor business in the PRC or the owning of palm estate or plantation\n\nin the Riau islands. He and Cindy Fu travelled extensively. Lionel was trusted to handle\n\nthe banking transactions and Mike Tiong signed blank cheques and TT application forms to\n\nfacilitate businesses. In late 1998 their office was moved to 36 Purvis Street, #02-09/10\n\nTalib Centre, Singapore.",
        "(b)\n\n        Huangpu’s business dealings": "(i)         Initial deals41\n\n        Before Huangpu started their deals with IAG,\n\nthey had consummated a few deals. In early February 1998, Cindy Fu put together the sale\n\nof 175 MT of Indonesia dried fishmeal to Sinochem ShangdongYantai Import & Export\n\nCorporation, PRC. Huangpu’s sellers were an Indonesian company and shipment was\n\neffected in April 1998. Tushu China also bought from Huangpu pursuant to two contracts\n\n2,000 MT and 3,000 MT of palm olein. They were shipped out in March 1998. The third palm\n\noil sale contract was to the China Grains & Oils Group Corporation (\"China Grains\n\n& Oil\"). Huangpu sold 3,000MT of palm olein, which they had contracted to buy\n\nfrom Raffles International Co Ltd (\"Raffles\"). Raffles in turn had bought this\n\nlot from Sigtronics Marine Pte Ltd (\"Sigtronics\") in favour of whom, at the\n\nrequest of Raffles, Huangpu opened an LC for US$2.16 million. Huangpu’s 4thpalm olein sale was with Gardner Smith (SEA) Ltd for 1,500 MT of palm olein. On the\n\nevidence, the palm olein, which were under the 3rdand 4thcontracts\n\nof Huangpu, were shipped on m.v. \"Ibuki\" in December 1998. The 5thpalm olein sale contract of Huangpu was entered into with Poh Guan Ho Investment Pte Ltd\n\nthrough Summerwind. Huangpu bought the goods from Kong Hoo (Pte) Ltd. The goods were\n\nshipped on board m.v. \"Changi\". In addition, Huangpu also sold other commodities\n\nsuch as soya bean oil, rapeseed oil, fishmeal and aluminum ingots. Cindy Fu procured most\n\nof these deals for Huangpu.42\n\n        From the abovementioned 5 trades, the m.v.\n\nIbuki shipment resulted in massive losses for Huangpu. Huangpu in October/November 1998\n\npurchased 3,000 MT of palm olein from Raffles and another 1,500 MT (in drums) from\n\nSigtronics. Huangpu, as stated earlier, on sold the 3,000 MT to China Grains & Oils\n\nand the 1,500 MT of palm olein to Garner Smith. On the instructions of Raffles, both LCs\n\nwere established in favour of Sigtronics. Sigtronics chartered a vessel named m.v.\n\n\"Ibuki\". The palm olein were loaded at Pasir Gudang, West Malaysia. The shipping\n\ndocuments were presented to Huangpu’s, Rabobank for negotiations. Rabobank on 9\n\nDecember 1998 paid US$2.159 million to Sigtronics under the letter of credit. The vessel\n\ndisappeared en route to the PRC and did not arrive at the port of discharge. Initially,\n\nHuangpu was told that the vessel encountered bad weather and that caused the delay. Later,\n\nthe news on 28 December 1998 and then on 5 January 1999 were that the vessel had engine\n\ntrouble and was waiting for spares to be delivered to the vessel. Huangpu’s\n\nsolicitors, Messrs Rajah & Tann sometime after 14 January 1999 advised that the vessel\n\nthat loaded the palm olein at Pasir Gudang was another ship masquerading as m.v.\n\n\"Ibuki\". As a result, the Chinese buyers refused to pay Huangpu for the cargo.\n\nInstead, Huangpu had to compensate the buyers for their losses. On top of that Rabobank\n\nsecured Lionel’s signature authorising the bank to deduct amounts standing in\n\nHuangpu’s account to repay the advances made by the bank for the\n\nm.v.\"Ibuki\" shipment.",
        "(ii) Huangpu’s deals with IAG": "43\n\n        In what has been described as an\n\n\"all-embracing\" allegations of conspiracy to defraud which Mitco have asserted\n\nagainst, inter alia, the Huangpu Parties, they relied on 22 contracts entered into by\n\nHuangpu, one with Excellead and the remaining 21 contracts with IAG directly. On 21\n\nNovember 1998, after Tiong Tack Kieng had met the Huangpu Parties as described in the\n\nIntroduction of this judgment, he sent a contract of sale and purchase between Excellead\n\nand Huangpu for 3,000MT of palm olein at the price of US$650 PMT FOB basis. Tiong Tack\n\nKieng was very keen to break into the PRC market and offered by way of inducement a price\n\nwhich was US$15 PMT below the market price. Excellead in turn had a much bigger discount\n\nfrom IAG. Nonaka had instructed Tiong Tack Kieng to offer to Huangpu the palm olein at\n\nUS$626 PMT. At that unit price the overall price would have been US$1,878,000. Armed with\n\nthis privileged information, Tiong Tack Kieng negotiated with the Huangpu Parties and he\n\ngathered the distinct impression that the latter were prepared to pay a price higher than\n\nUS$650 PMT. His company contracted with Huangpu at that price. In turn, Nonaka caused IAG\n\nto enter into the contract to sell the same quantity of palm olein to Excellead at US$626\n\nPMT. It is noteworthy that the evidence adduced in this trial revealed that Tiong Tack\n\nKieng was the only one, and no party from Huangpu Parties, knew that the IAG Parties were\n\nselling the palm olein at a significantly lower price. Tiong Tack Kieng was told by Nonaka\n\nthat Cannon had a \"buy high sell low\" strategy making it viable through\n\nreturns from their High Yield Investment Programs.44\n\n        On or about 10 December 1998 Nonaka visited\n\nHuangpu’s office at Natwest Centre. Jeson introduced him to Lionel and said that\n\nNonaka was Excellead’s supplier. They had a short discussion. Cindy Fu was present\n\nbut she did not take part in the discussion. Lionel and Jeson showed Nonaka an LC from\n\nChina Grains & Oils for 5,000 MT of soya bean oil to be shipped to China in January\n\n1999 and they asked him if he could supply. A contract was signed between Huangpu and\n\nExcellead. Nonaka nominated a vessel, which Jeson could not locate. Nonaka nominated\n\nanother vessel but Huangpu concluded that it could not deliver the goods in time. Huangpu\n\nthrough Cindy Fu secured another supplier.45\n\n        In December 1999 Jeson negotiated with Nonaka\n\nwho offered Huangpu a discount of US$17 PMT. Later this understanding was formalised.\n\nSometime in early February, 1999 Nonaka and Cannon visited Huangpu’s office. They\n\ninformed the Huangpu Parties that IAG could continue to give Huangpu a US$17 discount.\n\nHuangpu would have to sell a minimum of 20,000 MT of palm olein per month. Mike Tiong\n\ndiscussed the matter with Cindy Fu, Lionel and Jeson and in view of Cindy Fu’s\n\nnetwork in the PRC they decided that it was possible for Huangpu to sell that quantity to\n\nbuyers in the PRC each month. Accordingly, a Memoradum of Understanding dated 6 February\n\n1999 with IAG was signed. It should be pointed out that under the MOU Huangpu was not\n\nobliged to sell 20,000 MT per month with a US$17 PMT discount unless the price was\n\nmutually agreed. The final price, under the MOU, was contemplated to be agreed 2 days\n\nprior to the ex tank transfer, i.e. title transfer of the palm olein.46\n\n        It is beyond dispute that Huangpu’s\n\npurchase of palm olein from Excellead, which was shipped by m.v. \"Technochem\"\n\nwas not within the conspiracy alleged by Mitco. I will now describe the 21 transactions\n\ndirectly between Huangpu and IAG. These were evidently ‘back to back\n\ntransactions’ in which, either within a relatively short time of Huangpu selling to\n\nSummerwind for end-buyers in the PRC, Huangpu would buy from IAG or vice versa. In all\n\ncases, and on the evidence of Cindy Fu, the sequence was that Summerwind or an end-buyer\n\nwould contact her first to buy palm olein at an indicative price. Jeson or Lionel would\n\nthereafter contact IAG to inform Nonaka that Huangpu has an end-buyer. To be sure, in\n\ntrades of this nature a lesser price would be discussed. IAG would then decide whether or\n\nnot to sell to Huangpu. The US$17 PMT between IAG and Huangpu was taken off the final\n\nprice. Under the MOU, as noted above, if there was no agreement on the price within 2\n\ndays, there would be no sale. Mike Tiong had engaged in similar, though not exactly the\n\nsame, method of arriving at the price in his sale of air-conditioner compressors in the\n\nPRC. Huangpu’s prices to the end-buyers in the PRC were not necessarily cheaper than\n\nother sellers to the Chinese market. She denied that Huangpu gave bribes to the employees\n\nof Tushu China, though she admitted quite candidly that she had to make ‘guanxi\n\npayments’ which were made to ensure that the transactions went through smoothly but\n\nthey were not made to harm the ultimate interests of the end-buyers.47\n\n        On 7 December 1998 IAG contracted to sell 2,000\n\nMT +/-2% palm olein to Huangpu at US$609 PMT FOB Malaysia. Huangpu’s sale contract\n\nwith Summerwind was also about the same time. Rabobank on instructions of Summerwind on 15\n\nJanuary 1999 issued a letter of credit for the shipment. The latest shipment date was\n\nstated in the LC as 21 January 1999. Summerwind nominated m.v. \"Chem\n\nChallenger\", which was the next shipment by IAG. The next shipment was by m.v.\n\n\"Spring Grace\" under the contract of sale between Huangpu and IAG dated 4\n\nJanuary 1999. The loading on m.v. \"Chem Challenger\" was delayed and it was the\n\ndisclosure that Mitco were the suppliers that Summerwind agreed to wait. There were faxes\n\nabout the possibilities of cancellation of the contract and the payment of demurrage at\n\nthe rate of US$5,000 a day. Najib sent a Mitco fax dated 21 January 1999 confirming\n\nloading the next day \"upon full formalities are in good order\". Jeson found this\n\npart of the fax rather vague and he directly telephoned Najib who declined to elaborate.\n\nJeson in evidence told the court that Nonaka was very annoyed upon learning that Jeson had\n\ncontacted Najib. He reprimanded Jeson and followed up with a written warning against any\n\nrepetition in the \"break through the purchase/sales channels\". The suggestion\n\nmade on behalf of Mitco that the paper trail of the faxes and documents retrieved from\n\ntheir files were part and parcel of the plan to provide a smokescreen to mask the\n\nconspiracy is in my judgment on the evidence bizarre.48\n\n        On the evidence it was clear that Mitco through\n\nNajib did not in fact agree to sell palm olein to IAG until 25 January 1999. It should be\n\nnoted that Mitco’s proforma invoice of 27 November 1998 was for 10,000 MT which the\n\n2,000 MT parcel, eventually shipped on m.v. \"Chem Challenger\" parcel, was a part\n\nshipment. Najib was waiting for IAG through Nonaka opening the LC as promised. However,\n\nNonaka had on two occasions requested Najib to keep Huangpu in the dark about changes in\n\nthe port of loading. In the end, Mitco through Najib agreed to load the palm olein on m.v.\n\n\"Chem Challenger\" after learning that the LC was with Maybank.49\n\n        Although the LCs for the first 3 shipments were\n\nreceived by Mitco, it was also established in evidence that they were not in order. Hasman\n\nHassan, a trading executive of Mitco who reported to Najib and who was working at Pasir\n\nGudang, told the court that he had informed Najib that the LC was not in order. But Najib\n\nfalsely told him that he had been given the green light by Azalan. IAG in the end paid for\n\nthe shipment on m.v. \"Chem Challenger\" by TT on 23 April 1999 before the due\n\ndate. In fact, Najib had agreed, without any authority, with Nonaka that IAG could pay for\n\nthe goods by TT 90 days after shipment.50\n\n        In late February 1999 after Huangpu had\n\ncollected the shipping documents for the shipments on board m.v. \"Chem\n\nChallenger\" and m.v. \"Spring Grace\", Lionel presented them to Rabobank for\n\nnegotiation on the letter of credit. Instead of remitting the funds to IAG upon receipt of\n\nthe sales proceeds, Rabobank set-off the proceeds to cover the credit line that had been\n\nextended to Huangpu for the shipment on board m.v. \"Ibuki\". The sum of\n\nUS$2,159,935.20 was deducted. The third shipment on m.v. \"Ussuryisk\" also\n\nencountered payment problems. China Tushu, the buyers, neglected to pay Huangpu. Huangpu\n\nfailed to pay IAG for the price of the palm olein and were in default.",
        "Nonaka formed IAA": "51\n\n        Although Huangpu reduced their indebtedness to\n\nUS3.2 million to IAG, Nonaka applied a lot of pressure on Mike Tiong, Cindy Fu, Lionel and\n\nJeson. He finally decided that he had to control the proceeds of sale of the palm olein.\n\nHe visited Singapore on 24 February 1999 and he invited Lionel and Jeson to join him in\n\nhis new company. By 4 March 1999 IAA was fully functioning. Nonaka held 499,999 shares and\n\nrecruited Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and Thomas into IAA. Lionel was appointed resident director\n\nand held 1 share in the company. Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu were going through a very bad\n\npatch. Cindy Fu was pregnant. Their personal relationship was in a turmoil. She suffered\n\ngreat anguish and agony over the birth of a child outside wedlock. Their businesses had\n\ntoo many problems, especially the losses in the m.v. \"Ibuki\" shipment and\n\ndefault of China Grains & Oils over the m.v. \"Urruryisk\" shipment. Their\n\nearlier investments in a winery joint venture in the PRC ended with a stalemate and a loss\n\nof at least US$1m which was paid in June 1998. Mike Tiong planned to buy some palm oil\n\nplantations in the Riau Islands. Huangpu invested under US$500,000 but Mike Tiong’s\n\ncounterpart in Indonesia Michael Gautama did not arrange any purchase by Huangpu. Both in\n\nthe business front and in their personal relationship, Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu underwent\n\ntravail and tribulations. Mike Tiong left for United Kingdom towards the end of March\n\n1999. Cindy Fu met him in London at the beginning of April 1999. After a few days in\n\nLondon they left for Brazil for her to visit her family. They remained in Brazil for about\n\na month after which they returned to London. They intended returning to Singapore in\n\nmid-May 1999 but Cindy Fu, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, was not permitted to\n\nfly. In mid-May they left London and they went to Dublin. They were not in any meaningful\n\nway involved in the affairs and management of Huangpu during this period. They had a rough\n\ntime in Dublin. Lionel, at the request of Mike Tiong, remitted US$23,000 to him to meet\n\nthe expenses. Lionel and Mike Tiong were close friends and they would, as they did, help\n\neach other out when times were bad. It is noteworthy that Mike Tiong had never received\n\nany income and/or commission from Huangpu. It was not suggested that he did except for the\n\ncash deposit of US$2 million to which I will revert later in this judgment when I follow\n\nthe money from the ill-gotten gains.52\n\n        In March 1999 Huangpu had very few contracts\n\nand the tonnage of palm olein sold was less than 7,000 MT. Nonaka after the defaults\n\nobviously did not wish to book too many contracts under Huangpu. From April 1999 the\n\ntonnage increased significantly. In the new set-up, Huangpu was still in business. It was\n\nmanaged collectively by Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and Thomas. They also operated IAA but it was\n\nunder the direct control and supervision of Nonaka. Whatever net commission was earned\n\nfrom those deals were shared among Lionel, Jeson, Mikey and Thomas in the proportion of\n\n50, 50, 25 and 25 respectively. I have no doubt that both Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu were\n\ntotally out of the picture. Both Huangpu and IAA were required to sell a minimum of 30,000\n\nMT per month. The General Manager of Huangpu’s bankers introduced Lionel and his\n\ncolleagues were introduced to Tropical Oil Products Brokerage Pte Ltd. Tropical had their\n\nmajority deals with buyers in India. As set out in Schedule 2 to this judgment both\n\ncompanies continued to trade with IAG for sales to the PRC and increasingly to buyers in\n\nIndia. By April 1999 Huangpu’s transactions with the PRC slowed down tremendously.\n\nThe PRC Government clamped down on illegal imports and they licensed the imports strictly.\n\nIn addition, Cindy Fu, who was responsible in selling to the buyers in PRC, was out of\n\ntown.",
        "The Frauds Exposed": "53\n\n        On 30 June 1999 Dato Hamzah Bakar, the Chairman\n\nof Mitco learnt that there were invalid LCs in Mitco. He immediately sent for Azalan who\n\ntold him that the sums involved were substantial, that the palm olein in question had been\n\nshipped and that he had been informed of the invalid LCs a few weeks ago. Azalan explained\n\nthat he had not reported the problems to him because he tried to resolve the problems\n\nhimself. Dato Hamzah instructed Azalan to give as much information as possible of the\n\nproblem to the Board of Directors which was to be convened on 1 July 1999. At the Board\n\nmeeting, Azalan was directed to cease all loading and ordered a full investigation. The\n\nInvestigation Team eventually submitted a full report. Disciplinary proceedings, which\n\nwere internal within Mitco, were brought against both Najib and Azalan. The former was\n\ndismissed. Azalan, who was initially downgraded and transferred to a minor post of reduced\n\nimportance, was eventually dismissed as well. Azalan claimed that there was a full and\n\nfinal settlement between Mitco and himself, resulting in his demotions and transfer, and\n\nit was wrongful for Mitco to have gone back on that settlement in launching these claims\n\nagainst him which he had to defend by selling his home to pay the legal fees.54\n\n        In terms of the amount and the destination of\n\nthe distribution of the proceeds of the palm olein there has been no dispute. The dispute\n\nof any importance has to do with the ownership of the US$2 million deposit with the Bank\n\nof Picayunne, Mississippi, USA and standing in the name of John Dhillon doing business as\n\nAquarius Enterprises Group Inc (the 30thdefendant). Richard Abbey of Ernst\n\n& Young, London, UK, followed the money trail. In a thorough investigation, he tracked\n\ndown the dispersal of the proceeds. Apart from the payments to Mitco and IAG, IAA paid out\n\nUS$20.9 million to Tsai. This amounted to 25% of the IAA proceeds. Another US$1 million\n\nwas paid to Flashy which was and is at all material times the BVI company of Lionel.\n\nNonaka received US$0.7 million from IAA. In my judgment and on the evidence, I accept the\n\nevidence of Mike Tiong, Lionel and Choo that the US$2 million were part of the commission\n\nwhich Lionel and Choo had received from IAA and which they had sent to Mike Tiong for\n\ninvestment and it was eventually deposited by Mike Tiong with Dhillon. Lionel told Mike\n\nTiong that it was his family money. As Lionel has been a long standing friend from\n\nUniversity days and as Lionel is from a well-to-do family, there was no reason for Mike\n\nTiong to doubt this. The contemporaneous e-mail exchanges between all parties concerned\n\nare consistent. These exchanges were not at all contrived; they had not expected that\n\nextensive trawling exercises in discovery which Mitco in litigaton in several\n\njurisdictions eventually launched against all parties targeted by them to recover the\n\nlosses. Even Cannon was caught by surprise and was compelled to subject himself to cross\n\nexamination in London. His answers were so incriminating that it is no small wonder that\n\nhe, having filed his defence and his affidavit evidence in chief on his own behalf and on\n\nbehalf of IAG, Ecopal (19thdefendants) and Ecopal Inc (20thdefendants) failed to appear at the trial to exercise his right of defence.55\n\n        Huangpu paid out US$8.2 million to Tsai. That\n\nwas 23% of the proceeds received by Huangpu. They also paid out to Nonaka US$0.5 million\n\n(in cash). At the direction of Nonaka they paid out US$0.7 million to Ryton International,\n\nNg Sing Kong and Schroeder KG. According to the results of the tracing, IAG paid out\n\nUS$1.2 million to Cannon personally, US$2 million to an entity called Bayou, US$2.6\n\nmillion to an entity called Hamre, US$1.4 million to an entity called Ski Free, US$9\n\nmillion to Venture Trading Partners II Ltd, a BVI company, the 28thdefendants,\n\nand US$0.2 million to Nonaka. Out of the sum of US$11.1 million paid to and received by\n\nNonaka out of the proceeds of sale of the palm olein Nonaka paid US$3.2 million to an\n\nentity called Mitsuhishijisho. I am also satisfied that all other payments out of the\n\nproceeds which are pleaded and reported by Abbey are proved, subject to my finding that\n\nMike Tiong does not have any beneficial interest in the US$2 million deposit and that he\n\ndid not know that it came from the ‘commission’ which Lionel and Jeson received\n\nfrom the sales of the palm olein.",
        "Evidence at Trial": "56\n\n        Mitco at the trial adduced the evidence of 20\n\nwitnesses who were led by Dato Hamzah Bakar. Their evidence and the voluminous documentary\n\nevidence, which were burnt into 8 CDs, proved the fraud to a high degree of probability.\n\nThey also prove dishonest assistance and the receipts of the proceeds of sales of the palm\n\nolein. The task is to identify the culprits who took part in the conspiracy, or who\n\ndishonestly assisted and the recipients of the proceeds of sale. Apart from Azalan, Najib,\n\nMike Tiong, Cindy Fu, Lionel, Jeson who appeared and testified, and subjected themselves\n\nto cross examination, the other defendants failed to appear. No affidavit evidence were\n\nfiled by Nonaka, Investpak, Nonakapak, Tsai, VTP and Kimme. The claims against these\n\nabsentee claimants are accordingly allowed.",
        "Mitco’s Conspiracy Claims": "57\n\n        Mitco allege that the ‘Primary\n\nParities’ (as identified) had agreed or combined to do an unlawful act, or do a\n\nlawful act by unlawful means. The primary parties identified are Azalan, Najib, Nonaka,\n\nCannon, Tsai, Mike Tiong, Cindy Fu, Lionel, Jeson, Spears, Lopez, IAG. IAA, IA\n\nInternational, Huangpu, Ecopal, Tiong Tack Kieng, Excellead and EP. The three last-named\n\nparties are no longer defendants, Tiong Tack Kieng having settled with Mitco and he gave\n\nevidence on their behalf as PW17.58In Kuwait Oil Tanker\n\nCompany SAK v Al Bader[2000] 2 All ER (Comm) 271, it was stated as follows:\"A conspiracy to injure by\n\n    unlawful means is actionable where the claimant proves that he has suffered loss or damage\n\n    as a result of unlawful actions taken pursuant to a combination or agreement between the\n\n    defendant and another person or persons to injure him by unlawful means, whether or not it\n\n    is the predominant purpose of the defendant to do so.\"59\n\n        Mitco rely on the overwhelming circumstantial\n\nevidence. Fraud cases of this type rarely leave behind a documentary trail, unless the\n\nconspirators whilst hatching the conspiracy were electronically recorded. But evidence of\n\novert acts and omissions together are available to prove the fact of a conspiratorial\n\ncombination or agreement. In this case, the relevant question to ask is whether any of the\n\ndefendants had joined in to line his pockets at the expense of Mitco.60\n\n        In relation to the primary parties generally,\n\nbut in particular, the Huangpu Parties, Mitco rely on the judgment of Millet J (as he then\n\nwas) on what would amount to dishonest behaviour that would make a person part of the\n\nfraud. InAgip v Jackson[1990] 1 Ch 265, Millet J stated at p295:\"In my judgment, however, it\n\n    is no answer for a man charged with having knowingly assisted in a fraudulent and\n\n    dishonest scheme to say that he thought that it was ‘only’ a breach of exchange\n\n    control, or ‘only’ a case of tax evasion. It is not necessary that he should\n\n    have been aware of the precise nature of the fraud, or even of the identity of its victim.\n\n    A man who consciously assists others by making arrangements which he knows are calculated\n\n    to conceal what is happening from a third party, takes the risk that they are part of a\n\n    fraud practised on that party...[the defendants] never made nay enquiries of the\n\n    plaintiffs or took any steps to satisfy themselves that the arrangements had the\n\n    plaintiffs’ knowledge and approval...I am led to the conclusion that [the defendants]\n\n    were at best indifferent to the possibility of fraud. They made no inquiries of the\n\n    plaintiffs because they thought that it was none of their business. That is not honest\n\n    behaviour...In my judgment it is quite enough to make them liable as constructive\n\n    trustees.\"61\n\n        The following passage on p293 bears reminder:\"If a man does not draw the\n\n    obvious inference or make the obvious inquiries, the question is why not? If it is\n\n    because, however foolishly, he did not suspect wrongdoing or, having suspected it, had his\n\n    suspicions allayed, however reasonably, that is one thing. But if he did suspect\n\n    wrongdoing yet failed to make inquiries because ‘he did not want to know’...or\n\n    because he regarded it as ‘none of his business’...that is quite another. Such\n\n    conduct is dishonest, and those who are guilty of it cannot complain if, for the purpose\n\n    of civil liability, they are treated as if they had actual knowledge.\"62\n\n        On the evidence, I am satisfied that they prove\n\npersuasively to a high degree and I find that Najib, Nonaka, Cannon and the IAG Parties\n\nhad combined to defraud Mitco in the transactions. They caused Mitco the losses as\n\nclaimed. Najib broke the internal procedures at critical points. Being such an experienced\n\ntrader, I could not accept that he did not know that the FIBI Bank LC was defective and\n\ninoperable. Yet he made a song and dance about this LC, kissing it flamboyantly as if to\n\nlull everybody into a false sense of security. He should have protected Mitco’s\n\ninterest from the start. Yet he deceived his colleagues and betrayed the trust and\n\nconfidence which his CEO Azalan had reposed in him. His actions ruined the life and\n\nprospects of an innocent but too trusting a man, Azalan, who was far too overworked, if\n\nsomewhat ambitious which is not altogether bad. Otherwise, where is the motive power to\n\nexcel? I scrutinised Azalan when he was on the stand and having considered his evidence\n\nand the passion he felt for Mitco and Petronas, I was utterly convinced that he was\n\ninnocent and was lamentably misled by Najib and let down by the other personnel in both\n\nGMD and FAD. He found out the fraud too late. Tried as he did to salvage the situation,\n\nthe international fraudsters with inside suborned help cynically led him down the garden\n\npath.63\n\n        In addition, I also find that Lionel and Choo\n\nafter they had joined Nonaka in IAA became aware of the fraud. They learnt that the IAG\n\nParties, led by Nonaka and Cannon, had bought at a high price from Mitco and were selling\n\nlow. They were not so naive as to believe that by the so-called High Returns Programs, the\n\nIAG Parties could in the end make a profit. That Nonaka was offering them as individuals\n\nthe high discount of US$17 PMT should have alerted them that something dishonest was\n\npractised against Mitco. Lionel and Jeson were in the thick of arranging the loadings.\n\nThey knew the LCs were not used. Yet they could get their hands at the original shipping\n\ndocuments, including the bills of lading. On top of that, they followed Nonaka’s and\n\nCannon’s instructions to distribute the proceeds of sale in a manner that any honest\n\nbusinessman would ask the question: ‘with all these payments to unknown parties for\n\nundisclosed purposes, how will Mitco be paid?’ When the quantities escalated from\n\nApril 1999 until the bubble burst, they should have known better. They chose to see\n\nnothing, hear nothing and say nothing and they assisted because they stood to gain. That\n\nwas dishonest. They did not appear to me to have dealt with the transactions, after the\n\ndepartures of Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu, with Nonaka and Cannon bona fide and at arm’s\n\nlength. On the contrary, I am satisfied that they were hand in glove with Nonaka because\n\nthey wanted to profit, whatever the means.",
        "Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu": "64\n\n        I now come to address the roles of both Mike\n\nTiong and Cindy Fu. In my judgment, they were not part of the conspiracy to defraud. They\n\nhad met Nonaka for not more than 3 times. Nonaka presented a business opportunity, first\n\nthrough Tiong Tack Kieng and Excellead. Mitco had let off Tiong Tack Kieng. And this\n\ninspite of the fact that Tiong Tack Kieng clearly knew that Nonaka was buying high from\n\nMitco without any bargain and selling low through him and his company, Excellead. In turn,\n\nTiong Tack Kieng could give a US$15 PMT discount to the Huangpu Parties. Mike Tiong and\n\nCindy Fu were actively in business. Both had considerable experience, especially in the\n\nmarket in the PRC.65\n\n        The expert of Mitco, Favre, in his evidence\n\nreferred to a number of oddities in the pricing from KD Energy down the string to Huangpu.\n\nHe compared the prices of KD Energy and IAG with the quoted prices at the relevant period\n\nof the Malaysian Palm Oils Board. Admittedly, they made very interesting reading. But in\n\nthe absence of Mitco claiming against KD Energy and in the absence of any evidence which\n\nremotely suggests that either Mike Tiong or Cindy Fu knew of the prices at which IAG\n\nbought, or even any material to raise any suspicion on their part, I am satisfied that\n\nthey had nothing to do with either of them. They are highly prejudicial evidence but they\n\nhave no probative value on the issue whether they had joined in the conspiracy. Favre\n\npointed out that comparing the market prices with the IAG-HP contracts referred to in\n\nSchedules 1 and 2 of the defence of the Huangpu Parties it was seen that on the average\n\nHuangpu were buying from IAG at a discount to the market of US$47.75. This trend could not\n\nconceivably form any basis for suspecting the Huangpu Parties. Cindy Fu obtained his\n\nrequisitions and indicative prices from the buyers in the PRC. With her information,\n\nLionel on behalf of Huangpu reverted to Nonaka. Nonaka on behalf of IAG would sell so long\n\nas he could dispose of the ill-gotten palm olein, as he had no intention to pay for them\n\nwhen the game was up. It would be wholly unjustifiable to attribute to either Mike Tiong\n\nor Cindy Fu any of these ‘oddities’ when they were not responsible for them and\n\nwhen Nonaka for obvious reasons was anxious to dispose of the palm olein, very much like\n\nthe thief anxious to dispose of their tippings over the back of lorries.66\n\n        The more difficult task is to ascertain if Mike\n\nTiong or Cindy Fu were dishonest accessories or either of them was a dishonest accessory.\n\nDid they dishonestly assist the IAG Parties at the expense of Mitco and thereby commit an\n\nequitable wrong within the meaning of the concept set out inRoyal Brunei Airlines v\n\nTan(supra). As foreshadowed earlier, the discussion must involve a consideration ofTwinsectra\n\n(supra). In that case, the House of Lords had to consider the liability of a solicitor\n\nto account to a third party from whom his client had borrowed 1 million. To the\n\nknowledge of the solicitor this sum was lent subject to a stipulation that it be used for\n\nacquiring property (which normally would give rise to a Quistclose trust but that question\n\nis not relevant for our present purposes). The other question was whether the solicitor\n\nhad acted in such a way as to satisfy the requirements of one or both forms of third party\n\nliability which had been labelled for quite a while in cases and in academic writings as\n\n‘knowing receipt’ or ‘knowing assistance’. AfterRoyal Brunei\n\nAirlines Sdn Bhd v Tan (supra)the latter form of third party liability at the\n\nencouragement of Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead has been identified as ‘dishonest\n\nassistance’.67\n\n        And now to the facts in more details.Twinsectra,\n\nthe plaintiffs, lent 1 million to Mr Yardley for his property development business. Mr\n\nYardley’ solicitor, Mr Leach, was joined as a defendant for having dishonestly\n\nassisted in paying out a portion of the 1 million for purposes other than the\n\nacquisition of property in breach of trust. The sum involved was 34,000. Mr Leach knew\n\nthat another solicitor had given an undertaking toTwinsectrathat the 1 million\n\nwas earmarked for the acquisition of property. Another solicitor gave the undertaking toTwinsectrato disburse the money only for that purpose. That solicitor sent the entire loan to Mr\n\nLeach. On Yardley’s instructions, he paid out of the loan the sum of 34,000. The\n\njudge at first instance found that Mr Leach had shut his eyes to the problems or the\n\nimplications of what was happening. Yet he acquitted him of any dishonesty. That Mr Leach\n\ndid assist in the breach of the Quistclose trust was established. However, the question\n\nwhether Mr Leach did so dishonestly proved more difficult. Was the test a\n\nsingle-dimensional reference to the subjective dishonestly or was it a combined test\n\nwhereby the concept of honestly has to be measured by the combined tests of an objective\n\nstandard ‘leavened by a subjective element based upon the characteristics and\n\nknowledge of the defendant’: seeAlistair Speirs[2000] 2 Web JCLI,\n\n‘Caught in the Tangled Web’ and pages pp 105-6 of Tan’s case (supra). The\n\nCourt of Appeal reversed the trial judge and gave judgment against Mr Leach for the\n\nproportion of the loan which had not been applied in the acquisition of property.68\n\n        The House of Lords restored the trial\n\njudge’s decision. By a majority they held that for a person to be liable as an\n\naccessory to a breach of trust he had to have acted dishonestly by the ordinary standards\n\nof reasonable and honest people and have been himself aware that by those standards he was\n\nacting dishonestly. The majority concluded that the trial judge had applied the test, and\n\nhad found that Mr Leach had honestly believed that the undertaking given to the lender was\n\nnot his concern and that, once in his hands, he could treat the loan money as at the free\n\ndisposal of the client. Mr Leach on the evidence had been aware of all the facts and could\n\nnot be said to have been dishonest by deliberately failing to make any enquiries for fear\n\nof finding out something he did not want to know. I should accordingly apply the combined\n\ntests when considering the roles of Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu.69\n\n        There was no evidence which suggested that Mike\n\nTiong or Cindy Fu should have made enquiries. Nonaka offered the supply of palm olein.\n\nCindy Fu’s network of a few licensed buyers in the PRC were looking out for these\n\ngoods. Malaysia palm oil and palm olein were preferred. They entered into contracts of\n\nsale. After meeting Nonaka and Cannon, a Memorandum was later signed. It was an\n\nin-principle agreement and, as described above, once Cindy Fu obtained interest and a\n\nrequest from PRC buyers for an indicative price, of a certain quantity and delivery date,\n\nshe negotiated with IAG through Lionel and parties would fix the price PMT in accordance\n\nwith the MOU. In eminently commercial deals of this sort and size, where the supplier is\n\nof such a stature as Mitco, there was no reason for Mike Tiong or Cindy Fu to suspect\n\nanything. The margin was good. If the profit margins were on the high side, every\n\nbusinessman is entitled to seize the opportunity so long as they have no reason to believe\n\nthat they may be dealing with anything suspiciously dishonest. All the more reason why\n\nquestions or enquiries, which were out of turn and which could be regarded as\n\n‘opening the channels’ in the string of sellers and sub-sellers in breach of\n\nbusiness ethics, had to be avoided.70\n\n        Their first purchase of palm olein for Huangpu\n\nwas from Tiong Tack Kieng. There the gross margin of profit was about US$15 PMT. Of the\n\nnext 21 contracts concluded directly between Huangpu, 10 of them were signed when Mike\n\nTiong and Cindy Fu were in Singapore, but their roles were limited to Cindy Fu’s\n\ncontacts with the PRC buyers. In respect of those 10 contracts, the two of them had other\n\nmatters to occupy their attention. Prominently, they had their personal problems which I\n\nhave referred to. Lionel and Jeson played increasingly important roles. The other 11\n\ncontracts were concluded by Lionel and Jeson, as sales to PRC buyers presented themselves,\n\nand whilst Lionel and Jeson were building up their markets in India.71\n\n        In these circumstances, neither Mike Tiong nor\n\nCindy Fu was in my judgment a dishonest accessory.72\n\n        Counsel for Mitco further submitted that the\n\ncorporate veil should be pierced and that all the acts of conspiracy committed by Huangpu\n\nbut played out by Lionel and Jeson should also be visited upon Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu. I\n\nreject these submissions. When Lionel and Jeson initially carried out the administrative\n\nacts to ensure that shipments were effected and payments collected by Huangpu in respect\n\nof the first 11 contracts, in fact Lionel and Jeson did not know that the IAG Parties had\n\nconspired to defraud Mitco. Unknown to Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu, Lionel and Jeson were\n\nseparately cultivated by Nonaka and over time they were brought into the loop. They\n\neventually learnt what Nonaka was up to but they were looking to line their own pockets,\n\nand over US$4 million were received by them and the two colleagues. When Mike Tiong and\n\nCindy Fu returned to Singapore in August 1999 the true picture became gradually clearer.\n\nBy that time, the fraud had been exposed. Mike Tiong obtained reimbursement of about\n\nUS$100,000 during the period he was away in Europe and South America. There was nothing\n\nwrong in recovering his own money to meet his expenses whilst overseas. In the end, both\n\nMike Tiong and Cindy Fu lost their investments in Huangpu which has become insolvent,\n\nowing more than US$3 million.",
        "Proprietary & Tracing Claims": "73\n\n        Mitco are asserting proprietary and tracing\n\nclaims. In the light of my findings, Najib holds the bribes in his accounts or the\n\nequivalent of those bribes in the form of the vehicles I have mentioned upon constructive\n\ntrusts for Mitco: seeAG v Reid[1994] 1 AC 324 which followed the High Court of\n\nSingapore inSumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahire & Ors[1993] 1 SLR 735andWilliams v Barton[1927] 2 Ch 9. Further, I declare that any of the parties I\n\nhave found liable are holding any traceable proceeds of sale or equivalents thereof upon\n\nconstructive trusts for Mitco. If those trust properties had appreciated and interests\n\nhave been earned, such accretion in value are also held by them upon trusts. I will deem\n\nthem as good fiduciaries who in equity will do what should be done. They hold them for\n\nMitco.74\n\n        On the evidence, I have no hesitation in\n\ndeclaring that the sum of US$9 million paid into the VTP account (prior to the seizure by\n\nthe IRS) and any accrued interest were and are held on trust for Mitco. If any claim to\n\nthose sums are asserted by IAG or Cannon to the return of those monies they are also to be\n\nheld upon trust for Mitco. This sum, in my judgment, came from the proceeds of sale of the\n\npalm olein of Mitco. In the same way, and for the same reasons, the US$2 million deposit\n\nin the Bank of Pecayunne standing in the name of Dhillon trading as Aquarious Enterpresies\n\nGroup Inc and any accrued interest or equivalent of both items are held upon trust for\n\nMitco.75\n\n        I now refer to the condominium in Hawaii\n\npurchased by Nonaka from a ‘loan\" from Investpak. For all purposes, Investpak\n\nand Nonaka are one and the same. It was on the evidence paid for from the proceeds of sale\n\nof the palm olein. It is part of the spoils of his fraud on Mitco. It is allegedly sold.\n\nFurther, Nonaka had transferred what in effect were Mitco’s monies in the sum of\n\nUS$3.2 million to ‘Mitsubishijisho’, a real estate company in Japan. If the\n\nproceeds of sale of the palm olein were used to purchase the property in Tokyo I declare\n\nthat the said property in Tokyo is held upon trust for Mitco entirely or to the extent\n\nMitco’s monies are traceable to that property.76\n\n        Accordingly, there will be judgment and orders\n\nagainst the parties in accordance with this judgment. Mitco are entitled to costs and I\n\naward a certificate of two counsel for the causes Mitco won. Mitco are entitled to a set\n\nof comprehensive orders from this court on the basis of this judgment. They are directed\n\nto furnish a draft to each of the parties affected for their concurrence in writing,\n\nfailing which the same are to be referred to me for further arguments. In respect of\n\nMitco’s claims against Mike Tiong and Cindy Fu they are dismissed with costs. I also\n\naward a certificate of two counsel in favour of both of them. The claims against Huangpu\n\nAsia and Huangpu Holdings are, as I stated earlier, dismissed with costs. Finally,\n\nIAG’s counterclaims against Mitco are of course dismissed with costs. If there are\n\nfurther orders required or if there are any clarifications, any party in these proceedings\n\nis at liberty to apply.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeSingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
