        "Introduction": "1       This is an application by the plaintiff, Power\n                    Knight Pte Ltd (“Power Knight”), pursuant to s 127 of the\n                    Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“LTA”) seeking,inter alia, the removal of two caveats lodged\n                    by the defendants.",
        "Background": "2       The background to this application is not in\n                    dispute. 3       The first defendant, Natural Fuel Pte Ltd\n                    (“the Company”), is a private limited company whose principal\n                    business activities include the sale of solid, liquid and gaseous fuels, and the\n                    manufacture of petrochemical products. 4       On or around 15 April 2008, the Company\n                    entered into two Building Agreements with the Jurong Town Corporation\n                    (“JTC”) in respect of two plots of land on Jurong Island, namely\n                    Private Lots A2173900 and A2173901 (collectively, “the Property”).\n                    Pursuant to the Building Agreements, the Company would be granted 30 year leases\n                    over the Property by JTC once certain conditions were satisfied. In the interim,\n                    the Company was given a licence “as if a lease had actually been\n                    granted” to build and operate,inter alia,\n                    an integrated production facility (consisting of a biodiesel production plant\n                    and a glycerine production plant) on the Property. To date, JTC has not granted\n                    a formal lease over the Property to the Company. 5       By a convertible loan facility dated\n                    24 April 2008, Power Knight granted a loan of US$20 million to Natural Fuel\n                    Limited, the Company’s Australian holding company, the proceeds of which\n                    were in turn advanced to the Company for the construction and maintenance of the\n                    production facility. 6       As security for the loan to Natural Fuel\n                    Limited, the Company executed a Debenture dated 13 May 2008 which granted\n                    Power Knight,inter alia, a fixed charge over all\n                    the Company’s interests in “any freehold or leasehold property or\n                    any other interest in real property including fixtures”. 7       On 9 June 2008, the Debenture was duly\n                    registered in accordance with s 131 of the Companies Act (Cap 50,\n                    2006 Rev Ed) (“the CA”). However, for reasons best known to\n                    it, Power Knight did not contemporaneously lodge a caveat in respect of the\n                    Debenture at the Registry of Titles which it could have done pursuant to\n                    s 115 of the LTA to notify third parties of its interest in the\n                    Property. 8       In early 2009, Natural Fuel Ltd faced financial\n                    difficulties, and was placed under voluntary administration in Australia on\n                    9 April 2009. On 11 September 2009, Power Knight appointed Messrs Chee\n                    Yoh Chuang and Lim Lee Meng as receivers and managers of the company, but\n                    discharged them on 30 September 2009, appointing Messrs Ewe Pang Kooi and\n                    Farooq Ahmad Mann in their stead. 9       Meanwhile, on 28 September 2009, Rotary\n                    Engineering Limited, an unsecured creditor of the Company, filed a winding up\n                    application (CWU 134/2009) against the Company. A winding up order was made by\n                    the High Court against the Company on 23 October 2009, and the second and\n                    third defendants, Messrs Tam Chee Chong and Lim Loo Khoon (“the\n                    Liquidators”), were appointed the joint and several liquidators of the\n                    Company. 10     On 5 November 2009, the Liquidators\n                    lodged Caveat No IB/592668D (“the Liquidators’ Caveat”) in\n                    respect of the Property, claiming: … an interest in the land, for and on behalf of the unsecured\n                        creditors, of the Caveatee [the Company], who are collectively vested with\n                        all the beneficial interests in the land. 11     On 10 November 2009, the Liquidators, on\n                    behalf of the Company, lodged Caveat No IB/598527B (“the\n                    Company’s Caveat”), claiming an estate or interest in the Property\n                    as: … trustee of the interests in the land for the benefit of the\n                        unsecured creditors of the company under a statutory trust arising as a\n                        result of the winding up application filed on 28 September 2009…\n                        and/or the winding up order dated 23 October 2009. 12     Power Knight lodged its own caveat (Caveat No\n                    IB/601038K) as holder of a fixed charge over the Property on 11 November\n                    2009, and commenced this action to demand that the Liquidators and the Company\n                    show cause why their respective caveats should not be removed pursuant to\n                    s 127 of the LTA. It should be noted that it is accepted by Power Knight\n                    that because the Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats were lodged\n                    before Power Knight’s caveat they would, if they protect valid interests\n                    in land, have priority to Power Knight’s caveat (see ss 48 and 49 of\n                    the LTA).",
        "The Parties’ Submissions": "",
        "The Liquidators’ submissions": "13     Counsel for the Liquidators relies primarily\n                    on the authority ofNg Wei Teck Michael and others v\n                        Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd[1998] 1 SLR(R) 778\n                        (“Michael Ng”), a decision of\n                    the Court of Appeal, as establishing that, upon the winding up of a company, a\n                    statutory trust arises to preserve the assets of the company forpari passudistribution among the unsecured creditors,\n                    who are in the nature of acestui que trustwith\n                    beneficial interests extending to all of the company’s property.\n                    Consequently, the unsecured creditors of the Company had the necessary\n                    “interest in land” for the purpose of lodging a caveat under\n                    s 115 of the LTA in respect of the Property. 14     The Liquidators also contend that, on the\n                    authority ofMichael Ng, the subject matter of the\n                    statutory trust includes a company’s encumbered assets, such as assets\n                    subject to a security interest which predates the winding up of the company, and\n                    therefore Power Knight’s fixed charge does not preclude the\n                    Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats.",
        "Power Knight’s submissions": "15     Power Knight counters that the unsecured\n                    creditors of the Company have no caveatable interest, and that therefore the\n                    Liquidators’ and Company’s Caveats should be removed, on the basis\n                    that: (a)     the concept of the statutory trust\n                        has been criticised, particularly by the High Court of\n                    Australia; (b)     the\n                        statutory trust which arises upon the winding up of a company does not\n                        confer beneficial or proprietary interests of any kind on\n                    anyone; (c)     the\n                        statutory trust cannot encompass pre-existing encumbered assets, such as the\n                        Property, which do not form part of the pool of assets available for\n                        distribution among unsecured creditors; and (d)Michael Ngwas\n                        concerned with a different situation and therefore is distinguishable from\n                        the present case.",
        "The Issues": "16     The issues that therefore arise for my\n                    determination are: (a)     whether a statutory trust came into\n                        being upon the winding up of the Company; (b)     if so, what are the interests (if any) of the\n                        Company’s unsecured creditors under the statutory trust, and whether\n                        they qualify as an “interest in land” under s 115 of the\n                        LTA; (c)     whether\n                        the Property fell within the ambit of the statutory trust, which encompasses\n                        assets available for distribution to the Company’s unsecured\n                        creditors, notwithstanding the fixed charge granted to Power\n                    Knight. 17     I will, however, begin with issue (c), because\n                    if the Property does not fall within the Company’s general pool of assets,\n                    it will, on orthodox principles of insolvency law, not be available for\n                    distribution to the unsecured creditors by the Liquidators, and cannot therefore\n                    be included in the statutory trust. 18     There is one other matter which, though not\n                    addressed by either party, raises an issue of some importance, and that is\n                    whether either the Liquidators or the Company hadlocus\n                        standito lodge the respective caveats for the benefit of the\n                    unsecured creditors. Section 115 of the LTA states that a caveat may be\n                    lodged,inter alia, by “[a]ny person\n                    claiming an interest in land”, and it is not apparent to me what interest\n                    is being claimed by the Liquidators or the Company if the beneficial interest in\n                    the Property resides with the unsecured creditors of the Company, as the\n                    Liquidators contend. Nonetheless, as I have not heard submissions on this point,\n                    I express no concluded view on the matter.",
        "Whether the Property Was Available for Distribution to the Unsecured\n                Creditors notwithstanding Power Knight’s Interest": "",
        "Power Knight’s interest": "19     The nature of Power Knight’s interest in\n                    the Property must be determined from the Building Agreements and the Debenture.\n                    Although JTC never granted the Company a lease under the Building Agreements, an\n                    agreement for a lease creates an equitable lease:Golden\n                        Village Multiplex Pte Ltd v Marina Centre Holdings Pte Ltd[2002]\n                    1 SLR(R) 169 (per LP Thean JA at [12] and [15]). Under the terms\n                    of the Debenture, the Company charged its equitable leasehold interest to Power\n                    Knight as security, and this security interest was perfected when Power Knight\n                    registered the Debenture under s 131 of the CA on 9 June 2008. The\n                    material portion of s 131 reads: Registration of\n                        charges 131. – (1) Subject to this Division,\n                        where a charge to which this section applies is created by a company there\n                        shall be lodged with the Registrar for registration, within 30 days after\n                        the creation of the charge, a statement containing the prescribed\n                        particulars of the charge, and if this section is not complied with in\n                        relation to the charge the charge shall, so far as any security on the\n                        company’s property or undertaking is thereby conferred, be void\n                        against the liquidator and any creditor of the company. … 20     Under s 131(3)(e), a charge to which s 131(1) applies includes “a\n                    charge on land wherever situate or any interest therein”. As a result of\n                    registration, Power Knight obtained a security interest which would, ordinarily,\n                    be binding on the Company, the Liquidators, and any creditor of the\n                    Company. 21     There was some dispute as to the nature of\n                    Power Knight’s security interest, with counsel for the Liquidators\n                    characterising it as a fixed charge while counsel for Power Knight described it\n                    as more akin to an equitable mortgage. 22     This is a vexed issue, as the terms\n                    “charge” and “mortgage” have often been used\n                    interchangeably: seeGoode on Legal Problems of Credit and\n                        Security(Louise Gullifer ed) (Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        4thEd, 2008) (“Goode”), paras 1-51 – 1-52. Whether the\n                    Debenture gave rise to a charge or mortgage depends on the intention of the\n                    parties as objectively ascertained:Swiss Bank Corporation v\n                        Lloyds Bank Ltd and others[1982] AC 584 (per\n                    Buckley LJ at 595). It is clear from the Debenture that Power Knight could\n                    appoint receivers and managers, who were vested with extensive powers to manage,\n                    enter into possession and assume control of, as well as sell, the Property.\n                    Under the terms of the Debenture, Power Knight could itself exercise any of\n                    these rights, regardless of whether receivers and managers had been\n                    appointed. 23     One of the distinctions between a charge and\n                    an equitable mortgage is that the chargee is not entitled to avail himself of\n                    the self-help remedies of sale, possession or appointment of a receiver (though\n                    he may apply to the court for one of these remedies):Goode, para 1-51 (note 184),Fisher and\n                        Lightwood’s Law of Mortgage(Wayne Clark ed) (LexisNexis\n                    Butterworths, 12thEd, 2006), para 6.1 and\n                    6.3. 24     Given that the parties intended that Power\n                    Knight should have all the remedies available to a mortgagee, I am inclined to\n                    regard Power Knight’s security interest as an equitable\n                mortgage. 25     Nonetheless, I do not think that the technical\n                    distinctions between an equitable mortgage and an equitable charge make a\n                    difference to the issues in this case. Since a mortgage is a broader security\n                    and often includes a charge (seeGoode,\n                    para 1-52), for convenience, I have referred, and will continue to refer,\n                    to Power Knight’s interest as a “fixed\n                charge”.",
        "Are secured assets available for distribution among unsecured\n                creditors?": "26     The distinction between a charge and a\n                    mortgage is immaterial in this case because both types of security interest\n                    clearly confer equitable property rights in the Property on Power Knight and\n                    make it a secured creditor. One of the defining characteristics of a secured\n                    creditor is that, on the debtor’s insolvency, he is able to directly\n                    realise his security independently of the normal liquidation process. As Goode,Principles of Corporate Insolvency Law(Sweet\n                    & Maxwell, 3rdEd, 2005) (“Principles”) notes (at para 3-04): In general, a creditor holding a security interest or other real right is\n                        unaffected by winding-up and may proceed to realise his security or assert\n                        other rights of property as if the company were not in liquidation. This point is repeated by other learned commentators in the field of\n                    insolvency law (seeGoode, para 1-71, and\n                    Keay,McPherson’s Law of Company Liquidation(Sweet & Maxwell, 2ndEd, 2009)\n                        (“McPherson”),\n                    para 11.003), and must be correct in principle, for the entireraison d’êtreof taking security is to ensure that\n                    the secured asset will not fall into the debtor’s general pool of assets\n                    and will therefore be unavailable to the unsecured creditors. 27     The rule that upon liquidation only a\n                    company’s unencumbered or free assets are available for distribution among\n                    its unsecured creditors has a long and distinguished pedigree. It was repeatedly\n                    emphasised by the English Court of Appeal inRe\n                        Regent’s Canal Ironworks Co, ex parte Grissell(1875)\n                    3 Ch D 411 (per James LJ at 427),Re\n                        David Lloyd & Co(1877) 6 Ch D 339 (per\n                    James LJ at 344 – 345) andRe Pyle Works (No.\n                        1)(1890) LR 44 Ch D 534 (per\n                    Cotton LJ at 577 – 578), and was reaffirmed by the House of Lords inBuchler v Talbot[2004] 2 AC 298,\n                    where Lord Millet said at [51]: Bankruptcy and companies liquidation are concerned with the realisation\n                        and distribution of the insolvent’sfree\n                            assetsamong the unsecured creditors.They\n                            are not concerned with assets which have been charged to creditors as\n                            security, whether by way of fixed or floating charge. Secured creditors\n                            can resort to their security for the discharge of their debts outside\n                            the bankruptcy or winding up… [emphasis added] 28     The actual decision inBuchler v Talbot(that expenses properly incurred by the\n                    liquidator of an insolvent company are not payable out of assets subject to a\n                    floating charge) was statutorily reversed by s 1282 of the UK’s\n                    Companies Act 2006 (c 46), and does not apply in Singapore by virtue of\n                    ss 328(1) and 328(5) of the CA, which provide that such expenses have\n                    priority over the claims of holders of a floating charge. 29     Nonetheless, the force of the reasoning\n                    employed by their Lordships inBuchler v Talbot(which in fact appliesa fortiorito assets\n                    subject to a fixed charge) is not diminished, and the statutory provisions\n                    demonstrate thatbut forlegislative intervention,\n                    the common law position is that upon a winding up, secured assets are not\n                    available for distribution by the liquidator among the company’s unsecured\n                    creditors. 30     Consequently, even if, as the Liquidators\n                    contend, a statutory trust arose on the winding up of the Company for the\n                    benefit of the unsecured creditors, in my judgment, the subject matter of such a\n                    trust could not include the Property, which was already validly encumbered by\n                    Power Knight’s fixed charge and therefore unavailable to the unsecured\n                    creditors. 31     This view is strengthened by Lord\n                    Hoffmann’s statement inBuchler v Talbotat\n                    [28] that “the [statutory] trust applies only to the company’s\n                    property. It does not affect the proprietary interests of others.” A\n                    similar conclusion is expressed by Lord Brightman inRoberts\n                        Petroleum Ltd v Bernard Kenny Ltd[1983] 2 AC 192 at\n                    208 where he states that: … the statutory duty of the liquidator in [a winding up] is to\n                        collect the assets of the company and to apply them in discharge of its\n                        liabilities…The assets which the liquidator is able to collect and\n                            distribute are however necessarily those which are free from a\n                            charge. [emphasis added] 32     Counsel for the Liquidators submits, however,\n                    thatMichael Ngestablishes that on a winding up,\n                    unsecured creditors obtain a beneficial interest in a company’s property,includingits encumbered assets. It is\n                    therefore necessary to examineMichael Ngin\n                    detail.",
        "Michael Ng": "33     The facts inMichael\n                        Ngwere essentially the obverse of this case. A company had\n                    granted an equitable mortgage over registered land to the respondent\n                    (“OCBC”). OCBC lodged a caveat claiming an interest as equitable\n                    mortgagee in respect of the land but did not register the equitable mortgage\n                    under s 131 of the CA. OCBC enforced the equitable mortgage and obtained a\n                    court order authorising it to sell the land, but on 6 May 1994, before it\n                    could do so, the second appellants (the unsecured creditors) presented a winding\n                    up application. The winding-up proceedings took some time and on 13 April\n                    1995 OCBC sold the land. The winding-up order was eventually made on 5 May\n                    1995 and the first appellants were appointed liquidators of the company. The\n                    appellants then sought to claim that the equitable mortgage was void for want of\n                    registration under s 131, and that the proceeds of the sale of the land\n                    should be paid over to the first appellants. 34     The Court of Appeal was concerned with two\n                    issues. First, whether the equitable mortgage was void against the first\n                    appellantsqualiquidators of the company; and\n                    second, whether the equitable mortgage was void against the second appellantsquaunsecured creditors of the company. The\n                    Court of Appeal decided the first issue against the liquidators, and that\n                    portion of the judgment is not material to this case. However, the Court of\n                    Appeal held that, as regards the second appellantsquaunsecured creditors, the equitable mortgage was\n                void. 35     LP Thean JA, on behalf of the Court of\n                    Appeal, held that the reference to “any creditor” in s 131 of\n                    the CA did not include an unsecured creditor while the company was a going\n                    concern, as such a creditor had no interest in the company’s property. It\n                    was only upon the presentation of a winding up petition that a statutory trust\n                    came into being for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, who thereby obtained\n                    a beneficial interest in the assets of the company, and could therefore be\n                    considered a “creditor” in the sense of s 131 of the\n                    CA. 36     The key portion of the judgment, upon which\n                    counsel for the Liquidators relies, is at [31], where LP Thean JA\n                    states: … On the basis of all the authorities which we have discussed,\n                        s 131(1) of the Companies Act does not apply in favour of an unsecured\n                        creditor and an unregistered charge is not void as against such a creditor,\n                        while the company is a going concern. This is because he is not entitled to\n                        prevent the company from paying off the debt secured by the unregistered\n                        charge or granting a confirmatory charge. An unsecured creditor has no\n                        interest in the assets of a company and is powerless to restrain it from\n                        dealing with its assets as it wishes. This state of affairs which prevails\n                        while the company is a going concern ceases on the presentation of a\n                        winding-up petition. As from that date, the company is no longer at liberty\n                        to pay off the debt owed or grant a confirmatory charge to the chargee.\n                        Under s 259 read together with s 255(2) of the Companies Act, any\n                        disposition of the company’s property from the presentation of the\n                        winding-up petition is void unless it is sanctioned by the court. A\n                        statutory scheme comes into place to preserve the assets of the company forpari passudistribution among the\n                        unsecured creditors: see,inter alia,\n                        ss 258, 259, 260, 334 of the Companies Act; and the unsecured creditors\n                        of a company are in the nature of acestui que\n                            trustwith beneficial interests extending to all the\n                        company’s property, including the subject matter of the unregistered\n                        charge. The avoidance of the unregistered charge would, after all, free the\n                        subject matter of the charge to swell the assets of the company for the\n                        benefit of the unsecured creditors. In our judgment, on the presentation of\n                        a winding-up petition, an unsecured creditor acquires sufficient interest in\n                        the subject matter of the unregistered charge so as to qualify as a\n                        “creditor” for the purposes of s 131(1). 37     Counsel for the Liquidator contends that,\n                    since the registration requirement under s 131 of the CA is required only\n                    to perfect the chargevis-à-visother creditors\n                    (seeGoode, para 2-22), the unregistered\n                    charge inMichael Ngwas valid and enforceable as\n                    against the company, and since, according to LP Thean JA, an unsecured creditor\n                    must have an interest in the company’s property before he can rely on\n                    s 131, the second appellants inMichael Ngmust, on the presentation of the winding up have, had an interest in the land\n                    subject to the unregistered charge in order to invoke s 131 and avoid the\n                    charge. Therefore,Michael Ngdemonstrates that\n                    encumbered assets are caught by the statutory trust. 38     This argument is ingenious but it is not, in\n                    my judgment, correct. I do not readMichael Ngas\n                    contradicting the well-established position (see[26]to[31]above) that\n                    unsecured creditors, on a winding up, have no recourse to the debtor’s\n                    secured assets. In my opinion, whatMichael Ngdecides is that an unsecured creditor only haslocus\n                        standito invoke s 131 of the CA when a winding up petition\n                    is presented, as it is only from that date that he becomes interested in the\n                    property of the company, which will, once s 131 is relied upon, include the\n                    subject matter of the unregistered charge. The sequence of events therefore runs\n                    as follows: upon the presentation of a winding up petition, the unsecured\n                    creditors obtain a beneficial interest in the unencumbered property of the\n                    company. By virtue of that interest, an unsecured creditor obtainslocus standito invoke s 131 to avoid the\n                    unregistered charge, and the charged property is then freed from the charge,\n                    falling into the general pool of assets which is to be distributed among the\n                    unsecured creditors. 39     This reading is confirmed by LP\n                    Thean JA’s statement that “[t]he avoidance of the unregistered\n                    charge would, after all, free the subject matter of the charge to swell the\n                    assets of the company for the benefit of the unsecured\n                creditors.” 40     Consequently, in this respect, the Liquidators\n                    derive no benefit fromMichael Ng, which was\n                    concerned with whether an unsecured creditor had, upon the presentation of a\n                    winding up petition, standing to avoid an unregistered charge under s 131\n                    of the CA.Michael Ngdoes not support the\n                    contention that an unsecured creditor, in and by virtue of a winding up, has a\n                    beneficial interest in property subject to aregisteredcharge. That this cannot be the case is implicit in\n                    LP Thean JA’s statement at[39]above: where a charge has been validly registered under s 131 of the CA (as\n                    in this case) and cannot be avoided, the subject matter of the charge isnotfreed “to swell the assets of the\n                    company for the benefit of the unsecured creditors”. 41     Therefore, I conclude that the unsecured\n                    creditors of the Company have no interest in the Property, the equitable\n                    leasehold interest in which has been validly charged to Power Knight. It follows\n                    that they do not claim “an interest in land” for the purposes of\n                    lodging a caveat under s 115 of the LTA, and the Liquidators’ Caveat\n                    and the Company’s Caveat must be removed. 42     That is sufficient to dispose of this case,\n                    but as counsel have submitted full arguments on the remaining issues, and it is\n                    likely that this judgment will be appealed, I will set out my views on the first\n                    two issues I alluded to in[16].",
        "The Statutory Trust": "",
        "Existence of the statutory trust": "43     Although counsel for Power Knight pointed out\n                    that the statutory trust is not recognised in Australia after the High Court of\n                    Australia’s decision inCommissioner of Taxation of the\n                        Commonwealth of Australia v Linter Textiles Australia Ltd (in\n                        liquidation)(2005) 220 CLR 592 (“Linter Textiles”), in my opinion this issue has\n                    clearly been decided in Singapore byMichael\n                    Ng. 44     Although not referred to inMichael Ng, the leading modern authority on the statutory trust\n                    isAyerst (Inspector of Taxes) v C & K (Construction)\n                        Ltd[1976] AC 167 (“Ayerst”), a decision of the House of Lords. There, Lord\n                    Diplock confirmed the existence of the statutory trust on the basis that upon\n                    the making of a winding up order, by operation of the relevant provisions of the\n                    CA, a company loses all custody and control of its property, and all powers of\n                    dealing with the company’s assets are transferred to a liquidator who is\n                    to act in accordance with the statutory scheme set out in the CA. Consequently,\n                    Lord Diplock held, by operation of statute, upon the making of a winding up\n                    order, a statutory trust comes into effect because the company, despite\n                    remaining legal owner of its property, loses all beneficial ownership to\n                    it. 45     As is clear from the judgment of LP\n                    Thean JA quoted in[36]above, the\n                    Court of Appeal inMichael Ngendorsed the concept\n                    of a statutory trust for essentially the same reasons as those given by Lord\n                    Diplock inAyerst. 46     Although it is occasionally suggested thatAyerstonly decided that a company was\n                    divested of “beneficial ownership” of its assets for the purposes\n                    of interpreting a specific provision of the UK’s Finance Act 1954 (c 44)\n                    (see, for example,Low Gim Har v Low Gim Siah[1992] 1 SLR(R) 970, per Chan Sek Keong J at [23] – [26]),\n                    I do not, with respect, think it is possible to limitAyerstin this manner. 47     First, Lord Diplock himself inAyerst, at 179 – 181, relied on and endorsed\n                    earlier authorities (which predated the earliest Finance Act) which had\n                    recognised the existence of the statutory trust as a matter of common law.\n                    Second,Ayersthas been repeatedly cited as\n                    establishing, without qualification, that upon the winding up of a company, a\n                    statutory trust is established over the company’s assets:Buchler v Talbot(per Lord Hoffmann at [28]),Wight v Eckhardt Marine GmbH[2004] 1 AC 147\n                    (per Lord Hoffmann at [22]) andCambridge Gas Transport Corp\n                        v Official Committee of Unsecured Creditors of Navigator Holdings\n                        Plc[2007] 1 AC 508 (per Lord Hoffmann at [14]).\n                    Finally, exactly the same criticism may be employed against other landmark cases\n                    which, while ostensibly concerned with interpreting specific points of revenue\n                    law, have always been taken as representing the common law: for example,Commissioner of Stamp Duties (Queensland) v Hugh Duncan\n                        Livingston[1965] 1 AC 694 (“Commissioner of Stamp Duties v Livingston”) andMcPhail and others v Doulton and others[1971]\n                    1 AC 424.",
        "Nature of the statutory trust": "48     Notwithstanding the long line of authorities\n                    recognising the existence of the statutory trust, its exact nature has been a\n                    matter of some controversy. Although it is sometimes said that the statutory\n                    trust is created “in favour of” the general body of unsecured\n                    creditors (seeRe Yagerphone Ltd[1935] Ch 392 at 396 andRe Anglo-Oriental Carpet\n                        Manufacturing Company[1903] 1 Ch 914 at 918), the\n                    prevailing view is stated inPrinciples,\n                    para 3-08 (see alsoMcPherson,\n                    para 7.006): Seventh principle: no creditor has\n                            any interestin speciein the company’s assets or\n                        realisations The statutory trust upon which the company in winding up holds the assets\n                        and realisations is not of a kind which confers on the creditors beneficial\n                        co-ownership or, indeed, a proprietary interest of any kind. Their rights\n                        are limited to invoking the protection of the court to ensure that the\n                        liquidator fulfils his statutory duties. Their position is analogous to that\n                        of residuary legatees in an unadministered estate. They have a right to\n                        compel performance of the executor’s duties but no interest in the\n                        assets comprising the estate until completion of the administration, during\n                        which time beneficial ownership of the assets is in suspense. The company\n                        thus holds the assets for statutory purposes, not for persons\n                        … 49     I should point out, however, that the analogy\n                    to a residuary legatee was one of the considerations that prompted the High\n                    Court of Australia inLinter Textilesto hold that\n                    the statutory trust did not exist. In the case of an unadministered estate, it\n                    cannot be said until administration is complete what the residue will consist of\n                    or what its value will be, and so the requisite certainty of subject-matter for\n                    the existence of a trust is lacking. Consequently, the executor of an\n                    unadministered estate is not a trustee, but holds the legal and beneficial title\n                    to the testator’s property in full right:Commissioner\n                        of Stamp Duties v Livingston. The High Court of Australia inLinter Textilestherefore preferred the view\n                    that upon winding up, a company remains full legal and beneficial owner of its\n                    property, but is statutorily disabled from enjoying that ownership. This view is\n                    attractive, as the analogy between the two situations is compelling: in neither\n                    administration nor liquidation can it be ascertained, until the exercise is\n                    completed, what residual assets (if any) are to be distributed to the residuary\n                    legatee or unsecured creditor. It might therefore not be appropriate to speak of\n                    a “trust” at all. 50     Nonetheless, although Lord Diplock was clearly\n                    aware of this point (seeAyerstat 176), he\n                    confirmed the concept of the statutory trust, pointing out that the word\n                    “statutory” indicated that “the trust does not bear all the\n                    indicia which characterise a trust as it was recognised by the Court of Chancery\n                    apart from statute”. 51     Therefore, on this view, the “statutory\n                    trust” is a purpose trust, with the beneficial interest “in\n                    suspense”. The company holds the legal title to its property on trust for\n                    the purposes of the statutory scheme administered by the liquidator. Since this\n                    scheme is intended to be for the benefit of the unsecured creditors, it may\n                    loosely be said that the statutory trust is “in favour of” the\n                    unsecured creditors. However, this is a misleading use of language, for it then\n                    becomes natural to regard the unsecured creditors as ordinary beneficiaries\n                    having beneficial interests in the company’s assets, when in fact, during\n                    the course of the winding up, they have only a hope of obtaining such interests.\n                    In principle, therefore, I agree with the view that, notwithstanding that the\n                    making of a winding up order brings into existence a statutory trust, unsecured\n                    creditors have no proprietary interests in a company’s property:Mitchell v Carter[1997] 1 BCLC 681 (per\n                    Millett LJ at 686),Re Calgary and Edmonton Land Co Ltd\n                        (in liquidation)[1975] 1 WLR 355 (per Megarry J\n                    at 359),Re A Caveat, ex parte The Canowie Pastoral Company\n                        Limited[1931] SASR 502 (per Angas Parsons J at\n                    505),Ayerst, Bulcher v Talbot(per Lord Hoffmann\n                    at [28]), andCommissioner of Stamp Duties v\n                        Livingston. 52     It follows that I respectfully disagree with\n                    the statement by the Court of Appeal in [31] ofMichael\n                        Ngthat, as from the presentation of a winding up petition,\n                    “the unsecured creditors of a company are in the nature of acestui que trustwith beneficial interests extending to\n                    all the company’s property”. Apart from its inconsistency with the\n                    nature of the statutory trust, there are difficulties in making, asMichael Ngdoes, the date of presentation of a winding\n                    up petition (as opposed to the date of the winding up order) the operative date\n                    from which the statutory trust commences: see Lee, “Unsecured Creditor\n                    Versus Unregistered Charge” (1998) 10 SAcLJ 241 at p\n                    244. 53     However, as I am bound by the authority ofMichael Ng, it is not open to me to hold that\n                    the unsecured creditors have no beneficial interests in the assets of the\n                    Company which are within the ambit of the statutory trust. As I have already\n                    decided (at[30]and[41]above), however, that these assets do not\n                    include the Property, which has been validly charged to Power Knight, whatever\n                    beneficial interests the unsecured creditors may have in the Company’s\n                    assets do not include an “interest in land” for the purposes of\n                    lodging a caveat under s 115 of the LTA.",
        "Conclusion": "54     For the foregoing reasons, I grant Power\n                    Knight’s application and order that the Liquidators’ Caveat and the\n                    Company’s Caveat be removed. I will hear the parties on\n                costs."
