        "Introduction": "1       This case concerns ancillary\n                    matters flowing from the breakdown of a long marriage of 36\n                    years. The parties, who were married on 9 December\n                        1972[note: 1], are\n                    now well into their mid-60s – the wife is 65 years old\n                    and the husband is 66 years old. Divorce proceedings were\n                    commenced by the wife on 4 February 2008, and the\n                    interim judgment for divorce was granted on 18 April\n                    2008. 2       The parties had two children\n                    during their marriage. Both are independent and\n                    self-supporting – the daughter is now 37 years old,\n                    and the son, 35 years old[note: 2]– and no custody issue arises. The ancillary issues at\n                    hand thus relate only to the just and equitable division of\n                    the matrimonial assets, and maintenance of the wife that\n                    would be reasonable in the circumstances.",
        "Relevant facts": "3       After the parties married in\n                    1972, they stayed in a 2-room flat in Toa Payoh at a monthly\n                    rental of $40, paid by the husband.[note: 3]They\n                    moved into a 5-room HDB flat in Ghim Moh (“Ghim Moh\n                    flat”) in 1976[note: 4], and\n                    subsequently bought a terrace house at Namly Place\n                    (“the Namly House”), which they rented out\n                    from 1993 to 1996 at $1,800 per month.[note: 5]They\n                    began to live in the Namly House in September\n                        1996.[note: 6]In\n                    October 1999, three years after moving into the Namly House,\n                    differences between the parties drove the wife to move to a\n                    separate bedroom in the Namly House (“the Separate\n                    Bedrooms Arrangement”).[note: 7]",
        "Respective financial contributions to the\n                family": "4       It was undisputed that the\n                    husband was, throughout the marriage, the main breadwinner\n                    of the family.[note: 8]By\n                    contrast, the wife had been a homemaker since the birth of\n                    the children. She did, however, engage in part-time or ad\n                    hoc work from time to time[note: 9], which\n                    gave her the flexibility to care for the children and the\n                    family. The wife’s low level of income during the\n                    marriage was reflected in a record of her employment history\n                    between 1980 and 2008, produced by the husband.[note: 10] 5       The Namly House was\n                    purchased at $780,000.[note: 11]The\n                    mortgage has since been discharged. Its current value is\n                    approximately $3.4 million. The parties’ respective\n                    direct financial contributions towards the purchase of the\n                    Namly House are disputed. While the husband claims to have\n                    paid 100% of the purchase price[note: 12],\n                    the wife claims to have contributed 12% of the purchase\n                    price using $19,000 from her CPF account and $78,000\n                    withdrawn from her POSB Bank account and paid towards the\n                    10% deposit[note: 13](see[41]below). 6       Of her indirect financial\n                    contributions, the wife pointed to[note: 14](a) payments allegedly made for household furnishing,\n                    renovations, and landscaping; and (b) her share of the Ghim\n                    Moh flat sale proceeds, which she claims to have ploughed\n                    back as loan repayments in respect of the Namly\n                        House.[note: 15]",
        "Respective non-financial contributions to the\n                family": "7       The wife’s\n                    non-financial contributions to the family were quite\n                    substantial. As the family did not engage domestic help for\n                    most part of the marriage[note: 16], the\n                    wife did the marketing and took care of the household and\n                    the children.[note: 17]It\n                    was also the wife who managed the tenancy matters of the\n                    Namly House during the period of its rental,viz, putting out and paying for\n                    advertisements, arranging for viewings of the house and\n                    collecting rent.[note: 18] 8       The husband claims that he\n                    also made non-financial contributions to the household by\n                    cooking for the family, doing the household chores and\n                    participating in the upbringing of the children.[note: 19]This\n                    is disputed by the wife who claims that the husband was an\n                    absent father.[note: 20]She claims that instances of the “recent\n                    phenomenon” of him cooking for the family are few and\n                    far between.[note: 21]The children have not sworn any affidavit in support of\n                    either parent.",
        "Earning capacity of each party": "9       The husband claims that he\n                    is currently unemployed, with a last drawn gross monthly\n                    salary of $10,300 as of 31 March 2008.[note: 22]In\n                    other words, he ceased to be gainfully employed some three\n                    weeks after the divorce was granted. His position is that\n                    while he continues to assist his son and daughter-in-law in\n                    the running of their company (“the Company”),\n                    he does not draw a salary and has no interest in the\n                        Company.[note: 23]Indeed, the relevant ACRA documents state the parties’\n                    son as the manager and the daughter-in-law as the sole\n                    proprietor of the Company.[note: 24]I\n                    note that while the wife asserts that the Company is the\n                    husband’s own business[note: 25], she\n                    has not produced any objective evidence proving the same.\n                    She relies instead on her belief that the business is\n                    “a very specialised field which only [the husband]\n                    would have expertise and experience in”.[note: 26]",
        "Wife’s case / Husband’s\n                case": "",
        "Division of matrimonial assets": "10     The husband claims that\n                    his assets are worth $562,864.56 and the wife’s\n                    disclosed assets total $180,925.[note: 27]The wife claims that her assets are worth only\n                        $64,582.89[note: 28]and\n                    that the husband’s disclosed assets are worth at least\n                        $835,627.25.[note: 29]Each\n                    accuses the other of failing to disclose substantial assets\n                    (see[15]to[28]below). 11     The wife submits that, for\n                    the sake of convenience, only the Namly House should be\n                    divided while considering all the matrimonial assets of the\n                        couple.[note: 30]This\n                    was the only common ground between the parties. She claims\n                    70% of the Namly House sale proceeds.[note: 31] 12     The husband, however,\n                    argues that the maximum proportion of the matrimonial assets\n                    the wife should get is 25% of the Namly House sale\n                        proceeds.[note: 32]He claims\n                    that in light of the Separate Bedrooms Arrangement, parties\n                    had effectively been married for only three years after\n                    moving into the Namly House, and that, since the children\n                    had become independent by then, “the\n                    Plaintiff’s non-financial contributions for the Namly\n                    Place terrace house were not\n                        significant”.[note: 33]",
        "Maintenance": "13     While the husband is only\n                    willing to pay a lump sum maintenance of $12,000 ($200/mth x\n                    12 x 5 years)[note: 34], the\n                    wife claims a lump sum of $179,400, calculated in the\n                    following manner[note: 35]: (a)     Future\n                        maintenance: $1,400/mth x 12 x 8 years =\n                    $134,400 (b)     Maintenance in arrears: $1,250/mth x\n                        12 x 3 years = $45,000 The claim for\n                    maintenance in arrears arises from the husband’s\n                    failure (from March 2008 to-date) to adhere to a Consent\n                    Maintenance Order made in 1999 (see[63]below).",
        "Issues before the Court": "14     I shall deal with the\n                    following issues in turn: (a)     What are the\n                        matrimonial assets to be included in the common pool for\n                        division? (b)     Taking into account all the\n                        circumstances, what would be a just and equitable\n                        division of the matrimonial assets? (c)     In what manner\n                        should such division be effected? (d)     Taking into\n                        account all the circumstances, what would be a\n                        reasonable quantum of the lump sum maintenance to be\n                        ordered in favour of the wife?",
        "The common pool of matrimonial assets": "15     The parties cannot agree\n                    on the total value of the matrimonial assets. Although they\n                    agree that the Namly House is worth about $3.4 million\n                    (there is an in-principle agreement expressed to be\n                    effective from 27 April 2012 to 31 May 2012 to\n                    sell the house at $3.4 million), there is a vast difference\n                    in the valuation of the assets held in each party’s\n                    name. 16     During the hearing on\n                    9 April 2012, counsel for the wife, Mr Wong Khai Leng\n                    (“Mr Wong”), tendered a helpful supplementary\n                    Comparative Table of Matrimonial Assets (“the\n                    Comparative Table”) setting out and explaining the\n                    disparities between each party’s valuation of the\n                    assets. After examining the evidence adduced by the\n                    respective parties, I determine the husband’s assets\n                    to be $700,800 and the wife’s assets to be $67,500.\n                    For ease of reference, my determination is set out in the\n                    tables at[17]and[24]below.",

These are based on\n                    valuations as at July 2008 and supported by\n                        evidence.[note: 38]I reject the\n                    husband’s unsubstantiated figures including his\n                    valuation of Item 2 which is similarly\n                        unsubstantiated.[note: 39]I rely instead on the wife’s figure ($93,215), which\n                    is supported by an SGX statement exhibited in the\n                    husband’s own affidavit.[note: 40]I also prefer the\n                    wife’s valuation of the debt due to the husband from\n                    his brother (Item 11) as at September 2009.[note: 41]Although the husband\n                    claims that $12,000 has been repaid into his OCBC Easisave\n                    account reducing the debt due to $80,500, he has not\n                    produced any proof of such deposit.[note: 42] 19     With respect to Item 6, I\n                    reject the wife’s figure ($46,265.90) which is\n                    unsupported by evidence.[note: 43]Item 12 is not raised\n                    by the wife, but as the husband volunteers the figure of\n                        $4,000[note: 44],\n                    I have included it in the common pool. I disregard Item 13\n                    as there is nothing, apart from the husband’s bare\n                    assertion, to prove the alleged debt of $6,100 due from the\n                    wife. 20     The wife claims that the\n                    husband owns undisclosed balances in bank accounts that were\n                    closed and sale proceeds in relation to shares/unit trusts\n                    sold upon the service of divorce papers.[note: 45]The HSBC statement and letters from OCBC and DBS[note: 46]do\n                    support the inference that the husband had closed some of\n                    his bank accounts and sold some shares upon commencement of\n                    divorce proceedings. 21     Where a party fails to\n                    discharge his or her duty to provide full and frank\n                    disclosure, the court may draw an adverse inference against\n                    that person by ordering a higher proportion of the disclosed\n                    assets to the other party or, where possible, proceed to\n                    determine the actual value of the undisclosed assets based\n                    on available information, and include such value in the pool\n                    of assets to be divided (seeNK v\n                        NL[2007] 3 SLR(R) 743\n                        (“NK v NL”)\n                    at [57]–[62] andO’Connor\n                        Rosamund Monica v Potter Derek John[2011]\n                    3 SLR 294 (“Rosamund”) at [38]). 22     In light of the foregoing,\n                    I would draw an adverse inference against the husband in\n                    relation to Items 3 and 4 as he has failed to disclose\n                    the whereabouts of the proceeds of those unit trusts sold in\n                    March 2008 for $26,486.20.[note: 47]I would\n                    also draw an adverse inference against him in relation to\n                    Item 7. The bank account was closed shortly after the\n                    commencement of divorce proceedings, on 5 March\n                        2008[note: 48],\n                    and he has not accounted for the whereabouts of the closing\n                    balance ($28,087.19).[note: 49]On that same day, the balance of $4,045.15 in the bank\n                    account under Item 9 was cashed out.[note: 50]Again, no satisfactory\n                    account has been given for the whereabouts of the sum, and I\n                    have accordingly drawn an adverse inference against\n                    him. 23     I reject both\n                    parties’ valuations of Item 8. The wife relies on\n                    the figure as at February 2008 ($113,000)[note: 51]. $92,500 was\n                    prematurely withdrawn as a loan to the husband’s\n                        brother[note: 52], and has been\n                    accounted for under Item 11. I thus take the net figure\n                    to be $20,500. The husband has not accounted for the\n                    dissipation of the balance to $13,000 between March to June\n                        2008[note: 53], and to $0 in July\n                        2008.[note: 54]",

For Item 4, I have adopted the\n                    husband’s valuation ($8,144), which is the maturity\n                    value of the policy as discovered by the wife[note: 57], and rejected the\n                    wife’s unsubstantiated valuation of $5,192.28. As for\n                    Item 5, the husband’s valuation ($23,319.33) was\n                    wrongly premised on the sum insured under the policy, and so\n                    I reject it. This is an annuity policy. The monthly\n                    annuities of $107.04 were paid into the wife’s POSB\n                    Bank account (Item 6), and to avoid double counting, I\n                    disregard Item 5. The difference in the parties’\n                    valuation of Item 7 was only $8.70 and so I accept the\n                    higher figure volunteered by the wife. As for Item 11, the\n                    husband relies on outdated 2006 and 2007\n                        statements[note: 58], which I\n                reject. 26     I have valued Items 6, 8\n                    and 9 based on the wife’s figures as at July/August\n                    2008, which were closer to the date of the interim judgment,\n                    rather than the figures used by the husband, which were\n                    based on valuations as at December 2008 and\n                    September/December 2009. There is no fixed operative date\n                    for the determination and valuation of matrimonial assets\n                    (seeAnthony Patrick Nathan v Chan Siew\n                        Chin[2011] 4 SLR 1121 at [18], [25] and [29]). Given that the\n                    ancillary hearings only took place four years after the\n                    interim judgment was granted in April 2008, and given the\n                    adverse inferences I drew against the husband in relation to\n                    his treatment of his assets in the interim period (see[20]to[22]above), I am of the view\n                    that it would be appropriate to value the assets as at\n                    2008. 27     The husband claims that\n                    the wife has failed to provide full disclosure of her bank\n                        accounts.[note: 59]Relying\n                    onRosamund, he argues that\n                    the wife had been extremely uncooperative throughout the\n                    discovery process, and so, an adverse inference should be\n                    drawn against her. The alleged\n                    “uncooperativeness” of the wife on the present\n                    facts is, however, a far cry from that inRosamund, where the court drew an adverse\n                    inference against the wife who had failed to satisfactorily\n                    explain her failure to disclose details of her bank accounts\n                    which were revealed during discovery (Rosamundat [39]–[43]). On the present facts, despite the\n                    husband’s attempts to uncover undisclosed DBS accounts\n                    belonging to the wife, and the Court Order dated\n                    23 November 2011 allowing him to administer\n                    interrogatories to DBS’ representative, nothing has\n                    been uncovered, and costs of $3,400 was awarded in favour of\n                    the wife.[note: 60] 28     The husband claims that\n                    the wife has under-declared the value of her jewellery (Item\n                    10) as $13,000 when they are actually worth\n                        $80,000.[note: 61]A\n                    spouse cannot ask the court to draw an adverse inference of\n                    the financial worth of the other spouse simply because\n                    he/she claims that that spouse is worth “at\n                    least” a certain amount (Rosamundat [37]). He must be able to adduce\n                    “some substratum of evidence that establishes aprima faciecase against\n                    the person against whom the inference is to be drawn”\n                        (Koh Bee Choo v Choo Chai\n                        Huah[2007] SGCA 21 at [28]). As the husband has\n                    not been able to do so, I have rejected the husband’s\n                    unsubstantiated valuation of Item 10 at $80,000 and adopted\n                    the wife’s valuation at $13,000.",

The goal is to\n                    achieve a just and equitable division, taking into account\n                    all circumstances of the case, including the factors listed\n                    under s 112(2) of the Act (seeNK v\n                        NLat [20]). 31     A few principles must be\n                    borne in mind. First, no one factor is determinative (seeNK v NLat [29]). Secondly, the court\n                    should not treat the respective financial contributions of\n                    each party as theprima faciestarting point, before making adjustments to reflect their\n                    non-financial contributions (seeNK v\n                        NLat [23]–[24] and [27]).

Rather, it should\n                    be prepared to make a rough and ready approximation in the\n                    absence of documentary evidence, based on “feel and\n                    the court’s sense of justice” (seeNK v NLat [28] andYeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy[2011] 2 SLR 1157(“Yeo\n                        Chong Lin (CA)”) at\n                [78]).",

(2)   The Wife’s age and financial\n                dependence 65     The husband claims that\n                    the wife owes him $3,900, which was borrowed between October\n                    2009 and March 2010,[note: 89]and that up till January 2011, the outstanding debt due from\n                    the wife amounted to $6,100.[note: 90]He produced\n                    some receipts that were signed by the wife in support of the\n                    $3,900 loan.[note: 91]If the documents, which\n                    have annotations such as\n                    “marketing/food/supplement” and\n                    “dental”, are taken to be probative of the\n                    alleged loans, such loans for those stated purposes could be\n                    suggestive of the wife’s lack of financial\n                    independence, and the inadequacy of the monthly $200\n                    payments she is currently receiving from the\n                husband. 66     To this extent, the\n                    husband’s reliance onTan Bee\n                        Bee[note: 92]is\n                    misplaced – the wife inTan Bee\n                        Beewas financially strong and the Judge had\n                    specifically found that she did not require maintenance\n                        (Tan Bee Beeat [24]). His reliance onTay Ang Choo Nancy v Yeo Chong Lin\n                        and another[2010] SGHC 126\n                        (“Yeo Chong Lin\n                        (HC)”)[note: 93]is\n                    also problematic. The court inYeo Chong\n                        Lin (HC)chose not to make a maintenance\n                    order in light of the fact that the wife had received more\n                    than $11 million post division of assets. Given that she was\n                    already 71 years old, the court was of the opinion that her\n                    financial resources were unlikely to be exhausted in her\n                    lifetime (seeYeo Chong Lin\n                        (HC)at [60]). 67     Given the wife’s\n                    relatively old age (65), and the long period for which she\n                    has been away from the workforce, it would be unreasonable\n                    to require her to seek employment now.[note: 94] (3)   The Husband’s age and financial\n                ability 68     The husband is now 66\n                    years old. As mentioned (at[9]above), there is a dispute over whether\n                    he is currently drawing any salary from the Company. The\n                    wife has not produced credible evidence proving the same.\n                    However, despite the husband’s retirement, I note that\n                    he owns fairly substantial assets in the form of shares,\n                    unit funds, cash and CPF monies, and would be able to meet\n                    the maintenance order. 69     I note that there was no\n                    indication as to the wife’s living arrangement after\n                    the sale of the Namly House, and indeed, she does not claim\n                    any rental which she might subsequently have to incur.\n                    Taking into account all the circumstances, in particular,\n                    the wife’s monthly expenses of $2,415, which seems\n                    reasonable, her old age, the fact that the children have\n                    since ceased making contributions towards her monthly\n                    expenses (the wife has undertaken to file an affidavit that\n                    she has ceased receiving any monthly contribution from the\n                    children since late last year), her monthly AIA annuities of\n                    $107.04, as well as the husband’s retirement, his\n                    assets and his age, a fair and reasonable multiplicand would\n                    be $1,300 per month for the future maintenance. This amount\n                    does not present a “meal-ticket for life” as\n                    it requires the wife to be self-reliant to some\n                    extent. Arrears in maintenance 70     There is also no reason\n                    why the husband should not be required to pay the monthly\n                    arrears in maintenance of $1,250 for the last three years.\n                    Ms Lee argues that the wife ceased to be a\n                    “married woman” with effect from the date of\n                    the interim judgment, and so, her claim for arrears in\n                    maintenance amounting to $45,000 is untenable.[note: 95]She\n                    argues that the wife should have applied for interim\n                    maintenance. I cannot agree with Ms Lee’s\n                    submissions. First, dissolution of a marriage does not of\n                    itself put an end to a maintenance order. As observed inHalsbury’svol 11at [130.700]: Short of death there is no event\n                            that immediately terminates a maintenance order that\n                            is continuing.The\n                            order continues until another court order is made\n                            that it be rescinded.The Women’s\n                        Charter provides that the court may rescind a\n                        maintenance order on proof of a change in the\n                        circumstances of the applicant for rescission, his wife\n                        or child or for any other good cause. This confirms the\n                        discretion that lies with the court...there is still\n                        discretion whether to rescind the maintenance order for\n                        the reason that the beneficiary has since become\n                        divorced from the payor. Only where the court regards\n                        the circumstances as justifying rescission will it be\n                        ordered.Thus, a maintenance order\n                            for a validly married woman need not be rescinded\n                            when she ceases to be so. [emphasis added] Secondly, a wife should not generally be compelled\n                    to apply for interim maintenance pending the hearing of\n                    ancillaries if she is willing or able to wait until the\n                    ancillary matters are heard (AMW v\n                        AMZ[2011] 3 SLR 955\n                        (“AMW v\n                    AMZ”) at [10]–[11]). The Multipler 71     Effectively, the wife is\n                    seeking a multiplier of 11 years, three years in arrears and\n                    eight for the future. Mr Wong tendered information from\n                    the Department of Statistics, Singapore (DSS) to show that\n                    the life expectancy of Singaporean women is now 84.1 years.\n                    This was to support his submission that a higher multiplier\n                    should be applied, and that assessment on the\n                    “straight line basis” inOng Chen Leng v Tan SauPoo[1993] 2 SLR(R) 545\n                        (“Ong Cheng\n                    Leng”) should not be followed. The life\n                    expectancy of the wife is, however, not the sole factor\n                    influencing the assessment of the appropriate multiplier.\n                    Other factors are also relevant,eg, the possibility of the wife remarrying,\n                    the proportion of matrimonial assets allocated to the wife,\n                    the husband’s retirement,etc. 72     It is trite that the\n                    approach inOng Chen Leng(maintenance up till 67 years old, as a compromise\n                    between the average life expectancy of a woman (70) and\n                    the usual retirement age of a Singapore male\n                    worker (65)) does not apply invariably. InNg Ngah Len(at [13]), Prakash J took\n                    the husband’s retirement age as 68, observing that\n                    while he had no compulsory retirement age (since he was\n                    self-employed), there was no need for him to work till he\n                    dropped as he was well-heeled. A multiplier of 16 years was\n                    applied, in consideration of the fact that that would take\n                    the wife who was 46 years old into her early 60s, and\n                    that even if she should live a considerable period\n                    therefrom, the extremely large lump sum ordered ($20,250/mth\n                    x 12 x 16 = $3,888,000) should allow her to enjoy a\n                    reasonably comfortable life. 73     InFoo\n                        Ah Yan, lump sum maintenance was computed\n                    until the wife was 67 years old. Although the husband who\n                    was 72 years old had retired in his 50s, just a year after\n                    the marriage, he continued to receive rental and annuities\n                    totalling $2,600 (Foo Ah Yanat [3]). Lump sum\n                    maintenance of $126,000 ($1,500/mth x 12 x 7 years) was\n                    awarded to the wife. 74     Woo Bih Li J held inAMW v AMZat [9] that, as compared to\n                    the date of the ancillary order, the date of the writ is\n                    generally a better reference point for commencement of\n                    maintenance. This is however not a rigid rule; ultimately,\n                    the court should order maintenance to commence from the date\n                    which it considers, in its discretion, to be fair (AMW v AMZat [12]–[13]). I agree with\n                    Woo J’s observations, though I note that, unlike\n                    inAMW v AMZ, there is on the\n                    present facts an existing maintenance order, which the\n                    husband has failed to comply with for the last four years\n                    (see[63]above),\n                    although there is no indication that he cannot continue\n                    complying with it. 75     Taking into account all\n                    the circumstances – including (a) the wife’s old\n                    age (65), and therefore, low likelihood of remarrying; (b)\n                    the husband’s old age (66) and his current\n                    unemployment/retirement; (c) the proportion of matrimonial\n                    assets awarded to the wife; and (d) the current life\n                    expectancy of women (84.1) – none of which is\n                    determinative, in my judgment, a fair and reasonable\n                    multiplier would be six years comprising three years in\n                    arrears and three years of future maintenance, using the\n                    date of this judgment as a reference point (effectively,\n                    until the wife reaches 68 years of age). 76     In the circumstances, I\n                    award the wife a lump sum maintenance of $91,800, based on\n                    the following computation: (a)     Arrears as at\n                        date of hearing (3 years): Shortfall of $1250 per month\n                        x 12 x 3 years = $45,000. (b)     Future maintenance (3 years,\n                        until the wife is 68): $1,300 per month x 12 x 3 years =\n                        $46,800.",
        "Just and equitable division on the present\n                facts": "53     In light of all the\n                    circumstances – including (a) the wife’s\n                    substantial non-financial contributions to the family; (b)\n                    her 12% contribution to the purchase price of the Namly\n                    House (see[5]and[41]above); (c) her\n                    likely indirect financial contributions to the mortgage\n                    repayment using the Ghim Moh flat sale proceeds (see[42]above); (d)\n                    other outlays,eg, renovation\n                    fees (see[42]above);\n                    and (e) the length of the marriage and the general trend of\n                    awarding more to a wife of a long marriage (see[33]to[36]above) – it\n                    would, in my view, be just and equitable to award the wife\n                    50% of the pool of matrimonial assets, taking into account\n                    the adverse inference drawn against the husband for his\n                    failure to disclose all his assets. 54     In making my order for\n                    50:50 division, I am mindful that there is no\n                    “norm” or default position of equal division\n                    (seeLock Yeng Funat\n                        [50]–[57]). Courts have, however, not hesitated\n                    to award 50% or more to the wife where the facts so\n                    justified (seeLock Yeng Funat [58]). This is,\n                    in my view, an appropriate case for equal\n                division.",
        "The manner of division": "55     The court has a large\n                    measure of flexibility as to the actual order it chooses to\n                    make against any particular matrimonial asset within the\n                    pool of assets to be divided (seeHalsbury’svol 11at [130.770] and [130.836]). On\n                    the present facts, the most convenient and non-intrusive\n                    manner of apportioning the pool of matrimonial assets is for\n                    each party to retain their respective assets, and to split\n                    only the proceeds from the sale of the Namly House. This\n                    manner of splitting the matrimonial assets was the only\n                    common ground between the parties in the present case (see[11]above). 56     Of course, the\n                    apportionment of the Namly House sale proceeds will be based\n                    on my consideration of theentirepool of matrimonial assets (NK v NLat [38]–[40]). As I have assessed\n                    the common pool of assets to be worth $4,168,300 (see[29]above), a 50%\n                    share works out to $2,084,150. Taking the value of the Namly\n                    House to be $3.4 million, this would translate into about\n                    59.3% share of the Namly House in favour of the wife\n                    ([{2,084,150 – 67,500} / 3.4 million] x 100%), which I\n                    round up to 60%.",

The assessment of the\n                    appropriate lump sum figure isdiscretionaryin that there is an\n                    unavoidable element of speculation, especially when\n                    assessing the appropriate multiplier (see Professor Leong\n                    Wai Lum,Elements of Family\n                        Law(LexisNexis, 2007), at p 829).\n                    Ultimately, “it is the court’s sense of justice\n                    which demands and obtains a just solution to many a\n                    difficult issue” (seeBG v\n                        BF[2007] 3 SLR(R) 233 at [74]). 58     The legal principles\n                    relevant to the power under s 113 were recently discussed by\n                    the Court of Appeal inFoo Ah Yan v ChiamHeng Chow[2012] SGCA 15 (“Foo Ah\n                        Yan”). Briefly, the assessment of the\n                    appropriate monthly multiplicand begins with the\n                    wife’s financial needs as derived from her particulars\n                    of expenditure, scaled down for reasonableness. The\n                    overarching principle of financial preservation, as embodied\n                    in s 114(2) of the Act, requires the wife to be\n                    maintained at a standard, which is, to a reasonable extent,\n                    commensurate with the standard of living she had enjoyed\n                    during the marriage (Foo Ah\n                        Yanat [13]). This principle of financial\n                    preservation must be applied in a commonsense holistic\n                    manner, which takes into account the new realities flowing\n                    from the breakdown of the marriage. Therefore, where\n                    possible, the wife must exert reasonable efforts to help\n                    preserve her pre-breakdown lifestyle (seeFoo Ah Yanat [16]). 59     The court must also\n                    consider the husband’s financial ability to meet the\n                    maintenance order; although he isprima\n                        facieobliged to maintain his former wife\n                    beyond his retirement and up to the former wife’s\n                    remarriage or the death of either party, the former wife who\n                    has assets of her own should not expect a full subsidy for\n                    her lifestyle (seeFoo Ah Yanat [17]). 60     It has also been\n                    repeatedly stressed that there is no rigid rule in relation\n                    to the assessment of the appropriate multiplier – it\n                    depends on the particular facts (seeFoo\n                        Ah Yanat [18] andNg Ngah\n                        Lenat [13]). Ultimately, it is thereasonablenessof the maintenance\n                    claimvis-à-visthe\n                    husband’s ability to pay, which guides the\n                    court’s application of the principle of financial\n                    preservation (seeAQS v AQR[2012] SGCA 3 at [52] andFoo Ah\n                        Yanat [19]).",
        "Conclusion": "77     By reason of my findings,\n                    I make the following orders: (a)     A joint\n                        valuation of the Namly House to be conducted\n                        forthwith.

(c)     The net sale proceeds of the Namly\n                        House, less all expenses of the sale including the costs\n                        of the valuation, to be divided 60% in favour of the\n                        wife and the balance 40% in favour of the\n                        husband. (d)     Each party to refund their respective\n                        CPF contributions and accrued interest to their\n                        respective CPF accounts from their share of the net sale\n                        proceeds. (e)     The husband to pay the wife a lump\n                        sum maintenance of $91,800 to be deducted from the\n                        husband’s share of the net sale proceeds of the\n                        Namly House; (f)     The husband and the wife to retain\n                        their respective assets in their own\n                    names.
