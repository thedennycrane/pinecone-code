        "The proceedings giving rise\nto the contentious business agreements": "5       Chancery\nLaw’s application in OS 399/2014 comes on the back of a long-standing\ndispute between two rival factions of subsidiary proprietors at\na development managed by the MCST. I shall refer to the two factions\nas “the Mok faction” and “the Opposition faction”. At the time when\nthe dispute took root, the Mok faction had control of the MCST council.\nThe Opposition faction, on the other hand, possessed a majority\nin share value, allowing it to pass resolutions requiring a simple\nmajority at general meetings.",
        "S 311/2012": "6       On\n8 May 2012, the Opposition faction commenced S 311/2012 against\nMr Mok Wing Chong (“MWC”), a previous chairperson of the MCST council\nand a member of the Mok faction. 7       The\nclaim is for alleged breaches of MWC’s duties and misuse of the MCST’s\nfunds in relation to renovation works at the development. MWC issued\na third party notice in S 311/2012 and brought the MCST in as a third\nparty to the suit. 8       Chancery\nLaw acted for the MCST in S 311/2012. On 12 November 2012, the MCST\ncouncil, which was controlled by the Mok faction, unanimously resolved\nto appoint Chancery Law as its legal representatives in S 311/2012.\nMr Mok Wai Chung delivered a signed copy of Chancery Law’s standard\nletter of engagement and a warrant to act to Chancery Law on 19 November\n2012.[note: 1] 9       The\nOpposition faction was dissatisfied with this turn of events. It convened\nan extraordinary general (“EOGM”) meeting on 5 June 2013 and passed\nvarious motions by ordinary resolution. One of the motions, “Motion 2”,\nstipulated that “the appointment of [Chancery Law] as legal representatives\nof [the MCST was to] be terminated with immediate effect”.[note: 2]The\nthen-chairperson of the MCST council, Mr Mok Wai Hoe (“MWH”), who\nis MWC’s son, rejected the votes cast in favour of Motion 2 by the\nOpposition faction and some other subsidiary proprietors. MWH’s reason\nwas that the contested votes were cast by the voters when they were in\na position of conflict of interest.",
        "OS 569/2013": "10     About\nthree weeks later, on 26 June 2013, the Opposition faction filed OS 569/2013.\nThe respondents in OS 569/2013 were MWH and the MCST. The Opposition\nfaction prayed for an invalidation of MWH’s rejection of the contested\nvotes in favour of Motion 2, amongst other reliefs. 11     Chancery\nLaw acted for the MCST in OS 569/2013. On 3 July 2013, the MCST\ncouncil passed a resolution appointing Chancery Law as the MCST’s\nlegal representatives in OS 569/2013. On 17 July 2013, the MCST executed\nChancery Law’s terms of engagement and a warrant to act. The signed\ndocuments were delivered to Chancery Law on 24 July 2013 by hand.[note: 3] 12     On\n28 October 2013, a judge of the High Court gave judgment in OS 569/2013\n(the decision is reported atFu Loong Lithographer\nPte Ltd and others v Mok Wai Hoe and another[2014] 1\nSLR 218). The judge held that MWH was correct to reject the contested\nvotes on Motion 2. Allowing the Opposition faction to terminate\nthe appointment of Chancery Law as the MCST’s counsel in proceedings\nwhere the Opposition faction’s interests were adverse to those of\nthe MCST would effectively deny the MCST its right to be heard in\nS 311/2012. The judge accordingly validated MWH’s rejection of the\ncontested votes.",
        "CA 110/2013": "13     In\nCA 110/2013, the Opposition faction appealed against, amongst others,\nthe portion of the judge’s decision validating MWH’s rejection of the\nvotes cast in support of Motion 2. Chancery Law also acted for the MCST\nin the appeal. 14     The\nCourt of Appeal delivered its judgment on 23 May 2014 (the decision\nis reported atFu Loon Lithographer Pte Ltd\nand others v Mok Wai Hoe and another and another matter[2014]\n3 SLR 456). The Court of Appeal allowed the Opposition faction’s\nappeal on the Motion 2 point. The Court of Appeal held at[66]that MWH’s\nrejection of the contested votes on Motion 2 was invalid. The appeal\nwas allowed (at[65])\non the narrow ground that: [It was] difficult to see how a breach\nof the rules of natural justice would be occasioned if [the MCST]\nitself validly determines in a general meeting that its lawyers\nin [S 311/2012] should be discharged. The Court of Appeal did\nnot address the effect of its ruling on Chancery Law’s status as\nthe MCST’s legal representatives. 15     Chancery\nLaw has since ceased to be the solicitors on record for the MCST\nin S 311/2012, which is still ongoing. However, as noted earlier,\nthe exact point of Chancery Law’s termination is disputed. 16     The\nMCST’s position is that the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 110/2013\ninvalidated Chancery Law’s appointment retrospectively from 5 June\n2013,[note: 4]on\nthe basis that that was the date when Motion 2 was “deemed to have\nbeen carried”. Chancery Law’s position is that it ceased to be the\nMCST’s legal representatives only when its appointment was formally\nterminated by the MCST on 6 August 2014.[note: 5]This\nis the date when Chancery Law received an email from the MCST, informing\nChancery Law that its appointment as solicitors for the MCST in\nS 311/2012 had been terminated on the basis of votes taken at an\nEOGM on that day.[note: 6] 17     I\nnote also that Chancery Law asserts that it received a letter from solicitors\nacting on behalf of the Opposition faction in S 311/2012 on 7 July 2014.\nThe letter referred to the Court of Appeal’s decision in CA 110/2013 and\nexplained that the Opposition faction had made a requisition for\nan EOGMto consider terminationof\nChancery Law’s appointment and their replacement.[note: 7]It appears that the EOGM\nwas held on 6 August 2014. Prior to 6 August 2014, Chancery Law\nasserts that it had not received any instructions from the MCST\nterminating its (Chancery Law’s) retainer. It is apparent that the\nOpposition faction (through their lawyers) at this point in time\nwas also taking the position that termination of the retainer had\nto be considered as a result of the Court of Appeal decision.",
        "The proceedings in OS 399/2014": "18     It\nappears that subsequent to those events described above, the Opposition\nfaction has come to be in control of the MCST. The MCST now refuses\nto pay Chancery Law’s fees. 19     Chancery\nLaw commenced OS 399/2014 against the MCST for the enforcement of\ncontentious business agreements relating to S 311/2012, OS 569/2013\nand CA 110/2013. 20     It\nis established law that an agreement will only be a contentious business\nagreement within s 111 of the LPA if it is specific in terms and signed\nby the client (this is considered in greater detail below at[40]). I note, however,\nthe rather peculiar nature of the contentious business agreements\nbefore me. The contentious business agreements are said to arise\nfrom clauses in Chancery Law’s letters of engagement for S 311/2012 and\nOS 569/2013, both of which state:[note: 8] If you have not asked us to tax our bill/[statement\nof charges] pursuant to clause 26, and do not pay our bill/[statement\nof charges] within 21 days of its receipt,the\nbill/[statement of charges]in question\nshall then be deemed to be an agreed costs bill/[statement\nof charges],pursuant to...s. 111(in respect of contentious business)\nof the Legal Profession Act ... Further, if you continue to instruct\nus to carry out work or accept our work product after 14 days of the\nreceipt of a bill/[statement of charges], this act shall be taken\nas your unconditional acceptance (in principle and in quantum) of\nthat bill/[statement of charges] and all bills/[statement of charges]\nrendered previously. If this is not the case, please inform us in\nwriting immediately. [emphasis added] These clauses are peculiar\nin that the contentious business agreement is deemed to arise from\nthe client’s non-response to a bill or statement of charges issued\nby the solicitors. However, since the parties have proceeded on\nthe basis that s 111 is applicable, I will proceed on the assumption\nthat these are contentious business agreements within the meaning\nof s 111. 21     In\nOS 399/2014, the grounds on which the MCST refuses to pay the legal\nfees include the assertion that Chancery Law pursued the interests\nof the Council Members or the Mok faction instead of those of the\nMCST in all the proceedings mentioned above. The details are set\nout in Ms Tay Lay Suan’s affidavit dated 24 July 2014 filed in OS 399/2014.\nMs Tay is a manager with one of the subsidiary proprietors from\nthe Opposition faction. 22     The\nMCST resists payment of Chancery Law’s fees for S 311/2012 on the\nfollowing grounds.[note: 9] (a)     Three\nof the four bills issued by Chancery Law relate to work done between\n4 and 21 February 2014. These fees were incurred in respect of work\ndone after the termination of Chancery Law’s warrant to act by the\nMCST on 5 June 2013. The fourth bill covered the period from 8 November\n2012 up to 3 February 2014. Work done after 5 June 2013 was undertaken\nafter termination of the warrant to act. (b)     Chancery\nLaw did not act in the interest of the MCST in S 311/2012, but rather,\nacted in a manner that preferred the interests of the Mok faction;\nand (c)     Chancery\nLaw’s fees are manifestly excessive. In the alternative, the\nMCST asserts that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution\nfrom the Council Members. 23     The\nMCST resists payment of Chancery Law’s fees for OS 569/2013 and\nCA 110/2013 on the basis that:[note: 10] (a)     Chancery\nLaw acted in OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013 in a position of conflict\nof interest; and (b)     Chancery\nLaw could have taken a completely neutral position in the proceedings\nwithout compromising the MCST’s position. Instead, Chancery Law\npursued a rigorous defence in OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013. In the alternative, the\nMCST asserts that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution\nfrom the Council Members. 24     The\nMCST filed Summons No 4368 of 2014 for leave to issue a third party\nnotice against eight Council Members. In the third party notice,\nthe MCST seeks an indemnity and/or a contribution from the Council Members\non the basis that they acted in excess of power or authority by appointing\nChancery Law. 25     The\nMCST relies on resolutions purportedly passed at its EOGMs dated\n6 October 2010 and 12 December 2012. In the former, the MCST was only\nauthorised to incur legal fees up to a limit of $500. In the latter,\nit was mandated that any expenditure exceeding $2,000 had to be\napproved at a general meeting of the MCST. The MCST argues that\nthe effect of these resolutions is that the Council Members did\nnot have the power or authority to appoint Chancery Law as the legal\nrepresentatives of the MCST. In doing so, the Council Members have\nacted in breach of their duties, in bad faith, and in abuse of their\nposition. 26     I\npause to mention that prior to the issuance of the third party notice, the\n6 October 2010 and 12 December 2012 meetings and resolutions were not\nraised or mentioned in Ms Tay’s affidavits filed in OS 399/2014. Ms Tay’s\naffidavits also never previously mentioned that the MCST council did\nnot have the authority to appoint Chancery Law because of restrictions placed\non the MCST council by resolutions made at the MCST’s general meetings.[note: 11]",
        "The issue and the arguments": "27     The\nsole issue before me is whether leave should be granted for the MCST\nto issue the third party notice against the Council Members in OS 399/2014. 28     Chancery\nLaw argues that leave should not be granted. The first point made\nis that a law firm cannot sue on a contentious business agreement.[note: 12]The only way to enforce\nsuch an agreement is by commencing an originating summons, and by\nsatisfying the “fair and reasonable” test. Chancery Law argues that\nthe inquiry is a narrow one: first, is there a contentious business\nagreement; and second, is it fair and reasonable between the parties?[note: 13] 29     Chancery\nLaw argues that whether or not the Council Members had authority\nto appoint Chancery Law is “an indoor management issue that does\nnot concern [Chancery Law]”.[note: 14]The\nissues are distinct, and the Council Members should not be joined\nas third parties. 30     Chancery\nLaw also argues that proceedings under s 113 of the LPA are “equivalent\nto a taxation proceeding”.[note: 15]Both\nproceedings are in the context of solicitor-and-client costs. In\nboth proceedings, the court considers the nature of the work done\nand the value to be placed on it. The “only distinction” is that\nthe court need not assess “solicitor-and-client costs at a fixed\nfigure”.[note: 16] 31     Chancery\nLaw relies on cases which show that at a taxation hearing, the fact\nthat the solicitors may have been negligent, or may have acted in breach\nof duty is irrelevant:Re Massey and Carey(1884)\n26 Ch D 459;Abrahams and another v Wainwright\nRyan[1998] VSC 335; andNicholas Drukker\n& Co v Pridie Brewster & Co[2006] 3 Costs LR\n439. Chancery Law states that the substance of the MCST’s allegation\nis that Chancery Law acted negligently or in breach of duty. Chancery\nLaw’s case is that this is irrelevant to proceedings under s 113\nof the LPA, where all the court is concerned with is the fairness\nor reasonableness of the contentious business agreement. 32     The\nMCST’s submissions on leave for the issuance of the third party notice\nare scant, and do not add anything to their position taken in OS 399/2014\ndescribed at[21]–[24]above. 33     It\nis apparent that many of the submissions raised by the parties before\nme cover thesubstantivepositions\nwhich they intend to take at the hearing of OS 399/2014, rather\nthan the question of whether leave should be granted for the MCST\nto issue a third party notice against the Council Members. I will\nonly address the arguments in so far as they are relevant to the\napplication before me.",
        "Analysis and decision": "34     Before\nconsidering whether leave to issue the third party notice should\nbe granted, it will be helpful to consider two points. First, the\nnature of an application to enforce a contentious business agreement\nunder the LPA. Second, the purpose of the third party proceedings\nprovisions under O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014\nRev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). I begin with the nature of proceedings\nunder s 113 of the LPA.",
        "The nature of an application\nto enforce a contentious business agreement under the LPA": "35     Section 111\nof the LPA permits a solicitor to enter into contentious business\nagreements with his client. Section 111 states: 111.­—(1)\n Subject to the provisions of any other written law, a solicitor\nor a law corporation or a limited liability law partnership may\nmake an agreement in writing with any client respecting the amount\nand manner of payment for the whole or any part of its costs in\nrespect of contentious business done or to be done by the solicitor\nor the law corporation or the limited liability law partnership,\neither by a gross sum or otherwise, and at either the same rate\nas or a greater or a lesser rate than that at which he or the law\ncorporation or the limited liability law partnership would otherwise\nbe entitled to be remunerated. (2)    Every\nsuch agreement shall be signed by the client and shall be subject to\nthe provisions and conditions contained in this Part. 36     InSports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law Corp and another[2010]\n4 SLR 590, Steven Chong J said at[13]that this provision entitles\na solicitor and client to agree to a higher rate of costs than what\nthe solicitor would usually charge. Chong J stated that the enforceability\nof such agreements is nonetheless subject to the “fair and reasonable”\nrequirement in s 113 of the LPA, which I shall come to in a moment. 37     More\nrecently, the court of three judges inLaw\nSociety of Singapore v Tay Choon Leng John[2012] 3 SLR\n150 held at[23]that\ns 111 of the LPA is a permissive rather than mandatory provision.\nThe court adopted at[32]the\ncomments of Professor Tan Yock Lin inThe Law\nof Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore and West Malaysia(Butterworths\nAsia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at p 685: Section 111 hasnothing\nto do with validity but is concerned only with enforceability by\nthe solicitor. Being an empowering section, it does not\naffect the position of a client who sets up an agreement as to costs.\nBefore the enactment of section 111, a client could enforce an oral\nagreement as to costs against his solicitor and that remains true\nafter the enactment. Thus inClare v Joseph,\nin an action brought to recover moneys received by a solicitor to\nthe use of his client, the English Court of Appeal held that the\nclient continued to be entitled, despite the enactment of the English\nequivalent of section 111, to set up an oral agreement by the solicitor\nto be paid less than usual costs. However, where a solicitor purports\nto set up an agreement as to costs, the agreement must be in writing\nfor it to be enforceable. [emphasis added] 38     Also\nintegral to the working of the statutory scheme for contentious business\nagreements is s 113, which is the section under which Chancery Law’s\napplication is made. Section 113 states: 113.­—(1)No action or suit shall be brought or instituted\nupon any such agreement as is referred to in section 111. (2)    Every\nquestion respecting thevalidity or effectof\nthe agreement may be examined and determined, and the agreement\nmay be enforced or set aside without suit or action on the application\nby originating summons of any person or the representatives of any\nperson, party to the agreement, or being or alleged to be liable\nto pay, or being or claiming to be entitled to be paid the costs,\nfees, charges or disbursements in respect of which the agreement\nis made, by the court in which the business or any part thereof\nwas done or a Judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in\nany court, then by the High Court or a Judge thereof. (3)    Upon any such application, if it appears\nto the court or Judge that the agreement is in all respects fair\nand reasonable between the parties, it may be enforced by the court\nor Judge by rule or order, in such manner and subject to such conditions\n(if any) as to the costs of the application as the court or Judge\nthinks fit. (4)    If theterms\nof the agreement are deemed by the court or Judge to be unfair or\nunreasonable, the agreement may be declared void. ... [emphasis added] 39     An\napplication to enforce a contentious business agreement must be made\nby originating summons under s 113(2) of the LPA. In an application to\nenforce a contentious business agreement under s 113, the court\nis concerned with three questions: form, validity and effect. 40     The\nfirst preliminary question is whether the agreement satisfies theformal requirementsof a contentious business\nagreement in s 111 of the LPA. These include the need for the agreement\nto be in writing (s 111(1) of the LPA) and signed by the client\n(s 111(2) of the LPA). There is also a need for sufficient certainty\nor specificity of the terms governing the fees:Shamsudin\nbin Embun v P T Seah & Co[1985–1986] SLR(R) 1108 (“Shamsudin v Seah”) at[22], citing the\nEnglish Court of Appeal decision ofChamberlain\nv Boodle & King[1982] 3 All ER 188 at 191a. Only agreements satisfying the requirements\nin s 111 fall within the remit of s 113 of the LPA. 41     The\nsecond question concerns the contractualvalidityof\nthe contentious business agreement. It will only be enforced “in\nthe absence of there being any vitiating factors”:Wee\nSoon Kim Anthony v Chor Pee & Partners[2006] 1 SLR(R)\n518 at[26].\nInShamsudin v Seah, Chan Sek Keong JC\n(as he then was) resolved a plea ofnon est\nfactumin determining whether to enforce a contentious\nbusiness agreement under s 113 of the LPA. 42     The\nthird question concerns theeffectof\nthe agreement. This is underpinned by the principle stated by Andrew\nPhang Boon Leong JC (as he then was) inWong\nFoong Chai v Lin Kuo Hao[2005] 3 SLR(R) 74 at[31]that: [N]o agreement for the payment of costs\nbetween client and solicitor is sacrosanct in the sense that it\nis conclusive and immune to, as well as impervious from, any investigation\nby the court itself. Even if the contentious\nbusiness agreement overcomes the hurdles of form and validity, the\ncourt must be satisfied that the terms of the agreement are fair\nand reasonable before the court will enforce it: ss 113(3) and 113(4)\nof the LPA. 43     This\nis a convenient point to deal with Chancery Law’s submission that\nan application under s 113 of the LPA is “equivalent to a taxation proceeding”.[note: 17]The\ndiscussion above shows that the court is not concerned only with\n“the nature of the work done and the value to be placed on it” as\nis the case in taxation proceedings. Proceedings under s 113 of\nthe LPA are broader than that. They may necessitate an examination\nof the circumstances under which the agreement is formed to determine\nwhether it was validly entered into and whether the terms of the\nbargain were fairly struck and reasonable: seeIn\nre Stuart, ex parte Cathcart[1893] 2 QB 201 (“In re Stuart”) at 205, cited with approval\ninShamsudin v Seahat[31]. Indeed, inIn re Stuart, the English Court of Appeal\nnoted in passing arguments that the agreement under consideration\nwas void as against public policy (on the grounds of champerty).\nI therefore reject this submission of Chancery Law. 44     I\nrecognise, however, that an application under s 113 of the LPA is usually\n“dealt with in a summary manner”:Shamsudin\nv Seahat[3].\nIt is commenced by originating summons and not by writ (indeed,\ns 113(1) of the LPA prohibits a suit on a contentious business agreement).\nThere may, however, be a need for the court to take oral testimony\nto resolve the narrow issue of the circumstances under which the\ncontentious business agreement was entered into. This was done inShamsudin v Seah, in relation to a plea\nofnon est factumby the client.",
        "The purpose of third party proceedings": "45     The\nprovisions governing the issuance of a third party notice are found\nin O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court. The defendant in a proceeding\nmay issue a third party notice in three situations. First, where\nhe seeks a contribution or indemnity from a person who is not a\nparty to the action: O 16 r 1(1)(a).\nSecond, where he seeks relief relating to the original subject-matter\nof the action or seeks relief substantially similar to relief claimed\nby the plaintiff: O 16 r 1(1)(b).\nThird, where any issue relating to the original subject-matter of\nthe action should be determined between a person not already party\nto the action: O 16 r 1(1)(c). The\nMCST relies on all three grounds to join the Council Members as\nthird parties to OS 399/2014.[note: 18]The\nlearned assistant registrar granted leave on the basis that the\nMCST was seeking an indemnity or contribution, and because the factual\nbases upon which the liability to indemnify arose were (in his view)\nrelated to the validity of the agreement and the limits of the MCST\ncouncil’s authority. 46     In\nthe present case, pursuant to O 16 r 1(2) of the Rules of Court, leave\nof court is required to issue the third party notice since the proceedings\nwere commenced by originating summons. Order 16 r 2 of the Rules\nof Court sets out the procedure governing leave applications. Jeffrey Pinsler SC,Singapore Court Practice 2014(Lexis Nexis,\n2014) (“Singapore Court Practice”)\nexplains at paragraph 16/2/5 that the court enjoys a general discretion\nin all cases whether or not to allow the issuance of a third party notice.\nI note in passing that in cases where a third party notice can be issued\nwithout leave, any objections by the plaintiff or the third party\nare considered at the hearing of the defendant’s summons for third\nparty directions:Singapore Court Practiceat\nparagraph 16/4/5.  Factors relevant to the exercise of the court’s\ndiscretion are considered below at[51]. 47     Regardless\nof which limb of O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court is relied on, the\nobjective of third party proceedings is twofold:Singapore\nCourt Practiceat paragraph 16/1/1. First, to enable\nparties to raise all issues relating to the subject-matter of the\nhearing in one set of proceedings. This avoids delay and unnecessary\ncosts resulting from multiple actions. The second related objective\nis to avoid inconsistency between judicial decisions if common issues\nare litigated in separate proceedings.",
        "Whether leave should be granted\nfor the MCST to issue the third party notice": "48     In\nits third party notice (see[24]–[26]above), the\nMCST pleads that it is entitled to an indemnity and/or a contribution\nfrom the Council Members who appointed Chancery Law as its legal\nrepresentatives. The third party notice was filed on 18 September\n2014. Shortly after, the learned assistant registrar granted the\nleave that is now being appealed. 49     The\nlearned assistant registrar’s decision was based primarily on the assessment\nthat the MCST’s claim fell within the contribution or indemnity ground\narticulated in O 16 r 1(1)(a) of\nthe Rules of Court. The learned assistant registrar may also have\nbeen of the view that O 16 r 1(1)(c) applied,\ngiven his holding that the factual bases of the indemnity claim\nwere related to the validity of the agreement. 50     Before\nI set out my reasons for deciding that leave should not have been\ngiven for the MCST to issue the third party notice, I should note\nthat neither party in the submissions touched on the question of\nlaw as to when a right to an indemnity arises, particularly between\nthe MCST and the Council Members. This is understandable given that\nat this stage, what is in issue is whether aprima\nfaciecase has been made that the matter falls with a limb\nof O 16 r 1 of the Rules of Court. It is not necessary to go into\nthe substantive merits as such. Nevertheless, I mention in passing\nthat inSingapore Civil Procedureat\nparagraph 16/1/3, it is stated that the right to an indemnity can\nbe based on a principle of law or equity. Cases where the right\nhas been recognised include a situation where the third party was\nthe managing director of the defendant-company, and his breach of\nduty to the company caused losses:Eastern\nShipping Co v Quah Beng Kee[1924] AC 177, cited inGoh Sin Huat Electrical Pte Ltd v Ho See Jui (trading\nas Xuanhua Art Gallery) and another[2012] 3 SLR 1038.\nHowever, even if there is aprima faciebasis\nfor the claim to an indemnity, it is my view that leave should not\nbe granted. 51     The\ncourt has the discretion to set aside, or to refuse to grant leave\nto issue a third party notice, where there may be nothing to be\ngained from determining all matters at once (Singapore\nCourt Practiceat paragraph 16/4/4), or where the plaintiff\nwould “be embarrassed by the desire of the defendants to have the\nwhole question of [the third party’s] liability decided at once”\n(Carshore v North Eastern Railway Company(1885)\n29 Ch D 344 at 346). In cases where the defendant needs leave to issue\na third party notice, as in the present case, it does not follow\nthat leave must be granted whenever aprima\nfaciecase is made out which would bring the matter within\nany limb of O 16 r 1(1). The court retains the discretion to refuse\nleave in the circumstances outlined above:Singapore Court\nPracticeat paragraph 16/2/5. 52     InBower v Hartley and another(1876) 1 QB\n652, the defendant insurance brokers were approached by the plaintiff\nshipper to effect insurance for cargoes that the plaintiff was shipping\nabroad. The cargoes were lost at sea but the underwriters refused\nto make payment to the plaintiff. The plaintiff brought a claim\nagainst the defendants in negligence. The defendants issued a third\nparty notice to join a second insurance broker (“Leyland & Co”).\nThe defendants’ position was that they effected one of the insurance\npolicies through Leyland & Co and the latter was responsible for\nindemnifying the former. The plaintiff resisted the joining of Leyland\n& Co as a third party. 53     The\nEnglish Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the Queen’s Bench\nDivision to set aside the third party notice. Mellish LJ took into account\nthe fact that the defendant’s claim against Leyland & Co “would\nbe distinct” (at 657) from the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant.\nThe issue of negligence between the plaintiff and the defendant\nwas distinct from the negligence between the defendant and third\nparty. He also said that the inclusion of Leyland & Co might\ndelay the trial. Mellish LJ concluded that the court should exercise\nits discretion to refuse to make the order to serve the third parties.\nJames LJ also said at 656 that “the convenience of having this question\ndetermined once for all in this action is not enough to outweigh\nthe injury to the plaintiff which may result from the introduction of\nthe third party”. 54     It\nis my view that to allow the third party notice to be issued in\nthis case will cause substantial prejudice to Chancery Law. Further,\nthere would be little to be gained from determining all at once\nChancery Law’s claim for fees under the agreement and the MCST’s\nclaim for an indemnity against the Council Members. 55     Joining\nthe Council Members as third parties would deprive Chancery Law\nof what is in essence a summary procedure for a solicitor to enforce\na contentious business agreement against his client. The enforcement\nof a contentious business agreement hangs on the resolution of the\nthree narrow questions of form, validity and effect discussed above. Proceedings\nunder s 113 of the LPA are commenced by originating summons. The\nprovisions do not envisage the resolution of substantial disputes\nof fact. 56     The\nissue of whether the Council Members had authority to appoint Chancery\nLaw, on the other hand, raises disputed factual and legal questions.\nChancery Law will be put through the expense of having to participate\nin a factually intensive dispute with little relation, if any at\nall, to Chancery Law’s claim for fees. Further, an action commenced\nby originating summons is a blunt tool to resolve contested facts.\nA conversion of OS 399/2013 to a writ action is not possible because\ns 113(1) of the LPA prohibits a contentious business agreement from\nbeing the subject of a suit. 57     While\noral evidence can be heard in cases commenced by originating summons,\nthis is not the norm. The fact that Parliament saw fit to mandate that\nproceedings under s 113 of the LPA must be by way of originating summons\nsupports the view that a summary procedure is intended.Shamsudin v Seah, referred to earlier,\nwas a case where the court heard oral evidence on the issue of whether\nthe client understood the nature of the contentious fee agreement\nin the context of his assertion that the agreement was void fornon est factum.Shamsudin\nv Seahwas not a case where third party proceedings were\nin issue. 58     It\nalso seems to me that there is little to be gained from resolving\nthe issue of the Council Members’ authority to engage Chancery Law\n(and therefore whether the MCST is entitled to an indemnity from\nthem for Chancery Law’s fees) together with whether Chancery Law\nshould be entitled to enforce the contentious business agreements\nagainst the MCST. There is no suggestion in Ms Tay’s affidavit that\nChancery Law had actual or constructive notice of the Council Members’\nalleged lack of authority, which would have affected the validity\nof Chancery Law’s retainer. 59     Chancery\nLaw relies on letters of engagement and warrants to act that were\nsigned in accordance with and pursuant to what appeared to be valid resolutions\nof the MCST’s council. It may be said (without deciding) that the\nMCST council had, at the very least, apparent or ostensible authority\nto engage Chancery Law. At the substantive hearing of OS 399/2014,\nthe issues to be decided between Chancery Law and the MCST are:\n(a) whether the contentious business agreements are valid (in particular\nwhether Chancery Law can rely on the apparent or ostensible authority);\n(b) whether the agreement is fair; and (c) whether the terms are\nreasonable. Issues as to whether the fees are excessive or whether\nChancery Law did not act in the best interests of the MCST,etc, are relevant to (b) and (c). But\nthose matters are not before me and must ultimately be resolved\nat the substantive hearing of OS 399/2014. 60     The\nissue of whether the Council Members had actual authority when they\nappointed Chancery Law and whether they had breached any duty owed\nto the MCST is a distinct question from Chancery Law’s application under\ns 113 of the LPA. There is no need for them to be resolved together. 61     In\ncoming to this decision, I have noted the comment of the Court of Appeal\ninCIMB Bank Bhd v Dresdner Kleinwort Ltd[2008]\n4 SLR(R) 543 (“CIMB Bank v Dresdner Kleinwort”)\nat [82] that: We must emphasise, and this seemed to have\nbeen overlooked by CIMB, that the real test to determine whether\na third-party action should be heard together with the main action\nis not that of connection alone but whether they are inextricably\nlinked and the third party action is an integral and inseparable\npart of the main action … 62     I\naccept that the Court of Appeal’s remarks inCIMB\nBank v Dresdner Kleinwortappear to relate only to O 16\nr 1(1)(b) and (c)\nof the Rules of                                                \n             Court (there did not appear to be any issue of indemnity\nand/or contribution before the Court of Appeal in that case). 63     Nevertheless,\nthese comments are of some relevance given that the MCST relies\non all the limbs of O 16 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court.  Further, whilst\nthe learned assistant registrar decided the application primarily\non the basis of the indemnity claim, it appears that he also accepted\nthe applicability of the limb in O 16 r 1(1)(c). 64     It\nwill be recalled that the position taken by the MCST in resisting payment\nof Chancery Law’s fees for S 311/2012 is rooted in the claim that much\nof the work claimed in the four bills rendered by Chancery Law (see[22]above) related\nto work done after Chancery Law’s warrant to act had been terminated\non 5 June 2013.[note: 19]Leaving\naside the apparent inconsistency between this and the position taken\nby the Opposition faction in their lawyer’s letter referred to at[17]above, Chancery\nLaw’s position is that as a matter of law, their appointment was\nonly terminated on 6 August 2014. The question as to when Chancery\nLaw’s appointment was terminated is indeed a matter of law. The\npossible dates are 5 June 2013, 23 May 2014 (the date when the Court\nof Appeal allowed the Opposition faction’s appeal in CA 110/2013)\nor 6 August 2014. This is quite different from the main issue raised\nin the third party proceedings against the Council Members: namely\nthat they had appointed Chancery Law in breach of the resolutions. 65     The\nother grounds of attack relied on by the MCST in resisting fees for\nS 311/2012 is the allegation that Chancery Law did not act in the\ninterest of the MCST in S 311/2012, and that the fees are manifestly\nexcessive. The latter bears no connection with the claim against\nthe third party. The former is only loosely connected with the third\nparty claim. 66     The\nposition taken by the MCST in resisting payment of Chancery Law’s\nfees for OS 569/2013 and CA 110/2013[note: 20]rests\non the assertion that Chancery Law acted in a position of conflict\nof interest. In addition, it is claimed that Chancery Law could\nhave taken a completely neutral position in the proceedings without\ncompromising the MCST’s position. In my view, there are no good\nreasons for these issues and the third party claim to be resolved\nin the same set of proceedings. 67     In\nthe circumstances, leave to issue the third party notice should\nnot have been granted. The third party notice is set aside. I will\nhear the parties on costs.  [note: 1]Tan\nTian Luh’s 1st Affidavit for the applicant, Chancery Law, at paragraphs 9–11.
