        "Introduction": "1       This case concerns a caveat (“the\n                    Caveat”) lodged by the Defendant moneylender on a property (“the\n                    Property”) held by the Plaintiff and her ex-husband (“Zam”)\n                    as joint tenants. The Caveat was lodged to secure the Defendant’s interest\n                    in the sale proceeds of the Property to repay a loan that Zam obtained from the\n                    Defendant. The Plaintiff claims that she did not consent to the lodgement of the\n                    Caveat on the Property and is applying for it to be removed. As will be seen,\n                    this case raises some interesting and difficult issues of land law, in\n                    particular, the law in relation to caveats.",
        "Facts": "2       The Plaintiff and Zam were married on 24\n                    November 1995 and divorced on 6 December 2012. 3       The Defendant is a licensed moneylender under\n                    the Moneylenders Act (Cap 188, 2010 Rev Ed) (“the\n                MLA”). 4       The rest of the facts are disputed. I will\n                    therefore present both the Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s accounts\n                    separately.",
        "The Defendant’s account": "5       On 24 September 2009, Zam approached the\n                    Defendant to borrow $2,000 for the Hari Raya festive season. He filled up the\n                    loan application form and submitted copies of the supporting documents required,\n                    such as his identification card and recent payslips. The Defendant then informed\n                    Zam that his loan application was approved for the sum of $1,000 and asked him\n                    return with the Plaintiff to sign the loan documents. 6       Zam then returned with the Plaintiff to the\n                    Defendant’s premises on 26 September 2009. There, Zam signed various\n                    documents including a contract stating that he was borrowing $1,000 at an\n                    interest rate of 297% per annum. Paragraph 6 of the notes to the contract\n                    (“the Notes to the Contract”) provided as follows: 6)    A caveat will be lodged under the borrower’s\n                            property if the payment is not prompt and at anytime at the sole\n                            discretion of [the Defendant]. And will be removed upon completion of\n                            Loan payment. 7       Further, both Zam and the Plaintiff signed a\n                    document authorising and consenting to the lodgement of a caveat by the\n                    Defendant on the Property (“the 1st ACLC”). The Defendant tendered\n                    a copy of the 1st ACLC bearing what purports to be Zam’s and the\n                    Plaintiff’s signatures. The pertinent part of the 1st ACLC states as\n                    follows: Dear Sirs AUTHORISATION AND CONSENT TO LODGEMENT OF CAVEAT BY THE\n                            CAVEATOR ON [THE PROPERTY] … I/We, the undersigned, as the Registered Proprietor of the above\n                        property:- 1.    hereby wholly, unconditionally and irrevocably\n                            direct, authorize and consent to the Caveator lodging a Caveat\n                            on/against the Property to secure the Caveator’s interest in the\n                            sale proceeds of the Property to fully repay all loans granted or to be\n                            granted by the Caveator to me from time to time; 2.    Hereby wholly, unconditionally and irrevocably\n                            direct, authorize and consent to the Registrar to allow the lodgement of\n                            a Caveat by the Caveator on/against the Property; 3.    Hereby agree to indemnify you and your successors\n                            and assigns and hold you and/or your successors and assigns harmless\n                            against all actions, claims demands [sic],\n                            costs and expenses which may be brought against or suffered by you\n                            and/or your successors and assigns as a result of my said authorization,\n                            direction and consent. … 8       On 21 October 2009, Zam approached the Defendant\n                    again to borrow another $1,000. As Zam had been making prompt repayments of the\n                    26 September 2009 loan (“the 1st Loan”), the Defendant agreed to\n                    grant Zam a further loan of $1,000 (“the 2nd Loan”). The 2nd Loan\n                    was advanced on the same terms as the 1st Loan (apart from the schedule for\n                    repayment) save that this time, by the Defendant’s own admission, it did\n                    not ask for or obtain the Plaintiff’s authorisation and consent to the\n                    lodgement of a caveat on the Property. The caveat authorisation document for the\n                    2nd Loan (“the 2nd ACLC”) only bears Zam’s\n                signature. 9       Zam fully repaid the 1st Loan promptly. However,\n                    he was imprisoned for drug offences shortly after he obtained the 2nd Loan and\n                    failed to repay any part thereof despite repeated reminders (as of 23 January\n                    2014, the outstanding sum he owed to the Defendant, including principal,\n                    interest and late fees, was $28,334.19). On 19 November 2009, the Defendant took\n                    out the Caveat on the Property stating the following ground of claim: Persuant [sic] to a Loan Application (The\n                        Moneylenders Act 2009, Cap 188) dated 21 October 2009 made between the\n                        Registered Proprietor and the Caveator and the Registered Proprietor agreed\n                        to pay and settle all debts owing to the Caveator from the proceeds of sale\n                        of the land above described. Pending the sale of the land above described,\n                        the Registered Proprietor have agreed and consented to the lodgement of this\n                        Caveat to secure the Caveator’s interest in the proceeds of the sale\n                        of the land above described, thereby creating an equitable interest.",
        "The Plaintiff’s account": "10     On 6 December 2012, the Plaintiff obtained a\n                    divorce from the Syariah Court. The Syariah Court ordered,inter alia, that the Property be transferred to the Plaintiff,\n                    with no refunds to be made to the Defendant’s Central Provident Fund\n                    account (“the Syariah Court Order”). The Plaintiff then filed a\n                    transfer application with the Housing Development Board (“HDB”),\n                    whereupon she was informed by the HDB that the Property could not be transferred\n                    until the Caveat was removed. According to the Plaintiff, this was the first\n                    time she discovered the existence of the Caveat. She denies ever accompanying\n                    Zam to the Defendant’s premises to apply for a loan, and says that the\n                    signature on the 1st ACLC is not hers. 11     In addition, Zam affirmed a statutory\n                    declaration on 27 November 2013 (which the Plaintiff exhibited to her affidavit)\n                    stating that he approached the Defendant for a loan of $1,000 “[s]ometime\n                    in 2009”. He was handed a one-page loan document which referred only to\n                    the fact of the loan and the terms of repayment; there was no mention at all\n                    that the loan would be paid from the sale proceeds from the Property or that a\n                    caveat would be lodged against the Property. Zam duly paid three instalments of\n                    the loan and defaulted on the balance payment.",
        "The parties’ arguments": "12     The Plaintiff submits that the Caveat should\n                    be removed on the following grounds: (a)     the Caveat is defective because it\n                        failed to identify the particulars of the estate or interest claimed by the\n                        Defendant, as required by s 115(1)(c) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004\n                        Rev Ed) (“the LTA”); (b)     there was no consent from both the Plaintiff and Zam to\n                        the lodgement of the Caveat by the Defendant; (c)     even if there was such consent, it did not\n                        create an “interest in land” within the meaning of s 115(1) of\n                        the LTA entitling the Defendant to lodge the Caveat; and (d)     in any event, any agreement to use the\n                        Property or its sale proceeds as security or collateral for Zam’s debt\n                        is void pursuant to s 51(1) of the Housing and Development Act (Cap\n                        129, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the HDA”). I should note that the Plaintiff isnotarguing that the interest rate charged by the Defendant is\n                    excessive under s 23 of the MLA. 13     For its part, the Defendant contends that by\n                    signing the 1st ACLC on 26 September 2009, Zam and the Plaintiff had given it an\n                    interest in the proceeds of the sale of the Property, which constitutes an\n                    “interest in land” entitling the Defendant to lodge the Caveat.\n                    Although the Plaintiff did not sign the 2nd ACLC, the two loans should be seen\n                    as one transaction. In the alternative, Zam’s consent alone was sufficient\n                    to confer on the Defendant an interest in the sale proceeds of the Property\n                    under the concept of joint tenancy.",
        "My decision": "",
        "The factual issues and their significance": "14     There is a factual dispute between the parties\n                    on whether Zam and the Plaintiff had agreed to the Caveat being lodged on the\n                    Property in the event of Zam’s default. On the evidence before me, I\n                    consider the Defendant’s account to be far more credible. The Defendant\n                    has tendered a copy of the 1st ACLC bearing what appears to be Zam’s and\n                    the Plaintiff’s signature, as well as a copy of the 2nd ACLC bearing\n                    Zam’s signature. On the other hand, the Plaintiff has simply issued a bare\n                    denial that she signed the 1st ACLC and has failed to prove that the signature\n                    purporting to be hers on the 1st ACLC is a forgery, which she could easily have\n                    done by tendering copies of other official documents bearing her actual\n                    signature. 15     I also disbelieve the Plaintiff’s claim\n                    that she only became aware of the Caveat when she attempted to effect the\n                    transfer of the Property. Under s 117 of the LTA, the Registrar of Titles\n                    (“the Registrar”) is required to notify the caveatee whenever a\n                    caveat has been lodged and accepted by the Registrar. The Defendant has tendered\n                    evidence of a letter from the Registrar stating that notice of the Caveat was\n                    sent by post to the address of the Property on 3 December 2009. In response, the\n                    Plaintiff could only say that she did not receive the said letter. 16     As for the account of facts contained in\n                    Zam’s statutory declaration, I find it to be inconsistent with the\n                    documentary evidence and place no weight on it. Zam makes no mention of the fact\n                    that he took out two loans, and claims that he was only given a one-page loan\n                    document to sign. However, the Defendant has tendered copies of the loan\n                    documents evidencing both the 1st Loan and the 2nd Loan. The documents for each\n                    loan numbered about 8–10 pages, and each page bore Zam’s signature\n                    and thumbprint (with the exception of the ACLCs, which bore his signature but\n                    not his thumbprint). There is no indication that these documents are anything\n                    but genuine, and it would indeed be quite preposterous for the Defendant to\n                    resort to falsifying them and forging Zam’s signature for the purpose of\n                    recovering a relatively miniscule debt. 17     That said, the above factual findings are\n                    ultimately immaterial because, in my view, this case turns on the following\n                    issues: (a)     Do the 2nd ACLC and the other loan\n                        documents (collectively, the “Loan Documents”) confer on the\n                        Defendant an interest in the Property that is capable of supporting the\n                        Caveat? (b)     Assuming that the Defendant has an interest in the Property, should the\n                        Caveat nonetheless be removed for failure to comply with the formal\n                        requirements of s 115 of the LTA?",
        "Do the Loan Documents confer on the Defendant an interest in the\n                Property?": "Whether the Plaintiff’s consent to the 2nd ACLC was\n                required 18     It is common ground that the Caveat was lodged\n                    in respect of the 2nd Loan and not the 1st Loan (which the Defendant says was\n                    repaid promptly). Consequently, does it matter that the Plaintiff did not sign\n                    the 2nd ACLC? 19     As a preliminary point, I have no hesitation\n                    in rejecting the Defendant’s submission that the two loans should be\n                    considered as part of the same transaction. The two loans were obtained on\n                    separate occasions and a separate set of documentation was prepared for each.\n                    Furthermore, the claim in the Caveat (reproduced at [9] above) distinguishes\n                    between the two loans by referring to a loan application dated 21 October 2009\n                        (ie, the 2nd Loan). Therefore, the two loans\n                    did not form part of the same transaction, and the Plaintiff’s consent to\n                    the 1st ACLC in respect of the 1st Loan could not bind her in respect of the 2nd\n                    Loan. 20     I turn then to the legal issue of whether the\n                    Plaintiff’s consent was required for the 2nd ACLC. The Defendant says that\n                    Zam’s consent alone was sufficient to bind the Property under the concept\n                    of joint tenancy. The sole authority provided by the Defendant for this\n                    proposition isKua Hui Li v Prosper Credit Pte Ltd[2014] 3 SLR 1007 (“Kua Hui Li”).\n                    That case also involved an application by a plaintiff to remove a caveat lodged\n                    on her property by a moneylender. The caveat was lodged pursuant to a loan\n                    agreement between the plaintiff’s former husband and the moneylender under\n                    which the husband agreed to repay the loan from the sale proceeds of the\n                    property and consented to the lodgement of a caveat by the moneylender against\n                    the property. The plaintiff did not consent to this arrangement. Choo J noted\n                    that the following questions arose (at [8]): (a)    First, was the contract signed between OBL and the\n                            defendant valid? (b)    Second, had OBL and the defendant entered into any\n                            further contract (presumably pursuant to the $3,000 loan)? And if so,\n                            were those further contracts valid? (c)    Third, if there were any valid contracts, did any\n                            of those contracts serve to create an interest in the Property in favour\n                            of the defendant, notwithstanding that the plaintiff, as a co-owner, was\n                            not informed, and neither was her consent procured? (d)    Fourth, if the defendant did indeed have an\n                            interest in the Property when it lodged the caveat, are there any\n                            reasons that justify the removal of the caveat? 21     However, Choo J ultimately did not answer the\n                    third and fourth questions because he found that the interest rate charged by\n                    the moneylender in that case (namely, 791.61% per annum) was excessive and set\n                    aside the loan agreement under s 23(3)(b) of the\n                    MLA (at [14]). I therefore fail to see howKua Hui\n                        Liassists the Defendant in any way. In fact, it is trite that\n                    joint tenants have to act jointly to effectively bind the estate which they hold\n                    jointly: Tan Sook Yee, Tang Hang Wu and Kelvin F K Low,Tan\n                        Sook Yee’s Principles of Singapore Land Law(LexisNexis,\n                    3rd Ed, 2009) (“Tan Sook Yee”) at\n                    para 9.9. 22     But that is not the end of the issue. Might it\n                    be argued that a joint tenant’s assignment of his legal or equitable\n                    interest in thesale proceedsof a property is an\n                    act operating upon his own share that severs the joint tenancy and converts it\n                    into a tenancy in common? In the leading case ofWilliams v\n                        Hensman(1861) 1 John & H 546 at 557, Page Wood VC set out\n                    the following three methods of severance: A joint tenancy may be severed in three ways: in the first place, an act\n                        of any one of the persons interested operating upon his own share may create\n                        a severance as to that share ... Secondly, a joint-tenancy may be severed by\n                        mutual agreement. And, in the third place, there may be a severance by any\n                        course of dealing sufficient to intimate that the interests of all were\n                        mutually treated as constituting a tenancy in common. 23     This is a vexed area of law. For example, the\n                    English and Australian authorities appear to be divided over whether a charge\n                    granted by one joint tenant to a third party is an alienation that effectively\n                    severs a joint tenancy:Tan Sook Yeeat para 9.40.\n                    In his article “Partial Alienation by One Co-Owner of Land” [2000]\n                    SJLS 92, Professor Barry Crown surveyed the difficulties in this area and\n                    concluded as follows (at 108–109): The difficulties that have occurred in working out the\n                        effects of a partial alienation have their root in the doctrine that each\n                        joint tenant owns the whole of the estate and not merely a proportionate\n                        share. The problem is compounded when this is coupled with the idea that it\n                        is possible for one joint tenant to alienate an interest that he does not\n                        actually have and that he thereby creates the very interest which was\n                        supposedly the subject matter of the transfer in the first place. These\n                        notions are too firmly rooted in English law to be set aside now. However,\n                        as Lord Nicholls stated in the recent House of Lords case ofBurton v London Borough of Camden[[2000] 2 AC 399\n                        at 404–405], The legal concept relied upon ... is that a joint tenant, as distinct\n                            from a tenant in common, has nothing to transfer to the other tenant,\n                            because each already owns the whole. I have to say that this esoteric\n                            concept is remote from the realities of life. It should be handled with\n                            care, and applied with caution. An attempt has been made in this article to follow this guidance and to\n                        look at the law of severance in the light of the realities of life. The most\n                        important factor is the existence in Singapore of a simple and effective\n                        method of severance by statute. This, coupled with the need to ensure that\n                        parties are fully aware of their rights and that no one party should be able\n                        to sever behind the back of his fellow co-owners, means that the courts\n                        should not be astute to discover new methods of severance and, in\n                        particular, should avoid legitimising any form of severance which can be\n                        effected by one party without the knowledge of the other joint\n                        tenants. 24     However, I need not decide this issue because\n                    I find that,as a matter of interpretation, the\n                    Loan Documents did not confer on the Defendant any legal or equitable interest\n                    in the sale proceeds of the Property. I will elaborate on this later in the next\n                    section. Whether the Defendant has an interest in the proceeds of sale of\n                land (1)   The meaning of “interest in the proceeds of sale of\n                land” 25     Section 115 of the LTA allows any person\n                    “claiming an interest in land” to lodge with the Registrar a\n                    caveat prohibiting the registration of any dealing affecting the land. Two other\n                    sections in the LTA are pertinent for the purposes of construing the phrase\n                    “claiming an interest in land”. The first is s 4, which defines\n                    “interest” as follows: … “interest”, in relation to land, means any interest in land\n                        recognised as such by law, and includes an estate in land; … The second is s 115(3), which provides as follows: (3) For the purposes of this Part, and without limiting its\n                        generality, a reference to a person claiming an interest in land shall\n                        include a reference to any of the following persons: (a)any person who\n                                has an interest in the proceeds of sale of land, not\n                            being an interest arising from a judgment or order for the payment of\n                            money; and (b) a person who has obtained an\n                            injunction in respect of an estate or interest in land. [emphasis added] 26     The Defendant contends that the effect of the\n                    Loan Documents was that they granted it an interest in the sale proceeds of the\n                    Property. Pursuant to s 115(3)(a), this counts as\n                    an “interest in land” for the purpose of lodging a caveat. In\n                    reply, the Plaintiff submits that the Loan Documents merely granted Zam’s\n                    authorisation and consent for the Defendant to lodge a caveat, which is\n                    insufficient to create an interest in land. 27     There are thus two issues that I have to\n                    decide: (a)     What does “interest in the\n                        proceeds of the sale of land” in s 115(3)(a) mean? (b)     Do the Loan Documents create such an\n                    interest? 28     The progenitor of s 115(3)(a) of the LTA is s 93(1)(3) of the Land Titles Ordinance 1956\n                    (“the LTO”). That sub-section stated: 93.— … (3) For the Purposes of this Part, and without limiting its generality, an\n                        interest in the proceeds of sale of land shall be deemed an interest in\n                        land. 29     Significantly, no such provision can be found\n                    in the Real Property Act 1900 (NSW) (“the NSW RPA”), on which the\n                    LTO was modelled (the drafter of the LTO, John Baalman\n                    (“Baalman”), was an expert in the Torrens system of land titles\n                    registration in New South Wales:ACS Computer Pte Ltd v\n                        Rubina Watch Co (Pte) Ltd and another[1997] 1 SLR(R) 1006 at\n                    [18]). Section 74B(1) of the NSW RPA simply states: “A person who claims\n                    a legal or equitable estate or interest in land that is the subject of a primary\n                    application, or in any part of any such land, may … lodge with the\n                    Registrar-General a caveat prohibiting the bringing of that land or part under\n                    the provisions of this Act”. The same can be said of similar provisions\n                    in other Australian jurisdictions, such as s 89(1) of the Transfer of Land Act\n                    1958 (Vic). Consequently, the Australian courts have held that an interest in\n                    the sale proceeds of land is insufficient to found a caveat. InDykstra and another v Dysktra(1991) 22 NSWLR 556, the\n                    Supreme Court of New South Wales noted that a contractual right to payment of a\n                    sum of money out of the proceeds of sale of a particular property does not give\n                    rise to a caveatable interest (at 559). InEpple v\n                        Wilson[1972] VR 440, the Supreme Court of Victoria held that anequitableright to the sale proceeds does not\n                    do so either (at 444). 30     It is therefore necessary to consider why\n                    Baalman included s 93(3) in the LTO. Some light is shed by his authoritative\n                    commentary on the LTO. He wrote inThe Singapore Torrens\n                        System(The Government of the State of Singapore, 1961) at pp\n                    195–196: The number of interests which will justify the lodging of a\n                        caveat is limited by the number of permissible “interests in\n                        land”. InKeppelv.Bailey(1834) 2 My. & K. 517, 535; 39 E.R. 1042,Lord Brougham, L.C. said,— “It must not be supposed that incidents of a novel kind can be\n                            devised and attached to property at the fancy or caprice of any owner.\n                            It is clearly inconvenient both to the science of the law and the public\n                            weal that such latitude should be given. There can be no harm in\n                            allowing the fullest latitude to men in binding themselves … to\n                            answer in damages for breach of their obligations … But great\n                            detriment would arise and much confusion of rights if parties were\n                            allowed to invent new modes of holding and enjoying real\n                            property.” A new interest in land can be created only by legislation – either\n                        parliamentary, as in the case of perpetual leases, or judicial, as in the\n                        case of restrictive covenants … There is nothing in the [LTO] to\n                        suggest that this is one of the occasions on which the Legislature intended\n                        to create a new interest in land to be known as a caveatable\n                        interest. … A person entitled to land which has undergone the\n                            transformation effected by the equitable doctrine of conversion, would\n                            prima facie cease to have a caveatable interest. Section 93 (3) operates\n                            to reconvert an interest in the proceeds of sale of land (e.g. under a\n                            trust for sale) into an interest in land. [emphasis added in italics] 31     The equitable doctrine of conversion that\n                    Baalman referred to requires some elaboration. One of the common law methods for\n                    settling land was the device of a trust for sale. This arose where land was\n                    transferred by deed or will to trustees with an imperative direction that they\n                    were to effect a sale and to hold the proceeds of sale upon certain specified\n                    trusts. The equitable doctrine of conversion states that in such cases, the\n                    interests of the beneficiaries were in the proceeds of sale and not in the land,\n                    because equity looks on that as done which ought to be done – the\n                    imperative direction to turn land into money impresses the land with the quality\n                    of money no matter how long the sale may be postponed. The effect of this\n                    doctrine was that when the trustees sold the land in performance of their duty\n                    to sell, the purchaser took the land free of any trusts, since the beneficial\n                    interests were imposed upon the sale proceeds and not the land itself: see\n                    Edward H Burn and John Cartwright,Cheshire and Burn’s\n                        Modern Law of Real Property(Oxford University Press, 18th Ed,\n                    2011) at pp 104–105. 32     The equitable doctrine of conversion gives\n                    rise to problems in cases where the operation of another legal mechanism is\n                    contingent on the beneficiary of a trust for sale having an interest in land.\n                    One example can be found in the case ofIrani Finance Ltd v\n                        Singh and others[1971] 1 Ch 59. Under s 35 of the Administration\n                    of Justice Act 1956 (c 46) (UK), a judgment creditor could obtain a court order\n                    imposing a charge on “any such land or interest in land of the\n                    debtor” to secure the payment of the judgment debt. The issue was whether\n                    the first and second defendants, who were legal and equitable tenants of land\n                    conveyed to them under a trust for sale, had “land or interest in\n                    land” capable of being charged under s 35. The Court of Appeal held that\n                    they did not, reasoning as follows (at 79–80): … The words \"interest in land\" are no doubt capable in an\n                        appropriate context of including interests under trusts for sale of land,\n                        and though there is no need for us to express a concluded opinion on the\n                        point we certainly do not wish to be taken to be casting any doubt on the\n                        correctness of the dicta inCooperv.Critchley[1955] Ch. 431, but for 100\n                        years before 1956 the words, or equivalent words, have been held in this\n                        field not to include interests arising under trusts for sale. If it had been\n                        the intention of Parliament in 1956 to subject interests or some interests\n                        arising under trusts for sale of land to charges for judgment debts, it\n                        would surely have done so in clear terms. … … The whole purpose of the trust for sale is to make sure, by\n                        shifting the equitable interests away from the land and into the proceeds of\n                        sale, that a purchaser of the land takes free from the equitable interests.\n                        To hold these to be equitable interests in the land itself would be to\n                        frustrate this purpose. Even to hold that they have equitable interests in\n                        the land for a limited period, namely, until the land is sold, would, we\n                        think, be inconsistent with the trust for sale being an \"immediate\" trust\n                        for sale working an immediate conversion, which is what the Law of Property\n                        Act, 1925, envisages (see section 205 (1) (xxix)), though, of course, it is\n                        not in fact only such a limited interest that the plaintiffs are seeking to\n                        charge. 33     It therefore appears that the purpose of s\n                        115(3)(a) of the LTA is to avoid difficulties\n                    like these and allow a beneficiary of a trust for sale to protect his or her\n                    interest by means of a caveat. This is not to say, however, that\n                        s 115(3)(a) is restricted only to\n                    individuals whose interests arise under a trust for sale. The provision is\n                    phrased in general terms, and Baalman himself made it clear that the trust for\n                    sale is just one example under which a person might acquire an interest in the\n                    sale proceeds of land. Another example might be the interest of a foreign person\n                    who inherits a property under the will of the deceased owner or through the law\n                    on intestate succession:Tan Sook Yeeat para\n                    15.11. Under s 3(3) of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274, 2009 Rev Ed), no\n                    estate or interest in the property would pass to the foreign person; however, s\n                    3(4) imposes a duty on the personal representatives of the deceased to sell the\n                    property within five years and pay the net sale proceeds to the foreign person.\n                    A foreign person in such a situation might therefore be said to have an interest\n                    in the proceeds of sale of land. 34     In both of the above cases, the caveator has a\n                    definite entitlement to the proceeds of sale because the trustee or the personal\n                    representative is charged with adutyof sale.\n                    There is no doubt that the property has to be sold, and the only issue to be\n                    decided is that of timing. It therefore makes sense to allow such persons to\n                    lodge caveats to protect their interest in the sale proceeds. But where there isnoduty of sale and the caveator’s\n                    interest in the sale proceeds is wholly contingent on the owner of the property\n                    deciding to sell, would that suffice as a caveatable interest? 35     If the matter were free of authority, I would\n                    have thought that such an interest would be insufficient to support a caveat.\n                    Such a nebulous interest appears too far removed from the type of the interest\n                    that s 115(3)(a) of the LTA was originally meant\n                    to protect. But at least two cases have held that a right to be paid out of the\n                    sale proceeds of land is a caveatable interest, even where there is no duty of\n                    sale. First, inAbdul Hamid Bin Mohamed Ismail and Others v\n                        Shaik Raheem s/o Abdul Shaik Shaik Dawood and Another Action[2005] SGDC 28 (“Abdul Hamid”), the\n                    plaintiffs obtained a $20,000 loan from a licensed moneylender. The relevant\n                    terms of the loan agreement were as follows (at [7]): Covenant to give notice 3.    The Borrowers covenant with the Company that at all\n                            times before full payment of the loan and interest not to sell or\n                            transfer or otherwise dispose of their interest in the flat at Block 138\n                            Bukit Batok West Avenue 6 #02-389 Singapore 650138 (hereinafter referred\n                            to as “the Flat”) without giving prior notice of at least\n                            seven (7) days of the date of such sale transfer or otherwise to the\n                            Company. Assignment of sale proceeds 4.    The Borrowers agree that the sale proceeds of the\n                            sale of the Flat that the Borrowers may become entitled or receive from\n                            the purchaser of the Flat have been assigned to the Company for the\n                            repayment of all monies due to the Company under the Terms and\n                            conditions of this Agreement. Consent to Caveat 5.    The Borrowers hereby consent to the Company lodging\n                            a Caveat with the Singapore Land Registry against the title of the Flat\n                            and confirm that the Company has an interest in the sale proceeds of the\n                            sale of the Flat PROVIDED THAT the Company shall on receipt of all\n                            monies due and owing to the Company by the Borrowers withdraw the\n                            Caveat. Further Assurance 6.    The Borrowers shall at all times if and required by\n                            the Company execute such further charges or assignments or other\n                            documents as may be necessary to effect the assignment of the sale\n                            proceeds of the Flat to the Company or the due payment of the Loan to\n                            the Company. 36     The district judge held that the moneylender\n                    was entitled to lodge a caveat on the plaintiffs’ property. Her reasoning\n                    merits setting out in full (at [19]–[21]): 19    On principles of statutory interpretation, I could\n                            not agree with the plaintiffs’ submissions. The wording of section\n                            115(3)(a) read in their plain and literal sense clearly intended to\n                            widen the scope of “interest in land” for purposes of\n                            caveats to include a person who has an interest in the proceeds of sale\n                            of the land which may not necessarily arise from recognized categories\n                            of interests in land. It should be noted that the interpretations in\n                            section 4 are prefaced with the words “unless\n                                the context otherwise requires”. The opening words\n                            of section 115(3)(a) – “For the purposes\n                                of this Part”- in themselves already set a\n                            different context altogether to require a different meaning to be\n                            accorded to the word “interest”. This preamble to section\n                            115(3)(a) must surely signify a legislative intent to import a wider\n                            interpretation to the definition of “interest in land” in\n                            the part of the Act dealing with caveats than those appearing in the\n                            other parts of the Act. If the plaintiffs’ contentionsvizthat these words should be restricted to the\n                            definition of “interest” as in section 4, reflect the true\n                            intent of Parliament, section 115(3)(a) would, in my view, be rendered\n                            otiose. 20    If the interpretation of section 115(3)(a) has to\n                            be circumscribed in the manner advocated by the plaintiffs, it would not\n                            have been necessary for Parliament to introduce the amendment in 2001 to\n                            delimit the categories of interests to those “not being an interest arising from a judgment or order for the\n                                payment of money”. It must have been contemplated\n                            that the category of caveatable interests in section 115(3)(a) would\n                            include interests other than proprietary interests or what we\n                            traditionally understand as interests in land. If a caveator’s\n                            interest in the sale proceeds of land came about only by way of an\n                            attempt to enforce a monetary judgment with no other connection\n                            whatsoever to the property, such an interest would be outlawed by the\n                            delimiting words in section 115(3)(a). It would appear from these words\n                            that you cannot seek to encumber the titles of registered land by\n                            lodging caveats when all that you have against the registered proprietor\n                            is a judgment or order for payment of money. The judgment creditor can\n                            however seek enforcement of his judgment against the property of the\n                            judgment debtor by applying for a writ of seizure and sale pursuant to\n                            Order 47 Rule 4 of the Rules of Court and the order made thereon would\n                            then be registered with the Land Titles Registry. A judgment creditor\n                            would therefore have no necessity to lodge a caveat as he already has\n                            the means to attach the property of the debtor and to have his interest\n                            to the property notified on the register. 21    Considering the way section 115(3)(a) has been\n                            drafted, it leads to the irresistible conclusion that there would be\n                            categories of interests in proceeds of sale of land which would not come\n                            within the general understanding of an interest in land. It has been\n                            recognized by textbook writers that the rights covered by section\n                            115(3)(a) are not really interests in land. 37     Second, inHo Seek Yueng\n                        Novel and another v J & V Development Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR(R)\n                    742 (“Novel Ho”), the owner of the\n                    defendant company (“Mr Tan”) had caused caveats to be lodged\n                    against 12 properties. He offered two bases to support the caveats. First, by\n                    way of an oral agreement, he had granted the plaintiffs a loan in respect of the\n                    sale and purchase of the properties. Second, under the same oral agreement, the\n                    plaintiffs had granted him a right of first refusal in respect of the sale and\n                    purchase of the properties. In the event that he agreed to purchase the property\n                    concerned, the loan granted to the plaintiffs in respect of the said property\n                    would be set off against the sale price; if he did not wish to purchase the\n                    property and it was sold to a third party, the loan concerned would then be\n                    repaid by the plaintiffs from the sale proceeds. 38     The High Court accepted Mr Tan’s version\n                    of events and held that both the loan agreement and the right of first refusal\n                    independently conferred on Mr Tan a caveatable interest in the properties.\n                    Unfortunately, although the court devoted a large amount of space to explaining\n                    why the right of first refusal gave rise to a caveatable interest, there was\n                    relatively little analysis of why theloancreated\n                    such an interest as well. The court simply stated as follows (at\n                    [38]–[39]): 38    As already alluded to above, the first legal issue\n                            is whether or not the loan extended by the defendant to the plaintiffs\n                            gave rise to an interest in land that was caveatable under the\n                            LTA. 39    The defendant's interest in this regard would be in\n                            the sale proceeds and this is clearly an interest in land that is\n                            caveatable under the LTA. This is in factexpressly\n                                provided forunder s 115(3)(a) of the LTA, which was also referred to by counsel for\n                            the defendant in his closing submissions. … [emphasis in original] 39     InAbdul Hamid,\n                    there was an express assignment of the future sale proceeds to the caveator. InNovel Ho, however, there was no mention of any\n                    assignment and Mr Tan’s right to the sale proceeds appears to be purely\n                    contractual in nature. The proposition that apersonalright to the repayment of a debt can create a\n                    caveatable interest within the meaning of s 115(3)(a) sits uneasily with the original object and purpose of that\n                    section (which I have set out earlier). This was pointed out in William J M\n                    Ricquier,Land Law(LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2007) at p\n                    127, where the learned author made the following observation on the decision inNovel Ho: It is the first holding, regarding the loan, that perhaps raises more\n                        questions. Much depends on what is mean[t] by ‘an interest in the\n                        proceeds of sale’ in s 115(3)(a). On the face of it, it means a\n                        proprietary interest. A beneficiary under a trust for sale has an interest\n                        in the proceeds of sale because of the equitable doctrine of conversion. A\n                        foreign person who inherits residential property – which has to be\n                        sold pursuant to the provisions of the Residential Property Act – has\n                        an interest in the proceeds of sale thereof. Mr Tan’s\n                        ‘interest’ in the proceeds of sale of the Geylang properties\n                        looks more like a personal, contractual claim. 40     Admittedly, there is a trend in our courts\n                    towards allowing non-proprietary interests to be caveated. One example is a\n                    right of first refusal (also known as a right of pre-emption). The prevailing\n                    judicial opinion is that such a right is purely contractual in nature at the\n                    time of its grant: see the survey of this area of law inNovel Hoat [51]–[56]; see alsoOng\n                        Chay Tong & Sons (Pte) Ltd v Ong Hoo Eng[2009] 1 SLR(R) 305\n                        (“Ong Chay Tong”) at [79] and\n                    [83]. However, the High Court inNovel Hoand the\n                    Court of Appeal inOng Chay Tonghave held that a\n                    right of first refusal is an interest in land that can sustain a caveat. A key\n                    rationale for this holding is that land is unique, so that certain interests in\n                    land, although not proprietary in nature, are also deserving of protection by\n                    the caveat machinery. As pointed out inNovel Ho(at [62]): … It must also be emphasised at this juncture that the subject\n                        matter involved island or real propertyand,\n                        given the uniqueness of land, the holder of a right of first refusal might\n                        well consider a contractual remedy in damages to be inadequate –\n                        hence, the possible remedy of an injunction or even specific performance\n                        … [emphasis in original] The reasoning was approved by the court inOng\n                        Chay Tong(at [79]): … In particular, we agree with Phang J that such an approach would\n                        be consistent with the purpose and function of a caveat, and thatit would be fair, logical and commonsensical to allow a person\n                            with a pre-emption right overa defined\n                            piece of unique propertyto lodge a caveat\n                            over that property. This would avoid a situation where a\n                        pre-emption right is defeated by the stealth assignment of the legal\n                        interest or by way of s 49 of the LTA without the holder of the right\n                        having first the opportunity to invoke the court process to give effect to\n                        his right. While such a conclusion might at first blush be interpreted by\n                        some as giving undue \"proprietary\" reach to a \"personal\" right, we should\n                        nevertheless be mindful of the fact that a contractual restraint on land has\n                        long been recognised as one that is susceptible to injunctive relief ...\n                        [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 41     But where a person is claiming an interest in\n                    thesale proceedsof land, his interest is purely\n                    monetary in nature and I can see no reason why, bearing in mind the original\n                    object and purpose of s 115(3)(a), the requirement of a proprietary interest\n                    should not apply strictly in such a case. To hold that a person with a mere\n                    contractual right to be paid from the sale proceeds of a property can lodge a\n                    caveat on that property would effectively allow such agreements to function as a\n                    form of quasi-security, since the caveatee would be unable to register dealings\n                    in respect of the property until he pays up. This is not a purpose of the caveat\n                    mechanism; a caveat is meant to protect pre-existing interests in land, not\n                    operate in and of itself as a form of quasi-security for otherwise unsecured\n                    debts. If a moneylender wishes to take security over a borrower’s\n                    property, he should take a mortgage or a charge. Moreover, it would create an\n                    anomaly whereby a creditor who has a contractual right to have a loan repaid out\n                    of the sale proceeds of property may lodge a caveat on the basis of his\n                    contractual claim, but a creditor who successfully sues the debtor on the same\n                    contract (so that his claim is extinguished by the judgment and merged into the\n                    latter) may not. 42     This is another area of law raising difficult\n                    issues that might merit re-examination in the future. Once again, however, I\n                    need not decide them definitively because I find that the Loan Documents did not\n                    confer any legal, equitable or even contractual interest in the sale proceeds.\n                    Even if they did, any interest acquired by the Defendant has already been\n                    extinguished by the Syariah Court Order. (2)   The effect of the Loan Documents 43     I turn now to the issue of how the Loan\n                    Documents should be interpreted. I have already set out all the relevant terms\n                    at [6]–[7] above; there are no other terms or notes in the loan documents\n                    which say anything about a caveat or the sale proceeds of the Property. I should\n                    also mention that in the note of contract for the 2nd Loan, section I(g) titled\n                    “Details of security (if any)” was left blank. 44     Before I go on to examine the relevant terms,\n                    it is necessary to consider several instructive cases. First, inTroncone and others v Aliperti and others(1994) 6 BPR\n                    13,291 (“Troncone”), the Court of\n                    Appeal of New South Wales had to consider the effect of a clause\n                    (“CL5”) in a loan agreement stating: “The Debtor authorises\n                    the Creditors to lodge a Caveat on any property owned by the Debtors (sic) to\n                    protect his interest.” There was no other clause in the agreement\n                    providing for any security for the repayment of the loan. Nonetheless, the court\n                    held that CL5 was effective in creating a caveatable interest. Mahoney JA\n                    reasoned as follows (at 13,292): It was, in my opinion, the clear intention of the parties that the\n                        creditors should have from Mr Aliperti the authority \"to lodge a caveat on\n                        any property owned by\" him. In my opinion, CL5, on its proper construction\n                        authorised the person or persons described in the relevant agreement as \"the\n                        Creditors\" to lodge a caveat to protect the interest of that creditor or\n                        creditors. … It is a fundamental principle of construction that\n                            \"Whoever grants a thing is deemed also to grant that without which the\n                            grant itself would be of no effect\"(\"Cuicunque aliquis quid\n                        concedit concedere videtur et id sine quo res ipsa esse non potuit\"):\n                        Broome's Legal Maxims (9th ed) at 307. The principle is said to go back at\n                        least to Shepherds Touchstone 89. A caveat cannot be entered against land unless the caveator has the\n                        relevant proprietary interest in the land: see Real Property Act 1900,\n                        s74F(1) (\"a legal or equitable estate or interest in land\").Therefore, unless there be evident an intention to the\n                            contrary, the grant to the creditors of an authority to lodge a caveat\n                            on the relevant property carried with it by implication such an estate\n                            or interest in land as was necessary to enable that authority to be\n                            exercised.There was, in the present case, no intention to\n                        the contrary. Indeed, it might be thought to involve deception or worse if\n                        Mr Aliperti had intended to authorise the lodgment of a caveat but to\n                        withhold the creation of the interest in the land necessary for that to be\n                        done. [emphasis added] 45     However, inThe Asiatic\n                        Enterprises (Pte) Ltd v United Overseas Bank Ltd[1999] 3 SLR(R)\n                    976 (“Asiatic”), the Court of Appeal\n                    held that Singapore’s LTA was different and declined to followTronconeand other Australian authorities in the same\n                    vein. InAsiatic, the Court of Appeal had to\n                    consider the effect of the following clause (at [3]): On the occurrence of any of the following events of default (i) the Bank\n                        [the respondent] shall cease to be under any further commitment to you [the\n                        appellant] and all outstandings under the entire credit line ('the\n                        Outstandings') shall become due and payable immediately; (ii) the Bank\n                        shall, in addition to the rights set out herein, be entitled (as equitable\n                        chargee) to attach the Outstandings to any property of yours (whether real\n                        or personal) and to lodge a caveat against any real property that may now or\n                        hereafter be registered in your name whether singly or jointly ... The court held that this clause did not create a charge or any\n                    interest in land that was capable of supporting a caveat, for the following\n                    reasons (at [28]–[29]): 28    In our opinion, a\n                            caveat is premised on a certain estate or interest in land which the\n                            caveator claims. The respondent could not claim an interest in the\n                            appellant's registered land as an equitable chargee, if at all, until\n                            the occurrence of an event of default, and in that event it exercised\n                            its right under cl 10 of the Standard Terms to take a charge over such\n                            property. On the approach contended by counsel, such an interest would\n                            arise at the point in time when the respondent lodged the caveats\n                            against the properties on 9 July 1998, as that act constituted the\n                            exercise of its option. However, the statutory framework relating to the\n                            lodgement of caveats presupposes that the respondent already had a\n                            pre-existing claim to an equitable charge over the properties which\n                            supported the caveats it lodged on that day. This \"paradox\" was\n                            demonstrated clearly by Ashley J inChiodoat 11 as follows: The conclusion reached by Handley JA that 'the action of the lender in\n                            lodging the caveat operated as an exercise of its option to attach its\n                            debt to the subject property, and create an equitable charge over that\n                            property', has been described (see 68 ALJ at 752) as involving a\n                            paradox. It is this:assuming that an equitable\n                                charge over land, without more, is a sufficient estate or interest\n                                in land to sustain a caveat lodged under s 89(1) of the [Transfer of\n                                Land Act 1958], the language of the subsection assumes the existence\n                                of the interest antecedent to lodgment. But here,\n                            according to the reasoning of Handley JA, the lodging of the caveat was\n                            a necessary step in the creation of the equitable interest that the\n                            lodgment in turn was intended to protect. There was not, antecedent to\n                            lodgment, an estate or interest in land capable of attracting the\n                            operation of s 89(1). Such an estate or interest ... arose\n                            contemporaneously with lodgment. 29On the basis of the statutory\n                                framework, it is impossible, in terms of chronology, for the\n                                lodgement of a caveat to be the act which also gives rise to the\n                                claim to an interest in land needed to support the same\n                                caveat.In our judgment, the act of lodging a caveat by a\n                            caveator does not have the effect of creating that interest in land for\n                            which the caveat was lodged. The Act does not contemplate such an act as\n                            creating an interest in land. [emphasis added] Although the decision inAsiatichas\n                    been the subject of some academic criticism (see,eg, Barry Crown, “Requirement of a Pre-Existing Interest\n                    to Support a Caveat under the Land Titles Act” [2000] SJLS 341; Lee Eng\n                    Beng, “Invisible and Springing Security Interests in Corporate Insolvency\n                    Law” (2000) 12 SAcLJ 210; Victor C S Yeo, “No Security for the\n                    Unsecured Creditor” (2000) 12 SAcLJ 218), it remains the law in Singapore\n                    and I am bound by it. 46     I should add that the force ofTronconeappears to have been attenuated even in\n                    Australia. InBellissimo v JCL Investments Pty Ltd[2009] NSWSC 1260, the Supreme Court of New South Wales had to consider the\n                    effect of the following clause (at [11]): That the company J C L INVESTMENTS PTY LTD hereby consents to Francesco\n                        Bellissimo t/as Bellissimo & Associates Solicitors to lodge a caveat at\n                        the Property Information Service division of the Department of Lands, over\n                        the property known as folio identifier lot X section Y in deposited plan Z\n                        situated at AA Ellis Street Condell Park 2200 in the State of New South\n                        Wales whereby it is hereby agreed that Frank Bellissimo has a caveatable\n                        interest in the property and that Francesco Bellissimo will withdraw the\n                        caveat only upon payment of costs and disbursements referred to in (i) and\n                        (ii) immediately above and any interest payable in accordance with the fees\n                        agreements annexed to this Deed. Despite citingTronconeand\n                    acknowledging the principle that “whoever grants a thing is deemed to\n                    grant that without which the grant itself would be of no effect” (at\n                    [12]), White J held that the clause didnotgive\n                    rise to a caveatable interest. He reasoned as follows (at [17], [18] and\n                    [21]): 17    Had it been intended to create a charge, whereby\n                            the plaintiff could apply to the court for an order for sale of the\n                            property or for the appointment of a receiver, one would expect the\n                            nature of that arrangement to be spelled out clearly in an agreement\n                            between a solicitor and his client, or between a solicitor and a company\n                            associated with the client, and not be left to\n                        implication. 18    It is more likely that the parties intended by\n                            clause 2(iii), that by the plaintiff's being authorised to lodge a\n                            caveat, and by its being agreed that he had a caveatable interest in the\n                            property, that the parties intended, and intended only, that the company\n                            would not be permitted to deal with the land without the plaintiff's\n                            consent. Such a negative covenant does not create an interest in land\n                                (Redglove Projects Pty Ltd v Ngunnawal Local\n                                Aboriginal Land Council). … 22    I should add that there is a public policy interest\n                            in persons taking instruments which are intended to create a mortgage or\n                            charge in drawing to the attention of the mortgagor or chargor, being\n                            the party primarily liable for the duty, that, such a liability exists.\n                            At the very least that would draw to the attention of those signing such\n                            instruments that an agreement, which in terms is expressed to be an\n                            agreement to the lodgment of a caveat, will be contended by the other\n                            party to amount to a charge over the first person's land. 47     Applying the above principles, I find that\n                    neither para 6 of the Notes to the Contract nor the 2nd ACLC granted the\n                    Defendant any legal or equitable interest in the Property or in the sale\n                    proceeds thereof. In fact, the Defendant did not even acquire acontractualright to have the 2nd Loan repaid from the\n                    sale proceeds of the Property. This is because: (a)     Paragraph 6 simply states that a\n                        caveat will be lodged on the Property if payment is not prompt and removed\n                        upon completion of the loan payment. It does not say that the interest in\n                        the sale proceeds of the Property are assigned to the Defendant or to be\n                        held on trust for it. Nor is there mention of any agreement to repay the 2nd\n                        Loan out of the sale proceeds. (b)     The 2nd ACLC states that Zam authorises and consents to\n                        the lodgement of a caveat by the Defendant to secure its interest in the\n                        sale proceeds of the Property. But this presupposes that the Defendant has\n                        an interest in the sale proceeds in the first place. Since there is nothing\n                        else in the loan documents which confers on the Defendant such an interest,\n                        there is nothing for a caveat to secure. As held inAsiaticat [29], the act of lodging a caveat cannot in\n                        itself create the interest that is supposed to support the\n                    caveat. 48     Therefore, the Defendant does not have a\n                    caveatable interest in the Property, and the Caveat ought to be\n                removed. (3)   The Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds has been\n                extinguished 49     Even if my analysis above is incorrect and the\n                    Loan Documents were effective in conferring on the Defendant a caveatable\n                    interest in the Property, there is, in my judgment, another reason why the\n                    Caveat ought to be removed: the Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds\n                    have been extinguished by the Syariah Court Order. 50     Assuming that the Loan Documents granted the\n                    Defendant an interest in the sale proceeds of the Property, they could only have\n                    given the Defendant an interest inZam’sshare of the sale proceeds, since the Plaintiff did not sign the Loan Documents.\n                    The Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds was therefore contingent on\n                    Zam being entitled to sell the Property and receive proceeds therefrom. But\n                    under the Syariah Court Order, Zam was ordered to transfer his interest in the\n                    Property to the Plaintiff for no consideration (see [10] above). Thus, a sale of\n                    the Property by Zam is no longer possible, and even if the Plaintiff decides to\n                    sell it, Zam would have no entitlement to the sale proceeds. The\n                    Defendant’s interest in the sale proceeds is correspondingly extinguished\n                    and there is no basis for allowing the Caveat to remain. 51     In this regard, one must keep in mind that a\n                    caveat is “nothing more than [a] statutory injunction to keep the\n                    property in status quo until the court has had an opportunity of discovering\n                    what are the rights of the parties”:Alrich\n                        Development Pte Ltd v Rafiq Jumabhoy[1993] 1 SLR(R) 598 at [37].\n                    In the present case, the Caveat has served its purpose. The Property has been\n                    kept in status quo while I considered what the rights of the parties were. As a\n                    result of this process I have found that the Defendant never had any caveatable\n                    interest in the Property or its sale proceeds, and that even if it did, this\n                    interest has since been extinguished by the Syariah Court Order. Consequently,\n                    the Caveat should be removed.",
        "Should the Caveat be removed for failure to comply with the formal\n                requirements of s 115(1) of the LTA?": "52     Given my findings at [47] above, it follows\n                    that the Caveat also does not satisfy the formal requirements of s 115(1) of the\n                    LTA because its description (see [9] above) is erroneous. There was no agreement\n                    between the Defendant and the registered proprietors of the Property that\n                    Zam’s debt would be paid from the sale proceeds of the Property, nor does\n                    the Defendant have any equitable interest in the sale proceeds.",
        "Section 51 of the HDA": "53     The final issue relates to s 51 of the HDA,\n                    which provides as follows: Property not to be used as\n                            security or attached, etc., and no trust in respect thereof to be\n                            created without approval of Board 51.—(1) Subject to subsection (4), any contract or agreement to\n                        directly or indirectly use protected property (or the proceeds of sale of\n                        protected property) as security or collateral for any debt, obligation or\n                        claim shall be null and void.

As the Minister for National\n                    Development stated in Parliament (Singapore Parliamentary\n                        Debates, Official Report(19 July 2010) vol 87 at cols 723,\n                    725–726, (Mah Bow Tan, Minister for National Development)): Members may recall that in 2008, Parliament approved the Moneylenders Bill\n                        to revamp the regulatory regime for moneylenders. The purpose was to\n                        introduce a more flexible and progressive approach to the regulation of\n                        moneylending to keep pace with the modern credit economy. Following\n                        this, the number of moneylenders licences has increased\n                        significantly. At the same time, there has been an increasing number of HDB flat owners\n                        borrowing from moneylenders and agreeing to assign the sales proceeds from\n                        their flats as repayment. These moneylenders then lodge caveats against\n                        the flats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds.   In 2008, there\n                        were 12 registered resale applications with caveats lodged by\n                        moneylenders.  In 2009, the figure increased to 546. In the six\n                        months of this year alone, there were 556 such cases. While this is permitted under the current legislative framework, the\n                        Government is concerned about this trend as it undermines the intention of\n                        the home ownership policy which seeks to provide a home for our people for\n                        long-term stay. … Sir, under the current rules, moneylenders can enter into an agreement\n                        with the HDB flat owners for the sales proceeds to be assigned to them as\n                        repayment of debt, upon which the moneylenders then lodge caveats against\n                        the flats. Such caveats enable the moneylender to determine repayment owed\n                        before he agrees to withdraw the caveat to allow the sale transaction of the\n                        flat to go through. The problem is that once the flat seller has sold off his flat and repaid\n                        the moneylender, he cannot afford to purchase his next flat. The flat seller\n                        and the other flat occupiers become homeless and pose a burden to their\n                        family and friends for their housing needs and some join HDB's queue for\n                        rental flats, when they in fact do not qualify for rental housing. Against this context, we have decided to go one step further now and\n                        disallow the lodging of caveats to claim an interest in the sales proceeds\n                        of the flat. And this is the focus of the Housing and Development\n                        (Amendment) Bill 2010 that is before this House now. Currently, section 51 of the Housing and Development Act only provides\n                        that the title deeds of HDB flats cannot be used to create a security for\n                        debt. Section 51 does not prevent moneylenders from lodging caveats to claim\n                        an interest in the sales proceeds, after providing a loan. Clause 5 of the Bill repeals the existing section 51 and re-enacts the\n                        section. It continues to disallow HDB flat owners from using their HDB flat\n                        as security or collateral for any debt, or obligation, or claim. One key\n                        difference with this new clause is that this prohibition now includes the\n                        sales proceeds from the HDB flat. The re-enacted section 51 also implements\n                        a new rule that voids any contract or agreement to use HDB flats, including\n                        the sales proceeds, as security or collateral. The changes do not affect\n                        banks and financial institutions, who can continue to grant loans on the\n                        security of the flat for the purpose of financing its purchase. Besides providing that any contract using the HDB flat as security for\n                        debt is null and void, the Bill also provides that any Act, deed, instrument\n                        or document which protects rights under such a contract has no effect. This\n                        means that caveats against HDB flats for the payment of debt can no longer\n                        be lodged after the Bill is enacted.Existing contracts\n                            with valid caveats lodged would not be affected. This is in recognition\n                            of the sanctity of contracts that are already legally entered\n                            into. [emphasis added] 55     Section 51 of the HDA thus appears to supply a\n                    complete answer to the present case, and the Plaintiff did indeed attempt to\n                    rely on it. The spanner in the works is that it only came into force on 11\n                    August 2010. It therefore does not affect the agreement for the 2nd Loan which\n                    was concluded on 21 October 2009. Nevertheless, as explained earlier, I have\n                    held that the Caveat should be removed for other reasons.",
        "Conclusion": "56     For the foregoing reasons, I allow the\n                    Plaintiff’s application and order that: (a)     the Caveat lodged by the Defendant\n                        against the Property be removed; (b)     the Registrar of the Supreme Court be empowered to\n                        execute any and all documents on the Defendant’s behalf to enable the\n                        Caveat to be removed; and (c)     the Defendant to be restrained from lodging further\n                        caveats against the Property in respect of the 2nd\n                Loan. 57     The Plaintiff is entitled to the costs of\n                    these proceedings to be taxed if not agreed."
