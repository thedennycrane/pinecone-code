        "(a)    Did Ang sign on the loan document?": "20.        The Loan Agreement bore\n\nAng’s signature. The Defendants admitted that the signature of Ang on the Loan\n\nAgreement was genuine but unauthorised. Ang said that he did not remember the occasion\n\nwhere he had signed on the loan document. It was contended that the Loan Agreement was\n\nprinted on one of the many blank pieces of A4 size paper that Ang had previously\n\npre-signed on instructions of Goh. As this contention was not put to Kwee in\n\ncross-examination, Counsel for the Plaintiff submitted that Kwee’s account of the\n\ncreation of the loan document was not contradicted by way of cross-examination and\n\ntherefore the court should accept what Kwee said: seeBrowne v Dunn(1893) 6 R 67;\n\nSeet Melvin v Law Society of Singapore[1995] 2 SLR 323at 338 andDr. Lo Sook\n\nLing Adela v Au Mei Yin Christina & Anor[2002] 1 SLR 408.21.        Kwee, Quek and Lim were\n\nhardly challenged on their respective evidence on the matter. Nevertheless, from reading\n\nthe pleadings, written statements, notes of evidence and closing submissions, it is clear\n\nthat Kwee was well aware of the issue. The rule would not apply in circumstances where\n\nnotice of the matter in issue was so distinctly and unmistakably given and it would be a\n\nwaste of time in putting questions to Kwee upon it: seeBrowne v Dunnat p71. In\n\nany event, I did not think that the failure to comply with the rule inBrowne v Dunnled to any prejudice.22.        Having looked at the loan\n\ndocument carefully, I find the Defendants’ contention completely untenable given the\n\npositioning of the signature on the execution page relative to the format and text of the\n\nentire document. There was no sign of manipulation of the text to accommodate the\n\nsignature.23.        In any case, Lim, the\n\nPlaintiff’s solicitor, testified that he prepared and later emailed in draft the Loan\n\nAgreement, Deed of Guarantee and Warranty and Undertaking to the Plaintiff who printed out\n\nthe draft documents. When the loan document was handed to him by the Plaintiff, it had\n\nonly the Plaintiff’s signature on it. Quek confirmed this. Having spotted the\n\nomission, Lim asked the Plaintiff to collect the Defendants’ signature. Kwee passed\n\nthe loan document to Quek and Goh to get it signed by the Defendants. It was later\n\nreturned to Lim with Ang’s signature on the loan document. In my judgment, I find\n\nthat Ang did sign on the loan document itself in his capacity as director of Biogenics.",
        "(b)    Is the loan unauthorised in absence of a\n\nresolution?": "24.        On the question of\n\nauthority, the Defendants argued that it was not bound by the Loan Agreement in the\n\nabsence of a resolution approving the loan and authority of Ang to bind the Defendants. It\n\nwas common ground that the power to borrow money was within the express powers of the\n\nDefendants under the memorandum of association.25.        The Defendants’\n\ncontention that, on the facts of this case, the rule in Turquand was displaced had little\n\nweight or substance. There was no evidence as to when the Plaintiff or his lawyers had\n\ncaused a registry of companies search to be carried out on Biogenics. After the Loan\n\nAgreement was signed but before the third tranche of the loan was disbursed, Lim had on 11\n\nOctober 2000 as a matter of housekeeping asked Law to send the various documentation\n\nrequired of Biogenics which included a resolution approving the loan. It may be inferred\n\nfrom Law’s reply that he had asked Kwee for the wording of the resolution which Kwee\n\nsent to Law on 24 October 2000. The Defendants did not provide the Plaintiff with a signed\n\nresolution as promised by Law. It would, in my view, be extremely unfair to allow the\n\nDefendants to use their own omission or failure against the Plaintiff. Besides, it cannot\n\nbe said that the transaction was one in which the Defendants did not stand to benefit even\n\nif the Plaintiff was in any of the ways allegedly put on inquiry.26.        The Defendants also\n\nsubmitted that the Plaintiff ought to have been put on inquiry by the very fact that Ang\n\nand Liow were nominee directors and shareholders. On a balance of probabilities, the\n\nconverse argument is the more likely. Biogenics was the deliberate creation of Goh for the\n\nrestructuring scheme. There was evidence as to the reason for the loan, which, in my\n\njudgment, was initiated and arranged by Goh, and the loan document was initialled by Goh\n\nto signify his consent to all the terms that he had negotiated and accepted in its final\n\nform on behalf of the Defendants. Ang together with Liow were persons who were accustomed\n\nto act on the directions and instructions of Goh. On the facts, I find that the\n\ncircumstances were not such as to put the Plaintiff upon an inquiry.27.        InSAL Industrial\n\nLeasing Ltd v Lin Hwee Guan[1998] 3 SLR 482, the Court of Appeal expressed the view\n\nthat informal assent of all the directors of a company could be tantamount to a resolution\n\nof the board. So, if an opposite view is taken that in this case the rule in Turquand was\n\ndisplaced, the Loan Agreement would still bind the Defendants if there was informal\n\nassent. It is reasonable to infer, as I do, from the objective facts in evidence that Ang\n\nwas authorised to sign the loan document even though the transaction was not formally\n\nauthorised by a resolution. It is unrealistic to reach any conclusion other than it was\n\ncarried out with the consent and knowledge of Ang and Liow. I have already found that the\n\ndirectors were aware of the loan. It is not the Defendants’ case, as will be\n\nremembered, that the security documents executed in escrow were prepared from pre-signed\n\nA4 size pieces of paper. It was in connection with the loan that all the security\n\ndocuments were created and then handed over to the Plaintiff. Having signed two\n\ndirectors’ resolutions in escrow, it is likely that Ang and Liow would, if asked to\n\ndo so, have signed the resolution approving the loan.28.        Ang and Liow were\n\nprepared to do whatever Goh required. Goh manipulated the strings and Ang and Liow\n\nresponded to the directions like puppets. Evidence of compliance is significant for the\n\nreason that it is consistent with and hence is proof of consent or acquiescence. Ang and\n\nLiow admitted that everything was done at the behest of Goh who had put in place the loan\n\nto the Defendants.29.        I, therefore, find that\n\nthe board had informally acquiesced in Ang’s acceptance of the Loan Agreement on\n\nbehalf of Biogenics. This was sufficient to vest authority in Ang. The Loan Agreement was\n\nthus binding on Biogenics.Result30.        For all these reasons, I\n\ngave judgment for the Plaintiff for the principal sum of RM7 million with costs together\n\nwith interest of RM1,361,285.01 as at 18thOctober 2002 and thereafter interest\n\nto continue at the contractual rate of 8.5% per annum until date of payment.Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
