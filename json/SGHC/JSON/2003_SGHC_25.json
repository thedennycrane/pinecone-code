        "The accused’s defence": "27.       He was at Parco Bugis Junction on 14 March to meet a client in the course of his employment as a sales executive.  The client did not keep the appointment, so he went to lunch and then went to the third level of the building. 28.       He saw M inside a shop.  They had never met before.  He saw her slip three pencils into her sling bag and he confronted her to ask her if she had taken anything without paying.  She told him that she could return everything to him, and pleaded with him not to notify her mother.  He told her to follow him because he wanted to ask her some questions.  She walked with him along the passageway, repeating her plea not to inform her mother.  When they came to the end of the passageway, they walked up a staircase.  When they reached a landing he asked for the three pencils and she handed them to him.  He also got her to write down her particulars on a business card. 29.       Then they continued on their way and went to the fan room.  When he opened the door M entered the room and closed the door.  He asked her to face the wall and remove her blouse and brassiere as well as her jeans and panties.  After she had complied he touched her breasts and her vagina.  He asked her to turn around and he saw the nipple tapes on her breasts.  He peeled off the tapes and kissed and sucked the nipples. 30.       He unzipped his pants and took out his penis, and put her hand on it.  She held it tightly and tugged it roughly.  He took her hand away and masturbated himself.  He ejaculated and some semen got on her stomach, and he wiped it with his handkerchief.  After that they both dressed up and they left the fan room. 31.       When they were back at the staircase M asked if she would get into trouble.  He assured her he would help her, but he needed to check if her theft was captured on the CCTV, and he will call her to let her know if it was, and they parted. 32.       He telephoned M the following day and told her that her theft was recorded on the CCTV, and suggested that she prepared a letter of apology and deliver it to him so that he can help her.  They agreed to meet the following day, 25 March at Ngee Ann City.  When he went there and approached her, he was arrested by the police. 33.       While he was in the custody of the police, cautioned statements were recorded from him on the two charges he faced before me.  On the attempted rape charge he stated “I maintain myself to be innocent”[10]and on the abduction charge he stated At anytime at all, I did not use any force to drag her or physically compel her to follow me.  At the point where I met her, which I asked her about the stolen items, she promptly admitted and when I asked her to follow me, she followed very anxiously and closely and if not to be seen by anyone.  We walked together towards the exit and then to the 4thlevel.  I did not drag her to the fan room.  I asked her to follow me and we were walking together side by side towards the fan room.  I was the first one to enter the fan room and she followed later and she was the one who closed the door.  I did not attempt to rape her and there was no intention to rape her at all.[11] 34.       Under cross-examination by the prosecutor, he admitted that he was not employed by the bookshop or Parco Bugis Junction as a security officer.  He also admitted that he wanted to give M the impression that he was a security officer and he had caught her stealing and she had willingly followed him at his request.[12] 35.       He denied that he thrust his penis at her vagina or had attempted to rape her.",
        "Evaluation of the evidence": "36.       By his own admission, the accused is a devious person.  He set out to deceive M into thinking that he was a security officer with access to the CCTV monitors, an office in the building, and powers to deal with shoplifters.[13]He was nothing like that.  He was a sales executive whose client had stood him up. 37.       He alleged that M had stolen some pens or pencils from the bookshop, and she denied it.  There were no investigations into this, and there was neither basis nor necessity for me to make any finding on it. 38.       It was clear that M follow the accused along the corridor, up the staircase and to the fan room because she was deceived into believing that he was a security officer.[14]The accused had therefore abducted M, as defined by s 362 of the Penal Code which states that Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person. 39.       The next issue was the purpose of the abduction.  The accused was never interested in the theft of the pens or pencils, assuming that took place and he claimed to have thrown them away.  He had lured M to the fan room to satisfy his sexual desires.  She was undressed (whether at his request or by him), and he touched her breasts and vagina and asked her to masturbate him.  M said that he also tried to thrust his penis into her vagina, but he denied that. 40.       I took particular care to observe M and the accused when they gave evidence.  M came across as a straightforward witness giving her account of the events simply and without hesitation or embellishment.  The accused was not a satisfactory witness.  He appeared to be holding back and had difficulty explaining parts of the events. 41.       I had no difficulty in believing M’s account and I found that the accused had tried to insert his penis into M’s vagina. 42.       On this basis, I found that the accused had abducted M in order that she might be forced into illicit intercourse, and I convicted him on the first charge. 43.       By those findings, the accused was also guilty of attempting to commit rape on M.  However, I was not satisfied that came within s376(2)(a) of the Penal Code which contemplates that the perpetrator voluntarily causes hurt to the victim in order to commit the offence.  Section 319 states that whoever causes bodily pain, disease or infirmity to any person is said to cause hurt. 44.       The second charge alleged that the accused caused hurt to M by using his forearm to pin her neck against the wall.  However M did not say that she experienced bodily pain because of that.  She may have felt pain, but it may also be that she did not; no evidence was adduced on this. 45.       When that was brought to the prosecutor’s attention, he did not accept that and contended that pain could be inferred.[15]I did not see any basis for doing that when M could have said that she felt pain, or could be asked if she did. 46.            Inferences are not to be drawn casually to fill gaps in the direct evidence.  It has been set down by Thomson CJ inLiew Kaling v PP(1960) 26 MLJ 306 @ 309 that to be valid an inference must (i) account for all the known facts and (ii) be the only reasonable inference which will account for all these facts.  This is a sound and prudent test, as the benefit of the doubt should be given to the defence.  When more than one reasonable inference can be drawn, some favourable to the accused and others unfavourable, the latter cannot be used against the accused.  An adverse inference can only be relied on when it is the sole irresistible inference.  Applying this test, it cannot be said that the only reasonable inference to be drawn from all the facts was that M experienced pain. 47.       I therefore found that the hurt element was not made out, and I reduced the charge to attempted simple rape under s 376(1) read with s 511.",
        "Sentence": "48.       The accused is 33 years old.  He was a sales executive but had lost the job.  He is married.  His wife is working, and they have no children.  His counsel said he was remorseful over the molestation, and pleaded for leniency. 49.       He has a bad record of convictions.  In July 1988 he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment of three months for theft.  In September 1993 he was convicted on two charges similar to those he faced at this trial.  He was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for abduction and eight years and twelve strokes for attempted rape, with the custodial sentences to run concurrently.  The victim was a 13 year old girl he accused of shoplifting and brought to a plant room and attempted to rape.  In August 1994 he was sentenced to one year imprisonment for theft and served a default sentence of one month for fraudulent possession of property. 50.       The prosecutor submitted that the accused should be sentenced to preventive detention under s 12(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code in view of his antecedents. 51.       I agreed that this was a proper case for preventive detention, and sentenced the accused to 16 years preventive detention.  In addition to that I ordered that he be given six strokes of the cane for the first offence and 12 strokes for the second offence.  He is unhappy with the convictions and the sentences and appeals against them.
