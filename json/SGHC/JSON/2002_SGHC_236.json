        "The July 1995 Meetings": "9.        On 6 July 1995, the\n\nPlaintiff met representatives of both KIML and Keppel Bank. Subsequently, Mr.Valibhoy met\n\nthe KIML representatives on 10 July 1995. KIML presented to Mr. Valibhoy a letter dated 10\n\nJuly 1995 enclosing an investment proposal for a balanced and diversified portfolio and a\n\nbrochure with biographies of its key personnel. Mr. Valibhoy at 16 of his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief said that at this meeting, both parties \"agreed on the particular\n\nallocations and the maximum amount of the fund that could be invested in equities, bonds\n\n[and] money markets respectively. If no good opportunity presented itself, the unused\n\nmonies were to be kept in fixed deposit.\"The\n\nobjectives of the investment fund as stated by Mr. Valibhoy were to be long term,\n\n\"risk – free\" ensuring preservation of capital yet at the same time earning\n\nan annual return of 7%. He also wanted to minimise personal tax liability from the\n\nreturns.10.        On 12 July 1995, Mr.\n\nValibhoy again met KIML representatives. At that meeting, he was handed an undated\n\ndocument entitled \"Investment Plan for Mr. Abdul Razak Valibhoy\" which he said\n\nwas in accordance with the investment guidelines discussed two days earlier.11.        According to Mr.\n\nValibhoy, New Zealand Dollar was added into the basket of currencies in the Investment\n\nPlan. He also told KIML that between bonds and money markets, the weightage was to be 60%\n\nmoney markets (including fixed deposits) and 40% bond markets.12.        Both Mr. Valibhoy and\n\nKIML signed the Investment Agreement on 12 July 1995.",
        "Unauthorised Investments and Excess of Mandate": "13.        The Plaintiff’s\n\nallegation is that KIML in not following the asset allocation in the Investment Plan had\n\nacted without his authorisation or outside of the agreed mandate. Counsel for the\n\nPlaintiff, Mr. Peter Gabriel, submitted that the crux of the dispute on authority is\n\nwhether:(i) the Investment Plan was a collateral contract whereby the parties\n\n    had agreed on the maximum asset allocation of the Fund that could be invested in equities,\n\n    bonds and money markets respectively or;(ii) the Investment Plan constituted the Plaintiff’s written\n\n    instructions under the Investment Agreement dated 12 July 1995.14.        These two questions\n\npresuppose a finding that the Investment Agreement dated 12 July 1995 was the only\n\ndocument governing the rights and obligations of the parties. The Plaintiff’s pleaded\n\ncase is that the agreement governing the rights and obligations of the parties was\n\nevidenced by and/or contained in KIML’s letter dated 10 July 1995, the Investment\n\nPlan and the Investment Agreement dated 12 July 1995.15.        The Plaintiff’s bare\n\nassertion that the agreement was partly made orally at the 10 July 1995 meeting at\n\nKIML’s office was abandoned at the trial. That decision foreshadows the shortcomings\n\nof the Plaintiff’s case as pleaded - not only for what it alleges but also for what\n\nit does not allege.16.        In my view, the letter of\n\n10 July 1995 was simply that of a covering letter. The statements in there were part and\n\nparcel of a normal \"sales pitch\" prior to any engagement. More importantly, Mr.\n\nValibhoy was given a copy of the Investment Agreement on 10 July 1995 to review and that\n\nevinced a clear intention to embody the terms of the appointment in a formal contract. I\n\nwill say more about the Investment Plan below. Suffice it to say that the letter of 10\n\nJuly and Investment Plan were essentially pre-contract documents.17.        Through the Investment\n\nAgreement, Mr. Valibhoy appointed KIML investment manager of the Fund. In my judgment, the\n\nInvestment Agreement constituted the entire agreement between the parties. It was the\n\nconcluded formal document containing the contractual terms to which the parties agreed to\n\nbind themselves. The Investment Agreement superseded the pre-contract documents and\n\ndiscussions.(i)Collateral Agreement18.         11 of the Amended\n\nStatement of Claim reads:\"Further or in the alternative, the Investment Plan contained\n\n    and/or evidenced an agreement collateral and/or ancillary to the Agreement whereby the\n\n    Plaintiff and the Defendants agreed on themaximumproportions of the Fund thatcouldbe invested in equities, bonds and money markets respectively.\"19.        Generally, a collateral\n\ncontract involves as consideration the making of some other contract (the principal\n\ncontract) so that a statement made before or at the time for entry into the principal\n\ncontract is enforceable. The Plaintiff as the party seeking to rely on the collateral\n\ncontract bears the burden of establishing thatbothparties intended to create a\n\nlegally binding contract: Ralph Gibson LJ inKleinworth Benson Ltd v Malaysian Mining\n\nCorporation Berhad[1989] 1 All E.R. 785 at 796.20.        Mr. Valibhoy’s\n\nwritten testimony contradicted his contention that the Investment Plan evinced a\n\ncollateral contract. In  25, he said that the undated Investment Plan was an integral\n\npart of the Investment Agreement and the Investment Plan represented his specific\n\ninstructions to KIML as regards his \"investment requirements, the particular\n\nallocation of the Fund and the maximum proportions of the Fund which could be invested in\n\nequities, bonds and money markets respectively\".21.        In my judgment, the\n\nevidence adduced by the Plaintiff fell short of establishing any warranty or promise, let\n\nalone any warranty or promise intended to be acted on or which the Plaintiff could rely\n\nwhen he signed the Investment Agreement. What if any of the representatives from KIML said\n\nwas not pleaded nor adduced in evidence. The question to be decided in every case is - did\n\nthe parties intend the statement(s) to have contractual effect and be legally binding? If\n\nthey did then an enforceable collateral contract arises. The statement(s) must take effect\n\nas a term or terms of the collateral contract. Without pleading and leading evidence on\n\nwhat was said by KIML, it is not possible to decide the effect in law of the statement(s).22.        In the result, the\n\nPlaintiff had not established the existence of a collateral contract contained in or\n\nevidenced by the Investment Plan.(ii)Investment Plan (undated and unsigned)23.        Mr. Gabriel submitted\n\nthat KIML’s discretion in the Investment Agreement to invest in any market and asset\n\nclass was fettered or varied by the Investment Plan. The Investment Plan was Mr.\n\nValibhoy’s written instruction to KIML under Clause 2 of the Investment Agreement (VN p 614). The Plaintiff averred in 12 of the Amended Statement of Claim\n\nthat the Investment Plan was Mr. Valibhoy’s written instruction under Clause 7(4) of\n\nthe Investment Agreement.24.        Clause 7(4) of the\n\nInvestment Agreement was not expressed in mandatory terms. By Clause 7(4), KIMPL\n\n\"may\" and not \"must\" or \"will\" comply with the instructions.\n\nIn fact, it is in KIML’s discretion not only to decide whether or not to assent to\n\nthe instructions concerning the investment of the funds but when to act on the\n\ninstructions. Further, if it so decides to act on the instructions, the investor is to\n\nindemnify KIML for undertaking those instructions.25.        Mr. Gabriel argued that\n\nthe Investment Plan was necessary as the Investment Agreement lacked details of the asset\n\nallocation. It was Mr. Valibhoy’s framework on how the investments should be carried\n\nout and for KIML to comply. Mr. Gabriel submitted that as far as Mr. Valibhoy was\n\nconcerned, his understanding of what transpired at the meeting on 12 July 1995 was that\n\nhis investment guidelines were there for KIML to follow and KIML would exercise its\n\ndiscretion pursuant to it and not beyond it.26.        It is necessary to bear\n\nin mind KIML’s investment methodology. Mr. Valibhoy had seen KIML’s literature\n\non this as early as 10 July 1995. He referred to and quoted in his written testimony those\n\nparts that were important to him. The proportion of funds to be invested in the different\n\nmarkets and asset classes would broadly be identified by KIML. The allocation and mix of\n\nasset classes would be monitored and adjusted regularly depending on KIML’s\n\nassessment of the prevailing economic outlook and market conditions. Therefore, to\n\neffectively invest and manage the funds properly, flexibility is crucial and to KIML the\n\nkey is absolute discretion over the management of the Fund.27.        If as Mr. Gabriel\n\ncontended, given the importance of the Investment Plan to the Plaintiff as his investment\n\nframework for KIML, a reasonable investor like the Plaintiff would have insisted on\n\ncertainty in relation to the Investment Plan. He was after all placing the bulk of his\n\ninheritance in KIML’s hands. Mr. Valibhoy did not offer any reason as to why the\n\nInvestment Plan was not included or incorporated into the Investment Agreement. The\n\nInvestment Agreement, in particular Clause 12, could have been but was not amended to\n\ninclude the undated Investment Plan as an additional restriction prior to execution of the\n\nInvestment Agreement. Furthermore, the Investment Plan was unsigned and undated. There was\n\nno appropriately worded notation on the document itself or even a side letter from the\n\nPlaintiff or KIML about the Investment Plan. It was not suggested that there was no\n\nopportunity at that meeting to take any of these steps.28.        Throughout their fund\n\nmanagement relationship, the Investment Plan was never once mentioned or referred in any\n\ncommunication. The Plaintiff had never in the past complained about KIML’s\n\n\"deviation\" from the Investment Plan nor queried the unauthorised investments\n\nmade by KIML. There was no mention of unauthorised transactions when he instructed KIML in\n\nMay 2000 to dispose of investments in China and Hong Kong.29.        Mr. Shanmugam submitted\n\nthat the Investment Plan, which was unsigned and undated, was not Mr. Valibhoy’s\n\nwritten instruction to KIML. The Investment Plan was no different from a variety of\n\ninvestment proposals that were put forward by KIML at different times. Further, those\n\ninvestment proposals would necessarily change with effluxion of time and market\n\nvicissitudes.30.        Mr. Shanmugam drew my\n\nattention to the actual investment pattern of the Fund. Almost from the beginning, the\n\nactual investment pattern was not the same as the Investment Plan (see CB tab 8).31.        Given KIML’s\n\ninvestment methodology, the Investment Plan could not really have been Mr. Valibhoy’s\n\nmandate to KIML. It would be commercially unreal to suggest that the Investment Plan was\n\nthe Plaintiff’s long-term instruction. It would flout business common sense to\n\nconstrue the Investment Plan in that way. The Investment Plan could only at best operate\n\nfor a while as a guide in the exercise of KIML’s discretion but not as a fetter.32.        I find that the\n\nInvestment Plan was not a written direction or specific instruction from Mr. Valibhoy\n\ngiven pursuant to either Clause 2 or 7(4) of the Investment Agreement. The Plaintiff had\n\nnot on the balance of probabilities made out a prima facie case that the discretion vested\n\nin KIML by the Investment Agreement was restricted or varied by the undated and unsigned\n\nInvestment Plan.  There was no evidence that the Investment Agreement by mutual\n\nconsent had been supplemented or amended by the Investment Plan (see Clause 18 of the\n\nInvestment Agreement).(iii)Knowledge of the Plaintiff and Investment\n\nAgreement(a)Quality of the Plaintiff’s evidence33.        On the issue of the\n\nPlaintiff’s knowledge of the various investments, it is necessary to say something\n\nabout the quality of the Plaintiff’s evidence. Whether or not I accept his evidence\n\nmust depend not only on my impression as to the reliability of his evidence, but also upon\n\nthe underlying probabilities in the light of the relevant and admissible contemporaneous\n\ndocuments and other surrounding circumstances.34.        Mr. Valibhoy gave\n\nevidence for two days. He tried to portray himself as a sick old man neither bothering\n\nwith details nor looking at the individual investments in the weekly and monthly\n\nstatements and, therefore, did not know what investments he had. Occasionally, he would go\n\nthrough the profit/loss column in the monthly statements and, if he came across an item\n\nthat had done particularly well or badly, he would call KIML for information. Basically,\n\nhe had trusted and left everything to the professional fund manager who had basically let\n\nhim down.35.        Having seen and heard\n\nhim, I found him an unsatisfactory and unreliable witness. He was often defensive and\n\nargumentative. He frequently gave unnecessarily lengthy explanation to straightforward\n\nquestions. There were times when his answers were incredible as when he maintained that he\n\nread only the bottom line of the monthly statements and closed his eyes to the rest of the\n\ninformation on the same page. At times, his answers came across as defiant and arrogant as\n\nwhen he did not see a need to complain to KIML about the unauthorised investments.36.        He often prevaricated. At\n\ntimes, he was unwilling to agree to matters unless they could be proven against on the\n\ndocuments. And, when confronted with documents, he would try to extricate himself from his\n\nearlier testimony that was demonstrably wrong thereby damaging his credibility as an\n\nhonest and reliable witness.37.        Even on his illness,\n\nthere was conflicting evidence. In his written testimony he said he suffered a heart\n\nattack in the last quarter of 1996. However, in the witness box, he said that his heart\n\nattack was in March 1996.38.        Mr. Valibhoy claimed to\n\nhave taken a \"hands-off\" approach with KIML until around the last quarter of\n\n1997. I find his \"hands-off\" testimony, as he would want the court to believe,\n\nimplausible especially so in the early phase of a new relationship that involved a\n\nsignificant amount of his inheritance.39.        He was as with any other\n\ntypical investor anxious about his investments. He demanded weekly updates preferring not\n\nto wait for monthly reports. He even asked for the weekly statements to be sent to him\n\nwhenever he was in Malaysia. A reasonable private investor in the position of Mr. Valibhoy\n\nwould probably pay attention to the weekly reports since it was a service specially\n\nrequested by him. He admitted calling Gina Chan of KIML if he had any queries.40.        I find that he was far\n\nfrom being an unsophisticated investor as he made himself out to be. Prior to his\n\nrelationship with KIML, Mr. Valibhoy was investing in quoted equities in the Singapore and\n\nMalaysian stock markets as well as in the forex market. According to KIML’s Call\n\nReport dated 6 July 1995, Mr. Valibhoy’s exposure on his foreign exchange trading\n\naccount with the treasury department of Keppel Bank at that time was S$6m.41.        Overall, Mr. Valibhoy did\n\nnot give his evidence in a fair, moderate and convincing way. His testimony lacked\n\ncandour. His confusion or forgetfulness (whether genuine or feigned) on material aspects\n\nof his case did not help his case.(b)Knowledge of the Plaintiff42.        Under Clause 13 of the\n\nInvestment Agreement, KIML would have to and did provide Mr. Valibhoy with monthly\n\nstatements of the investments in the portfolio. It was not disputed that Mr. Valibhoy\n\nreceived the monthly statements, which contained details of purchases/sales of investments\n\nmade during the relevant month. The purchases/sales were classified by country, counter,\n\ntransaction price and so on. The monthly statements would also contain details of all\n\nasset holdings as at that particular month end, interest received on cash and bonds,\n\ndividends received together with withholding tax, cash balance, net asset value, pre-tax\n\nreturn and profitability analysis on every class of asset and total profit or loss.43.        The weekly report covered\n\ntransactions made during a five-day period. It gave the dates of purchases/sales over any\n\ngiven week, the counter and country where the purchases/sales had taken place, quantity,\n\nunit price and total cost (in two currencies) of the purchases/sales together with the\n\ndeal reference number.44.        Mr. Valibhoy maintained\n\nthat he did not read the monthly and weekly statements in detail and thus never knew (and\n\nhence did not complain) that KIML were acting without authority. There can be no truth to\n\nhis denial. It would be second nature for a person with his background to be curious about\n\nthe types and magnitude of the transactions apart from just noting the losses and gains45.        He knew the purpose of\n\nKIML’s weekly and monthly statements. So even if he did not read them carefully or at\n\nall, the weekly and monthly statements would still have the effect intended and would\n\nserve the purpose for which they were sent:Banque Nationale de Paris v Tan Nancy &\n\nAnor[2002] 1 SLR 29. In that case, the defendants disclaimed any knowledge of what\n\nwas going on because the statements, credit and debit advices etc sent to the defendants\n\nby the bank were either unopened or unread. The Court of Appeal rejected it as a valid\n\nground for denying knowledge about the transactions notified in the statements and other\n\ndocuments sent by the bank. It was to Mr. Valibhoy’s own detriment that he did not\n\nprotest, complain or query KIML about the unauthorised transactions. See for exampleOng\n\n& Co Pte Ltd v Foo Sae Heng[1990] SLR 186;RHB-Cathy Securities Pte Ltd v\n\nIbrahim Khan & Ors[1999] 3 SLR 464.(c)Investments were authorised46.        Under the Investment\n\nAgreement, KIML was expressly empowered to manage for Mr. Valibhoy on a fully\n\ndiscretionary basis, a portfolio of equity, bond and foreign exchange investments. KIML\n\nhad full authority and discretion to without prior reference to Mr. Valibhoy enter into\n\nany kind of authorised investment defined in Clause 1 of the Investment Agreement. The\n\nrange of permitted investments under the Investment Agreement was extensive and KIML was\n\ngiven absolute discretion to decide on the spread and balance of the portfolio. The\n\nobjective was to achieve \"as high a total return consistent with capital\n\npreservation\" (see Clause 7(1)(a)). Elsewhere, the Investment Agreement was subject\n\nto written directions from the Plaintiff, restrictions in Clause 12 and limitations set\n\nout therein. As illustration, KIML was subject to an obligation to exercise the\n\ndiscretionary power with reasonable care, skill, good faith and owe duties of a fiduciary.\n\nThese obligations are all expressly stated in Clause 7(2) of the Investment Agreement.47.        It would be fair to say\n\nthat before December 1997, Mr. Valibhoy was generally pleased with the Fund’s\n\nperformance and was content with the returns. About one year after KIML’s\n\nappointment, he was able to and did withdraw S$1.7m profits from the Fund. In September\n\n1997, he added RM 10m to the Fund.48.        In my judgment, the\n\ninvestments were made by KIML in exercise of its discretion and were authorised under the\n\nInvestment Agreement. I find that Mr. Valibhoy knew or was aware what investments were\n\nmade by KIML under the Investment Agreement. Overall, I am satisfied that he had by his\n\nconduct accepted the investments made by KIML.49.        In fact, Mr. Valibhoy is\n\ndeemed under the Investment Agreement to have given permission for the investments made by\n\nKIML (see Clause 7(3)). At all times he acted as if the Investment Agreement was clear and\n\nbinding. In the circumstances, he has no right to complain and his action must fail\n\ncompletely.(d)3rdJanuary 1996 mandate- Hong Kong\n\nequities up to S$1 million50.        On the second day of\n\nhearing, the Plaintiff introduced the instance of the investment cap of S$1m on Hong Kong\n\nequities by way of amendment to the Further & Better Particulars. The Plaintiff’s\n\ncase is that Hong Kong was not originally in the Investment Plan. On 3 January 1996, a\n\nwritten mandate of S$1m was given to KIML to invest in Hong Kong equities.51.        The case that was put\n\nforward before the court was that all transactions exceeding this mandate of S$1m\n\nconstituted unauthorised dealings or were dealings outside the mandate. While in the\n\nwitness box, Mr. Valibhoy surprisingly disclosed that there was another mandate of S$3m. I\n\nwas therefore not persuaded that the mandate for Hong Kong equities remained static at\n\nS$1m.52.        Mr. Valibhoy claimed that\n\nhe only concentrated on the profit/loss column of the monthly statements. He stated in his\n\nwritten testimony that he usually looked at the overall performance of the Fund. Even if\n\nthat were true, the returns from the Hong Kong equities would have alerted him that the\n\nFund’s holding of Hong Kong equities must have exceeded S$1m. As an illustration, the\n\nvalue of the Fund, as at August 1997 was $32,394,312.65 of which the Fund held S$5,655,063\n\nworth of Hong Kong equities and profits of S$1,009,530.13 were realised under Hong Kong\n\nequities during the month of August 1997. It is not in dispute that he did not query or\n\ncomplain to KIML about the purchases.53.        By comparison to other\n\nmarkets, Hong Kong was the best performing regional market during the period 31 July 1995\n\nto 30 November 2000 with the Hang Seng Index rising by 85% in S$ terms (CB tab 23).54.        The Manager’s Report\n\ndated 31 July 1997 showed the performance of the Fund as measured against the performance\n\nof a constructed Composite Benchmark Return. Since its inception in July 1995 to 30 June\n\n1997, the Fund increased by 17.61% compared to 9.04% for the constructed Composite\n\nBenchmark Return (see DB 2658).55.        Additionally, the\n\nPlaintiff would have known from the investment proposal dated 20 May 1996 (and I\n\ndisbelieve Mr. Valibhoy’s testimony on this issue) that KIML recommended a further\n\nS$2m to be invested in Hong Kong equities (see DB 2648).56.        In September 1997,\n\nanother investment proposal was given to Mr. Valibhoy (DB 2673). Under the proposal, asset\n\nallocated to equities accounted for 42% of the Fund with the recommendation for 55% of the\n\nallocation to equities earmarked for Hong Kong equities (DB 2674/2675).57.        Contrary to his professed\n\nlack of interest in detail, he was personally tracking his Hong Kong investments by\n\nsubscribing to \"Live Quotes\" i.e. live stock price information from the Hong\n\nKong market. He admitted to asking KIML for stock number code of the various Hong Kong\n\nequities in his portfolio so as to be in the know and/or to track their performance on his\n\ncomputer. He accepted that he would call KIML to follow the price movement of specific\n\nstocks. He admitted during cross-examination that he wanted to find out \"how the\n\nmarkets are doing\" (VN p 407).(e)Other Issues58.        The Plaintiff’s\n\nclaim is supposedly for losses relating to unauthorised transactions. Using Hong Kong as\n\nillustration, the Plaintiff’s claim is for losses in the months ofSeptember\n\n1996, December 1996 and October 1997. It was not explained why no claims were made in this\n\naction for the other months like May 1996, June 1996 and November 1997 when they were\n\nsimilarly unauthorised and there were also losses. Theseinconsistencies are not\n\njust peculiar to the Hong Kong equities.59.        Mr. Shanmugam singled out\n\nthe China Unicom claim as dishonest. Of the 150,000 shares (which were said to be\n\nunauthorised) two out of the three lots (about 110,000 shares) sold at different times\n\nwere profitable. The third lot was sold at a loss and the Plaintiff’s claim is for\n\nthis loss, totally ignoring the profit on the earlier sales of 110,000 shares. In my\n\njudgment, how the losses in the action arose and are computed and whether they arose as a\n\nresult of purchases outside of mandate have not been adequately pleaded and established.60.        The Plaintiff had refused\n\nto deliver Further & Better Particulars of the losses pleaded in paragraph 21 of the\n\nAmended Statement of Claim. The Plaintiff was requested to identify the investments, the\n\nquantities, dates and prices at which they were bought and sold, and to provide a\n\nbreakdown and details of how the alleged loss was computed.61.        Mr. Gabriel submitted\n\nthat Mr. Valibhoy is claiming general damages, not special damages and therefore there was\n\nno need to give particulars. I agree with Mr. Shanmugan that the Plaintiff’s claims\n\nare in the nature of special damages and they must be pleaded with sufficient\n\nparticularity:Mount Elizabeth Health Centre Pte Ltd v Mount Elizabeth Hospital Ltd[1993] 1SLR 1021. The appellate court inPerestrello E Companhia Limitada v United Paint Co\n\nLtd[1969] 3 All ER 479 held that where the amount claimed could be calculated, the\n\nclaimant must give particulars of how the item is calculated so as to give fair warning to\n\nthe defendant of the case he is to meet. This requirement is not restricted to a claim for\n\nspecial damages. It is equally applicable where justice of the particular case so requires\n\n(as in the present case) without which the nature of the claim is not properly disclosed\n\nand defendant does not know what to expect.",
        "No timely disposal of Hong Kong equities": "62.        The allegation is that\n\nKIML failed to liquidate his investments in Hong Kong by 31 May 2000.63.        A discretion, for\n\nexample, to trade is precisely that: a discretion, and not an obligation. KIML was not\n\nobliged to dispose of the shares had it in its discretion felt it inappropriate to do so.\n\nThe Plaintiff had not satisfied me that KIML’s letter of 9 May 2000 (DB 359) turned\n\nthe discretion in Clause 7(4) to an obligation to dispose of the shares by 31 May 2000\n\nwithout regard to the prevailing market conditions and future economic and market outlook.64.        Besides, Mr. Valibhoy\n\nsubsequently never complained that the stocks were not disposed by 31 May 2000. He\n\ncontinued to receive regular weekly and monthly reports, which would have revealed that\n\nthose counters remained in the Fund. In December 2000, he did not query KIML as to why the\n\nstocks were not sold and had simply directed that they be transferred to Citibank NA.65.        During the trial, the\n\nPlaintiff disclosed that some of the shares had not been sold. It is a fact that the\n\nPlaintiff cannot claim for losses not suffered. The Plaintiff had not proven on the\n\nbalance of probabilities that KIML’s failure to dispose of the investments between 9\n\nand 31 May 2000 caused his loss.",
        "Tax Exposure": "66.        Mr. Valibhoy was aware\n\nand accepted that KIML had no obligation under the Investment Agreement to tax plan. The\n\nPlaintiff had not identified and proven the legal basis for his claim. Neither had the\n\nPlaintiff pleaded and proven the breach and loss. The mere production of Notices of\n\nAssessment (additional or amended) was not enough to prove his increased tax exposure. The\n\nPlaintiff did not identify those remittances that are the subject matter of his complaint.\n\nHe also led no evidence on when and how much of the taxable income was remitted to\n\nSingapore and to what extent that had increased his tax exposure and liability.",
        "Ciputra Notes": "67.        Ciputra Notes (\"the\n\nNotes\") were US$100 million interest bearing bonds issued by Ciputra Development\n\nInternational Finance B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of PT Ciputra Development, an\n\nIndonesian listed company. The Notes were guaranteed by PT Ciputra Development. It was not\n\ndisputed that PT Ciputra Development was at that time the largest listed property player\n\nin Indonesia and was perceived as a blue chip company. The company was involved in various\n\nresidential, commercial and industrial property developments.68.        The Notes were managed\n\nand arranged by a consortium of financial institutions including Keppel Bank. The\n\nPlaintiff was allocated and issued with US$2m worth of Notes on 24 July 1995.69.        During the 1997/1998\n\nAsian financial crisis, the Indonesian Rupiah depreciated sharply against the US Dollar.\n\nThe issuer defaulted and the Notes were not redeemed in July 2001.70.        The Plaintiff’s case\n\nis that KIML had acted in breach of trust and/or fiduciary duty and/or were negligent in\n\nthat KIML:(i) by purchasing the Notes placed itself in a position where its own\n\n    interest or interest of Keppel Bank conflicted with those of the Plaintiff. The purchase\n\n    of the Notes was not in the interests of the Plaintiff;(ii) the purchase was not an investment made in good faith as KIML\n\n    knowingly and intentionally assisted and/or preferred the interests of Keppel Bank as the\n\n    Arranger and Manager of the issue of the Notes to those of the Plaintiff;(iii) failed to disclose its interest in the issue of the Notes in\n\n    particular the role of Keppel Bank in the issue of the Notes;(iv) failed to make any or any adequate inquiry in order to established\n\n    the precise nature of the issue of the Notes;(v) invested in the Notes well knowing that the Plaintiff was relying\n\n    on its skill, knowledge and judgment to give him sound advice in such matters;(vi) failed to recommend a sound investment which would have suited the\n\n    Plaintiff’s express needs as had been requested by the Plaintiff at the outset and;(vii) failed to have a reasonable basis for making the recommendation\n\n    to purchase the Notes.(see paragraph 20(i) to (u) of Amended Statement of Claim)(i)Breach of Fiduciary Duty and/or Trust71.        Clause 7(2) of the\n\nInvestment Agreement provides that in accepting the appointment, KIML undertakes to\n\nexercise fiduciary duties with care and diligence. This clause renders it unnecessary to\n\nlook at the acts and circumstances to determine whether in fact a fiduciary relationship\n\nexist between the investor and investment manager. Whether founded on a breach of\n\nfiduciary duty under Clause 7(2) or breach of trust as alleged, the underlying rule in\n\nthat a fiduciary or trustee must not place himself in a position where his duty and\n\ninterest may conflict.72.        The Investment Agreement\n\nsets out the framework as to whether or not there is a conflict of interest. The conflict\n\nin question as provided by Clause 10(1), is a \"real likelihood of conflict of\n\ninterest\" which is of the kind enunciated by Lord Upjohn inBoardman & Anor v\n\nPhipps[1967] 2 AC 46 and is now the generally accepted approach. Lord Upjohn said:\"In my view [the phrase ‘possibly may conflict’] means\n\n    that the reasonable man looking at the relevant facts and circumstances of the particular\n\n    case would think that there was a real sensible possibility of conflict; not that you\n\n    could imagine some situation arising which might, in some conceivable possibility in\n\n    events not contemplated as real sensible possibilities by any reasonable person, result in\n\n    a conflict.\" [p124]73.        The question whether or\n\nnot there is a real likelihood of conflict of interest is a question of fact. Wherein then\n\nlies the conflict?74.        The Plaintiff submitted\n\nthat by taking up the Notes for Mr. Valibhoy, Keppel Bank’s underwriting obligation\n\nwas thus correspondingly reduced. KIML as trustee/fiduciary had put itself in a position\n\nof conflict as it had bought the Notes to benefit Keppel Bank. KIML as a wholly owned\n\nsubsidiary of Keppel Bank therefore acted contrary to the interest of the Plaintiff. The\n\nPlaintiff’s case is that a benefit to Keppel Bank is in itself a benefit to KIML as\n\nthe latter as a member of the Keppel Bank group of companies.75.        The submissions are pure\n\nconjectures. The existence of a holding-subsidiary relationship did not ipso facto create\n\na conflict of interest. There was no evidence of that the Notes were undersubscribed.\n\nThere was no evidence that Keppel Bank had in fact benefited from KIML’s purchase of\n\nthe Notes on behalf of the Fund. There is no suggestion that it was a case of Keppel Bank\n\ndesperate to offload and KIML bought the Notes to help out Keppel Bank. There was no\n\nevidence that the management of Keppel Bank made the decision for KIML. The Plaintiff led\n\nno evidence of real likelihood of conflict of interest. On the other hand, it may be\n\ninferred from the evidence that the Plaintiff did not consider the identity of the\n\nunderwriter a matter of importance. Mr. Valibhoy was asked during cross-examination what\n\nwas important to him in a bond issue. His answer was the currency of the bond, the\n\ninterest rate and the issuer (VN p 515-516).76.        It is the\n\nPlaintiff’s case that he never knew about the facts relating to acquisition of the\n\nNotes. Mr. Valibhoy asserted that he was not told about Keppel Bank’s involvement in\n\nthe Notes.77.        The purchase of the\n\nNotes, its value were notified vide Portfolio Valuation Statement dated 31 July 1995 and\n\nthereafter in the weekly and monthly reports. Mr. Valibhoy was also provided with the\n\nmarket valuation of the Notes. Mr. Valibhoy was interested in investing in Indonesia and\n\nin property. Mr. Valibhoy said he remembered asking Gina Chan about this company. The\n\nPlaintiff was told that it was an Indonesian company and that KIML had invested in bonds\n\nissued by Ciputra. The Notes were denominated in US Dollars.78.        I am not satisfied that\n\nMr. Valibhoy’s recollection of his conversation with Gina Chan was limited to what he\n\nhad told the court. It is not improbable that he was told that Keppel Bank was the\n\nunderwriter but he had forgotten about it. Overall, Mr. Valibhoy appeared to have accepted\n\nthe Notes on the face of it. He cannot complain in causative terms of what he knew was the\n\nposition79.        The Plaintiff did not\n\nestablish at all that the Notes when they were bought were not in his interest. The Notes\n\noffered high interest rates, which ranged from 7.675% to 8.2375% per annum (CB tab 19). He\n\nreceived interest totalling US$325,867.99 (equivalent to S$465,619.78) between January\n\n1996 and July 1997 from this investment of US$2m.80.        Market opinion at that\n\ntime on PT Ciputra Development was favourable. It may be inferred from the fact that\n\nKeppel Bank, other banks and financial institutions took up the Notes (DB 2269) that the\n\nNotes were supported and well regarded by Keppel Bank as well as by other financial\n\ninstitutions to be a good investment. It was the perception of those in Keppel Bank that\n\nIndonesian bonds were very much sought after at the time including the Notes although it\n\nwas not rated (DB 2146).81.        The Plaintiff had made a\n\nbare allegation of bad faith on the part of KIML (see paragraph 20 (p)). Such a plea is\n\nessentially one of dishonesty and without particulars, this allegations fails:The\n\nSupreme Court Practice 1999vol. 1 18/12/14;.Lewin on Trust (17th ed)40-32.\n\nIn any event, the Plaintiff had not shown the causative link between the alleged breach of\n\nduty and the Plaintiff’s loss of investment. At that time the fortunes of Ciputra\n\nlike many others in Indonesia were severely affected by the Asian financial crisis and the\n\nconsequential meltdown of the Indonesian economy. Nobody foresaw the end of the Suharto\n\nera. In a claim for equitable compensation, causation and the need for a plaintiff to\n\nprove his loss are necessary.",
        "Amendments to Further & Better Particulars": "82.        KIML had previously\n\nrequested particulars of paragraph 20 (o), (p), (q), (r), (t) and (u) of the Amended\n\nStatement of Claim. The Plaintiff provided some particulars of sub-paragraph (t) but\n\nrefused the rest on the ground that the facts had been sufficiently pleaded and/or the\n\nrequest was for evidence.83.        Since then, Mr. Shanmugam\n\nhad unsuccessfully pressed Mr. Valibhoy’s legal advisers for an identification of the\n\nreal issues at stake. On the second day of the trial, the Plaintiff applied for leave to\n\namend his Further & Better Particulars dated 17 January 2002. I refused the\n\nPlaintiff’s application to amend paragraph 20 (t) and (u) and he has appealed against\n\nmy decision.84.        The amendments sought\n\nwere as follows:\"(i) The Ciputra Group had a substantial currency risk in that\n\n    substantial assets and revenues were in Indonesian Rupiah but liabilities and interest\n\n    were in US Dollars. There was no hedging against this currency risk.(ii) 80% of the Ciputra Group were owned by family related entities;(iii) 7 out of 9 directors of Ciputra Development were family\n\n    members.\"85.        Mr. Gabriel argued that\n\nthe amendments were necessitated by Gina Chan’s supplemental affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief. The Plaintiff’s contention is untenable. In my view it was too\n\nlate for the amendments to be made. The court is normally slow to allow amendments at the\n\ntrial stage in respect of matters apparent to the Plaintiff a long time ago. SeeThe\n\nSupreme Court Practice 1999 vol. 120/8/11; Hong Leong Finance Ltd v Famco (S)\n\nPte Ltd[1992] 2 SLR 1108. The proposed amendments came from the Offering Circular\n\nthat was discovered in December 2001. The Plaintiff had this document in his own list of\n\ndocuments before KIML gave discovery. Mr. Valibhoy admitted receiving from Citibank NA a\n\ncopy each of the Offering Circular and Bloomberg Report dated 27 July 1995 before he filed\n\nhis claim. Like the defendants inGoh Kim Hai v Pacific Can Investment Holdings Ltd[1996] 2 SLR 109, the Plaintiff has had many opportunities to put forward his case so much so\n\nthat he must be held strictly to what has been previously stated.86.        The amendments, if\n\nallowed, would cause injustice to KIML who would have to defend what would essentially be\n\na different case based on negligence. If the amendments were allowed, KIML would have to\n\nbe afforded an opportunity to prepare and call witnesses to challenge the Plaintiffs on\n\nthese allegations which happened some seven years ago. That in turn would have\n\nnecessitated vacating the trial. It did not seem right to allow that to happen at so late\n\na stage especially when the amendments sought by the Plaintiff were previously requested\n\nbut refused.87.        In any case, the proposed\n\namendments would not aid the Plaintiff. To succeed on his claim in negligence, the\n\nPlaintiff must, but did not, plead that no reasonable fund manager would in the\n\ncircumstances have purchased the Notes. He also did not plead the damage resulting from\n\nthe breach of duty of care. Be that as it may, there was no evidence to suggest a factual\n\nbasis for such a plea. To permit the amendments would in effect be allowing the Plaintiff\n\nto plead a cause of action that was on the facts not open to him. In that sense, the cause\n\nof action in negligence was not made out.88.        In the circumstances, I\n\ndisallowed the Plaintiff’s application to amend sub-paragraphs 20(t) and (u) of the\n\nFurther & Better Particulars.",
        "Admissibility of Expert Evidence": "89.        Before the Plaintiff led\n\nevidence, the Defendants applied on the third day of the trial for the Affidavits of Peter\n\nDouglas and Henry Tan (three in number) to be ruled inadmissible and excluded from these\n\nproceedings.90.        After hearing Counsel and\n\nreviewing the affidavits in question, I found KIML’s complaints valid and allowed\n\nKIML’s application. The Plaintiff has appealed against my decision.91.        As to whether KIML acted\n\nwithout authority that was a question for the court to decide and not a matter for expert\n\nevidence. Henry Tan and Peter Douglas overreached their function as experts in that they\n\nhad in their respective conclusions transgressed into the exclusive province of the court\n\nfor the determination of questions of fact and law. SeeSarkar’s Law of Evidencepp871, 883;Joseph Crosfield & Sons Ltd v Techno-Chemical Laboratories Ltd(1913)\n\n29 TLR 378;Yewdale v Insurance Corporation[1995] ACWSJ LEXIS 45538. An expert\n\ncould not assist the court in its interpretation of a document, as it is a matter for the\n\ncourt to read the language of the agreement or document, to analyse the facts and apply\n\nthe law to the facts.92.        The affidavits of Peter\n\nDouglas were not confined to the issues before the court. They went beyond the\n\nPlaintiff’s pleaded case and were therefore irrelevant. In determining whether expert\n\nevidence is admissible, the criteria of relevance and necessity must be considered. SeeMathew\n\nv Canada[2001] ACWSJ LEXIS 16589. On the calculations in Henry Tan’s affidavit,\n\nthey are the result of an arithmetical exercise and did not satisfy the criterion of\n\nnecessity. SeeMathew v Canada22. Given the issues in the pleaded case, the\n\ncourt would not be assisted by these experts. The court is able to form its own\n\nconclusions on the issues and work out the arithmetic without the opinion of the experts.",
        "Set-off": "93.        The Plaintiff’s\n\ncontention is that as the claims were in respect of distinct and separate causes of\n\naction, he is not required to set-off or give credit for the gains against the losses.94.      InBrown v KMR Services Ltd[1995] 4 All ER 598, no set-off or credit was given against losses in underwriting years 1988,\n\n1989 and 1990 for the profits made on those syndicates in 1986 and 1987 as the plaintiff\n\nhad an independent cause of action in respect of each separate contractual year. Each\n\ncause of action gave a right in law to recover damages which the plaintiff had suffered by\n\nreason of the breach of contract.95.        The facts of the present\n\ncase showed that the investing and management of a portfolio of investments based on the\n\nInvestment Agreement is that of an ongoing account. The performance of the portfolio and\n\nindeed the categories of investment within are to be looked upon as a whole in that\n\nprofits and losses arising from disposals of investments must be aggregated. Each purchase\n\nof investment cannot be realistically viewed as a single and separate transaction for\n\npurposes of ascertaining the true position of the portfolio or category of investments.\n\nTherefore, it is only correct that profits and losses arising out of the disposal of\n\ninvestments based on an ongoing account in the case of a portfolio of investments are to\n\nbe set-off in order to determine the real position.Brown v KMR Services Ltd,which\n\nis relied upon by the Plaintiff, is distinguishable on the facts and does not assist the\n\nPlaintiff.96.        Accordingly, the net\n\namount after set-off for all transactions is a profit of $3,930,567.37. At the end of the\n\nday, the Plaintiff had suffered no loss. And even if KIML had committed a breach of\n\ncontract and/or duty of a trustee or fiduciary, KIML would be under no liability to\n\ncompensate the Plaintiff. I would mention that the Plaintiff’s accountants were\n\nworking to ascertain the net amount during the course of the trial and the result was\n\ntendered to the court, as an agreed fact after the trial. It is disturbing that the\n\nPlaintiff launched this action and proceeded to trial before such verification.97.        All said, the\n\nPlaintiff’s claims were unfounded.",
        "Conclusion": "98.        For all these reasons,\n\nthe Plaintiff’s action is dismissed with costs. I will hear parties on their\n\nsubmissions on the question of costs.Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
