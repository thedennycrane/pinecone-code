        "Introduction": "1.    The Applicant Ricky Charles s/o Gopal Thanabalan claims\n\nagainst the Respondent Chua Boon Yeow for damages for personal injury arising from an\n\naccident on 25 December 1995 in which a car driven by the Respondent collided into a\n\nmotorcycle which the Applicant was riding on.2.    On 18 July 2000, the Applicant filed an action in the\n\nDistrict Court against the Respondent. Subsequently, the Applicant obtained an\n\ninterlocutory judgment from the District Court against the Respondent, by consent, with\n\ndamages to be assessed.3.    Thereafter on 11 January 2002, the Applicant filed the\n\npresent application i.e Originating Summons No 46 of 2002/W to transfer the proceedings in\n\nthe District Court to the High Court pursuant to s 18(2) of the Supreme Court of\n\nJudicature Act (‘SCJA’) and O 89 r 2 of the Rules of Court 1999.4.    The sole ground on which the application was made was that\n\nthe damages sought by the Applicant may well exceed $250,000 i.e the limit of the civil\n\njurisdiction of the District Court in view of certain medical reports.5.    The application was initially resisted on the ground that\n\nit was unlikely that the Applicant’s damages would exceed $250,000 in view of a\n\nsurveillance of the Applicant which the Respondent had caused to be undertaken and a\n\nmedical report obtained by the Respondent. However, notwithstanding these two reports, it\n\nwas not possible for me to say, at this stage, that the Applicant’s damages would\n\nnecessarily be less than $250,000.6.    However, I had a concern. As interlocutory judgment had already\n\nbeen granted by the District Court, it seemed strange to me that there would be another\n\njudgment or order, this time from the High Court, on the same cause of action but\n\nregarding the quantum of damages.7.    Eventually, after hearing arguments, I dismissed the application\n\non 12 April 2002 with some costs to be paid to the Respondent in any event.The legislation8.    Section 18 SCJA states:‘Power of High Court18.(1) The High Court shall have such powers as are vested in itby\n\n  any written lawfor the time being in force in Singapore.(2) Without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the High\n\n  Court shall have the powers set outin the First Schedule.(3) The powers referred to in subsection (2) shall be exercised in\n\n  accordance withany written lawor Rules of Court relating to them.’[Emphasis added.]9.    Clause 10 of the First Schedule to the SCJA states:‘Transfer of proceedings10. Power to transfer any proceedings to any other court or to or from\n\n  any subordinate court, and in the case oftransferto orfrom a subordinate\n\n  courtto give any directionsas to the further conduct thereof, except that\n\n  this power shall be exercised in such manner as may be prescribed by Rules of Court.’[Emphasis added.]10.    Section 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) states:‘General power to transfer from District Court to High\n\n  Court38. Where it is made to appear to the High Court, on the application of\n\n  a party to any civil proceeding pending in a District Court, that the proceeding by reason\n\n  of its involving some important question of law, or being a test case, or for any other\n\n  sufficient reason, is one which should be tried in the High Court, it may order the record\n\n  to be transferred to the High Court.’11.    I would add that in so far as the application also relies on O 89\n\nr 2 of the Rules of Court, this provision is immaterial as it applies only where an order\n\nis made for the transfer of proceedings from the Subordinate Courts (which includes the\n\nDistrict Court) to the High Court.12.    I was of the view that Clause 10 of the First Schedule to the\n\nSCJA and s 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act should be read together. Although the High\n\nCourt has a wide power to transfer proceedings from the District Court to the High Court,\n\nunder Clause 10, the grounds for doing so should come under one of the limbs in s 38.13.    It was not suggested that the Applicant’s claim involved\n\nsome question of law or was a test case. The sole ground for his application was, as I\n\nhave said, that the damages may well exceed $250,000. This would usually constitute\n\nsufficient reason to transfer the proceedings to the High Court.14.    However, in view of the Interlocutory Judgment granted by the\n\nDistrict Court, I doubted that the High Court even had the jurisdiction to order the\n\ntransfer at this stage of the proceedings.15.    Mr Perumal Athitham, Counsel for the Applicant, cited the case of\n\nAustralian Master Builders Co Pty Ltd v Ng Tai Tuan[1988] 1 MLJ 273.16.    In that case, the plaintiffs had commenced an action in the High\n\nCourt for $65,215.25 for goods sold and delivered to the defendant. The plaintiffs\n\nobtained summary judgment for $10,848 and the defendant was ordered to furnish security\n\nfor the balance of the claim i.e $54,367.25. The plaintiffs decided to reduce the quantum\n\nof the balance of the claim to $50,000 by abandoning the excess so as to bring the balance\n\nwithin the then jurisdiction of the District Court which was $50,000. The Defendant\n\nobjected on the basis that since the plaintiffs had already obtained judgment for $10,848,\n\ntheir overall claim, including the reduced balance of $50,000 was still more than $50,000.17.    Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) found this a rather perplexed\n\nform of argument as the $10,848, having been adjudged in favour of the plaintiffs, could\n\nnot possibly be regarded as a claim. He went on to consider the then s 38 of the\n\nSubordinate Courts Act (Cap 321) which stated:‘In any action commenced by way of writ of summons in the High\n\n  Court in the exercise of its original civil jurisdiction, any party may for any sufficient\n\n  reason at any time apply to the High Court for an order that the proceedings be\n\n  transferred to a District Court, and the High Court may thereupon, if it thinks fits,\n\n  order that the proceedings be transferred accordingly notwithstanding any other provisions\n\n  of this Act.’18.    In Chan JC’s view, this section was clear. It gave ‘the\n\nHigh Court an unfettered discretion to transfer at any time any proceedings commenced by\n\nwrit of summons to the District Court. The words \"notwithstanding any other\n\nprovisions of this Act\" have the effect of vesting in the High Court the jurisdiction\n\nto increase the ordinary civil jurisdiction of the District Court’.19.    Having said that, he then went on to say that the next issue was\n\nwhether the proceedings should be transferred to the District Court and it was not\n\ndesirable to lay down specific rules as to when the court should exercise its discretion.\n\n‘Each application must be decided on its own merits’. He considered that a valid\n\nreason would be where the proceedings have come within the ordinary jurisdiction of the\n\nDistrict Court whether by a change in the law, by consent or by a party reducing his\n\nclaim. In the circumstances, he ordered a transfer to the District Court.20.    As can be seen, the facts in that case were different from those\n\nbefore me. There was no interlocutory judgment in favour of the plaintiffs there for the\n\nbalance of their claim and the application was to transfer the High Court proceedings to\n\nthe District Court with a corresponding reduction in the balance of the claim.21.    Ultimately, I still doubted whether the High Court does have the\n\npower to transfer proceedings from the District Court to the High Court if there is an\n\ninterlocutory judgment from the District Court. This is notwithstanding the words in\n\nClause 10 of the First Schedule SCJA ‘and … to give any directions as to the\n\nfurther conduct thereof …’. In my view, the limit of damages is fixed once\n\ninterlocutory judgment is entered. It will not be a question of increasing the\n\njurisdiction of the District Court since the damages will then be assessed in the High\n\nCourt. It will be a question of circumventing the limit under the interlocutory judgment\n\nof the District Court.22.    Moreover, even if the High Court has the power to transfer the\n\nproceedings notwithstanding the interlocutory judgment, it was still for the Applicant to\n\npersuade me to exercise my discretionary power in his favour.23.    Mr Perumal submitted that had the action been initiated in the\n\nHigh Court, the Respondent would have consented to an interlocutory judgment from the High\n\nCourt in any event. Hence the existence of the interlocutory judgment from the District\n\nCourt should not deny the Applicant the transfer. I did not accept such an argument. While\n\nit may well be that the Respondent would have consented to an interlocutory judgment from\n\nthe High Court, that is neither here nor there. The fact is that the interlocutory\n\njudgment was from the District Court.24.    If the assessment of damages is conducted without any transfer of\n\nthe proceedings to the High Court, the damages to be awarded will, as I have said, be\n\ncircumscribed by the jurisdiction of the District Court. The parties have proceeded on\n\nthat basis and consent interlocutory judgment was entered on that basis. I was of the view\n\nthat it was too late for the Applicant to try and overcome this by applying to transfer\n\nthe proceedings to the High Court.25.    In the circumstances, I dismissed the application.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
