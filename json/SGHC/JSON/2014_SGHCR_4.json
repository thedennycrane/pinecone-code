        "Introduction": "1       The\ngrowing sophistication of international commercial transactions has\nled to the increasing incidence of complex disputes involving multiple parties\nand multiple contracts arising from a single commercial enterprise, with\nthe traditional two-party dispute scenario fast becoming the exception rather\nthan the norm. Consequently, international arbitration, as the leading\nmode of resolving international commercial disputes, increasingly finds\nitself faced with difficult and arguably as yet unresolved issues\nrelating to joinder of third parties and consolidation of disputes. 2       It\nwas decided inThe “Titan Unity”[2013]\nSGHCR 28 (‘The “Titan Unity”’) that\nthe applicable threshold to determine theexistenceof\nan arbitration agreement in order to invoke the the court’s jurisdiction\nto grant a stay in favour of arbitration pursuant to section 6 of\nthe International Arbitration Act (Cap. 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”)\nis that of aprima faciestandard.\nAs the court was satisfied that there exists an arbitration agreement\nbetween the plaintiff, (“Portigon”) and the first defendant demise\ncharterer (“Oceanic”), the action against Oceanic was stayed in\nfavour of arbitration at the Singapore Chamber of Maritime Arbitration\n(“SCMA”). The present decision deals with the application made by\nthe second defendant shipowner (“Singapore Tankers”) to set aside\nand strike out Portigon’s action, and the question of whether this court\nshould order that Singapore Tankers be joined to the arbitration proceedings\nbetween Portigon and Oceanic.",
        "Background": "3       As\nthe background to the dispute has been set out inThe\n“Titan Unity”at [2] to [6], it would suffice for the\npurposes of the present decision to highlight the following facts. 4       Portigon\nprovided financing to a company, Onsys Energy Pte Ltd (“Onsys”)\nfor the purchase of a cargo of fuel oil by the issuance of a letter\nof credit dated 20 January 2012. As the holder of bills of lading\nwhich acknowledges the carriage of a cargo of 5,003.373 MT of fuel\noil 380CST on board the vessel (“bills of lading”), “TITAN UNITY”\n(official no. 393242) (“the vessel”), Portigon commenced a claim\nin misdelivery of cargo by filing an admiralty in rem action against\nboth defendants on 26 July 2012. 5       As\npleaded by Portigon in its statement of claim, the bills of lading contained\na clear and unequivocal representation that Singapore Tankers was\nthe contractual carrier of the cargo, because the master of the\nvessel (an employee of the manager of the vessel, Titan Ocean Pte\nLtd) had stamped the bills of lading with the stamp of Singapore\nTankers. Portigon claims that Oceanic and Singapore Tankers, both\nbeing the carriers and persons being in physical possession of the\ncargo, have failed to take reasonable care of the cargo, breached\nthe contract of carriage, and converted the cargo by having delivered\nthe cargo to third parties on 27 January 2012 without presentation\nof the bills of lading. Portigon claims the sum of US$3,687,485.90\nwhich represents the invoice value of the cargo, for the direct\nloss arising from the defendants’ breaches and/or conversion of\nthe cargo. 6       Subsequent\nto the arrest of the vessel on 24 June 2013, Singapore Tankers applied\nto set aside and strike out the admiralty writ pursuant to O 12\nr 7 and O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev\nEd) (“Rules of Court”) respectively. The application also seeks\nin the alternative for the release of the vessel pursuant to O 70\nr 12 of the Rules of Court. 7       Counsel\nfor Singapore Tankers argued that the action should be set aside\nor struck out as the claim is time-barred pursuant to Article III\nrule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules, which provides that: … the carrier and the ship shall in any\nevent be discharged from all liability whatsoever in respect of\nthe goods, unless suit is brought within one year of their delivery\nor of the date when they should have been delivered. This period\nmay, however, be extended if the parties so agree after the cause\nof action has arisen. 8       It\nwas submitted that the Hague-Visby Rules is applicable to the bills of\nlading, and sought to rely on the time bar defence by submitting\nthat nocompetent suithas been\nbrought within 12 months of the alleged mis-delivery of the cargo.\nIt was alleged that the cargo had been discharged by 2 February\n2012, so that a competent suit must be brought by 2 February 2013.\nAccording to Singapore Tankers, “suit” for the purposes of Article\nIII rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules must refer to a competent suit\nwhich was brought before the correct forum, and it was submitted\nthat the suit against Singapore Tankers was not a competent one\nas it was brought in breach of the arbitration agreement between\nPortigon and Oceanic, where Portigon’s action against Oceanic have\nbeen stayed in favour of arbitration. 9       Counsel\nfor Portigon submitted,inter alia,\nthat the time bar defence goes to the merits of the action and does\nnot constitute a jurisdictional objection. It was further submitted\nthat the Hague-Visby Rules do not in any event apply in the present\ncase as a purposive interpretation of section 3(2) of the Carriage\nof Goods by Sea Act (Cap. 33) would show that the Hague-Visby Rules\nare applicable only to shipments between ports, which is not the\nsituation in the present case. Counsel also submitted that that there\nis no indication of the date in which the alleged time bar would\nstart from because there is no evidence of the actual date in which\nthe delivery of the cargo had been completed.",
        "My decision": "",
        "Whether the writ should be set\naside": "10     Singapore\nTankers stated the ground in support of the application on the face\nof its summons as follows: The Plaintiff’s claim is time-barred pursuant\nto Article III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules because no competent\nsuit has been brought within 12 months of the alleged mis-delivery\nof the cargo. The suit is not competent as to the merits of the\nPlaintiff’s claim because it has been brought in breach of an arbitration\nagreement incorporated into the Bills of Lading sued upon. 11     Singapore\nTankers is in effect attempting to avail itself of the benefit of\nthe arbitration agreement between Portigon and Oceanic. Portigon’s action\nagainst Oceanic has been stayed in favour of arbitration, and it would\nbe up to the arbitral tribunal to decide whether the time bar under the\nHague-Visby Rules is applicable. Assumingarguendoif\nthe arbitral tribunal finds that Portigon’s claim against Oceanic\nis time barred, that finding would not bar Portigon’s claim against\nSingapore Tankers from proceedingunlessthe\ndispute between Portigon and Singapore Tankers was, just like the\ndispute between Portigon and Oceanic, part of the arbitration reference\nplaced before the arbitral tribunal.  As far as Singapore Tankers\nis concerned, even if Portigon had commenced arbitral proceedings\nagainst Oceanic and court proceedings against Singapore Tankerswithin12 months of the alleged mis-delivery\nof cargo, Singapore Tankers’ position would,  based on the ground\nas stated in its summons, still be the same, which is that the action\nbrought by Portigon against Singapore Tankers isnota\ncompetent one as it has been brought in breach of the arbitration\nagreement between Portigon and Oceanic. 12     On\nthis analysis, the true purport of the position taken by Singapore Tankers\nis that Portigon’s claim in court shouldproperlybe\nthe subject matter of the arbitral proceedings between Portigon\nand Oceanic such that the time bar under the Hague-Visby Rules applies.\nThis is at best an argument analogous to theforum\nnon conveniensscenario that the court shouldnot exercisethe jurisdictionit has, and is consequently not a jurisdictional\nobjection which warrants the admiralty writ to beset\nasideunder O 12 r 7 of the Rules of Court. It may however\nconstitute asubstantiveobjection\nto be placed for consideration under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court.\nAs Singapore Tankers admits in the ground stated in the face of\nits summons, “[t]he suit is not competentas\nto the meritsof the Plaintiff’s claim because it has\nbeen brought in breach of [the] arbitration agreement” [emphasis\nadded]. The distinction drawn by the court inThe “Bunga\nMelati 5”[2011] 2 SLR 1017 between a jurisdictional\nchallenge which properly belongs to an application brought under\nO 12 r 7, and a non-jurisdictional challenge which belongs to an\napplication under O 18 r 19, is not disputed by counsel for Singapore\nTankers. 13     There\nbeing no basis for a jurisdictional challenge under O 12 r 7, I move\non to consider the application to strike out the writ under O 18\nr 19.",
        "Whether the writ should be struck\nout": "14     As\naforementioned, the true purport of the position taken by Singapore\nTankers is that Portigon’s claim in court should properly be the subject\nmatter of the arbitral proceedings between Portigon and Oceanic such\nthat the time bar under the Hague-Visby Rules applies. Counsel for Singapore\nTankers relied upon the decision of the English Commercial Court\ninThyssen Inc v Calypso Shipping CorporationSA\n[2000] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 243 (“Thyssen”)\nin support of this position. It was submitted that the decision,\nin particular the following pronouncements of Steel J (at [22]),\nis authority for the principle that an action which has been stayed\nin favour of arbitration will not constitute a “competent suit”\nfor the purposes of Article III rule 6 of the Hague-Visby Rules: …where, as here, the [court] suit is brought\nin breach of an arbitration clause, the Courts do not regard that\nas suit for the purposes of the rule [6 of the Hague-Visby Rules]\n(unless of course there is no application for a stay). … It is not\nenough for the correct claimant to commence proceedings before a competent\nCourt against the correct defendant. The proceeding must remain valid\nand effective at the time when the carrier seeks to rely on r. 6\nin the second set of [arbitral] proceedings. Thus where the [court]\naction has been … stayed by reason of the invocation of an arbitration\nclause, [the] suit has not been brought. 15     The\ndecision however does not go very far in supporting Singapore Tankers’\nposition. The court inThyssenfound\nthat the claimant in an arbitration could not successfully prevent\nits arbitral claim from being time barred under Article III rule\n6 of the Hague-Visby Rules from the mere fact that it had commenced\ncourt proceedings against the respondent-defendant within time.\nThis was because the court action had been stayed in favour of arbitration\nwith the result that arbitration proceedings were commenced against\nthe respondent-defendant out of time. There were no pronouncements\nmade by that court that a similar claim brought within time by the\nsame plaintiff in court against a party who may be joined to the arbitral\nproceedings would as a result be rendered an “incompetent suit” and\nconsequently be struck out. 16     In\nany event, taking the case put forth by Singapore Tankers at its best,even ifthe suit brought against Singapore\nTankers is not a competent onebecauseit\nwas brought in breach of the arbitration agreement between Portigon\nand Oceanic, there is no authority submitted by Singapore Tankers\nto show why theremedyfor such\na situation would be tostrike outthe\nwrit filed in court. Surely, such a remedy is inconsistent with\nthestayingof court actions (as\nopposed to striking out) when the actions were found to have been\nbrought in breach of arbitration agreements. In fact, it is implicit in\nSingapore Tankers’ reliance onThyssenthat\nPortigon’s claim against Singapore Tankers should, just like the\nclaim against Oceanic, bestayedin favour\nof arbitration such that the time bar may be applicable, as opposed\nto it being struck out.",
        "Whether the vessel should be\nreleased": "17     Singapore\nTankers applied in the alternative for the vessel to be released.\nIt was alleged that counsel for Portigon had failed to disclose\nto the court which granted the arrest that the same law firm was\nacting for Portigon and the liquidators of Onsys. As Oceanic had\ntime sub-chartered the vessel to Onsys, it would have documents\nwhich could evidence the existence of the time charterparty which\ncontains the arbitration agreement under which the Hague-Visby time\nbar defence was applicable. It was also alleged that Portigon should\nhave disclosed the correspondence between Portigon and Onsys relating\nto the circumstances behind the misdelivery of the cargo as well\nas the vessel’s chartering arrangements. Singapore Tankers also\ntake the position that Portigon should have disclosed the fact that\nit did not request such further documents from Onsys’ liquidators. 18     To\nmy mind, the alleged non-disclosure is not relevant because it was undisputed\nthat counsel for Portigon had disclosed to the court the time bar defence\nunder the Hague-Visby Rules. The documents and correspondence exchanged\nbetween Portigon’s and Oceanic’s solicitors which set out Oceanic’s\nposition on the existence of the time charterparty and the time bar\ndefence were disclosed, and counsel for Portigon had even made submissions\nat the hearing for the arrest of the vessel on why the action should\nnot be stayed even assuming if the time charterparty did exist. Singapore\nTankers did not specify what exactly were the correspondence between\nPortigon and Onsys which were undisclosed, nor the basis in which\nsuch documents can reasonably be assumed to exist. In addition,\nthe alleged failure to disclose something which did not happen,\nor a non-event, appears to be quite an unusual ground for the application;\nit was not explained how the fact that Portigon did not request\nfurther documents from Onsys’ liquidators would amount to a material\nfact which ought to be disclosed. The documents which Portigon failed\nto request were not specified, and it was not shown that such documents\nexists in the first place. In any event, the position taken by Singapore\nTankers could no longer be maintained given its own concession that\nthere is no suggestion that the lawyers acting for Portigon would\nhave access to the documents in the hands of the Onsys’ liquidators,\neven if the lawyers acting for the latter are from the same firm\n(Magelssen’s first affidavit at paragraph [20]).",
        "Whether Singapore Tankers should\nbe joined to the arbitral proceedings between Portigon and Oceanic": "The basis for ordering a joinder 19     With\nthe striking out and setting aside application dismissed, the court\naction against Singapore Tankers subsists alongside the arbitral proceedings\nbetween Portigon and Oceanic. As Portigon makes the same claims\nbased on the same causes of action against both Oceanic and Singapore\nTankers upon on the same set of factual matrix, efficiencies could\nbe gained if the disputes are consolidated in a single adjudication setting,\nand this has the benefit of preventing inconsistent decisions. This presents\nan obvious issue of whether the court could on its own motion order\nthat Singapore Tankers be joined to the arbitral proceedings. This court\nhas on 12 November 2013 queried counsel on whether Singapore Tankers\nmay be joined as a party to the arbitration proceedings in the event where\nPortigon’s action against Oceanic is stayed in favour of arbitration. Counsel\nfor Portigon highlighted the fact that Singapore Tankers did not seek\na stay of the court action, and subsequently submitted that the\nCourt of Appeal had in the recent decision inPT\nFirst Media TBK (formerly known as PT Broadband Multimedia TBK)\nv Astro Nusantara International BV and others and another appeal[2013]\nSGCA 57 (“Astro”) emphasized that any\nnotion of forced joinder would impinge upon party autonomy and confidentiality\n(see written submissions dated 4 December 2013 at [14]). Counsel\nfor Singapore Tankers takes the position thatAstrois\nnot relevant to the present case. 20     The\nrelevant question before the Court of Appeal inAstrowas whether\nthe arbitral tribunal had correctly construed rule 24(b) of the\n2007 Singapore International Arbitration Centre Rules as a rule\nwhich parties have agreed to confer upon the tribunal the power\nto order parties who are not parties to the arbitration agreement\nto be joined to an existing arbitration reference. The Court of\nAppeal did not accept the arbitral tribunal’s construction of the\nrule (at [181] and [188]) : … A tribunal cannot extend its jurisdiction\nto disputes over which it has no jurisdiction by simply purporting\nto rely on r 24. To this extent we accept Mr Landau’s argument that\nr 24(b) acts as a procedural power, rather than a means for a tribunal\nto extend its jurisdiction. It would otherwise be a portal through\nwhich a tribunal could exercise unlimited jurisdiction over any dispute\nwhich any non-party could have with the parties to the arbitration reference.\nWe do not think that any set of arbitration rules, unless explicitly stated\notherwise (and even then, we would reserve our views), could provide for\nsuch unlimited jurisdiction. The terms of any arbitration reference\nmust ultimately lie within the limits described by the arbitration\nagreement, save to the extent that it might be extended with the\nexplicit consent of all the parties. In our judgment, the general\nposition must be that the arbitration agreement sets the parameters\nof the tribunal’s jurisdiction. … … The forced joinder of non-parties is also\na major derogation from the principle of party autonomy, which is\nof foundational importance because all arbitrations must proceedin liminefrom an agreement to arbitrate.\nForced joinders carve out a significant exception to this by compelling\nan arbitration with other persons with whom the parties had not\nspecifically agreed to arbitrate. Even where these other persons\nare connected to the subject matter of the arbitration, there has\nbeen no election of arbitration as the specific dispute resolution\nmechanism with those other persons. 21     While\nthe question of when a court may order a joinder was not placed\nbefore the Court of Appeal inAstro,\nthe judicial philosophy on according due significance to the principle\nof party autonomy would apply with no less compelling force. As\nsuch, while a court may be acutely aware of the legitimate advantages\nand procedural efficiencies which would be gained with a forced\njoinder, it should nevertheless be borne in mind that these considerations\nin and of themselves do not provide the court withthe authorityto\nderogate from the principle of party autonomy in the absence of\nany express statutory provisions to the effect. Given that the IAA\nis silent on the issue of joinder, this court is guided by the spirit\nbehind the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration\n(“Model Law”), which is given the force of law via section 3 of\nthe IAA. Section 4 of the IAA allows this court to refer to thetravaux préparatoireswhen interpreting\nthe Model Law, and it is that which I turn my attention to. The drafters\nconsidered the question of whether the Model Law should contain provisions\nrelating to joinder (Second Secretariat Note,\nPossible Features of a Model Law: Questions for Discussion, A/CN.9/WG.II/WP.35\n(1 December 1981); H. Holtzmann & J. Neuhaus,A Guide to the UNCITRAL Model Law on International\nCommercial Arbitration: Legislative History and Commentary311\n(2013) (“Holtzmann & Neuhaus”)): Should the model law deal with problems\nof consolidation in multi-party disputes (e.g. whether consolidation\nagreements should be given effect, or whether even without such\nagreements consolidation might be ordered)? 22     The\ndrafters of the Model Law considered the question and took the following\nposition (First Working Group Report A/CN.9/216\n(23 March 1982); Holtzmann & Neuhausat 312): There was general agreement that the model\nlaw should not deal with problems of consolidation in multi-party\ndisputes.While it was agreed that parties\nhad the freedom to conclude consolidation agreements if they so\nwished, the Working Group was of the view that there\nwas no real need to include a provision on consolidation in the\nmodel law. [Emphasis added] 23     To\nthe drafters, it was not necessary to provide any provisions because parties\nhad the freedom to form their own agreements if they so wished to have\na joinder (see Julian D M Lew QC, Loukas A Mistelis, Stefan M Kröll,Comparative International Commercial Arbitration(Kluwer\nLaw International, 2003), at para 16-47).  In so far as the only\npremise in which a joinder will take place under the framework envisaged\nby the drafters of the Model Law is upon the agreement of parties;consentis, in the minds of the drafters,\nanecessary conditionfor there\nto be a joinder. This must necessarily be so, for if there does\nnot exist an agreement to arbitrate, this could be a ground for\nrefusal of recognition and enforcement under Art 36(1)(a)(i) (or\nsection 31(2)(b) of the IAA and Art V(1)(a) of the 1958 Convention\non the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards (“the\nNew York Convention”)). In addition, where a person is joined without\nthe consent of the parties, the resulting arbitral award could be\nrefused recognition and enforcement for having dealt with a dispute\nnot contemplated within the terms of the submissions to arbitration,\nunder Art 36(1)(a)(iii) (or section 31(2)(d) of the IAA and Art\nV(1)(c) of the New York Convention). Where the composition of the\narbitral tribunal is not in accordance with the agreement of the\nparties, including the party joined, the award given by a tribunal\nin which that party had no say in appointing may be refused recognition\nand enforcement, under Art 36(1)(a)(iv) (or section 31(2)(e) of\nthe IAA and Art V(1)(d) of the New York Convention). 24     The\nrationale of the approach adopted by the drafters of the Model Law\nshould be self-evident. Consent is the very foundation of arbitration, without\nwhich an arbitral tribunal’s authority to hear and determine the dispute\nis non-existent. If a court orders a joinder notwithstanding the\nlack of consent, it would force a party to bring its dispute to\nbe adjudicated by a forum which has no jurisdiction to decide the\nmatter from which no enforceable award could be rendered. More fundamentally,\nthe non-consenting party would be denied its right to access the\ncourts when it has not waived its right to do so in the form of\nan arbitration agreement. As such, in adherence with the spirit\nof the Model Law and the New York Convention, a court has the power\nto order a joinder only with the parties’ consent. The exercise\nof such power is a function of the basic requirement to recognize\nand give effect to arbitration agreements entrenched in section 6\nof the IAA, Art 8 of the Model Law, and Art II(1) of the New York Convention,\nsuch that a party is joined to an arbitration pursuant to an agreement\nto arbitrate formed amongst parties (See generally Gary Born,International Arbitration: Law and Practice Vol I(Kluwer\nLaw International, 2012), p 223). This is either where: (a)     the\nparty sought to be joined is found to be a contracting party to\nthe arbitration agreement; or (b)     parties\nto the arbitration agreement have consented to extend the agreement\nto a person who was not a party to the agreement but who accepts\nto be bound by it, with such consent forming an agreement to arbitrate. 25     For\nthe latter situation, parties to the arbitration agreement may have agreed\nvia the rules of the relevant arbitral institution to the procedural mechanism\nand criteria in which the consent will be given to join a person who\nis not a party to the arbitration agreement.  In either event, consent\nis a necessary condition for a joinder, save perhaps for the unique\nsituation where parties to the arbitration agreement have unequivocally\nagreed that one or all of the parties to the arbitration agreement\nneed not consent to the joinder of persons who are not parties to\nthe arbitration agreement (see e.g., Art 4 of the Swiss Rules of\nInternational Arbitration; and even then, the extent and nature\nof the precise agreement should be carefully examined to determine\nthe true intention of the parties; seeAstroat\n[181]). The issue of joinder in the\npresent case 26     As\nSingapore Tankers has taken the position that that it isnota party to the contract of carriage\nwhich incorporates the arbitration agreement, the proper analysis\nhere would not be on how Singapore Tankers may be found to be a\ncontracting party to an arbitration agreement (these relate to situations\n concerning incorporation of the arbitration agreement; the absence\nof separate corporate personality; or agency (See William W. Park,Non-Signatories and International Contracts: An Arbitrator’s\nDilemma, inMultiple Party Actions\nin International Arbitration, Oxford 2009) (“William Park”)). 27     Instead,\nthe issue in the present case is whether the parties to the arbitration\nagreement, i.e, Portigon and Oceanic, have consented to extend the\nagreement to Singapore Tankers, and whether it accepts to be bound\nby the arbitration agreement, thus forming an agreement to arbitrate\namongst the parties. Counsel for Portigon takes the position that\nneither Portigon nor Singapore Tankers have consented to the joinder\nof Singapore Tankers to the arbitration between Portigon and Oceanic\n(see plaintiff’s written submissions dated 4 December 2013 at [16]). Determining if a person is a\nparty to an agreement to arbitrate 28     Whether\na person is a party to an agreement to arbitrate is a fact-intensive\nquestion which has to be determined in accordance with the law applicable\nto decide who are the persons mandated to have their disputes resolved\nby arbitration instead of the court process, i.e, thelex arbitriof the forum seized of the\nstay or joinder application. In this regard, both section 2A of\nthe IAA and Art II(7) of the Model law provide a broad definition\nof an arbitration agreement as an “agreement by the parties to submit\nto arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or which\nmay arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,\nwhether contractual or not”; and an arbitration agreement may be\nin the form of an arbitration clause or in a contract or in the\nform of a separate agreement, but an arbitration agreement shall\nbe in writing. Reference should also be made to Art II(1) of the\nNew York Convention, given that any joinder may have an impact on\nthe enforceability of an award in other jurisdictions. That provision\nrefers to “an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake\nto submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or\nwhich may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship, whether\ncontractual or not, concerning a subject-matter capable of settlement\nby arbitration”. 29     In\nline with the position adopted by the Court of Appeal inInternational Research Corp PLC v Lufthansa Systems\nAsia Pacific Pte Ltd and another[2014] 1 SLR 130 (“International Research Corp”), which referred\nto the approach inZurich Insurance (Singapore)\nPte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design and & Construction Pte Ltd[2008]\n3 SLR(R) 1029,  the court should have regard to the context andobjective circumstancesto ascertain the\nparties’objectiveintentions in\ndetermining the question of whether a person is a party to an agreement\nto arbitrate.  The Court of Appeal inInternational\nResearch Corpadopted this contextual approach to determine the\nquestion of whether a third person would be bound by an arbitration agreement\nfound in a contract between two parties, where the third person had\nentered into a supplemental agreement with the two original contracting\nparties.  On a contextual interpretation of the agreements, the Court\nof Appeal found that it was not the parties’ intention for the arbitration\nagreement to be incorporated as part of the supplemental agreement,\nand the third person was accordingly not bound by the arbitration\nagreement. 30     It\nwould also be useful to refer to international norms derived from cross-jurisdictional\ncases with similar factual matrix which may be instructive in determining\nwhether a person is a party to an agreement to arbitrate for the\npurposes of ordering a joinder, given the international character\nof the Model Law and New York Convention. In this regard, there are\ndecisions which illustrate the court’s willingness to determine\nfrom the parties’ conduct and objective circumstances the true intentions\nof the parties, such as the case ofSouthern\nIllinois Beverage v. Hansen Beverage Co., 2007 WL 3046273\n(S.D. Ill. 2007), which involves an arbitration agreement in a principal\ndistributorship contract for beverage distribution between the manufacturer\nand the principal distributor. There was no arbitration agreement\nin the sub-distributorship contract. The sub-distributor commenced\na court action against the manufacturer for alleged sale of goods\nto third parties in breach of its obligations under the principal distributorship\ncontract. The court found that the sub-distributor claimant could\nnot obviate arbitration given that its claims were “fundamentally rooted\nin and dependent on [the] rights and conditions” of the principal contract,\nand that it could not disavow the arbitration agreement found in the\nprincipal contract given that it had sought to benefit directly\nunder that contract. The court asserted the following principle: … in the arbitration context, a party may\nbe estopped from asserting that an arbitration clause contained\nin a particular document is inapplicable when that same party simultaneously\nclaims the direct benefit of that contract. This estoppel doctrine\nexists to prevent a litigant from unfairly receiving the benefit\nof a contract while at the same time repudiating what it believes\nto be a disadvantage in the contract, namely the contractual arbitration\nprovision. 31     Significantly,\nthe court took the position that it would be manifestly inequitable\nto permit a plaintiff to both claim that a defendant is liable for its\nfailure to perform contractual duties under an agreement containing\nan arbitration clause, and at the same time, seek to avoid arbitration\nof claims which fell clearly within the ambit of that arbitration\nclause. 32     Reference\ncan also be made to the case ofSunkist Soft\nDrinks v Sunkist Growers, 10 F.3d 753 (11th Cir. 1993).\nGeneral Cinema Corporation (“GCC”) had obtained the contractual\nright from Sunkist Growers Inc (“Sunkist”) to market and sell the\norange soda under the “Sunkist” brand name. GCC created a wholly\nowned subsidiary known as Sunkist Soft Drinks (“SSD”) to produce\nand market the soda. Sunkist and SSD entered into a license agreement\nwhich provided a detailed framework for the marketing and sale of\nthe soda, and the license agreement included an arbitration agreement.\nSSD was subsequently bought by a company, Del Monte Corporation\n(“Del Monte”). Sunkist commenced a court action against Del Monte\nfor disputes arising from the license agreement. Del Monte sought\nto compel arbitration instead by relying on the arbitration agreement,\nbut Sunkist argued that the dispute should not be arbitrated as Del\nMonte was not a party to the arbitration agreement. The court held that,\neven though Del Monte was not formally a party to the arbitration agreement,\nSunkist was estopped from avoiding arbitration given that the basis\nof Del Monte’s cause of action lies in the license agreement itself\nin which the arbitration agreement was found, and in view that SSD\nhad practically lost its independent operating status and had become\na part of Del Monte since SSD was bought. 33Fluor Daniel Intercontinental, Inc. v. General Electric\nCo., Inc, No. 98-Civ. 7181 (WHP) 1999 WL 637236 (S.D.N.Y.\n1999) is a case which involves supply and services agreements signed\nbetween two groups of companies to construct a power plant in Saudi\nArabia. Some members of each group of companies concluded agreements\nwhich contained arbitration agreements, while other members of each\ngroup had not. The claimants deliberately chose to commence court\nproceedings against the members of the defendant group of companies\nwhich omitted to conclude agreements containing the arbitration\nagreements, alleging that the agreements had been induced through\nmisrepresentations. The court ordered that the dispute be referred\nto arbitration, on the ground that the claimants was not allowed\nto “rely on the contract when it works to their advantage…but then repudiate\nthe contract and its arbitration clause when they believe it works against\nthem”. The principle in this decision is described by a commentator as\nfollows, “a signatory to an arbitration clause will be precluded\nfrom refusing to arbitrate with a non-signatory when the essence\nof the dispute is intertwined with, or derived from, the contract\ncontaining the arbitration clause” (William\nParkat para 1.49). 34     InSociété Alcatel Business Systems (ABS), Société Alcatel\nMicro Electronics (AME) et Société AGF v Amkor Technology et al,\nCass 1e civ., Mar. 27, 2007, JCP [2007] I 168, No. 11,\na Belgian company had contracted to purchase electronic chip components\nfrom an American corporation, which obtained its supplies from a\nKorean supplier. The contract between the Belgian company and the\nAmerican corporation contained an arbitration agreement. On the\nrequest of the Belgian company, the Korean supplier would provide\nsupplies to subsidiaries of the American corporation based in France\nas this arrangement was more convenient to the Belgian company.\nThe company commenced a court action against the American corporation\nand its subsidiaries based in France for damages arising from defective\nchips. TheCour de cassationheld\nthat the subsidiaries of the American corporation could rely on\nthe arbitration agreement; this was because the Belgian company\nhad, by accepting the subsidiaries into the supply arrangement,\nconferred upon them the benefit of the arbitration clause signed\nwith their parent company, and at the same time, the subsidiaries\nhave accepted to be bound by the arbitration agreement by accepting\nto partake in the supply arrangement (William Parkat\npara 1.55). 35     The\ncases above illustrate the principle that where the objective circumstances\nand parties’ conduct reveal that the parties to the arbitration agreement\nhave consented to extend the agreement to a third person who is not\na party to the agreement, and that third person has shown by its conduct\nto accept to be bound by the agreement, parties can be found to have\nimpliedly consented to form an agreement to arbitrate where this\nhas been clearly and unequivocally shown be the parties’ objective\nintention. The concept of apurelyimplied\nagreement is however anathema to the requirement for a written arbitration\nagreement prescribed in the IAA, Model Law, and the New York Convention\n(as shown in the case ofJavor v Fusion-Crete,\nInc., XXIX Y.B. Com. Arb. P 596 (2004) (Sup. Ct. Brit. Col. 2003),\nwhere an arbitral award rendered against a party found to be an “alter\nego” of a signatory to the arbitration agreement was refused enforcement\nunder Art II(2) of the New York Convention for having failed to\nsatisfy the requirement for a written arbitration agreement).  As\ncan be seen from the case decisions considered, this requirement\nnecessitates there to be at least awrittenarbitration\nagreement from which parties’ implied consent can be determined.\nIn particular, implied consent is determined from the parties’ intention\nto extend the written arbitration agreement to a non-party who accepts\nto be bound by it (see also the decision of the Swiss Federal Supreme\nCourt inX.S.A.L., Y.S.A.L. & A v. Z, SARL(16\nOctober 2003)). Parties’ objective intention\nin the present case 36     The\nfacts of the present case are analogous to those in the cases discussed\nabove. It appears that the parties in the present case haveimpliedlyconsented to have the dispute\nresolved before an arbitral tribunal. This court has inThe “Titan Unity”found that there exists\na written arbitration agreement between Portigon and Oceanic (“the\narbitration agreement”). As alluded to above at [11] and [12], Singapore\nTankers has by its own conduct accepted to be bound by the arbitration\nagreement, as it attempts to avail itself to the benefit of the\narbitration agreement as well as the time bar applicable to the\nbills of lading which incorporates the arbitration agreement. While\nPortigon had disputed the existence of the arbitration agreement\n(seeThe “Titan Unity”at [7]),\nOceanic has taken the same position as Singapore Tankers that the\narbitration agreement did indeed exist. As for Portigon, it is evident\nthat the very basis of its cause of action against Singapore Tankers\nlies in the contract in which the arbitration agreement is found.\nPortigon has by its own admission in its pleadings, always regarded\nSingapore Tankers as the contractual carrier as the bills of lading\nhad carried the stamp of Singapore Tankers. This was, as pleaded\nby Portigon, a “clear and unequivocal representation” that Singapore\nTankerswas the contractual carrierunder\nthe bills of lading (see paragraph 6 of the statement of claim filed\non 20 August 2013).  In fact, Portigon claimsin\nthe mainagainst Singapore Tankers that it was obligated to\ndeliver the cargo in accordance with the contract of carriage contained\nin the bills of lading and had breached the contract by delivering\nthe cargo without presentation of the bills of lading; the same\nclaims were made against Oceanicin the alternative(see\nparagraphs [7] to [12] of the statement of claim filed on 20 August\n2013).  Given that Portigon is claiming against Singapore Tankers\nas the contractual carrier based on the contract of carriage contained\nin the bills of lading which incorporates the arbitration agreement\nmandating that any disputes arising out of the contract be resolved\nby arbitration, it would not lie in the mouth of Portigon to say\nthat it did not consent to have its claim against Singapore Tankers\narbitrated. 37     This\nis reinforced by the fact that Portigon had gone as far as to plead that\nOceanic and Singapore Tankers are related companies controlled by one\nTsoi Tin Chu and Tsoi’s associates (see paragraph [6(f)] of the statement\nof claim filed on 20 August 2013]. Portigon submitted evidence to\nsupport this, by alleging that Tsoi is the sole director and shareholder\nof Oceanic, and that Singapore Tankers is a subsidiary of Titan\nOcean (the managers of the vessel). The sole shareholder of Titan\nOcean is, according to Portigon, a company which is owned by the\nTitan Group, where 40.9% shares of Titan Group is owned by Titan\nOil. Tsoi and his wife, it was alleged, hold 100% of the shares\nin Titan Oil. In addition, Portigon presented further evidence which\nled it to conclude that “Singapore Tankers is nothing more than\n[an] investment vehicle nestled in this web of corporate entitled\ncontrolled by Tsoi” (see pages 34 and 35 of the plaintiff’s written\nsubmissions dated 20 August 2013). Taking these allegations to their\nlogical conclusion and in view that Portigon had proceeded with\nthe same cause of action against both Singapore Tankers and Oceanic\nbased on the same contractual obligations arising from the same\ncontract in which the arbitration agreement is found, it would appear\nthat Portigon’sobjectiveintention\nis to have the claim against Singapore Tankers arbitrated just as\nit did for the claim against Oceanic. Express agreement on mechanism\nfor joinder 38     Nevertheless,\nit is not insignificant that the parties to the arbitration agreement,\nPortigon and Oceanic, have expressly agreed upon a mechanism to\njoin a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement, under\nRule 32.2 of the SCMA Rules, which reads as follows: If the parties so agree, the Tribunal shall\nalso have the power to add other parties (with their consent) to\nbe joined in the arbitration and make a single Final Award determining\nall disputes between them. 39     In\nview that the parties have expressly agreed upon a mechanism in the\narbitral rules to join a person who is not a party to the arbitration agreement,\nthe court should defer any views it has on the parties’ implied consent\nto joinder, to the arbitral tribunal’s determination of its own jurisdiction\npursuant to that mechanism. This must be so if party autonomy is\nto be respected, and this would also be consistent with the principle\nofKompetenz-Kompetenzentrenched\nin Art 16 of the Model Law, which confers upon the arbitral tribunal\nthe power to determine if it has jurisdiction to hear the claim\nbrought by Portigon against Singapore Tankers. It could be thatexpress consentis required under the\nmechanism agreed upon by parties to the arbitration agreement, in\nwhich case implied consent would in any event not be a justifiable\ncriteria for this court to order a joinder, but that would remain\na question which the arbitral tribunal has the prerogative to determine\nin its interpretation of what consent entails under Rule 32.2 of\nthe SCMA Rules. 40     It\ncould very well be that with this approach, a court would in practice seldom\norder a person to be joined to arbitral proceedings based on implied consent,\ngiven that many arbitral rules which arbitrants subscribe to provide\nmechanisms for joinder. This is especially so where the applicable arbitral\nrules provide for the requirement ofwritten\nconsentfor joinder (see e.g., 1998 London Court of International\nArbitration Rules (“LCIA rules”), Art 22.1(h)). The obvious difficulty\nwith this approach in the present case is that the arbitral tribunal\nwould have necessarily been appointed without the say of Singapore\nTankers by the time in which a decision has been made by the tribunal\non whether it should be joined to the arbitration. As alluded to at\n[23] above, this may have an effect on the enforceability of the\naward rendered. The concern is illustrated in the decision ofSiemens AG and BKMI Industrieanlagen GmbH v Dutco\nConstruction Co., 119 J.D.I. (Clunet) 707 (French Cour\nde cassation civ lre)(1992), where the FrenchCour\nde cassationset aside an award rendered by an arbitral\ntribunal which was constituted without the agreement of the respondents. 41     The\ndifficulty highlighted is however not an intractable one. The right of\nan arbitrant to appoint its own arbitrator has been questioned (see\ne.g., Professor Jan Paulsson,Moral Hazard\nin International Dispute Resolution, TDM 2 (2011)) and\nhas certainly been watered down in practice given the arbitrants’\nsubscription to innovative rules of arbitral institutions, such\nas those which allow an arbitrant to consent to waive its right\nto appoint an arbitrator under prescribed circumstances (see Art\n2.3 and 11.2 of the LCIA Rules). Where there is a single claimant\nbut multiple respondents, there are rules which prescribe that the\nrespondents shall jointly nominate an arbitrator, with the arbitrator\nbeing appointed by the arbitral institution if the respondents fail\nto do so (see International Chamber of Commerce Rules of Arbitration\n2012, Art 12(6)). There are even rules which allow all parties to\nthe arbitration to consent to waive their right to appoint an arbitral\ntribunal when a person is joined to an arbitration, such that the arbitral\ntribunal shall be appointed by the arbitral institution instead,\nand those which confer upon the arbitral institution the power to\nrevoke the appointment of any arbitrators upon the addition of a\nparty with the replacement tribunal appointed by the institution\n(see Hong Kong International Arbitration Centre Administered Arbitration\nRules 2013, Art 27.11). In the present case, it could be that the\nperson to be joined would be deemed to have agreed to the composition\nof the tribunal from the fact that it wishes to be joined notwithstanding\nthe fact that an arbitral tribunal has already been appointed, but\nthat is a question to be agreed amongst the arbitrants with the\npossible assistance of the arbitral tribunal and institution in\nthe construction and administration of the SCMA Rules. It should ultimately\nbe borne in mind that Art V(1)(d) of the New York Convention does\nnot prescribe that the tribunal must be appointed by the arbitrants,\nbut only that the composition of the arbitral tribunal be made in\naccordance with the agreement of the parties; and as modernised\narbitral rules have more than capably shown, an arbitrant mayagreeto a tribunal’s composition without\nhaving appointed it.",
        "Conclusion": "42     For\nthe reasons provided above, the application to set aside and to strike\nout the writ is dismissed with costs. Parties will be heard on costs.\nI will give time for parties to consider whether they would like\nto have a joint discussion with a view to add Singapore Tankers\nas a party to the arbitral proceedings, as well as for Singapore\nTankers to consider whether it wishes to be joined to the arbitral\nproceedings and if so, what necessary recourse it ought to seek\nbefore arbitral tribunal. For these purposes, it would be good if\ncounsel for parties have in mind the procedural efficiencies that\nmay be gained with a joinder and the potential costs consequences\nthat may result with concurrent court and arbitral proceedings without\na joinder. Consequently, the time for Singapore Tankers to file\nand serve its defence is extended to 4 March 2014. Parties are to\nattend a pre-trial conference on a date to be fixed to update the\ncourt on the positions taken by parties."
