        "Facts": "2        Madu was a Customer\n\nServices Officer (\"CSO\") with the Singapore Airport Terminal Services Ltd\n\n(\"SATS\"). Conleth was a former CSO and colleague of Madu, but had resigned in\n\n1997. Part of a CSO’s duties were to process boarding passes for passengers in\n\ntransit.3        Sometime in late October\n\n2000, Madu had approached Conleth for help in smuggling people overseas. Madu promised him\n\na sum of $4,500 for his help. Conleth agreed as he was in need of money to settle his\n\ncredit card bills.4        On 1 November 2000, Conleth\n\nand Madu took a flight to Bangkok. On the flight, Madu gave him some details. Conleth was\n\ntold that they would be helping to smuggle two people into the USA who did not have valid\n\ndocuments, and that all four of them would be on the same flight. However, both Madu and\n\nConleth would disembark at Hong Kong, where there was a transit stop, from where they\n\nwould later return to Singapore.5        According to the\n\nprosecution, the scheme for smuggling people into the USA was that in return for money\n\npaid to him by one Khan, Madu would churn out two fake boarding passes in his and\n\nConleth’s name. They would then use these passes to board a flight to the USA on\n\nwhich they were not listed as passengers. The persons smuggled would be on the same\n\nflight. Madu and Conleth would then disembark at a transit point and return to Singapore\n\nwhilst the two persons smuggled would continue to the USA. However, the details of this\n\nvague scheme were not disclosed to Conleth, save for what was listed in the preceding\n\nparagraph.6        On 2 November 2000, they\n\nreturned to Singapore from Bangkok on a night flight. At Changi Airport, Madu told Conleth\n\nnot to check out but to stay within the transit area in Terminal 1. He was to wait for\n\nfurther instructions and he eventually stayed overnight in the transit area.7        According to Madu, he was\n\nhanded two boarding passes by Khan on that day, which were in the names of the persons to\n\nbe smuggled. Since he and Conleth were not listed on the flight, Madu then procured two\n\nblank boarding passes, to which he had access as a SATS employee, and wrote their names on\n\nthe passes for the flight from Singapore to Hong Kong only. His actions here constituted\n\nthe s 6(a) PCA offence. All this was done in the absence of Conleth.8        Madu and Conleth then\n\nentered the holding area. To enter, both Madu and Conleth presented the bogus passes along\n\nwith their passports so that the documents would tally when checked. Madu then took the\n\nbogus pass back from Conleth. For the second check before entering the holding area\n\nproper, Madu then used the two boarding passes which he had gotten from Khan – this\n\nwas necessary since the check here was done against the passenger manifest for the flight.\n\nConleth had entered in front of Madu and did not see this. The two of them then boarded\n\nthe flight.9        As planned, both of them\n\ndisembarked in Hong Kong and waited for a day before returning on 5 November 2000. Madu\n\nlater paid Conleth $4,500 as promised. Madu was subsequently charged and convicted on five\n\ncounts of an offence under s 6(a) PCA. He also pleaded guilty to a charge under the\n\nComputer Misuse Act, Cap 50. He was sentenced to ten years imprisonment in total.",
        "The decision below": "10        The district judge found\n\nthat the only issue in dispute was themens reaof Conleth. She held that the\n\noffence of corruption in this case by Madu involved him accepting gratification in return\n\nfor churning out fake boarding passes. She held that Conleth must be shown to have had\n\nknowledge of the corrupt element, constituted by Madu’s acts, in order to be guilty\n\nof the offence charged.11        The district judge\n\nbelieved Conleth’s defence that he had had no knowledge at all of Madu’s forgery\n\nof the boarding passes. She found that Conleth’s intention was solely to aid Madu in\n\nsmuggling people to the USA. In view of the surrounding circumstances at the time, she\n\nfound that it was reasonable for Conleth not to have inquired further as to the details of\n\nthe scheme. The district judge also held that there was no reason for Conleth to suspect\n\nthat there was anything amiss with the boarding passes. Since the offence of abetment by\n\nintentional aid required knowledge of the circumstances constituting the offence abetted,\n\nshe found that the prosecution had not satisfied its burden of proof concerning\n\nConleth’smens reaon the evidence adduced. She accordingly acquitted Conleth.",
        "The appeal": "12        The only issue in this\n\nappeal was whether the judge below had erred in finding that Colneth had not been proven\n\nto have possessed themens reafor the offence.13        The relevant parts of s\n\n6(a) and s 29(a) PCA read:6(a)    If any agent corruptly accepts or\n\n    obtains, … from any person, for himself or for any other person, any gratification as\n\n    an inducement or reward for doing or forbearing to do, or for having done or forborne to\n\n    do, any act in relation to his principal’s affairs or business, or for showing or\n\n    forbearing to show favour or disfavour to any person in relation to his principal’s\n\n    affairs or business; …he shall be guilty of an an offence…29(a)    Whoever abets, within the meaning of the Penal\n\n    Code the commission of an offence under this Act; … shall be deemed to have committed\n\n    the offence and shall be liable on conviction to be punished with the punishment provided\n\n    for that offence.Further, s 107(c) of the Penal Code, Cap 224 provides:A person abets the doing of a thing who intentionally\n\n    aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.14        The DPP pointed to the\n\nevidence that had been adduced against Conleth and argued that it was an irresistible\n\ninference that Conleth must have known of Madu’s actions, or, at the very least, have\n\nhad knowledge that something was amiss with the boarding passes. It was argued that this\n\nwould have been sufficient to found themens reafor the offence.15        A list of the evidence\n\nagainst Conleth was set out by the DPP:(i) He knew that Madu was a CSO and, being a former CSO, knew that\n\n    Madu’s duties involved dealing with passengers checking in;(ii) he would further know that a CSO was able to generate boarding\n\n    passes at will;(iii) the district judge had found that he knew Madu would be paid for\n\n    the scheme, and Conleth himself was paid a large sum of money;(iv) the circumstances prior to the trip were suspicious – Conleth\n\n    had to wait in the transit area overnight and fly off immediately the next day, which\n\n    meant he never went through immigration, a fact he would have realised;(v) although he did not buy tickets nor checked in, Madu was able to\n\n    appear with his boarding pass;(vi) he knew that he was to help in smuggling people illegally; and(vii) he had seen the forged boarding pass with his name hand-written\n\n    on it16        I must confess at the\n\noutset that I was unable to see how the scheme as disclosed could have effectively\n\nsmuggled people into the USA. This was also a mystery to all the parties involved, and the\n\ndetails adduced at the trial below did not shed much light on the matter.17        Furthermore, it was\n\nunhelpful to focus on the fact that Conleth knew, or thought, that he was helping to\n\nsmuggle people into the USA by his actions. Involvement in the scheme itself did not give\n\nrise to criminal liability; what should be focused on was the extent of his awareness of\n\nMadu’s actions. His knowledge that he was involved was neither here nor there; for\n\nall intents and purposes, all he had actually done here was to accept money in return for\n\naccompanying a friend to board a plane to Hong Kong.18        Turning to the question of\n\nwhether the judge below had erred in her finding that Conleth had had no knowledge of\n\nMadu’s actions, I found the burden on the DPP in this instance to be a heavy one. In\n\nthe proceedings below, the district judge had made her finding not just on the basis of\n\nthe evidence before her, but also because she hadbelievedboth Madu’s and\n\nConleth’s evidence that Conleth had had no knowledge of Madu’s actions. While\n\nnot explicitly stated in her grounds of decision, her decision on Conleth’s\n\ncredibility must have stemmed in part from her observation of his demeanour, since there\n\nwas no other objective evidence in support of his story. As held inAng Jwee Herng v PP[2001] 2 SLR 474, an appellate court will be slow to overturn findings of fact by the\n\ntrial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the witnesses\n\nhas been made.19        Having examined the\n\nevidence carefully, I found it could not be proven beyond reasonable doubt that Conleth\n\neither knew or should have suspected both that there was something improper about the\n\nboarding passes and that Madu had brought this about with his powers as a CSO.20        As the district judge had\n\nfound, Conleth had had no details of the scheme save what Madu had told him. Notably,\n\nnothing was mentioned about the boarding passes. The scheme to smuggle was so murky that\n\nit cannot be said with certainty that Conleth must have known or suspected that Madu had\n\nto breach his duties by preparing false boarding passes as part of the scheme.21        Similarly, the fact that\n\nConleth had to spend the night in the transit area did not lend weight to the inferences\n\nwhich this court was urged to draw. It was also in evidence that Madu had taken\n\nConleth’s passport and told him that he would \"settle everything\" with\n\nregards to the flight to the USA; in such circumstances, it was not at all improbable for\n\nConleth to think that Madu had legitimately bought tickets and checked in on the flight\n\nfor both of them.22        The strongest piece of\n\nevidence for the prosecution was the fact that Conleth had seen the boarding pass with his\n\nname hand-written on it. However, there was no evidence as to whether a boarding pass with\n\na passenger name hand-written on it would be considered unusual or wrong. It was entirely\n\npossible that, because Conleth used to be a CSO, what would strike other people as odd\n\nabout the boarding pass would in fact seem normal to him. In addition, it must be noted\n\nthat Conleth was able to pass through the security check using the fake said boarding pass\n\nwithout any problems.23        In contrast, the district\n\njudge found Conleth’s defence believable since it was entirely logical for him not to\n\nhave known much about the scheme, save that generally it was to smuggle people into the\n\nUSA. There was no reason to think, on the evidence, that Conleth would have had knowledge\n\nof Madu’s corrupt activities.24        In view of the above, I\n\nwas of the opinion that while Conleth’s conduct in this matter was thoroughly\n\ndishonest and reprehensible, the fact remained that he had not been proven to have\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under our laws. Moral culpability by itself is not a\n\nsufficient basis to found criminal liability.",
        "Conclusion": "25        For the above reasons, I\n\ndismissed the appeal against acquittal."
