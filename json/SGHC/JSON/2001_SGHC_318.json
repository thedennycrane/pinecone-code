        "Interlocutory stage": "3\n\n        It is necessary to set out the manner in which\n\nthis action has progressed at the interlocutory stage, at least in respect of the material\n\nevents. The Plaintiffs filed the writ along with their joint statement of claim on 17\n\nNovember 2000. On the same day they applied for and obtained an interim injunction to\n\nforbid the Defendants from transferring or otherwise disposing of the Trade Marks until\n\nafter the trial of the action.4\n\n        On 12 December 2000, in SIC 1447/2000 WTC\n\napplied for the action to be stayed or dismissed on the ground offorum non conveniens,\n\nalternatively that it was an abuse of the process of the court. WTC’s ground was that\n\nMalaysia was the proper and more convenient forum for the resolution of this dispute. Also\n\nhe alleged that the Plaintiffs had commenced a similar action in Malaysia which had been\n\ndismissed on 25 October 2000 for want of prosecution. The Plaintiffs had not appealed\n\nagainst that order and the present action was therefore an abuse of the process of the\n\ncourt.5\n\n        WTC’s application was heard by Selvam J.\n\nOn 15 March the judge dismissed it with costs and ordered the Defendants to file their\n\nDefence within 3 weeks. On 30 March 2001, WTC filed an application to stay proceedings\n\npending an appeal (which was yet to be filed) against that order. However the stay\n\napplication was dismissed on 20 April, and WTC withdrew his appeal against the order of\n\nSelvam J shortly thereafter.6\n\n        Meanwhile discovery and other applications were\n\nproceeded with. There were 2 subsequent amendments to the statement of claim, on 21\n\nNovember 2000 and 5 March 2001. In the event WTC and Forward Supreme filed their separate\n\ndefences on 5 April 2001.7\n\n        On 20 August 2001 the Defendants applied to\n\nvacate the trial dates fixed for 3-21 September 2001 on four grounds:(i)    that the Plaintiffs had taken out\n\n  committal proceedings against WTC in respect of an alleged breach of certain undertakings\n\n  he had given to the court in proceedings related to the present action;(ii)    that one of the directors of\n\n  Forward Supreme, a material witness for the Defendants, was due to give birth during the\n\n  period fixed for the trial;(iii)    that the Plaintiffs had given late\n\n  discovery of some documents and were proposing to call additional witnesses; and(iv)    that the Defendants wished to call\n\n  an expert witness on the valuation of the Trade Marks.It appears that this application was heard\n\nby the Registrar on 22 August. He re-fixed the trial dates to 5-21 September. The\n\nDefendants immediately lodged an urgent appeal. This was heard that very afternoon by Lai\n\nSiu Chiu J. She dismissed it after securing an undertaking from the Plaintiffs that they\n\nwould not proceed with the committal proceedings until after the trial.8\n\n        The affidavits of evidence-in-chief were\n\nexchanged on 31 August 2001.",
        "The amendment application": "9\n\n        The Plaintiffs’ case is that although the\n\nTrade Marks were registered in WTC’s name, he had held them as trustee for them.\n\nThere are various grounds upon which the Plaintiffs base this assertion, but it is not\n\nnecessary for me to go into the details. WTC’s defence is that the Trade Marks\n\nbelonged to him beneficially and he had never held them on trust for either Plaintiff. He\n\ncontended that the Plaintiffs, who had been using those Trade Marks in Malaysia, did so\n\nunder a licence granted by him. I should state that this description gives only the bare\n\nessentials of the pleadings. There had been a tussle between WTC and his brother, Whang\n\nTar Liang (\"WTL\") in relation to the Singapore holding company of the\n\nPlaintiffs, Lam Soon Cannery Pte Ltd (\"LSC\"). In CWU 321/1999, WTL had\n\npetitioned to wind up LSC which was mostly owned by WTC and WTL and their nominees. The\n\nparties eventually settled the matter after protracted negotiations. However they disagree\n\nas to one of the terms of that settlement which concerns the Trade Marks. Therefore a\n\nlarge part of statement of claim and the defence of WTC dealt with those negotiations. But\n\nI need not go into the details here save to say that the statement of claim ran into 18\n\npages with 23 paragraphs while the defence of WTC ran into 29 pages with 64 paragraphs.10\n\n        The trial started at 10:00 am on 5 September\n\n2001. Just before that on the same morning, WTC’s solicitors filed this application\n\nfor leave to amend the defence. The application was placed before me to be dealt with\n\nbefore commencement of the trial. Naturally WTC’s solicitors had not yet managed to\n\nserve the SIC on the Plaintiffs’ solicitors. Mr Davinder did not object to this but\n\nasked for the trial to be stood down to take instructions from his clients. I adjourned\n\nthe hearing to 11:00 am. When it resumed, Mr Davinder requested further time to consider\n\nthe application, in particular in respect of the law. However he was prepared to proceed\n\nwith the Plaintiffs’ opening statement and work on his submissions for this\n\napplication overnight. This would enable the court hearing time to be fully utilised. In\n\nthe event the trial commenced, but at Mr Tan’s insistence, without prejudice to\n\nWTC’s position that the application was made before the start of the trial.11\n\n        The hearing of this application continued on 6\n\nSeptember. At the end of it, I granted Mr Tan’s application to file an affidavit in\n\nsupport of 2 paragraphs of the proposed amendments. This was done on 7 September with the\n\nfiling of an affidavit by WTC’s son, Whang Sun Tze (\"WST\").12\n\n        WTC’s application was for leave to amend\n\nhis defence by adding 4 paragraphs. Mr Tan characterised them as follows:(a)    Paragraph 47, to\n\n  plead that even if there was an implied contract, the Plaintiffs are out of time by\n\n  operation of s.6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act. As I had allowed this amendment, it is\n\n  therefore not the subject of the appeal and I need not deal with it.(b) Paragraph 57, to plead that even if\n\n  WTC had held the Trade Marks on trust, by his refusal to execute a Deed of Assignment in\n\n  1987, he was in breach of trust at the time. Therefore the cause of action ran from that\n\n  date, and is now time barred pursuant to section 22(2) of the Limitation Act, if it were a\n\n  constructive remedial trust.(c) Paragraph 58, to plead, in case\n\n  s.21(1)(b) of the Limitation Act is applicable, the defence of laches.(d) Paragraph 59, to pleadres judicatain that the issues of time bar and laches have been conclusively determined in the\n\n  Malaysian proceedings. However on 7 September Mr Tan withdrew the application in respect\n\n  of this paragraph and again, I need not deal with it.13\n\n        I set out below the additional paragraphs 47,\n\n57 and 58 that WTC applied to add to his Defence:47. Further and/or in the alternative,\n\n  with respect to paragraph 10 read with paragraphs 12 and 14 of the Re-amended Statement of\n\n  Claim, to the extent that the Plaintiffs allege an implied contract existed between the\n\n  2nd Plaintiffs and the 1st Defendant, which in any event is denied, any cause of action\n\n  therefrom would have accrued by February/March 1987 when the 1st Defendant did not accede\n\n  to the requests to execute the Deed of Assignment assigning the Trademarks to the 2nd\n\n  Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant contends that the Plaintiffs are time barred pursuant to\n\n  Section 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163)Particularsa. In 1986, WTL executed a Deed of\n\n    Assignment purporting to assign to the 2nd Plaintiffs Trademarks registered in the name of\n\n    the 1st Defendant. The 2nd Plaintiffs’ application to register the said Trademarks in\n\n    the Malaysian Trade Marks Registry was rejected on the basis that the Trademarks were\n\n    registered in the name of the 1st Defendant.b. By way of a letter dated 23 December\n\n    1986 from Adnan Sundra & Low to the 2nd Plaintiffs, the 2nd Plaintiffs were informed\n\n    by their then solicitors that the application to register the Trademarks in their name was\n\n    rejected because the Trademarks were registered in the name of the 1st Defendant.c. Adnan Sundra & Low apparently\n\n    prepared a fresh Deed of Assignment to be executed by the 1st Defendants. The fresh Deed\n\n    of Assignment was apparently forwarded to the 2nd Plaintiffs together with Adnan Sundra\n\n    & Low’s letter of 23 December 1986.d. In a memo dated 3 March 1987 from\n\n    Vivian Thian to Tan Kit Heng, Vivian Thian informed Tan Kit Heng that the fresh Deed of\n\n    Assignment was forwarded to the 1st Defendant in January 1987 and the 1st Defendant was\n\n    requested to execute the Deed of Assignment. The 1st Defendant however did not accede to\n\n    the request to execute the Deed of Assignment.57 Further and/or in the alternative, with\n\n  respect to paragraphs 11, 15, 16, and/or 17 of the Re-amended Statement of Claim, to the\n\n  extent that the Plaintiffs alleged that the 1st Defendant is in breach of trust, which is\n\n  in any event denied, any cause of action therefrom would have accrued by February/March\n\n  1987 when the 1st Defendant did not accede to the request to execute the Deed of\n\n  Assignment assigning the Trademarks to the 2nd Plaintiff. The 1st Defendant contends that\n\n  the Plaintiffs are time barred pursuant to Section 22(2) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163).Particularsa. The 1st Defendant repeats the\n\n    particulars enumerated at paragraph h 47 herein.58 Further and/or in the alternative,\n\n  despite the Plaintiffs being fully aware of the facts relied on in paragraphs 10 to 17 of\n\n  the Re-amended Statement of Claim, and being fully aware that by February/March 1987 the\n\n  1st Defendant did not accede to the Plaintiffs' requests to execute a Deed of Assignment\n\n  assigning the Trademarks registered in his name to the 2nd Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs are\n\n  nevertheless guilty of prolonged, inordinate and inexcusable delay in prosecuting their\n\n  claim and seeking the relief claimed herein and the Plaintiffs acquiesced in the matters\n\n  complained of, and/or by their conduct rendered it inequitable for the Plaintiffs to\n\n  commence this action and/or caused prejudice to the 1st Defendant. In the premises, the\n\n  Plaintiffs are barred by laches from claiming the alleged or any relief/reliefs against\n\n  the 1st Defendant and/or it is inequitable and unjust to grant the Plaintiffs the alleged\n\n  or any relief/reliefs.Particularsa The 1st Defendant repeats the\n\n    particulars enumerated in paragraph 47 herein.b By February/March 1987, the Plaintiffs\n\n    were well aware that the 1st Defendant did not accede to the Plaintiffs' request to\n\n    execute the Deed of Assignment.c Notwithstanding the above, the\n\n    Plaintiffs did not take any steps to assert their alleged beneficial interest in the\n\n    Trademarks, until September 1999 when the 2nd Plaintiffs commenced the Malaysian Action\n\n    which was struck off for want of prosecution on 25 October 2000.d The 1st Defendant is presently 80 years\n\n    of age. The facts averred to in paragraphs 10 to 17 of the Re-amended Statement of Claim\n\n    occurred 17 years ago. Due to the long lapse in time, the 1st Defendant's memory of the\n\n    events surrounding those events would have significantly deteriorated. It would thus be\n\n    prejudicial for the 1st Defendant to now defend himself against allegations of events that\n\n    occurred so long ago when there are no good reasons why the Plaintiffs did not assert any\n\n    alleged rights at an earlier time.14\n\n        In his supporting affidavit, WST explained that\n\nthe reason for the late application was principally due to the fact that the Defendants\n\nhad changed solicitors in July 2001, and to the pandemonium caused by WTL’s parallel\n\ncommittal application against WTC. In respect of the change of solicitors, WST said this\n\nat paragraph 3 of his affidavit:In July 2001, my father and Forward\n\n  Supreme were considering changing lawyers in the instant suit. In particular, Chong Boon\n\n  Leong the partner in charge of the instant suit was likely to become a witness …However Mr Davinder pointed out that while\n\nit may be true that the change of solicitors was effected sometime in late July (notice of\n\nchange of solicitors was filed on 3 September 2001), WST had studiously avoided saying\n\nwhen Mr Chong had advised him of the need to change solicitors. Mr Davinder said that as\n\nearly as 1 March 2001, at the hearing before Selvam J onforum non conveniens, the\n\nPlaintiffs had argued that one reason that Singapore was the more appropriate forum was\n\nbecause lawyers from Messrs Rajah & Tann (Mr Chong’s firm) would have to give\n\nevidence in this suit. By that March 2001 at the latest, WTC should have been advised of\n\nthis.15\n\n        WST also deposed that after the parties\n\nexchanged affidavits evidence-in-chief on 31 August 2001, they discovered that one of the\n\nPlaintiffs’ witnesses, Thian Yew Fong (\"Thian\") had deposed that on several\n\noccasions in 1987 she had requested WTC to sign an assignment in respect of the Trade\n\nMarks but he had refused to do so. WST said that this was consistent with WTC’s\n\naffidavit evidence-in-chief where he said that he did not recall being approached to\n\ntransfer the Trade Marks and in any event would not have agreed to it. WST said that on 3\n\nSeptember his counsel told him that he was considering amending WTC’s defence along\n\nthe lines of the present application. To this Mr Davinder said that in CWU 321/1999 which\n\nwas taken out as far back as 1999, WTL had deposed that WTC had consistently failed,\n\nrefused or neglected to transfer the Trade Marks despite his requests. Therefore\n\nWTC’s solicitors ought to have taken up this point at the outset.16\n\n        More telling is the following fact. In October\n\n1999 LSMB commenced an an action in the Kuala Lumpur High Court against WTC, LSC and LSOS\n\nin respect of the Trade Marks. At the time LSC was controlled by WTC and parties aligned\n\nwith him. WTC’s defence in that suit was filed in January 2000. It contains the\n\nfollowing paragraphs (WTC being the 1stDefendant and LSC being the 2ndDefendant):27. Further or in the alternative the 1st\n\n  Defendant will contend that the Plaintiff’s alleged cause or causes of action herein\n\n  did not arise within the time limited under the Limitations Act 1953 and is therefore\n\n  barred.28. Further or in the alternative the 1st\n\n  Defendant will contend that although the Plaintiff was at all material times fully aware\n\n  of the facts relied on in the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff was nevertheless guilty of\n\n  prolonged, inordinate and inexcusable delay in bringing this action and seeking the relief\n\n  claimed herein and the Plaintiff thereby cause or permitted the 1st Defendant to believe\n\n  as in fact the 2ndDefendant[sic]did believe that the Plaintiff did\n\n  not intend to make the claim herein or any claim against the 1st Defendant and the 1st\n\n  Defendant has thereby been prejudiced.28.1 By reason of the matters aforesaid\n\n  the Plaintiff by its conduct waived its right (if any which is denied) to claim the\n\n  alleged or any relief against the 1st Defendant and it is inequitable and unjust to grant\n\n  the Plaintiff the alleged or any relief.29. Further or in the alternative the 1st\n\n  Defendant contend that by reason of the matters aforesaid and in the circumstances the\n\n  Plaintiff is estopped from seeking any of the alleged remedies or relief sought herein.17\n\n        Similar paragraphs appear in the defence filed\n\nby LSC. Furthermore, in an affidavit filed in February 2000 to oppose LSMB’s\n\napplication for injunction in the Kuala Lumpur suit, WTC had raised issues of laches and\n\ntime bar. WTC was clearly aware of the issues of limitation and laches as far back as\n\nJanuary 2000. It was his deliberate choice in the present proceedings not to proceed on\n\nthose grounds until the start of trial. There is also evidence to suggest that his\n\nprevious solicitors also knew, independently of WTC, that those defences had been pleaded\n\nin the Kuala Lumpur suit. In CWU 321/1999, Fong Kok Keong, a director of one of the\n\nrespondents, T C Whang & Company Pte Ltd, deposed an affidavit on 24 January 2000 in\n\nwhich he exhibited the defence of LSC in the Kuala Lumpur suit. And the solicitors acting\n\nfor that respondent are none other than Messrs Rajah & Tann. Therefore WTC’s\n\nsolicitors must have been aware at a much earlier stage that such matters had been raised\n\nin the Malaysian suit.18\n\n        Mr Davinder opposed the application on two\n\ngrounds:(i) The proposed amendments do not\n\n  disclose good defences. In respect of the proposed paragraph 57, there was no evidence of\n\n  refusal in 1987. In any event, in the case of breach of trust, there is a continuing duty\n\n  to perform. The right to sue arising from the 1987 breach may be time barred, but a\n\n  beneficiary has a continuing right to demand the trustee to act in accordance with the\n\n  trust. Mr Davinder said that he was instructed that if WTC had pleaded this at the outset,\n\n  the Plaintiffs would have pleaded fraud so as to avail themselves of s.21(1)(a). He\n\n  informed the court that his instructions were that his clients had actually instructed\n\n  their instructing solicitor to plead fraud but the latter had advised that in view of the\n\n  strength of the other evidence and the difficulties with fraud, they should not do so.\n\n  However his clients have since instructed that if WTC raises question of section 22, then\n\n  they would apply to amend SOC to plead fraud.(ii) The amendments will prejudice the\n\n  Plaintiffs. The parties had proceeded on the assumption that, in respect of the issue of\n\n  repudiation, what had transpired before 15 September 2000 was irrelevant. If the\n\n  amendments were allowed, new evidence as to events in 1984 and 1987 would have to be\n\n  adduced and instructions would have to be taken on conversations in 1990 between WTL and\n\n  WTC. Furthermore, additional evidence would be needed as to why the defence of laches was\n\n  not available.19\n\n        The primary basis for my decision is the need\n\nto ensure a fair trial of the action. The following factors are material to that decision:(1) As a general rule, a party is allowed\n\n  to make any amendment to his pleadings that is reasonably necessary for the due\n\n  presentation of his case on costs provided there has been no undue delay on his part and\n\n  no prejudice to the vested right of the other party – see White Book paragraph\n\n  20/0/2. This is to enable consideration of the real questions in controversy between the\n\n  parties;(2) However this must be balanced against\n\n  the need to ensure that the trial proceeds without undue delay. The present policy of the\n\n  courts is to ensure that actions are brought to trial and disposed of speedily, subject to\n\n  justice being done to the parties. In the present case to allow the amendments would not\n\n  only have meant that the present trial dates, 13 hearing days, would have to be vacated,\n\n  but also a prolonged interlocutory process as the Plaintiffs would be pleading fraud. In\n\n  the particular the circumstances of this case, with the protagonists WTC and WTL in such\n\n  advanced age, further delays could very well prejudice the fair trial of the matter.\n\n  Indeed, WTC himself had said that he was 80 years of age and his memory had significantly\n\n  deteriorated.(3)\"There is a clear difference\n\n  between allowing amendments to clarify the issues in dispute and those that permit a\n\n  distinct defence to be raised for the first time\"– per Lord Griffiths inKetteman\n\n  v Hansel Properties[1987] AC 189 at p.220. Although inKetteman’s case,\n\n  the application to amend was made at the end of the trial, nevertheless the point remains\n\n  that the impact of these two types of amendments are quite different and would therefore\n\n  be treated differently.(4) The issues of time bar and laches had\n\n  been pleaded by WTC in the Kuala Lumpur suit and he had even filed an affidavit there\n\n  alleging those matters. He chose to sit on his hands and made no such allegations in the\n\n  present action until the first day of trial. I have no doubt that there was undue delay on\n\n  the part of WTC. WST seems to suggest that the omission was caused by his previous\n\n  solicitors. If this is alleged I need only to cite from the speech of Lord Griffiths inKetteman’s\n\n  case, at pp.219-220:… if a defence of limitation is not\n\n    pleaded because the defendant’s lawyers have overlooked the defence the defendant\n\n    should ordinarily expect to bear the consequences of that carelessness and look to his\n\n    lawyers for compensation if he is so minded.…Another factor that a judge must weigh in\n\n    the balance is the pressure on the courts caused by the great increase in litigation and\n\n    the consequent necessity that, in the interests of the whole community, legal business\n\n    should be conducted efficiently. We can no longer afford to show the same indulgence\n\n    towards negligent conduct of litigation as was perhaps possible in a more leisured age.\n\n    There will be cases in which justice will be better served by allowing the consequences of\n\n    the negligence of the lawyers to fall upon their own heads rather than by allowing an\n\n    amendment at a very late stage of the proceedings.(5) Delay in the disposition of this suit\n\n  would cause prejudice to Plaintiffs in that there is uncertainty as to whether they should\n\n  continue to develop the Trade Marks further.20\n\n        In view of the factors enumerated above, in\n\nparticular the fact that WTC had pleaded the same matters in January 2000 in the Kuala\n\nLumpur suit, the prolongation of the trial that would be caused if the amendments were\n\nallowed and the prejudice that would be caused in view of the advanced ages of the\n\nprotagonists, I was of the view that the application should be refused in respect of\n\nproposed paragraphs 57 and 58. On the question of costs, in view of the extensive\n\narguments made, and particularly the fact that the Plaintiff’s solicitors had to work\n\nurgently to prepare their submissions while the trial proceeded without substantial pause,\n\nI ordered costs to be paid by WTC to the Plaintiffs (in one set) as follows:(a) Costs of application fixed at $30,000;\n\n  and(b) Costs occasioned by the amendment to\n\n  be taxed.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
