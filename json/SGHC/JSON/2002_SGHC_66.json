        "The facts": "4 On 8 December 2000, Ong and his friend, Ang Kee Leng\n\n(\"Ang\") were with four other friends at the karaoke lounge located at the Civil\n\nDefence Association for National Servicemen (\"CDANS\") Country Club at Bukit\n\nBatok West Avenue 7 for drinks and a karaoke session.5 The appellant was present at the same karaoke lounge with a group of\n\nabout 20 of his friends. Around midnight, the appellant left the company of his friends\n\nand played pool at the pub outside the karaoke lounge.6 At about 1 am on 9 December 2000, Ong and Ang left the CDANS premises\n\non Ong’s motorcycle to buy cigarettes from a nearby petrol kiosk. A party of the\n\nappellant’s friends left the karaoke lounge at around the same time. This group\n\nincluded various witnesses who testified for the prosecution: Thulasidas s/o Sahadevan\n\n(\"Thulasidas\"), Yeo Kwan Loong (\"Yeo\"), Kenny Cheong Wei Long\n\n(\"Kenny\") and three other prosecution witnesses who are minors and shall be\n\nreferred to as PW6, PW7 and PW8.7 Members of the group claimed that Ong deliberately revved his\n\nmotorcycle engine loudly as he passed them. Ong proceeded to execute a U-turn and as he\n\nrode pass them a second time, he revved his engine loudly again. As such, the group felt\n\nprovoked.8 Yeo, Thulasidas, PW6 and PW8 then confronted Ong and Ang. In the\n\nmidst of the confrontation, Thulasidas shouted at Ong and punched his face. Various\n\nmembers of the group then attacked Ong, kicking and punching him with their arms and legs.9 Upon witnessing the attack, Ang tried to help Ong but was stopped and\n\npunched on his neck. He managed to escape and went to seek help from his friends who were\n\nstill in the karaoke lounge. When they returned, the group had fled.10 Ong was treated at the National University Hospital as an\n\noutpatient. In the medical report, the examining medical officer noted that Ong suffered a\n\nfracture on the tip of his nose and had various bruises on his head.",
        "The court below": "11 The appellant’s main defence was that he was not an active\n\nparticipant in the assault. The prosecution called a total of nine witnesses, while the\n\ndefence only put the appellant on the stand.",
        "The victims": "12 The two victims, Ong and Ang, did not identify the appellant in\n\npolice identification parades. They were only able to identify Thulasidas and Yeo and\n\ntheir evidence did not shed light on whether the appellant was involved. Hence, the trial\n\njudge found that their testimonies were unhelpful in determining if the appellant had been\n\npresent at the commencement of the assault or whether he had a role in the assault.",
        "Thulasidas and Yeo": "13 The prosecution also called the various participants in the assault\n\nto the stand. Thulasidas testified that he had only seen Yeo and PW8 on his side when the\n\nassault took place. When asked whether he remembered seeing the appellant after he left\n\nCDANS, he replied that he had only seen the appellant at the karaoke lounge and had not\n\nnoticed him after that. Yeo then took the stand but his evidence was largely unhelpful as\n\nwell. To begin with, he had consumed some beer at the karaoke lounge and he admitted to\n\nbeing inebriated by the time he left the CDANS premises. Furthermore, Yeo said that he was\n\nso preoccupied with the assault that he did not notice whether the appellant was present\n\nor whether he had taken part in the assault at all.14 On the whole, the judge found the testimonies of Thulasidas and Yeo\n\nto be unhelpful as they were uncertain as to whether the appellant was part of the group\n\nthat confronted Ong. They were also unable to say for sure whether the appellant was\n\nactually involved in the assault. As such, she held that their evidence was neutral in\n\ndetermining the appellant’s involvement.",
        "Kenny": "41 The appellant argued that the judge had erred in finding that Kenny\n\nhad fabricated his evidence because of his failure to mention the exculpatory evidence in\n\nearlier statements to the police. In her judgment, the judge stated that she preferred\n\nPW6’s evidence given in his police statements and in his examination-in-chief over\n\nKenny’s testimony.42 In his long statement recorded at 8.35 pm on 10 January 2001\n\n(\"D1\"), Kenny provided a narrative account of how the assault took place. In his\n\ncautioned statement recorded at 8.20 pm on 10 January 2001 (\"D2\"), the sole\n\ncontents were a record of his denial of having been involved in the assault. Notably, no\n\nspecific questions were directed at him then with regard to the degree of the\n\nappellant’s participation in the assault.43 In my opinion, Kenny’s failure to list out all the names of\n\npersons who were not active assailants cannot be regarded as a failure to mention the\n\nexculpatory evidence. While section 121(2) of theCriminal Procedure Code(Cap 68)\n\nbinds a person to state truly the facts and circumstances concerning the case with which\n\nhe is acquainted, except that which may incriminate him, the question put to him by the\n\ninvestigating officer was about the identities of the persons who had assaulted Ong.\n\nKenny’s reply was to list Yeo, Thulasidas, PW6 and PW8 as the assailants. It could\n\nnot have been expected of him to list out the names of all the persons who did not take\n\npart in the assault.44 Further, I noted that the prosecution had not impeached Kenny’s\n\ncredit. He was also the only witness who testified to being able to recognise the\n\nappellant even from his back, due to his distinctive height. The fact that Kenny was not\n\nan active participant but remained a bystander throughout the assault was important since\n\nhe was in a position to fully observe the events. On the whole, Kenny’s story was not\n\nincredible and he had merely testified to what he had seen. As such, I found that\n\nKenny’s testimony should be given great weight.",
        "PW6": "18 The testimony of 15-year old PW6 was controversial. He recounted\n\nthat in the midst of the fight, Ong’s helmet had fallen to the ground. Thinking of\n\nusing it to hit Ong, he picked up the helmet, but Thulasidas snatched it from him and\n\nproceeded to use it to hit the motorcycle. He testified that it was at this juncture that\n\nhe witnessed the appellant approaching Ong who had by this time fallen to the ground. The\n\nappellant was then alleged to have used his fists to punch Ong twice in his back.19 However, when it was made known to him that the appellant was being\n\ncharged with rioting and not the less serious unlawful assembly charge that he had pleaded\n\nguilty to, PW6 changed his testimony and said that it was possible that he was mistaken\n\nabout the appellant’s role in the assault. Hisvolte-facethrew his earlier\n\nunequivocal statements into doubt. At this point, the prosecution applied to impeach\n\nPW6’s credit by introducing his previous statements.20 The prosecution first referred to PW6’s statement to the police\n\ndated 14 December 2000, (\"P2\"). The prosecution pointed out that in the course\n\nof his oral testimony, PW6 had said that he did not notice the appellant’s presence\n\nwhen Yeo, Thulasidas, PW8 and himself first confronted Ong. In P2 however, PW6 had said\n\nthat the appellant was part of the first group that had approached Ong; therein lay the\n\nmaterial inconsistency. In reply, PW6 maintained that the appellant was not present when\n\nthe confrontation occurred.21 Next, the prosecution pointed out that in P2, PW6 had alleged that\n\nthe appellant had used his hands to punch Ong’s body. PW6 disagreed and claimed that\n\nhe was nervous and confused after having been locked up in the Jurong Police Station\n\nlock-up for two days. He maintained his new position that he had probably been mistaken\n\nwhen he gave the statement. When it was pointed out to him that his allegation in P2 was\n\nconsistent with his evidence given during examination-in-chief, PW6 claimed that during\n\nexamination-in-chief, he was also feeling ‘nervous and confused’ since it\n\nwas his first time in court. He claimed that, in the course of the hearing, he had a\n\nrethink about the events of the night of the assault and felt that he had been mistaken\n\nabout the appellant’s participation in the assault.22 In her judgment, the judge held that the prosecution had\n\nsuccessfully impeached PW6’s credit. She rejected his explanations for his change in\n\ntestimony and said that it was apparent from his 2 May 2001 statement (which she noted was\n\nless than two weeks before the commencement of the appellant’s trial) that he\n\ncontinued to hold the view that the appellant was an assailant and had even provided\n\ndetails on the manner he carried out the assault. This latest statement from PW6, she\n\nnoted, was consistent with his evidence given before hisvolte-face. The judge\n\nfound that, on the whole, before he changed his testimony, PW6’s evidence was\n\ngenerally consistent and he was a coherent and clear witness. As such, she preferred his\n\nevidence given in his police statements and in his examination-in-chief.",
        "The remaining prosecution witnesses": "23 15-year old PW7 testified that, when the first group confronted Ong,\n\nhe saw the appellant walking/running towards them. After the assault began, he saw the\n\nappellant standing close to the pavement where the assault was taking place. He testified\n\nthat halfway through it, he did not notice the appellant there anymore. However, he\n\nconceded that this was probably because his attention was centred on the assault.24 15 year old PW8 was an active participant in the assault. He\n\ntestified that during the assault, things were very chaotic and, as he was not looking out\n\nfor the appellant, he was unable to say with certainty whether he was present or involved\n\nin any way.25 With respect to both their testimonies, the judge noted that, like\n\nThulasidas and Yeo, they were unable to say with certainty whether the appellant was an\n\nassailant. As such, she held that their evidence was neutral in determining the\n\nappellant’s involvement.",
        "The defence case": "26 The appellant was the only witness produced by the defence. He\n\ntestified that he was playing pool with some strangers at the pub outside the karaoke\n\nlounge for most of the evening and was unaware that his friends had already left when the\n\nlounge started closing. After a phone call to a friend who informed him that the group was\n\nheaded for a coffeeshop, he left the CDANS premises alone to catch up with them. At this\n\npoint, the appellant said that he saw Thulasidas kicking a motorcycle and it was then that\n\nhe realised that a fight was unfolding. He went closer and watched at a distance of one to\n\ntwo metres for about 20 to 30 seconds. He stressed that he did not join in. Later, feeling\n\nincreasing unease about being at the scene, he ran away.27 In the course of his cross-examination, the prosecution applied to\n\nimpeach the appellant’s credit on three inconsistencies. First, it was contended that\n\nin his long statement dated 9 January 2001 (\"P9\"), he had mentioned a staring\n\nincident which was said to have occurred whilst he was at the lounge. In his oral\n\ntestimony however, the appellant had stated that there was no staring incident at the\n\nCDANS premises. In reply, the appellant explained that since the person involved in the\n\nstaring incident was not Ong, he did not think that there was a need to mention it as it\n\nwas an unrelated incident.28 Secondly, the prosecution pointed out that in P9 the appellant had\n\nstated that he had personally heard someone saying that Ong’s act of revving the\n\nmotorcycle was the cause of the assault. As such, the appellant was well-aware that\n\nOng’s act of revving the motorcycle engine repeatedly was the direct cause of the\n\nassault and that the appellant’s claim during trial that he did not know why his\n\ngroup of friends had attacked Ong was a fabrication. In reply, the appellant explained\n\nthat Ong’s revving of his motorcycle as stated in P9 was a matter that was disclosed\n\nto him in the aftermath of the assault by his friends. He explained that when the\n\nstatement was recorded, he had included his friends’ version of events. The appellant\n\ninsisted that at the time of the assault, he did not have personal knowledge of what the\n\ncause of it was.29 Thirdly, the prosecution pointed out that the phrase \"before\n\nreaching the coffeeshop\" which appeared in P9 indicated that the appellant did\n\nnot actually arrive at the coffeeshop. However, during his oral testimony, the appellant\n\nstated that he had spoken to three of his friends at the coffeeshop for less than one\n\nminute. When queried on the alleged inconsistency, the appellant explained that his actual\n\nmeaning during oral testimony was that he was never inside the coffeeshop but only stood\n\n\"beside\" and \"near\" to the coffeeshop.30 In her judgment, the judge accepted the appellant’s explanation\n\nthat he had omitted to mention the staring incident at the karaoke lounge because it had\n\nseemed to him to be an unrelated matter. However, the judge felt that the appellant was\n\nnot truthful when he claimed that he had not personally heard the exchange of words\n\nbetween the group and Ong. She also rejected the appellant’s use of the phrase \"before\n\nreaching the coffeeshop\" to mean \"outside\" or \"near\"\n\nthe coffeeshop. She held that, if the appellant really meant to say that he did not enter\n\nthe coffeeshop but only spoke to his friends \"near\" or \"beside\"\n\nit, he was capable of enunciating his stated position. The judge found that the\n\nappellant’s credit was not impeached in toto, and that he was part of the group that\n\nhad assaulted Ong. Accordingly, she convicted the appellant.",
        "The appeal": "31 The main question that arose in the appeal was: did the judge err in\n\ncoming to the conclusion that the appellant was actively involved in the assault?32 In the petition of appeal, the appellant argued that the judge was\n\nwrong to have found that PW6’s and the appellant’s credit were impeached. It was\n\nalso contended that the judge erred in finding that Kenny had fabricated his evidence in\n\ncourt.",
        "Corroboration": "33 The crucial witness for the prosecution was PW6 who was 15 years old\n\nat the time he testified. As he is regarded as a young witness, the traditional concerns\n\nof whether he had attained sufficient maturity not to be swayed by personal interests and\n\nfantasy, and understood the importance of stating the truth on oath applied. In certain\n\ncases, the law requires corroboration for evidence given by such young witnesses because\n\nit is considered unsafe to convict solely on that witness’s testimony alone. This was\n\nset out in the recent case ofLee Kwang Peng v PP[1997] 3 SLR 278. InLee,\n\nthe witnesses were between 12-14 years of age and it was stated at para 64:…Where, therefore, evidence is given by older children whose\n\n  intellectual faculties are more developed, the danger in convicting without corroboration\n\n  is diminished. The rationale of the rule makes it very difficult to lay down a guideline\n\n  as to the point at which a maturing individual, in his progress towards adulthood, crosses\n\n  the line past which the judicial process considers his testimony credible without\n\n  independent evidence in support of it and this must therefore be a matter for the\n\n  judge’s assessment in each case.34 Whether corroboration is required for evidence given by a child\n\nwitness is a matter for the judge to weigh in coming to a determination on the issues.\n\nObviously, a judge who has had the benefit of observing the demeanour and conduct of the\n\nchild witness would be in a far better position to judge if corroboration is required in\n\nthe circumstances of the case. An appellate court would not readily interfere with such a\n\nfinding.35 However, in the current case, there were overwhelming reasons to\n\nregard the evidence given by PW6 with suspicion.36 It was clear from the evidence that PW6 was predisposed to easy\n\ninfluence from his peers. By his own admission, he had gone over to kick Ong because he\n\nhad observed his friends assaulting him. The whimsical changes in his testimony indicated\n\nthat he was unaware of the implications and consequences of lying under oath. His\n\ntestimony in court also contained several discrepancies from his earlier statements. As\n\nsuch, I held that he did not fall into the category of persons with more mature\n\nintellectual faculties and that it would be unsafe to convict solely on his testimony\n\nwithout any corroboration. The prosecution did not adduce any evidence which corroborated\n\nPW6’s evidence.",
        "Material inconsistencies": "37 Quite apart from the general caution required, I noted that there\n\nwere several other material inconsistencies in PW6’s evidence.38 In court, PW6 stated that he had met the appellant for the first\n\ntime on the night of the assault. He testified that he did know of any way to contact the\n\nappellant nor did he exchange phone numbers with him. However, during cross-examination,\n\nit was revealed that from as early as one month before the assault, that is, in November\n\n2000, PW6 was already well-acquainted with the appellant. In fact, they were both called\n\nup by the police for playing with a fire extinguisher in school. When faced with this\n\nrevelation, PW6 changed his story and said that he first got to know the appellant when\n\nthe mischief involving the fire-extinguisher was committed. Further, I noted that in P2,\n\nPW6 had provided rough details of the appellant’s home address and in particular, was\n\nable to recite the appellant’s handphone number from memory. PW6 was clearly lying\n\nwhen he testified that he had met the appellant for the first time on 8 December 1999 and\n\nwas not acquainted with him.39 I also noted that PW6 testified that Thulasidas was the first one to\n\npunch Ong on his face. In P2, PW6 stated that \"Kwan Long\" i.e. Yeo, had used his\n\nright hand to punch Ong on the face twice and this led to the others joining in the\n\nfracas. This was plainly wrong and the testimonies of all the other witnesses stated\n\nconclusively that it was Thulasidas, not Yeo, who had thrown the first punch. In the\n\ncontext that P2 was recorded on 14 December 2000, less than a week after the assaults, I\n\nfound that this was a patent error for someone who was present at the initial\n\nconfrontation. It showed that the evidence given by PW6 ought not be believed.40 None of the above inconsistencies were highlighted to the court by\n\ncounsel. The combined effect of these discrepancies, together with the whimsical changes\n\nin his testimony indicated that PW6 was totally devoid of any credit. In fact, I found\n\nthat his evidence was suspiciously detailed and systematic. For a person who was actively\n\ninvolved with assaulting Ong, it was hard to believe that he could give such a methodical,\n\nstep-by-step account of the assault. None of the other participants was able to come close\n\nto such a feat.",
        "The appellant": "45 The judge had impeached the appellant’s credit on the basis of\n\ntwo material inconsistencies in his previous statements. The first was in P9 where he had\n\nstated \"I remember hearing someone askwhy they rammed their motorcycled\n\nengine, but he[Ong]denied it.\" On the basis of this statement, the judge\n\nheld that the appellant was at the scene of the assault when it first started and in the\n\nlight of the appellant’s own testimony that he had stood one to two metres from the\n\nscene of the assault, he was well-placed to hear the altercation between the group and\n\nOng. As such, it was held that he did not arrive in the midst of the assault as he claimed\n\nin his testimony, but was lying when he denied that he did not know what the cause of the\n\nassault was.46 Evaluating the evidence, it appeared that the appellant only arrived\n\nafter Yeo, Thulasidas, PW6 and PW8 confronted Ong, at the point when Thulasidas was\n\nkicking Ong’s motorcycle. This was corroborated by the testimonies given by the other\n\nprosecution witnesses. In fact, none of them testified that the appellant was present at\n\nthe scene when the initial confrontation took place. This was simply because he was not\n\nthere.47 Since the appellant could not have personally heard the exchange of\n\nwords that transpired between the group and Ong in the first instance, I was of the view\n\nthat the appellant had included in P9 what he believed to be the provocation leading to\n\nthe assault after discussing the assault with his friends in its aftermath. As such, I\n\ndisagreed with the judge that this was a material inconsistency which ought to be taken\n\ninto account to impeach the appellant’s credit.48 As for the second inconsistency, in his evidence in court, the\n\nappellant stated that he was at the coffeeshop for less than one minute and, whilst there,\n\nhe told three of his friends about the assault. He claimed that he did not have any drinks\n\nat the coffeeshop. However, the prosecution claimed that the appellant’s use of the\n\nphrase \"Before reaching the coffeeshop…\" in P9 indicated that the\n\nappellant never reached the coffeeshop. Therein lay the discrepancy. In reply, the\n\nappellant explained that by \"Before reaching the coffeeshop…\" he\n\nreally meant that he did not actually step into the premises of the coffeeshop and he had\n\ntalked to his friends who were standing just outside the coffeeshop. The judge, however,\n\nfound that this was a material inconsistency and took this into consideration in\n\nimpeaching the appellant’s credit.49 In my opinion, the dispute as to whether the appellant actually\n\nreached the premises of the coffeeshop was decided on the basis of semantics. As I stated\n\nrecently inMohammed Zairi bin Mohamad Mohtar v PP[2002] 1 SLR 344, at para 33:It is settled law that the credibility of a witness cannot be impeached\n\n  unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between his oral\n\n  testimony and his previous police statements:Muthusamy v PP[1948] MLJ 57 . ‘Material’ inconsistencies are those inconsistencies that go to\n\n  the crux of the charges against the appellants:Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP[1998] 2 SLR 592. In determining whether the credit of the accused or a witness has been\n\n  impeached, the court will compare the oral evidence with the previous statement to assess\n\n  the overall impression which has been created as a whole:PP v Heah Lian Khin[2000] 3 SLR 609.50 Whether the appellant actually stepped into the coffeeshop or had\n\nmerely stood \"beside\" or \"near\" it was inconsequential\n\nand certainly not material enough to go towards impeaching his credit. As such, I\n\ndisagreed with the judge that this should be a material consideration to justify a finding\n\nthat the appellant was without credit.51 At this juncture, I found it helpful to refer to the Court of\n\nAppeal’s judgment inLoganatha Venkatesan v PP[2000] 3 SLR 677, 695 :… it is important to bear in mind that an impeachment of the\n\n  witness’s credit does not automatically lead to a total rejection of his evidence.\n\n  The court must carefully scrutinise the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect\n\n  might be true and which aspect should be disregarded: seePP v Somwang\n\n  Phatthanasaeng[1992] 1 SLR 138(HC) andKwang Boon Keong Peter(supra).\n\n  Thus, regardless of whether his credit is impeached, the duty of the court remains, that\n\n  is, to evaluate the evidence in its entirety to determine which aspect to believe.52 Applying this to the current case, I found that various aspects of\n\nthe appellant’s testimony were consistent with the evidence given by the prosecution\n\nwitnesses. The appellant’s version of events was that when he emerged from the CDANS\n\npremises, Thulasidas was kicking Ong’s motorcycle and he had stood at a distance of\n\none to two metres away and watched the assault for 20-30 seconds. This was generally\n\nconsistent with PW7’s version of events :Q Was Accused one of these 10? [referring to the alleged 10 persons who\n\n  first confronted Ong]A When we approached the victim, then I saw Accused either walking or\n\n  running towards us. When the fight started, I saw Accused standing either on or near the\n\n  pavement.Q Is this next to where the fight was?A Yes.Q Then?A In the middle of the fight, I didn’t notice him there anymore.53 PW7 conceded that he probably did not notice the appellant because\n\nhe \"didn’t really focus my sight on him\". I noted that PW7 was not\n\nan assailant but a bystander who was engrossed with the assault. Had the appellant\n\nactually joined his friends in attacking Ong, PW7 would surely have witnessed it.\n\nSimilarly, Kenny, who was also watching the assault from the sidelines did not testify to\n\nhave observed the appellant assaulting Ong. Even more telling, perhaps, was the fact that\n\nthe assailants, namely Thulasidas, Yeo, PW6 and PW8 were able to name with certainty and\n\naccuracy all the other assailants, but they were all similarly uncertain when asked\n\nwhether the appellant was involved.",
        "Conclusion": "54 Chaos is the hallmark of any riot. Neither statute nor case law has\n\nprovided a qualification to the standard of proof required for conviction, and it must be\n\nreiterated that the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt in an offence of rioting\n\ncontinues to apply strictly. While the prosecution called atotal of nine\n\nwitnesses to the stand, PW6 was the only witness who insisted that the appellant was an\n\nactive assailant. Quite apart from the quality of his evidence, by the time he stepped\n\ndown from the stand, PW6 had already retracted much of his initial testimony and was no\n\nlonger certain if the appellant was an active assailant.55 As for the defence, the appellant as well as Kenny provided firm\n\nexculpatory evidence that the appellant was not involved in assaulting Ong at all.56 While I was keenly conscious that the issues before me were mainly\n\nfactual in nature and that an appellate court should be slow to overturn a trial\n\njudge’s findings of fact unless they were clearly reached against the weight of\n\nevidence or were plainly wrong (Tan Hung Yeoh v PP[1999] 3 SLR 93andPP v Azman bin Abdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704), I was not satisfied\n\non the totality of the evidence that the burden of proof was satisfied.57 For the reasons given above, I allowed the appeal and set aside the\n\nconviction as well as the sentence imposed by the court below.",
