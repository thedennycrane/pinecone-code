        "Whether the action should be struck out": "7       When considering whether or not the respondents’ action should be struck out, reference may first be made to O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed), which provides as follows: (1)The Court may at any stage of the proceedings order to be struck out or amended any pleadingor the endorsement of any writ in the action, or anything in any pleading or in the endorsement,on the ground that —(a)it discloses no reasonable cause of action or defence, as the case may be;(b)it is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious;(c)it may prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; or(d)it is otherwise an abuse of the process of the Court,and may order the action to be stayed or dismissed or judgment to be entered accordingly,as the case may be. 8       As the court’s power to strike out an action is rather draconian, an action should not be too readily struck out. InGabriel Peter & Partners v Wee Chong Jin[1998] 1 SLR 374(“Gabriel Peter”), the Court of Appeal explained at [18] as follows: In general, it is only in plain and obvious cases that the power of striking out should be invoked. … It should not be exercised by a minute and protracted examination of the documents and facts of the case in order to see if the plaintiff really has a cause of action. The practice of the courts has been that, where an application for striking out involves a lengthy and serious argument, the court should decline to proceed with the argument unless, not only does it have doubts as to the soundness of the pleading but, in addition, it is satisfied that striking out will obviate the necessity for a trial or reduce the burden of preparing for a trial. 9       In contrast, where a case is hopelessly doomed to fail, it should be struck out. InBandung Shipping Pte Ltd v Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd[2003] 1 SLR 295, Chao Hick Tin JA noted at [34] that to allow a claim that is hopeless to proceed further for trial would be to compel the defendants to expend time and money in defending a case which obviously had no merit whatsoever. 10     In the present case, the company asserted that the respondents’ claims are doomed to fail because they are unfounded and baseless. The company contended that it is not responsible for the forging of the respondents’ signatures in the crew agreements and pointed out that it is illogical for the respondents to mount a claim for wages long after leaving its employment when they had not complained about the matter when they were its employees. 11     The position is not as straightforward as claimed by the company. The respondents’ counsel, Mr Navinder Singh, relied onLloyd v Grace, Smith & Co[1912] AC 716 for the proposition that depending on the circumstances, an employer may be liable for the fraud of his employee. Mr Singh also asserted that Goh and the company are parties to the fraud against the respondents and that he is entitled to cross-examine Goh and the company’s directors to prove this assertion. I agree that whether or not the company is responsible for Goh’s fraud cannot be decided on the basis of affidavit evidence alone. 12     The company also asserted that some parts of the respondents’ claims are doomed to fail because they are time-barred. However, in respect of the allegedly barred claims, the respondents have pleaded fraud and relied on s 29 of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed), the relevant part of which provides as follows: 29(1)Where, in the case of any action for which a period of limitation is prescribed by this Act –(a)the action is based upon the fraud of the defendant or his agent ….;(b)the right of action is concealed by the fraud of any such person as aforesaid; ….the period of limitation shall not begin to run until the plaintiff has discovered the fraud …or could with reasonable diligence have discovered it. 13     Whether or not the respondents’ claims are time-barred can only be known after issues relating to Goh’s fraud in relation to the crew agreements submitted to the MPA and the company’s liability for his fraud have been fully ventilated at a trial. 14     For the reasons stated, I dismissed the company’s appeal against AR Tan’s decision. The respondents are entitled to costs with respect to the appeal."
