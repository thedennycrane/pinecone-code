        "Introduction": "1       The\nappellant was Boxsentry Pte Ltd (“Boxsentry”), a Singapore-incorporated\ncompany, while the respondent was Eleven Gesellschaft Zur Entwicklung\nUnd Vermarktung Von Netzwerktechonologien MBH (“Eleven”). They had\nentered into a Partner Agreement (“the PA”) to integrate Eleven’s\n“eXpurgate” spam filter and email categorisation service (collectively\nreferred to as the “eXpurgate service”) into Boxsentry’s “RealMail”\napplication. Under the PA, Boxsentry had guaranteed quarterly revenue\npayments for the first three years to Eleven for the use of the eXpurgate\nservice. 2       Boxsentry\nmade payment to Eleven for the first and second quarters of the\nfirst year. However, it failed to make payment for the third and\nfourth quarters of that year. Subsequently, Eleven sued Boxsentry\nin Berlin, Germany, and obtained a default judgment (“the Berlin\ndefault judgment”) against Boxsentry as it had failed to respond\nto Eleven’s claim. Subsequent events led Eleven to take out a Writ\nof Summons in Singapore so as to enforce the Berlin default judgment.\nIn the meantime, Boxsentry took out a summons to stay the enforcement\nproceedings. 3       At\nthe hearing below, the Assistant Registrar (“AR”) granted Eleven’s summary\njudgment application which would allow the enforcement of the Berlin\ndefault judgment in Singapore. The latter’s stay application was dismissed.\nBoxsentry appealed against both the decisions. 4       I\nheard both Registrar’s Appeal No 292 of 2013 (“RA 292”) and Registrar’s\nAppeal No 293 of 2013 (“RA 293”). In RA 292, Boxsentry appealed\nagainst the dismissal of the stay application by the AR. In RA 293, it\nappealed against the grant of summary judgment by the same AR. I dismissed\nboth the appeals.[note: 1]Boxsentry is\ndissatisfied with my decisions and has appealed against them. I\nnow give my reasons for my decisions.",
        "The facts": "5       Boxsentry\nand Eleven were involved in the supply of information technology\nservices. Central to this dispute was the PA entered into by them on\n27 November 2007. 6       Under\nthe terms of the PA, Boxsentry agreed to integrate Eleven’s eXpurgate\nservice into its “RealMail” application. The bundled application would\nthen be sold to certain specified territories where Boxsentry operated in.[note: 2]Those\nterritories were the Asia Pacific region and the Middle East.[note: 3]For\nthe provision of its services, Eleven was guaranteed revenue payments under\ncl 5 of the PA for the first year, second year and third year. Clause\n5 read as follows:[note: 4] 5. Guaranteed\nrevenue / Committed Payments (1)The Partner [Boxsentry] guarantees\nthe following revenue to the Supplier [Eleven]: First year (Nov 2007-Oct 2008)220k€Second year (Nov 2008-Oct 2009)300k€Third year (Nov 2009-Oct 2010)360k€   7       The\nterms of payment were contained in cl 6 of the PA which read as follows: 6. Terms of\nPayment (1)Quarterly payment at the end of the\nquarter (2)For the first year the guaranteed\nrevenue is paid as follows: First quarter15k€ (5k€ in advance at the beginning of the quarter upon\nsigning agreement)Second quarter25k€Third quarter70k€Fourth quarter110k€   (3)Starting with the second year of business the guaranteed revenue\nis paid quarterly in equal shares. As can be seen, the total sum payable to Eleven for the first\nyear was €220,000.[note: 5]",
        "Boxsentry’s breach of the PA": "8       Boxsentry\nhad paid Eleven for the first and second quarters of the first year\nunder the PA. Those payments were €15,000 and €25,000 respectively.[note: 6]However, Boxsentry failed to make\npayment for the third and fourth quarters. The facts below illustrate\nthe sequence of events that took place between Boxsentry and Eleven\nafter the first and second quarter payments. 9       On\n6 August 2008, Eleven sent an invoice for the third quarter payment\nto Boxsentry. The latter did not reply.[note: 7]Eleven subsequently\nsent an email to Boxsentry on 29 October 2008 to remind Boxsentry\nof its obligations to make payment for the third quarter within\nthe next 14 days.[note: 8]Boxsentry eventually\nreplied Eleven, stating that the eXpurgate service had not performed\nup to expectations. Boxsentry also alleged that this problem had\nbeen raised to Eleven on several occasions but to no avail. This\nhad caused damage to Boxsentry’s reputation.[note: 9]For that reason, Boxsentry rescinded\nthe PA on the ground of misrepresentation.[note: 10] 10     On\n20 November 2008, Eleven sent an email to Boxsentry, stating that there\nwas no legal basis for a premature termination of the PA or a cessation of\nthe business relationship between them.[note: 11]Eleven also\ndemanded Boxsentry to make the payments for the third and fourth\nquarters. Boxsentry replied in its email dated 15 December 2008\nthat it would not make any further payment.[note: 12] 11     Under\nthe PA, German law governed the PA and the parties had agreed to\nsubmit to the Berlin court’s exclusive jurisdiction.[note: 13]On\nthat basis, Eleven commenced legal action again Boxsentry in Berlin\non 19 February 2009. Subsequently, German court documents were served\non Boxsentry in Singapore informing it that legal proceedings had\nbeen commenced by Eleven against it. 12     Boxsentry\nignored the Berlin legal proceedings. Accordingly, Berlin Regional\nCourt issued the default judgment against Boxsentry. That judgment\nwas served on Boxsentry but it continued to ignore the Berlin legal\nproceedings. When Eleven issued a letter of demand to enforce the default\njudgment in Singapore, Boxsentry again failed to respond.",
        "The present proceedings": "13     Exasperated,\nEleven commenced the present proceedings in Singapore to enforce\nthe Berlin default judgment under the common law. The Writ of Summons,\ntogether with the endorsed Statement of Claim, was served on Boxsentry,\nwhich finally entered its appearance on 24 August 2012. It filed\nits defence and counterclaim against Eleven on 12 September 2012.[note: 14]On 27 September 2012,\nEleven filed an application for a stay of proceedings in relation\nto Boxsentry’s counterclaim. The parties agreed to this application.\nAccordingly, the court granted the stay in relation to Boxsentry’s\ncounterclaim by consent on 22 October 2012.[note: 15] 14     On\n23 November 2012, Eleven applied for summary judgment under O 14\nr 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”) in Summons\nNo 6024 of 2012 (“SUM 6024”) against Boxsentry. This was to enforce\nthe Berlin default judgment.[note: 16]Boxsentry\nretaliated by commencing Civil Action Case No 98 O9/13 in Berlin\nto set aside the Berlin default judgment and to restrain Eleven\nfrom enforcing the Berlin default judgment (“the Berlin restrain\naction”).[note: 17]It also filed\nan application to stay the present action in Summons No 3974 of\n2013 (“SUM 3974”) pending the outcome of the Berlin proceedings.\nThe AR granted Eleven its application for summary judgment and dismissed\nBoxsentry’s application for a stay of proceedings. Boxsentry appealed\nagainst both his orders.[note: 18]",
        "Boxsentry’s restrain action\nin Berlin to prevent Eleven from enforcing the Berlin’s default\njudgment in Singapore": "15     Subsequently,\nthe Berlin restrain action was heard in the Berlin High Court on\n1 April 2014. The Berlin High Court ruled against Boxsentry on 13\nMay 2014.[note: 19]Boxsentry\nfiled an appeal on 13 June 2014 (“the Berlin appeal”). In its appeal,\nBoxsentry sought to set aside the Berlin judgment as well as another\ndefault judgment (see [28(i)] and [43]) issued against it and also\nto transfer the case to be heard before the Senate. If it again\nfailed in its action, Boxsentry then would ask for its case to be\ntransferred to the Federal Supreme Court of Germany.[note: 20]Boxsentry\ninformed me that the appeal would be heard in Berlin at the end\nof October 2014 or in early November 2014.[note: 21]",
        "The issues before me": "16     The\nissues on appeal were thus twofold: (a)     whether\nthe present action should be stayed in the light of the concurrent\nBerlin proceedings; and (b)     whether\nI should grant summary judgment on the strength of the Berlin default\njudgment.",
        "The application to stay enforcement\nof the Berlin default judgment": "",
        "The AR’s reasons for dismissing\nthe stay application": "17     At\nthe hearing below, the AR dismissed Boxsentry’s stay application. He\nheld that while international comity was an important consideration,\nhe had to consider two issues. First, whether Boxsentry’s application\nto restrain Eleven from enforcing the Berlin default judgment in\nSingapore wasbona fideand second,\nwhether Eleven would be put through further delay and expense in\nrecovering what it was rightfully entitled to. The AR was of the\nview that Boxsentry’s actions appeared to be calculated to delay the\ncurrent proceedings. Thus he did not grant a stay.[note: 22]",
        "Boxsentry’s submissions": "68     On\nappeal, Boxsentry’s case was that Eleven had not proven that it was\nentitled to summary judgment. This was because there were triable issues\nthat would be more suitably determined at trial. Alternatively,\nthere was a considerable degree of complexity and detail which went\nagainst Eleven’s case for summary judgment. Lastly, the present\nproceedings ought to be adjourned pending the Berlin appeal.[note: 53] Triable issues were present 69     Boxsentry\nsubmitted that the following triable issues arose for determination. (I)   The Berlin default\njudgment was not final and conclusive on the merits 70     First,\nBoxsentry submitted that the Berlin default judgment could not be\nfinal and conclusive on its merits. This was because it was obtained\nas a default judgment and no arguments had presented on the merits\nof Eleven’s claim. Second, the Berlin court had not made findings\non the merits of the case.[note: 54] 71     For\nthe above two reasons, Boxsentry submitted that the present case was\ndistinguishable fromHong Pian Tee v Les Placements\nGermain Gauthier Inc[2002] 1 SLR(R) 515 (“Hong Pian Tee”) andBellezza\nClub Japan Co Ltd v Matsumura Akihiko and others[2010]\n3 SLR 342 (“Bellezza”) as those\ncases did not deal with the enforcement of default judgments.[note: 55]Those were\nalso the reasons why Eleven could not assert that the matter ought\nnot to be re-litigated since it had never been litigated in the\nfirst place.[note: 56] (II)   The Berlin default\njudgment had been procured by fraud 72     Boxsentry\nnext submitted that the Berlin default judgment had been procured\nby fraud. According to Dr Czychowski, Eleven had failed to give full\nand frank disclosure of the background facts in obtaining the Berlin default\njudgment. Eleven had also suppressed facts in order to obtain the Berlin\ndefault judgment against Boxsentry. Those actions constituted fraud under\nGerman law.[note: 57] 73     Additionally,\nBoxsentry submitted that Eleven had erred in its interpretation\nofHong Pian TeeandBellezza. In its view, Eleven had taken the\nposition that allegations of fraud must be based on evidence which\narose subsequent to the grant of the foreign judgment. However Boxsentry submitted\nthat the approach was wrong. In its view, those cases indicated that\nforeign judgments could be challenged on the ground of fraud when:[note: 58] (a)     fresh\nevidence was uncovered; (b)     the\ndefendant had failed to uncover the fresh evidence earlier despite\nhis reasonable diligence in doing so; and (c)     the\nfresh evidence would have made a difference in the eventual outcome\nof the case. On that basis, Boxsentry submitted that it was not seeking\nto introduce the same evidence of fraud presented in the Berlin\nRegional Court but rather, it was the first time that it was presenting\nsuch evidence. Therefore, the Singapore court was not precluded\nfrom making a finding that the Berlin default judgment was tainted\nby fraud.[note: 59] 74     Third,\nBoxsentry submitted that it had recently uncovered a new piece of\nevidence which could not have been obtained previously even with reasonable\ndiligence. Boxsentry further submitted that an adjournment ought\nto be granted at the very least pending the Berlin appeal. (III)   The Berlin default\njudgment had been obtained in breach of natural justice 75     Boxsentry\nsubmitted that the Berlin default judgment was obtained in breach\nof natural justice as Boxsentry did not have the opportunity to present\nits case. Additionally, the court papers had been served improperly and\nthat constituted one of the restrictions on the registration of Commonwealth\njudgments in s 3(2)(c) of the Reciprocal\nEnforcement of Commonwealth Judgments Act (Cap 264, 1985 Rev Ed)\n(“RECJA”). In Boxsentry’s view, that restriction should similarly\napply to the recognition and enforcement of foreign judgments under\nthe common law.[note: 60] Complex and conflicting issues\nof fact were present 76     Boxsentry’s\nnext submission on appeal was that there were complex and conflicting\nissues of fact which militated against the grant of summary judgment.\nInstead, since there were complex and conflicting issues of fact, unconditional\nleave to defend the action should have been granted.[note: 61]First, Boxsentry\nsubmitted that the “sheer length and volume of the affidavits filed\nby the parties speak of the complex issues of fact involved”. The\nissues related to the PA, its breach and the service of the documents\nin the Berlin legal proceedings.[note: 62] 77     Second,\nit was Boxsentry’s position that there were defects in the eXpurgate\nservice. It alleged that the defects were caused by Eleven after\nthe PA was signed which rendered the eXpurgate service unfit for\nuse.[note: 63]Whilst\nit was true that Boxsentry had tested the eXpurgate service before signing\nthe PA, Eleven had total control over the eXpurgate service and\nit could change the algorithms or methodology at any time. Therefore,\nthe testing of the service was irrelevant if it could be changed\nso readily.[note: 64]",
        "Eleven’s submissions": "The Berlin default judgment\nis final and conclusive 78     Eleven\nresponded by submitting that the Berlin default judgment had satisfied\nthe criteria for enforcement under the common law. It was undisputed\nthat the Berlin default judgment was a foreign judgment givenin personamby a court of competent jurisdiction\nand for a definite sum of money.[note: 65]It\nwas final and conclusive, notwithstanding the fact that it was a default\njudgment. This would be compliant with the guidelines inBellezzawhich had adopted the following\ntest for determining finality (at [14]): The test of finality is the treatment of\nthe judgment by the foreign tribunal asres\njudicata. ‘In order to establish that [a final and conclusive]\njudgment has been pronounced, it must be shown that in the court\nby which it was pronounced, it conclusively, finally, and forever\nestablished the existence of the debt of which it is sought to be\nmade conclusive evidence in this country, so as to make itres judicatabetween the parties.’A foreign judgment which is liable to be abrogated\nor varied by the court which pronounced it is not a final judgment.\n[emphasis added] 79     Default\njudgments have been held to be final and conclusive (Vanquelin v Bouard(1863) 15 CB (NS) 341).\nBut to determine the issue of finality, it is necessary to have\nregard to evidence of foreign law:Carl Zeiss Siftung\nv Rayner & Keeler Ltd (No 2)[1967] 1 AC 853 at 919.\nDr Klaus’s evidence was that the Berlin default judgment was final\nand conclusive. His evidence had not been challenged on this point.[note: 66] The exceptions to the enforcement\nof the Berlin default judgment did not apply 80     Eleven\nalso submitted that none of the three exceptions to enforcement\nof the Berlin default judgment applied. The public policy exception\nhad not been relied on while the breach of natural justice exception\nwas neither pursued in the affidavits which were filed in respect of\nSUM 6024 nor at the hearing below. The main contention was with regards\nto the fraud exception, which Boxsentry submitted should apply to bar\nenforcement (see above at [72]).[note: 67] (I)   The requirements\ninHong Pian Teehad not been met 81     Eleven\nsubmitted that this court should not consider the merits of Boxsentry’s\nfraud allegations.Hong Pian Teewas\nclear that an allegation of intrinsic fraud should not be entertained\nwhen the evidence was available to the parties at the time of the\nearlier foreign proceedings. Since the evidence that Boxsentry was\nrelying on had existed when the Berlin legal proceedings were commenced,\nthe fraud allegations should not be entertained as Boxsentry had\nmade a conscious choice not to defend the Berlin action.[note: 68] 82     Second,\nEleven submitted that it had not suppressed any facts in obtaining\nthe Berlin default judgment. It had been upfront with the Berlin Regional\nCourt as it had stated in the Berlin SOC that Boxsentry had previously\nalleged that there were defects in the eXpurgate service.[note: 69] 83     Third,\nthe AR had found that the material was unlikely to make any difference\nto the outcome of the Berlin proceedings as they merely reflected isolated\nincidences of the eXpurgate service’s failure.[note: 70]Therefore Boxsentry’s\nallegation of fraud was baseless and unsustainable. (II)   Boxsentry’s receipt\nof bad legal advice was a bare allegation and irrelevant 84     Eleven\nsubmitted that Boxsentry’s allegation that it did not respond to Eleven’s\nactions in Berlin because of bad legal advice was a bare assertion. Boxsentry\nhad neither waived legal advice privilege nor shown evidence to support\nits allegation.[note: 71]The\nreceipt of wrong legal advice was a matter between Boxsentry and\nits lawyers. It should not affect Eleven’s rights.[note: 72]If it was true that\nBoxsentry received wrong legal advice, Boxsentry would not have\nremained silent for nearly three years.[note: 73]Therefore\nthe fraud exception did not apply. (III)   Boxsentry’s allegation\nof the eXpurgate software’s defectiveness was baseless 85     Finally,\nEleven submitted that Boxsentry’s allegation with respect to the\ndefectiveness of the eXpurgate’s software had no merit for the following reasons:[note: 74] (a)     Boxsentry\nhad not produced any evidence of the alleged defects in the eXpurgate\nservice. Its allegation of defects and fraud rested on one isolated\nincident in which Eleven acknowledged there was misclassification.\nThere was no evidence that other customers had been affected by\nthe misclassifications of emails by the eXpurgate service. Almost\nsix months after the PA’s commencement, Boxsentry sent an email\nto thank Eleven for its support. No mention was made about the eXpurgate\nservice being defective. (b)     There\nwas no concealment of facts by Eleven as it had raised the issue\nof the PA’s termination and the allegation of defects in the eXpurgate\nservice by Boxsentry in the Berlin SOC, which was sent to Boxsentry. (c)     Boxsentry\npaid for first and second quarters of the first year without any\nprotest, objection and/or qualification. It also did not demand\na refund of the payments made or bring a counterclaim for them. (d)     There\nwas a gap of more than two months between the time that Eleven first\nasked for the third quarter payment and the point at which Boxsentry\nsought to terminate the PA. If the service was truly defective,\nit would have raised them earlier. (e)     Boxsentry\ntested the eXpurgate service for about seven months prior to signing\nthe PA. It would not have entered into the PA if it was as defective\nas it said it was. It continued to use the eXpurgate service for\nabout one year and eight months after it purportedly terminated the\nPA. (f)     Boxsentry\ndid not respond when Eleven tried to find out what the defects were.\nFurthermore the allegations of Boxsentry were inconsistent with\nthe evidence tendered. Boxsentry alleged that there were defects\nfrom the inception of the PA but it had only tendered evidence showing\nmisclassified emails arising from 2 October 2008 or later. (g)     Boxsentry\ndid not raise any issues with respect to the eXpurgate service when\nEleven commenced the Berlin legal proceedings. It also did not raise\nany issues after the Berlin default judgment was entered against\nit despite having been personally served with the judgment. 86     Therefore\nBoxsentry’s allegation of fraud was baseless and unsustainable.",
        "My decision on the stay application": "29     Both\nsides agreed that the court has jurisdiction and power to grant\na stay of proceedings. This discretion had to be exercised judiciously\nand it was the exercise of this discretion that the parties disagreed\nupon. The factors that the court should\nconsider for a stay application 30     Paragraph\n9 of the First Schedule to the SCJA is instructive on the factors\nthat the court should consider in its exercise of its power to stay\na proceeding: Stay of proceedings 9.    Power\nto dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res\njudicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity\nof proceedings in any court or courts or by reason of a court in\nSingapore not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought\nnot to be continued. 31     InSterling Pharmaceuticals Pty Ltd v Boots & Co\n(Aust) Pty Ltd(1992) 34 FCR 287 (“Sterling\nPharmaceuticals”) at [15], Lockhart J listed several factors\nthat the court should consider in an application for a stay: (a)     which\nproceeding was commenced first; (b)     whether\nthe termination of one proceeding is likely to have an impact on\nthe other; (c)     the\npublic interest; (d)     the\nundesirability of two courts competing to see which of them determines\ncommon facts first; (e)     consideration\nof witness circumstances; (f)     whether\nwork done on pleadings, particulars, discovery, interrogatories\nand preparation might be wasted; (g)     the\nundesirability of a substantial waste of time and effort if it became\na common practice to bring actions in two courts involving substantially\nthe same issues; (h)     how\nfar advanced the proceedings are in each court; (i)     the\ninterest of the law in striving against allowing multiplicity of proceedings\nin relation to similar issues; and (j)     generally\nbalancing the advantages and disadvantages to each party. 32     The\nfactors listed inSterling Pharmaceuticalsare\nuseful guides that can be applied for any case where there is an\napplication for a stay of proceedings. InBella\nProducts Pty Ltd v Creative Designs International Ltd[2009]\nFCA 868 at [23], the Federal Court of Australia endorsed the factors listed\nbySterling Pharmaceuticals. It\nheld that it was undesirable that there were two courts determining\nthe same dispute (see alsoChan Chin Cheungat\n[46]) and practical considerations based on common sense and fairness should\ndictate which action should proceed first. The implication was that simultaneous\nproceedings in two jurisdictions did not necessarily mean that a\nstay would be granted as of right. The decision for a stay application must\nfundamentally depend on whether it is fair to the parties. Thus\nthe parties’ conduct was important. The conduct of Boxsentry and\nEleven 33     I\nagreed with Eleven that to grant the stay would be to condone Boxsentry’s\nintention to prolong and drag the proceedings. Boxsentry’s sole intention\nwas to deny Eleven of the payments sought by abusing the court’s procedural\nrules. The stay was sought by Boxsentry in order to defer its payment\nobligation to Eleven for as long as it could. Such conduct was unacceptable.\nI shall now trace the chronology of events to support my finding. (I)   Boxsentry failed\nto make the third quarter payment 34     The\nparties entered into the PA on 27 November 2007. The first and second\nquarter payments for the first year were duly paid for. It was only when\nEleven chased Boxsentry for the third quarter payment of €70,000 that\nthe latter refused to make any payment. This sum was larger than\nthe combined total of the two previous payments. 35     Eleven\nfirst sent Boxsentry the invoice for €70,000 on 6 August 2008. Boxsentry\ndid not respond. Subsequently, after more than two months, Eleven\nsent to Boxsentry on 29 October 2008 a reminder that the third quarter\npayment was due. On 30 October 2008, Boxsentry refused to make payment\nand alleged that the eXpurgate service did not serve its purpose. 36     When\nit became evident that Boxsentry was not going to pay for the third\nand fourth quarter under the PA, Eleven commenced legal action on 19\nFebruary 2009 in Berlin as stipulated under the PA. This was about\nthree months after Boxsentry first indicated that it would not make\nthe third quarter payment on 30 October 2008. (II)   The Berlin proceedings 37     Eleven\ncommenced the Berlin legal proceedings against Boxsentry on 19 February\n2009.[note: 36]It claimed the\nfollowing sums:[note: 37] (a)     €180,000,\nthe sum being the outstanding due from Boxsentry to Eleven under\nthe PA as guaranteed revenue payments for the first year; (b)     interest\nat a rate of 8 percentage points above the base rate from 15 December\n2008; and (c)     costs\nof the Berlin action. The subsequent facts will reveal how Boxsentry had abused\nthe procedural rules of the Berlin and Singapore courts to its own\nadvantage. As a result Boxsentry had insubstanceobtained\na stay from the numerous adjournments and delays which were previously\ngranted to it. (A)   The Berlin’s court\ndocuments were served on Boxsentry in Singapore 38     Boxsentry’s\nregistered business address was in Singapore. The Berlin Regional\nCourt had sent a letter dated 19 May 2009 to the Registrar of the Singapore\nSupreme Court (“the Registrar”). It requested that the Berlin Statement\nof Claim (“the Berlin SOC”) and a judicial order dated 19 March 2009\nissued by the Berlin Regional Court in the Berlin legal proceedings (“the\nBerlin Judicial Order”) be served on Boxsentry in accordance with local\nprocedures.[note: 38]Pursuant\nto this request, the Berlin SOC and the Berlin Judicial Order were\npersonally served on Boxsentry at its registered office on 29 July\n2009 via a process server of the Singapore Supreme Court.[note: 39]The effected service was then\ncommunicated to the Berlin Regional Court via the Embassy of the\nFederal Republic of Germany in Singapore. A Ministry of Foreign\nAffairs letter also confirmed that the said documents had been served\non Boxsentry.[note: 40] 39     A\nperusal of the Berlin Judicial Order showed that if Boxsentry did not\nrespond, the Berlin court was at liberty to enter a default judgment against\nit. The Berlin Judicial Order read as follows: In the event that you fail to have the\nlawyer to be appointed to indicate within the set deadline of four\nweeks your intention of defence against the Claim,the court\nmay – upon request by the Claimant – issue a judgment by default, without\nan oral hearing. In such event, you will have to bear\nthe court fees and all costs necessarily incurred by the adverse\nparty (Sec 91 ZPO). Based on this judgment of default, the Claimant\nis entitled to institute a compulsory execution into your assets,\nwithout having to provide a security (Sec. 708 No. 2 ZPO). The court requested\nthat you reply to the Statement of Claim in writing. This Statement\nof Reply must be received by the court on the last day of the set deadline,\nat the latest, and contain any and all means of defence. In case\nyou miss the deadline for the reply and fail to state an important\nreason for such failure, you are normally barred from fending off\nthe claim, and risk losing this case just because of having missed\nthis deadline. [emphasis added] (B)   The Berlin default\njudgement was issued against Boxsentry 40     Despite\nreceiving the Berlin Judicial Order, Boxsentry failed to enter a defence\nin Berlin. Since it did not do so, the Berlin default judgment was entered\ninto on 27 October 2009. It ordered the following: (a)     Boxsentry\nwas to pay Eleven €180,000 plus interest at a rate of 8 percentage\npoints above the base rate as of 15 February 2008, which amounted\nto €59,229 as at 18 November 2012 and which would continue to accumulate\nuntil the date of full payment.[note: 41] (b)     Boxsentry\nwas to pay €8,561.34 as the costs of the Berlin legal proceedings\nplus interest at the rate of 5 percentage points above the applicable\nbase rate as of 30 April 2010, which amounted to €770.79 as at 18\nNovember 2012 and which would continue to accumulate until the date\nof full payment.[note: 42] (c)     The\nBerlin default judgment was to be provisionally enforceable. From the foregoing, the total claim against Boxsentry was\n€248,561.13 as at 18 November 2012. Boxsentry could object to the\nBerlin default judgment within four weeks from the date of service\nof the Berlin default judgment.. (C)   The Berlin’s default\njudgment was served on Boxsentry in Singapore 41     After\nthe Berlin default judgment was issued, the Berlin Regional Court\nsent a letter to request the Registrar of the Supreme Court of Singapore\nto serve Boxsentry the following documents:[note: 43] (a)     the\nBerlin default judgment; and (b)     the\nNotes of Objection to allow Boxsentry to lodge its objection against\nthe judgment in the “form prescribed by [Singapore] laws”. The Registrar was also requested to send the Certificate of\nService to the Berlin Regional Court.[note: 44] 42     The\nBerlin default judgment together with the Notes of Objection were\nserved personally on Boxsentry on 9 February 2010 and the Berlin Regional\nCourt was informed of this through a letter dated 5 March 2010.[note: 45] 43     As\nan aside, I noted that there was another set of Berlin proceedings commenced\non 1 December 2011 and a second Berlin default judgment was obtained\non 8 October 2012.[note: 46]However,\nthose proceedings were irrelevant to the present action. (D)   Boxsentry failed\nto file an objection to the Berlin default judgment 44     The\nNotes of Objection that were sent to Boxsentry stated that Boxsentry\ncould file an objection to the Berlin default judgment within four weeks\nfrom the date of service of the Berlin default judgment. The objection should\nhave contained its arguments and defences. The Notes further mentioned\nthat if the objection was filed outside the stated timeline, it would\nbe inadmissible and be dismissed. Boxsentry, however, had the right to\napply for an extension of time to file its arguments and defences\nif certain conditions were met. The court would allow for the extension\nprovided that the action would not be delayed or the delay was reasonable.[note: 47]Boxsentry did not file\nany objection to the Berlin default judgment.[note: 48] (III)   Boxsentry repeatedly\nignored Eleven’s requests for payment 45     Boxsentry\ncontinued to ignore the Berlin legal proceedings and the Berlin\ndefault judgment despite being informed. Consequently, Eleven engaged\nSingapore lawyers to issue a letter of demand dated 24 June 2010\nto Boxsentry’s registered office. Boxsentry was requested to make\npayment of the sums due under the Berlin default judgment within\nseven days from the date of the letter.[note: 49]The letter of\ndemand had a translated copy of the Berlin default judgment. Boxsentry\nfailed to respond to the letter of demand. When Eleven’s Singapore\nsolicitors sent a second letter of demand dated 20 July 2010 to\nBoxsentry’s registered office, this was again to no avail. (IV)   Boxsentry sought\nrepeated adjournments in the Singapore proceedings 46     When\nEleven commenced legal proceedings in Singapore, Boxsentry sought\nto delay the matter. It applied for numerous adjournments for various\nreasons, including (a) that the court should wait for developments in\nthe Berlin courts; and (b) that they were exploring the possibility\nof a settlement. The appeal against the AR’s decisions was first\nfixed for hearing on 17 October 2013. Parties sought an adjournment\nto settle the matter. This was granted. Thereafter, several adjournments\nwere granted for parties to attempt to settle the matter. 47     Eventually,\nthe case came before me again on 22 April 2014. Boxsentry sought\nan adjournment to await the outcome of its action to set aside the\nBerlin default judgment. Eleven objected to the adjournment but since\nthe Berlin court would release its decision on 13 May 2014, I allowed the\nmatter to be adjourned. As matters transpired, Boxsentry lost its\ncase in Berlin. 48     After\nBoxsentry had lost its case in Berlin, I heard the matter fully\non 22 August 2014. I was not prepared to adjourn this case further\npending the outcome of the Boxsentry’s appeal to the Supreme Court\nof Berlin. Therefore, Boxsentry hadin substanceobtained\na partial stay of about ten months. I was of the firm view that\nthe matter should not be delayed any further. My observations regarding Boxsentry’s\nconduct 49     Boxsentry\nhad thus calculated its strategy to delay the enforcement of the\nthird and fourth quarter payments. Additionally, I also find that\nit had been nonchalant, that it had brought the stay application\nin bad faith and its allegation against Eleven was a sham. (I)   Boxsentry was nonchalant 50     Boxsentry’s\nattitude towards Eleven’s efforts to seek redress through legal\nproceedings in Singapore and Germany was nonchalant. The narration\nof the events above clearly revealed that Boxsentry had been properly\nserved with the Berlin SOC, which contained a notice for it to attend\nthe Berlin proceedings. It chose not to do so and failed to enter\nan appearance in Berlin. When Boxsentry was notified of the Berlin\ndefault judgment, again it chose not to exercise its right to object\ndespite being informed about its right to do so. Every due process\nto defend itself was accorded to Boxsentry. 51     When\nthe two letters of demand were subsequently sent out by Eleven’s\nsolicitors, Boxsentry chose not to reply. It was only when Eleven took\nout legal proceedings to enforce the Berlin default judgment in Singapore\nthat Boxsentry suddenly sprang into action. It contested the present\nproceedings. Boxsentry filed an appeal in Berlin to restrain the enforcement\nof both the Berlin default judgments in Singapore and to set aside\nboth the Berlin default judgments. The last minute actions of Boxsentry\nindicated its tactics to effect a delay when it was faced with a\nreal threat that it would be compelled to pay Eleven the sums sought.\nSuch conduct was extremely unbecoming. (II)   Boxsentry’s stay\napplication was brought in bad faith 52     Next,\nI found that Boxsentry had brought the stay application in bad faith.\nThe cases cited by Boxsentry to support its stay application were\nnot of much assistance. The party who sought a stay in those cases\ncould hardly be described as dilatory. In the present case, the\nresistance started from the time when Eleven sought payment from\nBoxsentry for the third quarter payment on 6 August 2008 and Boxsentry\nignored that invoice. Since then, it had been refusing and challenging\npayments due to Eleven for the last six years. 53     Boxsentry’s\nconduct clearly revealed an intention to deprive Eleven of its legal\nrights. Its actions were calculated to deny Eleven of its third\nand fourth quarter payments under the PA. Therefore, its application\nwas brought in bad faith. (III)   Boxsentry’s complaint\nthat the eXpurgate service was unusable lacked bona fides 54     Boxsentry\nalso alleged that it had previously raised to Eleven the matter\nregarding the unsuitability of the eXpurgate service. Thereafter, Boxsentry\nterminated the PA. On 20 November 2008 Eleven informed Boxsentry\nvia email that it had no legal basis to rescind the PA. Was Boxsentry’s\nallegation that the eXpurgate service was unfit for its purpose\na genuine and legitimate basis to refuse payment and rescind the\nPA? 55     Prior\nto the signing of the PA on 27 November 2007 Boxsentry tested the\neXpurgate service for free under License No 150727 granted by Eleven. A\ncopy of the graph showing the number of emails scanned and classified (as\nspam or legitimate email) by eXpurgate service showed that Boxsentry started\nusing the eXpurgate service since 16 April 2007. This was approximately\nseven months before the signing of the PA. During this period, Boxsentry\nhad the opportunity to test eXpurgate service without charge. Boxsentry\nmust have been satisfied with eXpurgate service otherwise it would\nnot have signed the PA on 27 November 2007. Moreover, Boxsentry\nmade the first and second quarter payment to Eleven without any\nreservations. Suddenly, when Eleven chased Boxsentry for the third\nquarter payment of €70,000 the latter refused to pay, alleged that eXpurgate\nservice could not be used for the first time and rescinded the PA on\nthe ground of Eleven’s misrepresentation. 56     Moreover,\nBoxsentry later made the first and second quarter payment to Eleven\nwithout any reservations. It was only when Eleven chased Boxsentry\nfor the third quarter payment of €70,000 that the latter refused\nto pay, alleged that eXpurgate service could not be used for the\nfirst time and rescinded the PA on the ground of Eleven’s misrepresentation.\nOn the above facts, the allegation made by Boxsentry appeared to\nbe a sham. Boxsentry’s interests vs Eleven’s\ninterests 57     I\nwas aware of the undesirability of multiple proceedings in multiple jurisdictions\nand the undesirability of each court competing to be the first to\nfind on common facts. However, balancing the interests of Eleven\nand Boxsentry, the former would be greatly prejudiced by any continued\ndelay of the Singapore proceedings which were caused by Boxsentry’s\ncalculated attempts to effect delays. Boxsentry had been given numerous opportunities\nto defend its rights in Germany. It consciously chose to ignore\nthem. When the legal action came to its door step in Singapore,\nit decided to frustrate Eleven through its actions in Berlin. Under\nsuch circumstances, it was clear to me that Eleven’s interests had\nto be preferred and I could not grant a stay application. 58     Subsequent\nto the events above, I noted that the Berlin court had heard Boxsentry’s\napplication to restrain the Singapore proceedings and had dismissed\nits application on 13 May 2014. Boxsentry had filed an appeal on\n13 June 2014 with the Supreme Court of Berlin against the dismissal. 59     Thus\nfar, the Boxsentry’s legal action to stop Eleven’s enforcement of the\njudgment debt has been unsuccessful. The outcome of Boxsentry’s appeal\nin Berlin is still pending, but having regard to the prejudice already suffered\nby Eleven, I took the view that the latest developments in the Berlin proceedings\ncould not justify the grant of a stay.",
        "Inherent jurisdiction": "60     Boxsentry’s\nsecond submission was based on the exercise of my inherent jurisdiction\nto grant a stay. It was made pursuant to O 92 r 4 of the ROC, which\nreads: Inherent powers\nof Court (O. 92, r. 4) (1)    For the avoidance of doubt it is hereby\ndeclared that nothing in these Rules shall be deemed to limit or\naffect the inherent powers of the Court to make any order as may\nbe necessary to prevent injustice or to prevent an abuse of the\nprocess of the Court. 61     I\nwas again of the view that it would be unfair to grant the stay\nunder the court’s inherent jurisdiction. As observed by Asst Prof\nGoh Yihan in his article “The Inherent Jurisdiction and Inherent\nPowers of the Singapore Courts: Rethinking the Limits of their Exercise”\n[2011] SJLS 178 at p 207, the inherent jurisdiction of the court\nis meant to ensure that the court has the proper authority to deal\neffectively with an abuse of its process or the compromise of justice\nthrough written law. This is also the position inHengJoo See v Ho Pol Ling[1993] 2 SLR(R)\n763 where Punch Coomaraswamy J held at [24]–[25] that: 24    Master\nJacob describes the inherent [power] “as being the reserve or fund\nof powers, a residual source of powers, which the court may draw\nupon as necessary whenever it is just or equitable to do so, and\nin particular to ensure the observance of the due process of law,\nto prevent improper vexation or oppression, to do justice between\nthe parties and to secure a fair trial between them”. 25    He classifies cases in which this inherent\npower may be used by the summary powers of the court as falling\ninto these four categories: (a)    proceedings\nwhich involve a deception on the court, or are fictitious or constitute\na mere sham; (b)proceedings where\nthe process of the court is not being fairly or honestly used but\nis employed for some ulterior or improper purpose or in an improper\nway; (c)    proceedings which are manifestly groundless\nor without foundation or which serve no useful purpose; (d)multiple or successive\nproceedings which cause or are likely to cause improper vexation\nor oppression. [emphasis added] 62     In\nmy view, this case fell within the second and fourth categories listed\nby Coomaraswamy J. Exercising my inherent jurisdiction in favour\nof Boxsentry would have meant that I condoned Boxsentry’s lackadaisical conduct.\nAs mentioned at [57] of this judgment, it would further prejudice Eleven,\nwhich had conscientiously complied with the laws of Singapore and Germany\nin claiming against Boxsentry.",
        "Eleven was not dilatory in its\npursue of its claim": "63     Boxsentry\nalleged that Eleven was dilatory in its conduct when it was pursuing\nits claim. This was totally baseless as Eleven had been pursuing\nits claim conscientiously through lawful means. It was Boxsentry\nthat had placed obstacles in Eleven’s way and made it difficult\nfor Eleven to seek legal redress. In fact, it was my view that through\nits actions, Boxsentry hadin effectobtained\na partial stay against Eleven (see [48] above). When I balanced\nthe rights and interests of Boxsentry and Eleven, my finding was that\non the basis of fairness and justice, this appeal against the stay\nof the proceedings had to be dismissed.",
        "The summary judgment application": "64     This\npart of my judgment will deal with the remaining appeal against the\nAR who had granted a summary judgment to Eleven to enforce its Berlin\ndefault judgment. I had also dismissed Boxsentry’s appeal for the reasons\nthat follow.",
        "The AR’s reasons for granting\nsummary judgment to Eleven": "65     The\nAR below agreed to grant Eleven summary judgment on the strength\nof the Berlin default judgment. He accepted the evidence provided by\nDr Klaus that there was proper service of the Berlin SOC, the Berlin Judicial\nOrder, and the Berlin default judgment under German law. The AR was\nalso of the view that the Berlin default judgment was final and conclusive\nbetween the parties.[note: 50] 66     At\nthe hearing below, Boxsentry had raised the fraud exception and sought\nto deny the enforcement of the Berlin default judgment. It alleged that\nthe Berlin default judgment was obtained fraudulently as the eXpurgate service\nwas defective and that fact had not been raised to the Berlin court. This\nwas denied by Eleven. 67     The\nAR held that the allegation was contained in emails which were in Boxsentry’s\npossession when the Berlin legal proceedings were commenced. Boxsentry\ncould have produced them if it had chosen to respond to the Berlin\nlegal proceedings. Therefore the emails did not constitute fresh evidence\nand the fraud exception could not stand.[note: 51]Since Boxsentry\ndid not raise the public policy exception and had also abandoned\nits argument on the breach of natural justice exception, the AR\nheld that the Berlin default judgment was recognisable and enforceable\nat common law. Therefore, he granted Eleven’s application for summary\njudgment.[note: 52]",
        "My decision on the summary judgment\napplication": "87     In\nmy judgment, the Berlin default judgment had not been procured by\nfraud. Therefore, Boxsentry’s appeal must be dismissed. Before giving the\nreasons for my decision, I shall first deal with the burden of proof required\nin an application for summary judgment. The burden of proof for a summary\njudgement 88     The\nparties agreed that the burden of proof was on Eleven to prove on aprima faciebasis before the court would\ngrant it a summary judgment in the enforcement of the foreign judgment.\nBoxsentry only had to show that it had a fair or reasonable chance\nthat there was a real orbona fidedefence:Associated Development Pte Ltd v Loong SieKiong Gerald[2009] 4 SLR(R) 389 at [22].\nThus Boxsentry had to show that there was a triable issue or the need\nfor certain apposite issues to be determined at trial:Tulip Furniture Enterprise Pte Ltd v Roberto Building\nMaterial Pte Ltd[1997] SGHC 114 at [7]. 89     In\nthe context of the enforcement of foreign judgments at common law,\nit is trite law that the foreign judgment must be final and conclusive\non the merits of the case.Hong Pian Teeset\nthis out well at [12]: … [I]t is settled law that a foreign judgmentin personamgiven by a foreign court of\ncompetent jurisdiction may be enforced by an action for the amount due\nunder it so long as the foreign judgment is final and conclusive\nas between the same parties. The foreign judgment is conclusive\nas to any matter thereby adjudicated upon and cannot be impeached\nfor any error, whether of fact or of law:Godard\nv Gray(1870) LR 6 QB 139.In respect\nof such an action, an application for summary judgment may be made\non the ground that the defendant has no defence to the claim:Grant v Easton(1883) 13 QBD 302. The\nlocal court will only refrain from enforcing a foreign judgment\nif it is shown that the plaintiff procured it by fraud, or if its enforcement\nwould be contrary to public policy or if the proceedings in which\nthe judgment was obtained were opposed to natural justice … [emphasis\nadded] Having established the legal position with respect to summary\njudgments in the context of enforcing foreign judgments, I shall\nproceed to examine the appeal brought by Boxsentry and assess whether\nit was meritorious. There was no breach of natural\njustice 90     Boxsentry\nin its written submissions submitted that there was a breach of\nnatural justice if there was no hearing on the merits or improper service\nof the court documents. However, it did not pursue this argument\nat the hearing before me.[note: 75]Nevertheless,\nI found that there was no breach of natural justice as the relevant\nlegal documents had been properly and correctly served on Boxsentry.\nIt was Boxsentry that chose not to respond and sat on its legal\nrights. Therefore that allegation was without merit. The Berlin default judgment\nwas final and conclusive 91     The\nparties’ disagreement as to the final and binding nature of the Berlin\ndefault judgment was more apparent than real. It centred on the\nfact that it was a default judgment which was not granted on the\nmerits of the case. Boxsentry’s position was that because the merits\nof the case were not tried, the judgment was not final and binding\non Boxsentry. Thus it could not be enforced in Singapore (see [69]\nabove). Eleven’s position was that the judgment had fulfilled the\ncriteria as set outBellezzaand\nhence, enforceable (see [79] above). 92     In\nmy view, the Berlin default judgment was final and binding on Boxsentry.\nThe test for finality and conclusiveness was not whether the decision\nwas made on the merits of the case but on whether it could be reopened\nby the court that granted the judgment. Boxsentry’s contention was\nnot supported by the local jurisprudence. Default judgments have\nbeen recognised as final and conclusive, even though the merits\nof the case had not been examined. As commented inHalsbury’s\nLaws of Singaporevol 6(2) (Butterworths Asia, 2013 Reissue)\n(“Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore”)\nat paras 75.157–75.158: The judgment must be final and conclusive\nunder the law of its originating jurisdiction; the judgment must\nberes judicatabetween the parties\nunder that law, ie, it must make a final determination of rights\nbetween the parties. A judgment is not final and conclusive in this\nsense if it can be re-opened by the same tribunal, or if the tribunal\ncan alter its terms, or of there is another body, not being an appellate\nor supervisory body, that can override the decision of the tribunal.\n… … A default judgment\ncan be final and conclusive, even though it may be liable to be\nset aside in the same court, so long as it satisfies the general\ntest of finality. Finality of a default judgment is tested by its\neffect under the law of the originating jurisdiction, so that it\nis necessary to determine the effect of the default judgment under\nthe foreign law. If it has been given the effect of finality\nuntil set aside, it will be regarded as a final and conclusive judgment, but\nif it is subsequently set aside in the foreign jurisdiction, that\ncan be a ground for setting aside a summary judgment made in the\nenforcing forum entirely on the basis of the foreign judgment. … [emphasis added] 93     Eleven’s\nexpert on German law, Dr Klaus, stated that the Berlin default judgment\nwas final and conclusive as to the merits. His view was that under\nss 276 and 331 para 3 of theZivilprozessordnung(“ZPO”),\nthe Berlin Regional Court was able and entitled to issue a default\njudgment without an oral hearing after the time period for Boxsentry\nto file its defence had lapsed.[note: 76]Under s 338\nand 339 of the ZPO, Boxsentry was granted four weeks to object to\nthe Berlin default judgment, during which the Berlin default judgment\nwould only be provisionally enforceable.[note: 77]It failed to\ndo so, and thus, the judgment became final and conclusive which could\nbe enforced.[note: 78] 94     Dr\nCzychowski disagreed on the basis that in Germany, a plaintiff was fraudulent\nif he had pleaded wrong or incomplete facts before the defendant\nhad time to respond.[note: 79]Therefore the\nBerlin default judgment was unenforceable in Germany and should\nnot be enforced in Singapore. 95     In\nmy view, there was no real dispute as to the judgment’s finality.\nDr Klaus and Dr Czychowski both agreed that Berlin default judgment\nwas final and conclusive. The only difference was that Dr Czychowski\nopined that fraud would vitiate enforceability of the judgement.\nIn this case there was no evidence of fraud by Eleven when it obtained\nthe Berlin default judgment. I shall elaborate in greater details\nwhen I deal with the issue of fraud below. Thus this allegation\nalso had no real merit and I was satisfied that the Berlin default\njudgment was final, conclusive and binding on Boxsentry. The Berlin default judgment\nwas not obtained by fraud 96     One\nof the most important issues was whether the Berlin default judgment\nwas obtained by fraud. If there was fraud, the Berlin default judgment\nwould not be enforced nor would it be a suitable case for summary\njudgment. (I)   Fraud and foreign\njudgments 97     The\nissue of fraud for the purposes of resisting the recognition and enforcement\nof foreign judgments was discussed in the Court of Appeal case ofHong Pian Tee. In that case, the Court\nof Appeal departed from the traditional English position inAbouloff v Oppenheimer & Co(1882)\n10 QBD 295 (“Abouloff”) and instead,\nadopted the Canadian-Australian approach laid down inJacobs v Beaver(1908) 17 OLR 496 (“Jacobs”) andKeele\nv Findley(1990) 21 NSWLR 444. As the facts ofHong Pian Teeare similar to the present\ncase, it is helpful to examine them in greater detail. 98     InHong Pian Tee, the respondent had commenced\nan action against the appellant in Canada and the appellant had\nbeen held liable. Later, the respondent sought to enforce the Canadian\njudgment in Singapore and it obtained a summary judgment from Choo\nHan Teck JC (as he then was). Dissatisfied with the outcome, the\nappellant appealed against Choo JC’s decision and the issue on appeal\nwas whether the Canadian judgment was obtained by fraud or not.\nIn dismissing the appeal, Chao Hick Tin JA held that the English\napproach inAbouloffwas undesirable\nin that it encouraged endless litigation (at [27]). He therefore\nrestricted the fraud exception to the following circumstances (at\n[30]): … [W]here an allegation of fraud had been\nconsidered and adjudicated upon by a competent foreign court, the\nforeign judgment may be challenged on the ground of fraud only where\nfresh evidence has come to light which reasonable diligence on the\npart of the defendant would not have uncovered and the fresh evidence\nwould have been likely to make a difference in the eventual result\nof the case. … 99     The\napproach adopted byHong Pian Teedifferentiated\nbetweenextrinsicandintrinsicfraud. If the former was being\nalleged, it would not be subject to the same stringent safeguards\nas the latter, where the claimant must show that the evidence was\n(a) newly discovered in that it could not have been obtained with\nreasonable diligence at trial; and (b) so material that its production\nat the trial would have affected the result: at [19]. 100    The\nparties were at odds as to what constitutesextrinsicandintrinsicfraud. Eleven opined that Boxsentry’s\ncase was built on intrinsic fraud as Boxsentry had submitted that\nEleven had failed to give full and frank disclosure of the background\nfacts of the case to the Berlin court.[note: 80]Having heard\nthe evidence and the law, my finding was that the fraud sought to\nbe raised by Boxsentry appeared to be extrinsic rather than intrinsic. (II)   Boxsentry alleged\nextrinsic fraud and not intrinsic fraud 101    The\nCourt of Appeal inHong Pian Teeat\n[21] discussed intrinsic and extrinsic fraud as held inJacobs. Intrinsic fraud related to fraud\nwhich was “collateral or extraneous, and not merely the fraud which\nis imputed from alleged false statements made at the trial, which\nwere met by counter-statements by the other side, and the whole\nadjudicated upon by the Court and so passed on into the limb of\nestoppel by the judgment” (seeJacobsat 505)\nwhile extrinsic fraud was described as “situations where the judgment went\nagainst the defendant by fraud of the judgment creditor,eg, where the defendant had never been\nserved, or the suit had been undefended without the defendant’s\ndefault, or the defendant had been fraudulently persuaded or deceived\nto allow the judgment to go by default, or some other fraud to the\ndefendant’s prejudice committed or allowed in the proceedings of\nthe foreign court”:Halsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat\npara 75.228.Dicey, Morris & Collins on\nthe Conflict of Laws(Lord Collins of Mapesbury gen ed)\n(Sweet & Maxwell, 15th Ed, 2012) at p 727 further gives examples\nof what is meant by extrinsic fraud: “…whether the fraud is extrinsic,\ne.g., consists in bribing witnesses, or intrinsic, e.g., consists\nin giving or procuring of perjured or forged evidence.” 102    The\nSupreme Court of Canada has also described the distinction as between\nfraud going to the jurisdiction of the court (extrinsic fraud) and fraud\ngoing to the merits of the judgment (intrinsic fraud):Beals v Saldanha[2003] 3 SCR 416 (“Beals”) at [51]. In its view: 51    It\nis simpler to say that fraud going to jurisdiction can always be\nraised before a domestic court to challenge the judgment. On the\nother hand, the merits of a foreign judgment can be challenged for\nfraud only where the allegations are new and not the subject of\nprior adjudication. Where material facts not previously discoverable\narise that potentially challenge the evidence that was before the\nforeign court, the domestic court can decline recognition of the\njudgment. 103    It\nis therefore evident that the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic\nfraud has been drawn along the lines of whether the fraud took place\nwithin or outside the trial. This distinction can be attributed\nto the history of English legal development. Traditionally, common\nlaw courts would only treat a judgment as void for fraud based on\ncollusion and other extrinsic fraud, ignoring the evidence given\nat trial. The courts of equity however were more willing to examine\nwhether judgments were obtained by false evidence: D M Gordon, “Fraud\nor New Evidence as Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–I”\n(1961) 77 LQR 358 at p 366 and D M Gordon, “Fraud or New Evidence\nas Grounds for Actions to Set Aside Judgments–II” (1961) 77 LQR\n533 (“Fraud or New Evidence II”) at p 533. The following passage\nfrom Fraud or New Evidence II at p 555 provides a good analysis\nas to the practical differences between alleging extrinsic and intrinsic\nfraud: One important factor in fraud actions is\nwhether the fraud set up is extrinsic, or is false evidence that\nproduced the judgment. In all cases, the plaintiff must begin by\nproducing his new evidence, and by showing that this is newly-discovered\nand not discoverable before by exercise of diligence. Unless this new\nevidence is strong and convincing, the court may dismiss the action\nat once. … In a case of extrinsic fraud, such asbribery of a solicitor, counsel or witnesses, or\ncollusion with a representative party to the prejudice of beneficial\ninterests, even though the principle is accepted that\nfraud to be remediable must be shown to have brought about the judgment\nattacked, the court may well dispose of the case on a hearing in\nwhich the fact of the fraud is the only point tried, and on making\na finding of fraud the court goes no further, but reverses the judgment\nattacked. In such an event, the court restores the parties to their original\npositions before the first judgment, without prejudice to the right\nof the loser to try for another judgment in a fresh action, if he\nsees fit. This means that the court presumes that the fraud proved\ncontributed to the judgment reversed; in most cases of extrinsic\nfraud it would be impossible to trace the connecting links between\nthe fraud and the judgment following, even if the same judge sat\nwithout a jury in both trials. But this course could rarely, if ever,\nbe appropriate in a review based on intrinsic fraud, and particularly\nperjury. As James LJ has pointed out, in most contested actions\na certain amount of perjury goes on, perhaps on both sides, the\njudge knowing that some person or persons must be lying; and because on\nreview some particular piece of evidence on the first trial appears\nto have been false, it does not follow that the judgment should\nbe presumed to have been produced by it. So in general review calls\nfor a hearing in which both the old and the new evidence is weighed\ntogether. [emphasis added] 104    In\nmy view, Boxsentry’s fraud allegation was premised on Eleven’s failure\nto give full and frank disclosure of the background facts to the\nBerlin Regional Court. This was purportedly done so that the Berlin\ndefault judgment could be obtained unfairly against Boxsentry. It\nappeared to be an allegation of extrinsic fraud and not intrinsic\nfraud since it was an allegation that Eleven fraudulently sought\nto mislead the Berlin court. (III)   There was no extrinsic\nfraud on the facts 105    I\nfound that there was no extrinsic fraud. There was nothing to suggest\nthat Eleven had sought to deceive the Berlin courts. The evidence showed\nthat Eleven had stated in the Berlin SOC that Boxsentry had made allegations\nregarding the eXpurgate service.[note: 81]Eleven had annexed to\nthe Berlin SOC its email dated 20 November 2008 to Boxsentry and\nthe latter’s email to Eleven dated 15 December 2008. Those emails\nrelated to the termination of the PA and Boxsentry dissatisfaction\nof eXpurgate service. If Eleven had the intention to deceive the\nBerlin Regional Court, what was the point of saying that and hurting\nits own chances of succeeding in the German action? Eleven mentioned\nthose facts as it was honest with the Berlin court. I thus hold\nthat the allegation of extrinsic fraud made by Boxsentry was without\nmerit. 106    I\nnoted as well that in the Berlin Regional Court’s decision rendered on\n13 May 2014, the court had held that Eleven had disclosed all the\nfacts relating to the allegations of the eXpurgate service being\ndefective. Therefore its allegation that the Berlin default judgment\nwas procured by fraud was groundless. The Berlin court had also\nfound that there were no circumstances which would lead to the enforcement\nof the Berlin default judgment being contrary to public policy.\nThus I found that the present proceedings were merely desperate\nand weak attempts to set aside a valid and legitimate judgment. (IV)   There was no intrinsic\nfraud on the facts 107    I\nearlier held at [100] that the fraud raised by Boxsentry was in\nfact extrinsic fraud. But if it was intrinsic fraud, Boxsentry would\nhave needed to show me that new evidence had surfaced since the\nBerlin default judgment. I noted that inBeals,\nthe Supreme Court of Canada had held that: 53    AlthoughJacobs, supra, was a contested foreign\naction, the test used is equally applicable to default judgments.Where the foreign default proceedings are not inherently\nunfair, failing to defend the action, by itself, should prohibit the\ndefendant from claiming that any of the evidence adduced or steps\ntaken in the foreign proceedings was evidence of fraud just discovered.\nBut if there is evidence of fraud before the foreign court that\ncould not have been discovered by reasonable diligence, that will\njustify a domestic court’s refusal to enforce the judgment.\n[emphasis added] 108    Fraud\nor New Evidence II at p 538 also commented that: Perjury at a trial could in a sense be\ncalled intrinsic fraud, and perhaps other perjury, as in giving\ndiscovery, could be called extrinsic. But it seems more than doubtful\nwhether any such distinctions have value. What the reviewing court\nis concerned with are the questions:How strong\nis the probability that such perjury produced the judgment given?\nHow strong is the probability that the evidence of perjury will\nconvince the second court?[emphasis added] 109    I\nwas unconvinced that new evidence had surfaced. The new evidence sought\nto be relied upon was a brochure produced by Eleven. The brochure claimed\nthat it was technically impossible to be 100% accurate in categorising\nspam. That was allegedly contrary to what Eleven had said in its\ncontractual negotiations with Boxsentry.[note: 82]The\nlatter also claimed that it could not obtain the brochure with “reasonable\ndiligence” prior to the present action. I found that hard to believe.\nIf it was a brochure, it would have been made easily available by\nEleven to the world since it would have been used by Eleven for\nmarketing purposes. The merits of the substantive\naction were irrelevant 110    Lastly,\nI found that Boxsentry’s submission that there were complex and\nconflicting facts to be decided was irrelevant to the grant of summary judgment.\nThe case before me was not one on the merits, but one for the enforcement\nof a foreign decision. The parties had agreed in the PA to the exclusive\njurisdiction of the Berlin courts and the application of German law\nto govern the PA (at [10] above). As such, the presence of complex\nand conflicting facts was not an issue to be determined by the Singapore\ncourt and I had no intention to usurp the position of the Berlin\ncourts in determining factual issues such as the quality of the\neXpurgate service.",
        "Conclusion": "111    In\nconclusion, I was of the view that RA 292 and RA 293 were unmeritorious.\nAccordingly, I dismissed both the appeals and ordered Boxsentry\nto pay Eleven the following: (a)     fixed\ncosts of $5,000 for both appeals; (b)     $1,000\nfor the adjournment; and (c)     reasonable\ndisbursements. 112    I\nfurther ordered Boxsentry to pay fixed costs of $5,000 for both\nRAs plus reasonable disbursements.
