        "The contract": "4. The contract was not the normal contract for sale of goods. Although\n\nit started by stating that the plaintiff had agreed to sell and the defendant had agreed\n\nto buy what was described as the ‘THYSSEN HUNNEBECK FORMWORK SYSTEM for Refurbished\n\nKST Table Form and Refurbished Manto Column Form’, and set out the lump sum price\n\npayable for the same (S$3,000,000 plus GST) it then contained a buy back guarantee. This\n\nread as follows:‘1.2 BUY BACK PRICEThe Buyer [the defendant] guarantees to sell-back and the Seller [the\n\n    plaintiff] agrees to buy-back 40% of all standard sale equipment from the Buyer as\n\n    follows:Lump Sum Sales PriceS$3,000,000.00Less Plywood Sales PriceS$   300,000.00Value of Standard EquipmentS$2,700,000.00Value of Buy-Back @40%S$1,080,000.00Value of Equipment after buy backS$1,620,000.00Add in PlywoodS$   300,000.00Buyer paysS$1,920,000.00*This Buy-back Price will be subject to variation due to lost or\n\n    damaged equipment. The Seller will be entitled to compensation for the cost of lost\n\n    equipment as per Appendix B, C, & D (refer to Buy-Back Terms & Conditions Appendix\n\n    A).’It should also be noted that under clause 6, payment for the formwork\n\nhad to be made upon delivery of the same and that the amount of the payment was the net\n\nvalue after deduction of the buy-back price. Thus, in the first instance, the plaintiff\n\nwould receive only the ultimate price of $1,920,000 and not the original lump sum price of\n\n$3,000,000.5. Under clause 2 of the contract, the parties agreed on the area of\n\nformwork to be delivered in respect of each type to be supplied. The plaintiff also agreed\n\nunder clause 2.3 to supply the defendant with additional formwork on loan without rental\n\ncharges in the event that acceleration of the project was required provided that the\n\ndefendant gave the plaintiff four weeks advance written notice. It was specifically\n\nprovided that if loan equipment was lost, the plaintiff would be compensated for the lost\n\nof the equipment in the manner set out in Appendices B, C and D of the contract.6. There were also clauses in the contract relating to the fabrication\n\nof the formwork. Under clause 3 the plaintiff was obliged to provide the defendant with\n\nall necessary shop drawings for the first application of the materials related to the\n\nsystem formwork. It had also to provide two site supervisors at the project site for a\n\nperiod of six months for the purpose of assembly, erection and operation of the system\n\nformwork. Under clause 9 it was specified that the defendant was to provide adequate\n\nlabourers/site personnel who were to liase closely with the plaintiff’s site\n\nsupervisor during the fabrication, erection and dismantling of the formwork on site.",
        "Parties’ contentions": "7. In the first affidavit filed on behalf of the plaintiff in support\n\nof its order 14 application, its general manager, Mr Prins, dealt briefly with the claim\n\nfor lost formwork. He pointed out that under clause 1.2 of the contract, the plaintiff was\n\nentitled to compensation for the cost of lost formwork as set out in the Appendices to the\n\ncontract. He went on to assert that the plaintiff was entitled to compensation of\n\n$339,460.19 (inclusive of GST) for the cost of lost formwork and referred to a schedule\n\nannexed to his affidavit. This schedule was a document prepared by the plaintiff which\n\ncontained very brief details of the type of formwork lost together with the cost of the\n\nsame. Nine types of formwork were specified but there were no details of the number of\n\nindividual pieces lost nor the total area of the lost pieces.8. In  22 and  23 of its defence and counterclaim, the defendant\n\nhad asserted that under the terms of the contract, the plaintiff was obliged to fabricate\n\nthe formwork and/or supply the formwork in pre-assembled form ready for use by the\n\ndefendant. In breach of such obligation, the plaintiff failed to fabricate the formwork\n\nand/or supply it in pre-assembled form. Due to the plaintiff’s said breach of\n\ncontract, many of the materials and items supplied had to be cut and consumed in the\n\nfabrication and assembly undertaken by the defendant. Accordingly, the quantities of the\n\nmaterials returned could not tally with the quantities supplied. The defendant asserted\n\nthat the non-return of formwork was therefore due to the plaintiff’s own breach of\n\ncontract and the plaintiff’s claim was not maintainable. This assertion was\n\nreiterated in the affidavit filed by Mr Teo Hock Chwee, the defendant’s managing\n\ndirector, in the order 14 proceedings.9. Mr Prins replied to Mr Teo’s affidavit. He disputed the\n\nassertion that the plaintiff had any obligation to fabricate the formwork and/or supply it\n\nin pre-assembled form as alleged. He said that it was not possible to pre-assemble the\n\nformwork and then take it to the construction site because of the sheer size of the\n\nformwork. There was, in fact, a designated area within the construction site for\n\nfabrication of the formwork. Mr Prins pointed out that under clause 3 of the contract, the\n\nplaintiff’s obligation was to provide two site supervisors to supervise the assembly,\n\nerection and operation of the formwork on site. He also said that although the plaintiff\n\ngave the defendant a quotation of $2,100,000 (sale price less buy-back price) for the\n\nsupply of formwork, the defendant had itself given a much higher quotation for formwork to\n\nthe main contractor. The amount quoted by the defendant was $8,851,229. Mr Prins claimed\n\nthat the higher quotation showed that the defendant knew full well from the onset that it\n\nwas the defendant’s obligation to fabricate the formwork.10. In a further affidavit, Mr Prins elaborated on his assertion that\n\nit was impossible to pre-assemble the formwork. He stated in paragraphs 9 and 10 of his\n\nthird affidavit that:‘9. … Due to the height of the tables required, the KST Table\n\n  Form used on this project was of the fixed leg type (as opposed to folding leg type). The\n\n  pre-assembled KST Table Forms are several storeys high, as can be seen from the\n\n  photographs annexed hereto and exhibited as ‘MFP-17’. It would not be\n\n  possible to transport these to the construction site and the formwork has to be\n\n  pre-fabricated on site in the configuration required, which would normally consist of six\n\n  (6) legs along with KST heads and a flat table fixed to the top.10. For the record, it should be noted that in many formwork systems\n\n  such as the plaintiff’s Manto column forms, the moulds for the concrete are assembled\n\n  before each separate casting. The speciality of the plaintiff’s KST Table Form System\n\n  is that the table is pre-assembled out of a mixture of steel and timber components to form\n\n  the finished table shape. These pre-assembled tables are then joined together to form the\n\n  support of the slab table to be cast. After casting of the concrete slab, the tables are\n\n  then separated and moved to the next casting area, and they are continuously used in their\n\n  pre-assembled form.’",
        "Reasons": "11. I accepted the plaintiff’s submission that the defendant had\n\nno ground on which to assert that the plaintiff had to pre-assemble the formwork before\n\ndelivering it to the site. The photographs annexed to Mr Prins’ affidavit showed the\n\nmassive nature of the formwork once assembled. The parties could not have contemplated any\n\npre-assembly of this formwork. The plaintiff’s obligation was to supply the\n\ncomponents of its formwork system and the defendant then had to assemble these components\n\ninto the structures required for the construction of the project. That this was so was\n\nmade quite clear by the contract which obliged the defendant to provide sufficient labour\n\nfor the assembly and also required the plaintiff to have two supervisors on site for a\n\nperiod of six months. If the assembly was to take place prior to delivery there would have\n\nbeen no need for the plaintiff’s supervisors to go to the site at all let alone for\n\nsuch a long period.12. It was also provided in the contract that the defendant was to be\n\nresponsible for the maintenance of the equipment during the construction period and to\n\nkeep it in good working condition. On completion of the project, the defendant was\n\nresponsible for the dismantling and rounding up of all the parts and bringing them back to\n\nstreet level. These provisions of the contract were also contrary to the defendant’s\n\nsubmission about pre-assembly. If the defendant had nothing to do with the assembly of the\n\nformwork and it could be delivered in pre-assembled condition, it did not need to have any\n\nresponsibility for dismantling since such pre-assembled formwork could also be redelivered\n\nin the same condition.13. The defendant had admitted that it had, in putting pieces of the\n\nformwork together for the purposes of the project, cut and consumed parts of the formwork\n\nin this fabrication and assembly work. It had further admitted that accordingly the\n\nquantities of the materials returned could not tally with the quantities supplied. The\n\ndefendant was the purchaser of the formwork. If it wanted to rely on the resale provisions\n\nin the contract, it had to be able to redeliver what it had purchased originally. It could\n\nnot do so. It was contemplated in the contract that it might not be able to do so and the\n\ndefendant agreed that in that event it would pay for those parts of the formwork that it\n\ncould not redeliver.14. In my opinion, the defendant had no defence in principle to the\n\nplaintiff’s claim for the cost of formwork that was not redelivered and thus resold\n\nto the plaintiff. The only reason why I gave interlocutory judgment to the plaintiff was\n\nthat the plaintiff had not sufficiently proved the calculation of its loss at $339,460.19.\n\nI considered that it should at an assessment hearing produce the delivery orders and the\n\nredelivery orders respectively and then quantify the number and type of pieces of formwork\n\nwhich had not been redelivered so that the court and the parties could calculate the\n\namount due in respect of each of the lost pieces. The defendant would then also have the\n\nopportunity of challenging the plaintiff’s calculations and/or documents to show that\n\nmore pieces had been returned than the plaintiff had given credit for.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGEThis does not merit reporting.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
