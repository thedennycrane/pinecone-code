        "The LKTH and LKTI shares": "15. The husband explained how he came to own these shares. Before his\n\nmarriage he received shares in three companies, namely Lee Realty Pte Ltd, Lee Development\n\nPte Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Pte Ltd as gifts from members of his family.16. In 1982 the three companies were part of an amalgamation exercise\n\nto consolidate the companies into a holding company, LKTH. He deposed that \"I was\n\noffered the shares in Lee Kim Tah Holdings Ltd and Lee Kim Tah Investments Pte Ltd in\n\nconsideration of the shares which I held earlier.\" He was married by this time.17. The husband argued that the LKTH and LKTI shares are not\n\nmatrimonial assets under s 112(10), but I disagreed with him. The gift shares in the\n\noriginal companies were no longer in existence at the time of division. He had accepted\n\nthe offer to exchange them for new shares. The new shares did not come from the donors and\n\nwere not gifts received in the course of amalgamation.The SingTel shares18. The husband did not dispute that he held 720 SingTel (A) shares and\n\n600 SingTel (B) shares. He wanted to exclude them from division because \"… these\n\nshares were not acquisitions and the Petitioner herself has the same number of\n\nshares.\"19. He did not explain how he came by those shares, and cannot expect\n\nanyone to act on his bare assertion. The fact that the wife also held SingTel shares does\n\nnot mean that his shares are not matrimonial assets. It may mean that her SingTel shares\n\nshould also be considered for division, but that is another matter, and that is not a\n\nmatter under appeal before me.The Singapore Island Country Club (\"SICC\") and American Club\n\nmemberships20. The husband claimed that they were given to him by his father. In\n\nrespect of the SICC membership, it was submitted thatThis was a gift from the Respondent’s parents. When the membership\n\n  was made transferable, in January 1992, the Respondent made an upfront payment of\n\n  $14,000.00 and paid the balance in instalments of $500.00 monthly from 1stJuly\n\n  1992 to 1stJune 1998.21. The husband did not get his father to confirm the gifts, or obtain\n\nconfirmation from the clubs as he did in respect of the gift of a British Club membership.\n\nI found that he had not proved them to my satisfaction. Even if there was a gift of the\n\nSICC membership, it was a gift of a non-transferrable membership with no realisable value.\n\nThe present membership is a transferable membership. Assuming that it originated from a\n\ngift, it is no longer that membership after it was converted at a cost of $50,000.The bank accounts22. Three accounts are in the husband’s sole name. One account\n\nwith OCBC is held with his father and another with POSB is held with his mother.23. The husband’s submissions dealt with these accounts in two\n\nsentences - \"There is no available cash for division. The Petitioner has more cash\n\nthan the Respondent.\" I cannot understand that. The accounts are in credit. Whether\n\nor not the wife has more cash has no bearing on the issue. Her cash holdings may be\n\nsubject to division, but that is not a matter before me on the appeal.24. He also claimed that he was holding the account with his mother as\n\nher trustee. This was a bare assertion with no documentary evidence, no explanation to the\n\npurpose and terms of the trust, and no affidavit by the mother to confirm her beneficial\n\ninterest.25. In the circumstances, I ruled that the sums in the three accounts\n\nin the husband’s name and half the funds in each of the accounts he held with his\n\nparents are matrimonial assets.The CPF funds26. The husband’s position before the district judge was that the\n\nwife should not be entitled to more than 20% of his CPF funds. In his appeal from the\n\ndistrict judge’s decision, the husband accepted the 25% apportionment but contended\n\nthat it should be computed on the net value. I have dealt with this net/gross issue in\n\nparagraph 12(ii).Valuation of the assets27. I ordered that the values of the matrimonial assets on which there\n\nwas no agreed values to be assessed by the Registrar. I also ordered that the values be\n\ntaken as at 7 May 1999 – the day when the district judge ordered the division. With\n\nregard to the shares in two Malaysian counters United Engineers and Faber Merlin which\n\ncannot be transacted currently, I ordered that their values be set at the time they can be\n\ndisposed of.The maintenance for the wife28. The district judge had ordered that she is to receive a lump sum of\n\n$960,000 computed at $8000 per month for 10 years. Both parties agreed that there should\n\nbe a lump-sum amount pegged at 10 years. The wife had asked it to be computed on $14,000\n\nper month, and the husband offered $4000.29. In coming to his figure of $8000 the district judge took into\n\naccount the fact that it was common ground between the parties that the wife had enjoyed a\n\nvery high standard of living and a good quality of life during the marriage.30. Prior to the hearing before him, the parties had an arrangement\n\nwhereby the husband paid to the wife $5000 for the maintenance of her and the daughter. He\n\nalso paid $3000 per month for the rental of the house the wife and daughter were staying\n\nin, and $3090 towards the payment of the wife’s car. This arrangement is a reflection\n\nof the parties’ expectations and abilities with regard to maintenance. The award\n\nbased on $8000 a month is reasonable.Maintenance for the daughter31. There was no appeal against this order in the husband’s notice\n\nof appeal. Nevertheless his counsel submitted on it before me.32. Since it was brought up, I will comment on it, although I do not\n\nregard it as a matter under appeal.33. In fixing the maintenance at $3000, the district judge found that\n\nto be adequate maintenance. He was not obliged to set out the components to that figure,\n\nand he did not. His finding that the wife and the family had enjoyed a very good quality\n\nof life must have contributed to his decision, and he must have considered the wife’s\n\nbreak-down of the $3400 that she claimed as well as the husband’s basis for offering\n\n$2000.34. On the available material, I would not say that the district\n\njudge’s award of $3000 was wrong. I may have come to a lower figure if the matter\n\ncame before me at the first instance, but the difference would not merit disturbing the\n\norder even if there was an appeal.The costs below35. The district judge awarded costs to the wife for the hearing of the\n\nancillary matters fixed at $12,000. No costs were awarded on the petition, which was\n\ngrounded on separation and was not contested There can be two bases for the husband’s\n\nobjection to the order – on principle and on quantum.36. His complaint is that costs should not be ordered because the\n\ndivorce proceeded on a no-fault basis, citing in supportShi Fang v Koh Pee Huat[1996] 2 SLR 221where the Court of Appeal said at pp 237-8The wife obtained a decree nisi on the ground that the marriage had\n\n  irretrievably broken down owing to desertion on the part of the husband. Implicit in the\n\n  grant of such decree to the wife was the finding of fault on the part of the husband as a\n\n  cause for the divorce. In granting the decree nisi the court ordered, inter alia, that\n\n  costs be adjourned for further hearing. We can find no reason why the wife should not be\n\n  allowed the full costs of the hearing of the petition. As the hearing of the ancillary\n\n  matters was a continuation or part of the hearing of the divorce petition, the wife should\n\n  be entitled to the costs of such hearing also. The wife was awarded $240,000 as a lump sum\n\n  maintenance and $10,000 as her share of the matrimonial assets. We cannot see any reason\n\n  for depriving the wife of her costs of the hearing of the ancillaries. In our judgment,\n\n  she should be entitled to full costs of the hearing of the petition and the ancillaries\n\n  below, and we so order.37. This is not really relevant or helpful to the husband’s cause.\n\nThe Court held that the petitioner was entitled to the costs of the divorce hearing and\n\nthe hearing of the ancillary matters in a fault-based divorce. I do not read that to imply\n\nthat where a divorce proceeded on fault-free basis, costs should not be awarded for the\n\nancillary matters.38. In the usual case where marriage is dissolved on a fault-free\n\nground no costs are awarded. This is especially so when the petition is not contested. If\n\nit is contested, costs may be awarded if the respondent acts unreasonably, e.g. by\n\nunreasonably disputing the separation or the breakdown of the marriage.39. However it does not follow that costs would not be awarded in\n\nancillary applications in fault-free uncontested proceedings in all cases. It really\n\ndepends on the conduct of the parties. If one party’s unreasonable conduct led to a\n\nlong hearing of ancillary matters, there is no reason why that party could not be ordered\n\nto pay costs. InGrenfell v Grenfell[1978] 1 All ER 560 Ormrod LJ said at 568(I)f the court dissolves a marriage on the ground of five years’\n\n  separation, it should not, in the ordinary way, grant costs to either side, the object\n\n  being to prevent parties insisting on the court conducting an enquiry as to why they have\n\n  been living apart for five years; in other words, having a contested suit simply for the\n\n  purpose of deciding who should pay the costs.So far as ancillary relief is concerned, it seems to me thatthe\n\n  costs in any proceedings for ancillary relief must depend on the way in which those\n\n  proceedings are conducted on both sides, and the judge must exercise his discretion in\n\n  the ordinary way, bearing in mind perhaps that it is a five year separation case, but\n\n  certainly not regarding himself as bound to make no order as to costs because the ground\n\n  for decree was a five year separation. The matter must be dealt with, it seems to me, in a\n\n  reasonable way in the light of the facts of any particular case.(Emphasis added)40. In a hearing on ancillary matters, it is for the judge hearing them\n\nto decide whether costs should be awarded. The Court of Appeal ruled inTham Khai Meng\n\nv Nam Wen Jet Bernadette[1997] 2 SLR 27at p 47 that(T)he hearing of the ancillaries is part of or a continuation of the\n\n  hearing of the petition. It therefore follows that where a party, whether petitioner or\n\n  respondent, is awarded costs at the hearing of the petition, the same order as to costs\n\n  should follow at the hearing of the ancillaries,unless the party to whom the costs\n\n  were awarded at the hearing of the petition has acted unreasonably at the hearing of the\n\n  ancillariesor for other good reasons.(Emphasis added)41. Thus a party awarded costs for the hearing of the petition may not\n\nget the costs for the hearing of the ancillary matters if it acted unreasonably. This can\n\nbe taken further. In an appropriate case a court may even find a party’s conduct in\n\nrespect to the ancillary matters so unreasonable that costs be awarded against that party\n\nalthough it was awarded costs on the divorce proper. To illustrate the point, a petitioner\n\nproceeds on the ground of adultery. The respondent does not contest the petition, and\n\ncosts therein are awarded to the petitioner. On the ancillary matters, the petitioner\n\nmakes unjustified and unacceptable claims and demands on the matrimonial assets,\n\nmaintenance and care and custody of the children of the marriage and rejects reasonable\n\nproposals from the respondent on these matters. In such a situation, costs for the hearing\n\nof the ancillary matters may well be ordered against the petitioner.42. The district judge had exercised his discretion to award costs for\n\nthe ancillary applications to the wife, and had fixed costs at $12,000, taking into\n\naccount the fact that the hearings took 2 days and the complexity in computation. I did\n\nnot think that the order was wrong in principle or excessive in amount, and I affirmed the\n\norder.Costs of the appeal43. Neither party has succeeded in getting what it wanted from the\n\nappeals. The wife did not obtain the revision of the share of the matrimonial assets she\n\nwanted, and the husband did not get the reduction of the wife’s maintenance and the\n\nrescission of the order for costs. Looking at the matters as a whole, I ordered that each\n\nparty bears its own costs in the appeal.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
