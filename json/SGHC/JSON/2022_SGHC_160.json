        "Facts": "4 The accused was 21 years old at the time of the offence.2Foot Note 2×Statement of Facts (“SOF”) at para 1.He and two other involved persons were arrested on 27 September 2018 at about 8.25pm in the vicinity of a coffeeshop located at 21 Kian Teck Road, Singapore.3Foot Note 3×SOF at para 3.The three of them had been in a green car bearing licence plate number SGU 3327U (the “Green Car”).4Foot Note 4×SOF at para 4(b).When officers from the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) searched the Green Car, they found, amongst other things, 23 blocks and 5 packets of vegetable matter.5Foot Note 5×SOF at para 5.These were subsequently analysed by the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) and found to contain,inter alia, not less than 499.99g of cannabis.6Foot Note 6×SOF at para 10. 5 A total of five individuals were involved in the transactions that led to the accused’s arrest.  These individuals were the accused, one Thomas Henrix Mathewson (“Thomas”), one Dean Fadriel Mohamed Rizal (“Dean”), one Muhammad Zulhusni bin Abdul Ghani (“Zulhusni”) and one Kumaran s/o Kannan (“Kumaran”) (collectively, the “involved persons”).7Foot Note 7×SOF at para 2.",
        "The Tampines transaction": "6 Sometime in the morning on 27 September 2018, the accused met up with Thomas and Dean at Veerasamy Road, Singapore.  At around the same time, arrangements were made for Zulhusni to drive the group around in a rented car.  Zulhusni agreed to the arrangement in exchange for being allowed to use the rented car for the weekend.8Foot Note 8×SOF at para 11.Subsequently, Kumaran met Zulhusni and brought the latter to rent the Green Car in Zulhusni’s name.  Kumaran paid the rental fee.9Foot Note 9×SOF at para 12. 7 At about 4.00pm that same day, the accused, Thomas and Dean took a Grab taxi to Bedok Mall.  Zulhusni drove the Green Car, with Kumaran accompanying him, to Bedok Mall.  There, all five involved persons met and boarded the Green Car.10Foot Note 10×SOF at para 13. 8 Later that day, at about 6.30pm, the involved persons drove to Block 299B, Tampines Street 22, Singapore (the “Tampines Block”).  At about 6.33pm, Kumaran went up the Tampines Block via the staircase.  Five minutes later, at about 6.38pm, the accused went up the Tampines Block via the staircase.  There, the accused collected a large blue recycling bag.  The large blue recycling bag contained two blue cooler bags.  The accused placed the large blue recycling bag in the boot of the Green Car with Dean’s assistance.  Shortly after that, Kumaran returned from the Tampines Block to the Green Car.11Foot Note 11×SOF at para 14.All five involved persons then entered the Green Car and left the vicinity of the Tampines Block.  Kumaran and Dean alighted somewhere in the vicinity of Tampines.12Foot Note 12×SOF at para 15.",
        "The Lok Yang Road transaction and arrest": "9 After Kumaran and Dean had been dropped off, Zulhusni drove the accused and Thomas to Lok Yang Road in the Green Car.13Foot Note 13×SOF at para 16.While in that vicinity, at about 8.20pm, the accused received an off-white plastic bag from an unknown rider of a motorcycle bearing a Malaysian licence place.  The off-white plastic bag contained,inter alia, nine blocks of vegetable matter, later ascertained to be cannabis.14Foot Note 14×SOF at para 18.The accused placed the off-white plastic bag containing the nine blocks of cannabis in the boot of the Green Car.15Foot Note 15×SOF at para 19. 10 Zulhusni then drove the Green Car to a coffeeshop at 21 Kian Teck Road.  Upon arrival, the accused, Thomas and Zulhusni alighted from the Green Car.  Shortly thereafter, they were arrested by CNB officers.16Foot Note 16×SOF at para 20.",
        "Drug analysis": "11 A search of the Green Car was conducted by CNB officers.  The following items, among others, were seized from the boot of the Green Car:17Foot Note 17×SOF at para 5. (a) one off-white plastic bag with tape containing nine blocks of vegetable matter (later marked as “A1A1A”, “A1B1A”, “A1C1A”, “A1D1A”, “A1E1A”, “A1F1A”, “A1G1A”, “A1H1A” and “A1J1A” respectively);(b) one blue cooler bag containing,inter alia, seven blocks of vegetable matter (later marked as “A2A1A”, “A2B1A”, “A2C1A”, “A2D1A”, “A2E1A”, “A2F1A” and “A2G1A” respectively) and five packets of loose vegetable matter (later marked as “A2H1”, “A2J1”, “A2K1”, “A2L1” and “A2M1” respectively); and(c) one blue cooler bag containing seven blocks of vegetable matter (later marked as “A3A1A”, “A3B1A”, “A3B2A”, “A3C1A”, “A3C2A”, “A3D1A”, and “A3D2A” respectively). 12 Analysis of the blocks and packets of vegetable matter listed above (the “Drugs”) revealed that they contained the following quantities of cannabis:18Foot Note 18×SOF at paras 7–8.

        "The parties’ cases": "",
        "The sentencing framework": "14 Under s 33(1) of the MDA read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment for the offence in the charge was a minimum of 20 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane and a maximum of 30 years’ imprisonment or imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane.  As may be observed, the charge attracted a mandatory 15 strokes of the cane. 15 It was not disputed that the applicable sentencing framework for drug trafficking and importation offences was set out inVasenthad/o Joseph v Public Prosecutor[2015] 5 SLR 122 (“Vasentha”), which was endorsed by the Court of Appeal inSuventherShanmugam v Public Prosecutor[2017] 2 SLR 115 (“Suventher”).  The sentencing framework requires the court to first consider the quantity of drugs trafficked and arrive at an indicative starting point based on that.  Then, upward or downward adjustments are to be made to the starting point based on the offender’s culpability, and any aggravating or mitigating factors:Vasenthaat [44];Suventherat [28]–[30]. 16 At the first stage, the gravity of the offence is considered by having regard to the quantity of the controlled drugs.  This is because the drug quantity reflects the degree of harm to society.  The Court of Appeal inSuventherlaid down (at [29]) the applicable sentencing guidelines for the unauthorised import or trafficking of cannabis as follows: (a) 330g to 380g: 20 to 22 years’ imprisonment.(b) 381g to 430g: 23 to 25 years’ imprisonment.(c) 431g to 500g: 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment. 17 At the second stage, the offender’s culpability and any aggravating or mitigating factors are taken into account to adjust the indicative starting sentence upward or downward.  The High Court inVasenthaset out a non-exhaustive list of indicia (at [51]) for assessing an offender’s culpability as follows: CulpabilityIndiciaHigher•  Directing or organising drug trade on a commercial scale (eg, having regular clientele or offering wide variety of drugs)•  Involving others in the operation whether by pressure, influence, intimidation or reward•  Being motivated by financial or other advantage, whether operating as part of a drug syndicate or alone (eg, to sustain offender’s own drug habits)•  Taking active steps to avoid detection of the offenceLower•  Performing only a limited function under direction•  Being engaged by pressure, coercion and intimidation, or being involved through naivety and exploitation 18 Finally, the court may, where appropriate, take into account the time that the offender had spent in remand prior to the conviction, either by backdating the sentence or discounting the intended sentence:Vasenthaat [44(c)].",
        "The Prosecution’s submissions": "19 Regarding the first stage, the Prosecution took the view that the appropriate indicative starting point should be 29 years’ imprisonment.20Foot Note 20×Prosecution’s Written Submissions on Sentence (“PWS”) at para 5.This was because the quantity of cannabis in this case, namely, 499.99g, was at the furthest end of the weight bracket (see [13] above).  This, in turn, according to the Prosecution, warranted an indicative starting point at the far end of the corresponding sentencing range.21Foot Note 21×PWS at para 4. 20 Moving to the second stage, the Prosecution submitted that the accused’s culpability was moderate because there was nothing to suggest that the accused had committed the offence as a result of pressure, coercion, intimidation, naivety or exploitation.22Foot Note 22×PWS at para 7.The Prosecution accepted that mitigating weight ought to be placed on the accused’s plea of guilt, as well as his agreement to cooperate with the authorities and provide information on the other individuals involved in drug dealings after pleading guilty.23Foot Note 23×PWS at para 9.In respect of the accused’s early plea of guilt, the Prosecution clarified at the hearing that this meant that the accused had pleaded guilty once he was offered a non-capital charge.24Foot Note 24×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 11 lines 30–32 and p 12 line 1.However, the Prosecution also pointed out that an uplift in sentence was warranted given the second charge which was to be taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.25Foot Note 25×PWS at para 9.Having taken into account these factors, the Prosecution submitted that a downward adjustment from the indicative starting point to a sentence of about 26 years’ imprisonment was appropriate.26Foot Note 26×PWS at para 10. 21 The Prosecution also submitted that a sentence of 26 years’ imprisonment would be in line with sentencing precedents.  This was because, according to the Prosecution, after the sentencing guidelines had been laid down inSuventher, sentences in the range of 25 to 28 years’ imprisonment had been imposed on offenders convicted of charges involving the trafficking of not less than 499.99g of cannabis.27Foot Note 27×PWS at para 12.I address the cases cited by the Prosecution in more detail at [36]–[38] below. 22 Finally, the Prosecution had no objection to the sentence being backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest, which was 27 September 2018.28Foot Note 28×PWS at para 2.",
        "The Defence’s submissions": "23 The Defence made no specific submission as to the appropriate indicative starting point, but instead focussed on the mitigating factors and sentencing precedents in their submissions that a sentence of 23 years’ imprisonment would be appropriate.29Foot Note 29×Mitigation Plea at para 39. 24 The Defence submitted that the accused had committed the offence out of a “sense of misplaced friendship/loyalty” because Dean and Kumaran, whom the Defence said were very close friends of the accused, had requested the accused to help to collect the cannabis.30Foot Note 30×Mitigation Plea at paras 7 and 12.The Prosecution, in oral submissions, stated that it did not challenge this.31Foot Note 31×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 11 line 15.The Defence also emphasised the accused’s relatively young age of 21 at the time of the offence.32Foot Note 32×Mitigation Plea at para 8. 25 In terms of mitigating factors, the Defence stressed that the accused was remorseful, and this was evidenced by his early plea of guilt.33Foot Note 33×Mitigation Plea at para 16.Another mitigating factor was the accused’s cooperation with the authorities.34Foot Note 34×Mitigation Plea at para 30.These mitigating factors were, as already mentioned (at [20] above), accepted by the Prosecution.  As for the accused’s culpability, the Defence submitted that bearing in mind the indicia set out inVasentha(see [17] above), the accused’s culpability was on the lowest end.35Foot Note 35×Mitigation Plea at para 23.This was because he had only performed a very limited function on the instructions of Dean and Kumaran.36Foot Note 36×Mitigation Plea at para 23.He did not organise the drug transaction, he was not part of a drug syndicate, he did not involve anyone else, he was not motivated by financial gain and he also took no steps to avoid detection.37Foot Note 37×Mitigation Plea at paras 24–25. 26 In terms of antecedents, the accused had a clean record except for having been placed on drug supervision once in 2017.38Foot Note 38×Mitigation Plea at para 28; Transcript, 8 Apr, p 8 lines 22–23.The Defence emphasised the difference between being placed on drug supervision as opposed to drug rehabilitation,39Foot Note 39×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 16 lines 1; 20–24.the latter being a programme for high-risk abusers.  The Defence submitted that the accused was placed under supervision following a one-off incident where he consumed drugs, but that in truth, he was never a drug addict.40Foot Note 40×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 16 lines 14; 20–24.The Defence also pointed out that the accused had since been going for his supervised urine tests and had been testing negative.41Foot Note 41×Mitigation Plea at para 28; Transcript, 8 Apr, p 16 lines 12–13.The Prosecution confirmed that, at the time of his arrest, the accused’s urine tested negative for drugs.42Foot Note 42×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 14 lines 6–7. 27 The Defence also raised two cases in which the accused persons were charged with having trafficked quantities of drugs at the high end of the non-capital limit of Class A controlled drugs and received sentences of around 23 years’ imprisonment.  I deal with these cases in more detail at [39]–[40] below. 28 Finally, the Defence also urged the court to backdate the sentence to the accused’s date of arrest43Foot Note 43×Mitigation Plea at para 39.to which, as earlier mentioned (at [22] above), the Prosecution had no objections.",
        "Decision": "29 Deterrence is the primary sentencing consideration when dealing with the offence of drug trafficking.  At the same time, there must be proportionality in relation to the severity of the offence committed and the culpability of the offender in each case:Vasenthaat [35]. 30 I first considered the indicative starting point for the charge.  The sentencing framework inSuventher(set out at [15] above) provided a sentence of 26 to 29 years’ imprisonment for trafficking of 431g to 500g of cannabis.  Applying the sentencing framework to the present facts, I agreed with the Prosecution that the indicative starting point was 29 years’ imprisonment.  The quantity of cannabis in this case warranted an indicative starting point at the upper limit of the sentencing band.  This was consistent with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal inMurugesan a/l Arumugam v Public Prosecutor[2021] SGCA 32 (at [8]): Where someone has been found trafficking between 13.01 and 15 grams of diamorphine, the starting point is between 26 and 29 years of imprisonment. The present case involves trafficking in not less than 14.99 grams of diamorphine, which in turn represents the furthest end of the 13.01 to 15 gram bracket. Accordingly, it warrants a custodial starting point that lies at the far end of the corresponding sentencing range. In our view, 29 years of imprisonment should be the indicative starting point. 31 I turned next to an assessment of the accused’s culpability.  It appeared that his role involved the tasks of transferring the cannabis from the Tampines Block, and from the rider of the Malaysian motorcycle, to the Green Car.  However, beyond these acts, there was no suggestion that the accused was further involved in the drug transaction or the trafficking.  He did not direct or organise the drug transaction that day.  There was no suggestion that he was operating on a commercial scale or that he was motivated by financial gain.  There was also no suggestion that the accused was part of any drug syndicate.  He also did not take any active steps to avoid detection. 32 The Defence submitted that the accused was acting on the instructions of Kumaran and Dean, his two good friends, to assist them in relation to the drugs collected.  I noted that this was not challenged by the Prosecution (see [24] above).  While I accepted the Prosecution’s submission that the accused was not acting under any pressure, coercion or intimidation, one could say that he acted out of naivety arising from a misplaced sense of friendship and loyalty.  Applying the indicia set out inVasentha(see [17] above), I found that the accused’s role in the present case was quite limited.  As such, I found his culpability to be on the lower end of the scale. 33 Next, I considered the offender-specific aggravating and mitigating factors.  There was one charge of drug possession being taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing.  In terms of antecedents, I noted that the only blemish on the accused’s record was that he had previously been placed on drug supervision in 2017.  However, the Defence emphasised that the accused was not a drug abuser, and that he was not consuming drugs at the time of his arrest in respect of the charge in this case.  As already mentioned, it was common ground that the accused tested negative for drugs upon his arrest (see [26] above).  The Defence argued that the accused was not a drug addict and that was why he was only placed on drug supervision in 2017, and not sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre.  Since then, as the Defence pointed out, the accused had been passing his drug tests without any issues.  These assertions that the accused had not been consuming drugs since 2017, and was not a drug addict at the time of the offence, were not challenged by the Prosecution.  In these circumstances, I gave limited weight to the fact that the accused was previously placed on drug supervision. 34 I found that the aggravating factors in this case were outweighed by two key mitigating factors.  First, the accused pleaded guilty at an early stage once the offer of a non-capital charge was made to him.  Secondly, the accused agreed to cooperate with the authorities.  Indeed, the Prosecution accepted that mitigating weight had to be placed on the early plea of guilt as well as the fact that the accused had agreed to cooperate with the authorities and provide information on the other persons involved in drug dealings after pleading guilty.  These factors demonstrated the accused’s remorse. 35 Before arriving at an appropriate adjustment from the indicative starting point, I considered the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution and the Defence.  As earlier mentioned (at [21]), the Prosecution submitted that the range of 25 to 28 years’ imprisonment had been imposed on offenders convicted of charges involving the trafficking of not less than 499.99g of cannabis.  I found that the case at hand was distinguishable from those cases cited by the Prosecution and warranted a lower sentence. 36 On the highest end of the range, the accused inPublic Prosecutor vPoopathi Chinaiyah s/o Paliandi[2020] 5 SLR 734 (“PoopathiChinaiyah”)was sentenced to 28 years’ imprisonment in respect of a charge for possession of not less than 499.99g of cannabis for the purpose of trafficking.  There, it was a significant aggravating factor that the accused had a previous conviction for trafficking in cannabis and re-offended about three years after his release:PoopathiChinaiyahat [22(c)] and [27].  Further, the accused inPoopathiChinaiyahhad a more involved role compared to the accused’s role in the present case, and he was motivated by financial reward.  He received, stored and delivered consignments of drugs under the instructions of one “Mala” on multiple occasions in exchange for money:PoopathiChinaiyahat [11] and [22(b)].  The relevant considerations inPoopathiChinaiyahwere clearly different from those in the present case. 37 InPublic Prosecutor v Muhammad Nur Azam bin Mohamad Indra and another[2020] 4 SLR 1255 (“Muhammad Nur Azam”), the accused was sentenced to 26 years’ imprisonment in respect of a charge for importation of not less than 499.99g of cannabis.  There, the fact that the accused was paid for bringing cannabis into Singapore pointed towards a higher sentence:Muhammad Nur Azamat [35].  Further, there were two charges taken into consideration for the purposes of sentencing, one of which was for importation of methamphetamine.  That increased the culpability of the accused compared to someone who faced a single charge:Muhammad Nur Azamat [34].  In the present case, the accused did not profit financially and only had one charge for unauthorised possession of a controlled drug taken into consideration.  That charge was less serious as compared to a charge for importation of methamphetamine. 38 Finally, inKannan s/oBirasenggam v Public Prosecutor[2021] SGCA 15 (“Kannan s/oBirasenggam”), the accused was sentenced to 25 years and 7 months’ imprisonment in respect of a charge for trafficking in not less than 499.99g of cannabis.  The accused’s plea of guilt, the limited role he played in the transaction and the fact that he did not receive any monetary reward were taken into account as mitigating factors.  However, it was an aggravating factor that the accused had committed the offence while on bail. This resulted in the reduction of his sentence from the indicative starting point of 29 years’ imprisonment to 26 years’ imprisonment:Kannan s/oBirasenggamat [7].  The sentence was further reduced from 26 years’ imprisonment to 25 years and 7 months’ imprisonment to take into account the accused’s earlier period of remand:Kannan s/oBirasenggamat [7].  The present case is distinguishable in that there is the absence of the aggravating factor of offending while on bail. 39 The Defence, on the other hand, drew my attention to cases in which accused persons charged with trafficking quantities of drugs at the high end of the non-capital limit of Class A controlled drugs were sentenced to around 23 years’ imprisonment.  InPublic Prosecutor v Muhammad NorHaiqal bin Shaman[2017] SGHC 292 (“Muhammad NorHaiqal”), the accused was sentenced to 23 years’ imprisonment in respect of a charge for having not less than 249.99g of methamphetamine in his possession for the purpose of trafficking.  The accused was 20 years old at the time of offending and was a drug addict.  His role was limited to acting solely on one Jivan’s instructions, which involved receiving parcels of drugs sent to Jivan, and repacking and delivering them.  The accused did this in part to feed his own addiction and in part to secure a roof over his head:Muhammad NorHaiqalat [5]–[6]. 40 InParthiban a/lKanapathy v Public Prosecutor[2021] 2 SLR 847 (“ParthibanKanapathy”), the accused’s sentence of 23 years and 9 months’ imprisonment in respect of a charge for importation of not less than 14.99g of diamorphine was upheld by the Court of Appeal.  The accused was 20 years old at the time of offending.  He was motivated by financial advantage and took steps to conceal the drugs in his motorcycle, which were both indicia of higher culpability:ParthibanKanapathyat [24]. 41 The Prosecution highlighted thatMuhammad NorHaiqalandParthibanKanapathywere distinguishable from the present case as the offenders in those cases were below the age of 21 at the time of offending.44Foot Note 44×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 12 lines 11–13.In this case, the accused was 21 years of age at the time of the offence.  While the accused was an adult at the time of offending, his relatively young age as an adult could be taken into consideration in sentencing (seeeg,Public Prosecutorv Pham Duyen Quyen[2016] 5 SLR 1289 at [58] andSohQiu Xia Katty v Public Prosecutor[2019] 3 SLR 568 at [69]), as was rightly accepted by the Prosecution.45Foot Note 45×Transcript, 8 Apr, p 13 lines 7–9.Accordingly, I took this factor into account when considering the appropriate sentence. 42 It appeared, from the sentencing precedents cited by the Prosecution and the Defence in their submissions, that sentences ranging from 23 to 28 years’ imprisonment were meted out for offenders convicted of charges involving the trafficking of quantities of drugs at the high end of the non-capital limit of Class A controlled drugs.  For the reasons stated above, the case at hand was distinguishable from the cited cases.  The present case did not involve certain aggravating factors and indicia of higher culpability that were present in the cases cited by the Prosecution, but, unlike the cases cited by the Defence, the accused was an adult at the time of offending (albeit a relatively young one).  Having regard to all the aggravating and mitigating factors, on a holistic assessment of the facts of this case, I found that a discount of 5 years was fair.  This brought the sentence down from the indicative starting point (of 29 years’ imprisonment) to 24 years’ imprisonment. 43 As for the sentence of caning, as earlier mentioned (at [14] above), the charge attracted the mandatory 15 strokes of the cane.",
        "Conclusion": "44 For these reasons, I sentenced the accused to 24 years’ imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane.  The Defence had asked, and the Prosecution did not object, that the sentence was to be backdated to the date of arrest.  I ordered the sentence to be backdated to the date of the accused’s arrest, which was 27 September 2018.
