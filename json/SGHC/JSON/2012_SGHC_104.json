        "Introduction": "1       The plaintiff, Hai Tong Co\n                    Pte Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), is a company\n                    incorporated in Singapore. It carries on the business of\n                    importing, exporting, distributing and selling cosmetics,\n                    sundries and beauty accessories, including a range of\n                    cosmetic products under the brand “Lady Rose”. The first defendant,\n                    Ventree Singapore Pte Ltd (“the\n                        1stDefendant”), is a\n                    company incorporated in Singapore. The\n                        1stDefendant is in the\n                    business of importing, exporting and distributing cosmetic\n                    products, and is the distributor of “Rose\n                    Lady” cosmetic products pursuant to a Sole Agent\n                    Agreement with the manufacturer of these products, VOV\n                    Cosmetics Co Ltd (“VOV Cosmetics”). VOV\n                    Cosmetics is a company incorporated in South Korea and is\n                    not a party to the present proceedings. VOV Cosmetics is the\n                    registered proprietor of the “VOV” trade mark\n                    in Singapore, which was registered in 2004 under Trade Mark\n                    Number T0406108D. The second defendant, SKY (“the\n                        2ndDefendant”), is a\n                    partnership incorporated in Singapore. It operates a retail\n                    department store at People’s Park Complex selling,inter alia, cosmetics and\n                    perfumes, including cosmetic products from the “Rose\n                    Lady” brand. It previously sold products from the\n                    Plaintiff’s “Lady\n                        Rose” brand, but has not sold the\n                    Plaintiff’s products since around 2005.",
        "Factual Background": "2       With regard to the\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    brand, the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor of the\n                    following mark (“the “Lady\n                        Rose” mark”): Trade\n                                        Mark NoTrade\n                                        markSpecificationsT7048436BPerfumery, essential oils, hair\n                                        lotions, hair creams and\n                                        cosmetics.   3       The “Lady Rose” mark was\n                    registered by the Plaintiff’s predecessor (Hai Tong\n                    Company) in 1970, and has been in use by the Plaintiff\n                    and/or its predecessors since 1960. The Plaintiff\n                    distributes its “Lady\n                        Rose” products to various retailers\n                    across Singapore, including department stores such as\n                    Robinsons and retail cosmetics shops. The Plaintiff also\n                    sells these products to walk-in customers at its shop in\n                    Sago Lane. In particular, the Plaintiff sells two cosmetic\n                    products under the “Lady\n                        Rose” mark,viza two way cake and a foundation with\n                    sunscreen. 4       On 15 July 2009, the\n                        1stDefendant entered into a\n                    Sole Agent Agreement with VOV Cosmetics which allowed the\n                    former to import and distribute VOV Cosmetics’\n                    products, including a range of VOV Cosmetics’ products\n                    bearing the words “Rose Lady”. These products\n                    containedrosacanina, essence of dog rose, as an\n                    ingredient. The product packaging was peach and featured\n                    sketches of five-petalled flowers. The\n                        1stDefendant imported three\n                    “Rose Lady” products into Singapore:\n                    “VOV” Rose Lady Cover Foundation,\n                    “VOV” Rose Lady Skin Cover, and\n                    “VOV” Rose Lady Two Way Cake (“the\n                    Infringing Products”). VOV Cosmetics’ products\n                    were sold at various retailers across Singapore, including\n                    department stores such as John Little and retail cosmetics\n                    shops. The 2ndDefendant sold\n                    “VOV” Rose Lady Skin Cover since January 2010,\n                    but did not sell the other two Infringing\n                Products. 5       In or around July 2010, the\n                    Plaintiff received a number of complaints from its customers\n                    regarding the quality of certain “Lady Rose” cosmetic products packaged\n                    in a peach coloured case. As the Plaintiff uses blue\n                    packaging for the “Lady\n                        Rose” cosmetic products, it became\n                    concerned about the possibility of counterfeit\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    products on the market and proceeded to conduct\n                    investigations into the matter. As a result of its\n                    investigations, the Plaintiff became aware that the\n                        1stDefendant was importing\n                    VOV’s “Rose Lady” cosmetic products into\n                    Singapore. The Plaintiff also discovered that these\n                    “Rose Lady” cosmetic products were being sold\n                    at a number of other retail outlets in Singapore, including\n                    but not limited to the 2ndDefendant’s retail store. 6       On or about 21 July 2010,\n                    the Plaintiff through its solicitors issued a Letter of\n                    Demand to the 1stDefendant\n                    claiming,inter alia, that the\n                        1stDefendant had infringed\n                    the Plaintiff’s “Lady\n                        Rose” mark. On 23 July 2010, the\n                        1stDefendant replied through\n                    its solicitors denying all allegations of trade mark\n                    infringement. The Plaintiff through its solicitors also sent\n                    a cease-and-desist letter to the\n                        2ndDefendant. On 1 August\n                    2010, the Plaintiff filed this action against the\n                        1stand\n                        2ndDefendants (the\n                    “Defendants”), claiming that they had\n                    infringed the Plaintiff’s “Lady Rose” mark by importing and\n                    offering for sale the Infringing Products, and also alleging\n                    that the Defendants had acted together to pass off the\n                    Infringing Products as the Plaintiff’s goods. The\n                        1stDefendant has since\n                    ceased importing the Infringing Products.",
        "The Plaintiff’s claims": "7       In the Plaintiff’s\n                    Statement of Claim, the Plaintiff alleged that the\n                    Defendants had done the following: (a)     Infringed the\n                        registered trade mark of the Plaintiff by the use in the\n                        course of trade of a sign where, because the sign was\n                        similar to the registered trade mark and was used in\n                        relation to goods similar or identical to those for\n                        which the registered trade mark was registered, there\n                        existed a likelihood of confusion;\n                    and (b)     Passed off and/or attempted to pass off and/or\n                        enabled, assisted, caused or procured others to pass\n                        off, the cosmetic products marketed under and by\n                        reference to the mark “Rose Lady”, not\n                        being goods of the Plaintiff, as and for the\n                        same. 8       I turn first to consider the\n                    trade mark infringement claim.",
        "Trade Mark Infringement": "9       Section 27(2)(b) of the\n                    Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 2005 Rev Ed) (“TMA”)\n                    provides thus: (2)    A person infringes a\n                            registered trade mark if, without the consent of the\n                            proprietor of the trade mark, heuses in the course of tradea\n                            sign wherebecause— … (b)    the sign issimilarto the\n                                trade mark and is used in relation\n                                    togoods or services\n                                    identical with or similar to those for which\n                                    the trade mark is\n                                registered, thereexists a likelihood of\n                            confusionon the part of the\n                        public. [emphasis added] 10     Section 2(1) of the TMA\n                    defines the term “sign” thus: any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device,\n                        brand, heading, label, ticket, shape, colour, aspect of\n                        packaging or any combination thereof. 11     Here, the Plaintiff first\n                    had to establish that the “Rose Lady” sign was\n                    used in the course of trade by the Defendants. If this\n                    threshold issue was resolved in favour of the Plaintiff, the\n                    Plaintiff then had to show the following three elements in\n                    order to establish an infringement under s 27(2)(b) of\n                    the TMA (applyingThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP\n                        v Shop-In Department Store Pte\n                    Ltd[2006]\n                        2 SLR(R) 690 (“Polo”) at [8]): (a)     The “Rose\n                        Lady” sign used by the Defendants was similar to\n                        the Plaintiff’s “Lady\n                            Rose” trade\n                    mark; (b)     The “Rose Lady” sign was used in\n                        relation to goods or services identical or similar to\n                        those for which the Plaintiff’s “Lady Rose” trade mark was\n                        registered; and (c)     On account of (a) and\n                        (b) above, there was a likelihood of confusion on\n                        the part of the public.",
        "Whether the “Rose Lady” sign was\n                used by the Defendants in the course of trade": "12     The Defendants submitted\n                    before me that the words “Rose Lady” were\n                    descriptive of cosmetic products made with essence of therosacaninaplant that were intended for\n                    ladies’ use. They further argued that the words were\n                    commonly used in the cosmetics industry, and merely\n                    descriptive of common features of cosmetic products.\n                    However, I did not accept these arguments. I found that the\n                    combination of the two words “Rose” and\n                    “Lady” was distinctive rather than\n                    descriptive. InBluestar Exchange\n                        (Singapore) Pte Ltd v TeohKeng Long and others (trading as Polykwan Trading\n                        Co)[2003] 4 SLR(R) 92, the\n                    court held at [40]: While the words “BLUE” and\n                        “STAR” are common words individually and\n                        each was used in marks belonging to others, it was the\n                        combination of these two words which, in my view, gave\n                        the RTM its distinctive character... The combination of\n                        two common words can be distinctive like “Burger\n                        King”. 13     Here, the Defendants used\n                    “Rose Lady” as a brand name for a line of\n                    cosmetics under which they marketed a range of products. I\n                    found that although “Rose” and\n                    “Lady” were common words individually, when\n                    used together in this manner they had a distinctive\n                    character which enabled the sign to function as a trade mark\n                    and identify a line of products. Under cross-examination,\n                    the Defendants’ witness Mr Goh Soo Ching, a partner of\n                    the 2ndDefendant, admitted that\n                    “Rose Lady” was being used as the name of a\n                    particular range of products, rather than to describe any of\n                    the ingredients in the products: Ct:You used a name to identify a\n                            range? A:Okay, if for example for this,\n                            maybe they will – they will call this the Rose\n                            Lady range. Ct:Oh I see. A:The range of it... for this\n                            brand. Ct:Basically it’s a name,\n                            it’s not as if to describe it\n                        – A:Correct. Ct:- but it’s a name\n                            ... ... Ct:So that [“Rose\n                            Lady”] is used as a name. A:Yes, right. Ct:Not so much as to describe\n                            what is in the ingredient of the\n                        product. A:Yes. 14     The Defendants also argued\n                    that “Rose Lady” was not being used as a trade\n                    mark, as the Infringing Products were actually being\n                    marketed under the “VOV” trade mark. The\n                    Defendants submitted that the Infringing Products were made\n                    by VOV Cosmetics, and sold together with other\n                    “VOV” products. They further submitted that\n                    the dominant mark on the packaging of the Infringing\n                    Products was the “VOV” mark, and that the\n                    photographs of the Infringing Products revealed that they\n                    were marketed as “VOV Rose Lady” products\n                    rather than “Rose Lady” productsper se. The Defendants further\n                    argued that “Rose Lady” was not being used as\n                    a secondary mark to identify a range of products in the\n                    “VOV” line. They highlighted that “Rose\n                    Lady” was not a registered trade mark in Singapore,\n                    in contrast to VOV Cosmetics’ registered trade marks\n                    “JADILLA J” and “CASTLEDEW”,\n                    which were used on certain ranges of VOV Cosmetics’\n                    products. 15     However, I did not accept\n                    the Defendants’ arguments. I found that “Rose\n                    Lady” was a secondary product identifier that was\n                    being used as a secondary mark. InRichemont International SA v Da Vinci\n                        Collections Pte Ltd[2006]\n                    4 SLR(R) 369, the court stated at[14]that: …. [I]t is well established in trade mark law\n                        that a product may have more than one trade mark. Thus,\n                        secondary or even third-level product identifiers can\n                        function as trade marks if they indicate to the consumer\n                        that the product originates from a particular\n                        undertaking. 16     InBritish Sugar PLC v James Robertson &\n                        Sons Ltd(1996) RPC 281, the court\n                    observed at 299 that: It is of course the case that you can have two trade\n                        marks used together (“Ford Prefect”), but\n                        whether the secondary word is used as a trade mark is a\n                        question of fact. If it is a fancy word, then obviously\n                        it is a trade mark because it could not be taken as\n                        anything else. As such, although the Infringing Products also had\n                    the “VOV” trade mark on the packaging, that\n                    did not in and of itself preclude the possibility that\n                    “Rose Lady” was also being used as a secondary\n                    trade mark on the Infringing Products. Additionally, as\n                    discussed above at[12]–[13], “Rose\n                    Lady” was not a descriptive phrase but instead a\n                    fancy mark. 17     InNeutrogena Corporation v GoldenLtd(t/a Garnier)[1996] RPC 473, the marks being compared were\n                    “NEUTRALIA”, used on a narrow product range of\n                    a shampoo, facial wash, shower gel, bath foam, moisturisers\n                    and liquid soaps, and “NEUTROGENA”, used on a\n                    wider range of soaps, shampoos and other skin and hair care\n                    products. The “NEUTRALIA” products were sold\n                    in clear transparent bottles (the liquid inside also being\n                    clear), with the name “LABORATORIES GARNIER”\n                    on the front bottom right of the bottle. In relation to the\n                    visibility of the name “LABORATORIES GARNIER”,\n                    the court said at 481: Owing to the clarity of the bottle and contents\n                        however, these words do not stand out. I find as a fact\n                        that many consumers simply do not notice them,\n                        particularly (but by no means only) in shopping\n                        conditions. 18     Here, I found that\n                    “Rose Lady” was being used as a secondary mark\n                    on the Defendants’ products: the words “Rose\n                    Lady Skin Cover” and “Rose Lady Two Way\n                    Cake” were prominently displayed in the middle of the\n                    front covers of the packaging, whereas the words\n                    “Rose Lady Cover Foundation” were prominently\n                    displayed in the middle of the back cover of the packaging\n                    and the words “Rose Lady Cover Foundation” on\n                    the product itself could be seen through the transparent\n                    front cover of the packaging, thus indicating to the\n                    consumer that the three products originated from the\n                    “Rose Lady” line. In contrast, the\n                    “VOV” mark was not prominently displayed. The\n                    “VOV” mark appeared in a much smaller font at\n                    the bottom corner of the front cover and on two sides of the\n                    packaging for the “Rose Lady Skin Cover” and\n                    “Rose Lady Two Way Cake” products. For the\n                    “Rose Lady Cover Foundation”, the\n                    “VOV” mark appeared in a much smaller font at\n                    the bottom of the back cover and on three sides of the\n                    packaging, and was partly shielded from view on the\n                    transparent front cover of the packaging. The\n                    “VOV” trade mark did not even appear on both\n                    the “Rose Lady Skin Cover” and the\n                    “Rose Lady Two Way Cake” products themselves.\n                    Instead, the words “Rose Lady Skin Cover” and\n                    “Rose Lady Two Way Cake” appeared prominently\n                    on the front covers of the two products. As such, I found\n                    that “Rose Lady” was a secondary product\n                    identifier that was being used as a secondary mark. Clearly,\n                    the “Rose Lady” sign was used by the\n                    Defendants in the course of trade.",
        "Whether the “Rose Lady” sign used\n                by the Defendants was similar to the Plaintiff’s\n                “Lady Rose” trade mark": "19     The Plaintiff had to prove\n                    that there was similarity between the allegedly infringing\n                    sign “Rose Lady” and the Plaintiff’s\n                    registered trade mark “Lady\n                        Rose”.

It is\n                    evident from the case law that marks having identical words\n                    in an inverted sequence can be visually\n                similar. 22     Here, the\n                    Defendants’ sign consisted of the same two words\n                    present in the Plaintiff’s mark. Both were also\n                    identical in length and had the same number of words. The\n                    main difference was the sequence in which the words were\n                    placed, but as held in the cases above, marks with identical\n                    words in an inverted sequence could be deceptively\n                    similar. 23     Additionally, when\n                    comparing two marks visually, “what is relevant is\n                    the ‘imperfect recollection’ of the\n                    consumer” (Nautical Concept Pte\n                        Ltd v Jeffrey Mark Richard[2007]\n                    1 SLR(R) 1071 at [30]).

Here, the Defendants tried to\n                    argue that the two marks were visually dissimilar as the\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    mark included a drawing of a rose and was in a cursive font,\n                    whereas the “Rose Lady” mark did not include\n                    the drawing of a rose and was in a plain letter font.\n                    However, the words “Lady\n                        Rose” do stand out prominently in the\n                    Plaintiff’s mark. With imperfect recollection, a\n                    consumer who had seen the Plaintiff’s\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    mark on a product previously, and now with the\n                    Defendants’ product bearing the “Rose\n                    Lady” mark before her, might imagine the “Rose\n                    Lady” mark to be similar to her vague recollection of\n                    the “Lady Rose”\n                    mark in her mind. As such, I found that the two marks were\n                    visually similar.

InHedgefund\n                        Intelligence, the court held at [39] that “the fact\n                    that the syllables are pronounced in an inverted order\n                    cannot prevent the signs from being similar overall.\n                    Consequently, there is a certain phonetic similarity between\n                    them.” Here, the marks shared very strong aural\n                    similarity, especially with imperfect recollection on the\n                    part of consumers being taken into account. When spoken\n                    carelessly or quickly, the marks would sound highly similar.\n                    Indeed, the phonetic similarity was actually evidenced in\n                    the course of the trial, where parties sometimes said\n                    “Rose Lady” when they actually intended to\n                    refer to the “Lady\n                    Rose” mark, andvice\n                        versa. To a person who was not paying close\n                    attention to the inversion of the two words, he or she could\n                    easily be confused and use “Rose Lady” and\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    interchangeably. Under cross-examination, the\n                    Defendants’ witness Mr Goh Soo Ching conceded that the\n                    two marks were similar: Q:Would you accept\n                        – A:Mmhm. Q:- that the two names, as you\n                            call them, “Lady Rose” and\n                            “Rose Lady” are similar? A:Mm, I – I can\n                            accept. Q:You accept. A:Yes. Conceptual similarity 25     When assessing the\n                    question of conceptual similarity, it is necessary to\n                    consider the “ideas that lie behind or inform\n                    the earlier mark” (Bently &\n                        Shermanat 866). Here, there was very\n                    strong conceptual similarity between the two marks: the\n                    composite words of both marks were identical, and both marks\n                    evoked the idea of something floral and feminine. The word\n                    “Rose” in “Rose Lady” also\n                    described the flower which formed a part of the\n                    Plaintiff’s mark. 26     As such, I found that the\n                    two marks were similar as they shared strong visual, aural\n                    and conceptual similarities.",
        "Whether the “Rose Lady” sign was\n                used in relation to goods or services identical or similar to\n                those for which the Plaintiff’s “Lady Rose”\n                trade mark was registered": "27     In determining whether the\n                    goods are identical, the court will look at the\n                    specification of goods for which the registered trade mark\n                    is registered and the primary purpose(s) for which they are\n                    or are to be used, and compare that with the goods on which\n                    the offending mark is applied.

InPolo, the Court of Appeal held thus\n                    at [28]: The question of likelihood of confusion has to be\n                        looked at globally taking into account all the\n                        circumstance including the closeness of the goods, the\n                        impression given by the marks, the possibility of\n                        imperfect recollection and the risk that the public\n                        might believe that the goods come from the same source\n                        or economically-linked sources. 30     Here, I found that there\n                    was a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public.\n                    First, as discussed above, there was a high degree of\n                    similarity in the marks, and the goods were identical. As\n                    the court inFerreroheld at\n                    [98], “accordingly, it stands to reason that where\n                    there isgreater\n                        similarityin the marks and the goods,\n                    it would be easier to find a likelihood of\n                    confusion.” 31     Second, the goods were\n                    also being marketed in similar retail locations such as\n                    departmental stores and cosmetics shops, and targeted the\n                    same group of customers, females who used cosmetics. It thus\n                    followed that there was a risk that the public might believe\n                    that the “Rose Lady” goods came from the same\n                    source as the “Lady\n                        Rose” goods, or from\n                    economically-linked sources. Additionally, Mr Park In Pil,\n                    director of the 1stDefendant,\n                    had conceded under cross-examination that it was possible\n                    that consumers could be confused by the similarity of the\n                    two marks: Q:Right,\n                                        right, so that is actually my example,\n                                        the mother just says to the daughter,\n                                        “Please buy a Lady Rose\n                                        foundation for me.” The daughter\n                                        goes to the shop, she sees “Rose\n                                        Lady”. He’s already\n                                        accepted that “Lady Rose,”\n                                        “Rose Lady” are similar.\n                                        So it must follow that the daughter can\n                                        come into the shop and be led to believe\n                                        that they are the same product. You\n                                        agree,\n                                    right?”Interpreter:He\n                                        agrees about the\n                                    point.   32     As such, I found there was\n                    likelihood that a substantial portion of\n                    the relevant public,vizconsumers of cosmetic products, would\n                    be confused.",
        "Conclusion on trade mark infringement": "33     I thus found that the\n                    Plaintiff had made out all the elements under s 27(2)(b) of\n                    the TMA, and succeeded in establishing trade mark\n                    infringement.",
        "Passing Off": "34     The Plaintiff must\n                    establish the following elements to succeed in an action for\n                    passing off. InNovelty Pte Ltd v\n                        Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009]\n                    3 SLR(R) 216 (“Amanresorts”), the court held at\n                        [36], [37] and [69]: (a)    First, that the plaintiff has\n                            goodwill attached to the goods which he supplies in\n                            the mind of the purchasing public by association\n                            with the identifying “get-up” (whether\n                            it consists simply of a brand name or a trade\n                            description, or the individual features of labelling\n                            or packaging) under which his particular goods are\n                            offered to the public, such that the get-up is\n                            recognised by the public as distinctive specifically\n                            of the plaintiff’s goods. (b)    Second, that the defendant has\n                            made a misrepresentation to the public (whether\n                            intentional or otherwise) leading or likely to lead\n                            the public to believe that goods offered by the\n                            defendant are those of the plaintiff;\n                        and (c)    Third, that the plaintiff\n                            suffers or, in a quia timet action, is likely to\n                            suffer, damage to the plaintiff’s goodwill by\n                            reason of the erroneous belief engendered by the\n                            defendant’s misrepresentation. 35     The court inFerreroheld at [197]: In determining whether goodwill exists in a\n                            name,exposureof the name is the relevant\n                        criterion (Amanresortsat [53]). Proving goodwill\n                        or distinctiveness is a question of fact (City Chainat [62]).\n                        Possible indicia of goodwill include volume of sales,\n                        trading, advertisements and promotion expenditure\n                            (ibid;Caterpillarat [64]). However,\n                        mere sales figures without more are not necessarily\n                        coincident with goodwill (Nation\n                            Fittingsat [158]). 36     Here, the Plaintiff had\n                    not conducted any market surveys which indicated the market\n                    share of its products in the cosmetics industry.\n                     Although the Plaintiff provided its annual sales\n                    turnover for “Lady\n                    Rose” products from 2003 to June 2010,\n                    these were “mere sales figures without more”\n                    – the Plaintiff did not proceed to elaborate\n                    on the significance of these figures or how they\n                    related to volume of sales of its cosmetic products. The\n                    annual sales figures, which represented sales of both\n                    cosmetics and non-cosmetic products, were not particularly\n                    impressive as can be seen in the table below: Plaintiff’s Sales Figures YearAnnual\n                                        Sales (SGD)2003223,243.002004209,830.002005270,444.002006288,758.002007265,613.002008253,272.002009235,150.002010171,664.02June\n                                        201159,582.00   As the above were combined sales figures, it was\n                    not clear what the sales figures were specifically for the\n                    Plaintiff’s cosmetic products. Additionally, the fact\n                    that the Plaintiff had not advertised its products since\n                    1979 suggested that there had been negligible exposure of\n                    the “Lady Rose”\n                    name in the media: this was not a case where the Plaintiff\n                    had been actively promoting brand consciousness or awareness\n                    through advertising, thereby actively cultivating goodwill\n                    in the name. Although the Plaintiff claimed that it had an\n                    ongoing incentive promotion programme of providing free\n                    goods to retailers, no evidence was adduced of actual\n                    advertising and promotion to the public by the Plaintiff.\n                    The Plaintiff was also unable to show evidence that the\n                    benefits of the alleged incentive promotion were extended by\n                    the retailers to the public when cross-examined during the\n                    course of the trial. As such, apart from the fact that the\n                    Plaintiff and/or its predecessors had traded under the\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    mark for more than 40 years, it failed to adduce any further\n                    evidence of goodwill before this court. The\n                    Plaintiff’s case appeared to be based largely on the\n                    bare assertion that it necessarily had goodwill because it\n                    had been trading under this mark for some 40\n                years. 37     It was stated in Morcom,\n                    Roughton and Malynicz, The Modern Law of Trade Marks,\n                    (LexisNexis, 3rd Ed, 2008) at paragraph 14.19 that: At some point a reputation may be\n                        respected by such a small group of people that it will\n                        not support a passing off action. As Laddie J said inSutherland v V2 Music\n                            Ltd[2002] EWHC 14 (Ch): “The law of passing off protects a small\n                            business as much as the large, but it will not\n                            interfere to protect the goodwill which any\n                            reasonable person would consider\n                            trivial.” InHart v Relentless Records\n                            Ltd[2003] FSR 36 Jacob J (as he then\n                        was) said the court is looking for more than minimal\n                        reputation. A goodwill of trivial extent will not be\n                        protected. In that case Mr Justice Jacob described the\n                        claimant as “unmemorable minnow”. Another\n                        consequence of minimal goodwill in that case was that\n                        there was no damage. 38     For proof of damage or a\n                    likelihood of damage, the Plaintiff simply asserted that\n                    likelihood of damage to its ability to exploit the goodwill\n                    itself could be readily inferred from the fact that the\n                    Infringing Products were in direct competition with the\n                    Plaintiff’s “Lady\n                        Rose” products. The Plaintiff failed\n                    to adduce any evidence before me that there was damage or a\n                    likelihood of damage. Instead, in its closing submissions,\n                    it simply invited the court to infer a likelihood of damage\n                    based on the fact that the Plaintiff and Defendants were in\n                    a common field of activity. On balance, I was not able to\n                    infer that there was a real likelihood of damage to the\n                    Plaintiff’s meagre goodwill owing to the\n                    Defendants’ alleged misrepresentation. 39     A plaintiff might have\n                    used a mark or brand name on its goods for a substantial\n                    number of years. But without adequate and sustained\n                    promotion and advertisement, especially in the crowded and\n                    competitive cosmetics market place in Singapore, it could\n                    well have remained largely unknown to the relevant sector of\n                    the public and would thus have hardly any reputation and\n                    goodwill to speak about. On the facts of this case, even if\n                    there was any goodwill in “Lady\n                        Rose”, in my view it would only be\n                    trivial. Under these circumstances, the Plaintiff would have\n                    a much more difficult evidential task to establish actual\n                    damage or a real likelihood of damage to its goodwill on a\n                    balance of probabilities. 40     More often than not, it\n                    would have been a defendant, who was relatively unknown in\n                    the market place and having inferior goods or products, who\n                    would try to represent its goods in such a way as to pass\n                    them off as goods of a far more established, well known and\n                    superior brand. It would be indeed rare for a defendant with\n                    an established, well known and superior brand to pass off\n                    its goods as that of a largely unknown and inferior brand of\n                    a plaintiff. Quite apart from having no good commercial\n                    reason for doing so, the defendant would also run the risk\n                    of ruining the goodwill in its own reputable\n                brand. 41     I was more inclined to\n                    believe that “VOV”, with its far wider range\n                    of cosmetic products, was a better known brand than\n                        “Lady Rose”.\n                    With hardly any evidence of damage to the Plaintiff’s\n                    goodwill placed before me, I was not prepared on the facts\n                    of this case to find or infer, on a balance of\n                    probabilities, that there was damage or a real likelihood of\n                    damage to the very limited goodwill of the\n                Plaintiff. 42     It would be pertinent to\n                    note what the Court of Appeal inAmanresortsheld at [94]: The tort of passing off protects the plaintiff against\n                        damage caused to the goodwill attached to its business,\n                        goods or services by the defendant’s\n                        misrepresentation. Thus, even if the defendant’s\n                        misrepresentation is shown to have caused or to be\n                        likely to cause confusion between the plaintiff’s\n                        business, goods or services and those of the defendant,\n                        such misrepresentation is not in itself actionable under\n                        the law of passing off unless it has caused (or is\n                        likely to cause) damage to the plaintiff’s\n                        goodwill. 43     As the Plaintiff failed to\n                    discharge its burden of proving that there was damage or a\n                    likelihood of damage to its goodwill, I found that the\n                    passing off claim had not been made out and dismissed it\n                    accordingly.",
        "Conclusion": "44     Having found that the\n                    Defendants had infringed the Plaintiff’s\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    word mark under s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I accordingly granted\n                    the Plaintiff the following injunctions to restrain the\n                    Defendants from infringing the Plaintiff’s\n                        “Lady Rose”\n                    mark: (a)     An injunction to\n                        restrain the 1stDefendant,\n                        whether acting by its directors, officers, employees,\n                        agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever, from\n                        infringing Trade Mark Registration No T7048436B;\n                        and (b)     An injunction to restrain the\n                            2ndDefendant and each of\n                        its partners, whether acting by himself, his employees\n                        or agents or any of them or otherwise howsoever, from\n                        infringing Trade Mark Registration No\n                    T7048436B. 45     I also made the following\n                    ancillary orders: (a)     An order for\n                        delivery-up and/or destruction upon oath of all\n                        products, printed or written matter, packaging and all\n                        other articles in the power, possession, custody and/or\n                        control of the Defendants and each of them, the use of\n                        which would be in breach of the foregoing\n                        injunction(s); (b)     An inquiry as to damages suffered by\n                        the Plaintiff, or at the Plaintiff’s option, an\n                        account of profits; and (c)     An order for payment to the\n                        Plaintiff of all sums found due upon taking such inquiry\n                        or account, together with interest thereon pursuant to\n                        Section 12 of the Civil Law Act, at such rate and for\n                        such period as the Court thinks\n                fit. 46     With regard to costs, I\n                    ordered that the Plaintiff was to have 90% of its costs paid\n                    by the Defendants. Although the Plaintiff did not succeed in\n                    its claim for passing off, I found that on the whole it had\n                    succeeded in its case and obtained the desired\n                    remedies."
