        "The plaintiff’s version": "2. At the time of the accident, the\n\nplaintiff was a 23 year old undergraduate at the National University of Singapore.3. According to her affidavit, at about\n\n7.10pm on 18 July 1999, the plaintiff was riding her motorcycle FP 7202 U along East Coast\n\nRoad in the direction of Still Road. As she approached the junction of East Coast Road and\n\nStill Road/Still Road South, she could see that the traffic light was showing red against\n\nher and she slowed her speed to about 20 to 30 kmph with a view to stopping. As the\n\nplaintiff came closer to the junction, the traffic light changed to green and she picked\n\nup speed to enter the junction.4. As she approached the junction, the\n\nplaintiff noticed pick-up JFE 9877 (driven by the defendant) coming from the opposite\n\ndirection and occupying the turning lane, also entering the junction. It was slowing down\n\nas if to make a right turn. The plaintiff flicked her high beam and pressed the horn. This\n\nwas her usual practice when crossing a junction with on-coming turning traffic. She\n\ncontinued to move forward as she saw no reason to slow down and she had the right of way.\n\nShe was travelling in the centre lane at a speed of about 40 kmph.5. When the plaintiff was about to reach\n\nthe centre of the junction, the traffic light was still green in her favour. Suddenly, she\n\nrealised that the pick-up was accelerating and the next moment it collided onto the right\n\nside of her motorcycle. She did not have time to slow down or evade it.6. Under cross-examination, the plaintiff\n\nsaid that when she first saw the defendant, he was 20 metres away from her and that at\n\nthat time, her traffic light was green. As she entered the junction, she saw the pick-up\n\nmoving slowly and she was able to see it all the time that she was traversing the\n\njunction. She did not slow down or take any evasive action because she expected the\n\ndefendant to stop. She denied that she had failed to exhibit due regard for her own safety\n\nas she crossed the junction. She reasserted that she had sounded her horn and high beamed\n\nas she entered the junction to let on-coming traffic know that she was passing through.7. The plaintiff agreed that despite the\n\nfact that she had sounded her horn and flashed her high beam, the defendant had not\n\nstopped his vehicle. Instead he had moved faster. She reiterated that he was moving very\n\nslowly at first and she thought he would stop but just when he was near her, he sped up\n\ntrying to overtake her from the front and she was caught by surprise.",
        "The defendant’s version": "8. In his affidavit, the defendant stated\n\nthat at the material time, he was travelling along East Coast Road from Bedok. As he\n\nreached the junction of East Coast Road and Still Road, he intended to turn right into\n\nStill Road and therefore joined the queue of vehicles waiting to turn right at the\n\njunction. There were about five vehicles ahead of him in the queue.9. The cars ahead of him had turned right\n\ninto Still Road without incident even though the green arrow for them to turn right was\n\nnot showing. As he reached ahead of the queue to turn right, he noticed the\n\nplaintiff’s motorcycle on the other side of East Coast Road heading towards Bedok.\n\nShe was about ten car lengths away from him and was travelling at a fast speed. It was at\n\nthis time that the green arrow for him to turn right came on and he thus turned right into\n\nStill Road. As the defendant turned right, the plaintiff’s motorcycle collided into\n\nhis pick-up.10. The defendant went on to state that he\n\nverily believed that the plaintiff had ignored the red light that ought to have been\n\nshowing to her and had sped across the junction which resulted in her being flung some\n\ndistance away from the point of collision. He did not hear the plaintiff sounding the\n\nmotorcycle horn, neither did he see her flashing the lights of her motorcycle.11. The defendant referred to the report\n\nof the accident which he had made on the same day as he wished to clarify a discrepancy in\n\nthe report. He stated that his version of events was as stated in the affidavit as the\n\nroad names in the report were not accurate. The report was written in English by a traffic\n\npolice officer and the discrepancy may have occurred as a result of some miscommunication\n\nin the translation.12. After the accident, the defendant was\n\ncharged with an offence of inconsiderate driving. He explained that he had pleaded guilty\n\nto this charge as he had been told that the maximum fine for pleading guilty was $1,000.\n\nFor him it was cheaper to plead guilty than to engage a lawyer to defend him. He is a\n\nMalaysian and he did this purely out of convenience.",
        "Other evidence": "13. Each of the parties had a second\n\nwitness. The plaintiff called Staff Sergeant Govindharajoo R. who is attached to the\n\nTraffic Investigation Branch. Sergeant Govindharajoo testified that he had been assigned\n\nto investigate this accident and he had arrived at the scene at about 8.55pm on 18 July\n\nand inspected it. He found the front right side of the pick-up to be damaged and the right\n\nside of the motorcycle to be damaged.14. Sergeant Govindharajoo did not find\n\nany brake marks, skid marks, blood stains, or remnants of broken parts of either vehicle\n\nat the site of the accident.15. Sergeant Govindharajoo interviewed\n\nboth the plaintiff and the defendant. He took a formal statement from the defendant at the\n\npolice station. The defendant and his friend, Mr Soh Tien Chye, were present at the\n\ninterview and Mr Soh acted as translator.16. At the conclusion of the police\n\ninvestigation, action was taken against the defendant. He was charged under s 65 of the\n\nRoad Traffic Act (Cap 276) for driving JFE 9877 without due consideration, to wit for\n\nfailing to give way to the plaintiff when crossing the line of traffic. The defendant\n\npleaded guilty to the charge on 21 October 1999 and was fined $1,000 and disqualified from\n\ndriving for three months.17. In court, the sergeant was asked why\n\nhe had charged the defendant and not the plaintiff. His explanation was that an offence\n\nhad been disclosed and the defendant had admitted to the commission of the offence. The\n\nsergeant then pointed to para 2 of the defendant’s statement to him where the\n\ndefendant had stated that the traffic light was still green and he felt he was safe and he\n\nexecuted the right turn and the collision occurred. The sergeant maintained that Mr Soh\n\nhad been in the interview room throughout and had acted as interpreter. He denied that he\n\nhad taken the statement from the defendant by speaking to him in Malay and had only asked\n\nMr Soh to translate the completed statement.18. The defendant called Mr Soh. Mr Soh\n\ntestified that he had waited outside the interview room, at Sergeant Govindharajoo’s\n\ndirection, whilst the defendant was interrogated by the investigating officer. He could\n\nnot hear what they were saying. Finally, the sergeant told him to enter the room. He then\n\nsaw the statement written in English. The defendant could not understand it so Mr Soh\n\ntranslated it to him and then signed the statement as interpreter.19. Under cross-examination, Mr Soh said\n\nthat he had spoken to the defendant in Hokkien regarding the statement. The defendant had\n\nunderstood what he had said in Hokkien. After he explained the statement, the defendant\n\ndid not make any comment or ask any question and he signed the statement without\n\nobjection. I asked him whether the defendant had asked for any corrections to be made to\n\nthe statement. Mr Soh’s reply was ‘[the defendant] told me that the part about\n\nthe traffic light going to turn colour when amber turned to arrow, Rajoo did not mention\n\nthis in the statement’.20. In answer to a question as to what he\n\nhad done next, Mr Soh stated that he had mentioned the matter to Sergeant Govindharajoo\n\nwho had said that the statement was just a statement and that he needed to investigate the\n\nwhole case. He confirmed that the defendant had then signed the statement and that he\n\nhimself had not asked Sergeant Govindharajoo to change the statement. In re-examination,\n\nMr Soh said he had not translated the statement line by line to the defendant but had\n\nsummarised it.",
        "Reasoning": "21. I accepted the plaintiff’s\n\nsubmission that her version of the accident was to be preferred to that given by the\n\ndefendant. The plaintiff herself was a clear and calm witness. She did not contradict\n\nherself and was able to give a coherent account of what had happened.22. There was independent evidence which\n\nsupported the plaintiff’s account. She asserted that the front of the\n\ndefendant’s pick-up collided into the side of the motorcycle. The damage report\n\nproduced by the police showed that only the right side of the motorcycle had sustained\n\ndamage. Its front was unmarked. The defendant’s account was that the front of the\n\nmotorcycle had collided onto the front corner of his pick-up. If that had happened, then\n\nthe front of the motorcycle would have shown some sign of the impact. The damage report\n\ntherefore was consistent with the plaintiff’s account.23. Secondly, the plaintiff said that she\n\nwas travelling at 40 kmph whereas the defendant asserted that she was travelling\n\n‘fast’. The traffic police did not find any debris or any marks on the road\n\nsurface which would have suggested a violent collision. Further, if she had been\n\ntravelling fast, then the impact would have been greater and the motorcycle and pick-up\n\nwould have suffered greater damage than they in fact did. In respect of the motorcycle,\n\nonly the exhaust and brake pedal were dented and the rear signal casing was missing,\n\nwhilst the front cover of the pick-up’s right hand signal light was cracked and the\n\nright corner of its front bumper was dented. This damage was not consistent with a violent\n\ncollision.24. The defendant’s evidence as to\n\nthe manner of the collision was not only inconsistent with the physical evidence, it was\n\nalso inconsistent with his own original account of the accident. In the police report\n\nwhich he made a few hours after the accident, he had indicated by a tick against the\n\nappropriate box, that the collision had been a head to side one. When he was asked why he\n\nhad ticked that box if the collision had actually been a front to front one, he claimed\n\nthat he had no knowledge of how the tick had been made as it had been done by Mr Soh. Mr\n\nSoh’s evidence was, however, that he had had no involvement with the reporting of the\n\ntraffic accident and that the defendant had spoken in Malay to the Malay police officer\n\nwho took down the report.25. The most important dispute of fact in\n\nthe case was the state of the traffic lights at the time of the accident. I found that the\n\nplaintiff had been telling the truth when she asserted that the light was green in her\n\nfavour and that the defendant was untruthful in maintaining that the green arrow had come\n\non and that there was a red light against the plaintiff.26. The plaintiff gave a clear account of\n\nthe position. Her evidence on this point was not shaken at all. It was maintained from, at\n\nleast, the time of her police report made about a month after the accident, right through\n\nthe proceedings and up till the time she came to court. The defendant, on the other hand,\n\nchanged his story. He made no mention of the state of the traffic lights in his police\n\nreport on the night of the accident. A short time later, in the statement which he made to\n\nSergeant Govindharajoo, he stated that the light was still showing green at the time that\n\nhe had tried to turn right into Still Road. When he appeared in court to answer the charge\n\nof inconsiderate driving, he did not dispute the charge that he had been inconsiderate\n\nbecause he had failed to give way to the plaintiff’s motorcycle. It was only when the\n\namended defence was filed in this action on 20 June 2000 that the defendant asserted that\n\nthere had been a red light against the plaintiff.27. I did not believe the defendant’s\n\nnew story. If indeed the red light had been showing against the plaintiff, it would have\n\nbeen only natural for him to have said so immediately after the accident. Instead, he not\n\nonly made no mention of it in his police report but in his statement to the investigating\n\nofficer, he actually stated the opposite, ie, that the light was green. When I questioned\n\nhim as to whom he held responsible for the accident, his reply was that there was no one\n\nhe would want to blame for an accident like that, it was only hard luck. I then asked him\n\nwhether he did not blame the plaintiff. This time he replied no, he did not blame anybody,\n\nwho could he blame for an accident like that. It was then suggested that he could blame\n\nthe plaintiff. The defendant evaded giving a direct answer saying that nobody would want\n\nto get involved in an accident and he supposed that it would be the traffic police who\n\ncould say who was at fault. It was only when he was asked whether it had been wrong of the\n\nplaintiff to go through a red light as he had alleged she had, that the defendant rather\n\nreluctantly ascribed blame to the plaintiff, by saying that if the condition of the lights\n\nat that time were taken into account she was at fault. I found this reluctance on the part\n\nof the defendant to hold the plaintiff even partly responsible for the accident to be\n\nrevealing. It indicated, to say the least, an awareness of wrong-doing on his part.28. Secondly, I found Sergeant\n\nGovindharajoo’s evidence to be more believable than that of Mr Soh on the way in\n\nwhich the statement was recorded. The sergeant was the investigating officer. He was a\n\nneutral party. He had no reason to lie. On the other hand, Mr Soh was the defendant’s\n\nemployer and friend and was concerned to help the defendant.29. Even if one accepts that Mr Soh was\n\nnot in the interrogation room whilst the statement was being recorded, his evidence was\n\nnot completely helpful to the defendant. During cross-examination, he admitted that after\n\nhe had interpreted the statement to the defendant, the latter had understood the\n\ninterpretation and had not asked any questions or made any comments. Later, the witness\n\nattempted to ameliorate the effect of the foregoing evidence by adding that the defendant\n\nhad informed him that green arrow had come on allowing the defendant to proceed and that\n\nhe had conveyed this information to the police officer who had not changed the statement.\n\nThe fact remains, however, that no good reason was given as to why the officer ignored\n\nthis additional information or why the defendant proceeded to sign the statement when both\n\nhe and Mr Soh would have been aware that a vital piece of information was missing and, in\n\nfact, the statement was wrong on the condition of the traffic lights.30. The defendant’s explanations for\n\nhis omission to state early in the day that the traffic light was red against the\n\nplaintiff are difficult to accept. In regard to the police report that he made before\n\nseeing Sergeant Govindharajoo, he had a chance before making it to confer with Mr Soh.\n\nDespite that, he did not make any reference to seeing the amber light or the green arrow.\n\nIn reply to the question as to why he had omitted to mention these facts, the defendant\n\nsaid that he was nervous. The plaintiff submitted that that was a lame excuse because\n\nafter the accident the defendant had been calm enough to drive to Mr Soh’s house and\n\nthen to drive the both of them to the traffic police headquarters. Further, had he been\n\nnervous, he would have turned to Mr Soh for help in making the report, which he did not. I\n\naccepted this submission.31. The defendant went on to make and sign\n\na statement recorded in the course of investigation by the traffic police. He had known\n\nbeforehand that he might require bail and this was one reason he had asked Mr Soh to\n\naccompany him to the police station. He therefore must have known that he had to give the\n\ninvestigating officer an adequate explanation as otherwise he might be charged with a\n\ntraffic offence. In any event, there was a warning to him that he was bound to state the\n\ntrue facts. Yet he went on to make a statement in which he admitted that the traffic light\n\nwas green when he made a right turn and that he had thought it was safe for him to cross\n\neven though he had seen the plaintiff coming.32. Having been charged with the offence\n\nof inconsiderate driving as a result of this statement, he pleaded guilty though he must\n\nhave known then that he could have contested the charge with the help of Mr Soh’s\n\nevidence to set aside the statement. That he did not do so and never raised the red light\n\nuntil the amended defence was filed some two weeks after his original defence which made\n\nno mention of the red light, were two more facts that confirmed me in my view that the\n\ndefendant had been lying to me about the condition of the lights at the time of the\n\naccident.33. I was satisfied that the plaintiff had\n\nthe right of way and that it was the defendant who had wrongfully driven into her path and\n\nthus been the primary cause of the subsequent collision. The defendant contended that,\n\nnevertheless, the plaintiff had to share some blame for the accident because she had not\n\nhad sufficient regard for her own safety. He submitted that it was clear from the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence that she had seen him as she approached the junction and was\n\naware that he was moving into the turn. That being the case, she should have take steps to\n\navoid the collision by, for example, changing lane or slowing down.34. The plaintiff’s rejoinder was\n\nthat whilst she saw the defendant moving slowly towards her, she considered that he would\n\nstop before crossing her path and that it was only because he suddenly accelerated as she\n\napproached that the collision occurred. By then there was no time to avoid the accident.\n\nThe defendant himself testified that as he saw the plaintiff approach him, he stepped on\n\nhis brake in order to stop his vehicle. He did not jam on the brakes because he was\n\nconcerned about the consequences of a sudden halt on his pregnant wife and young son who\n\nwere in the pick-up with him. Thus, having stepped on the brake, he then released it and\n\nthe pick-up did not come to a complete halt. Instead it moved forward. If the defendant\n\nwas concerned about injuring his family by bringing his vehicle to a sudden and complete\n\nstop, he must have been travelling faster than he would admit. I accepted the\n\nplaintiff’s evidence that instead of stopping, most probably the defendant picked up\n\nspeed just before the accident, thus coming into her path. I therefore found that the\n\nplaintiff had no time to take any evasive action and that she had not been negligent in\n\nmaintaining her course despite being aware of the presence and movements of the defendant.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
