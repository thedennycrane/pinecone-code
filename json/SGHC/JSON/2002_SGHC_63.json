        "The affidavits": "4. Three (3) affidavits were filed in relation to the application, two\n\n(2) by the respondents and one (1) by the appellant's solicitor; the appellant himself did\n\nnot file any affidavit. In their joint affidavit filed with the application, the\n\nrespondents deposed to the following facts:(i) the appellant resides in Petaling Jaya, Selangor, West Malaysia and\n\n  had so informed Prakash J at the trial of the OS;(ii) the appellant was a beneficiary (of 1/9 share) of the estate of\n\n  the deceased under the terms of her Will dated 18 October 1991;(iii) in matters relating to the estate of the deceased, they had\n\n  communicated with the appellant through his Singapore solicitors Allen & Gledhill;(iv) on 3 January 2002, their solicitors had written to David Chong\n\n  & Company, the appellant's solicitors acting for him in the OS and the Appeal,\n\n  requesting additional security (of $40,000) which request the appellant refused by way of\n\n  his said solicitors' letter dated 4 January 2002;(v) the appellant had failed to any of the judgment sums ordered by\n\n  Prakash J despite several demands.5. In a subsequent affidavit filed only by one of the respondents\n\nnamely Carol Lim, she deposed to the following additional facts:(i) no distribution had yet been made to any of the beneficiaries of\n\n  the estate because the respondents were still in the process of ascertaining the tax\n\n  obligations/liabilities of the deceased in the United States;(ii) if the tax issue in the United States was resolved favourably, it\n\n  would mean that the estate could distribute about S$3m to each of the residuary legatees;(iii) the appellant had been extremely uncooperative with the\n\n  respondents as, he had sought to evade service of process of enforcement proceedings\n\n  against him and had failed to abide by the order of Prakash J to provide information\n\n  relating to the monies she had ordered him to return to the estate in particular on the\n\n  sum of $5.3m;(iv) if interest (or notional interest at 6% per annum) was computed on\n\n  the sum of $5.3m with effect from 14 December 1994 as per the judgment of Prakash J, the\n\n  amount as at the date of judgment exceeded $2.2m;(v) the interest on the other judgment sum of $251,347 at 6% per annum\n\n  (for the same period) exceeded $100,000;(vi) taking into account the interest element, the total sums owed by\n\n  the appellant to the estate exceeded $7,866,000.(vii) apart from his beneficiary interest in the estate, the appellant\n\n  had disposed of all his other assets within the jurisdiction.6. As earlier stated, the appellant did not file any affidavit to\n\noppose the application or to challenge the allegations made by the respondents in their\n\naffidavits. Instead, his solicitor (Morris Yow) filed an affidavit wherein he merely\n\nexhibited a statutory notice of demand (under the Bankruptcy Act) dated 29 January 2002\n\nissued to the appellant by the respondents' solicitors, claiming the sum of $5,566,408.80\n\n(the three [3] judgment sums). Morris Yow also exhibited copies of, the last Will of the\n\ndeceased as well as the Grant of Probate for the estate showing that the net worth of the\n\nestate (less estate duty paid) is in excess of $25m; he made no reference to either\n\naffidavit filed by the respondents.7. A the hearing, Morris Yow confirmed that the appellant had not filed\n\nany application for nor had he obtained, a stay of execution on the judgment of Prakash J\n\npending the Appeal. It is trite law that the filing of a notice of appeal does not operate\n\nautomatically as a stay of execution on a judgment, pending hearing of the appeal. No\n\naffidavit was filed by or for the appellant to explain why he did not or could not pay any\n\npart of the judgment debt which sums were very substantial. His counsel did not deny that\n\nthe appellant was ordinarily resident outside jurisdiction; indeed, he is a Malaysian\n\ncitizen according to his particulars as stated in the OS.8. It is equally trite law that a judgment creditor should not be\n\ndeprived of the fruits of his judgment, where no stay of execution was granted. I had\n\nnoted from Prakash J's judgment that essentially she disbelieved the appellant's claim\n\nthat the deceased had made him a gift of the $5.3m he had taken from her funds during her\n\nlifetime. The other two (2) judgment sums were the remaining funds in a joint bank account\n\nthe appellant operated with the deceased during her lifetime. Essentially, the appellant\n\ngave me no grounds to exercise my discretion in his favour not to order payment of the\n\njudgment sums (which I understood he could well afford to pay) pending the Appeal. Even\n\nso, I did exercise my discretion and declined to order him to pay the first and the\n\nlargest, judgment sum of $5.3m. If the Court of Appeal allowed his appeal and reversed the\n\njudgment of Prakash J, it meant the sum was indeed a gift to him from his maternal aunt.\n\nConsequently, I did not order him to pay that amount. There was however no reason not to\n\norder the appellant to pay the other two (2) judgment sums.9. Finally, counsel for the respondents informed me that the costs for a day's hearing\n\nin the Court of Appeal far exceeded the security for costs of $10,000 which was required\n\nto be lodged with every notice of appeal. She estimated that the costs could range from\n\n$35,000 to $60,000. Accordingly, I ordered the appellant to furnish an additional sum of\n\n$25,000 by way of security for the costs of the Appeal.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright Â© Government of Singapore."
