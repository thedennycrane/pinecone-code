        "Section 47(3) Banking Act (Cap 19) 1994 Edition": "7.    The previous s 47(3) Banking Act (‘the Act’) stated:‘(3) Subject to subsection (4), no official of any bank and no\n\n  person who by reason of his capacity or office has by any means access to the records of\n\n  the bank, registers or any correspondence or material with regard to the account of any\n\n  customer of that bank shall, while his employment in or professional relationship with the\n\n  bank, as the case may be, continues or after the termination thereof, give, divulge or\n\n  reveal any informationwhatsoever regarding the money or other relevant particulars of\n\n  the accountof that customer.’[Emphasis added.]8.    Various exceptions were set out in subsection (4) but I need not\n\nrefer to them.",
        "Current Section 47 Banking Act (Cap 19)": "9.    The previous s 47 was repealed and substituted by the current s 47\n\nwith effect from 18 July 2001. The banking secrecy provision is now spread over two\n\nsubsections instead of one. The relevant provisions are s 47(1) to (2). There is also\n\nanother provision i.e s 47(3) on the court’s power to give directions or orders to\n\nensure confidentiality.10.    Section 47(1) to (3) state:‘Banking secrecy47. (1) Customer information shall not, in any way, be disclosed by\n\n  a bank in Singapore or any of its officers to any other person except as expressly\n\n  provided in this Act.(2) A bank in Singapore or any of its officers may, for such purpose as\n\n  may be specified in the first column of the Sixth Schedule, disclose customer information\n\n  to such persons or class of persons as may be specified in the second column of that\n\n  Schedule, and in compliance with such conditions as may be specified in the third column\n\n  of that Schedule.(3) Where customer information is likely to be disclosed in any\n\n  proceedings referred to in item 3 or 4 of Part I of the Sixth Schedule, the court may,\n\n  either of its own motion, or on the application of any party to the proceedings or the\n\n  customer to which the customer information relates(a) direct that the proceedings be held in camera; and(b) make such further orders as it may consider necessary to ensure the\n\n    confidentiality of the customer information.’11.    As is evident, exceptions to banking secrecy are stated in the\n\nfirst column of the Sixth Schedule to the Act. For present purposes, I need refer only to\n\nitems 3 and 4 thereof which state:‘SIXTH SCHEDULEPART IFURTHER DISCLOSURE NOT PROHIBITEDFirst columnPurpose for which customer information may be disclosed3. Disclosure is solely in connection with -(a) where the customer is an individual, the bankruptcy of the\n\n    customer; or(b) where the customer is a body corporate, the winding up of the\n\n    customer.4. Disclosure is solely with a view to the institution of, or solely in\n\n  connection with, the conduct of proceedings-(a) between the bank and the customer or his surety relating to the\n\n    banking transaction of the customer;(b) between the bank and 2 or more parties making adverse claims to\n\n    money in an account of the customer where the bank seeks relief by way of interpleader; or(c) between the bank and one or more parties in respect of property,\n\n    whether movable or immovable, in or over which some right or interest has been conferred\n\n    or alleged to have been conferred on the bank by the customer or his surety.’12.    In addition, ‘customer information’ in s 47 is defined\n\nin s 40A as follows:‘ \"customer information\", in relation to a bank, means(a) any informationrelating to, or any particulars of, an\n\n    account of a customer of the bank, whether the account is in respect of a loan, investment\n\n    or any other type of transaction, but does not include any information that is not\n\n    referable to any named customer or group of named customers; or(b) deposit information;’[Emphasis added.]There is a definition of ‘deposit information’ also but that\n\nis not relevant for present purposes.",
        "Submission for PSA": "13.    Mr Siraj Omar, Counsel for PSA, submitted that under the\n\npredecessor to s 47, the prohibition from disclosure of information was restricted only to\n\nthe money in the account of the customer and particulars of the account. In other words,\n\nother information was not precluded from disclosure by a bank. He derived support from\n\nsome textbooks.14.    For example, International Bank Secrecy, 1992, by Dennis Campbell\n\nstates at para 31-027:‘Subject matter of statutory dutySection 47 prohibits those concerned from giving, divulging, or\n\n  revealing \"any information whatsoever regarding the money or other relevant\n\n  particulars of the account of [the bank’s] customer\". It will be noticed that a\n\n  moratorium is imposed on \"any information whatsoever\", that relates to:(1) The money in the customer’s account, or(2) Relevant particulars of the account.It would appear that an omission has been made in respect of the\n\n  affairs of the customer other than the money in, or relevant particulars, of the account.\n\n  The situation inTournier, for example, would apparently fall outside the wording\n\n  of section 47 as the information divulged in that case was that the banks’ customer\n\n  had diverted the proceeds of a check to his bookmaker. This neither relates to the money\n\n  in his account, nor is it a particular of his account.’15.    Another textbook which he relied on was Bank Confidentiality by\n\nFrancis Neate, Second Edition 1997, at p 442:‘Subject matter of statutory dutyThe prohibited matter under BA, s 47(3) relates to the balance\n\n  in the customer’s account and other relevant particulars of the account of the\n\n  customer. InTournier, the bank had made disclosure to a third party of the fact\n\n  that the customer had diverted the proceeds of a cheque to a bookmaker. Since such\n\n  information neither relates to the money in the customer’s account nor is it a\n\n  particular of his account, this raises the issue of whether the bank would have been held\n\n  to have breached its statutory duty of confidentiality in Singapore even though it may\n\n  have breached its contractual duty at common law, which is framed more widely.’16.    However the next two paras state:‘ This is a (sic) possibly anomaly, which unfortunately has\n\n  also not come before the courts. Although it is appreciated that the argument made above\n\n  that s 47 is not intended to be exhaustive, it is submitted here that the narrower wording\n\n  of s 47(3) should be followed, on the principle of statutory interpretation that a penal\n\n  statute be narrowly construed.It should be noted that the Malaysian statutory duty does not have this\n\n  anomaly, because their equivalent provision prohibits the disclosure of ‘any\n\n  information or document whatsoever relating to the affairs or account’ of a\n\n  customer.’17.    Mr Omar submitted that there was no radical departure from this\n\nregime when the predecessor Act was repealed and the new Act came into force because no\n\nsuch departure was suggested when Deputy Prime Minister Brigadier-General Lee Hsien Loong\n\n(‘DPM’) moved the reading of the Banking (Amendment) Bill. DPM said, inter alia,‘Revision of Banking Secrecy ProvisionsThe banking secrecy provisions of the Banking Act protect the\n\n  confidentiality of customer information. Tight banking secrecy is important to maintaining\n\n  the confidence of customers in our banking system. However, our present banking secrecy\n\n  provisions have impeded banks wanting to take advantage of potential operational benefits\n\n  and savings. For example, banks find it difficult to securitise mortgage loans, or to\n\n  outsource data processing to third parties. MAS has reviewed the banking secrecy\n\n  provisions in consultation with the industry. We have considered both the operational\n\n  requirements of banks and the need to preserve customer confidentiality. The measures set\n\n  out in the new section 47 strike a careful balance between these two sets of\n\n  considerations.The new section 47 will stipulate a wider set of circumstances under\n\n  which banks can disclose customer information, and the terms of such disclosure. These are\n\n  set out in a new Sixth Schedule, which consists of two parts. Part I will contain many of\n\n  the existing exceptions, and Part II will contain most of the new exceptions to the\n\n  secrecy provisions. Examples of new exceptions are the disclosure of credit information in\n\n  a sale or transfer of credit facilities (for example, asset securitisation), and the\n\n  disclosure of customer information to a bank’s head office for risk management\n\n  purposes. Two key points about the new exceptions are, first, only very few exceptions\n\n  have been allowed for the disclosure of information relating to a customer’s deposit\n\n  and funds placed for investment; and second, a person who receives customer information\n\n  will be required by law to keep the information confidential.These measures ensure that by law, all banks will provide a basic level\n\n  of customer confidentiality to all their customers. Beyond this legal minimum, individual\n\n  banks and customers may reach their own contractual arrangements offering higher standards\n\n  of confidentiality. The Act does not compel a bank to invoke the newly introduced\n\n  exceptions if the bank deems this to be in the best interests of its business and its\n\n  customers.’18.    Mr Omar submitted that since the category of documents for which\n\nPSA sought discovery did not pertain to money in the account of KEB’s customers,\n\nwhether it be CY Singapore or CY Korea, or particulars of the account as such, KEB was not\n\nprohibited from disclosing the same under s 47 of the current Banking Act. In addition, if\n\nany document disclosed would reveal any prohibited information which was not relevant to\n\nthe action, portions of the document could be blanked out.19.    Finally he submitted that it was anomalous to allow one category\n\nof documents to be disclosed and not another.",
        "Submission for KEB": "20.    Mr Toh Kian Sing, Counsel for KEB, stressed that it was common\n\nground that the exceptions in the Sixth Schedule did not apply. The question was whether\n\nthe prohibition in s 47 was as limited as advocated by Mr Omar or the prohibition was\n\nwider. He submitted that as the definition of ‘customer information’ was wider\n\nthan the words in the previous s 47(3), the prohibition was wider.21.    As for the current s 47(3), Mr Toh submitted that the court can\n\nmake such orders as it may consider necessary to ensure the confidentiality of the\n\ncustomer information only if the proceedings come within item 3 or 4 of Part I of the\n\nSixth Schedule in the first place.",
        "My Decision": "22.    DPM’s speech in Parliament did not indicate whether a change\n\nwas intended on the point in issue before me.23.    I was of the view that whether a change was intended or not, the\n\nscheme under the current s 47 was to have a general, as opposed to a limited, prohibition\n\nfrom disclosure with the exceptions stated in the Sixth Schedule.24.    I came to this conclusion from the wider words used to define\n\n‘customer information’ as well as the speech of DPM.25.    Firstly, as I have set out, ‘customer information’\n\nmeans ‘any informationrelating to… an account of a customer of the\n\nbank’ [emphasis added]. True, the definition is not in the same terms as the\n\nMalaysian statutory duty mentioned in Bank Confidentiality by Francis Neate i.e where the\n\nprovision prohibits disclosure of ‘any informationor document whatsoeverrelating to theaffairsor account’ of a customer [emphasis added]. However, I\n\nwas of the view that the omission of the words I have emphasized do not mean that the\n\nprohibition is as limited as was argued by Mr Omar. In my view, ‘information’\n\nincludes documentary information and so long as the information sought relates to an\n\naccount of a customer, then, prima facie disclosure by the bank is prohibited.26.    Secondly, the speech by DPM reflects the scheme that there should\n\nfirst be a general prohibition from disclosure by banks to ensure confidentiality. This is\n\nthen subject to exceptions stated in the Sixth Schedule. If any further exception is to be\n\nmade, then this should be done by amending the Sixth Schedule and not by narrowly\n\nconstruing ‘customer information’.27.    On the facts before me, the second category of documents related\n\nto the account of KEB’s customer or customers.28.    I also agreed that under the current s 47(3), the question of the\n\ncourt making such further orders as are necessary to preserve confidentiality comes into\n\nplay only if item 3 or 4 of the Sixth Schedule apply. The current s 47(3) does not enable\n\na court to order disclosure from a bank if none of the exceptions apply in the first\n\nplace.29.    It may well be that the present case calls for further amendments\n\nto be made to the Act to include an exception which allows disclosure in litigation\n\nbetween a bank and the beneficiary of an instrument issued by the bank. Indeed, there are\n\nmany instances of banks issuing instruments like guarantees, performance bonds and letters\n\nof credit. It seems to be incongruous that where there is litigation between, say, a bank\n\nand a surety relating to the banking transaction of a customer, discovery of relevant\n\ndocuments pertaining to ‘customer information’ is allowed but yet where a\n\nbeneficiary sues a bank on any of the instruments I have mentioned, such disclosure is not\n\nallowed. Since the dispute between the beneficiary and the bank relates to an instrument\n\nwhich must have been issued at the request of the customer, the customer should not be in\n\na position to complain if information relating to his account is disclosed so long as it\n\nsatisfies the test of relevance in the litigation. In addition, the current s 47(3) can be\n\nexpanded to allow the court to make such directions and orders it thinks fit to ensure\n\nconfidentiality where this exception, if available, applies.30.    As an aside, it seems to me that the current s 47(3) is too\n\nnarrow in that it should not be confined to items 3 and 4. This is because there are other\n\nexceptions which may require the court’s assistance to ensure confidentiality, for\n\nexample, items 6 and 7 of the Sixth Schedule which pertain respectively to garnishee\n\nproceedings and a court order pursuant to Part IV of the Evidence Act.31.    However, it is for Parliament to decide whether any further\n\nexception to banking secrecy or confidentiality is required and whether the current s\n\n47(3) should be expanded.32.    As for the argument that it would be anomalous to allow one\n\ncategory of documents to be disclosed and not another, I accepted that there was some\n\nforce in that argument. It seemed to me that either both categories should have been\n\ndisclosed or not at all. However, that was the decision below and there was no appeal by\n\nKEB.33.    In the circumstances, I dismissed PSA’s appeal with costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
