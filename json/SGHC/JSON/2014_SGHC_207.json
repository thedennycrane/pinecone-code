        "Background": "9       The\nProperty was purchased in cash by Father in June 1979 and registered\nin Father’s sole name. The Property had been the family home since\nits purchase though, at the time of the proceedings, only Mother\nand a helper lived in the Property. The four children, all of whom\nare married, moved out of the Property at different times. The last\nof them to move out was Dawood in November 2011. 10     Father\nsuffered a stroke sometime between 1989 and 1993 (the date was disputed\nbut nothing turns on this) and was bedridden until he passed away\nin March 2000. Jahir and Dawood both took on the fatherly role in\nthe household in maintaining the family, the home and Father’s business\nfrom the time Father became bedridden. 11     Father’s\nbusiness in question is the sale of mutton at a stall in Tekka market.\nAt that time, it was the sole source of income for the family. Jahir helped\nwith the running of the business even before Father became ill, whereupon\nJahir took over the running of the business and Dawood came on board\nto assist Jahir. It was agreed between all the parties that Jahir\nwas the successor of the mutton stall business. 12     Dawood\nwas then a first-year student studying accountancy at the Nanyang\nTechnological University (NTU). He suspended his studies to help\nout with the mutton stall business which appeared to be facing some financial\ndifficulty. He stopped helping with the business sometime in 1996 but\nhe did not return to NTU to complete his studies. Instead, he enrolled as\na cadet with Singapore Airlines (SIA) and eventually became a pilot.\nHe is still a pilot with SIA. 13     The\nonly family members who were living at the Property after 2001 were\nDawood and Mother. Everyone else had moved out by then. Noorjahan\nmoved out around 1992, Aysha in 1996, and Jahir in 2001. The Property\nwas still in Father’s name in 2001 even though he had passed away close\nto a year ago.",
        "The Inheritance Certificates": "14     The\nfirst attempt to administer Father’s estate came about four months\nafter the demise of Father, in July 2000. Dawood wrote to the Syariah\ncourt on 13 July 2000 seeking what is known as a Certificate of Inheritance.\nThe certificate was issued on 21 July 2000 (“the 1st Inheritance Certificate”).\nCuriously, it named Mother and himself as the only beneficiaries\nof Father’s estate. 15     The\n1st Inheritance Certificate only surfaced in the course of cross-examination.\nIt was produced by Dawood in response to a question by the counsel\nfor the Plaintiffs, Mr Bernard Sahagar (“Mr Sahagar”). But it was quickly\nascertained and agreed to by all sides that the 1st Inheritance Certificate\nwas erroneous. The Plaintiff Siblings were excluded under the 1st\nInheritance Certificate because their names were omitted in the\nanswer provided by Dawood to the staff officer who had asked who\nwas living at the Property at the time the request was made for\nthe 1st Certificate of Inheritance. Whatever the case, because the\nparties agreed that the 1st Inheritance Certificate had no evidential\nvalue, and that it was the later Inheritance Certificate obtained\non 24 February 2004 (“the 2nd Inheritance Certificate”) that was\nmaterial, I did not think it was necessary to give any weight to\nthe 1st Inheritance Certificate. 16     The\n2nd Inheritance Certificate was obtained by Dawood (see [18] below),\nbut this time as the properly appointed administrator of Father’s estate.\nHe was appointed by the Plaintiffs sometime in early 2004 (certainly before\nFebruary 2004). There was some dispute as to why the family decided\nto appoint an administrator in 2004 when nothing had been done foralmost four yearsafter Father’s death. 17     Again,\nthis difference was immaterial to the outcome as the Plaintiffs had\nagreed that Dawood was to be appointed as administrator by the family to\nhandle the administration of father’s estate. That was not in dispute. Specifically,\nthe Plaintiffs also agreed that Dawood was authorised to consult\nsolicitors, that, after such consultation, he had reported to the family\nthat they needed to apply for letters of administration, and that Dawood\nwas authorised to apply for letters of administration on behalf\nof the family. 18     Dated\n24 February 2004, the application for the 2nd Inheritance Certificate\nwas not made by Dawood but by Messrs Harjeet Singh & Co, the firm\nof solicitors engaged by Dawood. The lawyers who dealt with Dawood were\nMr Harjeet Singh and Ms Gurmeet Kaur (hereafter collectively referred\nto as “the Solicitors”). The Solicitors appeared as Dawood’s witnesses\nin these proceedings. 19     The\nbeneficiaries of Father’s estate and their respective entitlement were\nlisted under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate as follows: (a)     Jahir\n(son) – 14 shares (b)     Dawood\n(son) – 14 shares (c)     Mother\n– 6 shares (d)     Aysha\n(daughter) – 7 shares (e)     Noorjahan\n– 7 shares",
        "The Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement": "20     The\nPlaintiffs claimed that they (or at least Aysha and Noorjahan) were\nshocked at how little of Father’s estate Mother was entitled to\nunder the 2nd Inheritance Certificate. For the purposes of these\nproceedings, the parties’ interest in Father’s estate was limited\nto the Property. 21     The\nPlaintiffs further claimed that it was then suggested – and all family\nmembers agreed – that the four children would “defer” their interest in\nthe Property until Mother passed away (the “Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement”). 22     It\nwas not clear what that meant, legally. Nevertheless, it was clear,\non the Plaintiffs’ case, that the consequence of the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement was that the Property would be transferred into Mother’s\nsole name.",
        "Dawood’s 2004 Agreement": "23     Dawood,\nhowever, had his own version of an agreement that was vastly different\nfrom the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. In his version (“Dawood’s 2004\nAgreement”), Dawood asked all his siblings, in early January 2004,\nto gather at the Property to discuss the administration of Father’s\nestate. At this meeting, which was also attended by Mother, Dawood\ninformed the family that they needed to engage a lawyer to assist in\nthe application for letters of administration. The family agreed\nthat Dawood should be responsible for this. 24     Dawood\nclaimed that the family also agreed, at the same meeting, that the\nProperty should be registered in the joint names of Mother and him. Dawood\nsaid that the Plaintiffs agreed to this as he was the only unmarried child\nthen, and was also the only one living with Mother at that time.\nAs part of this agreement, Dawood would take care of Mother and\npay all household and related bills. There was also a suggestion\nthat this entire arrangement – the ownership of the Property and\ntaking care of Mother – was in line with Father’s wishes. I will\nreturn to this suggestion in due course (see [155] to [161] below).",
        "Transfer of the Property": "25     Leaving\naside for now whether and which of the two agreements reflected\nthe true situation, the Property was eventually transferred to and registered\nin Mother and Dawood’s names as joint tenants. This took place following\nthe execution of various documents. The principal documents relating\nto the transfer are: (a)     the\nDeed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest dated 27 February 2004\nunder which Jahir, Asyha and Noorjahan renounced all interest in\nthe Property in favour of Mother and Dawood; (b)     the\nTransmission Application No IUA 72518P dated 29 March 2005 for the\nProperty to be transmitted to Dawood as the sole administrator of\nFather’s estate; and (c)     the\nTransfer Document No IA 72519A dated 29 March 2005 and registered\non 15 April 2005 under which the Property was transferred from Dawood\nas the administrator to Mother and Dawood as joint tenants. 26     It\nappeared that the new certificate of title and the completed administration\npapers were returned by Messrs Harjeet Singh & Co to Dawood\nsometime in May 2005. 27     The\nPlaintiffs claimed that they were never given or shown the original\ncertificate of title.",
        "Discovery of the transfer": "28     The\nPlaintiffs claimed that they only discovered that the Property had been\ntransferred to Mother and Dawood as joint tenants sometime in the beginning\nof 2011; in other words, 11 years after the demise of Father, and almost\nsix years after Mother and Dawood became joint tenants of the Property.\nThis was prompted, the Plaintiffs said, by Mother’s request to see the\ntitle deed. Aysha then approached a friend who was a lawyer, one\nMr Ibrahim, who did a search of the land registry and informed her\nthat Mother and Dawood were joint tenants of the Property. 29     It\nwas not clear what immediate steps the Plaintiffs took after they found\nout about the joint tenancy from Mr Ibrahim. In any event, according\nto Aysha, Mr Ibrahim told her (when she subsequently approached\nhim for advice) that she should lodge a caveat. 30     Aysha\nthus suggested to Jahir and Noorjahan that they should lodge a caveat.\nThey agreed. 31     On\n15 November 2011, Mr Ibrahim filed a caveat on the Property on behalf\nof the Plaintiff Siblings (“the Caveat”). The Caveat alleged that Dawood,\nas the administrator of Father’s estate, had no right to gift the Property\nto himself and Mother to the exclusion of the interests of the caveators\n(that is, the Plaintiff Siblings). Although Mother was not listed\nas a caveator, there was no dispute that she was aware and had implicitly consented\nto the filing of the Caveat. 32     Dawood\nwas notified of the filing of the Caveat by way of a letter from the\nSingapore Land Authority (SLA) on 19 November 2011. However, he did\nnot take steps to set aside the Caveat. Dawood said that he spoke\nto Aysha and Jahir and asked them why they had lodged the Caveat\nbut they avoided giving him a proper answer. 33     Dawood\nsaid that he also asked Mother about the Caveat to which she said\nthat the Plaintiff Siblings “just wanted some money”. According\nto Dawood, Mother said she would talk to them.",
        "These proceedings": "34     On\n13 February 2013, the Plaintiffs instructed solicitors to issue\na letter of demand to Dawood alleging that he had breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004\nAgreement by registering the Property in the joint names of Mother and\nhim. The letter gave Dawood until 20 February 2013 to remove his name\nas a joint owner. 35     After\nan initial holding letter, Dawood’s solicitors responded on 14 March\n2013 denying the existence of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 36     Shortly\nthereafter, on 27 March 2013, the Plaintiffs commenced these proceedings.",
        "The pleadings": "",
        "The Plaintiffs’ pleadings": "37     In\nessence, the Plaintiffs claimed that by transferring the Property\nto Mother and himself as joint tenants “surreptitiously and/or in\nbad faith”, Dawood had breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement which\nwas an agreement between the four siblings to “waive all or any\ninterest in the estate, particularly in relation to the Property\nand name [Mother] as the sole legal and beneficial owner of the\nProperty”. 38     The\nPlaintiffs also challenged the “authenticity of the probate papers”, not\nso much that they were forged, but in the sense that irrespective\nof what the documents said, the Plaintiffs thought that the documents\nthat they had signed were for the purpose of giving effect to the\nPlaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 39     The\nPlaintiffs sought the following substantive reliefs: (a)     a\ndeclaration that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner of\nthe Property; (b)     a\ndeclaration that Dawood has no legal or beneficial interest in the\nProperty; (c)     Transfer\nDocument No IA 72519A dated 25 March 2009 and registered on 15 April\n2005 is null and void; and (d)     Dawood\nto deliver possession of all title deeds relating to the Property,\nsign all documents and deeds necessary to register Mother as the\nsole legal and beneficial owner of the Property.",
        "Dawood’s pleadings": "40     Dawood’s\nmain defence was that the Plaintiff Siblings had, under the Deed\nof Renunciation of Beneficial Interest, waived all of their legal\nand beneficial interests in Father’s estate in favour of Mother\nand himself. He claimed that their renunciation was in furtherance\nof Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. 41     Dawood\nalso claimed that to the extent that the Plaintiffs alleged that there\nwas an implied contract, that is, the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,\nthe cause of action arising from the registration of the Property\nwith Mother and Dawood as joint tenants accrued on 15 April 2005\n(see [25(c)] above). Pursuant to s 6 of the Limitation Act (Cap\n163, 1996 Rev Ed) – which limits the prosecution of contractual\nclaims to six years from the date on which the cause of action accrued\n– the Plaintiffs’ claim was therefore time-barred. 42     Thirdly,\nDawood counterclaimed that the Plaintiff Siblings’ lodgement of\nthe Caveat was wrongful, vexatious or without reasonable cause.\nDawood therefore sought damages for losses that he had incurred\nin relation to the lodgement of the Caveat, namely costs of obtaining\nlegal advice and costs associated with obtaining a copy of the Caveat. 43     If\nhowever the court found that the Plaintiff Siblings did have a legitimate\ninterest in the Property, Dawood counterclaimed for a declaration\nthat the Plaintiff Siblings are liable, in proportion to their respective\ninterests in the Property, for the costs and expenses related to\nthe administration of Father’s estate and the upkeep of the Property.",
        "The issues": "44     Based\non the parties’ respective pleadings and submissions, it was common\nground that the Plaintiffs’ entitlement to their reliefs, in particular the\nclaims for declarations that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial\nowner of the Property and that Dawood has no legal or beneficial\ninterest in the Property, were predicated entirely on my finding\nin relation to the issue of whether Dawood had, on the Plaintiff’s\ncase, breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. Although the question\nof ownership and title to the Property was governed by the provisions\nof the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed), both sides were content\nto rest the dispute on the issue of whether Dawood had breached\nthe Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. Both sides accordingly made no submissions\non whether the provisions in the Land Titles Act had any bearing\non the declarations sought. I proceeded on that same footing. 45     Thus,\nthe issues before me were: (a)     whether\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act; (b)     if\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim was not time-barred, which of the two agreements\n– the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement or Dawood’s 2004 Agreement – was\nconcluded and binding; (c)     if\nthe Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was concluded and binding, whether\nDawood, in transferring the Property to Mother and his joint names,\nhad breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement; and (d)     finally,\nwhether the lodgement of the Caveat was wrongful, vexatious or otherwise\nwithout reasonable cause and if so, what were the consequences.",
        "My decision": "",
        "Whether the Plaintiffs’ claim\nwas time-barred": "The applicable provision in\nthe Limitation Act 46     Throughout\ntheir pleadings, the Plaintiffs’ referred to the Plaintiffs’ 2004\nAgreement by a somewhat confusing description – “representation and/or\nunderstanding and/or agreement”. 47     This\ndescription was all important because Dawood’s defence was that\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim was time-barred by s 6 of the Limitation Act\nbut s 6 only applies if the Plaintiffs’ claim can be properly characterised\nas one founded in contract or tort (there are other categories but\nthey clearly do not apply). 48     In\nmy view, the cause of action disclosed by the pleadings was an action\nfor breach of contract. The Plaintiffs’ principal claim was that\nthere had been a Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement which Dawood breached\nby transferring the Property to Mother and himself under a joint\ntenancy. This was a plain vanilla contract claim. Although the Statement\nof Claim had used words such as “representation” or “understanding”,\nthese were used synonymously with the word “agreement” in the contractual\nsense and not as self-standing elements of a different cause of\naction. In any event, I did not think that the pleadings disclosed\nany other cause of action outside of contract or tort. For that\nreason, s 6 was applicable. 49     I\ndid not agree with Mr Sahagar’s submission that s 6 of the Limitation\nAct did not apply because the Plaintiffs’ claim was an action to recover\nland (which under s 9 has a 12-year limitation period) or, alternatively,\na claim to any share of Father’s estate (which under s 23 has no\nlimitation period). 50     First,\ns 9 of the Limitation Act applies to cases involving a cause of action\nfor the recovery of land that is premised on an existing proprietary right.\nFor example, Steven Chong J in the High Court case ofTeh Siew Hua v Tan Kim Chiong[2010] 4\nSLR 123 noted at [40] that s 9 is concerned with an action by a\nperson with legal title to the land against an adverse possessor.\nIn another High Court case,Tay Tuan Kiatand another v Pritnam Singh Brar[1985-1986]\nSLR(R) 763, L P Thean J considered a claim for an order to demolish\nan existing retaining wall and to build a new wall in its place\nbut in a different location, as falling within s 9 because it gave\nthe plaintiff possession of a portion of property that had been encroached\nupon. 51     A\nbreach of an agreement over the administration and division of an estate\nis not a cause of action for the recovery of land premised on an existing\nproprietary right. 52     Accordingly,\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim was not governed by s 9 of the Limitation\nAct to the exclusion of s 6. 53     As\nfor Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission that the Plaintiffs’ claim was\na claim for a share or interest in Father’s estate, I did not agree\nwith this submission either because the pleadings plainly did not\ndisclose such a cause of action. Although the Property concerned\nwas at one point part of Father’s estate, there was no averment\nto the effect that the Plaintiffs were entitled to a general or\nspecific share of Father’s estate either by way of a will or under\nrelevant intestacy laws. Mr Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim, counsel for Dawood\n(“Mr Zhulkarnain”), rightly pointed out that there could not be\na claim to Father’s estate because, on the Plaintiffs’ own case,\nthey already each had an interest in Father’s estate; it was those\nvery interests which they had given up to Mother (on the Plaintiffs’\ncase) under the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. The\nremedies sought by the Plaintiffs (see [39] above) were also inconsistent\nwith a claim to a share of Father’s estate. 54     Accordingly,\nthe Plaintiffs’ claim was not governed by s 23 of the Limitation\nAct to the exclusion of s 6. Further reasons against time-bar 55     Mr\nSahagar gave two further reasons why the claim was not time-barred,\nnotwithstanding the operation of s 6 of the Limitation Act. First, equity\nwill not allow a statute to be used to further a fraud. Secondly,\nthe commencement of the limitation period was postponed by s 29\nof the Limitation Act because there was fraud involved which could\nnot have been discovered with reasonable diligence. I will discuss\nthese two reasons in turn. (1)   Equity will not allow\na statute to be used to further a fraud 56     Mr\nSahagar had misunderstood the application of the maxim which he\nhad taken fromHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporevol\n9(2) (LexisNexis, 2003) (“Halsbury’s”)\nat para 110.014. 57     The\npurpose of the rule that equity will not permit a statute to be\nused as an engine of fraud, as stated in the same paragraph of the\nsame volume ofHalsbury’s, is to\nprovide a means of escape for a deserving plaintiff who has failed\nto comply with prescribed formalities, a failure which would ordinarily\nrender the transaction unenforceable at law. Prescribed formalities\nrefer to rules requiring, for example, a declaration of trust over land\nto be evidenced by a memorandum signed by the person able to declare\nit; an assignment of an equitable interest to be effected in writing\nby the person disposing of it; or a contract for the sale of land\nto be evidenced by writing. 58     Ostensibly,\nthe maxim had no application to the present case, and certainly\nnot in the way that Mr Sahagar submitted it should apply, that is, to\npreclude the application of s 6 of the Limitation Act. 59     In\nsummary, save for s 29 of the Limitation Act, all the other exceptions\nraised by Mr Sahagar to postpone the limitation period under s 6 of\ndid not apply. (2)   Postponement of the\ncommencement of the limitation period by s 29 of the Limitation\nAct 60     The\nargument here was that because of Dawood’s surreptitious transfer\nof the Property, his breach of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement remained\nconcealed until 2011 when Aysha learnt of the ownership of the Property\nfrom Mr Ibrahim. Accordingly, pursuant to s 29(1)(b)\nof the Limitation Act, which postpones the limitation period in\ncases where the right of action is concealed by the fraud of the\ndefendant, the six-year limitation period only started running from\nthe time the Plaintiffs discovered the fraud, that is, 2011. On\nthis basis, the Plaintiffs’ commencement of proceedings in 2013\nwas therefore well within the limitation period. 61     It\nis a prerequisite of s 29(1)(b)\nof the Limitation Act that the “right of action is concealed by\nthe fraud of [the defendant]”. In other words, at the minimum, the\nPlaintiffs had to show that Dawood had “knowingly or recklessly\ncommitted a wrongdoing in secret without telling [the Plaintiffs]” (seeBank of America National Trust and Savings Association\nv Herman Iskandar[1998] 1 SLR(R) 848 (“Bank\nof America”) at [73]–[75] which was cited with approval\nby the Court of Appeal inChua Teck Chew Robert\nv Goh Eng Wah[2009] 4 SLR(R) 716 (“Goh\nEng Wah”) at [27]). 62     To\naddress this issue, it was necessary to descend into the facts.\nUnlike most of the other pleas of limitation periods which are typically\ndisposed of as a preliminary issue by way of a summary judgment\napplication (see Andrew McGee,Limitation Periods(Sweet\n& Maxwell, 2005) (“McGee”) at para\n21.007), the specific issue of the postponement of the limitation\nperiod because of fraud and concealment is, in some cases, unsuitable\nfor preliminary determination. This is because the question of fraud\nand concealment, which further brings into question the plaintiff’s\ndiligence in discovering the fraud or concealment, often turns on\nthe proving of a myriad of facts which are hotly contested: see\nforeg,Bank\nAmericaandGoh Eng Wah. 63     Less\napparent are situations where the issue of postponement of the limitation\nperiod may be moot as a result the court’s findings and holdings in\nrelation to the cause of action which is said to be infected by\nthe same fraudulent conduct that concealed the cause of action from\nthe plaintiff. The present case is one such example. Here, the very\nbasis of the postponement of the limitation period, Dawood’s alleged\nfraudulent conduct in relation to the transfer of the Property,\nwas founded on the same alleged factual matrix supporting the Plaintiffs’\nclaim for breach of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 64     My\nfindings on the evidence in relation to that factual matrix were therefore\ndeterminative of both the main cause of action, as well as the limitation\nperiod issue. Notwithstanding, it is important to note that in such\ncases, both the merits and the limitation period issues have been determined.\nThis distinction is important because generally, the effect of a holding\nthat an action is time-barred by a limitation period is the action may\nnot be brought inthatcourt, even\nthough the right to bring the cause of action is not extinguished\n(seeMcGeeat para 1.008), whereas\nthe holding that the cause of action is dismissed on the merits\nrenders that cause of action determined and hence subject to the\nusualres judicataprinciples. 65     Although\nMr Sahagar’s submissions refer specifically to s 29(1)(b) of the Limitation Act. I noted that\nthe factual matrix alleged by the Plaintiffs may also fall within\ns 29(1)(a) of the Limitation Act,\nwhich similarly postpones the limitation period where the cause\nof action is based on fraud of the defendant. For the avoidance\nof doubt, the views that I have expressed above (at [61] to [64])\napply to an argument based on s 29(1)(a) as\nwell. 66     For\nthe above reasons, I shall reserve articulation of my decision on the\npostponement of the limitation period on account of s 29(1) of the Limitation\nAct until after I have described the factual controversies and given\nmy findings in relation to those controversies (see [163] to [168] below).\nI turn to these now.",
        "Which of the two agreements\nwas concluded and binding": "67     There\nwere three possibilities: (a) the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was concluded\nand binding; (b) Dawood’s 2004 Agreement was concluded and binding;\nor (c) there was no agreement concluded on the terms of either agreement.\nThese were all mutually incompatible options. Largely due to the\npaucity of consistent and credible evidence, it was difficult to\ndetermine which of the three options reflected the true situation\nin 2004. 68     In\nthe end, the decision on the existence and validity of the various agreements\ncame down to a rather technical (and some might say, unpalatable\nprinciple) – he who alleges bears the burden of proof. I was not convinced\nthat either side had proven that their version of the agreement was\nthe true agreement. In my view, it was more likely that agreement\non the ownership of the Property was never properly discussed and\nconcluded. All that can be said – and all that matters as far as\nthe present proceedings were concerned – was that the parties executed\ncertain documents which in their nature had the effect of transferring\nof the Property to Dawood and Mother as joint tenants. 69     I\nshall explain the reasons for my conclusion, beginning with the problems\nwith the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. The Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement (1)   Lack of particulars\nof the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement 70     As\nalluded to above, I found several aspects of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement\ntroubling. The first concerned the details of the formation of this\nagreement. 71     The\ncornerstone of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was a meeting in which\nthe Plaintiffs and Dawood consented to the arrangement for the Property\nto be conveyed into Mother’s sole name. Yet, despite the importance\nof this meeting, none of the Plaintiffs gave or could give particulars\nof the meeting, including for instance, when the meeting took place. 72     All\nfour affidavits of evidence-in-chief (“AEICs” or “AEIC”) by the Plaintiffs\nonly provided vague references to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement being\nformed four years after Father’s death. It is apposite to mention,\nhere, that the combined length of all four of the Plaintiffs’ AEICs\n(excluding exhibits) was a measly 39 pages. 73     Nevertheless,\nbecause the reason given by the Plaintiffs for the Plaintiffs’ 2004\nAgreement was their surprise at how small Mother’s share of the\nProperty was under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate (which was issued on\n24 February 2004), it can be inferred that this meeting which led\nto the conclusion of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement took place only\non or after 24 February 2004. 74     The\nfact that a meeting took place was not even mentioned in the Plaintiffs’\naffidavits. It only came to light during Aysha’s cross-examination, though\nshe could not recall the date of the meeting. She said that the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement “took place” during a meeting one afternoon at the\nProperty. By “took place” I understood her to mean “was formed”. (2)   Parties present at\nthis meeting 75     When\nasked who amongst the parties were present, she said “Dawood, myself,\nmy mum”. She could not remember whether Jahir was there; she was\ncertain, though, that Noorjahan was not. In his own testimony, Jahir\nsaid that he was not present at this meeting. Jahir claimed that\nhe had not seen Dawood throughout the relevant time. In fact, Jahir’s evidence\nwas that he did not have sight of the 2nd Inheritance Certificate\nat the time that he allegedly agreed to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 76     Therein\nlay the problem. For the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement to have been\nconcluded, Jahir, Dawood, Aysha and Noorjahan must have offered\nto waive their interests in favour of Mother and simultaneously\naccepted the offer by the others to do the same. Aysha said she\ncalled Noorjahan during the meeting to inform Noorjahan of the contents\nof the 2nd Inheritance Certificate, and that according to the lawyer\nthat Dawood consulted, if the children wanted Mother to be the sole\nowner, each child had to give up his or her respective interest\nto Mother. 77     I\nwas not sure whether such a conversation took place but there were other\nproblems even if I could accept that the conversation did take place. The\nmost obvious problem was the continued absence of Jahir. It was\nnever established when or how Jahir came to be part of this Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement. He was not present at the alleged meeting, and neither\nwas he informed through a call in the same way that Noorjahan apparently\nwas. 78     Jahir\nagreed to the suggestion put to him by Mr Zhulkarnain that he did\nnot “know whether Dawood agreed to the [Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement]”.\nAt minimum, there was no offer and acceptance as between Jahir and\nDawood. It is worth pausing here to note that if there was no agreement\nbetween Jahir, who is one of the Plaintiffs, and Dawood, it was difficult\nto find in favour of the Plaintiffs’ submission that there was a Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement. 79     Jahir\nseemed to me to be ignorant of the salient features of his own case,\nin particular, details of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. He even candidly\nadmitted that much of what he had allegedly “agreed” to, or knew about\n(in relation to the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement) came from Aysha\nand Noorjahan. That admission could be read in a number of ways.\nSuffice to say, I did not think Jahir had any material or significant\npart to play in this Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 80     More\nthan that, Jahir even made statements that contradicted what the\nother Plaintiffs were saying. For example, in direct opposition\nto Aysha’s evidence (see [74] above), he said that the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement was reached “following several conversations between\nthe siblings and our mother”. Just on the basis of Jahir’s involvement\n(or the lack thereof) and his evidence on what transpired alone,\nI thought that the Plaintiffs’ case for the existence of the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement was rather weak. (3)   Problems with Aysha’s\ntestimony 81     There\nwas a more serious issue. Aysha’s testimony (at [76] above) was internally\nincoherent. According to her, Dawood produced the 2nd Inheritance\nCertificate for the first time in the same meeting where the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement was formed. She testified that it wasonlythenthat\nthe Plaintiffs – or at least Mother and her – found out about the respective\ninterests each person was entitled to under Syariah law. If this meeting\nwas the first time that Mother and her knew about the shares that each\nfamily member was entitled to, and hence there could not have been any\nunderstanding prior to this meeting that the children were going\nto give their shares to Mother, why would Dawood have sought legal\nadvice as to how Mother could inherit the entire Property? This\npart of Aysha’s testimony simply did not make sense. 82     Given\nthat the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was only formed at this meeting\nat the earliest, Dawood had no reason to take pre-emptive steps\nto find out how the children could transfer their interests to Mother\nto enable her to be the sole owner of the Property during her lifetime,\nas Aysha claimed. Mother had not known of her relatively small share\nbefore she was shown the 2nd Inheritance Certificate at this meeting.\nJahir, Aysha and Noorjahan, too, did not know how much their respective\nshares would be. Dawood therefore could not have known before this\nmeeting that the Plaintiffs wanted to transfer their shares to Mother\nbecause her share was the smallest compared to theirs. Accordingly,\nDawood did not have any reason to and would not have asked Mr Singh\nhow Mother can be the sole owner of the Property notwithstanding\nthe 2nd Inheritance Certificate. (4)   Problems with Mother’s\ntestimony 83     There\nwas also Mother’s testimony which went against the Plaintiffs’ 2004\nAgreement. Although some leeway ought to be given to Mother’s ability\nto recall events given her advanced age, I could not ignore or discount\nher positive assertion during cross-examination that she had told Dawood\nto transfer the house to her name after Father passed away, and that\nDawood had agreed to her request. 84     If\nthis were true, then it was Mother’s idea that the Property be transferred\nto her sole name. This was not in any of the Plaintiffs’ AEICs, nor\nwas this alluded to in the Statement of Claim. Mother made no mention of\nthis in her own AEIC. To the contrary, her evidence there was significantly\nmore passive – “[f]rom what I recall, the children agreed to defer\nthe division of the house [until] after I pass[ed] away”. This can\nalso be interpreted uncharitably as a point of inconsistency between\nher affidavit and oral evidence regarding the source of the instruction\nfor the transfer of the Property. 85     There\nwere a few other different motives given in the AEICs of the Plaintiff\nSiblings, chief of which was that the children had out of filial\npiety agreed to give up their interests to Mother because she had\nreceived the smallest share under the 2nd Inheritance Certificate.\nThis was also the reason given by Noorjahan in her oral testimony.\nAysha’s affidavit evidence suggested yet another reason for the\ntransfer – transferring ownership of the house into everyone’s respective\nshares required much more paperwork and would have incurred unnecessary\nstamp fees and legal costs. (5)   Problems with Noorjahan’s\ntestimony 86     Apart\nfrom the discrepancy relating to the motives for the transfer of the\nProperty between the testimony of Noorjahan and that of Mother (compare\n[83], [84] and [85] above), Noorjahan’s testimony departed from the\nothers in at least one other material aspect. When asked how she\nknew that all the siblings had agreed to the terms of the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement, she said that that was what Aysha had communicated\nto her in the phone call that was made in that meeting with Dawood\nwhere everyone first found out about the shares under the 2nd Inheritance\nCertificate (see [76] above). Noorjahan specifically said that she\nagreed to give up her share to Mother as well because Aysha had\ntold her that “[the] brothers were okay with it”. 87     This\nwas incorrect. Jahir was not at the meeting. This was in Jahir’s testimony\nand the testimony of Aysha, and there was no suggestion by Aysha\nthat she had called Jahir to ask him for his opinion. In fact, Aysha’s own\nevidence was that on the day that Dawood showed Mother and her the 2nd\nInheritance Certificate, she could not recall whether Jahir had\nagreed. It was therefore not likely that Aysha would have said that\nthe brothers, that is, Jahir and Dawood, had approved of the Plaintiffs’\n2004 Agreement. (6)   The Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest 88     Perhaps\nmost critical of all, the Plaintiffs had to explain away the Deed\nof Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which flatly contradicts\nthe Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement. 89     At\nthis juncture, it has to be emphasised that the Plaintiffs acknowledged\nthat they had signed this deed. At no point did the Plaintiffs dispute\nthe authenticity of their signatures on any of the relevant documents\nthat they had signed. 90     The\nPlaintiffs’ sole dispute in relation to the documents was the manner\nof execution. 91     On\nthat premise, the Plaintiffs had to explain why the Plaintiff Siblings\nhad signed the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which clearly\nstated that they were waiving their interest in favour of Mother\nand Dawood. Another discrepancy that required explanation was why\nthe Plaintiffs did not consider it odd that Dawood did not sign\nthe same document if it were clearly their agreement that the four\nchildren were to waive their interests in favour of Mother. 92     The\nPlaintiffs’ explanation for both discrepancies was essentially the same,\nwhich is that Dawood had deceived them into signing the Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest. In the main, the Plaintiffs’ claimed: (a)     they\nhad signed various documents at different times and at different\nplaces – some in the Solicitors’ office, but others at home; (b)     they\nwere mostly only given – either by Dawood or the Solicitors – the\nsignature pages of each document to sign; (c)     there\nwas never any explanation by anyone, including the Solicitors, as\nto the nature and contents of the documents; and (d)     they\nhad signed whatever that was presented to them unquestioningly because\nthey had assumed that Dawood was carrying out the Plaintiffs’ 2004\nAgreement. 93     All\nof the above were of course denied by Dawood, as well as the Solicitors.\nThe Solicitors asserted that the Plaintiffs had signed the relevant documents\nin the Solicitors’ office, and only after the contents and implications\nof the documents had been explained by Mr Singh to the Plaintiffs.\nDawood corroborated this assertion with further evidence that he had\naccompanied the Plaintiffs at various times to the Solicitors’ office\nto sign the documents. 94     Specifically,\nin the case of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest which\nwas signed on 27 February 2004, the evidence of the Solicitors was\nthat the Plaintiff Siblings had attended at their office, were informed\nby Mr Singh in English of the nature and implication of this deed, and\nthat they had signed this deed only after Mr Singh’s explanation. 95     Another\ndeed was also signed on 27 February 2004. This was the Deed of Renunciation\nof Persons with Equal Rights. Under this deed, the four Plaintiffs\nagreed to renounce their right to letters of administration of Father’s\nestate, which effectively meant that Dawood was solely responsible for\nthe administration of Father’s estate. 96     Ms\nKaur was very clear in her evidence that Mr Singh and she had explained\nto the Plaintiffs that the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest\nand the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights were two\ndifferent documents. She said there was “no hint of disharmony or dissent\nof any sort between the family members” and that the Plaintiffs simply\nagreed and nodded. 97     Limiting\nthe issue to the signing of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest (as this was the most crucial document), the diametrically\nopposed evidence from both sides could in my view be resolved by\nthe determination of just one question: whose testimony – that of\nthe Plaintiffs on one side or that of Dawood and the Solicitors\non the other – relating to the Plaintiffs’ visit to the Solicitors’\noffice on 27 February 2004 was more credible? 98     This\nwas the lynchpin of both sides’ evidence because either the Plaintiffs\nwere right and that not all of them were present on 27 February 2004\n(in which case Dawood and the Solicitors were all lying and everything\nthereon could not be believed), or conversely, the Plaintiffs were all\npresent on 27 February 2004 (which meant that the Plaintiffs were\nall lying about signing single signature pages at home, with the\ncorollary that Dawood and the Solicitors were telling the truth). 99     Although\nI am cognisant of the firm rule of evidence that the evidence of\na witness ought not to be rejected completely simply because the\nwitness was unreliable or untrue in some parts, recently emphasised\nby the Court of Appeal inAlwieHandoyo v Tjong Very Sumito and another and another appeal[2013]\n4 SLR 308 at [59]–[61], both sides had organised their case and\nmustered their evidence on an all-or-nothing basis – the entire\ncase theory put forward by either side on the circumstances surrounding\nthe signing of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest had\nto be accepted or rejected in full. There was no room for any middle\nground. 100    In\nmy judgment, for the following reasons, I found Dawood, Mr Singh\nand Ms Kaur’s combined testimony that the Plaintiffs were all present\nin the Solicitors’ office on 27 February 2004 to be more credible. (A)   Inconsistencies in\nthe Plaintiffs’ version of events 101    Mother’s\nevidence was that she had only been to the Solicitors’ office once,\nand that she was accompanied by Aysha and Dawood on that single visit.\nShe could not recall the date but she could recall very clearly\nthat she arrived at the Solicitors’ office in the afternoon, specifically,\nat 2pm. 102    Dawood’s\nevidence was that the appointment was at 3pm. Mother and Aysha both\nsaid that it was Dawood who brought them to the Solicitors’ office\non 27 February 2004. 103    Mother\ncould remember certain things but not others. For example, she recalled\nthe following: she had signed only one document that day; she was\nthe first to sign that document; the signing took place in a room\nin the office; and she left the room after signing. When asked if\nMr Singh was in the room, her response was “there were a few girls[,]\nsimilar to what it is here in the room”. I understood her to mean\nthat the number of people present in the Solicitors’ office was\nsimilar to what she was seeing in court at that time. 104    Pausing\nhere, at least two of her above recollections were curious. The first\nwas the number of documents that she remembered signing. In her AEIC,\nher evidence was that she had “signedsomedocuments”\nduring the sole visit she made to the Solicitors’ office. Apart\nfrom that, it was also strange that Mother remembered that there\nwere “a few girls” in the room where she signed the document(s).\nAlthough Aysha did not say whether there were others in that room\nwhere the signing took place, her testimony was that she had stood\noutside the room when Mother was signing as the “room was small”.\nIf Aysha was outside, and Noorjahan was not present, who were these\ngirls that Mother was referring to? Even accounting for Ms Kaur’s\npresence, Mother’s recollection that there were “a few girls” in\nthe room did not accord with the other parts of hers and/or Aysha’s testimonies. 105    I\ncould not rule out the possibility that Mother was describing the main\noffice where some other secretaries were seated and not the room where\nthe signing took place but that would only lend weight to the suggestion\nthat Mother’s recollection was, at best, hazy. 106    Moreover,\ndespite being able to remember certain details, Mother was unsure\nof a number of other details, including key details such as whether Aysha\nhad signed the document at all, where Aysha was when she (Mother) signed\nand after she (Mother) had signed, whether Mr Singh was present\nin the room; and whether it was the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest\nor the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights that she had\nsigned. 107    In\nthe light of the above, I found Mother’s evidence to be, on the whole,\nunhelpful and unreliable. 108    There\nwas no basis for me to accept only evidence that she could recall and\nto dismiss the fact that she was unable to recall other important\ndetails as inconsequential. If the details that she had forgotten\nwere incidental to the execution of the documents, I might have\nconsidered her memory lapses unimportant. However, the details that\nshe could not remember were vital. Her inability to recall vital\ndetails immediately called into question her reliability as a witness\nof fact. 109    I\nwas mindful of my role which was to separate the wheat from the chaff\nbut there are situations when the wheat and chaff are so inextricably intertwined\nthat it would be unwise and unsafe to attempt to distil fact from fiction.\nMother’s evidence was one such instance. 110    I\nturn now to Aysha’s evidence since she claimed that she was the\nonly other of the Plaintiffs to have been present in the Solicitors’\noffice on 27 February 2004. Aysha confirmed that Mr Singh was in\nthe room when she and Mother signed the document(s). However, she\nand Mother were not in the room at the same time when the other\nwas signing. Aysha only signed after Mother had signed and left\nthe room. This was at least consistent with Mother’s testimony the\nday before. Aysha also confirmed – both in her AEIC and during cross-examination\n– that she had signed on more than one sheet of paper; in other\nwords, she signed on at least two (if not more sheets) of paper. 111    As\nonly two documents – the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interests\nand the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights – were signed\nand dated 27 February 2004, Aysha must have signed those two documents\nwhen she attended the Solicitors’ office even if she could not recall\nor claimed not to know what she had signed. 112    Hence,\nthe only remaining question that was relevant was whether Aysha’s\nevidence that she was only given single pages to sign without any accompanying\nexplanation from either Mr Singh or Ms Kaur was credible. Even leaving\naside evidence to the contrary from Mr Singh, Ms Kaur and Dawood,\nI did not think that it was likely that Aysha had only been given the\nsignature page of the relevant documents to sign, nor was it likely\nthat she had signed single pages without inquiring both as to the\nearlier pages of the documents as well as the nature and implications\nof what she was signing. I shall explain. 113    First,\nit did not make sense for Mr Singh (he had primary carriage over\nthe matter) to only show the signature page to Mother and Aysha\n– why would he do that? Just from a common sense perspective, it\nseemed more troublesome to separate a two-page document only to\nrecombine the pages after the signature page had been signed by\nthe relevant signatories. Mr Singh had no reason to inconvenience\nhimself in this manner. Factor in Mr Singh’s professional standing\nas a senior lawyer with more than 30 years in practice and as a\nCommissioner of Oaths, it would have been extremely risky for him\nto have only presented the signature pages to Mother and Aysha without\nthe accompanying first page, which sets out the gist of the document\nthat was being signed. In the absence of any ulterior motive – there\nwas no suggestion of a conspiracy between Dawood and the Solicitors to\ncheat the Plaintiffs – I found that scenario most improbable. 114    Second,\nthe signature page of both deeds begged questions to be asked. The\nsignature page of the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal\nRights began with: right and title to Letters of Administration\nof the Estate of the said deceased.  Signed by the said)[Mother][Jahir][Aysha][Noorjahan]))))    … 115    On\ntheir own, the words at the beginning of the signature page made no\nsense whatsoever. The normal, reasonable reaction would be to either ask\nto see the previous page to verify that the words were part of a\nsentence in the previous page, or to have asked for an explanation\nfrom the person who prepared the document what that sentence meant. 116    On\nAysha’s evidence, she did neither of those. On her evidence, Mother\ntoo did neither of those. Perhaps one person might have been lax, but\ntwo people failing to do what was the most logical and natural thing\nto do, beggared belief. 117    Likewise,\nthe first words on the signature page of the Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest were complete nonsense on their own: [Mother] and the said Dawood. IN WITNESS WHEREOF we have hereunto set\nour hands and seals the 27thday of February\n2004.  Signed sealed and delivered by)[Jahir][Aysha][Noorjahan])))    … 118    In\nfact, “[Mother] and the said Dawood” was clearly even more meaningless\nthan “right and title to Letters of Administration of the Estate of\nthe said deceased” (see [114] above). No person who had enough mental faculties\nto know that she was in a lawyer’s office signing legal documents would\nhave signed either, much less both, pages without any attempt to\nfind out more about the documents, unless of course the documents\nhad already been explained by someone. 119    Furthermore,\nthe signatures required in the Deed of Beneficial Interest were\npalpably different from the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with\nEqual Rights. The absence of Mother’s signature or the need for\nit was glaringly obvious. Aysha must have known this. She knew that\nMother was the first to sign the Deed of Renunciation of Persons\nwith Equal Rights which meant that she must have noticed Mother’s\nsignature there. She ought therefore to have noticed the absence\nof Mother’s signature in the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest, and that would have been of some interest to her, at the\nvery least: why did Mother not sign this other document? 120    Thirdly,\neven if Aysha had not paid attention to the incomprehensible words\nat the beginning, she must have wondered what this other document, one\nthat did not require Mother’s signature, was about. This would have prompted\nher to at least ask for the previous page, or perhaps more directly, to\nask Mr Singh or Dawood for clarification. Again, on her own case,\nshe did neither. She simply signed. 121    It\nis apposite to address a point made persistently by Mr Sahagar in his\nsubmissions. He harped on the fact that Father’s name had been misspelt\nin a number of the documents executed in the course of the administration\nof the estate. In relation to the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest, the mistake was a missing “Mohamed” in the first page of\nthe document. The Father’s name was wrongly written as “Kamaldi\nBin Aboobabkar @ Mohamed Aboobakar Kamaldin” instead of “Kamaldi\nBin Mohamed Aboobakar @ Mohamed Aboobakar Kamaldin”. Mr Sahagar submitted\nthat if the Plaintiffs did have sight of the first page of this\ndeed where the error was initially made, they would certainly have\nspotted the error. Hence, the fact that the error was not spotted\nsupported the assertion that the Plaintiffs were not given the first\npage of the deed before being asked to sign. 122    Mr\nSahagar’s argument was, to me, an exercise in creating a mountain out\nof a molehill. I was not as sure as he was that the Plaintiffs would\nhave spotted the error. On the Plaintiffs’ own case, for the reasons\nthat I have mentioned at [114] to [120] above, Mother and Aysha\nwere not exactly the most observant or inquisitive people. If they\ncould miss the numerous red flags that were screaming to be discovered\n(on their own testimony they were only shown the signature pages),\nI very much doubt that they would have spotted the error in the\nspelling of Father’s name. Father’s name is neither simple nor short. 123    Even\non my finding that the Plaintiffs were present in the Solicitors’ office,\nI was not convinced that just because there was an error, it must\nbe inferred that the Plaintiffs did not see the first page. They\ncould have seen it but thought nothing of it because it was evidently\nclear that notwithstanding the misspelt name, the person referred\nto was Father and no one else. After all, Father’s NRIC number was\nwritten on the same page, and more importantly, the only interests\nthat they could possibly renounce was their interest in Father’s\nestate. (B)   The documentary evidence 124    The\nDeed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest was accompanied at the\nend by a declaration by Mr Singh that the signatories had voluntarily signed\nthe documents in his presence. 125    Similarly,\nthe Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Right ended with\nMr Singh acknowledging with his signature that the signatories had\nsigned the document before him. 126    Therefore,\non the face of the two documents, the relevant Plaintiffs had signed\nthem in the presence of Mr Singh. The only theory that accommodates\nthis fact is Dawood’s theory – that all the Plaintiffs had attended\nat the Solicitors’ office. On the Plaintiffs’ case, Mr Singh’s declaration\nand acknowledgement in the two deeds were misleading because Mr\nSingh was not present at all times when the documents were signed. 127    All\nthe Plaintiffs had by way of supporting evidence was their oral testimony\nthat Jahir and Noorjahan were not present when Mother and Aysha\nsigned the documents, and that Jahir and Noorjahan had signed the documents\nin the Property at other times when Mr Singh was not around. At\nthe same time, the Plaintiffs could not give direct and clear evidence\nof the circumstances surrounding Jahir and Noorjahan’s signing of\nthe documents. 128    For\nexample, Jahir said he could not recall whether the others had signed\nthe Deed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights before he signed\nit, nor could he recall whether Mr Singh had already pre-acknowledged\nthat the signatories had signed the document in his presence. 129    Noorjahan\nwas slightly better. She recalled being the last to sign both the\nDeed of Renunciation of Persons with Equal Rights and the Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest. She also recalled not seeing Mr Singh’s signature\nacknowledging that the signatories had signed in his presence in both\ndocuments. 130    But\nher credibility took a big hit, in my judgment, in her response\nto Mr Zhulkarnain’s query whether Noorjahan had asked Mother for\nthe first page of both documents. Noorjahan replied: First of all, we never knew there was pages\nattached to this signature page, so how are we to know what page\n– how many pages is – we – we are supposed to have for this sign\ndocument and how many pages we are supposed to have for this signatory\npage? 131    It\nwas almost as if Noorjahan had been rehearsing her lyrics for a song.\nThe only snag, though, was that she had sung at a wrong time. It\nwas incredible, in my view, that she could genuinely have thought\nthat the signature page was the only page of the two documents that\nshe had appended her signature to. I have already made the same\nobservation in relation to Mother and Aysha above, but this was\neven more egregious. Here we have a sibling who had all the time\nduring her visiting of Mother to look through the documents before\nsigning. Yet, her evidence was that it did not occur to her that\nthe two signature pages (see [114] and [117] above) were part of\na document which had more than one page. That view was simply not\ncredible. 132    The\nshift in Noorjahan’s testimony which occurred just moments later\nwas also telling. Now, instead of saying that she could not have\nknown if the signature page was preceded by other pages, Noorjahan\nessentially said that she had signed because all her family members\nhad signed. To my mind, Noorjahan recognised that she had misspoken.\nAgain, the exchange merits full reproduction: Q:Okay.\nBut would you agree that there should be something in front of this\n[signature] page? … A:Because\nat that point, it didn’t matter to me who has signed the document.\nIt was all my family members who have sign the documents. Q:Yes. A:Whether my mum have sign, or Dawood\nhas sign, I wouldn’t know who – only the lawyers would know what\nare the – who are the people who should be signing this document.\nSo we went ahead with that. 133    Accordingly,\nI was not persuaded that the oral testimony of the Plaintiffs did\nenough to contradict the documentary evidence that Mr Singh was\npresent when the Plaintiffs signed the Deed of Renunciation of Persons with\nEqual Rights and the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. (C)   The Solicitors’ evidence 134    I\nturn then to the evidence by the Solicitors. Both were consistent\nin their evidence that the Plaintiffs were all present at the Solicitors’\noffice on 27 February 2004, were informed by Mr Singh in English\nof the nature and implications of the various documents that the\nPlaintiffs were about to sign, and the Plaintiffs signed these documents\nvoluntarily and without demur. I did not have any good reason to\ndisbelieve their evidence, especially in the light of the significant\nissues that I had with the coherence and reliability of the Plaintiffs’\nevidence. 135    The\nSolicitors’ evidence appealed more to me partly because of their ability\nto recall specific details. For instance, Mr Singh recalled that\nMother understood English which was why he did not have to explain\nthe documents in Tamil. Mother denied that she understood English\nbut based on my own observations after her cross-examination, notwithstanding\nthat a translator was present, I was convinced that she could understand\nbasic English. From Mr Singh’s brief re-enactment of the explanation\nof the documents, I was satisfied that his explanation was simple\nenough even for lay people with a very basic command of the English\nlanguage to understand. Mr Singh also recalled that the atmosphere\nin the office was “very friendly and cordial”. 136    But\nit was the Solicitors’ recollection of the personalities of the\nvarious Plaintiffs that struck me most. Mr Singh said that Aysha,\nNoorjahan and Dawood were the “chattier ones” whereas Jahir was\nrather “quiet” and “simple”. What was more impressive was Mr Singh’s\nspecific recollection that Noorjahan and Ms Kaur were talking about\nPunjabi dresses, and also, that Aysha and Mother had not donned\nthe Muslim attire. 137    When\nasked by Mr Sahagar how he could remember the Plaintiffs’ traits\nafter all these years, Mr Singh replied that he just did, but also\nbecause he found the family interesting, in that Dawood looked different\nfrom Jahir. Dawood was suave, authoritative and a tad showy while\nJahir was simple and quiet even though Jahir was the eldest son.\nThat stuck in his mind. 138    Ms\nKaur too gave evidence that Aysha and Noorjahan were chatty and\nthat Jahir was “a bit quiet”. Ms Kaur also said that when the Plaintiffs first\narrived, she spoke to Mother, Aysha and Noorjahan. They exchanged the\nusual pleasantries and Ms Kaur offered her condolences, all in English. At\none point, Ms Kaur said that “the ladies” – that is, herself and\nMother, Aysha and Noorjahan – chatted about “a lot of other things”\nthat she could not reveal because of legal privilege. In contrast,\nJahir was extremely quiet. That was how she remembered the family. 139    I\nhad no reason to doubt the Solicitors’ evidence which seemed wholly credible.\nMr Sahagar missed the point in his submissions when he stressed that\nloquaciousness and talking about Punjabi dresses were not so distinctive\nthat the Solicitors had any special reason to remember this set\nof clients. 140    Distinctiveness\nmay lend special reason to remember an event or persons, but the\nabsence of it cannot be a positive reason for inferring that a recollection\nwas not possible. My assessment was that the Solicitors could remember\npockets of what happened because there were things about the Plaintiffs,\nboth individually and collectively, that caught their attention. Moreover,\nthe Solicitors continued to interact with some of the Plaintiffs thereafter\nin subsequent meetings to sign further documents. The Plaintiffs were\ntherefore not just clients who came only once and left in a matter\nof minutes. (D)   The allegation of\nmultiple stapling 141    I\nhave to deal with a technical evidential point that Mr Sahagar raised. He\nstressed that the top left corner of the original Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest was in a relatively damaged state because\nit had been stapled, unstapled then re-stapled a number of times.\nMr Singh confirmed during cross-examination that was the case from\nthe looks of the original copy. 142    The\ninference that Mr Sahagar was inviting me to draw was that the damaged\ncorner of the pages supported his submission that the Plaintiffs only\nsaw the signature page; the damage had occurred because the pages had\nbeen separated then recombined a number of times. 143    I\ndeclined to draw that inference for two reasons. The first is that\nMr Singh’s explanation for the damaged state of the pages was plausible.\nHe said that because the amendment to Father’s name was typed into\nthe first page by a typewriter (it seems), the pages had to be separated.\nThey were therefore unstapled. Once the amendment was completed,\nthey were re-stapled together for safekeeping – there would be no\nmissing pages if all of them were stapled together. 144    In\naddition, the three pages of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest\nwere unstapled when copies were made by Mr Sahagar during inspection\nof Mr Singh’s client files for the purposes of these proceedings. Again,\nthe pages were re-stapled after all the necessary photocopying was completed.\nI had no basis to doubt or disagree with Mr Singh’s explanation. 145    The\nsecond wrinkle in Mr Sahagar’s argument was that his argument was,\nto some extent, self-defeating. Taking his argument at its highest,\nif Dawood had intended to deceive the Plaintiffs by only showing\nthem the signature page of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest and not the other pages, and that he had done so on each\nof the different occasions that he presented the document to each\nof the Plaintiffs for their signature, why would the corners of\nthe pages be damaged? 146    The\nonly explanation for that is after each signing by one of the Plaintiffs,\nDawood would take the document back and staple it with the rest of\nthe pages, despite knowing that he would have to remove the pages\nagain for the next person to sign. If Dawood had intended from the\noutset to deceive the Plaintiffs by only presenting them with the\nsignature pages, he would simply have kept the signature pages of\nthe respective documents separately until all the Plaintiffs had\nsigned. There was no reason for him to remove the staple, let one\nof the Plaintiffs sign, re-staple, and repeat the process until\neveryone had signed. 147    I\nam not saying that Dawood could not have done that. Of course he could.\nBut it was far more inconvenient and unnecessary and hence more implausible\nthan Mr Singh’s explanation, which was both logical as well as credible.\nIndeed, it did not go unnoticed that Mr Sahagar’s response to Mr Singh’s\nexplanation was “I accept that’s a very fair explanation”. (7)   Noorjahan’s subsequent\nattendance at the Solicitors’ office in October 2004 148    Last\nbut not least, I noted Mr Zhulkarnain’s observation that Noorjahan\nhad attended at the Solicitors’ office in October 2004 to sign another\ndocument, the Consent to the Dispensation of Sureties of the Administrative\nBond. This document was of markedly less significance than the Deed\nof Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Mr Zhulkarnain referred\nto this fact to make the point that if the Solicitors had thought\nit necessary for Noorjahan to sign this document, which was of relatively\nless importance, in their presence, based on the same practice of\ntheirs, they would not have allowed the Deed of Renunciation of\nBeneficial Interest, a substantially more important document, to\nhave been signed outside of their presence despite the Plaintiffs’\ndeclaration to the contrary. 149    Moreover,\nit was not disputed that Noorjahan had attended at the Solicitors’\noffice in October 2004 to sign this document. Noorjahan admitted\nthis freely during her cross-examination. She even explained why she\nwas certain she had gone to their office in October 2004. Noorjahan took\npains to explain this point because she had previously stated that\nshe had signed some documents in the Solicitors’ office on February\n2004 but this version was clearly inconsistent with Mother and Aysha’s\n(though it was consistent with Dawood and the Solicitors’ version). 150    If\nthe Plaintiffs were right, and the practice was that legal documents would\nbe left by Dawood at home with Mother for the siblings to sign as and\nwhen they came to visit Mother, Noorjahan would not have paid a special\nvisit to the Solicitors’ office to sign the Consent to the Dispensation of\nSureties of the Administrative Bond. Ironically, Noorjahan’s insistence on\ncorrecting her erroneous recollection, that she had visited the\nSolicitors’ office in October 2004 (and not February 2004), fortified\nmy view that the Plaintiffs’ case that most of the documents were\nnot signed in front of Mr Singh was untenable. 151    To\nconclude on the manner of execution of the Deed of Renunciation of\nBeneficial Interest, I was satisfied first, that the deed was executed\nin a meeting at the Solicitors’ office on 27 February 2004 that\nwas attended by all the Plaintiffs and Dawood, and secondly, that\nthe Plaintiff Siblings had only signed the deed after the nature\nand implications of the deed had been explained to them by Mr Singh. 152    For\nall of the foregoing reasons at [70] to [151] above, I could not safely\nconclude that there was a Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement on a balance\nof probabilities. Without the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement, the Plaintiffs’\ncase had nothing further to stand on. This reason was sufficient,\non its own, to justify dismissing the Plaintiffs’ claim. Dawood’s 2004 Agreement 153    Notwithstanding\nmy decision on the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement, as mentioned right\nat the very outset, I did not accept Dawood’s version of events\nin 2004, either. Mr Zhulkarnain acknowledged, in his submissions, that\nit was open to me to reject both the Plaintiffs’ and Dawood’s characterisation\nof the events. Mr Zhulkarnain referred toLoo\nChay Sit v Estate of Loo Chay Loo, deceased[2010] 1\nSLR 286 in which the Court of Appeal said (at [21]): … The insufficiency of the evidence adduced\nto prove the fact asserted could also be a result of the adduction\nof evidence by the opposing party which undermines that assertion.\nFor instance, a party may be seeking to prove the existence of a\nparticular fact and has adduced evidence in support of it. The opposing\nparty, however, may be able to adduce some evidence as to thenon-existenceof that fact. Such evidence\nmay not be sufficient on its own for the court to conclude that,\non a balance of probabilities, the fact does not exist so as to\nbe “disproved”. Such evidence may, nevertheless, sufficiently undermine the\ncase of the party asserting the fact so as to cause doubt as to\nits existence with the result that the party is unable to discharge\nhis burden of proving the fact. As a result, the fact concerned\nis “not proved”. [emphasis in original] 154    Whilst\nthe effect of the evidence given by Dawood, namely his testimony,\nwhen placed alongside the questionable evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs\non the whole gave me sufficient cause to conclude that the existence\nof the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was “not proved”, that same evidence\nby Dawood was not so cogent that I could agree that there was an agreement\nthat existed, and that this agreement was Dawood’s 2004 Agreement.\nThe rule that he who asserts must prove also applied equally to Dawood\nas it did to the Plaintiffs. 155    The\nmain issue I had with Dawood’s 2004 Agreement was his reference\nto Father’s wishes as the genesis and motivation for Dawood’s 2004\nAgreement. 156    This\nwas first mentioned in Dawood’s AEIC, where he stated that Father\nprior to his death had informed Dawood that “the Property was to be\ntransferred to [Mother] and [Dawood] so that [Dawood] could look after\n[Mother].” Dawood was 29 years old then, unmarried, and had just been\nadmitted as a cadet with SIA. According to Dawood, the second time Father\nmentioned this wish was in January 2004, at the meeting of the family\nmembers which resulted in Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. Dawood claimed\nthat the Plaintiffs agreed to transfer the Property to Mother and Dawood’s\njoint names “in line with the wishes of [Father]”. 157    Mr\nZhulkarnain downplayed this in his submissions, to the point of almost\nmaking no mention of it. This was understandable. Nevertheless,\nas far as I was concerned, Father’s wish was an integral element\nof Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. On that count, I was doubtful that Father\never had such a wish and if so, that it meant what Dawood said it\ndid. 158    First,\napart from Dawood, none of the other Plaintiffs, including Mother,\nwas aware of this wish of Father. This may not be surprising, given that\nthe Plaintiffs and Dawood’s interests are directly opposed. However,\nat the very least, it was evident that Dawood’s oral testimony –\nwhich was unsupported by any other piece of objective evidence –\nwas self-serving. 159    Secondly,\nit was strange for Father to specifically instruct one of his four\nchildren to transfer the Property to the child and Mother’s joint\nnames upon his death, just “so that” the child can look after Mother\n(see [156] above). Again, this seemed almost too convenient to be\ntrue. I would imagine that a child taking care of his parent is\nthe norm; no further incentive or reward was needed to encourage\nthe norm. And why Father would say that to Dawood, to the exclusion\nof Jahir, for example, required some explanation. There was none. 160    Third,\nthere was hardly any cross-examination of the Plaintiffs on the existence\nof Father’s wish. If this was the source of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement\nwhich Dawood said was communicated to the Plaintiffs before they\nagreed to the terms of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement, I would have expected\nMr Zhulkarnain to have put this fact squarely to the Plaintiffs. This\ndid not take place. It was as if Mr Zhulkarnain had deliberately avoided\nthis elephant in the room. 161    Dawood\ntried to allude to the fact that Jahir inherited the mutton stall business.\nHowever, that would be comparing apples to oranges. Quite apart from\nthe absence of any figures relating to the profitability or value\nof the mutton stall business, Jahir had to work to manage or operate\nthe business while the Property was a value-accretive asset. Leaving\naside taxes and other outgoings which were factors for both the\nmutton stall business and the Property, it would seem that inheriting\nthe Property was, all things being equal, more valuable.",
        "Whether Dawood had breached\nthe Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement": "162    In\nthe light of my decision that there was no Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,\nDawood could not have breached the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement.",
        "Whether the limitation period\nwas postponed pursuant to s 29 of the Limitation Act": "163    I\nreturn to the question of postponement of the limitation period\nthat I had reserved comment on earlier (see [60] to [66] above). 164    On\nthe basis of my assessment of the facts above, it should be evident that\nMr Sahagar’s argument in relation to s 29(1) of the Limitation Act\n– whether s 29(1)(a) or s 29(1)(b) – must fail. 165    As\nI have already explained above, the evidence did not support a finding\nthat Dawood had procured the transfer surreptitiously. There was no\n“secret” act by Dawood. Although the transfer of the Property was executed\nby Dawood alone and without him informing the Plaintiffs, the basis\nof the transfer was in fact the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest\nexecuted by the Plaintiff Siblings, none of whom disputed that they had\nsigned this deed (see also [88] to [152] above). 166    Nor\ndid the evidence show that Dawood had fraudulently concealed the\nalleged breach. There was no evidence or indeed even any allegation\nby the Plaintiffs that there was concealment between 2005 and 2011,\nmuch less a fraudulent concealment. The fact that the Plaintiffs\ndid not know of the true ownership until 2011 is not in itself proof\nof concealment. 167    In\nthese circumstances, I could not see how it could be said that Dawood\nhad somehow fraudulently concealed the events leading to the transfer\nof the Property to Mother and him as joint tenants. 168    Accordingly,\nin addition to my decision that the Plaintiffs’ claim ought to be\ndismissed, their claim was in any event time-barred.",
        "Whether the lodgement of the\nCaveat was wrongful, vexatious or without reasonable cause": "169    Section\n128 of the Land Titles Act permits compensation to any party who\nsustains pecuniary loss that is attributable to a person who had\nlodged a caveat wrongfully, vexatiously or without reasonable cause. 170    InHoSoo Fong and another\nv Standard Chartered Bank[2007] 2 SLR(R) 181, the Court\nof Appeal held (at [35]) that “without reasonable cause” is present\nwhere the caveator has no honest belief based on reasonable grounds\nthat he has a caveatable interest. A “caveatable interest” simply\nmeans an interest in land which, because it is recognised by the\nlaw as such, can be availed protection by way of a caveat. Hence,\nonly persons who have an interest in land (as defined by s 4(1)\nof the Land Titles Act) may lodge a caveat over that land: seeAamnaTaseer v ShaanTaseer and others[2012] 2 SLR 348 at\n[3]. 171    On\nthe basis of my decision that there was no Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement,\nthe Plaintiff Siblings could not claim to have any interest in the Property\narising from Dawood’s breach of the Plaintiff’s 2004 Agreement. They\ncould not even have held an honest belief that they had a caveatable interest\nfrom the very beginning because, on the Plaintiffs’ own case, the terms\nof the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement was for the Property to be registered\nin Mother’s sole name. 172    In\nother words, the performance of the Plaintiffs’ 2004 Agreement would\nhave resulted in Mother being the only person with a caveatable interest\nin the Property. 173    This\nis consistent with the relief in the Plaintiffs’ Statement of Claim for\na declaration that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner\nof the Property. This foreclosed any possibility that the Plaintiff\nSiblings believed that they had a caveatable interest in the Property. 174    Accordingly,\nI held that the Plaintiff Siblings were liable for Dawood’s loss\nof $807.98 which was caused by their lodgement of the Caveat without reasonable\ncause. The loss was the sum of Dawood’s cost of obtaining legal advice\nand the amount that Dawood paid to obtain a copy of the Caveat.",
        "Other observations –non est factumand mistake": "",
        "The doctrine of non est factum": "175    In\nhis Opening Statement at the beginning of trial, Mr Zhulkarnain characterised\nthe Plaintiffs as seeking to invoke the doctrine ofnon\nest factumto disavow the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest. This was peculiar because up to that point, as far as\nI could tell,non est factumwas not\nan argument that had been mentioned by Mr Sahagar. This was later picked\nup by Mr Sahagar and was argued at some length in both sides’ closing\nsubmissions. 176    In\nsimple terms,non est factumoperates\nas an exception to the general rule that a person is bound to the\nterms of a document which he has signed, whether or not he fully\nunderstood those terms. To successfully invoke the exception, the\nperson signing the document ordinarily needs to show that he “had\nmade a fundamental mistake as to the character or effect of the\ndocument” and that the mistake was not due to negligence or carelessness\non his part:Chitty on Contractsvol\n1 (H G Beale gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 31st Ed, 2012) at paras\n5-105 to 5-107. 177    It\nwas in these circumstances that the issue ofnon\nest factumcame to be addressed in both sides’ closing\nsubmissions. Both Mr Zhulkarnain and Mr Sahagar were in agreement\nwith this description of thenon est factumdoctrine. 178    Mr\nZhulkarnain’s point was that the Plaintiffs could not avail themselves\nof the doctrine because there was no fundamental mistake as to the\ncharacter or effect of the documents, and further, the Plaintiffs\nwere at least careless in the execution of the Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest. Mr Sahagar submitted first, that the doctrine\nwas made out on the facts, but alternatively, “in any rate”, the\ndoctrine had no application because (a) ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence\nAct (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) applied; and (b) “no third party rights\nor interests were involved”. 179    I\nshall briefly address Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission first.\nTo be candid, I did not comprehend the logic of Mr Sahagar’s approach.\nThe doctrine ofnon est factumwas\nbeneficial for his clients, in the sense that it gave the Plaintiff\nSiblings a legal basis to evade the consequences of their signing\nof the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Thus, an argument\nthat the doctrine ofnon est factumdid\nnot apply runs counter to the Plaintiffs’ interest. Nevertheless,\nin fairness to the Plaintiffs, I approached it on the footing that\nthe doctrine could apply (since Mr Zhulkarnain accepted this). 180    On\nthe principal question, then, of whether the twin elements necessary\nfor a finding ofnon est factumwere\nmade out on the facts, I did not think that the Plaintiffs could\nsucceed in the light of my findings above on the manner in which\nthe Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest was executed (see\n[88]–[151] above). 181    On\nthe basis of my finding that Mr Singh had read out to and explained\nto the Plaintiffs the contents and effect of signing the Deed of Renunciation\nof Beneficial Interest, it was difficult to see how the Plaintiffs could\nprove that they had fundamentally misunderstood the nature and effect\nof the document. In my view, they did not. 182    Much\nof Mr Sahagar’s submissions onnon est factumwere\nineffectual because they flowed from his primary case which I rejected,\nthat is, the relevant documents were not executed in the Solicitors’\noffice but at home, and that the Plaintiffs had only been shown\nthe signature pages and not the other pages that set out the nature\nand description of the document. 183    Moreover,\nif the person signing the document has had the document explained\nto him by someone with the proper qualifications and skills (as happened\nin this case), barring exceptional circumstances (and there are none\nin the present case), it is highly implausible that the signatory\ncan subsequently claim that he was mistaken in thinking that the\ndocument was fundamentally different. 184    It\nwas therefore not even necessary to determine whether the mistake was\na result of the Plaintiff Siblings’ negligence or carelessness.\nBut if it came down to that, I would likewise have held that any\nmistake was attributable to the Plaintiff Siblings’ negligence or\ncarelessness in the execution of the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest. 185    The\nresult, in my view, was not at all harsh. The doctrine ofnon est factumis not meant to give contracting\nparties an easy way out of a bargain, especially one that was entered\ninto irresponsibly. Lord Wilberforce, inSaunders\nv Anglia Building Society[1971] AC 1004 (“Saunders”), the leading case onnon est factum(at 1027) said: In my opinion, the\ncorrect rule … is that … a person who signs a document, and parts\nwith it so that it may come into other hands,has a responsibility, that of the normal man of\nprudence, to take care what he signs,\nwhich, if neglected, prevents him from denying his liability under\nthe document according to its tenor. … The preceding paragraphs contemplate persons\nwho are adult and literate: the conclusion as to such persons is\nthat, while there are cases in which they may successfully plead\nnon est factum these cases will, in modern times, be rare. As to persons who are illiterate, or blind,\nor lacking in understanding, the law is in a dilemma. On the one\nhand, the law is traditionally, and rightly, ready to relieve them\nagainst hardship and imposition. On the other hand, regard has to\nbe paid to the position of innocent third parties who cannot be expected,\nand often would have no means, to know the condition or status of the\nsigner. I do not think that a defined solution can be provided for\nall cases.The law ought, in my opinion, to\ngive relief if satisfied that consent was truly lacking but willrequire of signers even in this class that they\nact responsibly and carefully according to their circumstancesin putting their signature to legal documents.\n… [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 186    It\nbears repeating the origins of the doctrine ofnon\nest factum. It was made in favour of those who are permanently\nor temporarily unable, through no fault of their own, to have without\nexplanation any real understanding of the purport of a particular\ndocument. This was a narrow class of persons who are typically unable\nto read owing to blindness or illiteracy and who therefore had to\ntrust someone to tell them what they were signing. 187    Looking\nat the Plaintiffs and the circumstances surrounding the signing\nof the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest, I did not think that\nthe Plaintiffs could avail themselves of the doctrine ofnon est factum. 188    There\nwas a further problem with any reliance by the Plaintiffs on the doctrine:\neven if it were successfully invoked, it was unclear how it would support\ntheir substantive relief that Mother is the sole legal and beneficial owner\nof the Property. All they would be able to do is to claim that the\nDeed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest is void; that on its\nown does not entitle them to their relief. There is no need for\nme to express any further observations on this issue since it is\nnow moot. 189    Before\nI leave this discussion, I should clarify that I thought Mr Sahagar’s\nreliance on ss 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act to be misconceived. 190    The\nfirst and most important point to note about ss 93 and 94 is that they\ndeal withadmissibilityof evidence.\nSection 93 thus provides how the terms of a document may be proved,\nand when evidence extrinsic to the document may be admitted for\nthat purpose: 93.    When\nthe terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of\nproperty have been reduced by or by consent of the parties to the\nform of a document, and in all cases in which any matter is required\nby law to be reduced to the form of a document,no\nevidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract,\ngrant or other disposition of property or of such matter except\nthe document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in cases\nin which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions of\nthis Act. [emphasis added] 191    If\nthe terms of the instrument have been proved according to s 93,\ns 94 states that no evidence of any oral agreement or statement\nshall be admitted as between the parties to the instrument for the\npurpose of contradicting, varying, adding to, or subtracting from\nits terms. This general limitation is, however, qualified by six\nprovisos in s 94. It is proviso (a) that Mr Sahagar referenced in\nsupport of his argument that the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial\nInterest may be set aside without recourse to the doctrine ofnon est factum. 192    Proviso\n(a) reads: any fact may be provedwhich\nwould invalidate any document or which would entitle any person\nto any decree or order relating thereto; such as fraud, intimidation,\nillegality, want of due execution, want of capacity in any contracting\nparty, the fact that it is wrongly dated, want or failure of consideration,\nor mistake in fact or law … [emphasis added] 193    From\nthe opening words of the proviso, it was clear what the function of\nthe proviso was. It provided an exception to the general limitation against\nadmissibility of evidence of any oral agreement or statement. In other\nwords, any fact that supports an argument that the instrument ought to\nbe invalidated may be admitted, notwithstanding the general limitation. Thus,\nfacts relating to fraud, intimidation, illegality, want of due execution, capacity,\nthe date of the instrument, failure of consideration, and mistake\nin fact or law, all of which are explicitly mentioned in proviso\n(a), are admissible as evidence. 194    As\nprovisions which merely govern the admissibility of evidence, ss\n93 and 94(a) do not contain or manifest any principle of law that\nallows for the invalidation of an instrument. They therefore do\nnot provide any substantive legal basis for the setting aside of\nthe Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. It was for this\nreason that I considered Mr Sahagar’s alternative submission, that\nthe doctrine ofnon est factumdid\nnot apply, rather curious (see [179] above).",
        "Mistake": "195    On\nthe basis of the foregoing, there is very little left to be said\nabout the possibility of invoking the doctrine of unilateral mistake\nto void the Deed of Renunciation of Beneficial Interest. Simply\nput, I did not think that as a matter of fact, the Plaintiffs were\nmistaken as to the nature and effect of their signature on the document.",
        "Conclusion": "196    For\nthe foregoing reasons, I dismissed the Plaintiffs’ claims in their entirety\nand allowed Dawood’s counterclaim for damages of $807.98 from the\nPlaintiff Siblings in respect of their lodgement of the Caveat without reasonable\ncause. 197    In\nterms of costs, I limited the Plaintiffs’ liability to 70% of Dawood’s costs.\nThis was to reflect my rejection of a major plank of Dawood’s case theory,\nnamely, the existence of Dawood’s 2004 Agreement. I ordered that the\nPlaintiffs pay Dawood’s costs, to be taxed if not agreed within\n14 days of my oral judgment."
