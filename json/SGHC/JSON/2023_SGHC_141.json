        "The parties": "1 The Appellant in HC/DCA 29/2022 is Auto Lease Pte Ltd (“Third Party” or “Auto Lease”), a Singapore registered finance company that is primarily in the business of granting hire-purchase loans for the financing of vehicle purchases.1Foot Note 1×Record of Appeal at p21 Para 9.The Appellant was joined as third party in the proceedings before the district courts in DC/DC 679/2020. Mr Lim Woon Cheng Anthony (“Mr Lim”) is the director of Auto Lease. 2 The 1st Respondent is San Hup Bee Motor LLP (the “1stRespondent”), a Singapore registered limited liability partnership in the business of selling vehicles on a consignment basis.2Foot Note 2×Record of Appeal at p665 Para 5.The partners of the 1st Respondent were one Mr. Toh See Leong and one Doris Chan Yun Zhen (“Doris”)3Foot Note 3×Record of Appeal at p21 Para 7., until the former’s death on 27 October 2017.4Foot Note 4×Record of Appeal at p275 ln 15 to ln 20.In the trial below, the 1st Respondent was named as the 2nd Defendant.5Foot Note 5×Record of Appeal at p13. 3 The 2nd Respondent is San Hup Bee (S) Pte Ltd (the “2ndRespondent”), a Singapore-registered private limited company that carries on business as a used car dealer.6Foot Note 6×Record of Appeal at p674 Para 4.The 2nd Respondent sells vehicles purchased from third parties and also sells vehicles on behalf of third parties on a consignment basis. In the trial below, the 2nd Respondent was named as the 1st Defendant.7Foot Note 7×Record of Appeal at p13.The sole director and shareholder of the 2nd Respondent is one Jaxon Toh Jun Sheng (“Jaxon”). Jaxon is the son of Mr Toh See Leong and Doris.8Foot Note 8×Record of Appeal at p21 Para 6. 4 Prior to his death, Mr Toh See Leong was also the sole director and shareholder of another Singapore-registered company called San Hup Bee Motoring Pte Ltd (“SHB Motoring”). SHB Motoring is a separate entity from the 1st and 2nd Respondents.9Foot Note 9×Record of Appeal at p21 Para 8. 5 The 3rd Respondent is Toh Beng Hock (Zhuo Mingfu) t/a V-Tech Auto Service (the “3rdRespondent”), a sole proprietorship in the business of the repair and maintenance of motor vehicles, and the provision of passenger land transport.10Foot Note 10×Record of Appeal at p20 Para 5.In this written judgment, I use the term “3rd Respondent” to refer both to the sole proprietorship V-Tech Auto Service and to Mr Toh Beng Hock himself.",
        "Background to the dispute": "6 The dispute below involved the alleged breach of two separate contracts, both relating to the sale and purchase of a Toyota HiAce Commuter GL2.7A bearing registration number SKC1131C (the “Vehicle”).11Foot Note 11×Record of Appeal at p19 Para 1.The first of the two contracts was a sales agreement (the “Sales Agreement”), whereby the 3rd Respondent agreed to purchase from the 2nd Respondent the Vehicle at the price of $52,200 (the “Purchase Price”). The Vehicle was sold on a consignment basis by the 2nd Respondent on behalf of the 1st Respondent.12Foot Note 12×Record of Appeal at p22 Para 10.For the purposes of the Sales Agreement, the parties and the trial judge (the “DJ”) treated the 1st and 2nd Respondents as joint sellers of the Vehicle.13Foot Note 13×Record of Appeal at p22 Para 13. 7 In the trial below, the 3rd Respondent took the position that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had breached the Sales Agreement in failing to ensure that all encumbrances over the Vehicle were removed so that legal title and/or ownership of the Vehicle could be duly transferred to the 3rd Respondent.14Foot Note 14×Record of Appeal at p25 Para 21.The 3rd Respondent asserted that despite having paid the full purchase price of $52,200, including a sum of $49,200.86 which he paid to the Appellant in full settlement of the hire-purchase loan outstanding on the Vehicle, he had found himself unable to register the transfer of ownership of the Vehicle on the Land Transport Authority’s (“LTA”) online system because the 1st and 2nd Respondents had “failed to obtain and present to [LTA] any evidence that the vehicle [was] not under financing”.15Foot Note 15×Record of Appeal at p 695-700 Para 6-22. 8 The second contract was a hire purchase agreement (the “Hire Purchase Agreement”) between the Appellant and the 1st Respondent. The Vehicle was financed by the Appellant. It was not disputed that of all the parties, the Appellant was the only one that was a member of the Hire Purchase Finance and Leasing Association of Singapore (“HPFLAS”). 9 In the trial below, the 1st and 2nd Respondents took the position that the Appellant had breached the Hire Purchase Agreement by wrongfully misapplying monies received from the 3rd Respondent in respect of the settlement of the hire-purchase loan outstanding on the Vehicle. It was not disputed that the Appellant had appropriated a sum of $13,301 out of the total sum of $49,200.86 paid by the 3rd Respondent and applied this sum of $13,301 towards partial set-off of debts owed to the Appellant bySHB Motoring.16Foot Note 16×Record of Appeal at p29 Para 31; Record of Appeal at p577-578 Para 11.The Appellant claimed that he was entitled to do so because according to him, he had been dealing with Mr Toh See Leong for “more than ten years”, and had noted that the latter would deal with him using both SHB Motoring and the 1st Respondent. 10 The 1st and 2nd Respondents asserted that the Appellant had no right under the Hire Purchase Agreement to use monies paid to settle the outstanding hire purchase loan for the set-off of debts owed by SHB Motoring. Further, having wrongfully applied the sum of $13,301 towards partial set-off of debts owed by SHB Motoring, the Appellant had failed to take steps to lodge the HPFLAS Form B with LTA to confirm that the Vehicle was no longer under financing. This meant that the HPFLAS Form A – which indicated that the Vehicle was under financing – remained in LTA’s records. The 1st and 2nd Respondents took the position that the Appellant’s failure to lodge Form B effectively prevented the transfer of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent in LTA’s records.17Foot Note 17×Record of Appeal at p29 Para 31.As such, the 1st and 2nd Respondents contended that they were entitled to a contribution or an indemnity from the Appellant for all losses for which the 1st and 2nd Respondents were held liable to the 3rd Respondent.18Foot Note 18×Record of Appeal at p31 Para 35.",
        "The decision below": "11 In respect of the 3rd Respondent’s claim against the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the DJ found that it was an implied term of the Sales Agreement that the Respondents would procure and/or ensure the transfer of legal ownership and title over the Vehicle, free of any encumbrances, to the 3rd Respondent.19Foot Note 19×Record of Appeal at p36 Para 43-44.As there was plainly a failure to procure the transfer of legal title free of all encumbrances, the 1st and 2nd Respondents were in breach of their contractual obligations20Foot Note 20×Record of Appeal at p38 Para 47.and were liable to the 3rd Respondent for damages.21Foot Note 21×Record of Appeal at p44 Para 63. 12 In respect of the third party proceedings, the DJ found that the Appellant had acted in breach of the Hire Purchase Agreement with the 1st Respondent, by improperly applying part of the payment received from the 3rd Respondent to set off amounts owing from SHB Motoring, a separate entity wholly unrelated to the transaction.22Foot Note 22×Record of Appeal at p54 Para 85.The Appellant had also failed to remove the encumbrance over the Vehicle despite having received full payment of the outstanding hire-purchase loan amount for the Vehicle. The DJ held that the Appellant had through his conduct caused the 1st and 2nd Respondents to breach the Sales Agreement with the 3rd Respondent, and that the Appellant must indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents in full for any damages awarded to the 3rd Respondent.23Foot Note 23×Record of Appeal at p55 Para 86. 13 The DJ therefore gave judgment for the 3rd Respondent against the 1st and 2nd Respondents for damages which he assessed at $16,500, with interest thereon and costs fixed at $10,000 (excluding disbursements). He further ordered the Appellant, as the third party, to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the full extent of the sums payable by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the 3rd Respondent (including costs and disbursements). The costs of the third party proceedings were awarded to the 1st and 2nd Respondents and fixed at $20,000 (excluding disbursements). 14 The Appellant appealed against “the whole of the decision of [the DJ]”.24Foot Note 24×Record of Appeal at p5-6.",
        "The parties’ cases on appeal": "15 I summarise below the parties’ respective cases on appeal.",
        "Appellant’s Case": "219 The Appellant claimed that it had refused to file Form B because there were monies outstanding from the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the Appellant.Perthe Appellant’s reasoning, the DJ did not actually rule that the Appellant’s claim of a debt owed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents was frivolous. Moreover, in assessing the issue of mitigation, the DJ had suggested that the 3rd Respondent should have paid the outstanding debt of $13,301 to the Appellant and claimed this in turn from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. On this basis, the Appellant argued, it must have had a legitimate right to hold back the filing of the Form B.156Foot Note 156×Appellant’s Case at Paras 89-90.",
        "1st and 2nd Respondents’ Case": "20 The 2nd Respondent limited its arguments in this appeal to a rebuttal of the Appellant’s submissions on the DJ’s alleged error in holding the Appellant liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The 1st Respondent adopted the same position as the 2nd Respondent.",
        "3rd Respondent’s Case": "221 The 3rd Respondent too agreed with the DJ’s reasoning. In particular, the 3rd Respondent submitted that the DJ had correctly found the Appellant to be in breach of the Hire Purchase Agreement as a result of its wrongful use of the sum of $13,301 from the 3rd Respondent’s payment of $49,200.86.162Foot Note 162×3rd Respondent’s Case at p56-57 Paras 100-101.Since the Appellant had no right to set off the $13,301 against debts owing by SHB Motoring and since there were no monies outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement, the Appellant ought to have lodged a Form B to release its charge over the Vehicle. The Appellant’s wrongful refusal to do so was the cause of the failed transfer; and the Appellant should accordingly be held liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for all sums payable to the 3rd Respondent.163Foot Note 163×3rd Respondent’s Case at p57-58 Paras 102-104.",
        "Issues to be determined": "23 The following seven issues arose for my determination: (a) Whether the Appellant hadlocus standito appeal the DJ’s decision in respect of the 3rd Respondent’s claim against the 1st and 2nd Respondents. (b) If the Appellant did have suchlocus standi, whether the DJ erred in finding that it was an implied term of the Sales Agreement that the 1st and 2nd Respondents should procure the transfer of legal title in the Vehicle, free of all encumbrances, to the 3rd Respondent. (c) Whether the existence of an entire agreement clause in the Sales Agreement precluded the DJ from implying contractual terms into the Sales Agreement. (d) Whether the DJ was correct in making the following findings as to liability: (i) That the 1st and 2nd Respondents breached their contractual obligations in failing to cause the 3rd Respondent to be registered as the owner of the Vehicle. (ii) That the cause of the failed attempts to register the 3rd Respondent as owner was the continued existence of the Form A in respect of the Vehicle, which indicated that the Vehicle was under financing, and which document the Appellant wrongfully allowed to remain in the HPFLAS System by dint of his failure to lodge a Form B. (e) Whether the quantum of damages awarded to the 3rd Respondent ($2,200 a month for loss of rental income) should be revised on appeal. (f) Whether the DJ was correct in his determination of the issue of mitigation by the 3rd Respondent. (g) Whether the Appellant should be held liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents in respect of the amounts payable by them to the 3rd Respondent. 24 In the paragraphs that follow, I address these issuesseriatim.",
        "Issue 1: Whether the Appellant hadlocus standito appeal the DJ’s decision in respect of the3rd Respondent’s claim against the 1st and 2nd Respondents": "25 On the threshold issue of the Appellant’slocus standito appeal the DJ’s decision in respect of the 3rd Respondent’s claim against the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the 3rd Respondent argued that the Appellant had no suchlocus standibecause it was not a party to the Sales Agreement on which the 3rd Respondent’s claim was based. The Appellant initially did not deal with this threshold issue in its written submissions. As this appeared to me to be a material issue, I directed all parties to put in further written submissions; and I also drew parties’ attention to the English and Australian authorities on this issue. 26 I first begin by outlining the Appellant’s and the 3rd Respondent’s further submissions on the threshold issue oflocus standi.",
        "My Decision": "Mitigation of loss: (1) Whether the 3rd Respondent should have adopted either of the mitigation strategies suggested by the DJ 174 I start with the last point first. To recapitulate: the DJ found that for the purposes of mitigating its losses, there were two options, either of which the 3rd Respondent could and should have taken. The DJ opined that the 3rd Respondent could have sought the 1st Respondent’s help to lease out the Vehicle while the Vehicle remained registered to the 1st Respondent, and that any attendant expenses could have been recovered at a later stage from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Alternatively, the DJ opined that the 3rd Respondent could have first paid the Appellant an additional sum of $13,301 to cover the balance allegedly still owing under the Hire-Purchase Agreement. The DJ reasoned that this would have allowed the 3rd Respondent to recover the vehicle first, before subsequently seeking to recover from the 1st and 2nd Respondents the monies paid. 175 I disagree with the DJ’s findings as to how the 3rd Respondent should have mitigated his loss. My reasons are as follows. 176 It is trite that the reasonableness of a claimant’s attempts to mitigate its loss is a question of fact (Andrew Phanget al,The Law of Contract in Singapore, vol.2, Academy Publishing (“Phang on Contractvol.2”) at para 22.143), and that the burden of proof is on the promisor-in-breach to show that the claimant’s post-breach actions or inaction were or was unreasonable (Phang on Contractat [22.144]). In this respect, the standard of proof required of the promisor-in-breach is rather high (Phang on Contractat [22.145]): inThe Asia Star(at [24]), the CA stressed that this burden “is ordinarily one which is not easily discharged”. 177 InThe Asia Star, in a passage cited by the DJ in his grounds of decision, the CA also held (at [47]) that in terms of action taken in mitigation, an aggrieved party should not be expected to incur great expense or to incur too great a risk of its money: It is, of course, axiomatic that the duty to mitigate has its limits. It cannot oblige an aggrieved party to incur great expense or put itself to great inconvenience in stemming the loss resulting from the defaulting party’s breach. Thus, inLesters Leather & Skin Company, Ltd v Home & Overseas Brokers, Ltd(1948) 82 Ll L Rep 202 at 205, Lord Goddard CJ observed that, where a contract for the sale of goods was breached by the seller failing to deliver the promised goods, the prospective purchaser was not:  … bound to go hunting [all over] the globe to find out where he can get [replacement goods] and then have them shipped, months after the contract time, so that they will arrive [at their intended destination] many months after the date [on] which, had they been shipped in accordance with the contract, they would have arrived.  In this regard, it is important to bear in mind that it is always a question of fact as to what amounts to too great an expense for the aggrieved party to incur or too great a risk of its money. 178 Similar observations were made by Warren L H Khoo HJ inTan SooLeng David v Lim Thian Chai Charles[1998] 1 SLR(R) 880 (at [38]): I need only make two observations. The rule of mitigation of damages does not require the innocent party to do more than is reasonably required to stem the loss. As it is the party in default who has brought about a situation which calls for measures to mitigate loss, he is in no position to be astute in criticising the adequacy of the mitigating steps taken by the innocent party. As Lord MacMillan said inBanco de Portugal vWaterlow and Sons, Limited[1932] AC 452 at 506, the measures which the innocent party may be driven to adopt ought not to be weighed in nice scales at the instance of the defendant whose breach of contract has occasioned the difficulty. 179 Having regard to the above principles, I am unable to agree with the DJ that it would have been reasonable for the 3rd Respondent to adopt either of the two mitigation strategies suggested by him. In respect of the first option suggested by the DJ (ie,for the 3rd Respondent to seek the assistance of the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents to lease out the Vehicle before recovering any attendant expenses from the 1st and 2nd Respondents), this was far from being a straightforward process. This option would have entailed the 3rd Respondent putting in considerable effort as well as incurring the risks and the costs of seeking the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ assistance to lease out the Vehicle. This would have included incurring the costs and expenses of putting the Vehicle out in the market for leasing, bearing the risk of it not being leased out successfully, and bearing the risks and costs associated with any subsequent attempt to claim such costs and expenses from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. With respect, I do not see how it would have been reasonable for the 3rd Respondent to carry out all these steps for the purposes of mitigation. As Prakash J (as she then was) pointed out in the High Court decision inThe Asia Star[2009] SGHC 91 (at [65]), “mitigation principles do not require the injured party to incur extraordinary expenditure or act otherwise than in the ordinary course of business”. In my view, the 3rd Respondent could not and should not have been expected to take the above steps in the ordinary course of business. 180 As for the second option suggested by the DJ (ie,for the 3rd Respondent to pay an additional $13,301 to the Appellant first in order to get the charge over the Vehicle released and then subsequently to seek recovery of the money from the 1st and 2nd Respondents), I am also of the view that the 3rd Respondent could not and should not have been expected to take such steps in the ordinary course of business. Basically, this second option would have entailed the 3rd Respondent incurring too great a risk of its money, since it required him to be out of pocket for a further $13,301 – despite having paid the full purchase price of $52,200 for the Vehicle – and then to incur yet more costs by undertaking the risky process of claiming the money back from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. As the 3rd Respondent pointed out,133Foot Note 133×3rd Respondent’s Case at p 49.if the risk of losing the lawsuit materialised and the 3rd Respondent failed to recover the additional $13,301 paid out, “he would have paid a lot more for the Vehicle than he should [have], which does not make any sense, let alone business sense”. The 3rd Respondent’s point is all the more forceful when one considers that the sum of $13,301, which the DJ suggested the 3rd Respondent should pay first, would have constituted a significant portion of the entire purchase price of $52,200 – about a quarter of that price, in fact.134Foot Note 134×3rd Respondent’s Case at p 49. (2) Whether the 3rd Respondent should have already acted earlier in March 2018 by adopting either of the two mitigation strategies suggested by the DJ 181 In its arguments on appeal, the Appellant contended that it was not clear from the DJ’s grounds of decision when either of the two mitigation strategies he suggested should have been adopted by the 3rd Respondent. The Appellant argued that the 3rd Respondent should have adopted either of the mitigation strategies by March 2018, when it first found itself unable to effect transfer of ownership of the Vehicle.135Foot Note 135×Appellant’s Case at Para 86.In making this argument, the Appellant failed to put forward any coherent reasons as towhythe 3rd Respondent should have done so byMarch2018. The only faint argument the Appellant appeared to make in this respect touched on the 3rd Respondent’s purported ability to carry out such steps as at March 2018136Foot Note 136×Appellant’s Case at Paras 86-87.– which is wholly irrelevant to the issue of the reasonableness of the 3rd Respondent’s attempts to mitigate its loss. 182 In any event, given that I have found the two mitigation strategies suggested by the DJ to be unreasonable, the Appellant’s submission on this point has no more force and I reject it accordingly. (3) Whether the quantum of damages awarded to the 3rd Respondent for loss of rental was correct 183 I next address the parties’ submissions on the quantum of damages awarded for loss of rental. To recapitulate: the Appellant contended that the DJ should have awarded at the most damages for the period up till end-September 2018. The Appellant said that this was because the DJ had found insufficient evidence of mitigation by the 3rd Respondent post 25 September 2018: as such, there was no basis for the DJ to award damages for loss of rental up to end-October 2018.137Foot Note 137×Appellant’s Case at Paras 80-81.The 3rd Respondent, on the other hand, urged the appellate court to make an upward adjustment in the quantum of damages awarded, by awarding damages for a period longer than that assessed by the DJ. The 3rd Respondent submitted that the DJ was wrong to have found that he failed to pursue the matter actively after September 2018 when in truth his pursuit of the matter had simply taken a different form (ie, through his lawyers as opposed to his personal efforts).138Foot Note 138×3rd Respondent’s Case at p 41-42. 184 The Appellant objected to the 3rd Respondent’s submission for an upward adjustment in the quantum of damages, arguing that the 3rd Respondent should not be permitted to raise the point in the absence of a cross-appeal.139Foot Note 139×Transcript of 2 February 2023 at p 57 ln 3 to p 57 ln 26. (A) Whether the appellate court may adjust the quantum of damages in favour of the 3rd Respondent in the absence of a cross-appeal 185 On the issue of whether the appellate court may adjust the quantum of damages in favour of the 3rd Respondent in the absence of a cross-appeal, I find the Appellant’s objections to be without merit. 186 The relevant provisions are s 22 read with s 37(5) and (6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 332, 2007 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) as well as O 55D r 11(2) and (3) ROC. For ease of reference, I reproduce below s 22, s 37(5) and (6) SCJA: Powers of rehearing 22.– (1) All appeals to the High Court in the exercise of its appellate civil jurisdiction shall be by way of rehearing. (2) The High Court shall have the like powers and jurisdiction on the hearing of such appeals as the Court of Appeal has on the hearing of appeals from the High Court.  Hearing of appeals 37.– … (5) The Court of Appeal may draw inferences of facts, and give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and make such further or other orders as the case requires. (6) The powers in this section may be exercised notwithstanding that the notice of appeal relates only to part of the decision, and such powers may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although the respondents or parties have not appealed from or complained of the decision. 187 I also reproduce below O 55D r 11(2) and (3) ROC: General powers of Court (O.55D, r.11) 11. – (2) The High Court shall have power to draw inferences of fact and to give any judgment and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and to make such further or other order as the case may require. (3) The powers of the High Court under paragraphs (1) and (2) may be exercised notwithstanding that – (a) no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the Court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that Court; or (b) any ground for allowing the appeal or for affirming or varying the decision of that Court is not specified in any of the Cases filed pursuant to Rule 7 or 9, and the High Court may make any order, on such terms as the High Court thinks just, to ensure the determination on the merits of the real question in controversy between the parties. 188 Reading s 22, s 37(5) and (6) of the SCJA together, it is clear that this court has the same powers and jurisdiction relating to the hearing of the present appeal as the CA has on the hearing of appeals from the High Court. The relevant powers and jurisdiction of the CA are that the CA may give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made –notwithstandingthat the respondents or parties have not appealed from or complained of the decision. Accordingly, notwithstanding the 3rd Respondent’s failure to file a cross-appeal on the issue of quantum of damages, this court has the power and jurisdiction to consider the issue and to make a decision to adjust the quantum in the 3rd Respondent’s favour – should the merits of the case warrant such a decision. 189 A reading of O 55D r 11(2) and (3) ROC leads to the same conclusion. Reading O 55D r 11(2) and (3) together, it is clear that the High Court has the power to give any judgment and make such further or other order as the case requires –notwithstanding that no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that the court below. 190 The authorities in this area bear out the above interpretation. InHoban Steven Maurice Dixon and another v Scanlon Graeme John and others[2007] 2 SLR(R) 770 (“Hoban”), the CA was concerned with the application of O 57 r 13(3) and (4) ROC – which are a mirror of the provisions in O 55D r 11(2) and (3), save that O 57 r 13(3) and (4) relate to the CA instead of the High Court. InHoban, the CA held (at [30]) that: …Neither side appears to have appreciated the implication of a positive answer to our question, which would be that the June 2004 Order would not take effect, with the result that the parties would be restored to the status quo ante and the appellants would be free to litigate the issue of oppression. If they did, they have not articulated it. That would explain why the appellants continued to argue that the trial judge was wrong in not adjusting the nil valuation and that this court should do so, and the First and Second Respondents continued to argue that the trial judge was correct in not adjusting the nil valuation, and it would be a great injustice to them if this court were to do so. 191 As the CA went on to find that the June 2004 Order could not be implemented according to its terms, it had to consider whether the court had the power to make an appropriate consequential order. Citing an older version of the SCJA and ROC which wereinpari materiawith the present versions (at [186]-[187]), the CA held noted (at [45]) that: In view of our finding that the June 2004 Order cannot be implemented according to its terms, we need to consider how we can give effect to it, and whether we have the power to make an appropriate consequential order. In our view, we have the power to do so pursuant to ss 37(5) and 37(6) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SCJA”) and O 57 rr 13(3) and 13(4) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). Sections 37(5) and 37(6) of the SCJA provide as follows:  (5)    The Court of Appeal may draw inferences of facts, and give any judgment, and make any order which ought to have been given or made, and make such further or other orders as the case requires.  (6)    The powers in this section may be exercised notwithstanding that the notice of appeal relates only to part of the decision, and such powers may also be exercised in favour of all or any of the respondents or parties, although the respondents or parties have not appealed from or complained of the decision.  Order 57 rr 13(3) and 13(4) of the ROC further provide that the power to “make such further or other orders as the case requires” may be exercised even though no notice of appeal has been given in respect of any particular part of the decision of the court below or by any particular party to the proceedings in that court, or no ground for allowing the appeal or for affirming or varying the decision of that court is specified in any of the Cases filed pursuant to O 57 r 9A or r 10 of the ROC. 192 Following from its reasoning, the CA declared the June 2004 Order inoperative – notwithstanding that neither party had made submissions on the order becoming inoperative. 193 For the reasons explained above, therefore, I am satisfied that it is open to me to consider the issue of quantum of damages and to decide this issue in the 3rd Respondent’s favour – should the merits of the case warrant such a decision. (B) Power of appellate court to alter the amount of damages awarded by the judge below 194 In considering this issue, I note that an appellate court may vary the quantum of damages awarded by the judge only if it is shown that the latter: (a) acted on the wrong principles; (b) misapprehended the facts; or (c) had for these or other reasons made a wholly erroneous estimate of the damages (MinichitBunhom v Jazali bin Kastari and another[2018] 1 SLR 1037 at [28];Tan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David[2013] SGCA 48 at [7];Singapore Airlines Ltd v TanShwu Leng[2001] 3 SLR(R) 439 at [11]-[13]). 195 While the cases cited were decisions by the CA, these principles similarly apply to an appeal from the State Courts to the High Court. As I pointed out earlier (at [186]), s 22 SCJA makes it clear that in appeals heard by the High Court in exercise of its appellate civil jurisdiction, the High Court shall have like powers and jurisdiction that the CA has on hearing appeals from the High Court. (4) Whether the DJ’s decision on quantum of damages should be varied 196 I am of the view that the quantum of damages awarded by the DJ should be varied. My reasons are as follows. 197 First, it appears to me the DJ based his inquiry into the issue of mitigation on the wrong principles. The DJ appears to have focused his inquiry on whetherthe3rd Respondentwas able to show that he had carried out reasonable mitigation. For ease of reference, I reproduce below the pertinent passages from the DJ’s grounds of decision:140Foot Note 140×Record of Appeal at p 50-51. Issue 4: Duty of Mitigation  74 The Plaintiff was further under a duty to mitigate. Though the standard required of the innocent party in discharging its duty of mitigation was not high and would not be weighed on fine scales, this standard would be higher where the innocent party chose a path of inaction – seeThe Asia Star[2010] 2 SLR 1154 at [45].  75 On our facts, while the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report suggested that the Plaintiff took active steps to procure the transfer of the title of the Vehicle to itself up to September 2018, there was very little evidence before me to suggest that the Plaintiff was equally proactive in seeking to effect the transfer of the vehicleafterthe Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report of 24 September 2018 was filed. In the Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report, Plaintiff stated that he was informed by LTA that if the Form B were not released by 25 September 2018, LTA would proceed to release the Vehicle to him. The reason why the Vehicle was not released on 25 September 2018, and indeed by end September 2018, was never properly explained.  76 Further, what the Plaintiff did by way of mitigation post 25 September 2018, when the Form A was supposed to be released by LTA, was also not apparent from the evidence. Based on the documentary evidence, there appeared to begeneral inactionon the Plaintiff’s part after 25 September 2018, except for the commencement of various lawsuits – namely (i) MC 13861/2018 against the Plaintiff on 5 March 2019 and (ii) DC/OSS 38/2019 against Auto Lease on 5 March 2019 – which Plaintiff never followed through until the present writ action was filed in March 2020. 77 Further, in my mind,if the Plaintiff were really minded to lease out the Vehicle against the backdrop of a ready rental market for the Vehicle, various steps could have been taken by the Plaintiff to mitigate its losses arising from its inability to transfer the Vehicle to his own name in LTA’s records… … 79There was also no documentary evidence to suggest that Plaintiff continued to proactively follow up withLTA to resolve the transfer issue post September 2018. Indeed, when asked during cross examination if active steps were taken to effect the transfer in late 2018, as well as in 2019, PW1’s reply was that he ”could not remember”. … [Emphasis added] 198 From the italicised passages, it appears to me that the DJ’s focus was on the 3rd Respondent’s purported inability to produce evidence to prove he had carried out reasonable mitigation. With respect, this is the wrong approach in principle. The burden of proof is always on the promisor-in-breach – in this case, the 1st and 2nd Respondents – to satisfy the court that the claimant’s post-breach actions or inaction were or was unreasonable and worsened the claimant’s losses (Phang on Contractat para 22.144;The Asia Starat [24]). 199 I am also of the view that the DJ appears to have misapprehended the facts. In his grounds of decision, the DJ found that there “appeared to be general inaction on the Plaintiff’s part after 25 September 2018”. Although the DJ qualified this finding with a reference to “the commencement of various lawsuits – namely (i) MC 13861/2018 against the Plaintiff on 5 March 2019 and (ii) DC/OSS 38/2019 against Auto Lease on 5 March 2019”, he nevertheless took the view that there was general inaction by the 3rd Respondent post 25 September 2018 because there was no follow-through in respect of these earlier suits. 200 It should be noted that the timeline of the relevant events was as follows. 201 On 15 March 2018, the Appellant received payment for the Vehicle and issued an official receipt dated that very day.141Foot Note 141×Record of Appeal at p 675 and p 689-690. 202 On 28 August 2018, a writ of summons was issued and filed against the 2nd Respondent by the 3rd Respondent.142Foot Note 142×Record of Appeal at p 911.This was accompanied by a statement of claim dated 28 August 2018.143Foot Note 143×Record of Appeal at p 913-915. 203 On 24 September 2018, the 3rd Respondent made a police report. 204 On 5 March 2019 the 3rd Respondent filed an originating summons against the Appellant. Subsequently, on 29 March 2019, there was a hearing in respect of this originating summons.144Foot Note 144×Record of Appeal at p 917.On 24 May 2019, an Order of Court was made giving directions for this originating summons to be converted to that of an action begun by writ and for the 3rd Respondent to file his statement of claim.145Foot Note 145×Record of Appeal at p 919. 205 On 9 March 2020, the 3rd Respondent filed the present suit against the 1st and 2nd Respondents.146Foot Note 146×Record of Appeal at p 806-808. 206 As alluded to earlier, the 3rd Respondent has explained that following some six months of unsuccessful attempts to get past the impasse with the first two Respondents and the Appellant, and after several apparently futile complaints to the LTA and the police, he decided to change strategy by pursuing the matter through lawyers instead of through his personal efforts.147Foot Note 147×3rd Respondent’s Case at p40 Para 42.This was why, in the next six months between late August 2018 and early March 2019, lawsuits were commenced against the 2nd Respondent and the Appellant. In my view, given the lack of any tangible results from his attempts to pursue the transfer matter with the first two Respondents, the Appellant and even the authorities, there was nothing at all unreasonable about the 3rd Respondent subsequently adopting a strategy of resorting to legal action through his lawyers. Further, once the 3rd Respondent had appointed lawyers and handed over the matter to them, it was not unreasonable for him to refrain from pursuing the other three parties personally and/or continuing to complain to the authorities. It must be remembered, after all, that “the question which the principle of mitigation requires the court to determine is whether the mitigation measures taken by the aggrieved party were reasonable, and not whether the aggrieved party took the best possible measures to reduce its loss.” (The Asia Starat [44]). 207 What I do find unreasonable, however, is that after directions were given on 24 May 2019 for the conversion of the originating summons against the Appellant to a writ action, the 3rd Respondent failed to comply with the court’s directions – or for that matter, to take any further substantive steps in the lawsuits commenced on his behalf. This period of apparent stasis persisted until the filing of the present suit (DC/DC 679/2020) on 9 March 2020 – more than ten months after the filing of the originating summons. The 3rd Respondent has not ventured any explanation on record for this lengthy period of apparent inaction. 208 For the reasons set out above, I find that the 3rd Respondent should be awarded damages for loss of rental on the Vehicle for the period between 15 March 2018 and 24 May 2019, and then from 9 March 2020 to 20 November 2020 (when the 3rd Respondent finally acquired title to the Vehicle).148Foot Note 148×ROA at p118 ln 19 to ln 22.The breakdown of the total period of time for which loss of rental is payable by the 1st and 2nd Respondents is therefore as follows: (a) 14 months for the period of 15 March 2018 to 15 May 2019; (b) Nine days for the period of 15 May 2019 to 24 May 2019; (c) Eight months for the period of 9 March 2020 to 9 November 2020; (d) 11 days for the period of 9 November 2020 to 20 November 2020; (e) Adding (a), (b), (c) and (d), the total period is 22 months and 20 days. 209 As for the quantum of monthly rental value of the Vehicle, it will be recalled that the DJ estimated this at $2,200 a month (at [162]-[163] above). I am of the view that it was reasonable for him to do so. I have already found that he was justified in accepting Mr Lee’s evidence about the monthly rental value of $1,800 a month in respect of the Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT. As the DJ pointed out, the Toyota Harrier Premium 2.0 CVT has smaller seating capacity than the Vehicle, since it is only a five-seater, whereas the Vehicle is a seven-seater. Given the larger seating capacity of the Vehicle, it was reasonable for the DJ to apply an uplift to the $1,800 figure. The $2,200 figure which he estimated was in my view not overly generous, as it was lower than the figure which would have been obtained by an application of the “loss of use” benchmark rates in Appendix F of the State Courts Practice Directions (which apply at the rate of $100-$120 a day in motor accident cases involving a claim for damages, for cost of rental of a replacement vehicle and/or loss of use). 210 Factoring in a monthly rental value of the vehicle of $2,200, the breakdown of the rent during the relevant period is as follows: (a) 22 months of rent at $2,200/month is $48,400; (b) 20 days of rent at $2,200/month is 20/30 x $2,200 – equalling to $1,467 (rounded up to the nearest dollar); (c) Adding (a) and (b), the total amount is $48,400 + $1,467= $49,867. 211 In sum, a total amount of $49,867 should be awarded to the 3rd Respondent as damages for loss of rental. (5) The Appellant’s additional argument on mitigation by the 1st and 2nd Respondents 212 Before I leave Issue 6, I note in the interests of completeness that the Appellant has argued that Doris’s evidence showed a lack of any attempts by the 1st Respondent – as the registered owner of the Vehicle – to transfer the Vehicle on the LTA system after changes were made to the system in November 2018, which (purportedly) allowed a registered owner to effect transfer even when a vehicle was still under financing. The only attempt Doris made on 20 November 2020 resulted in the successful transfer of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent.149Foot Note 149×Appellant’s Case at Para 66.According to the Appellant, it was “surprising” that Doris on behalf of the 1st Respondent had not made any earlier attempt to effect the transfer. 213 While the Appellant’s point is not entirely clear, I understand it to be saying that the 3rd Respondent could and would have acquired legal title earlier than 20 November 2020150Foot Note 150×Record of Appeal at p118 ln 16 to ln 18; 3rd Respondent’s Case at p42 Para 52.but for the 1st Respondent’s failure to effect the transfer in the LTA system after changes were made to the system on 26 November 2018 (purportedly) allowing registered owners to effect transfers even if a vehicle continued to be under financing. 214 I do not find any merit in this argument. This point was actually addressed in detail by the 2nd Respondent in its closing submissions at trial.151Foot Note 151×Record of Appeal at p1083 Paras 112-115.In gist, the 2nd Respondent pointed out that although all parties agreed thatsomechanges took place in the LTA system on or about 26 November 2018, even Mr Lim himself was not able to confirm what these changes were.152Foot Note 152×Record of Appeal at p515 ln 4 to ln 15.Despite being asked several times about this,153Foot Note 153×Record of Appeal at p521 ln 5 to ln 9.Mr Lim was not able to say with any degree of certainty that post 26 November 2018, Form B wouldautomaticallybe lodged in the system and that the Vehicle would be capable of being transferred at any time. In other words, on the evidence available, it was simply not clear that post 26 November 2018, the 1st Respondent would have been able to effect transfer of the Vehicle even without the Appellant lodging a Form B. 215 In any event, the Appellant did not at any point argue in the trial below that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had failed to mitigate their losses vis-à-vis the 3rd Respondent. To permit the Appellant to advance such an argument at this belated stage would cause the 1st and 2nd Respondents irredeemable prejudice, since they have not had the opportunity to adduce any evidence on this point.",
        "Issues 2 to 7:": "",
        "General principles governing an appellate court’s review of a trial judge’s decision": "69 Before dealing with the other issues in this appeal, I first summarise the principles applicable in an appellate court’s review of a trial judge’s decision. In respect of findings of fact made by a trial judge, appellate intervention is generally only warranted when the trial judge’s assessment is plainly wrong or manifestly against the weight of the evidence (Nambu PVD Pte Ltd v UBTS Pte Ltd and another appeal[2022] 1 SLR 391at [8];Tat Seng Machine Movers Pte Ltd vOrix Leasing Singapore Ltd[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 (“Tat Seng”)at [41];TuitiongeniusPte Ltd v Toh Yew Keat and another[2021] 1 SLR 231 at [19];North Star (S) Capital Pte Ltd v Yip Fook Meng[2022] 1 SLR 677 at [21]). This is because the trial judge is generally better placed to assess the credibility of witnesses, especially where oral evidence is concerned. The CA inTat Seng(at [41]) has also clarified that where a finding of fact is not based on the veracity or credibility of the witness, but is instead based on an inference drawn from the facts or from an evaluation of the facts, the appellate court is in as good a position as the trial judge to undertake the exercise. This involves the appellate court evaluating the cogency of the evidence given by the witnesses by testing it against inherent probabilities or uncontroverted facts. 70 In respect of errors of law, the CA inNg Eng Ghee and others v MamataKapildev Dave and others (Horizon Partners (Pte Ltd, intervener) and another appeal[2009] 3 SLR(R) 109 (at [90]), citingHalsbury’s Laws of Englandvol 1(1) (Butterworths, 4th Ed Reissue, 1989) at para 70) listed the various types of errors of law which would warrant appellate intervention (see alsoMu Qi and another v Management Corporation Strata Plan No 1849[2021] 5 SLR 1401 at [34];Wu Chiu Lin v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2874[2018] 4 SLR 966 at [31];Axis Law Corp v Intellectual Property Office of Singapore[2016] 4 SLR 554 at [61]): Errors of law includemisinterpretation of a statuteor any other legal documentor a rule of common law;asking oneself and answering the wrong question, taking irrelevant considerations into account or failing to take relevant considerations into account when purporting to apply the law to the facts; admitting inadmissible evidence orrejecting admissible and relevant evidence; exercising a discretion on the basis of incorrect legal principles;giving reasons which disclose faulty legal reasoningor which are inadequate to fulfil an express duty to give reasons, andmisdirecting oneself as to the burden of proof.

        "Issue 2: Whether the DJ erred in implying terms into the Sales Agreement, given that implied terms were not pleaded by the 3rd Respondent": "71 I consider first Issue 2, which concerns the Appellant’s argument that the DJ erred in finding that an implied term in the Sales Agreement required the 1st and/or 2nd Respondents to procure and/or ensure the transfer of legal ownership and title over the Vehicle, free of any encumbrances, to the 3rd Respondent. The Appellant’s argument was principally based on alleged defects in the 3rd Respondent’s pleadings. I summarise below the Appellant’s and the 3rd Respondent’s submissions on this issue.",
        "Issue 3: Whether the existence of an entire agreement clause in the Sales Agreement precluded the DJ from implying terms into the Sales Agreement": "87 I next address the Appellant’s submission on the effect of an entire agreement clause in the Sales Agreement. I first summarise the Appellant’s and 3rd Respondent’s respective positions.",
        "Issue 4: Whether the DJ was correct in making the following findings as to liability: (i) that the 1st and 2nd Respondents breached their contractual obligations in failing to cause the 3rd Respondent to be registered as the owner of the Vehicle; (ii) that the cause of the failed attempts to register the 3rd Respondent as owner was the continued existence of Form A in respect of the Vehicle due to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to lodge a Form B": "101 Having found that the implied term in the Sales Agreement obliged the 1st and 2nd Respondents to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances, I turn next to Issue 4, which concerns the issue of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ liability to the 3rd Respondent for the breach of this implied term. In the course of the trial, it was not disputed that in deciding as between these two sets of parties, a key factual issue which the DJ had to determine was the reason for the 3rd Respondent’s unsuccessful attempts to register the transfer of ownership following his purchase of the Vehicle. If the evidence showed that the reason for the failure of the transfer was the 3rd Respondent’s own acts or omissions, then the 3rd Respondent could not blame the 1st and 2nd Respondents. However, if the evidence showed that the failure of the transfer was not due to the 3rd Respondent’s own doing, it would follow that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had failed to meet their obligation to procure and/or transfer legal ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent free from encumbrances. 102 In this connection, the DJ had to consider whether the failed transfer was caused by the continued existence of Form A in the HPFLAS system due to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to lodge a Form B (as the 3rd Respondent alleged) – or whether it was caused by the 3rd Respondent’s own acts or omissions (as the 1st and 2nd Respondents alleged) or whether it was caused by all three Respondents’ own acts or omissions (as the Appellant alleged).54Foot Note 54×Record of Appeal at p1042 Para 5b, p1095-1097 Paras 12-23.It will be remembered that the DJ decided that the failed transfer was caused by the former, and that it was not in any way due to any acts or omissions on the 3rd Respondent’s part. The DJ observed that it was unlikely for the 3rd Respondent – who was in the businessinter aliaof leasing out cars and who had paid good money for the Vehicle – to have omitted to take proper steps to register the transfer.55Foot Note 55×Record of Appeal at p39 Para 50.In the DJ’s view, this observation was supported by evidence of the active steps taken by the 3rd Respondent in his attempts to effect the transfer of ownership: these active steps include lodging a police report and seeking LTA assistance to transfer ownership of the Vehicle.56Foot Note 56×Record of Appeal at p39-40 Paras 50-53.Notwithstanding the active steps taken by the 3rd Respondent, the transfer of ownership in LTA’s records had failed; and the DJ found that this was because of the existence of the Form A which indicated a pre-existing encumbrance over the Vehicle. Given these findings, the DJ held that the 1st and 2nd Respondents must be said to have breached the implied term in the Sales Agreement which required the transfer of full ownership and title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent without any encumbrance.57Foot Note 57×Record of Appeal at p38 Para 47. 103 In challenging the above findings on appeal, the Appellant argued first of all that these findings were flawed as they were based on inadmissible hearsay evidence in the form of the contents of the 3rd Respondent’s police report.58Foot Note 58×Record of Appeal at p711.",
        "Whether the DJ erred in taking into consideration the contents of the 3rd Respondent’s police report": "104 I summarise below the portions of the DJ’s grounds of decision relating to his reliance on the police report, as well as the Appellant’s and the 3rd Respondent’s respective arguments on the issue of his alleged error in relying on inadmissible hearsay evidence. Decision below 105 The DJ relied on the police incident report to find that the 3rd Respondent had taken active steps to procure the transfer of ownership in LTA’s records.59Foot Note 59×Record of Appeal at p37 Para 46.I set out below the relevant portion of the DJ’s grounds of decision: 46 The evidence adduced at trial suggested that the Plaintiff [3rd Respondent] took active steps to procure the transfer of ownership of LTA’s records. The police incident lodged by the Plaintiff [3rd Respondent] on 24 September 2018 (the “Plaintiff’s Police Incident Report”) indicated that the Plaintiff [3rd Respondent] took active steps to effect the transfer, including: (a) making repeated calls to LTA to seek assistance; (b) sending lawyer’s letters to the Defendants [1st and 2nd Respondents]; and (c) lodging police reports seeking the police’s assistance in resolving this matter… The relevant parts of the police incident report were also reproduced by the DJ as follows: 46 … “I am writing this letter for seeking the serious assistance and support from LTA for the case as following: On 09/03/2018, I bought a vehicle SKC1131C from San Hup Bee(s) P/L at the price of $52,000.00… … On 14/03/2018 at 12PM, I collected the car and paid the full settlement $49,200.86 to Auto lease Pte Ltd … and balance $1,999.14 to San Hup Bee (S) P/L ….. I was advised that the car could be transferred after 5 days by a ESA. I made an effort to transfer ownership quite [sic] some times but not eligible to transfer. I called Auto lease Pte Ltd advised to ask San Hup Bee as Sales [sic] Agreement [sic] with them not with Auto lease ….. After many days of investigating, I found out ….. SKC 1131C was not belongs to San Hup Bee (s) Pte Ltd but under San Hup Bee Motor LLP which had some old debt with Auto Lease so that Auto lease didn’t release Form B what is necessary requirement for the transfer ownership. I wished to make the police report at Jurong Police Station but were advised that the car was handovered to me by San hup bee so no report recorded. I called LTA on 11/04/2018 (Mr Rizal) ), on 12/04/2018 (Ming Leong), 12/04/2018 (Rodnang Chua). All replied to wait till Ms Janet called me back and said that she couldn’t do anything as this is under finance company (Auto lease). With an disappointment, I looked for the lawyer firm and summon letter sent to San Hup Bee on 06/06/2018, no reply from them, sent again on 30/08/2018 (writ of summons). San Hup Bee’s lawyer reply on 19/09/2018 that they already give me all the transfer documents (PIN from M01) and finished their duties for sales agreement. So I called LTA on 20/09/2018 (Haz) at 11am said Officer will call back by 20/09/2018 but I still not received any return calls so I called again on 20/09/2018 at 17.30pm and get the return call from Trina on 21/096/2018 10.30am. She was helpful and advised me that making a police report and [sic] email to LTA so that they can investigate the case. … … … she called Auto lease asked them to release form B by this Tue 25/09/2018 if not LTA will let the buyer (Me) to transfer. Why LTA need 6 months to settle while San Hup Bee handovered the car for me 6 months ago without transferring ownership? And LTA didn’t take any action on this? Why Auto lease got the right to cancel the full settlement amount and stop release from B while I already paid them? Is there any Law in Singapore??? …. Kindly take this case as serious matter, and support for the ownership transfer happened.” (emphasis added) 106 In relying on the police report for his finding, the DJ stated:60Foot Note 60×Record of Appeal at p58 Para 93. 93 I should note that while the Police Incident Report made references to out of court statements by various third party LTA officers, the document was being relied on as evidence of the fact that the complaints were being made by the Plaintiff [3rd Respondent] to LTA and the police, and that certain responses were received from LTA and the police. The Police Incident Report was not adduced as truth of the contents therein – it was real evidence adduced to show that certain statements were exchanged between Plaintiff and LTA (irrespective of their truth). As such, it was not hearsay. Appellant’s case 107 The Appellant argued that the obligation to effect the transfer of the Vehicle lay with the Respondents: even if the Appellant had lodged Form B, the transfer would have fallen through if none of the Respondents submitted the requisite M01 form to LTA.61Foot Note 61×Appellant’s Case at Para 38.In this connection, the Appellant argued that the 3rd Respondent had no direct evidence of the steps taken to register the Vehicle, since it was his staff who had carried out the online transfer application62Foot Note 62×Appellant’s Case at Para 44; Transcript of 26 April 2021 at p 48 ln 18 to p 49 ln 10.. 108 As for the 3rd Respondent’s police report of 24 September 2018, in which the 3rd Respondent had described the complaints he made to LTA and the responses received from them, the Appellant argued that the DJ should not have relied on the contents of this report as evidence of the 3rd Respondent’s efforts to transfer the Vehicle63Foot Note 63×Appellant’s Case at Para 56-63; Transcript of 2 February 2023 at p 16 ln 29 to p 17 ln 9.. According to the Appellant, the contents of the report constituted inadmissible hearsay evidence because the exchanges between the 3rd Respondent and the LTA contained information about attempts allegedly made by the 3rd Respondent to transfer the Vehicle, when in fact it was the 3rd Respondent’s staff who made the purported attempts and informed him they were unsuccessful. Therefore, these were out-of-court statements from the 3rd Respondent’s staff, who were not called to testify about those exchanges. 3rd Respondent’s Case 109 The 3rd Respondent contended that the DJ did not rely on inadmissible hearsay evidence: in his grounds of decision, the DJ had explained that the police incident report was not adduced as truth of the contents therein, but was instead real evidence adduced to show that certain statements were exchanged between the 3rd Respondent and LTA.64Foot Note 64×3rd Respondent’s Case at p21-22 Para 64.The DJ had also explained that the 3rd Respondent’s failure to call its staff to testify about the unsuccessful online transfer was immaterial because there was other evidence to show reasonable attempts made by the 3rd Respondent to effect the transfer.65Foot Note 65×3rd Respondent’s Case at p21 Para 63. My Decision 110 By way of general principle, it is trite law that assertions which are made out of court, and which are tendered in court as evidence of the truth of the content therein will be inadmissible as hearsay (Soon Peck Wah vWoon Che Chye[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 (“Soon Peck Wah”) at [26];Chan Sze Ying v Management Corporation Strata Title Plan No 2948 (LeeChuen T’ng, intervener)[2021] 1 SLR 841 (“Chan Sze Ying”) at [95]). 111 It is also trite law that statements which are tendered not as evidence for the truth of their contents, but for the fact that they have been made are not hearsay evidence: seeZainal binKuning and others v Chan Sin Mian Michael and another[1996] 2 SLR(R) 858 (“Zainal binKuning”) at [35];CDL Hotels International Ltd v Pontiac Marina Pte Ltd[1998] 1 SLR(R) 975 (“CDL Hotels”) at [76];Saga Foodstuffs Manufacturing (Pte) Ltd v Best Food Pte Ltd[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1013 (“Saga Foodstuffs”) at [11];Subramaniam v PP[1956] 1 WLR 1 (“Subramaniam”). 112 As an illustration of how the above principles are applied, it may be useful to consider the case ofZainal binKuningas an example. InZainal binKuning, the appellants sued the respondents for false arrest and malicious prosecution. The respondents denied that there was any false arrest or that the prosecution had been initiated and conducted without reasonable and probable cause. The first respondent was the police officer in charge of the investigations against the appellants. He filed an affidavit in the proceedings in which he annexed copies of statements made to the police by one Abdul Hannan, a suspect whose statements had ledinter aliato the identification and arrest of one of the appellants. The appellants had applied at trial for Abdul Hannan’s statements to be expunged from the first respondent’s affidavit on the basis that they were hearsay and not admissible in evidence. Their application was rejected by the trial judge. On appeal, the CA held that the trial judge was right in not expunging the statements because these statements “were not tendered by the respondents as part of the first respondent’s evidence for the truth of their contents, but for the fact that they had been made to the first respondent and therefore in this respect they were not hearsay evidence” (at [35]). The “making of these statements formed the occasion or cause for the investigations and hence they are relevant under s 7 of the Evidence Act”. Alternatively, “as they show[ed] motive or preparation, they would be relevant under s 8 (of the Evidence Act)”. 113 As another example: inSubramaniam, the appellant was found in a wounded condition by security forces operating against terrorists. He was tried on a charge of being in unlawful possession of ammunition. His defence was that he had been captured by terrorists and that at all material times he was acting under duress. At trial he sought to give evidence of what the terrorists had said to him, but this evidence was disallowed by the trial judge on the basis that it formed inadmissible hearsay. On appeal, the Privy Council held that the trial judge was wrong to have ruled out evidence of statements made by the terrorists to the appellant. As the Privy Council explained (at p 970): It is hearsay and inadmissible when the object of the evidence is to establish the truth of what is contained in the statement. It is not hearsay and is admissible when it is proposed to establish by the evidence, not the truth of the statement, but the fact that it was made. The fact that the statements were made, quite apart from its truth, is frequently relevant in considering the mental state and conduct thereafter of the witness or of some other person in whose presence the statement was made. In the case before their Lordships statements would have been made to the appellant by the terrorists, which, whether true or not, if they had been believed by the appellant, might reasonably have induced in him an apprehension of instant death if h failed to conform to their wishes. 114 In considering parties’ submissions in the present case, there are several things that should be highlighted at the outset. First, the 3rd Respondent does not actually dispute that the police report should not be relied on as evidence of statements made by its staff about the failed transfer, and in particular, about the cause of the failed transfer. 115 Second, insofar as the fact that the 3rd Respondent’s attempt to register transfer of the vehicle was concerned, it is plain to me that even without the police report, it was not seriously disputed by anyone in the trial below that the attempted transfer had indeed failed. The dispute was over the cause of the failure. 116 In this connection, it is also plain to me that all the parties were agreed that the police report could not be relied on to prove that the LTA had told the 3rd Respondent the cause of his failed transfer was the Appellant’s non-lodgement of Form B. In his grounds of decision, the DJ was clear about this as well. 117 The question, then, is whether the DJ was entitled to rely on the police report as evidence that the 3rd Respondent had taken positive steps to do all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.66Foot Note 66×Record of Appeal at p50 Para 50.This brings me to my third point: even without considering the substantive contents of the police report, the report itself was undeniably evidence of the fact thatthe3rd Respondent had taken the step of escalating the matter to the police. This was thus one piece of evidence which went towards showing that he had taken positive actions to try to surmount the obstacles he was facing in procuring the transfer of the Vehicle. 118 The DJ also relied on the police report as evidence showing that the 3rd Respondent had “made repeated calls to LTA to seek assistance”. It is true that strictly speaking, if the police report was adduced as proof that the 3rd Respondent had made various calls to the LTA, it would be hearsay evidence. However, the fact that the 3rd Respondent was in court to give evidence made all the difference: in this context, the police report was not in my view relied on as hearsay evidence, but as corroboration – pursuant to s 159 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed) – of his testimony at trial that he did make numerous calls to LTA. For ease of reference, I set out below s 159: In order to corroborate the testimony of a witness, any former statement made by such witness, whether written or verbal, on oath, or in ordinary conversation, relating to the same fact at or about the time when the fact took place, or before any authority legally competent to investigate the fact, may be proved. 119 That a witness’ former statements may be proved at trial to corroborate the witness’ statements at trial on the same fact has been recognized in a number of local High Court decisions: seeeg,the judgment of Tan Lee Meng J inLimWeipin and another v Lim Boh Chuan and others[2010] 3 SLR 423 at [61] (although in that case, Tan J held that the disputed evidence did not qualify as a “former statement”, having been prepared by the witness and produced in his AEIC for the sole purpose of supporting his claim at trial). 120 Finally, the DJ relied on the police report as evidence showing that the 3rd Respondent had “sent lawyers’ letters” to the 1st and 2nd Respondents. Again, it is true that if the police report were adduced as proof that the 3rd Respondent had “sent lawyers’ letters” to the 1st and 2nd Respondents, it would be hearsay evidence. However, as I noted above, the 3rd Respondent was present to give his testimony at trial: I consider, therefore, that the statements in his police report about having “looked for the lawyer firm” and sent “summon letter to [the 1st and 2nd Respondents]” were simply corroboration of his testimony in court about having sought lawyers’ assistance to advance his claim for the transfer of the Vehicle. In other words, the DJ’s reliance on these statements did not amount to reliance on inadmissible hearsay evidence. 121 I add that in any event, it was common ground that by 28 August 2018, the 3rd Respondent had issued writ of summons against the 2nd Respondent: the Appellant’s Mr Lim himself acknowledged this fact in his AEIC.67Foot Note 67×Record of Appeal at p577-578 at Para 11.It is reasonable to infer that “lawyers’ letters” would have preceded or accompanied the issuance of such writ of summons. In other words, it was not even necessary for the DJ to rely on the police report as evidence corroborating the 3rd Respondent’s testimony about the steps taken through his lawyers to procure the transfer of the Vehicle. 122 For the reasons stated above, I am satisfied that the DJ did not rely on inadmissible hearsay evidence in finding that the 3rd Respondent had taken positive steps to procure the transfer of the Vehicle.",
        "Whether the DJ was correct to find that the 3rd Respondent had done all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle": "123 I am further satisfied that based on the evidence available, the DJ was justified in concluding that the 3rd Respondent had done all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle. 124 First, as a matter of logic and common sense, I agree that as the 3rd Respondent was in the business of leasing out cars and had made full payment for the Vehicle, it was rather improbable that he would have failed to take the requisite steps to effect registration of the transfer of ownership. 125 Second, the 3rd Respondent gave clear testimony about the steps he took to procure the transfer of the Vehicle after the failed attempt to register the transfer of ownership with the LTA. The 3rd Respondent testified that he called the LTA several times, went down to the LTA office three times to speak to different LTA officers, made a police report and took legal action through his lawyers. At one point, he even resorted to going to his Member of Parliament about the matter.68Foot Note 68×Transcript of 26 April 2021 at p 18 ln 32 to p 30 ln 28; p 59 ln 26 to p 61 ln 26; Transcript of 9 December 2021 at p 93 ln 26 to ln 28. 126 Third, as I noted earlier, the 3rd Respondent’s testimony about speaking to the LTA and taking legal action through his lawyers was corroborated by his previous statements in the police report of 24 September 2018. 127 Fourth, as the DJ pointed out,69Foot Note 69×Record of Appeal at p40 Para 51.the 2nd Respondent’s director Jaxon agreed in cross-examination that the 3rd Respondent “was always in contact with [him]”70Foot Note 70×Record of Appeal at p392 ln 10 to ln 15.regarding the subject of the transfer of the Vehicle. This supported the 3rd Respondent’s assertion that he was actively doing what he could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle. In my view, there was no reason for Jaxon to lie about this point, since his interests at trial were opposed to the 3rd Respondent’s interests.",
        "Whether the DJ was correct to find that the cause of the failed transfer was the continued existence of Form A in respect of the Vehicle on the HPFLAS system due to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to lodge a Form B": "128 Having found that the 3rd Respondent had done all he reasonably could to procure the transfer of the Vehicle, the DJ concluded that the 3rd Respondent was not at all to blame for the failed transfer; and that it was the 1st and 2nd Respondents who had breached the implied term of the Sales Agreement that they would procure the transfer of legal title to the 3rd Respondent, free of all encumbrances. In this connection, I note that in cross-examination at trial, the 2nd Respondent’s director Jaxon conceded that it was the seller’s (ie,the 2nd Respondent’s) obligation under the Sales Agreement to effect transfer of ownership within seven days of the said agreement, and that the seller in this case (ie,the 2nd Respondent) had not fulfilled its obligation.71Foot Note 71×Record of Appeal at p391 ln 15 to p 392 ln 1. 129 Further, the DJ found that the cause of the failed transfer was the continued existence of Form A in respect of the Vehicle on the HPFLAS system, which indicated that the Vehicle was under financing – and which resulted in turn from the Appellant’s wrongful refusal to lodge Form B after getting full payment for the Vehicle loan72Foot Note 72×Record of Appeal at p41 Para 54.. This finding formed the factual basis for the DJ’s determination in the third-party proceedings that the Appellant was liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for any sums payable by them to the 3rd Respondent. 130 I next address the Appellant’s submission that the DJ erred in finding the cause of the failed transfer to be the continued existence of Form A in the HPFLAS system. 131 I first summarise the DJ’s decision, as well as the submissions made by the Appellant, the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondent. Decision below 132 The DJ found that following the 3rd Respondent’s payment to the Appellant of the full amount outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement, the Appellant should have executed a Form B to discharge Form A, on the request of the 1st and 2nd Respondents. However, the Appellant deliberately chose not to do so.73Foot Note 73×Record of Appeal at p41 Para 56. 133 The DJ also rejected the Appellant’s argument that based on Clause 7 read with Annex B of the HPFLAS Code of Conduct (“COC”), non-lodgement of Form B would only have caused any transfer to be temporarily suspended for five days.74Foot Note 74×Record of Appeal at p42 Para 59.In the DJ’s view, clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS COC clearly provided that LTA retained sole and absolute discretion in deciding whether to accept or reject any transfer, notwithstanding the HPFLAS COC. The HPFLAS COC also did not impose any obligation on LTA to take any action.75Foot Note 75×Record of Appeal at p42-43 Paras 60-61. Appellant’s Case 134 On appeal, the Appellant claimed that based on the evidence adduced, the 1st and 2nd Respondents were the one who had failed to prove that the non-lodgement of Form B had caused the failure to transfer the title in the LTA system.76Foot Note 76×Appellant’s Case at Para 45.The Appellant gave the following three reasons for this proposition: (a) First, the Appellant reprised the argument that the HPFLAS COC only provided for a temporary five-day suspension of any transfer in the event of non-lodgement of Form B. According to the Appellant, the presence of Form A lodged on the HPFLAS would not prevent a vehicle from being transferred on LTA’s register.77Foot Note 77×Appellant’s Case at Para 47.In this connection, the Appellant claimed that the DJ had erred in his understanding of the HPFLAS COC and that the DJ had wrongly “conflated the working of the HPFLAS with the transfer of registered ownership under the LTA”.78Foot Note 78×Appellant’s Case at Para 38.The Appellant also argued that the DJ had erred in placing the evidential burden on the Appellant to show that the registration would have taken place even if Form A were not discharged; and that in any event, it had adduced sufficient evidence to satisfy any such evidential burden.79Foot Note 79×Appellant’s Case at Paras 40-41.(b) Second, the Appellant claimed that the DJ had wrongly ignored the 3rd Respondent’s own AEIC evidence that when the online transfer application was filed, an “Electronic Service Agent” had advised that the Vehicle could be transferred after five (5) days.80Foot Note 80×Appellant’s Case at Para 48.According to the Appellant, an “Electronic Service Agent” would have “access to the HPFLAS system” and “would have known of the existence of the Form A” when giving such advice.81Foot Note 81×Appellant’s Case at Para 49.(c) Third, the Appellant sought to rely on the contents of the 3rd Respondent’s police report of 24 September 2018: specifically, his statement in the police report that LTA officials had told him they would call the Appellant to “lodge the Form B”, failing which they would let the 3rd Respondent effect the transfer.82Foot Note 82×Appellant’s Case at Para 50; Record of Appeal at p37-38 Para 46.. 2nd Respondent’s Case 135 The 2nd Respondent submitted that the DJ had rightly found the Appellant responsible for the unsuccessful transfer of ownership of the Vehicle, because the Appellant’s failure to execute Form B led to Form A remaining in the system and the Vehicle being shown as “under financing”.83Foot Note 83×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 12.The 2nd Respondent pointed to testimony given by the Appellant’s Mr Lim under cross-examination at trial.Inter alia,Mr Lim had conceded in cross-examination that where Form A had been lodged against a vehicle, in the event of a sale of the vehicle, the transfer of title to the next owner would be stopped.84Foot Note 84×Record of Appeal at p452 ln 25 to p453 ln 14.Mr Lim had also conceded that not releasing Form B could prevent the transfer of ownership under the LTA system.85Foot Note 85×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 18; Record of Appeal at p480 ln 3 to ln 19.Further, contrary to Mr Lim’s assertion in his AEIC that the Appellant had receive no notice from HPFLAS about a transfer of the Vehicle, in cross-examination Mr Lim had admitted that the Appellant was in fact so informed by HPFLAS.86Foot Note 86×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 23; ROA at p582 Para 44 and p454 ln 15 to ln 29 and p488 ln 5 to p489 ln 4. 136 The 2nd Respondent also submitted that the DJ was correct in finding that under Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS COC, LTA retained the sole and absolute discretion as to whether to accept or reject any transfer, and that nothing in the HPFLAS COC imposed any obligation on LTA to accept or reject any transfer.87Foot Note 87×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 21. 3rd Respondent’s Case 137 In similar vein, the 3rd Respondent submitted that the Appellant’s Mr Lim had conceded in cross-examination that the 3rd Respondent would not be able to obtain a transfer of the Vehicle if Form B were not lodged;88Foot Note 88×3rd Respondent’s Case at p26-27 Para 75.and that the Appellant was in fact informed by HPFLAS of an attempt to transfer the Vehicle.89Foot Note 89×3rd Respondent’s Case at p28 Para 76.Mr Lim had further admitted in cross-examination that the LTA retained the sole and absolute discretion to decide whether to accept or reject a transfer, and that nothing in the HPFLAS COC imposed any obligation on the LTA.90Foot Note 90×3rd Respondent’s Case at p31 Para 87.As such, the HPFLAS did not guarantee that the transfer of the Vehicle could take place within five days of a sale, in a situation where Form A was still in place.91Foot Note 91×3rd Respondent’s Case at p31 Para 88. My Decision 138 In considering parties’ submissions, it must first be highlighted that in the trial below, none of the parties called any witnesses from either HPFLAS or the LTA to testify as to how vehicle transfers actually worked on the ground. In the circumstances, the DJ was obliged to draw certain inferences and conclusions from the evidence available before him. 139 Second, it must also be highlighted that the Appellant was the only party in these proceedings who was a member of the HPFLAS. The Respondents are not (and have never been) HPFLAS members. As such, the Appellant’s Mr Lim was really the only witness with personal experience of how the whole system of vehicle transfers worked on the ground. 140 Third, the Appellant’s argument that the HPFLAS COC only provided for atemporaryfive-day suspension of any transfer in the event of non-lodgement of Form B – and that the transfer of the Vehicle should have gone through in the LTA system once the Respondents filed the appropriate form – assumed that a successful transfer was virtually guaranteed within five days. This argument – and the assumption on which it was premised – flew in the face of the plain language of Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS COC. For ease of reference, I reproduce Clause 7.5 below:92Foot Note 92×Record of Appeal at p897. 7.5 Each Member acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding any other provision in this Code of Conduct and Regulations or the Memorandum, the LTA retains the sole and absolute discretion to decide whether to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction and that nothing in this Code of Conduct and Regulations or the Memorandum is intended to, and shall not, whether under contract, tort or any other theory or law: (a) impose any obligation on the LTA to accept or reject any VRLS Transaction or otherwise impose any fetter or duty of care on the LTA in relation to the exercise of any of its powers under the Road Traffic Act (Cap. 276) (the “RTA”) or any other law… 141   It is not disputed that the LTA is not a member of the HPFLAS and not a party to its COC. As the DJ has rightly pointed out,93Foot Note 93×Record of Appeal at p42-43 Paras 60-61.Clause 7.5 of the HPFLAS COC expressly acknowledges that the COC does not impose any obligation on the LTA to accept or reject any transfer, nor does it in any way fetter the LTA in the exercise of any of its powers under the Road Traffic Act. It is clearly beyond doubt, therefore, that regardless of whatever the HPFLAS may say, the LTA retains sole and absolute discretion to decide whether to accept or reject any transfer. In other words, without a Form B being lodged, the LTA might still reject a transfer of ownership even after the expiration of the five-day suspension period provided by the HPFLAS COC. There is no basis, therefore, for the Appellant to claim that the Vehicle in this case could and would have been successfully transferred to the 3rd Respondent after only a “temporary” five-day suspension. 142 Fourth, Mr Lim himself conceded in cross-examination that notwithstanding the HPFLAS COC, if he did not lodge a Form B, the HPFLAS system would still indicate that the Vehicle was under financing;94Foot Note 94×Record of Appeal at p473 ln 18 to ln 29.and if he did not tell the LTA that the financing issues had been settled, then the LTA might not approve the transfer.95Foot Note 95×Record of Appeal at p480 ln 3 to p481 ln 26.Indeed, Mr Lim accepted in cross-examination that if Form A was discharged via the lodgement of a Form B, then there would be no issues with the transfer of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent.96Foot Note 96×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 22; Record of Appeal at p520 ln 13 to ln 16..Mr Lim also conceded that the Appellant should have released the Form B for the Vehicle after obtaining full payment of the outstanding sum under the Hire Purchase Agreement – and that he had not done so in order to place the 1st and 2nd Respondents in a difficult position.97Foot Note 97×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 30; Record of Appeal at p506 ln 28 to p507 ln 9.. 143 In this connection, I should add that given the LTA’s clear discretion to decide whether to accept any transfer, the Appellant’s insistence that Mr Lim’s testimony should be disregarded in the court’s determination as to the actual workings of the vehicle transfer system was wholly self-serving and devoid of merit. Since the LTA clearly retained the sole discretion as to whether to approve a transfer, it was relevant for the DJ to consider evidence of the LTA’s actual practice in a situation where a vehicle was shown to be still under financing. In the absence of any witnesses from the LTA or HPFLAS, and given Mr Lim’s experience as the Appellant’s director, the DJ was plainly justified in taking into consideration Mr Lim’s evidence. 144 Fifth, I also reject the Appellant’s submission that the DJ wrongly placed the evidential burden on the Appellant to show that registration would have taken place even if Form A were not discharged. By the close of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ case below, having heard evidence from all three Respondents, the DJ had before him evidence, firstly, that the outstanding hire-purchase loan on the Vehicle had been fully paid off (a fact acknowledged by the Appellant itself in its official receipt);98Foot Note 98×Record of Appeal at p 708-709.secondly, that the 1st and 2nd Respondents had given the 3rd Respondent the relevant M01 application form and transaction PIN necessary for effecting the transfer of ownership in the LTA records; thirdly, that the 3rd Respondent’s attempt to effect the transfer had nevertheless failed; fourthly, that the 3rd Respondent had taken all the steps he reasonably could to effect the transfer; fifthly, that no Form B had been lodged in the HPFLAS system by the Appellant to lift its “charge” over the Vehicle despite the hire-purchase loan having been paid off. In light of this evidence, and in the absence of evidence from witnesses from LTA and HPFLAS, I find the DJ was justified in inferring at the close of the 1st and 2nd Respondents’ case that there was some (not inherently incredible) evidence that the Appellant’s refusal to lodge the Form B had caused the failed transfer. The evidential burden then shifted to the Appellant to adduce some evidence to show that notwithstanding the non-lodgement of the Form B with HPFLAS, the transfer of the vehicle would still have been accepted by the LTA after a temporary five-day suspension –perthe provisions of the HPFLAS COC. I understand this to be what the DJ meant when he said (at [62] of his grounds of decision): Given the Third Party [the Appellant] was relying on the HPFLAS Code in support of its defence that the transfer would have gone through notwithstanding the failure to lodge a Form B, the burden was on the Third Party to call the relevant operators of the systems to substantiate this fact.  This the Third Party failed to do. 145 I do not see anything wrong with the DJ’s reasoning. This is indeed how the shifting of the evidential burden works in the course of a trial: see the CA’s judgment in this respect inBritestonePte Ltd v Smith & Associates Far East, Ltd[2007] 4 SLR(R) 85599Foot Note 99×1PBOA Tab 8.(“Britestone”) at [58]-[60]. As it turned out, not only did the Appellant fail to call any witness from the LTA and/or HPFLAS, its director Mr Lim made several material concessions during cross-examination which supported the Respondents’ assertion about the non-lodgement of Form B being the cause of the failed transfer. 146 Sixth, although the Appellant has sought to rely on the statement in the 3rd Respondent’s AEIC that he had been “advised by an Electronic Service Agent” that the vehicle “could be transferred after five (5) days”,100Foot Note 100×Record of Appeal at p697 Para 14.I did not find this statement to be in any way helpful to the Appellant’s case. To begin with, as the Appellant itself was at pains to point out, the 3rd Respondent had clarified in cross-examination that it was his staff – and not him – who had done the online transfer application; and he had no idea what an “Electronic Service Agent” was. No evidence was adduced by any party as to what an “Electronic Service Agent” was and/or how it functioned. There was no basis, therefore, for thinking that any response given by an “Electronic Service Agent” to an online transfer application constituted some sort of official promise or guarantee from the LTA. Indisputably, as it turned out, whatever might have been indicated by the so-called “Electronic Service Agent” at the time the 3rd Respondent’s transfer application was filed, that transfer application did not succeed in effecting transfer of ownership of the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent. 147 Finally, the Appellant also sought to rely on the 3rd Respondent’s statement in his police report about LTA officers having told him that they would call the Appellant to lodge the Form B, failing which they would let the 3rd Respondent transfer.101Foot Note 101×Appellant’s Case at Para 50; Record of Appeal at p711.However, this attempt to rely on the contents of the 3rd Respondent’s police report was misconceived. As the Appellant itself has pointed out in its own submissions, the rule against hearsay evidence precludes the contents of the police report being used as evidence of the truth thereof. 148 For the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the DJ rightly decided on a balance of probabilities that the cause of the transfer issues was the continued existence of Form A in respect of the Vehicle, owing to the Appellant’s wrongful failure to execute a Form B.",
        "Issue 5: Whether the DJ awarded the correct quantum of damages of $2,200 a month to the 3rd Respondent": "149 I next address the Appellant’s submission that the DJ erred in assessing the damages due to the 3rd Respondent at the sum of $2,200 per month. 150 I first summarise below the DJ’s decision as well as the Appellant’s and the 3rd Respondent’s submissions.",
        "Decision below": "217 The DJ found the Appellant liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for all damages and costs payable to the 3rd Respondent on the basis that the Appellant had acted in breach of the Hire-Purchase Agreement.  The breach was committed by the Appellant appropriating $13,301 from the $49,200.86 paid by the 3rd Respondent towards settlement of the hire-purchase loan and using the amount thus appropriated to pay off debts owed to it by SHB Motoring. The DJ pointed out that the set-off clause under the Hire Purchase Agreement (Clause 20) only permitted set-offs involving the same hirer,iethe 1st Respondent.154Foot Note 154×Record of Appeal at p54 Para 85.As such, there was no basis for the Appellant to set off the $13,301 against any amounts owed by SHB Motoring, which was an entirely separate entity and whose debts to the Appellant arose from an entirely separate contract. 218 The DJ also observed that the Appellant’s director Mr Lim had conceded at trial that the 1st Respondent and SHB Motoring were not identical nor related entities, and that there was no basis to appropriate monies paid under the Hire-Purchase Agreement with the 1st Respondent in order to pay off SHB Motoring’s debts. In exercising a right of set-off without any basis and failing to lodge a Form B despite having received full payment of the hire-purchase loan, the Appellant had caused the 1st and 2nd Respondents to be unable to effect transfer of full title in the Vehicle to the 3rd Respondent – resulting in the 1st and 2nd Respondents breaching the Sales Agreement with the 3rd Respondent. The Appellant must therefore indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for all sums payable by them to the 3rd Respondent.155Foot Note 155×Record of Appeal at p55-56 Para 86.",
        "Issue 6: Whether the DJ properly assessed the 3rd Respondent’s duty to mitigate": "164 I next address the Appellant’s submission that the DJ erred in his assessment of the 3rd Respondent’s duty to mitigate. I start by summarising below the DJ’s decision as well as the Appellant’s and the 3rd Respondent’s arguments.",
        "Issue 7: Whether the Appellant should be liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the damages suffered and costs incurred": "216 Finally, I address the Appellant’s submission that it should not be held liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the damages and costs payable to the 3rd Respondent. I first summarise below the DJ’s decision as well as the argument advanced by the Appellant, the 2nd Respondent and the 3rd Respondent.",
        "2nd Respondent’s Case": "220 The 2nd Respondent essentially agreed with the DJ’s reasoning. The 2nd Respondent contended that there was no contractual basis for the Appellant to set off the sum of $13,301 against any debts owed by SHB Motoring, as the set-off clause under the Hire Purchase Agreement only permitted set-offs involving the same hirer.157Foot Note 157×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 27.The DJ had rightly found the amount outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement to be discharged upon the 3rd Respondent’s payment of $49,200.86 to the Appellant;158Foot Note 158×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 26.and Mr Lim himself confirmed at trial that all outstanding loans on the Vehicle had been paid off.159Foot Note 159×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 28; Record of Appeal at p502 ln 4 to ln 23.The Appellant thus had no valid basis for withholding the execution of the Form B.160Foot Note 160×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 29.Indeed, Mr Lim had conceded that the Appellant acted as it did in order to place the 1st and 2nd Respondents in a difficult position.161Foot Note 161×2nd Respondent’s Case at Para 30; Record of Appeal at p506 ln 31 to p507 ln 9.",
        "My views": "222 I find the Appellant’s arguments in respect of Issue 7 to be entirely without merit. My reasons are as follows. 223 First, the Appellant’s argument that monies were outstanding from the 1st and 2nd Respondents to the Appellant is specious. Insofar as the Hire Purchase Agreement was concerned, following the 3rd Respondent’s payment of the sum of $49,200.86, the Appellant itself had confirmed full settlement of the hire-purchase loan for the Vehicle by issuing an official receipt dated 15 March 2018.164Foot Note 164×Record of Appeal at p696, p708-709.As the 2nd Respondent has pointed out, the Appellant’s director Mr Lim also conceded at trial that all outstanding loans on the Vehicle had been paid off.165Foot Note 165×Record of Appeal at p502 ln 4 to ln 23.The only reason Mr Lim had for subsequently claiming that the hire-purchase loan had not been fully paid was his own action in appropriating a sum of $13,301 from the 3rd Respondent’s payment and using this sum to partially set off debts from SHB Motoring. He had no right to do this. At trial, he admitted in cross-examination that he acted as he did in order to put the 1st and 2nd Respondents in a difficult position.166Foot Note 166×Record of Appeal at p506 ln 31 to p507 ln 9.The SHB Motoring debt was a debt owing from a separate entity under a separate contract: the set-off clause in the Hire Purchase Agreement did not permit the Appellant to set off any part of the $49,200.86 payment against debts owing from entities other than the 1st Respondent. 224 Second, the Appellant has also sought to rely on the DJ’s suggestion that as a mitigation strategy, the 3rd Respondent should have paid the outstanding debt of $13,301 to the Appellant and claimed this amount in turn from the 1st and 2nd Respondents. The Appellant argued that this suggestion somehow gave it a legitimate basis for holding back the filing of a Form B so long as the $13,301 was not paid. I have explained earlier (at [174]-[180] above) why I rejected the DJ’s suggestion about the mitigation strategies which the 3rd Respondent should have adopted. There is therefore no basis for the Appellant to claim that the DJ’s suggestion provided some sort of basis for its refusal to file a Form B after being paid the outstanding hire-purchase loan amount. 225 I add that it is wrong for the Appellant to say that the DJ did not find its claim of a debt owed by the 1st and 2nd Respondents to be frivolous.  Such an argument ignores the DJ’s clear findings that the Appellant had received full payment under the Hire Purchase Agreement167Foot Note 167×Record of Appeal at p55 Para 86.and that it had no basis for setting off part of this payment against SHB Motoring’s debt.168Foot Note 168×Record of Appeal at p54-55 Para 85. 226 Ultimately, as between the Appellant and the 1st and 2nd Respondents, the issue in contention in the third-party proceedings was whether the 1st and 2nd Respondents had any basis for claiming from the Appellant all sums payable by them to the 3rd Respondent. To reiterate: at trial, it was firmly established that the Appellant had received the sum of $49,200.86 outstanding under the Hire Purchase Agreement; that it had no right under the said agreement to appropriate any part of that payment towards setting off SHB Motoring’s debt; and that having received the sum of $49,200.86, it had no legitimate reason to refuse to file the Form B that would have released its charge over the Vehicle. Given these facts, the Appellant – as the “Owner” under the Hire Purchase Agreement – was clearly in breach of its contractual obligation to the 1st Respondent (the “Hirer”) to “assign and make over” to the Hirer all its “right title and interest” in the Vehicle once full payment had been made of the hire-purchase loan (Clause 13 of the Hire Purchase Agreement).169Foot Note 169×Record of Appeal at p 878.The damage resulting from the Appellant’s breach clearly included the judgment sum and costs which the 1st and 2nd Respondents were ordered to pay the 3rd Respondent for their failure to transfer to it full title in the Vehicle free from any encumbrance under the Sales Agreement. The Appellant’s conduct in this case was thus analogous to the acts of the third parties inEastern Shipping Company, Limited v Quah Beng Kee[1924] AC 177 (“Eastern Shipping”) andHygeianMedical Supplies Pte Ltd v Tri-Star Rotary Screen Engraving Works Pte Ltd[1993] 2 SLR(R) 411 (“Hygeian”), where “the third party’s acts were the primary – indeed, theonly– cause of the respective defendants’ liability to the respective plaintiff” (seeTanJuay Pahat [45]). 227 For completeness, I do not think the exclusion clause in clause 5(1) of the Hire Purchase Agreement is relevant to the issue in contention in the third-party proceedings (ie,whether there was any basis for the 1st and 2nd Respondents to claim from the Appellant the sums payable by them to the 3rd Respondent). For ease of reference, I reproduce clause 5(1) below:170Foot Note 170×Record of Appeal at p 877. 5.   (1)The Hirer hereby agree and declares that under no circumstances whatsoever are the Owners to be held responsible for any delay or non-delivery o [sic] said Goods; and any liability the Owners might otherwise incur and any right or immunity the Hirer might otherwise possess in respect of any conditions warranti [sic] representations relating to the condition of the said Goods (whether the same are new or second hand) or its correspondence with description or sample or its merchantable quality of fitness for the particular purpose or any purpose for which it is or may be required whether express or implied and whether arising under this Agreement or under any prior agreement or in oral or written statements made by or on behalf of any person in the course of negotiations in which the Hirer or its representative may have been concerned prior to this Agreement are hereby excluded; and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing no liability shall attach to the Owners either in contract or in tort for loss injury or damage sustained by reason of any defect in the said Goods whether such defect be latent or apparent on examination and the Owners shall not be liable to indemnify the Hirer in respect of any claim made against the Hirer by a third party for any such injury or damage … 228 It is plain to me that clause 5(1) is intended to exclude any liability on the Owner’s (Appellant’s) part for any defects in the quality and fitness for purpose of the goods being sold (including any latent defects). Clause 5(1) has nothing to do with the Owner’s (Appellant’s) obligation under clause 13 to assign and make over to the Hirer (1st Respondent) all its rights, title and interest in the Vehicle when full payment is made of the Hire Purchase loan, and cannot excuse the Owner’s (Appellant’s) breach of this obligation. This is in line with the trite principle that exemption clauses are to be construed strictly and any exemption must be done in clear words (Singapore Telecommunications Ltd v Starhub Cable Vision Ltd[2006] 2 SLR(R) 195 at [52];Kay Lim Construction & Trading Pte Ltd v Soon Douglas (Pte) Ltd and another[2013] 1 SLR 1 (“Kay Lim”) at [40];HSBC Institutional Trust Services (Singapore) Ltd (as trustee of AIMS AMP Capital Industrial REIT) v DNKH Logistics Pte Ltd[2022] SGHC 248 at [28]). 229 In any event, the Appellant has not sought to rely on clause 5(1) either in the trial below or on appeal.",
        "Conclusion": "230 In conclusion, for the reasons explained, I dismiss the Appellant’s appeal in entirety. I also order that the quantum of damages awarded to the 3rd Respondent be revised to $49,867. For the avoidance of doubt, interest is to be computed based on this revised quantum; and the Appellant remains liable to indemnify the 1st and 2nd Respondents for the revised judgment sum and interest (as well as the costs and disbursements below) payable by them to the 3rd Respondent. 231 As the Appellant has failed on all the issues it raised in the appeal, costs should follow the event:ie,the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Respondents should be paid the costs of the appeal by the Appellant.  232 I will hear parties on the quantum of costs. Mavis Chionh Sze ChyiJudge of the High Court Vijai Dharamdas Parwani and Huang Po Han (Parwani Law LLC) for the Appellant; Lee Koon Foong Adam Hariz and Shannon Lim Qi (Joseph Tan Jude Benny LLP) for the 1st and 2nd Respondents; Tan Li Yi Caleb, Ang Stanley and Siow Yi Dong David (JusEquity Law Corporation) for the 3rd Respondent.",
