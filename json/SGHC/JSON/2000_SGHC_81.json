        "Facts": "1. The Plaintiffs are a bank incorporated in the Netherlands with a\n\nbranch office in Singapore.. The 1stDefendants are a private limited company\n\nincorporated in Singapore, having as its only two directors the 2ndand the 3rdDefendants who, at the material time, were husband and wife. The 1stDefendants\n\nobtained banking facilities from the Plaintiffs and were sued as principal debtor whilst\n\nthe claim against the 2ndand 3rdDefendants was in their capacity\n\nas sureties.2. On 11 February 2000, the Plaintiffs obtained summary judgment\n\nagainst all three defendants pursuant to Order 14 Rule 3 of the Rules of Court. This is\n\nthe appeal brought by the 3rdDefendant only against the summary judgment\n\ngranted by the learned Senior Assistant Registrar.3. The Plaintiff granted banking facilities to the 1stDefendant by way of letters of offer. In the Statement of Claim they pleaded specifically,\n\na letter dated 27 January 1997 whereby short-term multi-currency facilities up to\n\nUS$2,500,000.00 were offered. This letter in effect increased an earlier facility granted\n\nin October 1996 by US$500,000.00. It was a term of the offer that the facilities would be\n\nsecuredinter aliaby the joint and several continuing personal guarantees of the 2ndand the 3rdDefendants. The other material terms were as follows:(1) the Plaintiffs shall be entitled to charge interest and commission\n\n  on the facilities at such rates as particularized in the letter of offer, and in\n\n  particular the interest chargeable on the overdraft facility shall be the rate of 2.5%\n\n  above the Plaintiffs’ cost of funds,(2) all legal and out of pocket expenses incurred by the Plaintiffs in\n\n  connection with the enforcement of their rights under the letter of offer and under any\n\n  security document shall be payable by the Borrower (i.e. the 1stDefendants),\n\n  and(3) save as amended, revised or superseded by the letter of offer of 27\n\n  January 1997, the Plaintiffs’ earlier letters to the 1stDefendants for\n\n  credit facilities shall continue to apply.4. In their claim against the sureties, the Plaintiffs relied on a Deed\n\nof Guarantee dated 16 October 1996 signed by the 2ndand 3rdDefendants which provided that,‘In consideration of the [the Plaintiffs] .. extending or\n\n  continuing to extend loans, advances, accommodation, credit or other financial facilities\n\n  of any kind whatever from time to time .. to [the 1stDefendant] … we [the\n\n  2ndand 3rdDefendants] HEREBY JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY GUARANTEE on\n\n  demand in writing being made to us to pay and satisfy to the [Plaintiffs] all sums of\n\n  money which are now or shall at any time be owing to the [Plaintiffs] anywhere on any\n\n  account whatsoever ..and further,‘This guarantee shall be binding as a continuing guarantee on us,\n\n  our executors, administrators and legal representatives until the expiration of three(3)\n\n  calendar months after the Bank shall have received notice in writing given by us … to\n\n  discontinue or determine this guarantee…. ‘5. In April 1999, the Plaintiffs advised the 1stDefendants\n\nthat the sums of Japanese Yen 314,399,788 together with interest of Japanese Yen 157,200,\n\nand US$822.18 together with interest of US$1.03 were due and owing. The 1stDefendants failed to make payment. As at 5 July 1999, the sum had increased to Japanese\n\nYen 316,790,007, US$1,262.22 (‘the principal sums’) and interest of Japanese Yen\n\n131,635 as well as US$1.37. These were the sums claimed in the Writ together with further\n\ninterest which continued to accrue.6. In their Defence, the 1stDefendants admitted owing the\n\nPlaintiffs the principal sums claimed but denied that the Plaintiffs were entitled to the\n\ninterest portions. Judgment was entered on 16 September 1999 pursuant to Order 27 Rule 3\n\nof the Rules of Court against the 1stDefendants for the principal sums. The 1stDefendants made some payments to account in August and October 1999 which were used by the\n\nPlaintiffs to set off against the interest accrued on both the Japanese Yen and US$\n\naccounts. As at 1 November 1999, the Plaintiffs certified the amount due and owing by the\n\n1stDefendants to be Japanese Yen 318,951,638 comprising the principal of\n\nJapanese Yen 318,925,061 and interest of Japanese Yen 26,577).7. The Plaintiffs sought in their application for summary judgment the\n\nfollowing:(a) against the 1stDefendant, the sum of Japanese Yen\n\n  2,161,631 less US$1,262.22 (equivalent to the amount owing as at 1 November 1999 less the\n\n  judgment sum of Japanese Yen 316,790,007 and US$1,262.22),(b) against the 2ndand 3rdDefendants, the sum\n\n  of Japanese Yen 318,951,638,(c) against all three defendants, further interest at the rate of 2.5%\n\n  above the Plaintiff’s cost of funds, and(d) costs on an indemnity basis.",
        "The Defences raised in the affidavits": "8. Although this appeal is by the 3rdDefendant only, I will\n\nmention briefly the defences raised by the 2ndDefendant as the 1stDefendants did not file any affidavit to oppose the application for summary judgment. The\n\n2ndDefendant filed two affidavits, the first purportedly on behalf of himself\n\nand the 3rdDefendant and the second on his own behalf. After the 2ndDefendant’s affidavit was filed, the 3rdDefendant instructed separate\n\nsolicitors and sought leave to file her own affidavits to oppose the summary judgment\n\napplication.9. In essence, the 2ndDefendant contended that he should be\n\nentitled to defend the action on the basis that the 27 January 1997 letter of offer\n\nrequired a fresh guarantee to be executed by both the directors. The guarantee signed on\n\n16 October 1996 was for the purpose of securing facilities under a letter of offer dated 3\n\nOctober 1996 which was subsequently not utilized by the parties. The guarantee signed on\n\n16 October 1996 was therefore not applicable to the facilities offered in the 27 January\n\n1997 letter. These submissions were rejected by the learned Senior Assistant Registrar,\n\nand rightly so, as the guarantee was a continuing guarantee which would extend to all\n\nfuture loans and facilities.10. The Plaintiffs had explained in their affidavit that the letters of\n\noffer dated 3 October 1996 and 27 January 1997 were not the first two letters of offer\n\nmade to the First Defendants. The first such letter was in October 1989 and a continuing\n\nguarantee was executed by the 2ndand the 3rdDefendants that same\n\nmonth. The credit facilities were subsequently revised on numerous occasions without the\n\nneed for a separate guarantee. The balance drawn on the existing credit facilities was\n\ncarried forward to the new facilities upon acceptance of each letter of offer. Therefore,\n\nalthough no drawdown was made after the execution of the 1996 letter of offer, the\n\nfacilities had been activated. The 2ndand the 3rdDefendants were\n\nnot required to execute a fresh guarantee for each revised letter of offer because the\n\n1989 and the 1996 guarantees were continuing ones. The only reason the 1996 guarantee was\n\nrequired was that new terms were inserted therein in response to jurisdictional issues and\n\nthe effect of the Indonesian Civil Code. All other terms in the two guarantees remained\n\nthe same.11. The 3rdDefendant deposed to the following after leave\n\nwas granted for her to file her affidavits:(1) She was estranged from her husband and had entered into a Deed of\n\n  Separation in August 1996. She was also suffering from asthma and herpes. She had decided\n\n  to relocate to the United States and was organizing her move there after returning from\n\n  visiting friends and relatives on or about 27 September 1996.(2) The 2ndDefendant who was then in Singapore requested\n\n  her to sign the guarantee to the Plaintiffs for facilities up to US$2million. She refused\n\n  as they had already entered into the Deed of Separation. The previous guarantee that she\n\n  had signed was for facilities secured by a property owned by the 2ndDefendant.(3) The 2ndDefendant then subjected her to harassment both\n\n  in and out of the home and the office. She was also the victim of his abusive behaviour,\n\n  his vulgarities and his threats of violence.(4) She was fearful that the 2ndDefendant would create\n\n  problems for her in regard to the removal of items in the matrimonial home to the United\n\n  States, that he would renege on his agreement to maintain their children and that he would\n\n  oppose her divorce petition.(5) She therefore succumbed to his demand to sign the guarantee under\n\n  pressure of these difficult circumstances.(6) When she signed the guarantee in the premises of the 1stDefendants, there was no witness present. She was not advised on the terms of the\n\n  guarantee nor the circumstances requiring it.(7) She also queried the propriety of the transactions in the account\n\n  and the utilization of the facilities which were not for the benefit of the 1stDefendants but credited to the 2ndDefendant’s personal account.12. The 2ndDefendant denied the 3rdDefendant’s allegations of undue influence or duress on his part. On the use of the\n\nfunds, he further stated that he had kept the 3rdDefendant generally informed\n\nof the affairs of the company. He also pointed out that the 3rdDefendant had\n\nbeen involved in the affairs of the company as she had contacted the Plaintiffs to discuss\n\nthe indebtedness of the company and to ask for time for the 2ndDefendant to\n\nsettle the outstanding amounts.13. In response to the 3rdDefendant’s allegations, the\n\nPlaintiffs filed the affidavit of one Diana Tee Gek Cher who had attended at the premises\n\nof the 1stDefendants to witness the signatures of their directors although she\n\nsaid she had forgotten to append her own signature on the document as witness. I should\n\nadd here that the guarantee document exhibited to the Plaintiffs’ 1staffidavit did not show any witness’ signature. The Plaintiffs also filed a further\n\naffidavit exhibiting searches at the Registry of Companies showing that the 3rdDefendant herself had experience in business being a director and major shareholder of\n\nanother company, Noahtu Trading Pte Ltd since 1992.",
        "The issues": "14. The main contention of the 3rdDefendant was that she\n\nhad been subject to the undue influence of the 2ndDefendant, her then husband,\n\nin signing the guarantee. Relying on the authority ofBarclays Bank plc v\n\nO’Brien[1993] 4 All E R 417, her counsel contended that the\n\nPlaintiffs as bankers ought to have known of this undue influence and taken steps to\n\nadvise her that she should seek independent legal advice. The other argument raised by the\n\n3rdDefendant was that the irregularities in the account called for further\n\ninquiry and hence, summary judgment was not appropriate.15. The issues I had to consider in this appeal were therefore:(1) In signing the guarantee, was the 3rdDefendant subject\n\n  to the undue influence of the 2ndDefendant?(2) Should the Plaintiffs as bankers be fixed with constructive notice\n\n  of the alleged undue influence on the 3rdDefendant?(3) Did the Plaintiffs’ failure to inform the 3rdDefendant that she should take independent legal advice prior to signing the guarantee\n\n  entitle her to set aside the guarantee?(4) Was the absence of the signature of the witness on the Deed of\n\n  Guarantee sufficient to raise a defence to the Plaintiffs’ claim?(5) Were there irregularities in the use of the funds such that further\n\n  inquiry was warranted?16. As this is an appeal from a summary judgment application, the\n\nburden is on the 3rdDefendant to satisfy the Court that there is an issue or\n\nquestion in dispute which ought to be tried or that there ought for some other reason be a\n\ntrial.",
        "The law on undue influence": "17. The facts inBarclay’s Bank plc v O’Brienas\n\nsummarized in the headnotes of the report are as follows:\"The husband, a shareholder in a\n\n  manufacturing company, which had a substantial unsecured overdraft, arranged with the\n\n  manager of the company’s bank that the company would be allowed an overdraft facility\n\n  of 135,000, reducing to 120,000 after 3 weeks, and that as security the husband would\n\n  guarantee the company’s indebtedness, his liability in turn being secured by a second\n\n  charge over the matrimonial home jointly owned by the husband and the wife. The bank\n\n  prepared the necessary security documents, which included the guarantee to be signed by\n\n  the husband and a legal charge over the house to be signed by both the husband and the\n\n  wife. However, although the manager gave instructions that the husband and wife should be\n\n  made fully aware of the nature and effect of the documents they were signing and should\n\n  take independent legal advice if they were in any doubt, those instructions were not\n\n  followed by the bank staff responsible for arranging for the husband and wife to sign the\n\n  documents. The husband signed the documents without reading them and the next day took his\n\n  wife to the bank, where she also signed the documents without reading them. The\n\n  company’s indebtedness increased beyond the agreed limit and the bank brought\n\n  possession proceedings against the husband and the wife to enforce payment under the\n\n  guarantee.By her defence, the wife contended (i) that her husband had put undue\n\n  pressure on her to sign and that she had succumbed to that pressure, and (ii) that her\n\n  husband had misrepresented to her the effect of the legal charge and that although she\n\n  knew she was signing a mortgage of the matrimonial home she believed that the security was\n\n  limited to 60,000 and would only last three weeks.The judge gave judgment for the bank, holding that the husband’s\n\n  liability under the guarantee had been established, that the husband had not unduly\n\n  influenced the wife and that although he had falsely represented to her the effect of the\n\n  charge the bank was not responsible for the husband’s misrepresentation.The wife appealed to the Court of Appeal, which held that married women\n\n  who provided security for their husband’s debts were to be treated as a specially\n\n  protected class of sureties, that, if in such a situation the relationship between the\n\n  debtor and the surety and the consequent likelihood of influence and reliance was known to\n\n  the creditor, the creditor was under a duty to take reasonable steps to try and ensure\n\n  that the surety entered into the transaction with an adequate understanding of the nature\n\n  and effect of the transaction and the surety’s consent to the transaction was true\n\n  and informed consent, and that the creditor would not be permitted to enforce the security\n\n  if, by leaving it to the debtor to deal with the surety or otherwise, he failed to carry\n\n  out that duty even though he might have had no knowledge of and could not have been\n\n  responsible for the vitiating feature of the transaction.\"18. The House of Lords dismissed the bank’s appeal but rejected\n\nthe reasoning of the Court of Appeal that wives were to be accorded special rights in\n\nrelation to surety transactions. Lord Browne-Wilkinson (with whom the other Law Lords\n\nagreed) in his judgment at p 428 to 429 of the report started by saying that he could find\n\nno basis in principle for affording special protection to a limited class in relation to\n\none type of transaction only. His Lordship went on to analyze as follows :\"In my judgment, if the doctrine of notice\n\n  is properly applied, there is no need for the introduction of a special equity in these\n\n  types of cases. A wife who has been induced to stand as a surety for her husband’s\n\n  debts by his undue influence, misrepresentation or some other legal wrong has an equity as\n\n  against him to setaside that transaction. Under the ordinary principles of equity,\n\n  her right to set aside that transaction will be enforceable against third parties (eg\n\n  against a creditor) if either the husband was acting as the third party’s agent or\n\n  the third party had actual or constructive notice of the facts giving rise to her equity.\n\n  Although there may be cases where, without artificiality, it can properly be held that the\n\n  husband was acting as the agent of the creditor in procuring the wife to stand as surety,\n\n  such cases will be of very rare occurrence. The key to the problem is to identify the\n\n  circumstances in which the creditor will be taken to have had notice of the wife’s\n\n  equity to set aside the transaction.The doctrine of notice lies at the heart of equity. Given that there\n\n  are two innocent parties, each enjoying rights, the earlier right prevails against the\n\n  later right if the acquirer of the later right knows of the earlier right (actual notice)\n\n  or would have discovered it had he taken proper steps (constructive notice). In\n\n  particular, if the party asserting that he takes free of the earlier rights of another\n\n  knows of certain facts which put him on inquiry as to the possible existence of the rights\n\n  of that other and he fails to make such inquiry or take such other steps as are reasonable\n\n  to verify whether such earlier right does or does not exist, he will have constructive\n\n  notice of the earlier right and take subject to it. Therefore where a wife has agreed to\n\n  stand surety for her husband’s debts as a result of undue influence or\n\n  misrepresentation, the creditor will take subject to the wife’s equity to set aside\n\n  the transaction if the circumstances are such as to put the creditor on inquiry as to the\n\n  circumstances in which she agreed to stand surety.…Therefore, in my judgment a creditor is put on inquiry when a wife\n\n  offers to stand surety for her husband’s debts by the combination of two factors: (a)\n\n  the transaction is on its face not to the financial advantage of the wife; and (b) there\n\n  is a substantial risk in transactions of that kind that, in procuring the wife to act as\n\n  surety, the husband has committed a legal or equitable wrong that entitles the wife to set\n\n  aside the transaction.It follows that, unless the creditor who is put on inquiry takes\n\n  reasonable steps to satisfy himself that the wife’s agreement to stand surety has\n\n  been properly obtained, the creditor will have constructive notice of the wife’s\n\n  rights.What, then are the reasonable steps which the creditor should take to\n\n  ensure that it does not have constructive notice of the wife’s rights, if any?\n\n  Normally the reasonable steps necessary to avoid being fixed with constructive notice\n\n  consist of making inquiry of the person who may have the earlier right (ie the wife) to\n\n  see whether such right is asserted. It is plainly impossible to require of banks and other\n\n  financial institutions that they should inquire of one spouse whether he or she has been\n\n  unduly influenced or misled by the other. But in my judgment the creditor, in order to\n\n  avoid being fixed with constructive notice, can reasonably be expected to take steps to\n\n  bring home to the wife the risk she is running by standing as surety and to take\n\n  independent advice. .. in my judgment a creditor will have satisfied these requirements if\n\n  it insists that the wife attend a private meeting (in the absence of the husband) with a\n\n  representative of the creditor at which she is told of the extent of her liability as\n\n  surety, warned of the risk she is running and urged to take independent legal advice. If\n\n  these steps are taken in my judgment the creditor will have taken such reasonable steps as\n\n  are necessary to preclude a subsequent claim that it had constructive notice of the\n\n  wife’s rights.\"19. On the facts, the House of Lords held that the bank knew the\n\nparties were husband and wife and should therefore have been put on inquiry as to the\n\ncircumstances in which the wife had agreed to stand as surety for the debt of her husband.\n\nThe failure by the bank to warn the wife when she signed the security of the risk that she\n\nand the matrimonial home were potentially liable for the debts of the company or to\n\nrecommend that she take legal advice fixed the bank with constructive notice of the\n\nwrongful misrepresentation made by the husband to her and she was therefore entitled as\n\nagainst the bank to set aside the legal charge on the matrimonial home. I should add here\n\nthat Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in summarizing his views (at page 431), extended the above\n\nstated principles beyond the husband-wife relationship to include cohabitees.20. It would appear that their Lordships, both in the Court of Appeal\n\nand the House of Lords, were constrained to treat the wife with more\n\n\"tenderness\" on the justification that (as shown at p 422 of the report) \"although\n\nthe concept of the ignorant wife leaving all financial decisions to the husband is\n\noutmoded, the practice does not yet coincide with the ideal. In a substantial proportion\n\nof marriages it is still the husband who has the business experience and the wife is\n\nwilling to follow his advice without bringing a truly independent mind and will to bear on\n\nfinancial decisions.\"21. The policy considerations that might have influenced the learned\n\nLaw Lords would obviously not apply in every case and certainly not to the facts of the\n\ncase before me, as will appear later in my judgment. It is important to take heed of the\n\ncautionary note sounded by the House of Lords to \"keep a sense of balance in\n\napproaching these cases\" and not allow a law designed to protect the vulnerable to\n\nrender the matrimonial home unacceptable as security to financial institutions and, I\n\nwould add, render the female partner in a relationship immune to legal liability. With the\n\ngreatest of respect, I am not sure the courts here should impose a burden on financial\n\ninstitutions to ensure that in every husband-wife or cohabitee situation, where the\n\ntransaction appears to be of no real financial benefit to the wife/cohabitee, the\n\nfinancial institution must arrange a meeting separately with the wife to warn her of her\n\npotential liability and to advise her to take independent legal advice. It may be taking\n\nrather too narrow a view of the marital relationship to look only at the apparent\n\nfinancial benefit to a spouse from a commercial transaction entered into by the other. If\n\nthe law should presume undue influence arising in such relationships (and the mother\n\n– son relationship as inLim Lie Hoa v Ong Jane Rebecca[1997] 2 SLR 320),should\n\nit not likewise presume financial benefit accruing to a wife from the commercial (and\n\ntherefore bread-earning) activities of the husband ? If so, then a wife who stands as\n\nsurety for her husband in a loan transaction should be presumed to derive at least an\n\nindirect interest in the funds being made available to the husband.22.Barclays Bank v O’Brienhas been followed\n\nrecently in Singapore in the case ofBank of India v Sujanani Thakur Rochiram &\n\nOthers (High Court Suit No. 600005/1998 - unreported).In that case, Lee Seiu Kin JC\n\nfound on the facts that a son had been subject to the undue influence of his father when\n\nhe executed guarantees and mortgages required by the bank to secure the facilities granted\n\nfor the use of the partnership business of his parents. From evidence adduced at the\n\ntrial, the Court came to the conclusion that the son had been completely overwhelmed and\n\ndominated by the father and the bank had actual notice of the father’s undue\n\ninfluence on the son.23. TheBank of Indiadecision is unique in its facts and I do\n\nnot see how it assists the 3rdDefendant in the instant case. There is no\n\nevidence in the affidavits of the 3rdDefendant to show that, being the wife,\n\nshe was so completely subjugated by the will of the husband that she could do nothing but\n\nobey him, and that the Plaintiffs knew or ought to have known of these circumstances.",
        "No undue influence; Lack of witness’ signature": "24. The facts of this case are clearly distinguishable fromBarclays\n\nBank v O’Brienin any event. Unlike Mrs O’Brien, the 3rdDefendant was a shareholder as well as director of the 1stDefendants. Mrs\n\nO’Brien was misled by her husband on the effect of the document she signed to secure\n\nhis debt. This is certainly not the case with the 3rdDefendant. I note that in\n\nOctober 1996 when she was called upon to sign the Deed of Guarantee, she wasde factofree\n\nof the husband, having entered into the Deed of Separation just two months back in August\n\n1996 which declares, among other things, that she and her then husband have agreed\n\n\"to live and will live separate and apart from each other effective from 27thJune 1996\". Further, the 3rdDefendant was required to guarantee the debts\n\nof a company in which she had an interest and continues to do so up to the hearing of this\n\nappeal although her interest and involvement in the business were significantly less than\n\nthe husband’s. It cannot therefore be said that she secured no financial benefit from\n\nthe facilities offered to the 1stDefendants for which she stood surety. In\n\nfact, as the Deed of Separation contemplates the transfer of her shareholding to her\n\nyoungest daughter upon her attainment of the age of majority and of whom the 3rdDefendant has custody, I would imagine that, as the mother, she would seek to ensure that\n\nthe shareholding to be given to her child would not be worthless.25. The 3rdDefendant is a businesswoman, being the director\n\nand majority shareholder of another company, Noahtu Trading Pte Ltd. and must be aware of\n\nthe obligations she undertook as surety. As disclosed in the Deed of Separation, she also\n\nheld the entire legal and beneficial interest in another company called Tamtu Investment\n\nPte Ltd. She was therefore no stranger to the world of bankers and financial obligations.\n\nShe had in fact participated in the management of the 1stDefendants’\n\nbusiness and had communicated with the Plaintiffs herself in her capacity as director. It\n\nwas also revealed that after the facilities under the 27 January 1997 offer had been\n\nutilized, she even had the business acumen to instruct the Plaintiffs to convert the\n\noutstanding debt from US$ to Japanese Yen which unfortunately for the Defendants caused\n\nthe debt to increase due to the appreciation of the Yenvis-a visthe US Dollar.26. It was not the wife’s case that she did not sign the guarantee\n\nor even that she did not know what she was signing. She was well aware of the obligations\n\nthat she undertook. Hence, the fact that the guarantee document does not bear the\n\nsignature of a witness is completely immaterial to the case.27. The affidavit of the intended witness, Diana Tee, is however\n\nsignificant as it shows that at the time the guarantee was signed by the wife there were\n\nno circumstances out of the ordinary that should have put the Plaintiffs on notice of the\n\nalleged undue influence operating on the 3rdDefendant. Neither did the 3rdDefendant allege that anyone else other than herself knew what pressures she had been\n\nfacing.28. In my opinion, no undue influence has been shown by the 3rdDefendant and even if the 2ndDefendant had attempted to exert such influence\n\non her, it could have had no effect on her free will whether to sign or not to sign the\n\nGuarantee.",
        "Irregularities in the account": "29. Counsel for the 3rdDefendant submitted that the\n\nirregularities in the account would afford the wife a partial defence. I do not see how\n\nthis allegation, even if true, can affect the wife’s liability under the guarantee.\n\nThe Plaintiffs, as bankers, surely cannot be expected to police the use of the funds by\n\ntheir customer and to ensure that the funds are properly applied to the customer’s\n\nbusiness operations. This would be an unduly onerous duty to impose on any financial\n\ninstitution. If there were abuses of the funds, that would be a matter entirely between\n\nthe 2ndDefendant and the company and its shareholders.",
        "Conclusion": "30. Judgment was entered against the 1stand 2ndDefendants as they clearly had no defence. The 1stDefendants had practically\n\nconceded judgment. The complaints made by the 3rdDefendant, both on undue\n\ninfluence and irregularities in the account, may perhaps found a claim against the 2ndDefendant as co-surety but they cannot stand as defences to the Plaintiffs’ claim on\n\nthe Deed of Guarantee. The wording of the Guarantee is in clear and unambiguous terms - it\n\nis binding as a continuing guarantee covering all monies due to the Plaintiffs by the 1stDefendants with no limit on the liability of the guarantors to any fixed duration or to\n\nquantum. Accordingly, I dismissed the 3rdDefendant’s appeal with costs of\n\nthe appeal fixed at $4,500.00.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
