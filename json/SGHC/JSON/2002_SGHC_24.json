        "Submissions at the close of the prosecution case": "13 At the close of the prosecution case, both the defence counsel\n\ninformed the court that they were not going to make any submissions. However, after the\n\ncourt posed a few questions to the learned DPP, counsel for the first accused made a brief\n\nsubmission (see page 306 of the NE). He submitted that the prosecution had not produced\n\nany evidence to show that the first accused was in possession of the amount of drugs\n\nreferred to in the charge despite his client’s statement admitting that he was\n\nrepacking heroin from a large packet to smaller sachets. Counsel also contended that the\n\nprosecution had not established that the first accused was the registered occupant of room\n\n406; the drugs seized were found in three different locations in the room ie, on the bed,\n\nin the bathroom ceiling and on the floor of the bathroom and that the prosecution had not\n\nestablished further the actual quantity the first accused was engaged in packing. There\n\nwas no submission from counsel for the second accused.14 The learned DPP in his submission invited the court’s attention\n\nto the unequivocal admissions by both accused persons in their voluntary statements as to\n\nhow they were handling and packing the drugs at room 406 at the material time.",
        "Ruling at the close of the prosecution case": "15 In my view, the case ofFoong Seow Ngui & Ors v Public\n\nProsecutor[1995] 3 SLR 785(CA) appeared to answer the submissions made on behalf\n\nof the first accused. In that case the third appellant Lim together with one Tan, the\n\nsecond appellant, were apprehended by CNB officers in the act of repacking drugs in a flat\n\nbelonging to Foong. Foong who was arrested on the ground floor of the flats admitted in\n\nevidence that the drugs seized were his. Lim denied possession of the drugs claiming that\n\nhe had only attempted to scoop half a spoonful of drugs into a small sachet so that he\n\ncould take it with him for his own consumption. In rejecting Lim’s explanation, Thean\n\nJA delivering the decision of the Court of Appeal said at page 802F:Reverting to the facts, counsel submitted that clearly there was an\n\n  absence of any pre-arranged plan which was a requisite in establishing the presence of a\n\n  common intention. Further, assuming that all three of them had joint possession of the\n\n  drugs, such joint possession does not amount to common intention to traffic in the drugs\n\n  in question. Accordingly, there was no criminal act committed in furtherance of a common\n\n  intention and the charge founded on s 34 was erroneous and all the three appellants had\n\n  been wrongly convicted on the present charge.We think that this argument ignores the relevant provisions of the Act\n\n  under which the three appellants were charged. As we have said inPP v Tan Aik Heng[1995] 2 SLR 241, the prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code to establish\n\n  liability of all the accused for the criminal act, ie the offence, committed by one or\n\n  more of them in furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was not the sale\n\n  and purchase of the one pound of heroin that took place between Tan and Foong at the\n\n  latter’s flat through the instrumentality of Lim. The criminal act was the\n\n  trafficking in the quantity of diamorphine in question at the material time, and the act\n\n  of trafficking was not any of the acts as defined in s 2 of the Act. The offence here was\n\n  founded on possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The basis for this is s\n\n  5(2) of the Act, which provides:For the purpose of this Act, a person commits the offence of\n\n    trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of\n\n    trafficking.Now, the question is who had possession of the drugs at the material\n\n  time. The drugs were found in Foong’s flat and he admitted that he was in possession\n\n  of the drugs, and had repacked the drugs into smaller sachets. As for Lim, he was caught\n\n  in the act of repacking the very same drugs in Foong’s flat. Lim also had possession.\n\n  Thus Foong and Lim were in joint possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in\n\n  them. Both of them committed the criminal act, ie the offence of trafficking.[Emphasis added.]16 Having considered the evidence adduced by the prosecution including\n\nthe statements recorded from the accused persons and having regard to the fingerprints of\n\nboth accused found in the exhibits recovered from room 406, on 17 April 2001, I was\n\nsatisfied that the prosecution had made out a case against both accused on the charge on\n\nwhich they were being tried, which if unrebutted would warrant their conviction.\n\nConsequently, both of them were given the standard allocution and were told of the options\n\navailable to them. In the event, they elected to give evidence on affirmation and their\n\nevidence in their defence can be summarised as follows.",
        "Defence of the first accused": "17 The first accused being divorced had been staying at Taipei Hotel\n\nfrom 14 to 17 April 2001. On 16 April 2001, he was the registered occupant of room 305 in\n\nthat hotel. On that day at about 11.00am, he went to a coffeeshop at Lorong 6 Geylang to\n\nmeet his friend ‘Boy’, a dark-skinned Chinese pimp. Boy had earlier arranged to\n\npick up the keys to a motor vehicle hired by the first accused. ‘Boy’ did not\n\nhire the vehicle himself as he did not have a valid driving licence. In the event, Boy\n\narrived and took possession of the keys to the vehicle, a Honda bearing registration\n\nnumber 2715; the first accused could not recall the prefix or suffix to the vehicle\n\nregistration number.18 After Boy had left with the keys, the first accused telephoned his\n\nfriend Dino, and invited him to join him for lunch at Beach Road Hawker Centre. The first\n\naccused had known the second accused since 1996.19 Later, after both the accused persons and the second accused’s\n\ngirlfriend, Hazel had lunch at the Beach Road Hawker Centre, all of them proceeded to\n\nHamilton Hotel at Lavender Street. Whilst they were there, at about 5.45pm, Boy telephoned\n\nthe first accused to say that he had no more use for the vehicle and that the first\n\naccused could collect the vehicle at Lorong 20 Geylang Road.20 Not long after, the first accused left by himself to pick up the\n\nvehicle at the given address where he had to wait a while before Boy appeared and handed\n\nthe keys to the first accused. At that time, Boy also handed $100 to the first accused\n\nrequesting him to book a hotel room at Taipei Hotel for Boy’s use.21 Just before he collected the vehicle, the first accused telephoned\n\nthe second accused and learnt from him that the latter was planning to go to his\n\ngirlfriend’s place of work at Pink Pussycat. The second accused invited the first\n\naccused to join him there.22 The first accused then picked up the second accused at Lavender\n\nStreet. Both of them left in the same vehicle to Taipei Hotel to book a hotel room for\n\nBoy. Whilst on the way to the hotel, the first accused received a telephone call from Boy\n\nwho enquired from the first accused about a box which Boy had earlier left on the rear\n\nseat of the vehicle. The first accused then requested the second accused to look behind to\n\ncheck whether the box was there. The second accused immediately turned around, picked up a\n\nbox which was there and showed it to him. The first accused duly informed Boy who was\n\nstill on the phone that the box was there.23 The box was about 50cm by 35 cm in size. Outside the box was the\n\ninscription ‘Polo’. Boy requested the first accused to take custody of it for\n\nhim. The second accused was then holding the box in his hands.24 In the event, both of them arrived at Taipei Hotel at about\n\nmidnight. There the first accused booked room 310 for Boy. At that time, room 305 was also\n\nregistered in his name. Both of them then made their way to room 406 which was then\n\nregistered in the name of the second accused. The second accused was carrying the box at\n\nthe request of the first accused. When both of them were in room 406 the first accused\n\nwanted to change his shirt which was kept by him in room 406 on the evening of 15 April\n\n2001. According to the first accused, although he was registered at room 305, he slept in\n\nroom 406 on 15 April 2001.25 He went to room 406 that evening also for the purpose of smoking\n\nheroin. The second accused who brought the box into the room opened the box to see what\n\nwas in it. When it was opened, the first accused happened to see a red-coloured plastic\n\nbag. Inside the plastic bag were many envelopes. The first accused directed the second\n\naccused to place the box and its contents on the bed. He then changed his shirt, smoked\n\nheroin together with the second accused and thereafter left the room. As they were at the\n\nreception counter of the hotel, the first accused met two girls named ‘Baby’ and\n\n‘Nik’. Baby told him that she had been asked by Boy to take the keys to the room\n\nbooked for Boy. He therefore obtained the key to room 310 from the receptionist and handed\n\nit to Baby. Baby and Nik presently left him for the room.26 Soon, both the first and the second accused were on their way to\n\nPink Pussycat at Orchard Towers and spent their time there until 3.00am. After that both\n\nthe accused persons and the second accused’s girlfriend Sasha went for a meal at\n\nAliwal Street and later returned to Taipei Hotel. The first accused repaired to room 406\n\nwhilst the second accused and his girlfriend left for room 305 to sleep.27 At about 4.00am, when the first accused was in the shower, he heard\n\na knock on his door. It was Boy who was at the door accompanied by a pregnant woman. He\n\nasked the first accused to let the woman sleep in room 406 for the night. After the first\n\naccused had invited her in, Boy asked him about the box. The first accused confirmed that\n\nit was with him. Boy soon departed after handing $200 to the first accused and requesting\n\nhim to send the pregnant woman for a check-up at a clinic when the first accused was free.\n\nAfter the woman entered the room, the first accused gathered the box, the red plastic bag\n\nand the envelopes which were on the bed and placed the box in a cupboard and the rest in a\n\ndrawer on a side table. He and the woman then retired to bed.28 At about 7.00am on 17 April 2001, the first accused left the hotel\n\nto drive a friend to the World Trade Centre and returned to the hotel at about 11.00am.\n\nAfter his return, he received a telephone call from Boy who informed him that he wanted to\n\nuse the motor vehicle as well as the hotel room. So the first accused left the hotel to\n\ndeliver the vehicle as well as the key to room 406 to Boy at Lorong 23. Having completed\n\nhis task, he went and bought some food for lunch for himself and his friends in the hotel.\n\nTwo packets of rice were delivered by him to Sasha at room 305 where the second accused\n\nwas sleeping. He next left for room 310 where he gave two packets of rice to Baby and\n\nconsumed one packet himself. He remained in room 310 until sometime past 4.00pm, when he\n\nreceived a telephone call from Boy who was in room 406, inviting him to go there to\n\nconsume heroin. When the first accused arrived at room 406, Boy, after returning the\n\nignition key to the vehicle to him, asked him about the box. The box was duly handed over\n\nto Boy by the first accused. Boy opened the box and finding it empty asked the first\n\naccused where the plastic bag and envelopes were. The first accused instantly opened the\n\ndrawer, retrieved the envelopes and the red plastic bag and handed them to Boy. After that\n\nhe entered the bathroom to take a shower.29 Whilst he was in the bathroom, he heard a knock on the door of the\n\nroom. He quickly put on his trousers and as he came out of the bathroom he saw Boy walking\n\ntowards the room door. At about this time, he happened to notice drugs in a tray placed on\n\nthe bed. The room door was soon opened but the latch within was still in place. He heard\n\nvoices outside the room saying they were police. He became frightened. Presently, he ran\n\ntowards the window and climbed out of the room and suddenly found himself in room 305. He\n\ndid not quite understand how he came to be in room 305. When he entered room 305, he\n\nnoticed that the second accused and Sasha were in that room.30 The second accused was shocked when he saw the first accused\n\nentering the room from nowhere. He asked the first accused where he was coming from. The\n\nfirst accused told him there was a police raid and as his urine was ‘dirty’ he\n\nfled from his room.31 The second accused also remarked that his urine too was dirty. The\n\nfirst accused asked the second accused for a shirt but there was no response from the\n\nsecond accused. Instead, the second accused quickly gathered his belongings and hurried\n\nout of his room. The first accused followed suit. When he ran out of the room, he was clad\n\nonly in his trousers. As he ran down by the staircase and reached the second level, he saw\n\na policewoman in civilian clothes. However, as she turned her face towards another\n\ndirection, he walked past her and ran to the rear of the hotel where he happened to find a\n\nwhite t-shirt. After slipping into it, he jumped over the wall, got to a nearby shop and\n\ntelephoned his younger brother. He told his younger brother that he was on the run from\n\nthe police.32 In the event, he met his brother at a coffee shop at No 527 Bedok\n\nNorth Street 3 and received $200 from him. Later that evening, he met his brother again\n\nand told him of his intention to go to his aunt’s house at Beach Road. Then between\n\nabout 8.00 and 9.00pm, his brother called and told him that Boy was at Block 527 Bedok\n\nNorth Street 3 with the wallet of the first accused. Boy also later telephoned the first\n\naccused in his aunt’s house and told him that he wanted to return the wallet to the\n\nfirst accused.33 They both arranged to meet at a coffee shop at Block 4 Beach Road.\n\nWhen they later met, Boy after handing over the wallet to him advised him to ‘make\n\nhimself scarce’ (page 407, line 3 of the NE). Boy then revealed to him then that he\n\nwas the one who had brought the seized drugs into room 406, earlier that day.34 After Boy had left, the second accused who was earlier contacted by\n\nthe first accused arrived at the coffee shop. The first accused narrated to the second\n\naccused what Boy had told him. At about 11.00pm that night, the first accused managed to\n\nslip into the car park of Taipei Hotel and retrieve the hired vehicle left there by him\n\nearlier. After the first accused had recovered the vehicle from the car park on 17 April\n\n2001, he never went back to Taipei Hotel.35 The first accused was arrested by CNB officers at Daisy Avenue on 20\n\nApril 2001 when he went there to return the motor vehicle to its owner. On 21 April 2001\n\nhe was charged in court for drug trafficking and was held in remand at the CID at Eu Tong\n\nSeng Street. Whilst he was in custody he made a number of statements to the authorities.\n\nHe confirmed that all the statements (exhs P-55, P-56, P-58 and P-59) recorded by the\n\ninvestigating officer were given by him voluntarily.36 Referring to para 2 of his statement (exh P-55) recorded on 24 April\n\n2001, he said that although he had implicated the second accused in his statements, it was\n\nnot the truth. He claimed that when he was arrested, the CNB officers were looking for the\n\nsecond accused only; they did not ask him anything about Boy. Moreover, at that stage, he\n\nwas labouring under the impression that the CNB officers would not believe him if he were\n\nto bring out the name of Boy whose particulars and full name he did not know. As he\n\nbelieved that the second accused had left for the safety of Malaysia, he decided to make\n\nuse of the second accused’s name rather than mention Boy. He also did not realise at\n\nthat stage that the second accused would be arrested. When asked by his counsel whether he\n\nrealised that making such a statement would be detrimental to his interest, his reply was\n\nthat he did not know it at that time as he was then in a confused state of mind (see page\n\n415 of the NE).37 He claimed that the second accused was not present in room 406 when\n\nthe police were at the door and that parts of para 2 of his statement in exh P-55 insofar\n\nas they purported to incriminate him and the second accused, were concoctions. He asserted\n\nthat except for the last ten lines of para 2 (beginning with the words: ‘I also\n\nclimbed down …’ and ending with the words ‘… I recognise him as\n\nDino’) the rest was untrue.38 He made a similar disclaimer and retraction to his statement (exh\n\nP-59) made on 3 May 2001. In relation to the said statement, he emphatically retracted the\n\nfollowing part at para 22 of that statement:Dino opened it. When I entered the room, I saw a tray of heroin on the\n\n  bed. I also saw some empty sachets, candles and a small digital weighing scale. Dino told\n\n  me that he was packing the heroin and asked me to help him seal the packets after he\n\n  filled them with heroin. I agreed to help him as the room was under registered (sic) my\n\n  name … and wanted to try out of curiosity. That was the first time I saw Dino\n\n  repacking a large amount of heroin.39 In the main, his defence was that on 17 April 2001 at 5.20pm or\n\nthereabouts, he was not in possession of any drugs either by himself or with the second\n\naccused nor was he trafficking in any drugs.",
        "Defence of the second accused": "40 He was also known as Dino. He came to know the first accused\n\nsometime in 1996. They did not maintain regular contact with each other until 3 April 2001\n\nwhen he chanced upon the first accused at a discotheque known as Makati. He met the first\n\naccused again at Makati on 4 April 2001. The first accused suggested that the second\n\naccused stay at Taipei Hotel as the rates there were low. Consequently, he started staying\n\nthere from about 5 April until 17 April 2001. During that period, the first accused was\n\nalso resident there.41 From 5 April 2001 until 14 April 2001 he and the first accused met\n\nalmost everyday. On 15 April 2001, he left Taipei Hotel at about 12 noon. He did not meet\n\nthe first accused that day. On 16 April 2001, the second accused was at Hamilton Hotel at\n\nLavender Street. On that day, he and the first accused met for lunch at Beach Road\n\ntogether with a girl named Hazel. After a while, all of them returned to Lavender Street.\n\nThat night at about 11.00pm, the first accused took the second accused in his vehicle back\n\nto Taipei Hotel. The first accused then booked another room in addition to the two rooms\n\nthat were already in his name. The rooms thus booked or registered in the name of the\n\nfirst accused were 310, 305 and 406. The additional room was reportedly for a friend of\n\nthe first accused. They then repaired to room 406 and after consuming heroin both of them\n\ndeparted for Pink Pussycat at Orchard Towers and remained there until about 4.00am on 17\n\nApril 2001.42 Shortly thereafter, both of them left for a meal at Jalan Sultan\n\ntogether with the second accused’s girlfriend Sasha before all of them returned to\n\nTaipei Hotel. After their arrival at the hotel, the first accused requested the second\n\naccused to take room 305 (page 594 of the NE). The second accused obliged and remained in\n\nroom 305 throughout the day, that is, until about 5.00pm on 17 April 2001 (page 594, lines\n\n23 to 25 and page 597, lines 1 to 7).43 At about 5.00pm on 17 April 2001, the first accused suddenly\n\nappeared in room 305. The second accused could not figure out how the first accused had\n\nentered the room since the door to the room was locked. He asked the first accused:\n\n‘From where have you come?’ The door was locked.’ The first accused told\n\nhim that he had entered the room by the window. The second accused asked him why he had\n\nentered through the window. The reply from the first accused was that there was a raid on\n\nthe room upstairs (page 597 lines 9 to 23 of the NE).44 Upon hearing this, the second accused panicked as he was then under\n\nurine supervision by the CNB. He wanted to avoid trouble and therefore immediately bolted\n\nfrom the room by the staircase. As he was making his way down, somewhere near the second\n\nlevel staircase a woman wearing a badge asked him in a rough voice: ‘Hey, where are\n\nyou going?’ He simply ignored her and briskly left the hotel. He did not know what\n\nhappened to the first accused.45 That evening, sometime past 7.00pm, the second accused reached his\n\nhome, changed his attire and left for a coffee shop downstairs. When he was at the coffee\n\nshop, his sister telephoned him to say that CNB officers had called at his house around\n\n8.00 to 9.00pm on 17 April 2001. He did not know why the CNB officers had called at his\n\nhouse. Later that night, when the first accused telephoned the second accused, the second\n\naccused enquired from the first accused what could have caused the CNB officers to call at\n\nthe second accused’s residence. The first accused advised him to meet him at a Beach\n\nRoad Coffee Shop. At Beach Road, the first accused told him what had transpired at room\n\n406 earlier that evening.46 Later that night, the second accused accompanied the first accused\n\nto Taipei Hotel in order to retrieve the rented motor vehicle left at the parking area\n\nthere by the first accused. The vehicle was eventually collected. Thereafter, the second\n\naccused together with the first accused left for the second accused’s mother’s\n\nflat at Kampong Arang. Leaving the first accused at the ground level of the block of\n\nflats, the second accused bounded upstairs to see his mother. But as he reached the flat,\n\nhe saw many pairs of shoes outside the entrance to his mother’s flat. Sensing\n\nsomething unusual, he decided to make haste from the place. Soon, he and the first accused\n\nleft for Aliwal Hotel at Aliwal Street. After spending sometime smoking heroin at the\n\nhotel both of them left for Pink Pussycat at Orchard Towers.47 The second accused endeavoured to explain to the court how his\n\nfingerprints happened to be found on the exhibits seized by the police from room 406\n\nparticularly on an envelope and a silver coloured box cover (exh P-89). His evidence in\n\nrelation to the fingerprint aspect was as follows.48 On 16 April 2001, the first accused came to fetch him from Hamilton\n\nHotel, Lavender Street. Later, when he was in the vehicle driven by the first accused,\n\nsomeone telephoned the first accused. The first accused presently asked the second accused\n\nwhether he could spot a box at the rear seat of the vehicle. The second accused, seeing a\n\nbox at the rear seat, lifted it up with his hand, showed it to the first accused and\n\nthereafter placed the box where it had been earlier.49 Subsequently, when they arrived at the hotel, he carried the box\n\nwith him and took it to room 406. There, noting the ‘beautiful appearance’ of\n\nthe box (the words were his – see page 611 line 19 of the NE), he was curious to find\n\nout what was in it. He then opened the box. There was a red plastic bag in it. He opened\n\nthe red plastic bag and found some envelopes. He happened to touch them. Eventually, he\n\nplaced them on the bed.50 The second accused also said that the three packets of medicine\n\nfound in room 406 were his. According to him he used some of the medicine on 13 April 2001\n\nand left them in the room on 14 April 2001.51 The next segment of his testimony concerned the statements he had\n\ngiven to the investigating officer after his arrest on 30 April 2001. He claimed that\n\nalthough the statements were given by him voluntarily, they were substantially untrue and\n\nthat they were fabricated by him in order to help the first accused as he felt he owed the\n\nfirst accused an obligation for the help he had received from the first accused in the\n\npast. He claimed that the drugs found in room 406 by the authorities had nothing to do\n\nwith him. In relation to the statement recorded from him on 3 May 2001 (exh P-60) he\n\nclaimed that except for the introductory paragraph, ie, para 1, as well as the last nine\n\nlines of the statement where he had detailed his hurried exit from the hotel, the\n\nremainder of his statement implicating him with the drugs found in room 406 were all\n\nuntrue and made up by him.52 He also disowned and retracted almost the entire statement given by\n\nhim on 5 May 2001 (exh P-61). He claimed that the statement was also concocted by him and\n\ndid not reflect the truth. According to him the only parts which were true in that\n\nstatement were the last two sentences in para 5 which read: ‘We went back to the\n\nhotel late at night. I slept in room 305 with my girlfriend Sasha while Talip [first\n\naccused] went to sleep in room 406.’53 In respect of his last statement (exh P-62) recorded on 9 May 2001,\n\nhe claimed that the following segments were not true and were made up by him:Para 9… About nightfall, I left to look for Talip’s\n\n  brother, Din. I went to a coffeeshop at Blk 527 Bedok North. I did that as I was holding\n\n  on to Talip’s wallet and I wanted to return the wallet to him. Din gave me the phone\n\n  number to Talip’s aunty’s house at Blk 4, Beach Road. … I returned his\n\n  wallet. …",
        "Para 12": "… I had kept two cigarette boxes … in the false\n\n  ceiling of the toilet in the room.54 The second accused said that he did not think far when he made those\n\nuntrue yet incriminating statements. Even though he was initially angry with the first\n\naccused, when he heard from the first accused that the latter had implicated the second\n\naccused, he did not manifest his anger to the first accused as the latter had helped him\n\npreviously. He felt he owed him something. He also did not realise the significance of his\n\nstatements at that time (pages 638 and 639 of the NE). However, when he was brought to\n\nCourt 26, had the charge read out to him and was made aware that the amount of drugs\n\namounted to about 78 grams, it occurred to him that he had made a huge mistake. His friend\n\n(the first accused) advised him to tell the truth in court and hence his present true\n\nstatements in court (page 642 of the NE).55 The second accused said that he had made reference to a pantry on\n\nthe fourth floor of Taipei Hotel from where he reportedly took delivery of the drugs but\n\nthere was no such pantry in the hotel.",
        "Rebuttal evidence by the prosecution": "56 The investigating officer was recalled to rebut, amongst other\n\nthings, the claim by the second accused that there was no pantry on the fourth level of\n\nTaipei Hotel. The investigating officer said that he had revisited the hotel together with\n\ndefence counsel as well as the DPP and asserted that there was indeed a storeroom (albeit\n\nnot a pantry in the strict sense of the word), 4 ft by 5 ft, situated on the fourth level\n\nof the hotel, almost opposite room 406 which housed mops, brooms, toilet papers and the\n\nlike. The investigating officer further testified that he had also revisited the opening\n\nin the bathroom ceiling in room 406 but was not able to say whether anyone could make an\n\nescape through that opening. He confirmed however that it was possible for persons to\n\nescape through the window of room 406. Later in re-examination, he agreed with defence\n\ncounsel that it might be possible for someone to crawl through the opening of the ceiling.",
        "Final speeches": "57 In his closing address, counsel for the first accused urged the\n\ncourt to accept the testimony of the first accused that he had nothing to do with the\n\ndrugs found in room 406 of Taipei Hotel and that the drugs were brought into room 406 by\n\nBoy without his knowledge and consent. Counsel also contended that the retracted\n\nconfessions of the accused did not reflect the truth; the prosecution had not proven its\n\ncase against the first accused beyond a reasonable doubt and in the circumstances the\n\nfirst accused was entitled to be acquitted of the charge. Counsel also urged the court to\n\ndraw an adverse inference against the prosecution for not calling two women whose names\n\nwere mentioned by the first accused in his statements as being those to whom he had\n\nallegedly narrated on 19 April 2001, his escape from Taipei Hotel.58 The essence of the submission by counsel for the second accused was\n\nsimilar. He too submitted that the prosecution had not proven the charge against the\n\nsecond accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that it would be unsafe for the court to\n\nconvict the accused persons solely based on their statements. Counsel also urged the court\n\nto accept the second accused’s testimony in court asserting his inocence as well as\n\nhis explanations as to how his fingerprints came to be found on the exhibits recovered\n\nfrom room 406 on 17 April 2001. The main point in the submission made on behalf of the\n\nsecond accused was that he was not in room 406 at the time the police knocked on the door;\n\nhe did not know anything about the drugs and that he fled from room 305 not because of any\n\ninvolvement with drug trafficking but because of his fear that his urine would have traces\n\nof drugs consumed by him at the material period.59 The learned DPP in his final speech urged the court to hold that the\n\nretracted confessions of both the accused persons represented the actuality of the\n\nsituation. He submitted that the fingerprints of both accused on some of the exhibits\n\nclosely connected to the drugs found in the room reinforced the prosecution’s version\n\nof the events. He further invited the court to hold that the events detailed by the\n\naccused persons in their statements as to how they went about handling and packing the\n\ndrugs in room 406, could not have been concocted.",
        "Findings and conclusion": "60 The first and paramount question which required to be determined by\n\nthe court in this case was whether the prosecution had proven that the accused persons\n\nwere in possession of the offending substance mentioned in the charge against them.61 In this regard, the prosecution relied almost exclusively on the\n\nvoluntary statements given by both accused and to some extent their fingerprints found on\n\nthe exhibits seized from the room. The forensic evidence as to the nature and amount of\n\ndiamorphine found as well as the correctness of the fingerprint examination was never in\n\ndispute.62 The incriminating statements given by the accused were disclaimed\n\nand retracted in the course of the trial by both the accused claiming that the statements\n\nwere not true and were made up by them to suit the occasion. The first accused’s\n\nstory was that although he had nothing to do with the drugs, he simply fabricated his\n\ninvolvement with the seized drugs since he felt that the investigating officer was\n\nunlikely to believe the existence and role of Boy whose particulars he did not have. As to\n\nthe reason why he implicated the second accused, he said that when he was arrested, the\n\ninvestigating officer questioned him only about the second accused and that he also\n\nbelieved at that stage the second accused had fled from Singapore for the safety of\n\nMalaysia.63 An immediate question that begged an answer at this juncture was if\n\nwhat the first accused narrated to the investigating officer was pure fiction, then how\n\nwas it that the second accused who was apprehended nearly 10 days after the arrest of the\n\nfirst accused, also incriminated himself and the first accused in respect of a very\n\nserious charge. In this connection, the second accused for his part came up with an\n\nequally disingenous explanation. According to him when he was arrested and taken to the\n\nCID lock-up, the first accused happened to mention to him that he had implicated the\n\nsecond accused because the first accused could not mention Boy as he did not know his\n\naddress. The second accused further claimed that seeing the dilemma the first accused was\n\nin and not otherwise, he decided to help his friend and corroborate the false story as he\n\nwas obliged to the first accused for some past favours.64 Dealing first with the defence of the first accused, if he was\n\nindeed as uninvolved with the drugs as he would want the court to believe, it was most\n\nimprobable that he would have exposed himself to a serious charge which entailed the death\n\npenalty. In my finding, his story that he simply passed up the opportunity to expose the\n\nreal villain and took the blame on himself and in that process falsely involved the second\n\naccused, was devoid of any truth. In my determination, if he was indeed an innocent victim\n\nof circumstances, the most natural thing for him would have been to narrate the\n\ncircumstances as they unfolded rather than spin a damaging yarn incriminating himself and\n\nworse implicating the allegedly innocent second accused when there was no pressure of any\n\nnature brought to bear on him by anyone in authority.65 Dealing with the protestation from the second accused claiming that\n\nhe was totally in the dark as to what transpired in room 406 when the police was at the\n\nroom door and that he had nothing whatsoever to do with the drugs, his claim too, in my\n\ndetermination appeared to repel probabilities. First, why would the second accused who\n\nreportedly fled from room 305 on 17 April 2001 in order to escape a much less serious\n\ncharge of consumption, decide to incriminate himself on a more damaging charge of\n\ntrafficking merely to return a favour to his friend? If his desire was just to corroborate\n\nwhat the first accused simply narrated to the investigating officer, why venture and\n\nmention the name of ‘Ah Boy’ as the supplier of drugs when the first accused\n\nhimself had conveniently omitted Boy’s name? Worse, why further elaborate on buying\n\nsachets, envelopes, candles and the rest for the repacking of heroin? Why mention taking\n\ndelivery of the drugs on the fourth floor pantry when there was reportedly no such pantry\n\nor delivery? Why mention all the foregoing details when such details did not feature at\n\nall in the account narrated by the first accused to the investigating officer? Above all,\n\nhow would the purported corroboration help his friend at all? In my evaluation, his\n\nbelated claims did not appear to possess any cogency.66 In my finding, both the first and the second accused were indeed in\n\nroom 406 repacking the drugs at the time the police arrived at the door for the raid and\n\nthat their current claims that they had nothing to do with the drugs found in the room or\n\nthat they were never engaged in repacking the drugs, did not appear to have even a\n\nsemblance of truth.67 Reviewing all the evidence, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the retracted confession of both the accused persons as to their presence in\n\nthe room handling and packing the drugs, reflected the truth and the reality of the\n\nsituation.68 The term ‘possession’ has been defined in many\n\nauthorities. Suffice it if I referred to a short passage in the speech of Lord Pearce inReg\n\nv Warner[1969] 2 AC 256 at 305C-D, where he said:For the same reason I do not think that possession was intended to be\n\n  limited by legal technicalities to one of two alternatives, namely, either to mere\n\n  physical possession or to mere legal possession. Both are forbidden. A man may not\n\n  lawfully own the drugs of which his servant or his bailee has physical possession or\n\n  control. Nor may he lawfully have physical possession or control as servant or bailee of\n\n  drugs which are owned by others. By physical possession or control I include things in his\n\n  pocket, in his car, in his room and so forth. That seems to me to accord with the general\n\n  popular wide meaning of the word \"possession\" and to be in accordance with the\n\n  intention of the Act.69 Returning to the facts of the present case on the basis of the\n\nevidence proffered by the prosecution and accepted by me, I was satisfied that the\n\nprosecution had proven beyond a reasonable doubt that both accused persons were in\n\npossession of the drugs referred to in the charge, both in its technical and real sense of\n\nthe term. The prosecution had further in my finding proven that both the accused knew the\n\nnature of the drugs. As to the amount of diamorphine found in the substance seized, the\n\nforensic evidence adduced by the prosecution was never a matter of debate.70 The next issue then was whether the drugs found in their possession\n\nwere for the purposes of trafficking. In this regard, there was a clear admission by both\n\nthe accused that they were engaged in repacking the drugs at the time the police arrived\n\nat the room door. This admission by itself justified the conclusion that the process of\n\nrepacking the drugs into small sachets could not be for any purpose other than for\n\ntrafficking. Further, the fact that the amount of drugs found and seized in the room was\n\nin excess of the amount mentioned in s 17 of the MDA, the presumption that the said drugs\n\nwere for the purposes of trafficking, unless it was proved that such possession was not\n\nfor that purpose, had been triggered. In my evaluation, there was no credible material\n\nplaced before the court to conclude that the drugs were for any purpose other than for\n\ntrafficking.",
        "Common intention": "71 The next issue concerned the accused person’s common intention,\n\nan ingredient of the charge against them. In this regard, reference must be made to s 34\n\nof the Penal Code which reads:When a criminal act is done by several persons, in furtherance of the\n\n  common intention of all, each of such persons is liable for that act in the same manner as\n\n  if the act were done by him alone.72 This section, as stated by the learned authors of Ratanlal (see\n\nRatanlal and Dhirajlal’s Law of Crimes, 23rdEdn, Vol 1, page 85) lays\n\ndown a principle of joint liability in the doing of a criminal act. The essence of that\n\nliability is to be found in the existence of common intention animating the accused\n\nleading to the doing of a criminal act in furtherance of such intention (Mahbub Shah\n\nv Emperor(1945) 47 Bom LR 941). It deals with the doing of separate acts, similar\n\nor diverse, by several persons; if all are done in furtherance of common intention, each\n\nperson is liable for the result of them all as if he had done them himself; ‘that\n\nact’ and ‘the act’ in the latter part of the section must include the whole\n\naction covered by a ‘criminal act’ in the first part, because they refer to it (Barendra\n\nKumar Ghosh v EmperorAIR 1925 PC 1).73 A relevant segment in the advice of Sir Madhavan Nair inMahbub\n\nShah(supra) at page 943 reads:… To invoke the aid of s. 34 successfully, it must be shown that\n\n  the criminal act complained against was done by one of the accused persons in the\n\n  furtherance of the common intention of all; if this is shown, then liability for the crime\n\n  may be imposed on any one of the persons in the same manner as if the act were done by him\n\n  alone. This being the principle, it is clear to their Lordships that common intention\n\n  within the meaning of the section implies a pre-arranged plan, and to convict the accused\n\n  of an offence applying the section it should be proved that the criminal act was done in\n\n  concert pursuant to the pre-arranged plan. As has been often observed, it is difficult if\n\n  not impossible to procure direct evidence to prove the intention of an individual; in most\n\n  cases it has to be inferred from his act or conduct or other relevant circumstances of the\n\n  case.74 The subject of common intention came up for further discussion in\n\nanother Indian case ofBashir v State of Allahabad(1953) AIR All 668 at 671\n\nwhere the court (per Desai J) observed:(13) What is meant by \"common intention\" is the\n\n  \"community of purpose\" or \"common design\" or \"common intent\"\n\n  …… [It] will not be wrong to interpret the words \"common intention\" to\n\n  mean \"community of purpose\", \"common design\" or \"common\n\n  enterprise\" which are the words used in the English Common Law. In –\n\n  ‘Mahboob Shah (sic) v. Emperor’, AIR 1945 PC 118 (D), \"common\n\n  intention\" was held to imply a \"pre-arranged plan\". This does not mean\n\n  either that there should be confabulation, discussion and agreement in writing or by word,\n\n  nor that the plan should be arranged for a considerable time before the doing of the\n\n  criminal act. The Judicial Committee in the ‘case of Mahboob Shah (sic) (D)’,\n\n  did not lay down that a certain interval should elapse between the formation of a\n\n  pre-arranged plan and the doing of the criminal act and did not negative the formation of\n\n  a pre-arranged plan just a moment before the doing of the criminal act. …75 On an issue relating to common intention in relation to a drug\n\ntrafficking case, the Court of Appeal (per L P Thean JA) inFoong Seow Ngui &\n\nOrs v Public Prosecutor([1995] 3 SLR at 802B-F) made the following comments:Reverting to the facts, counsel submitted that clearly there was an\n\n  absence of any pre-arranged plan which was a requisite in establishing the presence of a\n\n  common intention. Further, assuming that all three of them had joint possession of the\n\n  drugs, such joint possession does not amount to common intention to traffic in the drugs\n\n  in question. Accordingly, there was no criminal act committed in furtherance of a common\n\n  intention and the charge founded on s 34 was erroneous and all the three appellants had\n\n  been wrongly convicted on the present charge.We think that this argument ignores the relevant provisions of the Act\n\n  under which the three appellants were charged. As we have said inPP v Tan Aik Heng,\n\n  the prosecution has invoked s 34 of the Penal Code to establish liability of all the\n\n  accused for the criminal act, ie the offence, committed by one or more of them in\n\n  furtherance of their common intention. The criminal act was not the sale and purchase of\n\n  the one pound of heroin that took place between Tan and Foong at the latter’s flat\n\n  through the instrumentality of Lim. The criminal act was the trafficking in the quantity\n\n  of diamorphine in question at the material time, and the act of trafficking was not any of\n\n  the acts as defined in s 2 of the Act. The offence here was founded on possession of the\n\n  drugs for the purpose of trafficking. The basis for this is s 5(2) of the Act, which\n\n  provides:For the purpose of this Act, a person commits the offence of\n\n    trafficking in a controlled drug if he has in his possession that drug for the purpose of\n\n    trafficking.Now, the question is who had possession of the drugs at the material\n\n  time. The drugs were found in Foong’s flat and he admitted that he was in possession\n\n  of the drugs, and had repacked the drugs into smaller sachets. As for Lim, he was caught\n\n  in the act of repacking the very same drugs in Foong’s flat. Lim also had possession,\n\n  Thus Foong and Lim were in joint possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking in\n\n  them. Both of them committed the criminal act, ie the offence of trafficking.76 The principles articulated by Thean JA were equally applicable to\n\nthe case at hand. Reverting to the issues at hand, based on my finding that both accused\n\nwere indeed present in room 406 at the material time, handling and repacking the drugs,\n\ntheir common intention to traffic in those drugs could be clearly deduced. In my\n\ndetermination, their acts and deeds inside the room at about 5.20pm on 17 April 2001 were\n\ndecidedly in furtherance of their common intention to traffic in the drugs mentioned in\n\nthe charge. There could be no other conclusion.77 The findings and determination set out by me in the preceding\n\nparagraphs ought to, in my view, dispose of all the peripheral issues and feeble defences,\n\nsome of them hopelessly glib, raised on behalf of the two accused. However, for the sake\n\nof completeness the following observations need mention.78 Counsel for the first accused submitted that the prosecution had\n\nfailed to call two witnesses,BabyandAdikmentioned in paras 16 and 17 of\n\nthe statement (exh P-58). The contention was that the first accused had disclosed in his\n\nstatement that he spoke to these two women on 19 April 2001, two days after he fled from\n\nthe hotel about his escape and that the failure by the prosecution to call them warranted\n\nthe court to draw an adverse inference against it.79 First of all, counsel for the first accused himself conceded that he\n\nnever demanded, requested nor suggested to the prosecution that these two witnesses be\n\ncalled or made available to them although the prosecution offered a number of witnesses to\n\nthe defence at the time it closed its case. Secondly, even going by the first\n\naccused’s statement, his assertion was that he spoke to these two women on 19 April\n\n2001 about his escape. There was no suggestion that these women were ever in room 406 at\n\nthe time the raid was conducted. In any event, it was not incumbent on the prosecution to\n\ncall all and sundry to confirm a self-serving statement made by the accused persons days\n\nafter the event. In my view, the submission by counsel owed nothing to logic or reason.80 The next aspect of the defence submission concerned the footsteps\n\nheard on the ceiling by some police officers. Counsel for the first accused submitted in\n\nthis regard (see paras 39 to 40 of his written submission) that the probability of a third\n\nperson indeed existed and that the prosecution had failed to rule out or disprove such a\n\nprobability.81 The court was indeed mystified by the footsteps factor. From the\n\nfacts presented, I could not rule out the possibility that it might very well have been\n\nsomeone trying to get access into the opening in the ceiling. All said, the issue before\n\nthe court was not so much as to whether a third man escaped through the ceiling but\n\nwhether the two accused were present in the room handling and packing the drugs mentioned\n\nin the charge. Having regard to the findings I had arrived at in this case and having\n\nregard to the aspect that the alleged presence of Boy was raised by the first accused only\n\nduring the trial, the criticism that the prosecution had failed to rule out or disprove\n\nthe probability of the presence of the third party was entirely out of focus and\n\nill-conceived.82 As regards the second accused, his counsel mounted a vigorous\n\ncriticism of the manner in which the investigating officer recorded the second\n\naccused’s statement whilst at the same time, conceding that the statements emanating\n\nfrom the second accused were voluntary in nature and not tainted by any threat,\n\ninducement, promise or any form of oppression. It was contended by counsel that the\n\ninvestigating officer deliberately and purposefully recorded the second accused’s\n\nstatement to ensure that it was corroborative of the first accused’s statement. In\n\nthis regard, he relied on a frank answer from the investigating officer to a question by\n\ndefence counsel (see page 220 of the NE). As viewed by me, there was nothing out of the\n\nordinary or intrinsically wrong for an investigating officer to expect a measure of\n\nsequence and sense in the various strands of information he was engaged in collecting from\n\nthe witnesses. So long as the investigating officer had conducted his interviews without\n\nany threat, inducement, promise or any form of oppression and so long as the investigating\n\nofficer had not attempted to extract anything from the accused against his will, the\n\ncriticism levelled did not appear to have any validity or merit In any event, reviewing\n\nand comparing the statements of both accused, it did not appear that they were mirror\n\nimages of each other. Further, the very claim of the second accused was that he\n\nvolunteered those incriminating statements not because of any pressure from anyone in\n\nauthority but because he wanted to corroborate the first accused’s story in order to\n\nhelp him.83 The learned DPP in his closing submission (page 835 of the NE)\n\nhighlighted the aspect that the woman Sasha who was alleged to be in room 305 together\n\nwith the second accused could not be located by the prosecution and was not called by the\n\nsecond accused to corroborate his story. In my view, it was for the prosecution to prove\n\nits case beyond a reasonable doubt. However, the second accused, having given a voluntary\n\nstatement admitting to his involvement in the offence and his presence in room 406 when\n\nthe raiding party was at the room door, had a measure of burden, however little, to render\n\nself-help and lift himself out of the quagmire which was entirely of his own making. In\n\nfact, his defence in court was one almost bordering on alibi. If it was indeed his\n\ndefence, such a defence should have been disclosed to the prosecution at the earliest\n\nopportunity in order to give the prosecution time to investigate that defence. The tactics\n\nadopted by or for and on behalf of the second accused in springing a surprise defence of\n\nalibi midway through trial did not bode well for his defence. Given the facts, although I\n\nwas not inclined to draw any adverse inference against the second accused for not calling\n\nSasha, I was of the view that on balance of probabilities the second accused had not\n\nestablished his defence.84 Returning to the first accused, his belated mention of Boy during\n\nthe trial did not help him either. As I mentioned earlier, the versions narrated by the\n\nfirst as well as the second accused admitting to their presence in room 406 as well as\n\nrepacking the drugs, reflected the actual events of the day.85 Reviewing all the evidence in its totality, I was in the end\n\nsatisfied that the case against both accused had been proven beyond a reasonable doubt by\n\nthe prosecution and that the accused persons had not established their defence on balance\n\nof probabilities. Consequently, I found both of them guilty as charged, convicted them and\n\nsentenced them to the only punishment prescribed under the law.Sgd:MPH RUBINJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
