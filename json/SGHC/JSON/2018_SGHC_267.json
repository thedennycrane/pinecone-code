        "Introduction": "1 In the three committal applications before me, the plaintiff seeks to commit two individuals to prison for contempt of court. The plaintiff’s case is that the corporate defendant in this action has, in several material respects, breached a mareva injunction granted against it. But the plaintiff does not pursue the defendant for those alleged breaches. Instead, it pursues two representatives of the defendant for their involvement in its alleged breaches. 2 The two respondents to the committal applications are: (i) Mdm Selvarajoo Mageswari, the sole director of the defendant;1Foot Note 1×Affidavit of SM dated 10 June 2016, paragraph 5.and (ii) Mr Ramasamy Tanabalan, the general manager of the defendant.2Foot Note 2×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 1.Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan are husband and wife.3Foot Note 3×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 47. 3 The plaintiff alleges that each respondent has committed seven separate contempts of court. I have found Mdm Mageswari to be in contempt of court on three of the seven contempts alleged against her. I have found Mr Tanabalan to be in contempt of court on only one of the seven contempts alleged against him. For these contempts, the plaintiff submits that each respondent should be committed to prison for a term of three years.4Foot Note 4×Notes of argument dated 21 August 2018, page 9, lines 17 to 19.I have declined to commit either respondent to prison at all. Instead, I have ordered that: (i) Mdm Mageswari pay a fine of $25,000, in lieu of which she is to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of one month; and (ii) Mr Tanabalan pay a fine of $50,000, failing which he is to be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two months. 4 The plaintiff has been represented throughout this action, including in these contempt proceedings, by Mr Navinder Singh of KSCGP Juris LLP. The respondents were represented at the trial of this action and on appeal by Mr Palaniappan Sundararaj of Straits Law Practice LLC. In these committal applications, Mr Simon Tan of Attorneys Inc LLC appeared for the defendant once in the early stages of these committal applications. Thereafter, on various occasions, he appeared for the respondents. Most critically, he presented closing submissions of law for the respondents on both liability and sentencing. However, it is fair to say that the respondents have appeared for the most part in person in these committal proceedings. 5 The plaintiff has appealed against my decision on liability and sentencing in respect of both respondents. The respondents have not appealed against any aspect of my decision. I now set out the grounds for my decision.",
        "Background facts": "",
        "The writ and theinjunction": "6 The plaintiff provides engineering services to the oil and gas industry.5Foot Note 5×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, paragraph 6; affidavit dated 19 July 2016 at paragraph 4; affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 8.The defendant fabricates, assembles, modifies and installs marine engines and generators.6Foot Note 6×Affidavit of SM dated 10 June 2016, paragraph 4. 7 In 2011, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant under which the defendant was to manufacture ten diesel generators customised for an Iranian client of the plaintiff.7Foot Note 7×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, paragraph 9, page 39 and page 45.Disputes arose under that contract. As a result, in May 2012, the plaintiff issued the writ in this action against the defendant. 8 Three months after issuing the writ, in August 2012, the plaintiff applied8Foot Note 8×SUM3982/2012 filed on 6 August 2012; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 12.ex partefor and obtained9Foot Note 9×ORC3984/2012 dated 7 August 2012; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 220.a mareva injunction against the defendant. The injunction is largely in the standard form prescribed by the Supreme Court Practice Directions, adapted to the facts of this case. 9 In September 2012, on the plaintiff’s application, the mareva injunction was amended. The amendments describe with more accuracy certain specific assets which the plaintiff wished to bring expressly within the ambit of the injunction.10Foot Note 10×ORC4005/2012 dated 11 October 2012; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 229.Nothing turns on the amendments or on the period that elapsed between original injunction and the amendments. I therefore draw no distinction between the original injunction and the amended injunction. 10 The mareva injunction restrained the defendant from disposing of its assets in Singapore up to $1.5m11Foot Note 11×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 236.until trial or further order.12Foot Note 12×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 239.As a separate obligation, the injunction also ordered the defendant to preserve until the trial of this action eight specific items of machinery which were then in the defendant’s possession but for which the plaintiff claimed to have paid and therefore to own.13Foot Note 13×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 96.These eight assets formed part of the subject-matter of the plaintiff’s claim in this action.14Foot Note 14×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 232.Soon after commencing this action, the plaintiff made an unsuccessful application for a mandatory injunction requiring the defendant to deliver up these eight assets.15Foot Note 15×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 82. 11 The mareva injunction contains the following express provisions which are of relevance to the applications before me: (a) Paragraph 1(a) prohibits the defendant from removing from Singapore, disposing of, dealing with or diminishing the value of any of its assets in Singapore up to the value of $1.5m.16Foot Note 16×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 236. (b) Paragraph 1(b) specifies that the prohibition in paragraph 1(a) includes two specific groups of assets: (i) the property and assets of the defendant’s business and the proceeds of sale of any of those assets; and (ii) a specific Singapore dollar bank account which the defendant held with Standard Chartered Bank, identified in the injunction by its account number (“the SCB SGD account”).17Foot Note 17×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 236. (c) Paragraph 1(c) permits the defendant to deal with its assets or to remove them from Singapore so long as the total unencumbered value of its assets which are still in Singapore remains not less than $1.5m.18Foot Note 18×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 236. (d) Paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction obliges the defendant to inform the plaintiff “in writing at once” of all of its assets worldwide, “giving the value, location and details of all such assets”, and to confirm this information in an affidavit to be filed within 21 days after service of the order on the defendant.19Foot Note 19×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 237. (e) Paragraph 3 permits the defendant to spend “S$1,500 a week towards their [sic] ordinary living expenses” and also “$2,000 a week on legal advice and representation”. However, the paragraph obliges the defendant, before spending any money in this way, to tell the plaintiff’s solicitors where the money is to come from.20Foot Note 20×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 237.The reference in the plural to “living expenses” is, of course, wholly inapposite for a single corporate defendant. But again, nothing turns on that. (f) Paragraph 4 provides that the injunction does not prohibit the defendant from dealing with or disposing of its assets “in the ordinary and proper course of business” provided that the defendant accounts to the plaintiff “monthly for the amount of money spent in this regard”.21Foot Note 21×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 237.The account of “money spent” in the ordinary course of business is no doubt intended to include an account of assets disposed of in the ordinary course of business. (g) Paragraph 7 provides that the defendant cannot do anything prohibited by the injunction whether “itself or by its directors, officers, employees or agents or in any other way”.22Foot Note 22×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 238. (h) Paragraph 8 puts third parties on notice that the effect of the injunction is to make it a contempt of court “for any person notified of [the injunction] knowingly to assist in or permit a breach” of the injunction and that any third party doing so may be sent to prison or fined.23Foot Note 23×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 238. The mareva injunction was endorsed with a penal notice addressed to Mdm Mageswari as required by O 45 r 7(4)(b).24Foot Note 24×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 242.",
        "The trial and judgment": "12 The plaintiff’s action was tried before me in 2012 and 2013. In March 2013, I entered judgment25Foot Note 25×JUD488/2013; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 243.for the plaintiff on its claim and dismissed the defendant’s counterclaim for $96,000 (seeAero-Gate Pte Ltd v Engen Marine Engineering Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 409). After judgment was entered against the defendant at first instance, the mareva injunction continued in force as a post-judgment mareva injunction in aid of execution. 13 Although the defendant appealed against my decision, the Court of Appeal reversed only my decision to dismiss the defendant’s counterclaim. The judgment on the claim substantially in favour of the plaintiff was not disturbed on appeal.26Foot Note 26×ORC304/2014 in CA39/2013; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 247.The mareva injunction continued in force after the appeal. 14 The upshot is that plaintiff is a substantial judgment creditor of the defendant. That is so even after taking into account the defendant’s counterclaim for $96,000 allowed on appeal. 15 The judgment in this action at first instance required the defendant to: (i) deliver up the eight assets specifically identified in the mareva injunction or account to the plaintiff for the proceeds of their sale (see [10] above); (ii) to pay a liquidated sum of US$252,000 to the plaintiff; and (iii) to pay damages to the plaintiff to be assessed.27Foot Note 27×JUD488/2013; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 243.Those damages were assessed in November 2015 at just over US$606,000.28Foot Note 28×JUD8/2016; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 249.In addition, the defendant still owes the plaintiff a balance sum of just over $53,000 arising under a number of costs orders in this action and the appeal.29Foot Note 29×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017, paragraphs 10 and 11.Interest continues to accrue at the usual rate on the principal judgment debt as well as on the costs ordered. 16 The plaintiff has made several attempts to levy execution upon the defendant. Further, and in parallel with these committal applications, the plaintiff has used the examination of judgment debtor procedure in an attempt to obtain information from Mdm Mageswari in aid of execution.30Foot Note 30×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017, paragraph 15.Both avenues ultimately proved fruitless. The result is that the plaintiff has recovered only a small fraction of the judgment debt which the defendant owes. That recovery is probably insufficient even to cover its legal costs. The more frustrated the plaintiff became with the progress and results of the execution and examination of judgment debtor proceedings, the stronger its resolve became in these committal applications to have each respondent sentenced to imprisonment for a lengthy term of years.",
        "The defendant files an affidavit of assets in 2012": "17 As I have mentioned, paragraph 2 of the mareva injunction required the defendant to file an affidavit disclosing all of its assets. Pursuant to this obligation, on 28 August 2012, the defendant filed an affidavit of assets31Foot Note 31×Affidavit of SM dated 28 August 2012, paragraph 6.affirmed by Mdm Mageswari as its sole director. 18 The defendant’s affidavit of assets disclosed total assets said to be worth $4.4m comprising 70 sets of physical assets said to be worth $3.26m, trade receivables said to be worth S$1.1m and cash and bank balances said to be worth just over $44,000.32Foot Note 32×Affidavit of SM dated 28 August 2012, paragraph 8.The 70 sets of physical assets were all machinery, with some sets of assets comprising more than one unit of the same machinery. For convenience, I will refer to each set of physical assets as though it were a single asset. 19 The affidavit of assets disclosed that, of the 70 assets listed in the affidavit, 67 assets worth $3.09m were then located at the defendant’s premises at 12 Tuas Avenue 11, two assets worth $125,000 were located at the premises of Transvictory Winch System Pte Ltd (“Transvictory”) at 20 Third Chin Bee Road and one asset worth $35,000 was located at Offshore Marine Centre in Tuas South.33Foot Note 33×Affidavit of SM dated 28 August 2012, paragraph 6.",
        "Closure of the Standard Chartered Bank accounts": "20 In March 2014, Mdm Mageswari issued a letter of instructions to Standard Chartered Bank to close the SCB SGD account. Standard Chartered Bank had frozen the account ever since it had been notified of the mareva injunction. 21 In view of Mdm Mageswari’s letter, Standard Chartered Bank lifted the freeze on the account, released the balance to the defendant and closed the account.34Foot Note 34×Affidavit of SM dated 16 January 2017, page 36.",
        "The defendant moves assets in 2014": "22 In June 2013, the defendant’s landlord gave the defendant notice to vacate its business premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11.35Foot Note 35×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 6 and page 32.For various reasons, the defendant did not actually vacate these premises until March 2014.36Foot Note 36×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraphs 6 and 21. 23 In March 2014, the defendant wrote to the plaintiff to inform the plaintiff that the defendant had discontinued its operations at 13 Tuas Avenue 11 and to inform the defendant of the new location of 36 out of the 70 assets listed in the affidavit of assets. Mr Tanabalan made all arrangements for storage of the defendant’s assets.37Foot Note 37×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 5. 24 The March 2014 letter informed the plaintiff that, as a result of the move: (i) five assets were located at Transvictory’s premises; (ii) 19 assets were located at the premises of Singatac Engineering Pte Ltd (“Singatac”) at 21 Tuas Basin Lane; (iii) 11 assets were located at the car park at the premises of Engen Spares Pte Ltd and Engen Offshore Pte Ltd at 1 Soon Lee Street (“the Soon Lee Street premises”); and (iv) one asset comprising three units of the same machinery was split, with two units located at Singatac’s premises and one unit located at the Soon Lee Street premises.38Foot Note 38×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016 at pages 20 to 23; affidavit of TLCA dated 19 July 2016 at page 20.I shall refer to the five assets stored at Transvictory’s premises as “the Transvictory assets”. I shall refer to the 20 assets stored at Singatac’s premises as “the Singatac assets”. I shall refer to the 12 assets stored at the Soon Lee Street premises as “the Soon Lee Street assets”. 25 The defendant’s March 2014 letter valued the 36 assets listed in the letter at just over $1.5m.39Foot Note 39×Affidavit of TLCA dated 19 July 2016 at page 22.The letter made no mention of the remaining assets which had been disclosed in the affidavit of assets. The defendant was advised that it was not obliged to disclose the location of the remaining assets because the assets whose location had been disclosed added up in value to $1.5m, thus reaching the limit specified in paragraph 1(a) of the mareva injunction (see [11(a)] above).40Foot Note 40×Affidavit of TLCA dated 21 November 2016 at pages 106 and 107, paragraphs 3(a), 3(c) and 3(d); plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017, paragraph 60.On that basis, the defendant considered itself free under paragraphs 1(c) and 3 of the injunction (see [11(c)] and [11(f)] above) to deal with the remaining assets listed in the affidavit of assets. It did so.41Foot Note 41×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017, paragraph 60. 26 The Soon Lee Street premises – at which more than 11 of the 36 assets listed in the March 2014 letter were stored – are the premises of Engen Spares Pte Ltd42Foot Note 42×Affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016 at page 69.and Engen Offshore Pte Ltd.43Foot Note 43×Affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016 at page 62.The respondents do not, on the face of the record, currently have any interest or control in either company. But the plaintiff points out that the defendant shares a name and logo with both companies and that the respondents’ two children are the sole shareholders and directors of both companies. The plaintiff further points out that Engen Offshore Pte Ltd was incorporated only in August 201344Foot Note 44×Affidavit of TLCA dated on 20 June 2016, paragraph 26.and that Mdm Mageswari was a director of Engen Spares Pte Ltd right up until June 2013.45Foot Note 45×Affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 29 and page 66.Both those dates are shortly after March 2013, when I entered judgment in this action against the defendant.46Foot Note 46×JUD488/2013; affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 243.The plaintiff suggests that both companies are in fact owned and controlled by the respondents and that the defendant has diverted its assets to these companies in breach of the mareva.47Foot Note 47×Affidavit of TLCA filed on 20 June 2016, paragraphs 26 to 30; affidavit of TLCA filed on 28 June 2016, paragraph 29.That is denied by the respondents.48Foot Note 48×Affidavit of RT dated 7 July 2016 at paragraph 24; affidavit of RT dated 8 July 2016 at paragraph 33; affidavit of TLCA dated 21 November 2016 at page 111, paragraph 22.The evidence which the plaintiff has put before me does not suffice to establish this suggestion on the balance of probabilities.",
        "Singatac disposes of the Singatac assets": "27 According to Mr Tanabalan, in January 2016, he went to Singatac’s office to pay the principal of Singatac, Mr Tan Soon Keong (“Mr Tan”), the sum of $24,000 being the arrears of rental then due for storage of the Singatac assets. Mr Tanabalan was denied entry to Singatac’s premises on that occasion. Mr Tan later told Mr Tanabalan that Singatac had scrapped all of the Singatac assets for non-payment of rental.49Foot Note 49×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 8. 28 In evidence before me is a statutory declaration from Mr Tan50Foot Note 50×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016, paragraph 27 and pages 304 to 313.setting out his version of the same events. He corroborates Mr Tanabalan’s evidence in material respects. Mr Tan says that he agreed in February 2014 to rent space in the Singatac premises to Mr Tanabalan to store the Singatac assets for two months at a rent of $1,200. Mr Tanabalan failed to remove the Singatac assets upon the expiry for the two months and was uncontactable for the next eight months. In December 2014, Mr Tan scrapped the Singatac assets for just under $9,00051Foot Note 51×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016, page 312.because they were obstructing certain construction works which he was obliged to undertake. 29 The only difference of substance between Mr Tanabalan’s version of events and Mr Tan’s version of events is that Mr Tanabalan asserts that Mr Tan was aware that the Singatac assets were subject to the mareva injunction.52Foot Note 52×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016 at paragraph 8.Mr Tan denies any such knowledge.53Foot Note 53×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016 at paragraph 27; page 302 at paragraph 8; page 305 at paragraph 3.Nothing of relevance in these committal applications turns on Mr Tan’s state of knowledge.",
        "Transvictory disposes of the Transvictory assets": "30 Also according to Mr Tanabalan, and also in January 2016, he drove past Transvictory’s premises to check from the outside whether the Transvictory assets were still stored there. He could not see any sign of any of the Transvictory assets.54Foot Note 54×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 10.The principal of Transvictory is one Mr Richard Chiang (“Mr Richard”).55Foot Note 55×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016 at page 316.A few days later, Mr Tanabalan found out from a security guard at Transvictory’s premises that Mr Richard had sold all of the Transvictory assets in late 2015. Mr Tanabalan then spoke to Mr Richard directly. He confirmed to Mr Tanabalan that all of the Transvictory assets had indeed been sold because the defendant had failed to repay a loan of $300,000 which it owed to Transvictory.56Foot Note 56×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016, paragraph 12. 31 Transvictory flatly denies Mr Tanabalan’s evidence.57Foot Note 57×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016, paragraph 33 and pages 313 to 315.Transvictory’s position is that: (i) Transvictory has no knowledge of whether in fact Mr Tanabalan stored any of the defendant’s assets at the Transvictory premises; (ii) Transvictory did not dispose of the Transvictory assets; (iii) Mr Richard never told Mr Tanabalan that Transvictory had disposed of the Transvictory assets; (iv) Transvictory was unaware that the Transvictory assets were subject to a mareva injunction; and (v) Transvictory allowed Mr Tanabalan to have uninhibited access to the Transvictory assets on Transvictory’s premises in order to store and retrieve the Transvictory assets; and (vi) Mr Tanabalan could well have removed the Transvictory assets himself. 32 Mdm Mageswari lodged a police report in January 2016, alleging that the Singatac assets had been disposed of because of the defendant’s “inability to pay the rental” and that the Transvictory assets had been “disposed [sic] for non payment [sic]”.58Foot Note 58×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 257 to 258.",
        "Writs of seizure and sale": "33 As I have mentioned (see [16] above), the plaintiff has attempted to levy execution upon the defendant at various stages of this action.  I now summarise those attempts. Writ of seizure and sale in 2013 34 In January 2013, the plaintiff’s representatives visited the defendant’s premises at 13 Tuas Avenue 11 together with the sheriff to inspect the assets covered by the mareva injunction.59Foot Note 59×Affidavit of RT filed on 3 June 2016 at paragraph 6. 35 In September 2013, in execution of the plaintiff’s judgment, the sheriff seized 19 of the defendant’s assets under a writ of seizure and sale. In the affidavit of assets, Mdm Mageswari had valued these 19 assets at $1.05m. In October 2013, the plaintiff’s valuer, Exaco (S) Pte Ltd (“Exaco”), valued these 19 assets at $117,400.60Foot Note 60×Affidavit of TLCA dated 28 June 2016, paragraph 20. Writ of seizure and sale in 2014 36 In April 2014, the plaintiff inspected the Singatac assets.61Foot Note 61×Affidavit of TLCA dated 19 July 2016 at paragraph 12.In June 2014, the sheriff seized two engines at the Singatac premises under a writ of seizure and sale.62Foot Note 62×Affidavit of RT dated 3 June 2016 at paragraph 8.This writ of seizure was not followed through and there was no sale of these two engines by auction.63Foot Note 63×Respondents’ written submissions dated 10 April 2018, paragraph 4(c). 37 The defendant sent two further letters in May 2014 relating to the location of the Transvictory, Singatac and Soon Lee Street assets. It appears that this was in connection with the plaintiff’s attempts to have these assets seized and sold pursuant to the writ of seizure and sale.64Foot Note 64×Affidavit of RT filed on 3 June 2016 at page 28 and 29. Writ of seizure and sale in 2016 38 In January 2016, after its damages had been assessed, the plaintiff again levied execution on the judgment.65Foot Note 65×Affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 12.In February and March 2016,66Foot Note 66×Affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 12.the plaintiff’s solicitors asked the defendant for the current location of all assets frozen by the mareva injunction.67Foot Note 67×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, pages 250 and 251.In March 2016, the defendant replied68Foot Note 68×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, page 252.to say that the defendant had not changed the location of the assets frozen by the mareva injunction since the last update. This was presumably the update in March 2014. However, the defendant also informed the plaintiff that Mr Tanabalan had visited both Transvictory’s premises and Singatac’s premises in January 2016 and had discovered that all of the Transvictory assets and Singatac assets had been disposed of without the defendant’s knowledge or consent. 39 In July 2016, Mr Tanabalan affirmed an affidavit stating that the Soon Lee Street assets remained at the Soon Lee Street premises.69Foot Note 69×Affidavit of RT dated 8 July 2016, paragraph 29.In September 2016, in the course of the examination of judgment debtor proceedings, Mdm Mageswari affirmed an affidavit to the same effect.70Foot Note 70×Affidavit of TLCA dated 21 November 2016, paragraph 12, page 107 at paragraphs 4(a) and 4(b); page 110, paragraph 16.In November 2016, the plaintiff therefore applied for an obtained a writ of seizure and sale in respect of the Soon Lee Street assets.71Foot Note 71×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 9 and page 13. 40 Upon executing the writ of seizure and sale in December 2016, the plaintiff found only seven of the Soon Lee Street assets at the Soon Lee Street premises. The remaining five of the Soon Lee assets were missing.72Foot Note 72×Affidavit of TLCA dated 29 March 2017 at page 88; affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 9.Mr Tanabalan, who was present when the writ of seizure and sale was executed, informed the plaintiff’s representative that the missing items had been moved but was evasive about where they had been moved to.73Foot Note 73×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 11. 41 In January 2017, in anticipation of the sale of the seized assets, the plaintiff appointed Exaco to value the seven assets seized at the Soon Lee Street premises.74Foot Note 74×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 14.According to the Exaco report, many of these assets had been misdescribed in the defendant’s March 2014 letter and were worth much less than the value stated in that letter.75Foot Note 75×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 15. 42 The March 2014 letter had valued these seven assets at $188,000 in total. In January 2017, Exaco valued these seven assets at $15,600.76Foot Note 76×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 16.These seven assets were eventually sold at auction for $2,100.77Foot Note 77×Affidavit of TLCA dated 13 April 2017 at paragraph 17.",

At the plaintiff’s request, I ordered both respondents to be cross-examined on all of their affidavits. That cross-examination took place on one hearing day in August 2017.",
        "The contempt applications are protracted": "46 These committal applications have been unfortunately protracted. That is largely because the respondents have appeared in person for large parts of the proceedings. They sought adjournments on several occasions, often at the last minute. They gave various reasons for the adjournments: to file further affidavits, to try and find counsel or to try and raise money to pay fees for counsel. 47 I was conscious throughout that committal applications are quasi-criminal in nature and touch on the liberty of the respondents. The plaintiff made very clear that it intended to seek substantial sentences of imprisonment for both respondents if they were found to be in contempt of court. Indeed, the plaintiff consistently took the position that the respondents should be sentenced to six years’ imprisonment each82Foot Note 82×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017, paragraph 134; plaintiff’s written submissions dated 15 February 2018, paragraphs 9 and 27; and plaintiff’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018 at paragraph 54.before moderating that in its final submission to three years’ imprisonment each.83Foot Note 83×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 20 August 2018, paragraph 11, 39 and 48; Notes of Argument dated 21 August 2018, page 9 lines 17 to 19.Further, I had no reason to doubt the respondents’ pleas of impecuniosity. The respondents’ submissions to the contrary were bereft of evidence and built on mere supposition. 48 In those circumstances, I considered it incumbent on me to ensure that the respondents understood the nature and gravity of the case against them and had sufficient time and opportunity to respond meaningfully to that case even if that meant that these contempt proceedings took longer to resolve than they would have if the respondents had been able to afford representation throughout. Of course, I also bore in mind at all times that I should not subject the plaintiff to any substantive disadvantage by reason of the respondents being unable to afford representation.",
        "Applicable principles of law": "49 The principles of law which I must apply in order to determine whether either respondent is in contempt of court on any of the charges are not in dispute. They can be summarised in the following propositions: (a) The purpose of a mareva injunction is to restrain a defendant from dissipating his assets so as to render nugatory, wholly or in part, any judgment which a plaintiff might eventually obtain against it in the action:Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc[2007] 1 AC 181 (“Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plc”) at [10];84Foot Note 84×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 3.Lee Shieh-Peen Clement and another v Ho Chin Nguang and others[2010] 4 SLR 801 (“Clement Lee”) at [17].85Foot Note 85×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 5. (b) A party against whom a mareva injunction is issued must obey both the letter and the spirit of the injunction:Clement Leeat [17]. (c) A party who breaches an injunction will be punished by committal for contempt if the breach is sufficiently serious and the required standard of knowledge and intention is sufficiently proved:Customs and Excise Commissioners v Barclays Bank plcat [11].86Foot Note 86×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 3. (d) As against an alleged contemnor who is a party to the injunction or who is acting for or at the direction of a party to the injunction, the relevant standard of knowledge and intention is simply that: (i) the alleged contemnor had notice of the injunction; and (ii) he intended to do an act or to omit to act which is in fact a breach of the injunction. It is not necessary to go further and prove that the alleged contemnor intended to disobey the injunction or that he appreciated that he was doing so. So too, his reasons for breaching the injunction are irrelevant on the question of liability for contempt:Pertamina Energy Trading Ltd v Karaha Bodas Co LLCand others[2007] 2 SLR(R) 518 (“Pertamina Energy”) at [51];Maruti Shipping Pte Ltd v Tay Sien Djim and others[2014] SGHC 227 (“Maruti Shipping”) at [17]–[18];87Foot Note 87×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 7.Carey v Laiken(2015) SCC 17 at [29] and [47].88Foot Note 88×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 6. (e) As against an alleged contemnor who is a third party to the injunction, he may be in contempt of court if he either: (i) assists or permits a breach of the injunction; or (ii) deliberately frustrates the purpose of the court in making the order. In either case, the relevant standard of knowledge or intention is that the third party: (i) had notice of the injunction; (ii) does an act which the injunction restrains the party against whom it is directed from doing; and (iii) intended by doing those acts to impede or prejudice the administration of justice:AttorneyGeneral v Punch Ltd and another[2003] 1 AC 1046 at [87] per Lord Hope.89Foot Note 89×Plaintiff’s bundle of authorities, Tab 25. (f) Where an injunction is issued against a corporation, a director of the corporation who is aware of the injunction is under an obligation to take reasonable steps to ensure that the injunction is obeyed. This principle applies to every director who has notice of the injunction, whether executive or non-executive and whether involved in the day to day management of the corporation or not. If the corporation breaches the injunction, every director who has notice of the injunction and who wilfully failed to take these reasonable steps is in contempt of court:Maruti Shippingat [115]–[116]. (g) The standard of proof to which the applicant must make out his case against the alleged contemnor is the criminal standard,ieproof beyond reasonable doubt:STX Corp v Jason Surjana Tanuwidjajaand others[2014] 2 SLR 1261 at [8]. 50 In the case before me, there is no dispute that the defendant and both respondents had notice of the injunction. The defendant and the respondents were served with the injunction. The injunction contained a penal notice addressed to Mdm Mageswari, as the defendant’s director. From their ability to respond to the questions posed in cross-examination, I find that both respondents are sufficiently conversant in English to well understand the terms and import of the injunction. Indeed, the defendant and both respondents had the benefit of legal advice from the defendant’s trial solicitors on the scope of the injunction and the importance of complying with it.",
        "The O 52 r 2(2) statements": "51 Before turning to the substance of the charges, I must first deal with a preliminary point which Mr Simon Tan has raised for the respondents.90Foot Note 90×Respondents’ written submissions dated 29 May 2018, paragraph 16. 52 Not all of the seven charges against Mdm Mageswari arise from the two O 52 r 2(2) statements which the plaintiff presented under in its two committal applications against her. The allegation of contempt in the first O 52 r 2(2) statement against her is limited to the disposal of the Transvictory and the Singatac assets.91Foot Note 91×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, pages 9 to 11 at paragraph 8; affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 13.The allegations of contempt in the second O 52 r 2(2) statement against her are limited to: (i) the failure to disclose where the money spent on legal advice and representation was to come from; (ii) the failure to account monthly to the plaintiff for money spent in the ordinary and proper course of business; and (iii) the dealing with and disposal of the funds in the SCB SGD account.92Foot Note 92×Affidavit of EL dated 16 August 2016, page 17 at paragraph 17. 53 Of the seven charges which the plaintiff presents against Mdm Mageswari, I consider that only the fifth charge (see [115] below) arises from the first O 52 r 2(2) statement93Foot Note 93×Affidavit of TLCA dated 12 April 2016, pages 9 to 11 at paragraph 8.and that only the third and seventh charges (see [100] and [139] below) arise from the second O 52 r 2(2) statement. The remaining four charges against her are outside the scope of both O 52 r 2(2) statements against her. 54 So too, not all of the seven charges against Mr Tanabalan arise from the O 52 r 2(2) statement94Foot Note 94×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016 at page 18.against him. That statement was limited to the following allegations of contempt: (a) Mr Tanabalan failed “to take due care” of the assets covered by the mareva injunction and adopted “a callous attitude” towards them; (ii) Mr Tanabalan failed to pay rent to Singatac for storage of the Singatac assets; and (iii) Mr Tanabalan stored the Transvictory assets with Transvictory to whom the defendant owed money.95Foot Note 95×Affidavit of TLCA dated 11 November 2016 at page 23, paragraph 21. 55 Of the seven charges which the plaintiff presents against Mr Tanabalan, I consider that only the third, fourth, fifth and sixth charges (see [163], [174] and [187] below) arise from the O 52 r 2(2) statement. The remaining three charges against Mr Tanabalan are outside the scope of the O 52 r 2(2) statement against him. 56 Despite this, I have proceeded to hear and determine all seven charges against each respondent. The respondents have not appealed against my decision to do so. But O 52 r 5(3) prohibits the plaintiff from relying on any ground for committal which is not set out in the O 52 r 2(2) statement. And I accept that it is ordinarily unfair to a respondent to deal with the merits of an allegation of contempt which falls outside the scope of the O 52 r 2(2) statement on which leave was secured to apply for his committal. I therefore consider that I ought to explain why I heard and determined the combined fourteen charges of contempt against both respondents even though seven out of the fourteen charges fell outside the scope of the three O 52 r 2(2) statements against the respondents. 57 As the Court of Appeal held inMok Kah Hong v Zheng Zhuan Yao[2016] 3 SLR 1 (“Mok Kah Hong”), an O 52 r 2(2) statement is similar in purpose to a criminal charge. It is a procedural safeguard adopted to ensure that a person accused of contempt of court knows the case that the applicant makes against him. The O 52 r 2(2) statement therefore circumscribes the “boundaries of the applicant’s case, such as to prevent the applicant from relying on grounds that have been omitted from the statement”:Mok Kah Hongat [61]. 58 For the following three reasons, I have exercised my discretion under O 52 r 5(3) to permit the plaintiff to proceed on all fourteen charges against both respondents even though half of those fourteen charges do not arise from the three O 52 r  2(2) statements. 59 First, in the circumstances of these committal applications, I consider that none of the charges which fall outside the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement will take either respondent by surprise to the extent that the plaintiff has set out the case which it advances against each respondent on all seven charges in its written submissions in the committal applications. I have put the respondents on notice that these seven charges are being pursued against them. Each respondent has addressed the seven charges made against him or her and has presented arguments as to why he or she is not liable on any of them.96Foot Note 96×Respondents’ written submissions dated 29 November 2017 and 9 April 2018.The respondents have also agreed that I may consider on the merits all fourteen charges against them both, even though some of the charges fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statements.97Foot Note 97×Notes of argument dated 9 April 2018, page 5 line 19 to page 7 line 6; and page 15 line 19 to page 16 line 1. 60 Second, I do not consider that I am lacking any factual material relevant to either respondent’s defence which I ought to consider in order to arrive at a decision on the merits of all fourteen charges. The respondents have been cross-examined on their affidavits. The respondents have had the benefit of having the case against them on all seven charges put to them in cross-examination. Further, because both respondents were litigants in person for much of these proceedings, I have afforded them great latitude in addressing me from the bar table on questions of fact relating to all of the charges, even after their cross-examination concluded. 61 Mr Simon Tan submitted that the respondents would suffer real and actual prejudice if I were to hear and determine any of the charges which fall outside the scope of the O 52 r 2(2) statement. However, when he was pressed on this point, he retracted it.98Foot Note 98×Notes of argument dated 5 July 2018, page 18.He accepted that the only real prejudice to the respondents was they would not have had an opportunity to adduce only one item of evidence, and even then, that it was an item of evidence relevant only to mitigation: the evidence of their trial solicitor to confirm the legal advice which the respondents had received on their obligations under the mareva injunction. 62 The only relevance of this missing evidence is to support the respondents’ point that they were at all times acting in good faith in reliance on legal advice.99Foot Note 99×Notes of argument dated 5 July 2018, page 2 line 18 to page 18.Mr Tan accepted that that evidence could not be relevant on the issue of liability. I therefore addressed that specific prejudice by adjourning these applications after my decision on liability for contempt to allow the respondents an opportunity to secure and place before me their trial solicitor’s evidence as mitigation when I came to consider sentencing. In the event, for various reasons, the respondents did not take advantage of that opportunity. 63 Third, Mr Simon Tan accepted that if I were to dismiss any of the seven charges against either respondent on the purely procedural basis that those charges fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement, the plaintiff could immediately apply afresh for leave to commence contempt proceedings on those charges by serving fresh O 52 r 2(2) statements specifying these charges.100Foot Note 100×Notes of argument dated 5 July 2018, page 10 to page 12.On the facts of this case, and in light of my first and second reasons, I considered it to be contrary to the respondents’ interests to compel the plaintiff to pursue that course. These contempt applications have already been protracted. They have entailed a great deal of time, expense, inconvenience and anxiety for all of the parties. As between the plaintiff and the respondents, the respondents are least able to bear those burdens in connection with these applications and also in connection with any fresh applications for contempt which might be brought. 64 It was therefore, in my view, in the interests of both the applicant and the respondents – and also overall in the interests of justice and the efficient disposal of the entirety of the plaintiff’s case in contempt against the respondents – for me to deal once and for all in these proceedings with all fourteen charges of contempt which the plaintiff advances against both respondents, even though half of them fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement. The only qualification is that I accept that I must nevertheless be satisfied that each respondent has been given, through the plaintiff’s written submissions in these committal applications, sufficient notice with adequate particulars of those charges. 65 In those very unusual circumstances, I do not consider that any purpose would be served by rejecting any charge against either respondent purely on the basis that it falls outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement, in the absence of any actual, demonstrable prejudice to either respondent on a specific charge. 66 That is the limit of the indulgence which I am prepared to grant the plaintiff. In particular, to the extent that the plaintiff’s three O 52 r 2(2) statements have framed its charges against either respondent in a manner unfavourable to itself, the plaintiff will nevertheless be held to the consequences of those choices. Thus, for example, if the plaintiff has framed a charge against a respondent in a way which takes on the burden of proving an element of contempt which the law of contempt would not ordinarily require it to prove, the plaintiff will be required to prove that element. The respondents are entitled to take the plaintiff at their word and to have proceeded on the basis that if the plaintiff failed to prove any element of the charge as framed against him or her, the entire charge would fail. 67 I do not consider that the approach I have taken contradicts the very clear strictures of the Court of Appeal inMok Kah Hong. The ultimate goal of those strictures is to ensure procedural fairness for alleged contemnors. I consider that my approach, on the facts of this case, achieves that ultimate goal. In any event, without intending in any way to attenuate those strictures, I was prepared to exercise my power to proceed of my own motion on any charges of contempt against either respondent which fall outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statement. The purpose of doing so, in the unusual circumstances of this case, was to avoid the respondents from being vexed by fresh committal applications to deal with those charges on the merits. Nothing in O 52 is intended to prejudice my power to make an order of committal of my own motion if I am satisfied that it is warranted: see O 52 r 4 and alsoTay Kar OonvTahir[2017] 2 SLR 342 (“Tay Kar Oon”) at [38]. 68 I start by examining Mdm Mageswari’s liability on the charges against her before examining Mr Tanabalan’s liability on the charges against him.",
        "Liability": "",
        "Mdm Mageswari": "216 I have found Mdm Mageswari liable on the third, fourth, and seventh charges against her. The fourth and seventh charges relate to failure to disclose assets. The third charge relates to a disposal of assets. 217 I accept the evidence given by Mdm Mageswari that, in carrying out the acts which form the basis of the charges for which I have found her guilty, she: (a) relied on Mr Tanabalan and that it was reasonable of her to rely on him; and (b) genuinely believed that she was acting on the advice of the defendant’s solicitor, or – at the very least – that she was not acting inconsistently with his advice. By this, what I mean is that I accept that Mdm Mageswari subjectively thought that her actions were not in breach of the marevainjunction. That is, of course, no defence to a charge of contempt. But it can be mitigation. 218 I am conscious that Mdm Mageswari has failed to support this aspect of her mitigation by putting the defendant’s solicitor’s own evidence before me. She failed to do this even though both respondents specifically sought permission to do so and even though I granted them that permission. As a result, I have not heard from the defendant’s solicitor on the actual content of the advice which he gave to Mdm Mageswari. I am therefore in no position to judge, objectively speaking, whether the content of his advice was as Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan have testified. I make no finding on that issue. Nevertheless, having observed Mdm Mageswari giving her evidence and being cross-examined on it, I accept her evidence as to how sheunderstoodthe defendant’s solicitor’s advice. 219 As the court inTay Kar Oonnoted at [53], given the gravity of an order of committal and the fact that such proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, any reasonable doubt as to motive, intention or understanding should be resolved in the contemnor’s favour. I consider that that principle applies equally when determining the appropriate penalty for contempt as it does in determining liability for contempt in the first place. 220 Mdm Mageswari testified in cross-examination that she believed that she was at all times acting consistently with the advice of the defendant’s solicitor. She maintained that position when she was making her submissions to me orally. She maintained that position to the extent that, as her counsel informed me in closing submissions, she was willing to waive privilege and adduce evidence from the defendant’s former solicitor at the sentencing stage. In the event, he declined to give evidence and, I was informed, the respondents lacked the means to issue a subpoena to require him to attend. So I did not hear his evidence. But, as I have said, the question before me is not what advice the defendant’s solicitor actually gave Mdm Mageswari but how she understood that advice. On that issue, I accept her oral evidence. 221 I therefore find that Mdm Mageswari: (a) relied on Mr Tanabalan to hold the view – and did genuinely hold the view – that the assets which Mr Tanabalan had set aside amounted at least to $1.5m; and (b) did hold a belief that she was acting consistently with the legal advice received, or at the very least, that she was not acting inconsistently with it. I therefore cannot make a finding that she was acting in flagrant or contumelious disregard of the marevainjunction in any of the respects which I have found her to be liable. 222 Further, as regards the third charge against Mdm Mageswari, the amount involved in the withdrawal from the SCB SGD account isde minimisin both absolute and relative terms. The impact of this dealing on the underlying purpose of the marevainjunction – to preserve assets and to protect the plaintiff from a risk that those assets might be dissipated before judgment – is thus not sufficient to warrant imprisonment. As I noted earlier, committal to prison is a measure of last resort. 223 Similarly, the seventh charge against Mdm Mageswari concerns her failure to account to the plaintiff for monies spent on legal advice and in the ordinary and proper course of business. That failure is a failure to disclose sums which the defendant would have been entitled to spend in any event. It also bears noting that the plaintiff did not press for this disclosure contemporaneously, from month to month after the injunction was granted in August 2012, even though it must have been apparent to the plaintiff and its solicitors that the defendant was in persistent breach of this provision. The plaintiff complained of this failure only at the time it sought committal for contempt. That suggests to me that the defendant’s failure did not cause the plaintiff, on its own assessment, any substantial prejudice. 224 I find further that the fact that the plaintiff did not press the respondents to make this disclosure on behalf of the defendant contemporaneously further contributed to the defendant’s erroneous assumption – which at the very least was not inconsistent with the legal advice received – that this disclosure was not required (seeClementLeeat [47]).",
        "Mr Tanabalan": "225 I have found him Mr Tanabalan liable on the third charge against him. That concerns his acts in assisting or permitting the defendant’s failure to ensure that it did not deal with or dispose of assets up to the value of $1.5m. 226 Although the assets which were disposed of by Mr Tanabalan, and which formed the basis of the third charge against him, were of not insignificant value, I am doubtful that this caused the plaintiff much prejudice. I bear in mind that it has consistently been the plaintiff’s position in these contempt proceedings that the values of the physical assets listed in the affidavit of assets were inflated. I have found that part of the plaintiff’s case to be true. It seems to me that, due to the intrinsic nature of the defendant’s business, assets and finances, the plaintiff had little prospect of recovering substantial sums against the defendant in any event, quite apart from any breaches of the mareva injunction. 227 I also find that, to the extent that Mr Tanabalan overvalued the defendant’s assets, this was due to optimism and incompetence rather than due to dishonesty or a desire to mislead the court or to deprive the plaintiff of assets against which to levy execution. Optimism and incompetence are equally capable of impeding the due administration of justice as dishonesty. But a finding of optimism and incompetence suffices to take this case out of the line of authorities which establishes when a custodial sentence is warranted. This includesOCM Opportunities,Maruti ShippingandToyota Tsusho. So while Mr Tanabalan is guilty of contempt, I do not consider that his contempt warrants a custodial sentence. 228 As against both respondents, I also bear in mind that Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan did exhibit on occasion a desire to comply with the marevainjunction and to cooperate with the plaintiff. This can be seen, for example, from their letter dated 25 March 2014, in which they informed the plaintiff’s solicitors that 36 assets worth $1.5m had been moved. They notified the plaintiff of the new locations of these assets though they were under no continuing obligation to do so. 229 In these circumstances, I consider that the appropriate penalty for contempt for each respondent is as follows: (a) I order Mdm Selvarajoo Mageswari to pay a fine of $25,000; if she is unable to pay the fine within one month, she is to serve a term of imprisonment of one month in lieu thereof; and (b) I order Mr Ramasamy Tanabalan to pay a fine of $50,000; if he is unable to pay the fine within a month, he is to serve a term of imprisonment of two months in lieu thereof. 230 Although Mr Tanabalan has been found guilty of only one charge of contempt and Mdm Mageswari of three, I consider Mr Tanabalan’s single breach to be more serious than Mdm Mageswari’s three breaches, even when they are taken together. That is because Mr Tanabalan’s breach went to the root of the purpose of the mareva injunction, which is to preserve assets from dissipation. That is also because Mr Tanabalan, as I have found, was well aware that that would be the effect of his contempt. As a result, I consider it appropriate that Mr Tanabalan’s fine for his single breach is double the fine which I have imposed on Mdm Mageswari for her three breaches. 231 I make a final point. The plaintiff appears to think that the purpose of committal is to make the plaintiff whole for the loss it has suffered by reason of having fewer assets upon which to levy execution in order to satisfy its judgment debt. That is not the purpose of committal. Committal is not execution by other means. The purpose of committal is to vindicate the court’s authority by sanctioning and deterring those who act in disregard of that authority as expressed in an order of court.",
        "Sentence": "203 I have found Mdm Mageswari to be guilty of contempt of court on the third, fourth and seventh charges against her. I have found Mr Tanabalan to be guilty of contempt of court on the third charge against him. I now set out my decision on sentence.",
        "The law": "204 I first examine the guidance on sentencing for civil contempt given by the Court of Appeal. InMok Kah Hong, the Court of Appeal indicated that the following factors are relevant (at [104]): (a) whether the claimant has been prejudiced by virtue of the contempt and whether the prejudice is capable of remedy; (b) the extent to which the contemnor has acted under pressure; (c) whether the breach of the order was deliberate or unintentional; (d) the degree of culpability; (e) whether the contemnor has been placed in breach of the order by reason of the conduct of others; (f) whether the contemnor appreciates the seriousness of the deliberate breach; and (g) whether the contemnor has co-operated. 205 The law also recognises that distinctions should be drawn between breaches which are one-off in nature, and breaches which are either continuing or repeated in nature:Mok Kah Hongat [103]. Where one-off breaches are concerned, the overriding sentencing principle is punishment because there is no longer any coercive value to the sentence ordered, given that the contemnor is no longer in a position to remedy the breach. In the case of continuing breaches, however, the court takes into account both punitive and coercive elements:Tay Kar Oonat [56]. 206 Another important consideration to be taken into account is whether the contemnor’s non-compliance with the court order has become a matter of public concern:Tay Kar Oonat [57]–[58]. There is a public interest in the upholding of the court’s authority as expressed in orders of court. 207 Finally, it is very important to recognise that committal to prison is normally a measure of last resort, to be utilised where the court is faced with a recalcitrant and obstructive litigant in continuous breach:Toyota Tsusho (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd v Foo Tseh Wan and others[2017] 4 SLR 1215 (“Toyota Tsusho”) at [55]. As was the case inClementLee, where the advantage obtained by the contemnor as a result of the breach is the ability to spend more money, a financial sanction may be sufficient (at [49]). 208 In addition to these general principles, it is also important to recognise three key authorities so far as breaches of marevainjunctions are concerned. 209 The first authority is the case ofOCM Opportunities Fund II, LPand others v Burhan Uray (alias Wong Ming Kiong) and others[2005] 3 SLR(R) 60 (“OCM Opportunities”), a decision of the High Court. That case involved multiple breaches of a mareva injunction, including failures to disclose assets and failures to attend court for cross-examination pursuant to orders and directions given. The court found that the contemnors haddeliberatelydisobeyed the orders with no good excuse, under a single-minded objective of avoiding disclosure of their assets. There was clear defiance of the authority of the court. In the circumstances, the court ordered an imprisonment term of six months for each contemnor. 210 The second authority is the decision of the High Court inMaruti Shipping. In that case, the first defendant was found guilty of contempt of court for (a) preventing the execution of ananton pillerorder at two different premises; (b) withdrawing $380,000 from his bank account in breach of the mareva injunction; (c) failing to comply with disclosure requirements in the anton piller and marevainjunctions; and (d) failing to deliver his passport to the plaintiff in breach of ancillary orders made by the court. The court also made several other observations. The court noted that the defendant was a repeat offender, having breached a marevainjunction in the past. The court noted that the defendant, being a bankrupt, could no longer make good his breach. And the court noted that the defendant appeared to have dragged the proceedings on for more than three years, during which time much time and money had been wasted. In the circumstances, the court sentenced the defendant to six months’ imprisonment. 211 Although both of these authorities were decided before the Court of Appeal’s decision inMok Kah Hong, they were both cited by the Court of Appeal in that case without any apparent disapproval. 212 Finally, I note the case ofToyota Tsusho. That case involved the breach of disclosure obligations under a marevainjunction. The contemnor persistently refused to disclose his assets and instead filed affidavits of assets and means which lacked any credibility. The High Court found that the contemnor had acted in flagrant disregard of the marevainjunction, and sentenced him to three months’ imprisonment. I should note that that case was decided after the Court of Appeal’s decision inMok Kah Hong, and the guidance given by the Court of Appeal was taken into account in the sentence imposed.",
        "The plaintiff’s submission on sentencing": "213 At this point I pause to make a point about the plaintiff’s submissions on sentencing. The plaintiff’s initial submission, made repeatedly, was that I should sentence Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan to six years’ imprisonment each.171Foot Note 171×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 29 September 2017 at paragraph 134; Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 15 February 2018 at paragraphs 9 and 27; Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 9 April 2018 at paragraph 54.In its final submission, tailored specifically to the issue of sentencing and filed after my decision on liability, the plaintiff submits that I should sentence Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan to three years’ imprisonment each.172Foot Note 172×Plaintiff’s written submissions dated 20 August 2018 at paragraphs 11 and 39. 214 The authorities which I have cited should have made it clear to the plaintiff and those advising it that the sentence which it has sought in its submissions – whether imprisonment for six years or for three years – is completely unsupported by any authority binding on me or even persuasive to me and is excessive on any view of the law. It appears to me that the initial submission repeatedly urging a sentence of six years’ imprisonment was put forward not to assist the court – which is the only proper purpose of any submission – but to intimidate and oppress the respondents. The fact that that submission has been moderated to three years’ imprisonment in the further submissions is equally oppressive. 215 I now turn to consider the sentences to be imposed on Mdm Mageswari and Mr Tanabalan.",
        "Costs": "232 I have found both respondents guilty of contempt of court. Those breaches necessitated these committal applications. The plaintiff has been put to considerable expense and delay as a result. The plaintiff isprima facieentitled to the costs of these applications. 233 However, it is the case that the plaintiff has failed in the bulk of its charges. Mdm Mageswari has been found guilty only on three of the seven charges against her and Mr Tanabalan found guilty only on one of the seven charges against him. It is also the case that I have, as an extraordinary indulgence to the plaintiff, granted the plaintiff leave under O 52 r 5(3) to proceed against the respondents on charges which were not encompassed in the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statements. Those charges could have been rejected out of hand, with the plaintiff ordered to pay the respondents’ costs of dealing with them. While I have not taken that course, I consider that I am justified at this stage in depriving the plaintiff of costs on those charges. 234 In these circumstances, I order that the respondents shall be jointly and severally liable to pay to the plaintiff 50% of the plaintiff’s reasonable costs and disbursements of and incidental to the committal applications. I have reduced the plaintiff’s recovery on costs by 50% to reflect that the plaintiff has succeeded on only four out of the 14 charges of contempt against the respondents and has avoided an adverse costs order on the charges outside the scope of the relevant O 52 r 2(2) statements. 235 The plaintiff has asked that its costs be assessed on the indemnity basis. One of the grounds it relies on is the fact that these proceedings have been protracted by reason of the respondents’ conduct. I do not attribute the length of time that these committal applications have taken to fault on the part of the respondents. It is true that several adjournments were necessitated because they asked for additional time to prepare for hearings, to engage counsel or to look for funding to engage counsel. However, I accept that the respondents are impecunious. Further, I accept that having representation – especially in a matter of such gravity as committal for contempt – is not only of assistance to the alleged contemnors but also to the court in ensuring that justice is achieved. 236 In any event, in light of my findings on Mdm Mageswari’s state of mind, I am not prepared to order indemnity costs against her. As against both respondents, I consider that the plaintiff’s approach in bringing multiple charges of contempt in three committal applications militates against an order for indemnity costs. If the plaintiff had brought only the three successful charges against Mdm Mageswari and only the one successful charge against Mr Tanabalan and had succeeded on those four charges, I might have considered awarding indemnity costs on the ground that the respondents wouldex hypothesihave unreasonably resisted committal applications which had been wholly-successful. But as it is, I cannot say that either respondent acted unreasonably in defending the overly-broad committal applications which the plaintiff chose to bring. 237 The costs payable to the plaintiff will therefore be assessed on the standard basis.",
        "Conclusion": "238 All three of these committal applications have been motivated by a sense of grievance on the part of the plaintiffs. As the plaintiff says:173Foot Note 173×Affidavit of TLCA dated 19 July 2016, paragraph 29; affidavit of TLCA dated 20 June 2016, paragraph 33. The Plaintiffs take the position that Mdm. Selvarajoo Mageswari and/or the [defendant] ought not to get off scot-free. Mdm. Selvarajoo Mageswari’s and Mr. Ramasamy Tanabalan’s assurance “to cooperate with the Plaintiffs to find out the whereabouts of the [Transvictory and Singatac assets] and keep them informed of the outcome of [Mr Tanabalan’s] efforts to locate the [i]tems at the scrap yards in the country” is certainly not satisfactory to the Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs have been financially deceived by the [defendant] on numerous occasions, and have been further deprived of their fruits of litigation due to the [defendant’s] own failure to make payment of their alleged outstanding rental and/or loan charges which were due. It remains clear that the [defendant] ought to be liable for [its] failure to comply with the Mareva Injunction order and/or make full restitution to the Plaintiffs’ claim in Suit 373 of 2012 as well as all the unpaid costs. 239 The plaintiff’s sense of grievance is completely understandable but ultimately misconceived. In committal applications – and especially in these committal applications, in which the plaintiff initially sought to commit each respondent to prison for a term of six years – it is incumbent on a plaintiff to come to court with more than a sense of grievance, no matter how justified. It was therefore incumbent on this plaintiff to conceive a case for multiple contempts of court against the respondents which is internally consistent and which is supported by evidence sufficient to discharge its burden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. This it has abjectly failed to do on the bulk of the charges presented. On the remaining charges on which the plaintiff succeeded, I am not satisfied that a sentence of imprisonment is warranted.
