Consequently, the parties entered into a Second\n\nTenancy Agreement dated 23 June 1999 but this was in respect of the hotel rooms and not the health\n\ncentre.103.    There was disagreement as to who initiated the ideas leading to the Second\n\nRenovation Package and the Second Tenancy Agreement and who was responsible for the drafting of the\n\nSecond Tenancy Agreement. However it was not disputed that Mr Ang and Mr Ng had agreed to the Second\n\nRenovation Package and the Second Tenancy Agreement.104.    Each of the five quotations for the Second Renovation Package was signed\n\nby Mr Ng and counter-signed by Mr Ang.105.    The Second Tenancy Agreement, and a side letter also dated 23 June 1999,\n\nwere also signed by Mr Ng and Mr Ang.106.    Some of the works under the Second Renovation Package were completed but\n\nnot all.107.    Mr Ng alleged that Mr Ang had not signed on plans/drawings and had sent\n\nhis own contractors to interfere with Vegolds works. He also alleged that Mr Ang had deprived\n\nVegold of the services of the mechanical engineer it had engaged, one Gilbert Choo, by engaging the\n\nengineer after the engineer had been engaged by Vegold.108.    Mr Angs position was that Vegold had been dilatory in completing the\n\nworks.109.    I will deal with these allegations and counter-allegations as well as the\n\nsums claimed for the completed or partially completed items in greater detail below.THE SECOND TENANCY AGREEMENT (23 JUNE 1999) AND SIDE LETTER (23 JUNE 1999)110.    A Second Tenancy Agreement dated 23 June 1999 and a side letter also dated\n\n23 June 1999 in respect of the hotel rooms were subsequently entered into. The parties to the Second\n\nTenancy Agreement were GEH and Mr Ng. The parties to the side letter were Mr Ang of GEH and Mr Ng.\n\nBoth documents were signed by Mr Ang and Mr Ng.111.    Clause 3(a) of the Second Tenancy Agreement specified the monthly rent for\n\nthe hotel rooms to be $12,500.112.    Clause 5(r) stated that the tenant was to pay $12,500 for furniture\n\nfitting and $10,000 for the maintenance of the hotel. These two sums were not stated expressly to\n\nbe payable monthly but this was not really in dispute. The side letter specified that $10,000 out of\n\nthe rent of $35,000 was to be handed to Mr Ang.113.    The period in the Second Tenancy Agreement was stated to be an\n\nindefinite period from 1stday of October 1999 subject to termination, after three (3)\n\nyears leased (sic) period, by either party for whatever reason upon giving to the other three (3)\n\nmonths written notice of termination of the tenancy.114.    Under the side letter, the starting date was 15 October 1999, and not 1\n\nOctober 1999, as stated in the Second Tenancy Agreement.115.    However, Clause 6(k) of the Second Tenancy Agreement permitted the tenant\n\na period of two months for renovation rent-free. The date from which rent was to be payable was\n\ntherefore 15 January 2000.Counterclaim for loss of profit - $425,646 (paras 26 and 52 of Defence and Counterclaim)116.    Mr Ng alleged that Mr Ang had represented to him that there was an\n\nexisting hotel licence in the name of Damis Ang which would be transferred to Mr Ng. However he only\n\nlearned in August 1999, after the Second Tenancy Agreement and the side letter were signed, that the\n\nhotel licence had been revoked in April 1999 as the TOP for the building had lapsed (on 27 October\n\n1998).117.    He alleged in cross-examination that TOP was subsequently obtained again\n\nin September 1999 (NE 181 line 22).118.    He also alleged that he had to apply for a hotel licence and managed to\n\nsecure one in early December 1999 (para 25 of the Defence and Counterclaim).119.    In para 79 of his AEIC, he said he was granted a hotel licence on 6\n\nDecember 1999 after he had told the Hotel Licensing Board that Vegold would undertake to FSB (i.e\n\nFire Safety Bureau) that all defective work would be rectified.120.    I note that the hotel licence he had exhibited with his AEIC and also\n\nfound in AB 105 is in fact dated 1 January 2000.121.    I do not see how Mr Ng could have been misled about the existence of a TOP\n\nand hotel licence prior to the Second Tenancy Agreement and side letter.122.    According to him, Vegold was engaged to carry out works under the Second\n\nRenovation Package to obtain TOP and CSC. The discussion was in about May 1999 culminating in the\n\nfive quotations dated 10 June 1999 i.e before 23 June 1999 being the date of the Second Tenancy\n\nAgreement and of the side letter.123.    His evidence at NE 180 line 6 to NE 181 line 3 confirms that he was aware\n\nat the time that he entered into the Second Tenancy Agreement that the TOP had lapsed and that he\n\ncould not operate a hotel without a TOP:Q Since May or June 1999, you knew that the TOP for the building had lapsed?A Yes.Q You entered into the 2ndtenancy agreement relating to hotel rooms\n\n  on 23 June 1999?A Yes.Q So at the time you entered into the 2ndtenancy agreement, you\n\n  knew that the buildings TOP had already lapsed?A Yes.Q Your company Vegold was supposed to do the necessary work to obtain TOP?A Yes.Q From your knowledge as a contractor can a building be run as a hotel with\n\n  occupants if it had no valid TOP?A Cannot.Q At the time you entered into the 2ndtenancy agreement, you knew\n\n  the building could not be operated as a hotel until the TOP was obtained?A Yes.124.    Then at NE 184 line 20 to 24, he sought to resile from this position:Q Suggest: You knew at the time of the execution of the 2ndtenancy agreement that without TOP a party cannot hold a valid hotel licence.A Disagree. As long as the Hotel Licensing Board did not revoke the licence,\n\n  the licence is considered as existing even though there is no TOP. In fact this happened last year\n\n  in respect of this hotel.125.    Mr Ng also relied on Clause 6(l) of the Second Tenancy Agreement which\n\nrequires GEH to do the following:l) Transferring of all existing license pertaining to the operation of the\n\n  Premises to Mr. Ng Yew Seng, NRIC number S1319773/C, in which all fee pertaining to the transfer\n\n  of licensing will be bare (sic) by the Landlord.126.    Mr Nair submitted that this refers to the transfer of a licence if it was\n\nexisting as at the date of the Second Tenancy Agreement. By that date, Damis Angs hotel licence\n\nhad been revoked.127.    I accept this submission. Besides, I find that Mr Ng also knew, before he\n\nsigned the Second Tenancy Agreement, not only that the TOP had lapsed, but that the hotel licence\n\nhad been revoked as well.128.    Furthermore, all the hullabaloo about the hotel licence was a red herring.\n\nMr Ng had made this allegation to counterclaim loss of profit of $425,464 from 15 October 1999 to 31\n\nDecember 1999 for being unable to operate the hotel during this period.129.    However, it will be recalled that under Clause 6(k) of the Second Tenancy\n\nAgreement, he was granted a two month rent-free period for renovation. When this provision is read\n\nwith the start date of 15 October 1999 under the side letter, it is clear that he was not expected\n\nto commence hotel operations until 15 January 2000.130.    Furthermore, the evidence of his own witness Ho Quek Wee (also known as\n\nSimon Ho) was that Mr Ng had asked Mr Ho to do a survey first before commencing hotel operations.\n\nThe survey was done between May to December 1999. A forecast for the year 2000 was also done between\n\nMay to December 1999. Mr Ho did not say that he was doing a survey and a forecast up to December\n\n1999 because there was no hotel licence yet.131.    Clearly, Mr Ng was not intending to start hotel operations until 1 January\n\n2000 at the earliest.132.    Accordingly, Mr Ngs counterclaim for $425,464 for loss of profit under\n\nthe Second Tenancy Agreement must fail.Counterclaim for work, furniture and fittings - $281,129 (paras 44 to 46 and 60(a) of Defence and\n\nCounterclaim)133.    Mr Ng also counter-claimed $281,129 for expenses allegedly incurred under\n\neight invoices.134.    Two were from Brendma No 001/2000 and 002/2000 with a date Nov\n\n(presumably 2000).135.    The remaining six invoices were from Hong Mun Li Agencies to Brendma. Five\n\nwere dated between 26 November 1999 to 13 December 1999. The last one was dated 14 April 2000 (i.e\n\nInvoice No 5023) for three items totalling $12,800.136.    The basis of this claim was muddled.137.    Paragraph 23 of the Defence and Counterclaim mentions Clause 6(b), (d),\n\n(f), (g) and (l) of the Second Tenancy Agreement. However the actual claims under these invoices\n\nwere not pleaded as having been made under the Second Tenancy Agreement but under the Third Tenancy\n\nAgreement (see paras 44 to 46 of the Defence and Counterclaim).138.    Then, in Mr Ngs AEIC para 90, he made the claims for these invoices\n\nunder the Second Tenancy Agreement without specifying in para 90, or the previous paragraph, i.e\n\npara 89, which provision of the Second Tenancy Agreement he was relying on.139.    In closing submissions, Mr Tan Shiew Hwa for Mr Ng submitted that he was\n\nrelying on Clause 12(i) of the Third Tenancy Agreement which provided that the landlord was to\n\nensure that the premises was free of defects and in tenantable condition. He submitted that this was\n\nto be prior to handing over of the premises but this qualification was not stated in Clause 12(i) of\n\nthe Third Tenancy Agreement.140.    The qualification was, instead, found in Clause 6(g) of the Second Tenancy\n\nAgreement.141.    In any event, even if it was GEHs obligation to ensure that there was\n\nno defect and the premises was in a tenantable condition, I have to bear in mind that Mr Ngs\n\nVegold had been engaged to carry out various works.142.    Secondly, there was no supporting document for the works furniture and\n\nfittings itemised in the invoices, beyond the invoices themselves and some of the items were\n\nrepeated in different invoices.143.    For example, the single largest item for this counterclaim was in Invoice\n\nNo 5014 from Hong Mun Li Agencies dated 26 November 1999 (AB 56). The item was for $100,000 and was\n\nsupposed to be for the supply of marble and granite for the floor and wall of main entrance,\n\nreception area and fourth to seventh floor lift lobby.144.    However Mr Ng accepted that this was actually the same work under the\n\nFirst Renovation Package for which Vegold had sent two earlier invoices No 9781/98 dated 30\n\nSeptember 1998 (AB 6) and No 9812/99 dated 14 January 1999 (AB 15) to GEH.145.    I cannot see how Hong Mun Li Agencies could bona fide send an invoice for\n\nthe same item to Brendma on 26 November 1999, several months later. This cast even more doubt on the\n\nbona fides of all the Hong Mun Li Agencies invoices as well as on the two invoices from Brendma to\n\nGEH.146.    Thirdly, some of the items have nothing to do with defects or making the\n\npremises tenantable.147.    For example, I note that in one of the invoices from Brendma No 001/2000\n\nto GEH (at AB 511) there was a charge of $10,860 for 40 TV sets. In my view, the absence of TV sets\n\ndoes not make the premises defective or untenantable.148.    Also, it was not the landlords obligation to provide TV sets whether\n\nunder the Second or the Third Tenancy Agreement.149.    Fourthly, besides Mr Ng, no one else gave evidence on these expenses\n\nexcept Mr Casimir for the limited purpose I have mentioned.150.    I will now come to the items specifically claimed under this head and use\n\nthe numbering in Mr Casimirs report which in turn follows the numbering in Mr Cheongs report.\n\nWhere any item in any of the eight invoices is not listed in the reports, it will be disregarded.\n\nThe items claimed under this head and found in the reports are items 30 to 47.Item 30 - To supply one set of telephone system151.    There were two invoices for this item.152.    AB 150 is an invoice (without letterhead) naming GEH as the customer. It\n\nclaims $26,000 for the supply of one set of telephone system.153.    AB 511 and 512 is another invoice. This is Brendmas invoice to GEH No\n\n001/2000 dated November (presumably 2000). One of the items therein was for the supply and\n\ninstallation of a full set of telephone system for the hotel. It claimed $45,000. This claim is for\n\nitem 46.154.    Mr Casimir did not agree that there was an overlap between items 30 and 46\n\n(NE 146 line 1 to 3) but Mr Cheongs report and evidence (NE 101 line 1 to 13) were that they are\n\noverlapping. I accept Mr Cheongs evidence for items 30 and 46.155.    In Mr Cheongs Table 1, he accepted that this item had been done.\n\nHowever, I am not persuaded that this was due to any breach by GEH as there was no evidence of such\n\na breach.156.    Accordingly, items 30, and 46, are disallowed.Item 31 - Re-wiring and checking alarm system, changing I.C. panel and replace all dummy smoke\n\ndetectors157.    Item 31 is the subject of an invoice No 5013 dated 11 December 1999 from\n\nHong Mun Li Agencies (AB 67) for $16,000.158.    The same item is found in Brendmas invoice No 001/2000 to GEH.159.    I do not see how this item could have been the subject of a bona fide\n\ninvoice in December 1999 when Brendma was still complaining about the alarm system in January 2000\n\n(AB 103) and June 2000 (AB 162).160.    Furthermore, PW4 Nancy Lim, the manager and owner of Systron Technic\n\nEngineering, gave evidence that her firm had been engaged in May 2000 by GEH to rectify the fire\n\nalarm wiring system. In June 2000, she, or her engineer, discovered some defects with one of the\n\nheat detectors and a battery. Also, in or about June 2000, her firm was engaged by GEH to revamp the\n\nentire fire alarm system and wiring circuit (paras 4 to 6 of her AEIC and NE 66 line 5 to NE 67 line\n\n16).161.    I saw no reason to disbelieve her.162.    I disallow the claim for item 31.Item 32 - Repair air-con cooling tower and water heater163.    This item for $1,800 is found in an invoice dated 11 December 1999 and No\n\n5012 from Hong Mun Li Agencies to Eastern Park Health Spa (AB 66) i.e the health centre.164.    Yet it is also found in an invoice two weeks earlier dated 26 November\n\n1999 and No 5015 from Hong Mun Li Agencies to Brendma (AB 57) for $4,800 for servicing of cooling\n\ntower and AHU units from fourth to seventh floors.165.    The invoices were suspicious as the later one had a smaller serial number\n\ni.e 5012 than the earlier one i.e 5015.166.    The item for repair is also found in Brendmas invoice No 001/2000 in AB\n\n511.167.    Furthermore, PW3 Sng Yak Joo a director of Pitney Enterprise Pte Ltd (Pitney)\n\ngave evidence that in May 2000, Pitney had been engaged by GEH to carry out general repair and\n\nservicing of a cooling tower at the Property. Pitney was also engaged to do other work (see paras 4\n\nto 7 of his AEIC and NE 61 line 3 to 21).168.    I saw no reason to disbelieve Mr Sng.169.    I disallow the claim for item 32.Item 33- Repair main power room and main switch board with replacement of switch170.    This item for $3,750 is found in an invoice No 5012 dated 11 December 1999\n\nfrom Hong Mun Li Agencies to Eastern Park Health Spa (AB 66).171.    Yet in a subsequent letter dated 1 January 2000 from Brendma to GEHs Mr\n\nAng, Brendma was claiming that the manual generator was not working.172.    This item is also found in Brendmas invoice 001/2000 (AB 511).173.    Yet in the evidence of DW3 Ho Quek Wee, at NE 249 line 16 to 17, he said\n\nthat no one had rectified the problem.174.    I disallow the claim for item 33.Item 34 - Repair of pool chiller (at health centre)175.    This item for $6,750 is found in an invoice No 5012 dated 11 December 1999\n\nfrom Hong Mun Li Agencies to Eastern Park Health Spa (AB 66).176.    It is also found in Brendmas invoice No 001/2000 (AB 511).177.    However, there was no evidence before me that this work was in fact done\n\nbeyond the invoices themselves.178.    There was also no evidence before me as to why this should be attributed\n\nto a breach by GEH.179.    I disallow the claim for item 34.Item 35 - Payment to Mr Yeoh180.    This item for $3,000 is a duplication of the sum mentioned in paras 88 to\n\n95 above.181.    I disallow the claim for item 35.Item 36 - Supply labour and materials for telephone wires, new TAS line, repair water pump leakage,\n\nrepair air-con drainage pipe, check and inspect jacuzzi, sauna bath, steam bath182.    This claim is for $1,000. The parties agreed quantum at $500.183.    The claim is one of the items in Brendmas invoice No 001/2000 to GEH\n\n(AB 511).184.    There was no evidence that all the works done under this item were due to\n\na breach or breaches by GEH.185.    I disallow the claim for item 36.Items 37 - (a) To check and connect speaker for audio systemand 38 (b) Supply and lay TV cable, speaker cable and movie room186.    These items are found in Hong Mun Li Agencies invoice No 5011 dated 11\n\nDecember 1999 (AB 65) to Eastern Park Health Spa.187.    They are also found in Brendmas invoice No 001/2000 to GEH (AB 511).188.    Again there was no evidence hat they were done due to a breach by GEH even\n\nif they were in fact done.189.    I disallow the claims for items 37 and 38.Item 39 - 40 sets of TV190.    I have already dealt with this item in paras 147 and 148 above.191.    The claim for item 39 is disallowed.Items 40 to 45 - Various works192.    The quantum for these items was agreed at $1,450. They are found in Hong\n\nMun Li Agencies invoice No 5011 dated 11 December 1999 to Eastern Park Health Spa (AB 65) and\n\nBrendmas invoice No 002/2000 (AB 512).193.    There was no evidence that they were done due to a breach by GEH even if\n\nthey were in fact done.194.    I disallow the claims for items 40 to 45.Item 46 - To supply and install full set of telephone system for hotel195.    I have already dealt with this item when item 30 was dealt with.Item 47 - Payment for amendment of drawings196.    It was agreed that the quantum for this item be nil.Collection of furniture and articles197.    I would add that some time in or about October 1999, Mr Ng had arranged to\n\ncollect furniture and articles from another hotel owned by GEH for use in Brendma Eastern Hotel. The\n\nother hotel was at MacPherson Road and was known as Great Eastern Hotel. It was being sold,\n\napparently without the furniture and articles therein.198.    Mr Ng had tried to rely on this collection of furniture and articles to\n\nillustrate that GEH was obliged to provide the same for Brendma Eastern Hotel.199.    I am of the view that this was a situation whereby Mr Ang had agreed to\n\nassist Mr Ng since Great Eastern Hotel was being sold and GEH had no use for the furniture and\n\narticles in that hotel.200.    GEH was under receivership then but Mr Ang had agreed, and the receivers\n\ndid not object, that Mr Ng could collect the furniture and articles in Great Eastern Hotel for use\n\nin Brendma Eastern Hotel. However this did not mean that GEH was obliged to provide the same.201.    In the circumstances, I am of the view that the counterclaim for the\n\nalleged expenses under the eight invoices must fail.Complaint about the number of hotel rooms202.    In para 96 of his AEIC, Mr Ng complained that the building had 68 hotel\n\nrooms only instead of 78 contrary to what the Second Tenancy Agreement had stated.203.    However, this is not the subject of any specific claim in the Defence and\n\nCounterclaim.204.    Moreover, when the Third Tenancy Agreement was entered into, the number of\n\nhotel rooms was stated therein to be 68 and there was no change in the rent.205.    Accordingly, I need not concern myself any further about the allegation of\n\n68 hotel rooms.THIRD RENOVATION PACKAGE206.    According to Mr Ng, he discovered in or about September 1999 that\n\nadditional works were required to obtain TOP and eventually CSC.207.    A quotation of these additional works dated 15 November 1999 was sent by\n\nVegold to Mr Ang (AB 49 and 50). Mr Ang was agreeable to these additional works but wanted to pay\n\nfor them through the rental received (see Mr Ngs AEIC paras 82, 84 and 85).208.    As a result, the parties entered into yet another tenancy agreement dated\n\n24 November 1999 (the Third Tenancy Agreement) and a side agreement dated 25 November 1999\n\nentitled Mutual Agreement.209.    I summarise the works under the Third Renovation Package as follows:",
        "FSB requirements": "(a) To appoint an M&E engineer to obtain CSC (which appears to be already\n\n  included under the Second Renovation Package) and the appointment of RI (Registered Inspectors) to\n\n  obtain CSC.(b) Pressurized fans for (i) stair, (ii) corridor (third to seventh storeys),\n\n  (iii) smoke free lobby (third to seventh storeys).(c) To construct smoke free lobbies from second to seventh storeys.(d) (i) To construct half an hour fire rated doors for corridors from fourth to\n\n  seventh storeys.(ii) To construct three hour fire rated concrete wall for second and third\n\n  storeys(e) To construct pressurized air duct from rooftop to second storey, fourth to\n\n  seventh storey corridors.",
        "LTA requirements": "(f) To construct three mechanical car park barriers in front of the building .210.    Other details are found in the quotation.211.    Some of the works under the Third Renovation Package were done but not\n\nall. I will deal with the works allegedly done later together with the works allegedly done under\n\nthe Second Renovation Package.THIRD TENANCY AGREEMENT (24 NOVEMBER 1999) AND MUTUAL AGREEMENT (25 NOVEMBER 1999)212.    As I have mentioned, a Third Tenancy Agreement dated 24 November 1999 and\n\na Mutual Agreement dated 25 November 1999, were subsequently entered into.213.    The parties to the Third Tenancy Agreement were stated to be GEH and\n\nBrendma (not Mr Ng). Mr Ang signed this agreement on behalf of GEH and Mr Ng signed it on behalf of\n\nBrendma. Mr Ang and Mr Ng also signed the Mutual Agreement.214.    The Third Tenancy Agreement refers to 68 hotel rooms (instead of 78 under\n\nthe Second Tenancy Agreement) and 18 massage rooms.215.    The term is three years from 1 January 2000 with an option to renew for\n\nanother three years.216.    The rent is supposed to be a total of $57,000 per month i.e $35,000 for\n\nthe hotel rooms (as per the Second Tenancy Agreement) and $22,000 for the health centre (as per the\n\nFirst Tenancy Agreement).217.    However the Third Tenancy Agreement refers to a total of $37,000 per month\n\nonly, i.e $20,000 per month for the rent of the premises and $17,000 per month for the rent for\n\nfurniture and fittings.218.    The balance of $20,000 per month is to be set-off against Vegolds works\n\nunder the Second and Third Renovation Packages. Leaving aside some minor contradictions on the\n\nfigures, the total was supposed to be $831,730.219.    The set-off is covered by the Mutual Agreement dated 25 November 1999. On\n\nthis point, I am aware that the Mutual Agreement provided that Mr Ng is to pay $720,000 on behalf of\n\nMr Ang of GEH to Vegold and the monthly rent for Brendma is to be reduced by $20,000 over 36 months,\n\nwhich totals $720,000.220.    Although Mr Ng, Vegold and GEH are separate legal entities, the intention\n\nwas obviously for a set-off to be effected as between what Brendma has to pay GEH and what GEH has\n\nto pay Vegold.221.    Accordingly, I find that GEH need not pay Vegold any sum in view of the\n\nset-off under the Mutual Agreement, unless the amounts due and payable by it under the Second and\n\nThird Renovation Packages total more than $720,000.222.    If Vegolds completed works under the Second and Third Renovation\n\nPackages cost $831,730, there will be a balance of $111,730 due to it since the set-off of $20,000\n\nper month over 36 months totals $720,000 only. Nothing was said as to how the $111,730 is to be\n\npaid. This sum is different from and is in addition to the sum of $100,000 under the First\n\nRenovation Package.223.    In any event, as it turns out, the total cost of Vegolds completed\n\nworks under the Second and Third Renovation Packages is less than $720,000. I will elaborate on this\n\nlater.224.    Mr Ng gave the following reasons for entering into the Third Tenancy\n\nAgreement and the Mutual Agreement (see paras 94 to 102 of his AEIC):(a) First, he alleged that Mr Ang, and Mr Angs assistant one David Tien, had\n\n  represented to him in November 1999 that they wanted to persuade Malayan Banking Berhad (MBB)\n\n  to grant GEH additional facilities and a renovation loan. However because Clause 6(m) of the\n\n  Second Tenancy Agreement provided that the full renovation cost of $475,860 (under the Second\n\n  Renovation Package) would be set-off against the deposit and rent payable thereunder, GEH would\n\n  not be receiving any rent for some time.(b) Accordingly, the Third Tenancy Agreement was proposed whereby Clause 6(m)\n\n  would be deleted.(c) The Third Tenancy Agreement, however, would reflect rent of $37,000 per\n\n  month only to hide the true rent of $57,000 per month from the tax authority.(d) As Mr Ang was desirous of applying for a renovation loan in addition to the\n\n  additional facilities, the parties were to enter into the Mutual Agreement which would be shown to\n\n  MBB to persuade it to grant the renovation loan.(e) The Mutual Agreement would also serve as an I.O.U of the monies owing to\n\n  Vegold under the Second and Third Renovation Packages.225.    Mr Angs version was that Mr Ng wanted to remove Mr Yeoh as a named\n\nparty in the First Tenancy Agreement and Mr Ng also wanted to provide for all the amounts due under\n\nthe Second and Third Renovation Packages to be set-off against the rent. So, it became necessary to\n\nend the First and Second Tenancy Agreements for a fresh one to be entered into (see para 35 of Mr\n\nAngs AEIC).226.    I doubt that the Mutual Agreement was to be shown to MBB. If it was shown,\n\nit would have disclosed that a substantial part of the renovation costs would be paid by way of\n\nset-off against part of the rent. This would have obviated the need for any renovation loan.227.    I also doubt that GEH was going to seek additional facilities from MBB\n\nbecause no purpose was stated for such additional facilities.228.    In any event, even if the intention was to seek additional facilities from\n\nMBB, I am of the view that it was not the only or main reason for the Third Tenancy Agreement and\n\nthe Mutual Agreement.229.    In my view, the Third Tenancy Agreement was intended to consolidate the\n\nFirst Tenancy Agreement and the Second Tenancy Agreement into one agreement. Hence it covered the\n\ntenancy of both the health centre and the hotel rooms. It also specified the number of massage rooms\n\n(18) and hotel rooms (68) presumably to avoid any dispute thereon.230.    The Mutual Agreement was also to consolidate the agreements to set-off\n\nrent against the costs of the Second and the Third Renovation Packages, since the Second Tenancy\n\nAgreement covered the cost of the Second Renovation Package only.231.    As the Mutual Agreement mentioned the sums relating to the costs under the\n\nSecond and Third Renovation Packages, this was a tentative IOU subject to verification of the work\n\ndone.232.    The Third Tenancy Agreement and the Mutual Agreement also spread out the\n\nset-off over 36 months so that GEH would derive some income from the start thereof.233.    Under Clause 12(n) of the Third Tenancy Agreement, the rent for the hotel\n\nrooms is to start from 15 January 2000. This effectively means that no rent is payable under the\n\nSecond Tenancy Agreement because under that agreement and the side letter relating thereto, rent was\n\nalso payable from 15 January 2000.234.    Under Clause 12(n) of the Third Tenancy Agreement, the rent for the health\n\ncentre is to be payable from 1 January 2000.235.    This distinction illustrates the fact that the rent of $57,000 per month\n\nwas actually derived from two components, i.e $35,000 per month for the hotel rooms and $22,000 per\n\nmonth for the health centre, although the entire sum of $57,000 per month and the two components are\n\nnot expressly mentioned in the Third Tenancy Agreement.236.    The monthly rent of $57,000 is mentioned only in the Mutual Agreement\n\nwhich also does not apportion the rent expressly between the two components. The components are\n\nderived from the First and Second Tenancy Agreements.237.    I digress briefly to reiterate that the $22,000 per month rent for the\n\nhealth centre is not changed under the Third Tenancy Agreement even though the number of massage\n\nrooms is expressly stated under the Third Tenancy Agreement to be 18 (and not 22) rooms. That is one\n\nof the reasons why I concluded that Mr Ngs allegation that the rent under the First Tenancy\n\nAgreement should be reduced to $18,000 per month must fail (see paras 77 and 78 above).238.    As I have mentioned, Mr Ng managed to obtain a hotel licence effective 1\n\nJanuary 2000.239.    However, Mr Ng said that he was unable to renew it from 1 January 2001 as\n\nthe landlord had failed to give an undertaking to FSB. Accordingly Brendma had to cease hotel\n\noperations from 1 January 2001 although the operations of the health centre are carrying on.240.    I was also informed by Counsel for the parties that Brendma is still\n\noccupying the hotel premises although not operating the hotel and is waiting for GEH to do all the\n\nworks necessary to enable a hotel licence to be obtained, although Mr Julian Kwek, for GEH and Mr\n\nAng, intimated that there was some difficulty in getting access to the hotel premises. This\n\nsituation is likely to give rise to some more claims and counterclaims in the future.GEHs claim for rent (paras 23 to 25 and prayer (a) of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim)241.    At present, GEHs claim for rent relates to the rent of $37,000 per\n\nmonth (for the hotel rooms and health centre after set-off) under the Third Tenancy Agreement for\n\nthe period from 15 January 2000 to 14 June 2000, i.e for five months. This works out to $185,000.\n\nThere is no separate claim for the rent for the health centre for the period 1 to 14 January 2000.242.    GEH will also give credit for $44,000 received as part payment of rent i.e\n\n$22,000 in March 2000 and $22,000 in April 2000. The net amount claimed is $141,000 (see para 67 of\n\nGEHs Closing Submission) and not $159,500 as pleaded in paras 23 to 25 of the Re-Amended\n\nStatement of Claim.243.    Prima facie GEH is entitled to payment of $141,000. GEH is also claiming\n\ninterest. I note that Clause 4 of the Third Tenancy Agreement provides for rent to be paid on or\n\nbefore the 14thday of every calendar month and Clause 5 provides for interest to be\n\npayable at 10% per annum. Although Clause 4 also provides for GST to be paid to GEH, there was no\n\nevidence that GEH is in turn liable to pay GST.Counterclaim for personal loans of $44,000 (paras 43 and 54 of Defence and Counterclaim)244.    I should add that initially Mr Ng alleged that the two payments of $22,000\n\neach were loans by him to Mr Ang (para 109 of his AEIC) even though the payment vouchers described\n\nthe payments to be for rental for the months I have mentioned. He sought to give a convoluted\n\nexplanation to circumvent these payment vouchers (paras 109 to 111 of his AEIC) and even\n\ncounterclaimed re-payment of these sums.245.    However, Mr SH Tan conceded during the trial that these were part payments\n\nof rent and withdrew the counterclaim for the two sums of $22,000 each (NE 27 line 12 to 19).246.    Notwithstanding this concession, paras 3 and 4 of the Defendants Reply\n\nto the Plaintiffs/Third Partys Closing Submission sought to resurrect the allegation that the\n\npayments were personal loans and not payment of rent. This did not reflect well on Mg Ng or his\n\nCounsel.Allegation that $300,000 would be paid first by GEH or Mr Ang247.    Mr Ng alleged that in October 1999 Mr Ang had represented to him that the\n\nsale of Great Eastern Hotel was going to be completed and that Mr Ang, as a majority shareholder of\n\nGEH would receive about $3m. Also Mr Ang was in the process of selling one of his properties in\n\nGeylang. Mr Ang had promised to pay not less than $300,000 for the renovations by March 2000.248.    In view of this, Mr Ng said he was induced to lend two personal loans\n\ntotalling $44,000 and to enter into the Mutual Agreement (see paras 94 and 101 of his AEIC).249.    However, he also alleged that the representation was made in mid-March\n\n2000 (see para 109 of his AEIC).250.    Mr Ng was trying to give the impression that the obligation to pay rent\n\nwas dependent on Vegold having received the $300,000 first.251.    I do not accept Mr Ngs allegation about the $300,000 lump sum payment.252.    First, there is the discrepancy in the dates as to when the alleged\n\nrepresentation was made.253.    Secondly, there was no evidence that as at October 1999 or March 2000, Mr\n\nAng had satisfied himself that renovation works costing $300,000 under the Second and Third\n\nRenovation Packages had been completed.254.    Thirdly, the Mutual Agreement did not mention this $300,000 payment at\n\nall.255.    Fourthly, the $44,000 sum was not the result of personal loans but were in\n\nfact partial payments of rent as conceded by Mr S H Tan.GEHs claim for an account and inquiry, alternatively for damages (paras 28 to 32 and prayers (b)\n\nand (c) of Amended Statement of Claim)256.    GEH has also claimed an account and inquiry as to how the $720,000\n\n(comprising the set-off of $20,000 a month x 36 months) has been applied, and alternatively,\n\ndamages.257.    I am of the view that neither is an appropriate relief.258.    The $20,000 a month is to be used to pay whatever sums are due and payable\n\nto Vegold under the Second and the Third Renovation Packages. If the sums due and payable to Vegold\n\ntotal less than $720,000, then Brendma must pay the difference in the form of rent.259.    For example, if the sums due and payable to Vegold under the Second and\n\nthe Third Renovation Packages total, say, $200,000, then the set-off of $20,000 per month will apply\n\nfor ten months only and the full rent of $57,000 per month will be payable from the eleventh month.260.    However, this does not mean that any of the Defendants must account for\n\nthe balance of $520,000 or is liable for damages.261.    I also do not agree that Mr Ng had received $720,000 for the specific\n\npurpose of discharging the costs of the renovation works or that this could amount to some sort of\n\ntrust as submitted for GEH (see paras 83 and 84 of Plaintiffs and Third Partys Closing\n\nSubmission).262.    The agreement to set-off was a contractual one simpliciter and did not\n\ngive rise to a trust.263.    Accordingly, GEHs claim for such reliefs is disallowed.Counterclaim for loss of profit - $632,506.05 (para 46(a) to (e) and para 60(b) of\n\nDefence and Counterclaim)264.    Brendmas counterclaim for loss of profit for defective premises was\n\ninitially for $632,506.05. Some heads of claim were withdrawn during the trial leaving a total of\n\n$367,224.265.    The counterclaim for loss of profit was for the entire year 2000. However,\n\nas the counterclaim is deemed to have been commenced from the date of the action, any claim for loss\n\nof profits in this action should not go beyond 15 June 2000, the Writ having been filed on 16 June\n\n2000.266.    I would reiterate that Vegold was supposed to carry out works under the\n\nSecond and Third Renovation Packages.267.    However, by a letter dated 5 May 2000 from Vegold to GEHs Mr Ang,\n\nVegold decided to relieve itself from further responsibility to obtain the CSC. It said that its\n\nworks had come to a standstill because of constant interruption caused by GEH bringing in outside\n\ncontractors (AB 131).268.    Since then, if not earlier, Mr Ang appears to have engaged others to do\n\nrectification works.269.    Then in a letter dated 9 June 2000, from Drew & Napier for GEH, Drew\n\n& Napier stated that Vegold had failed to complete a substantial portion of the works it was to\n\ndo and that it was agreed that GEH would engage others and no other work was to be done by Vegold.\n\nThis was reiterated in Drew & Napiers letter dated 16 June 2000.270.    Accordingly, by May or June 2000, Vegold was relieved from doing any\n\nfurther rectification works.271.    Coming back to Brendmas counterclaim for loss of profits, Brendma\n\nrelied on various provisions i.e Clause 11, 12(f), 12(i), 12(e) and 12(o) of the Third Tenancy\n\nAgreement (paras 44 and 46 of the Defence and Counterclaim).272.    Under Clause 11 of the Third Tenancy Agreement, the landlord was to\n\nservice and upgrade the lift. If the lift was totally unservicable, the landlord was to bear all\n\ncosts of replacing another lift.273.    Under Clause 12(f) it was the landlords obligation to insure the\n\npremises against fire and public liability.274.    Clause 12(i) refers to the landlords obligation to ensure that the\n\npremises was free of defects and was in a tenantable condition. I have referred to this provision in\n\npara 139 above.275.    Clause 12(e) was a provision on quiet enjoyment of the premises by the\n\ntenant without interruption by the landlord.276.    Clause 12(o) referred to the transfer of all existing licences to the\n\ntenant.277.    At the outset, it is obvious that Clause 12(f) on insurance is not\n\nrelevant and Clause 12(o) on the transfer of existing licences is also not relevant as Brendma was\n\noperating under a valid hotel licence for the entire year 2000.278.    In para 185 of his AEIC, Mr Ng claimed that his hotel manager Simon Ho had\n\ntold him that the hotel lost revenue in the year 2000 due mainly to the leaking ceiling problems.\n\nMr Ng alleged lost revenue of $343,000 for the year.279.    Therefore, Clause 11 on the lift is not material. Neither is Clause 12(e)\n\nabout quiet enjoyment.280.    Only Clause 12(i) on defects and tenantable condition is relevant.281.    In Simon Hos letter of complaint dated 1 January 2000 (AB 102) to Mr\n\nAng, various complaints were made.282.    As Mr Ngs allegation on loss of profit is confined mainly to the\n\nleaking ceiling, I shall focus on that only. However, I would also mention that the letter of\n\ncomplaint was sent on the very first day when Simon Ho was engaged as manager of the hotel and the\n\nhotel had begun operations. Prior thereto, he was acting as a consultant for Mr Ng.283.    In cross-examination, Mr Ho said that ceiling boards were opened up and he\n\ncould see water dripping from the pipe. However he did not know that Vegold had been engaged to do\n\nthe piping for the hotel rooms (NE 250 line 7 to 13).284.    In AB 26 which is one of Vegolds quotations dated 10 June 1999 for the\n\nSecond Renovation Package, Vegold was to alter or redo the existing piping to PUB requirements and\n\nto comply with a PUB letter dated September 1997 for all necessary alterations for all piping\n\nsystems (although the September 1997 letter was not produced in evidence).285.    Mr Ng also admitted that Vegold was responsible for carrying out the\n\npiping works (NE 216 line 1 and 2). However, he tried to explain away this responsibility by\n\nalleging that he had done his best and the water leakage problems surfaced only when guests took\n\nbaths. He did not explain why he failed to take any further step thereafter (NE 216 line 4 to 15).286.    As Mr Ng controls both Brendma and Vegold, I am of the view that as at 15\n\nJune 2000, Brendma cannot complain about defective piping which was not rectified by Vegold even\n\nthough Brendmas tenancy agreement, i.e the Third Tenancy Agreement is with GEH. A party cannot\n\ntake advantage of his own wrong and this applies to corporate entities which are controlled by the\n\nsame person.287.    I also note that although Brendma was complaining about the leaking pipes,\n\nit did not cause substantive rectification work to be done but simply painted the stained walls (NE\n\n249 line 22 to 24). If the leaking pipes were really causing as much of a problem as Brendma would\n\nhave me believe, then, Brendma would not have stopped at painting the stained walls.288.    In the circumstances, I reject Brendmas claim for loss of profits up to\n\n15 June 2000 under the Third Tenancy Agreement.289.    It is therefore not necessary for me to deal with the evidence of Brendmas\n\nexpert witness Mr Chong Hon Hiong about the loss of profits in the form of loss of various streams\n\nof revenue. Furthermore, Mr Chong did not attempt to link any alleged breach by GEH to the alleged\n\nloss as what he did was a general exercise to determine loss of profits.290.    Likewise it is not necessary for me to deal with claims in paras 186, 187\n\nand 188 of Mr Ngs AEIC for alleged increase in advertisement charges, alleged engagement of\n\nadditional workers and alleged increase in maintenance and repair from faulty electrical wiring\n\nsystem respectively. Furthermore, these claims were not particularised in the pleadings.THE SECOND AND THIRD RENOVATION PACKAGES - continuedThe Second Renovation Package - continued291.    The five quotations for the Second Renovation Package amounted to $454,000\n\nexcluding GST (see para 100 above).292.    However, in Mr Ngs AEIC and according to his expert, Mr Casimir, Vegold\n\nshould be entitled to $148,450, excluding GST, for work done under the Second Renovation Package.293.    Mr Cheong recommended $119,000.294.    In addition, Mr Ng claimed that Vegold was prevented from completing the\n\nworks under the Second and Third Renovation Packages and claimed various sums which I will elaborate\n\non later.295.    The alleged completed works under the Second Renovation Package were items\n\n11 to 19 of Mr Cheongs and Mr Casimirs reports. I will deal with the items individually.Item 11 -      (a) To engage TKS (Tan Khee\n\nSeng) as building architect to obtain TOP and CSC and also to obtainapprovals or licences from FSB and URA(b) To engage M&E engineer to obtain PUB approval or licence(c) To submit documents to regulatory authorities296.    Mr Casimir recommended $42,750 for this item instead of the quoted sum of\n\n$57,000 because CSC had not been obtained.297.    Mr Casimir referred to Mr Cheongs Table 1 in p 37A of Mr Cheongs\n\nAEIC.298.    In the light of Mr Cheongs comment that CSC has not been obtained, Mr\n\nCasimir concluded that TOP had been obtained. Also Mr Cheong had referred to the approval of certain\n\nbuilding plans which Mr Casimir had assumed was the result of work done by Vegold or on Vegolds\n\ninstructions.299.    However Mr Casimir had not seen any drawings or checked with the architect\n\nor the M&E engineer that work had been done on Vegolds instructions.300.    Mr Casimir also referred to a letter dated 23 August 1999 from Prodecon\n\nArchitects to the Commissioner of Building Control (AB 43). This letter stated that TOP had been\n\nobtained but had expired and these architects were assisting GEH to renew TOP and obtain CSC.301.    Mr Casimir had assumed that Vegold had done all the work necessary to\n\nobtain the TOP which had expired but Vegold only came into the picture in June 1999. The TOP which\n\nhad expired, had lapsed even before May 1999, see para 116 above.302.    Also, the dates of the building plans referred to in Mr Cheongs Table 1\n\nwere before the date Vegold had been engaged.303.    It seems to me that Mr Casimir had assumed that Vegold had submitted plans\n\nor drawings to obtain the expired TOP when this was not necessarily the case.304.    Neither did he see any plan or drawing done on Vegolds instructions to\n\nobtain the fresh TOP (NE 131 line 19/20, NE 135 line 8 to 10).305.    Mr Casimir agreed that if in fact Vegold did not do any work under item\n\n11, it should not be paid anything. If they did some work but did not make the submission for TOP,\n\nthen his valuation would be less (NE 136 line 1 to 4).306.    On the other hand, Mr Cheong said that he valued the item at $28,000 as\n\nCSC had not been obtained (see his AEIC p 37A for item 11). This comment gives the impression that\n\nTOP had been obtained but not CSC.307.    However, in cross-examination, Mr Cheong said that he understood from Mr\n\nAng that both TOP and CSC had not been obtained at the time he inspected the premises on 24 June\n\n2000 and on 18 July 2000. He had not seen any TOP for that period. He was prepared to amend his\n\nvaluation of $28,000 if there was such a TOP but did not say what he would amend it to (NE 91 line 5\n\nto 7).308.    Item 11 was covered under Vegolds quotation at AB 25 dated 10 June\n\n1999. Vegold had quoted $57,000 but in my view this was not on a success basis.309.    Vegold had given the impression in its quotation that an architect and an\n\nM&E engineer had to be engaged to submit documents to the relevant authorities.310.    The main evidence in favour of Vegold was based on an inference that it\n\nmust have done something to obtain TOP on or before 1 January 2000 as Mr Ng managed to get a hotel\n\nlicence issued on 1 January 2000.311.    However there was no evidence of the submission of substantive documents\n\nto the relevant authorities by the architect or the M&E engineer supposedly engaged by Vegold.312.    The Defendants produced some documents in Exhibit D2 but they did not show\n\nmuch. In Exhibit D2, there is a copy of an invoice dated 28 December 1999 to M/s Vago Pte Ltd\n\nfrom TKS Building Services for $3,000 for submission of amendment plans to various authorities.313.    In Exhibit D2 p 5, there is a copy of a cheque for $3,000 in favour of TKS\n\nBuilding Services.314.    There were also some other documents which were supposed to show claims or\n\npayments of amounts regarding architectural services (see Exhibit D2 p 3, 4, 7).315.    However the figures in these documents, even if accepted at face value,\n\ndid not add up to $28,000 which Mr Cheong had recommended for payment on behalf of GEH.316.    Neither TKS Building Services nor the architect nor the M&E engineer\n\nwas called to give evidence for Vegold.317.    In the circumstances, even though TOP had been obtained, I am of the view\n\nthat Vegold should be allowed only $28,000 for item 11.Item 12 - To supply and install water tanks and re-do existing pipings318.    Mr Casimir had recommended $20,000 for item 12, instead of the quoted sum\n\nof $40,000, on the basis that the work for this item was not completed.319.    He was of the view that one water tank on the roof was old and the other\n\nwas relatively new.320.    Some pipes had been changed, but not all, as indicated in the different\n\ncolours of the pipes, the ones in darker blue being relatively new.321.    However he had no personal knowledge that the work had been done by\n\nVegold.322.    Mr Ng produced a copy of a letter from Leo & Leo Plumbing Service for\n\n$4,500 in Exhibit D2 p 12 but the job was not in relation to item 12.323.    Mr Cheong did not recommend any payment for item 12. However, in his Table\n\n1, he did not say that the work was not done by Vegold but that it was not executed because the tank\n\ninstalled did not meet PUB requirements.324.    Then, in cross-examination, he said he was referring to two water heaters\n\ninstead (NE 92 line 7 to 10).325.    The two water heaters are the subject of a different quotation (AB 22)\n\nfrom that for the water tanks (AB 26). It seems to me that Mr Cheong had mixed up the two.326.    I am of the view that Vegold should be granted $20,000 for item 12.Item 13 - Air-condition system327.    The parties agreed that no quantum should be allowed for item 13.Item 14 - Television antennae328.    Mr Casimir recommended payment of the full $18,000 on the basis that the\n\nwork had been completed.329.    In Closing Submission, GEHs Counsel argued that there was no direct\n\nevidence, such as invoices or receipts, that indicate that the works had been completed by the\n\nDefendants.330.    It was also argued that Brendma, not Vegold, had changed the TV aerial\n\ncables and TV wall point.331.    In my view, it is of no concern to GEH whether the work was done by\n\nBrendma or Vegold itself.332.    Secondly, if Vegold was not to be paid for this item, Mr Cheong would have\n\nstated so in his Table 1.333.    Instead, Mr Cheongs Table 1 commented that the work for this item was\n\ncompleted as reported by Mr Ang K T. He recommended payment of $18,000 also.334.    I allow Vegold $18,000 for item 14.Item 15 - Room power cut-off point335.    Mr Casimir recommended payment of the full $15,000 for this item on the\n\nbasis that the work had been completed.336.    Mr Cheongs Table 1 stated that the work had been completed but was not\n\napproved by Mr Ang as reported by Mr Ang on 2 August 2000. Yet Mr Cheongs Table 1 also noted that\n\nVegolds quotation (at AB 23) had been approved by Mr Ang.337.    In the circumstances, I allow Vegold $15,000 for item 15.Item 16 - To re-patch up the wall paper for the hotel338.    The quantum for this item was agreed at $4,000. However liability was not\n\nadmitted.339.    Since this item is found in Vegolds quotation (AB 23) which Mr Ang had\n\napproved and as quantum is not disputed, I allow Vegold $4,000 for item 16.Item 17 - Remove existing cooling tower, water heater, piping340.    Mr Casimir valued the works at the entire sum claimed of $24,000.341.    Mr Cheongs Table 1 commented that work was completed and he valued the\n\nworks at $24,000 also.342.    I allow Vegold $24,000 for item 17.Item 18 - Install two water heaters and piping system343.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $22,500. The quoted sum was $45,000.344.    He said two water heaters had been installed and about 20% of the piping\n\nwork had been completed (NE 141 line 13 to NE 142 line 8). He attributed $10,000 for each of the two\n\nwater heaters and $5,000 for the 20% of the piping work (NE 142 line 19 to NE 143 line 3).345.    On the other hand, Mr Cheong said he had obtained a quotation of the same\n\nmodel of the water heaters from Rheem (Far East) Pte Ltd dated 25 April 2000. This was Exhibit P1\n\nand quoted the heater at a unit price of $2,360.346.    However, the quotation was not addressed to Mr Cheong but to GEH.347.    Secondly, in Mr Cheongs Table 1, he made the following contradictory\n\ncomments for this item. First, he commented that the two Rheem heaters had been installed but were\n\nnot suitable for use. Then, in the next column, he valued the works at the full sum of $45,000.348.    When this was pointed out to him, he had to ask for some time to review\n\nhis comments. Thereafter, he said that Vegold should be entitled to the full $45,000 (NE 80 line 22\n\nto NE 83 line 20) even though Mr Casimir had valued item 18 at $22,500 only.349.    In his comments, Mr Cheong also mentioned 34 instant water heaters costing\n\n$8,500 for item 18 which confused the matter further.350.    It is clear that Mr Casimirs evidence on this item is to be preferred.\n\nI allow Vegold $22,500 for item 18.Item 19 - Re-wiring for generator and lift351.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $2,200 instead of the quoted amount of\n\n$11,000.352.    Mr Casimir saw some new orange cabling in Mr Cheongs AEIC p 49, photo\n\nNo B3.353.    In Mr Cheongs Table 1, he was of the view that the work had not been\n\ndone at all.354.    In cross-examination at NE 93 line 15 to 19, he accepted that some wiring\n\nwas done, although it was not clear to him whether this was for the generator and lift. He said that\n\nsome work was done but not satisfactorily.355.    I allow Vegold $2,200 for item 19.The Third Renovation Package - continued356.    As for the Third Renovation Package, the quotation at AB 49 and 50 is for\n\n$363,430 excluding GST. In the Mutual Agreement, it was changed inexplicably to $363,930 also\n\nexcluding GST. Paragraph 57 of the Defence and Counterclaim claimed $363,000. There was no\n\nexplanation for these three different sums.357.    In para 86 of Mr Ngs AEIC and according to Mr Casimir, Vegold should be\n\nentitled to $217,380, excluding GST, for work done under the Third Renovation Package.358.    The alleged completed works under the Third Renovation Package were items\n\n20 to 24 of Mr Cheongs and Mr Casimirs reports. I will also deal with them individually.359.    Before I do so, I would mention that, unlike the quotations for the works\n\nunder the Second Renovation Package, the quotation for the works under the Third Renovation Package\n\nat AB 49 and 50 were not accepted by Mr Ang as such.360.    While the total sum of the Third Renovation Package was added to the total\n\nsum of the Second Renovation Package under the Mutual Agreement, it was an estimated sum. Secondly,\n\nit was subject to the qualification that Both party agreed (sic) the final settle (sic) figure of\n\nthe construction cost of $831,790 will be determine (sic) upon physically checking of the items as\n\nstated in the invoice.361.    I read this to mean that as far as the works under the Third Renovation\n\nPackage was concerned, GEH was not bound by the amount stated in the quotation even if the works\n\nwere completed but would be liable for a fair amount.362.    I come now to items 20 to 24.Item 20 (a) - M&E appointment363.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $8,000 instead of the quoted amount of\n\n$10,000 on the basis that the work was partially completed.364.    In cross-examination, he said that although CSC had not been obtained yet,\n\nrelated installations had been installed and these would have required the services of an engineer.\n\nHe did not know how much Vegold paid to the M&E engineer for his appointment.365.    Mr Ng said Gilbert Choo, from M.E.E Consulting Engineers Pte Ltd (M.E.E.)\n\nwas the M&E engineer but the works were not completed because of Mr Choo and Mr Ang.366.    In his Counsels affidavit to join M.E.E. as a Third Party in the\n\naction, it was alleged that Vegolds failure to complete all rectification works was caused and/or\n\ncontributed to by the failure of Gilbert Choo to submit amended working plans to the relevant\n\nauthorities for their approval.367.    In cross-examination, Mr Ng blamed both Gilbert Choo and Mr Ang for this\n\nas he claimed that Gilbert Choo had informed him of Mr Angs refusal to sign documents (NE 224\n\nline 3 to NE 225 line 12).368.    Mr Ng gave various reasons for not calling Gilbert Choo as a witness.\n\nFirst, he said he was under the impression that GEH would call the professionals as witnesses. He\n\nthen said it was because Gilbert Choo had been engaged by Mr Ang in August 2000 and agreed that that\n\nwas the only reason why he did not call Gilbert Choo as a witness (NE 225 line 14 to NE 26 line 6).369.    Mr Cheong gave no value for this item. He was not aware that Mr Gilbert\n\nChoo had been appointed.370.    It seems to me that this item is an overlap with item 11 which includes\n\nthe appointment of an M&E engineer.371.    There was no elaboration on item 20(a) and it was unclear to me how much\n\nwork Gilbert Choo had done or how much he had charged Vegold. The so-called evidence in Exhibit D2\n\nhas already been taken into account for item 11.372.    In the circumstances, I disallow the claim for item 20(a).Item 20(b) - RI appointment373.    RI means registered inspectors.374.    The parties agreed the quantum for this item at $2,000 but not on\n\nliability. This item was in the quotation for the Third Renovation Package and the total cost for\n\nthat package was stated in the Mutual Agreement. However, there was no evidence to support the\n\nallegation that RIs had in fact been appointed.375.    I disallow the claim for item 20(b).Item 20(c)(i) - Pressurised fan for staircase376.    As Mr Casimir acknowledged that this was not done, this claim is\n\ndisallowed.Item 20(c)(ii) - Pressurised fan for corridor377.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $8,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $12,000 on the basis that the work was partially completed.378.    Strangely enough, Mr Cheong valued this item at $12,000 on the basis that\n\nthe work was completed.379.    I allow Vegold $8,000 for item 20(c)(ii).Item 20(c)(iii) - Pressurised fan for Smoke Free Lobby380.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $10,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $16,500 for work partially completed.381.    Again, strangely, Mr Cheong valued this item at the full quoted cost on\n\nthe basis that the work was completed.382.    I allow Vegold $10,000 for item 20(c)(iii).Item 20(d) - Construction of Smoke Free Lobbies383.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $20,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $30,000 on the basis that the works were partially completed.384.    Mr Cheong valued this item at $16,5000 also on the basis of partial\n\ncompletion.385.    I find that, as compared with Mr Cheong, Mr Casimir was more reliable.386.    I allow Vegold $20,000 for item 20(d).Item 20(e) - Construction of half an hour fire rated doors for corridors from fourth to seventh\n\nfloors387.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $12,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $16,000 on the basis of partial completion.388.    Mr Cheong valued this item at $4,000. His comment in his report was, Doors\n\nwere poorly installed and does not comply with authorities regulations. There were no provision of\n\nvision panels and door closers. At the junction of the door frame (i.e jamb) and window frame (i.e\n\nmullion) there were gaps that will allow smoke/fire to spread from one compartment to another.389.    However in cross-examination, he accepted that the requirement of door\n\nvision panels was based on his own opinion and was not a requirement of building regulations.390.    He also did not produce any regulation requiring door closers.391.    If the doors did not comply with the relevant requirements and had to be\n\nreplaced, then, Vegold should not be allowed any sum for them. Yet, Mr Cheong was prepared to give a\n\nvaluation of $4,000.392.    GEHs other witness for this item was Ko Peng Chon (PW5). He is the\n\nsole-proprietor of Guan Wei Contractor who had been engaged by GEH to, inter alia, install\n\nfire-resistant doors in or about December 2000. His invoice is dated 29 March 2001. The work was\n\ndone by his sub-contractor.393.    He pointed out a few doors shown in photos of Mr Casimir which were not up\n\nto full ceiling height. Better photos on this item are found in the report of Mr Cheong. However it\n\nwas not suggested that the gap could not be closed or filled up.394.    As for gaps between the junction of the door frame and window frame, Mr Ko\n\ndid not say there was any and my attention was not drawn to any photo to illustrate such gaps.395.    Mr Ko said he had to replace doors according to drawings of an architect\n\nbut he did not specify the locations of the doors replaced. Neither were the drawings produced nor\n\ndid the architect give evidence.396.    Item 1 of Guan Wei Contractors invoice showed installation of four sets\n\nof fire- resistant doors at fourth to seventh floors but no dismantling of existing fire-resistant\n\ndoors on those floors.397.    Item 2 of the invoice refers to the dismantling of four sets of swing\n\ndoors and installation of four sets of fire-resistant doors but it was not clear whether this\n\npertained to fire-resistant doors installed by Vegold on the fourth to seventh floors or not.398.    I was of the view that GEH had not established that the doors replaced by\n\nMr Kos sub-contractor were those installed by Vegold.399.    However, I note from the invoice that Guan Wei Contractors charges were\n\n$1,650 per set of fire-resistant door whereas Vegolds was $4,000 per set (see AB 49). In my view,\n\nVegold was trying to over-charge GEH. I will allow Vegold $6,000 for item 20(e).Item 20(f) - Changing tempered glass door at 3rdfloor to half an hour fire\n\nrated door400.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $4,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $5,000 as the materials were on site.401.    Mr Kos evidence was not specifically on this item.402.    Mr Cheong gave no value for this item although his comment in Table 1 was\n\nthat the door was supplied but not installed, and Ms Kee had valued it at $500.403.    In cross-examination, Mr Cheong admitted that he should himself have\n\nattributed a value and he suggested $500. He said he based this on Ms Kees assessment (NE 94 line\n\n8 to line 22) but Ms Kee did not give any evidence.404.    Vegolds Counsel suggested that the value should be $3,333 on the basis\n\nthat the material costs would be two-third of $5,000 but Mr Cheong disagreed.405.    I note that the $3,333 suggested by Vegolds Counsel was even lower than\n\nMr Casimirs valuation of $4,000. Secondly, I do not see why the half hour rated fire door for the\n\nthird floor should cost more than the unit cost of $4,000 for the same item for the other floors.\n\nThe removal of the glass door should not cost $1,000. Thirdly, even the unit cost of $4,000 is\n\nexcessive as I have already said in respect of item 20(e).406.    Bearing in mind that the work was not completed, I allow Vegold $1,300 for\n\nitem 20(f).Item 20(g) - Construction of pressurised air-duct from rooftop to 2ndfloor, 4thto 7thfloor corridor407.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $80,000 instead of the original quoted sum\n\nof $120,000 on the basis that the work was partly completed.408.    Mr Cheong valued this item at $40,000 also on the basis of partly\n\ncompleted work.409.    However PW7 Mr Lee Nang Hoe gave evidence for GEH. He was the owner of Air\n\nDuct Metal works. In para 7 of his AEIC, he said that the photos of ducting work, featured in Mr\n\nCasimirs report, were of work carried out by him. Mr Lee was not challenged on this aspect of his\n\nevidence.410.    Indeed, during cross-examination, Vegolds Counsel suggested that Vegold\n\nhad done the coring of the holes for the ducts, but not the ducting itself. He suggested that the\n\ncoring work was more laborious. However, Mr Lee disagreed that coring work was laborious work.411.    I am of the view that Mr Casimir had wrongly assumed that the work he saw\n\nwas all done by Vegold.412.    I allow Vegold $40,000 for item 20(g).Items 20(h), (i) and (j)413.    The parties have agreed that the quantum for each of items 20(h), (i) and\n\n(j) is Nil.Item 20(k) - To construct fire exit at 2ndfloor as per drawings414.    The parties have agreed that the quantum for this item is $3,000 but did\n\nnot agree on liability.415.    Mr Cheong had valued this item at nil but his comment in his Table 1 was\n\nthat the work was not completed. This suggests it was partially done.416.    I allow Vegold $3,000 for item 20(k).Item 21(a) - Construction of three mechanical car park barriers417.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $65,000 instead of the sum of $105,000\n\nquoted by Vegold on the basis that materials were on site but the work was not completed.418.    Mr Cheongs report commented that the mechanisms had been supplied but\n\nnot installed. He valued this item at $20,000 but he did not ask Ms Kee to value it.419.    I note that AB 174 and 175 was a revised quotation for three units for a\n\nmechanical car parking system from Norva (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd dated 6 June 2000. It was addressed to\n\nEastern Park Hotel for the attention of Mr Ang. The quotation was for a total of $52,000 (excluding\n\nGST).420.    However, no one from Norva (S.E.A.) Pte Ltd gave evidence for GEH. Neither\n\ndid any of the Counsel refer to it in cross-examination.421.    The burden is on Vegold to establish its claim and I am not satisfied that\n\nthe sum quoted by Vegold for this item was fair.422.    Also it would have been a simple matter for Mr Ng to obtain a quotation\n\nfrom another supplier and get that supplier to give evidence. He did not.423.    Neither did GEH.424.    I allow Vegold $35,000 for item 21(a).Item 21(b) - To paint three parking lots in front of the building425.    This item was agreed at $100 on quantum but there was no agreement on\n\nliability.426.    Mr Casimirs report was that this work was partly complete whereas Mr\n\nCheongs report was that the works have not been executed.427.    I prefer Mr Casimirs evidence on this and I allow Vegold $100 for item\n\n21(b).Item 22428.    This was agreed to be valued at Nil.Item 23 - To clean the CBPU for CSC429.    Mr Casimir valued this item at $2,500 out of the original quotation of\n\n$5,000 on the basis of partial completion.430.    In cross-examination, Mr Ng referred to a quotation from Leo & Leo\n\nPlumbing Service at Exhibit D2 p 12 as applying also to item 23.431.    The quotation was for $4,500 to do the following works:(a) To obtain CSC from Sew (Dept) CBPU(b) To turn on water supply(c) To alter PUB water meter position.432.    Mr Ng claimed that he did engage Leo & Leo Plumbing Service and paid\n\n$2,000. However, he did not produce any other evidence of the engagement or the payment.433.    As for Mr Cheong, his report at his AEIC p 37C did not indicate what he\n\nthought of this item beyond a comment of (No approval from Mr Ang KT).434.    It seems to me that this item overlaps with one of Vegolds quotations\n\nat AB 25 under the Second Renovation Package whereby Vegold had quoted $57,000 to obtain TOP and\n\nCSC.435.    Even if item 23 is a separate item, there is insufficient evidence to\n\npersuade me that Leo & Leo Plumbing Service had been engaged by Vegold for the item.436.    I disallow the claim for item 23.Item 24 - To do turfing for the car park437.    The parties agreed quantum for this item at $800 but did not agree on\n\nliability.438.    Mr Casimirs report stated that the work for this item had been\n\ncompleted.439.    Mr Cheongs Table 1 stated that the work had not been executed. However\n\nin the column for comments, he made adverse comments about the work. In yet another column, he then\n\nvalued the work done at $1,280 although he attributed another $1,380 to reconstruct the work.440.    I prefer Mr Casimirs evidence on this and allow Vegold $800 for item\n\n24.Item 25 - To supply M&E for turn on of power supply for health centre441.    The basis for claiming item 25 is not pleaded although it is mentioned in\n\nMr Ngs AEIC paras 25 and 28. This item should also have been claimed under the First Tenancy\n\nAgreement instead.442.    GEHs position is that under clause 4(4) of the First Tenancy Agreement,\n\nit is not responsible for turning on fees. Mr Ng disagreed because his position is that he is not\n\nbound by that agreement (NE 171 line 5 to 8).443.    I have found that he is bound by it.444.    The claim for item 25 is disallowed.Item 26 - Still plate for car park and drawing of six parking lots445.    The basis for claiming item 26 is not pleaded nor is it mentioned in Mr Ngs\n\nAEIC. It is mentioned only in an invoice from Vegold at AB 20.446.    I disallow the claim for this item.Item 27 - Supply of full equipment for hotel rooms447.    Likewise, the basis for claiming item 27 is not pleaded nor is it\n\nmentioned in Mr Ngs AEIC. It was mentioned only in an invoice (without letterhead) at AB 50.448.    I disallow the claim for this item.Item 28 - Supply of manpower for removing furniture and fittings from rooms in a hotel at MacPherson\n\nRoad449.    The basis for claiming item 28 is not pleaded.450.    In para 92 of his AEIC, Mr Ng claimed that Mr Ang had told him that his\n\nhotel at MacPherson Road (Great Eastern Hotel) had been sold to Ho Bee Development Limited. Mr Ang\n\nhad proposed that Mr Ng salvage whatever furniture and fittings he wanted from that hotel and orally\n\nassured him that the labour and transportation costs would be borne by GEH.451.    Mr Ng also exhibited correspondence from the Receivers & Managers of\n\nGEH (at that time such Receivers & Managers had been appointed). However one of the letters\n\ndated 12 October 1999 stated clearly:We also understand from the directors that all costs incurred for the\n\n  removal of items from GEHPL to 165 Kitchener Road is at your own expense.452.    I disallow the claim for this item.Item 29 - Supply and re-installation of tel-cable for all hotel rooms453.    The quantum for this item was agreed at $2,000 but liability was not\n\nagreed.454.    The basis for claiming item 29 is not pleaded. Neither is it mentioned in\n\nMr Ngs AEIC. It was mentioned only in an invoice (without letterhead) at AB 150.455.    I disallow the claim for this item.Items 30 to 47456.    I have dealt with items 30 to 47 in paras 151 to 196 above.Summary457.    The total of the sums allowed under the Second and the Third Renovation\n\nPackages for work done is $257,900 excluding GST. With GST it is $265,637.Counterclaim by Vegold for being denied the opportunity to complete the Second and Third Renovation\n\nPackages (para 34(a) and part of para 58(a) of the Defence and Counterclaim)458.    .    Vegold is claiming for loss of profits under the\n\nSecond and Third Renovation Packages for being denied the opportunity to complete the works under\n\nthese packages.459.    For this, Vegold is claiming 20% of $831,730, which was supposed to be the\n\ntotal of the Second and Third Renovation Packages if Vegold had completed all the works. This works\n\nout to $166,346.460.    This approach assumes that all the work was not done which is not true.461.    Vegold has already claimed for various items supposedly done and the\n\nprofit element is already included in the claim for those items.462.    The fact that Vegold claimed 20% of the total without taking into account\n\nits claim for work done is illustrative of the way in which Mr Ng and his Counsel had presented the\n\nmany claims on behalf of the Defendants.463.    It was also submitted for Vegold that Mr Ang had frustrated the\n\nperformance of the Second and Third Renovation Packages.464.    First, Mr Ang was alleged to have refused to sign plans for submission\n\n(para 77 of Defendants Closing Submission) but there was insufficient evidence to establish this.465.    Secondly, it was also submitted for Vegold that Mr Ang had deprived it of\n\nthe services of Gilbert Choo by instigating Mr Choo to stop rendering professional service to Vegold\n\nand engaging Mr Choo directly (see para 78 of Defendants Closing Submission). In my view, there\n\nwas insufficient evidence to establish this.466.    It was also submitted for Vegold that GEH had wrongfully repudiated the\n\ncontract for the Second and Third Renovation Packages by its failure to give Vegold prior notice and\n\nreasons for terminating the same (see paras 80 to 86 of Defendants Closing Submission). However,\n\nthe evidence does not support this submission.467.    For example, at one point in time, Vegold had sent a letter dated 27 April\n\n2000 to GEHs Mr Ang (see Mr Ngs AEIC p 233). In the letter, Vegold complained that because\n\nVegold had not received any deposits or payment for invoices allegedly handed personally to Mr Ang,\n\nVegold would stop work till payment was received. However, this letter ignored the Mutual Agreement\n\nunder which the parties had agreed to set-off $720,000 of the cost of the Second and Third\n\nRenovation Packages against the rent payable by Brendma.468.    Also, as at 27 April 2000, the works done by Vegold had not cost $720,000.469.    In another letter dated 5 May 2000 from Vegold to GEH (see AB 131), Vegold\n\ngave a different excuse. It said that since March 2000, the project had come to a standstill because\n\nof constant interruption caused by Mr Angs disruption in bringing in third-party contractors.\n\nThis letter ignored the fact that Brendma had been writing several letters to GEH to complain about\n\ndefects.470.    I also note from correspondence that, at times, when such third-party\n\ncontractors wanted to gain access, Brendma claimed that the hotel guests safety and comfort were\n\nbeing compromised.471.    At one point of time, Brendma also wanted to claim compensation for loss\n\nof use of hotel rooms, thus obstructing GEH in carrying out works.472.    The correspondence from Brendmas solicitors (see AB 226 and 227, 236\n\nand 237) also demonstrated that at one time Brendma was seeking an indemnity from GEH in case Vegold\n\nshould make a claim against Brendma in respect of the renovation works even though Vegolds\n\ncontract was with GEH and not with Brendma. Furthermore, Vegold and Brendma were controlled by Mr\n\nNg.473.    After considering all the evidence, I do not accept that Vegold was denied\n\nthe opportunity to complete the works. It had been dragging its feet while at the same time Brendma,\n\nwhich was also controlled by Mr Ng, was complaining about various defects in the hotel at the\n\nProperty.474.    There was also no evidence to substantiate that 20% was Vegolds profit\n\nelement.475.    I disallow this claim.Claim by Vegold for submission of relevant amended drawings (para 34(b) and part of para 58(a) of\n\nDefence and Counterclaim)476.    Vegold is claiming $200,000 for loss suffered in respect of submission of\n\none set of amended drawings.477.    In his AEIC at para 88, Mr Ng did not elaborate on this particular claim\n\nexcept to refer to a letter from Vegold dated 14 January 2000 to GEH.478.    The letter states:RE: CONFIRMATION FOR APPLICATION OF CSC FOR 165 KITCHENER ROAD SINGAPORE\n\n  208532Dear Sir,With reference to the above, you have agreed and spend for the above project at\n\n  the amount of Singapore Dollars Eight Hundred Thirty One Thousand Only (S$831,000.00). This amount\n\n  does not include any plan application/submission/amendment of requirements from BCA, FSB, LTA,\n\n  MOE, which is estimated at Singapore Dollars Two Hundred Fifty Thousand (S$250,000.00).479.    However, Mr Ngs AEIC at para 88 was still claiming $200,000 without any\n\nexplanation for the difference in the sums.480.    Then, para 131 of the Defendants Closing Submission argues that GEH\n\nand/or Mr Ang was liable to pay the $250,000 mentioned in the said letter and because Mr Ang had\n\nfrustrated the contract in respect of the Second and Third Renovation Packages, Vegold was entitled\n\nto claim $50,000 being 20% of loss of profit on the $250,000.481.    As is evident, this $50,000 is a different sum from the $200,000\n\noriginally claimed.482.    Secondly, I did not agree that there should be an additional $250,000\n\nquotation.483.    This is because Vegold had previously given a quotation for $57,000 (see\n\nAB 25 dated 10 June 1999) for the engagement of an architect and an M&E engineer to submit\n\ndocuments to obtain TOP and CSC. Mr Ang had accepted that quotation.484.    The letter dated 14 January 2000 was, in my view, an attempt to\n\ndouble-charge GEH and to inflate Vegolds charges.485.    In any event, there is no other evidence to substantiate that the sum of\n\n$250,000 was a fair sum for submission of documents or that 20% was the correct or fair percentage\n\nfor Vegolds profit for this work.486.    Accordingly, I disallow this claim.OVERALL SUMMARY487.    Although Vegold is entitled to $265,637 under the Second and Third\n\nRenovation Packages (see para 457 above), Vegold is not entitled to judgment for any sum in view of\n\nthe agreement to set-off $20,000 a month against rent payable by Brendma under the Third Tenancy\n\nAgreement and the Mutual Agreement, both of which have still not been terminated.488.    On the other hand, GEH is entitled to payment of the balance of the rent\n\nfrom 15 January 2000 to 14 June 2000 i.e $141,000 (see para 243 above).489.    However, GEHs Counsel sought to persuade me that the corporate veil\n\nshould be lifted and judgment be entered against Mr Ng personally as well.490.    On the one hand, it is true that the arrangements to set-off various rent\n\npayable by Mr Ng initially and later by Brendma, under the Third Tenancy Agreement and Mutual\n\nAgreement, against Vegolds works arose only because Mr Ng controls Vegold as well.491.    However, I do not agree that Mr Ng was using Brendma to avoid Vegolds\n\nobligations to carry out the works under the various Renovation Packages.492.    I also do not agree that Vegold and Brendma are a sham and faade for Mr\n\nNgs businesses.493.    GEHs Counsel also referred to the following evidence from Mr Ng at NE\n\n236 line 11 to 13:Q The reason for that is because in Mr Angs dealings with you, you are\n\n  the true contracting party for Brendma and Vegold?A Yes. He knew that these 2 companies belong to me.494.    However I am of the view that Mr Ng understood the question to mean that\n\nhe was contracting for Brendma and Vegold and not that he was personally liable for their contracts.\n\nIndeed, in the next question, he emphatically denied that he was the actual contracting party, see\n\nNE 236 line 15 to 19:Q Put: When the 3rdDefendants entered into the 3rdtenancy agreement, the actual contracting party was you.A Disagree. Government should not allow a private limited company to be\n\n  registered if someone signs under such a name can be still construed as the true contracting\n\n  party.495.    I am of the view that Mr Ng is entitled to use corporate vehicles to carry\n\nout different businesses just like Mr Ang or anyone else. If, by using such corporate vehicles, he\n\nenjoys limited liability, that is what the law allows. Should Mr Ng be personally liable for Brendmas\n\nliabilities then Mr Ang should likewise be personally liable for GEHs liabilities, if any. Yet,\n\nCounsel for Mr Ang, who also act for GEH, was denying that Mr Ang had any personal liability.496.    It was clear to Mr Ang that Mr Ng was using his corporate vehicle Brendma\n\nfor the tenancy of the hotel and the health centre. Mr Ang accepted this and hence the parties to\n\nthe Third Tenancy Agreement were GEH and Brendma. Although the Mutual Agreement is between Mr Ng and\n\nMr Ang, it was entered into on behalf of their respective corporate vehicles.497.    Secondly, the liability to pay rent is found primarily in the Third\n\nTenancy Agreement.498.    Thirdly, under the Mutual Agreement, the monthly rent is referred to as\n\nbeing for Brendma and Brendma will be paying $37,000 as monthly rental to Great Eastern\n\nHotel Pte Ltd .499.    I have lifted the corporate veil to the limited extent mentioned above eg\n\nsee paras 220, 221 and 286 but I do not think it should be lifted any further.500.    Accordingly, I grant judgment in favour of GEH against only Brendma for\n\n$141,000 with interest at 10% per annum from 14 June 2000 to the date of full payment.501.    GEHs claim for an account and inquiry and, alternatively, for damages\n\nis dismissed.502.    All counterclaims by the Defendants are dismissed.503.    All claims by any of the Defendants against Mr Ang personally are also\n\ndismissed.504.    I will hear the parties on costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
