        "The background facts": "",
        "(a)   The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                Accused": "2       The accused, Astro Bin Jakaria (FIN No\n                    G8098952R) (“the Accused”), is an East Malaysian who first came to\n                    Singapore on August 2007. He first met the deceased, Abdul Khalid Bin Othman\n                    (NRIC No S2148066E) (“the Deceased”), sometime in September 2007\n                    while working as a cleaner for Sengent Company. The Accused referred to the\n                    Deceased as “Kak Mie” and knew that the Deceased was a\n                    transvestite. In the course of the following one month, their relationship\n                    developed rapidly and they became closer. 3       In October 2007, due to poor job performance,\n                    Sengent Company terminated the Accused’s employment. The Accused requested\n                    for the Deceased’s assistance as he no longer had a place to stay. This\n                    led to the Deceased inviting the Accused to stay with him at his flat.\n                    Thereafter, the Accused resided at the Deceased’s flat until he left for\n                    Malaysia on 6 November 2007. 4       The Accused returned to Singapore on several\n                    occasions and on each visit, he stayed at the Deceased’s flat until his\n                    return to Malaysia. The Accused’s passport (D4) showed that he had entered\n                    Singapore on 14December 2007 and exited on\n                    19 December 2007. He re-entered Singapore on 24 December 2007 and left\n                    on 29 December 2007. 5       On 9 January 2008, the Accused again\n                    returned to Singapore and visited the Deceased at his flat. The Deceased\n                    recommended a factory job in Tampines which was taken up by the Accused.\n                    Afterwhich, the Accused stayed at the company’s accommodation until he\n                    left Singapore on 24 February 2008. This was the only period of time the\n                    Accused was employed in Singapore after his termination by Sengent\n                    Company. 6       For the duration of each stay in Singapore, the\n                    Accused had never contributed to the rent of the Deceased’s flat. In other\n                    words, the Deceased provided free lodging to the Accused whenever the latter was\n                    in Singapore. 7       It was evident that the Deceased was deeply\n                    caring towards the Accused. Apart from providing him with shelter, the\n                    Deceased’s generosity extended to buying him new clothes, cooking him\n                    meals and giving him money when he was short of it (and this was usually the\n                    case given the Accused’s unemployment). 8       The Deceased lived in a one bedroom HDB flat.\n                    His flatmates, one Taher Bin Ahmad and one Kak Timah, slept in the living\n                    room/hall of the flat. The Accused slept in the Deceased’s bedroom and\n                    shared the same bed with the Deceased during his stay. 9       It was the Accused’s evidence that from\n                    the first night he started sharing the bed with the Deceased, the latter would\n                    touch and caress him to arouse his sexual desires. The Accused, prior to\n                    19 June 2008, had always warded off his sexual advances.",
        "(b)   Events leading up to the scuffle between the Deceased and\n                the Accused on 19 June 2008": "10     The Accused returned to Singapore again on\n                    Sunday 15 June 2008 and stayed at the Deceased’s flat. 11     At about 6 pm on 19 June 2008, the\n                    Accused met the Deceased at the latter’s workplace at the SMRT Clubhouse.\n                    The Accused was told to wait until the Deceased was done with work. While\n                    waiting in the store room, the Accused drank one whole bottle of Royal Stout and\n                    one third of a bottle of Carlsberg. 12     At about 8.26 pm, the Deceased and the\n                    Accused left for the Deceased’s flat. They reached the flat at about 9\n                    p.m., after which, the Deceased gave the Accused $20 to buy some drinks. The\n                    Accused then proceeded to a nearby coffee shop and bought a bottle of Carlsberg\n                    (P234) and a bottle of Guinness Stout (P235). 13     The Accused returned to the flat at about\n                    9.05 pm to 9.10 pm. When he reached the flat, he saw the Deceased clad\n                    in a red towel and was applying lotion to his thighs and hands. The Accused then\n                    placed the drinks he purchased aside and sat on the bed. 14     The Deceased got up and sat next to the\n                    Accused. He started to caress the Accused’s hands and thighs and attempted\n                    to touch his penis. The Accused pushed the Deceased’s hand away and told\n                    him ‘Nanti’, which means\n                    ‘wait’ in Malay. 15     The Accused then requested for a bottle opener\n                    and a glass on two separate occasions. The Deceased obliged and went back and\n                    forth twice to get the requested items from the kitchen. After opening and\n                    pouring his drink into the glass, the Accused placed the glass on the floor and\n                    then removed his T-shirt as he felt warm. 16     The Deceased left the room again and brought\n                    back a bottle of Drambuie (a type of whisky liquor) (P236). The Accused declined\n                    the Deceased’s offer to have the liquor as it was too strong for him. The\n                    Deceased then took a sip of the said liquor and sat beside the Accused. The\n                    Accused drank the whole bottle of Guinness Stout (P235). 17     The Accused then put on a concert CD into the\n                    VCD player. The Deceased, within a few minutes, changed the concert CD to a\n                    “blue” VCD which showed man-on-man pornography and proceeded to\n                    fondle the Accused. He removed the Accused’s jeans, pulled down his boxers\n                    and started performing fellatio on the Accused. All the while, the Accused lay\n                    on his back and imagined that it was a woman who was performing fellatio on him.\n                    He became sexually aroused and sustained an erection. 18     The Deceased then stopped. The Accused then\n                    realised that the Deceased was sitting next to him. When the Accused asked\n                    “Why?”, the Deceased propositioned to him and said, “Come\n                    play my backside”. The Accused flatly declined, saying, “I\n                    don’t want, I’m not used to this” and pulled up his boxers.\n                    He then went to take his pair of jeans that was hung behind the bedroom\n                    door. 19     The Deceased tried to cajole the Accused. He\n                    also mentioned that he had given the Accused what he wanted and provided him\n                    with lodging. As he started caressing the Accused, the Accused pushed him and he\n                    fell backwards into the cupboard and let out a scream. As the Deceased tried to\n                    stand up, the Accused saw the Deceased gripping something in his hand and was\n                    looking angrily at him. 20     The Accused then punched the Deceased’s\n                    face. The Deceased fell again and covered his face with his hand while mumbling\n                    something and trying to stand up. The Accused pounced on him again and gripped\n                    the Deceased from the back of his neck. The Deceased’s head was positioned\n                    under the Accused’s right armpit and the Deceased was then pushed onto the\n                    bed. 21     The Accused went up on to the bed, held the\n                    Deceased’s right shoulder, crossed over the Deceased’s body and\n                    positioned himself to the right side of the Deceased. He gripped the\n                    Deceased’s neck using his left arm and punched the Deceased again. His\n                    grip was released as the Deceased was struggling. The Deceased then used his\n                    right elbow to strike the Accused’s chest region while struggling at the\n                    same time. The Accused fell backwards and tried to grab hold of the Deceased.\n                    The Deceased scratched the Accused’s left cheek, left arm and left\n                    hand. 22     The Accused then punched the Deceased’s\n                    chest. The Deceased fell backwards onto the mattress. He tried to sit up and the\n                    Accused pushed the Deceased again causing him to fall on the floor beside the\n                    bed with one foot on the bed. The Deceased groaned in pain. 23     During the course of the scuffle, the Deceased\n                    let out a shriek which alerted his neighbours, one Madam Sua Joo Eng (PW13) and\n                    one Madam Sarah Binte Aman (PW21). The Deceased’s denture was also\n                    dislodged from his mouth at some point of the scuffle. The Accused, in his\n                    attempt to prevent the Deceased from calling the police, grabbed a long-sleeved\n                    brown striped T-shirt and tied up the Deceased. The details of how this was done\n                    and how it caused the Deceased’s death will be dealt with\n                below.",
        "(c)   Sequence of events after the Deceased was tied up by the\n                Accused": "24     After tying up and immobilising the Deceased,\n                    the Accused removed the Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) from his wrist,\n                    took his own jacket (P243), and placed it into a black sling bag (P242). He then\n                    gathered the clutter of clothes that had been strewn on the floor in the course\n                    of the scuffle and hurriedly placed them into the wardrobe. While doing so, the\n                    Accused found a gold chain (P162) belonging to the Deceased and took it. He also\n                    appropriated the Deceased’s handphone (P146). 25     As the Accused exited the bedroom, he switched\n                    off the lights and locked the bedroom door by pressing the lock and shutting the\n                    door behind him. He later hailed a cab and went to Geylang. There, he checked\n                    into Hotel 12 Pte Ltd under the name of one Lawrence Anak Nyuak and stayed there\n                    from 19June 2008 until the time of his arrest.\n                    All the while, the Accused had his passport in his possession.",
        "(d)   Events leading up to the discovery of Deceased’s\n                body": "26     After being told by the Deceased’s\n                    flatmate Taher Bin Ahmad (“Taher”) (PW26) that the Deceased was\n                    not seen inside the flat since 19 June 2008 and being informed by the\n                    Deceased’s sister, one Norita Binte Abdul Latiff that the Deceased was not\n                    contactable on 20 June 2008, the Deceased’s adopted daughter, Aini\n                    Binte Karim (“Aini”) (PW29) made several attempts to contact the\n                    Deceased by calling his mobile phone and residential number. 27     On 21 June 2008 at around 2 pm, Aini\n                    decided to lodge a missing person report with the police. Her boyfriend, Ishak\n                    Bin Mohamed (“Ishak”) (PW24) however suggested that they should\n                    first inspect the Deceased’s flat before lodging the report. 28     At about 5.45 pm, Aini and Ishak arrived\n                    at the Deceased’s flat and let themselves in using Taher’s keys. As\n                    Taher had earlier informed them that he did not have the keys to the\n                    Deceased’s bedroom door, they brought along with them two screwdrivers.\n                    Ishak then unsuccessfully tried to pry open the Deceased’s bedroom door\n                    using the two screwdrivers, a chopper and a pair of scissors which were found in\n                    the Deceased’s kitchen. After his failed attempts, he decided to force his\n                    way in by kicking down the bedroom door. 29     Upon entering the bedroom, Aini switched on\n                    the lights. Ishak spotted a blue bag (P233) on the floor. He placed it on the\n                    bed and checked the contents of the said bag. The bag contained a silver metal\n                    box (P231), a black box (P232) with a ‘Heineken’ watch inside and\n                    some male garments. 30     Aini, on the other hand, opened the\n                    Deceased’s wardrobe and found that it was in a state of disarray. This was\n                    unusual as the Deceased’s clothing were normally hung neatly inside the\n                    wardrobe. The metal rod which was used to hang the Deceased’s clothing had\n                    fallen off and a pile of clothing was cluttered up at the base of the\n                    wardrobe. 31     Aini then looked around the Deceased’s\n                    bedroom and caught a glimpse of a portion of hair on the floor next to the bed.\n                    She immediately pointed it out to Ishak and asked if that was the Deceased. Aini\n                    became hysterical and Ishak quickly brought her to the corridor to calm her\n                    down. 32     Ishak then returned to the Deceased’s\n                    bedroom. He removed a red blanket (P199) and a small yellow cushion (P200) and\n                    found a human body lying face-down. Ishak placed the items he had removed back\n                    to their respective positions and swiftly exited the Deceased’s bedroom.\n                    He called the police at about 6.15 pm. 33     Staff Sergeant Mohammad Ridzwan Bin Taib\n                    (“SSgt Ridzwan”) (PW12) and Corporal Ryan Lim Chong Jen\n                    (“Cpl Lim”) (PW15) were dispatched to the Deceased’s flat.\n                    Ishak led SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim to the Deceased’s bedroom. Ishak\n                    removed the same items, which he had removed earlier, that were on top of the\n                    body. SSgt Ridzwan and Cpl Lim then saw a body, clad in a brassiere, lying\n                    motionless in a prone position. They observed that both of the Deceased’s\n                    hands were tied to his back with a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt. Ishak\n                    then replaced the items in the same order as he had found them. 34     As foul play was suspected, SSgt Ridzwan\n                    instructed Ishak and Cpl Lim to leave the flat to prevent the contamination of\n                    the scene. He then contacted duty Senior Investigation Officer, Station\n                    Inspector Goh Tia Eng (PW17) and informed him of their findings. The scene was\n                    immediately cordoned off. 35     Sergeant Mohamed Nasir Bin Mohaideen Arabi\n                    Noordin (“Sgt Nasir”) (PW16), a paramedic, arrived at the\n                    Deceased’s flat at about 6.25 pm. As a long-sleeved brown striped\n                    T-shirt was tied around the circumference of the Deceased’s neck, Sgt\n                    Nasir was unable to take the carotid pulse and had to look for an arterial pulse\n                    from the Deceased’s hands instead. Sgt Nasir removed some of the materials\n                    covering the Deceased’s lower body which exposed the Deceased’s\n                    hands, bound together by the said T-shirt, and took the Deceased’s pulse.\n                    No pulse was detected and the Deceased was pronounced dead at\n                    6.30 pm. 36     At about 10 pm, Associate Professor\n                    Gilbert Lau (“A/P Gilbert Lau”), (PW25) a Senior Consultant\n                    Forensic Pathologist attached to the Centre for Forensic Medicine, Health\n                    Sciences Authority (“HSA”), arrived at the flat and proceeded to\n                    examine the scene. At about 11.05 pm, he conducted an external examination\n                    of the Deceased’s body at the scene. The estimated post-mortem interval\n                    was pronounced to be within the region of 1–2days. 37     On 22 June 2008 at about 9.45 am,\n                    the Accused was arrested at Hotel 12 Pte Ltd by Senior Station Inspector Zainal\n                    Abidin Ismail (“SSI Zainal Abidin”) (PW33), Assistant\n                    Superintendent Christopher Jacob (PW18) and some other officers. After his\n                    arrest, the Accused gave the following statements to the police: (a)First Statement recorded on 22 June 2008 at\n                            10.35 am (D3);(b)Cautioned Statement recorded on 22 June 2008\n                            at 8.35 pm (P144);(c)Investigation Statement recorded on 25 June\n                            2008 at 2.05 pm (P159);(d)Investigation Statement recorded on 26 June\n                            2008 at 9.25 am (P160);(e)Investigation Statement recorded on 26 June\n                            2008 at 3.05 pm (P161); and(f)Investigation Statement recorded in the field\n                            book on 27 June 2008 during the scene investigation\n                        (P165).Case for the Prosecution38     It was the Prosecution’s case that\n                    during the scuffle, the Accused used a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt and\n                    tied it around the Deceased’s neck. In doing so, the Accused had committed\n                    murder by way of strangulation and was therefore liable for the offence under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal\n                    Code”) which stipulates that:Murder300.    Except in the cases\n                            hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder —…(c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any\n                        person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the\n                        ordinary course of nature to cause death39     The Prosecution submitted that it had\n                    discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had\n                    committed the offence of murder under section 300(c) of the Penal\n                    Code:(a)That the Accused did an act which caused the\n                            death of the Deceased;(b)That the said act was done with the intention of\n                            causing bodily injury; and(c)That the injury caused:(i)Was intended and was not accidental or\n                                    otherwise unintentional; and(ii)Was sufficient in the ordinary course of\n                                    nature to cause death.40     The Prosecution based their case,inter alia, on:(a)Forensic evidence such as the autopsy report,\n                            toxicology report and various HSA reports;(b)Oral evidence of the Prosecution’s\n                            witnesses;(c)The sobriety of the Accused at the time of\n                            alleged murder; and(d)The police statements recorded subsequent to the\n                            Accused’s arrest.The Accused did an act which caused the death of the\n                DeceasedForensic Evidence(I)   Autopsy Report41     A/P Gilbert Lau conducted the autopsy on the\n                    Deceased and testified that the cause of death was strangulation by ligature. He\n                    observed that the ligature was a long-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt that was\n                    applied circumferentially to the Deceased’s neck in a single loop and was\n                    secured by a partial slip knot tightly applied at the back of the\n                neck.42     It was found that the ligature was tightly\n                    constricting:(a)The ligature measured an approximate 30cm in\n                            circumference whereas the corresponding ligature mark (measured\n                            immediately after the ligature had been removed) was\n                        36cm;(b)Despite the bloating and swelling of the\n                            Deceased’s face and other body parts, the ligature mark directly\n                            beneath the ligature was actually indented.(b)Moreover, due to the highly constricting nature\n                            of the ligature, the overlying skin around the area where the ligature\n                            was applied was well-preserved as compared to other body parts which\n                            exhibited signs of decomposition; and(d)Extensive fractures were found on the hyoid bone\n                            and thyroid cartilage (as seen in photographs P80 and P81 respectively).\n                            The extent of the damage to the laryngeal structures suggested that\n                            severe force had been applied.43     A/P Gilbert Lau testified that the severe\n                    force that had caused such structural damage would certainly have closed off the\n                    airways and blood vessels around the Deceased’s neck completely, thus\n                    depriving the Deceased’s brain, heart and vital organs of oxygen. He\n                    opined that strangulation by ligature of this nature was sufficient in the\n                    ordinary course of nature to cause death.(II)   Toxicology Report44     Dr. Leong Hsiao Tung\n                    (“Dr. Leong”) (PW5) prepared the Toxicology Report (P132) in\n                    which it was found that,inter alia, the\n                    concentration of ethanol in the Deceased’s blood was 9mg/100ml.\n                    Dr. Leong’s evidence was that the amount of ethanol was not\n                    significant and was likely a result of consumption of alcohol before death or\n                    post-mortem production of ethanol. Based on this post-mortem toxicology report,\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau was able to rule out the possibility that the Deceased might\n                    have been in some way incapacitated before he was set upon by the assailant.\n                    This finding combined with the absence of typical defensive injuries on the\n                    Deceased’s body suggested that the Deceased was taken by surprise or\n                    overpowered very quickly by the assailant.(III)   Other HSA Reports45     The following HSA Reports confirm that there\n                    was contact transfer between the Deceased and the Accused.46     Dr. Christopher K C Syn\n                    (“Dr. Syn”) (PW11), a forensic scientist, gave evidence based\n                    on his Laboratory Report DN-2008-00755 (P133) that the DNA of the Accused was\n                    found on the nail clippings (P225) of the Deceased marked “L1” to\n                    “L5” and “R5”. The Accused’s blood was also\n                    detected (albeit of trace amount) on the said nail clippings marked\n                    “R5” and “L4”.47     Ms Kee Koh Kheng\n                    (“Ms Kee”) (PW28), a Forensic Scientist attached to the\n                    Forensic Science Division of the HSA, compiled the Laboratory Report\n                    No. CR-2008-00119 (P137) which revealed the following\n                findings:Exhibits recovered from deceasedDescription of\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemKhalid/05/2008A pair of black panties\n                                        (P207)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans marked\n                                            “Astro/01/2008”\n                                    (P217)Khalid/06/2008Dark blue brassiere\n                                    (P208)1 fibre was found to be similar to those\n                                            constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/09/2008Brown striped long-sleeved T- shirt\n                                            (P211)29 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/10/2008Orange baju kurung\n                                    (P212)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those of constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans and 1 fibre was similar to\n                                            the control fabric of the Accused’s white singlet\n                                            marked “Astro/03/2008”\n                                        (P219)Exhibits recovered from the accusedDescription of\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemAstro/01/2008A pair of denim jeans\n                                    (P217)4 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the brown striped long-sleeved T-shirt\n                                            marked “Khalid/09/2008”\n                                        (P211)Astro/04/2008White “Converse”\n                                            long-sleeved jacket (P220)3 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the said brown striped long-sleeved\n                                            T-shirt and 1 black fibre was found to be similar to the\n                                            fibres constituting the pair of black panties marked\n                                            “Khalid/05/2008”\n                                    (P207)48     Thus, the HSA Reports read with A/P Gilbert\n                    Lau’s evidence show that the Accused was the person present at the scene\n                    and was the one who had applied the ligature onto the Deceased. The defence does\n                    not dispute this.The said act was done with the intention of causing bodily\n                injury49     The Prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so\n                    intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing\n                    was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed\n                    the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased.50     The Defence conceded this point and did not\n                    rely on the defences of sections 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code,ie, insane intoxication and intoxication negating\n                    intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused\n                    had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The\n                    main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is:wherethe Accused intended to apply and tie the\n                ligature.The injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n                cause death51     The fatal injury in this case was\n                    strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased’s neck.\n                    Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression\n                    led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the\n                neck.52     A/P Gilbert Lau’s evidence was that the\n                    said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He\n                    was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a\n                    ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost\n                    consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a\n                    matter of minutes.The injury caused was intended and was not accidental or otherwise\n                unintentional53     The prosecution submitted that: the tying of\n                    ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not\n                    unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the\n                    Deceased’s forearms and wrists was not unintentional.54     Three possible scenarios as to what might have\n                    happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court:(a)The Accused knowingly tied the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s neck;(b)After tying the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s mouth, the T-shirt became dislodged and ended up on the\n                            neck of the Deceased and was subsequently tightened around the neck by\n                            the Deceased’s movements while he was struggling;\n                        or(c)During the placing of the T-shirt around the\n                            mouth, the T-shirt was accidentally or mistakenly placed onto the\n                            neck.55     It was the Prosecution’s case that the\n                    Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck,\n                    thereby suggesting that the Accused’s evidence that he only intended to\n                    tie the Deceased’s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent\n                    to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the\n                    Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised\n                    the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on\n                    it.56     The Prosecution also submitted that the\n                    Accused’s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative\n                    stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in\n                    order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.57     Given the inherent inconsistencies of the\n                    Accused’s statements, it was thus the Prosecution’s position that\n                    the Accused’s statements should be disregarded, and the court should\n                    therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective\n                    evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted\n                    that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the\n                    Accused had committed murder under section 300(c) of the Penal Code against\n                    the Deceased.Case for the Defence58     It was the Defence’s case that:(a)The Accused only intended to tie the ligature\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(b)The Deceased and the Accused were not\n                            lovers;(c)The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of\n                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an\n                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and(d)In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of\n                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and\n                            provocation.Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck.60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that:(a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "Case for the Prosecution": "38     It was the Prosecution’s case that\n                    during the scuffle, the Accused used a long-sleeved brown striped T-shirt and\n                    tied it around the Deceased’s neck. In doing so, the Accused had committed\n                    murder by way of strangulation and was therefore liable for the offence under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the Penal\n                    Code”) which stipulates that: Murder 300.    Except in the cases\n                            hereinafter excepted culpable homicide is murder — … (c) if it is done with the intention of causing bodily injury to any\n                        person, and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the\n                        ordinary course of nature to cause death 39     The Prosecution submitted that it had\n                    discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had\n                    committed the offence of murder under section 300(c) of the Penal\n                    Code: (a)That the Accused did an act which caused the\n                            death of the Deceased;(b)That the said act was done with the intention of\n                            causing bodily injury; and(c)That the injury caused:(i)Was intended and was not accidental or\n                                    otherwise unintentional; and(ii)Was sufficient in the ordinary course of\n                                    nature to cause death.40     The Prosecution based their case,inter alia, on:(a)Forensic evidence such as the autopsy report,\n                            toxicology report and various HSA reports;(b)Oral evidence of the Prosecution’s\n                            witnesses;(c)The sobriety of the Accused at the time of\n                            alleged murder; and(d)The police statements recorded subsequent to the\n                            Accused’s arrest.The Accused did an act which caused the death of the\n                DeceasedForensic Evidence(I)   Autopsy Report41     A/P Gilbert Lau conducted the autopsy on the\n                    Deceased and testified that the cause of death was strangulation by ligature. He\n                    observed that the ligature was a long-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt that was\n                    applied circumferentially to the Deceased’s neck in a single loop and was\n                    secured by a partial slip knot tightly applied at the back of the\n                neck.42     It was found that the ligature was tightly\n                    constricting:(a)The ligature measured an approximate 30cm in\n                            circumference whereas the corresponding ligature mark (measured\n                            immediately after the ligature had been removed) was\n                        36cm;(b)Despite the bloating and swelling of the\n                            Deceased’s face and other body parts, the ligature mark directly\n                            beneath the ligature was actually indented.(b)Moreover, due to the highly constricting nature\n                            of the ligature, the overlying skin around the area where the ligature\n                            was applied was well-preserved as compared to other body parts which\n                            exhibited signs of decomposition; and(d)Extensive fractures were found on the hyoid bone\n                            and thyroid cartilage (as seen in photographs P80 and P81 respectively).\n                            The extent of the damage to the laryngeal structures suggested that\n                            severe force had been applied.43     A/P Gilbert Lau testified that the severe\n                    force that had caused such structural damage would certainly have closed off the\n                    airways and blood vessels around the Deceased’s neck completely, thus\n                    depriving the Deceased’s brain, heart and vital organs of oxygen. He\n                    opined that strangulation by ligature of this nature was sufficient in the\n                    ordinary course of nature to cause death.(II)   Toxicology Report44     Dr. Leong Hsiao Tung\n                    (“Dr. Leong”) (PW5) prepared the Toxicology Report (P132) in\n                    which it was found that,inter alia, the\n                    concentration of ethanol in the Deceased’s blood was 9mg/100ml.\n                    Dr. Leong’s evidence was that the amount of ethanol was not\n                    significant and was likely a result of consumption of alcohol before death or\n                    post-mortem production of ethanol. Based on this post-mortem toxicology report,\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau was able to rule out the possibility that the Deceased might\n                    have been in some way incapacitated before he was set upon by the assailant.\n                    This finding combined with the absence of typical defensive injuries on the\n                    Deceased’s body suggested that the Deceased was taken by surprise or\n                    overpowered very quickly by the assailant.(III)   Other HSA Reports45     The following HSA Reports confirm that there\n                    was contact transfer between the Deceased and the Accused.46     Dr. Christopher K C Syn\n                    (“Dr. Syn”) (PW11), a forensic scientist, gave evidence based\n                    on his Laboratory Report DN-2008-00755 (P133) that the DNA of the Accused was\n                    found on the nail clippings (P225) of the Deceased marked “L1” to\n                    “L5” and “R5”. The Accused’s blood was also\n                    detected (albeit of trace amount) on the said nail clippings marked\n                    “R5” and “L4”.47     Ms Kee Koh Kheng\n                    (“Ms Kee”) (PW28), a Forensic Scientist attached to the\n                    Forensic Science Division of the HSA, compiled the Laboratory Report\n                    No. CR-2008-00119 (P137) which revealed the following\n                findings:Exhibits recovered from deceasedDescription of\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemKhalid/05/2008A pair of black panties\n                                        (P207)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans marked\n                                            “Astro/01/2008”\n                                    (P217)Khalid/06/2008Dark blue brassiere\n                                    (P208)1 fibre was found to be similar to those\n                                            constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/09/2008Brown striped long-sleeved T- shirt\n                                            (P211)29 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/10/2008Orange baju kurung\n                                    (P212)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those of constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans and 1 fibre was similar to\n                                            the control fabric of the Accused’s white singlet\n                                            marked “Astro/03/2008”\n                                        (P219)Exhibits recovered from the accusedDescription of\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemAstro/01/2008A pair of denim jeans\n                                    (P217)4 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the brown striped long-sleeved T-shirt\n                                            marked “Khalid/09/2008”\n                                        (P211)Astro/04/2008White “Converse”\n                                            long-sleeved jacket (P220)3 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the said brown striped long-sleeved\n                                            T-shirt and 1 black fibre was found to be similar to the\n                                            fibres constituting the pair of black panties marked\n                                            “Khalid/05/2008”\n                                    (P207)48     Thus, the HSA Reports read with A/P Gilbert\n                    Lau’s evidence show that the Accused was the person present at the scene\n                    and was the one who had applied the ligature onto the Deceased. The defence does\n                    not dispute this.The said act was done with the intention of causing bodily\n                injury49     The Prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so\n                    intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing\n                    was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed\n                    the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased.50     The Defence conceded this point and did not\n                    rely on the defences of sections 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code,ie, insane intoxication and intoxication negating\n                    intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused\n                    had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The\n                    main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is:wherethe Accused intended to apply and tie the\n                ligature.The injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n                cause death51     The fatal injury in this case was\n                    strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased’s neck.\n                    Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression\n                    led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the\n                neck.52     A/P Gilbert Lau’s evidence was that the\n                    said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He\n                    was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a\n                    ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost\n                    consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a\n                    matter of minutes.The injury caused was intended and was not accidental or otherwise\n                unintentional53     The prosecution submitted that: the tying of\n                    ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not\n                    unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the\n                    Deceased’s forearms and wrists was not unintentional.54     Three possible scenarios as to what might have\n                    happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court:(a)The Accused knowingly tied the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s neck;(b)After tying the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s mouth, the T-shirt became dislodged and ended up on the\n                            neck of the Deceased and was subsequently tightened around the neck by\n                            the Deceased’s movements while he was struggling;\n                        or(c)During the placing of the T-shirt around the\n                            mouth, the T-shirt was accidentally or mistakenly placed onto the\n                            neck.55     It was the Prosecution’s case that the\n                    Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck,\n                    thereby suggesting that the Accused’s evidence that he only intended to\n                    tie the Deceased’s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent\n                    to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the\n                    Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised\n                    the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on\n                    it.56     The Prosecution also submitted that the\n                    Accused’s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative\n                    stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in\n                    order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.57     Given the inherent inconsistencies of the\n                    Accused’s statements, it was thus the Prosecution’s position that\n                    the Accused’s statements should be disregarded, and the court should\n                    therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective\n                    evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted\n                    that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the\n                    Accused had committed murder under section 300(c) of the Penal Code against\n                    the Deceased.Case for the Defence58     It was the Defence’s case that:(a)The Accused only intended to tie the ligature\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(b)The Deceased and the Accused were not\n                            lovers;(c)The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of\n                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an\n                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and(d)In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of\n                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and\n                            provocation.Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck.60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that:(a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "The Accused did an act which caused the death of the\n                Deceased": "Forensic Evidence (I)   Autopsy Report 41     A/P Gilbert Lau conducted the autopsy on the\n                    Deceased and testified that the cause of death was strangulation by ligature. He\n                    observed that the ligature was a long-sleeved, crew neck T-shirt that was\n                    applied circumferentially to the Deceased’s neck in a single loop and was\n                    secured by a partial slip knot tightly applied at the back of the\n                neck. 42     It was found that the ligature was tightly\n                    constricting: (a)The ligature measured an approximate 30cm in\n                            circumference whereas the corresponding ligature mark (measured\n                            immediately after the ligature had been removed) was\n                        36cm;(b)Despite the bloating and swelling of the\n                            Deceased’s face and other body parts, the ligature mark directly\n                            beneath the ligature was actually indented.(b)Moreover, due to the highly constricting nature\n                            of the ligature, the overlying skin around the area where the ligature\n                            was applied was well-preserved as compared to other body parts which\n                            exhibited signs of decomposition; and(d)Extensive fractures were found on the hyoid bone\n                            and thyroid cartilage (as seen in photographs P80 and P81 respectively).\n                            The extent of the damage to the laryngeal structures suggested that\n                            severe force had been applied.43     A/P Gilbert Lau testified that the severe\n                    force that had caused such structural damage would certainly have closed off the\n                    airways and blood vessels around the Deceased’s neck completely, thus\n                    depriving the Deceased’s brain, heart and vital organs of oxygen. He\n                    opined that strangulation by ligature of this nature was sufficient in the\n                    ordinary course of nature to cause death.(II)   Toxicology Report44     Dr. Leong Hsiao Tung\n                    (“Dr. Leong”) (PW5) prepared the Toxicology Report (P132) in\n                    which it was found that,inter alia, the\n                    concentration of ethanol in the Deceased’s blood was 9mg/100ml.\n                    Dr. Leong’s evidence was that the amount of ethanol was not\n                    significant and was likely a result of consumption of alcohol before death or\n                    post-mortem production of ethanol. Based on this post-mortem toxicology report,\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau was able to rule out the possibility that the Deceased might\n                    have been in some way incapacitated before he was set upon by the assailant.\n                    This finding combined with the absence of typical defensive injuries on the\n                    Deceased’s body suggested that the Deceased was taken by surprise or\n                    overpowered very quickly by the assailant.(III)   Other HSA Reports45     The following HSA Reports confirm that there\n                    was contact transfer between the Deceased and the Accused.46     Dr. Christopher K C Syn\n                    (“Dr. Syn”) (PW11), a forensic scientist, gave evidence based\n                    on his Laboratory Report DN-2008-00755 (P133) that the DNA of the Accused was\n                    found on the nail clippings (P225) of the Deceased marked “L1” to\n                    “L5” and “R5”. The Accused’s blood was also\n                    detected (albeit of trace amount) on the said nail clippings marked\n                    “R5” and “L4”.47     Ms Kee Koh Kheng\n                    (“Ms Kee”) (PW28), a Forensic Scientist attached to the\n                    Forensic Science Division of the HSA, compiled the Laboratory Report\n                    No. CR-2008-00119 (P137) which revealed the following\n                findings:Exhibits recovered from deceasedDescription of\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Deceased’s\n                                    itemKhalid/05/2008A pair of black panties\n                                        (P207)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans marked\n                                            “Astro/01/2008”\n                                    (P217)Khalid/06/2008Dark blue brassiere\n                                    (P208)1 fibre was found to be similar to those\n                                            constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/09/2008Brown striped long-sleeved T- shirt\n                                            (P211)29 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeansKhalid/10/2008Orange baju kurung\n                                    (P212)16 fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            those of constituting the control fabric of the said\n                                            Accused’s denim jeans and 1 fibre was similar to\n                                            the control fabric of the Accused’s white singlet\n                                            marked “Astro/03/2008”\n                                        (P219)Exhibits recovered from the accusedDescription of\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemMatches found on\n                                                Accused’s\n                                    itemAstro/01/2008A pair of denim jeans\n                                    (P217)4 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the brown striped long-sleeved T-shirt\n                                            marked “Khalid/09/2008”\n                                        (P211)Astro/04/2008White “Converse”\n                                            long-sleeved jacket (P220)3 brown fibres were found to be similar to\n                                            the fibres of the said brown striped long-sleeved\n                                            T-shirt and 1 black fibre was found to be similar to the\n                                            fibres constituting the pair of black panties marked\n                                            “Khalid/05/2008”\n                                    (P207)48     Thus, the HSA Reports read with A/P Gilbert\n                    Lau’s evidence show that the Accused was the person present at the scene\n                    and was the one who had applied the ligature onto the Deceased. The defence does\n                    not dispute this.The said act was done with the intention of causing bodily\n                injury49     The Prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so\n                    intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing\n                    was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed\n                    the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased.50     The Defence conceded this point and did not\n                    rely on the defences of sections 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code,ie, insane intoxication and intoxication negating\n                    intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused\n                    had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The\n                    main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is:wherethe Accused intended to apply and tie the\n                ligature.The injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n                cause death51     The fatal injury in this case was\n                    strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased’s neck.\n                    Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression\n                    led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the\n                neck.52     A/P Gilbert Lau’s evidence was that the\n                    said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He\n                    was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a\n                    ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost\n                    consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a\n                    matter of minutes.The injury caused was intended and was not accidental or otherwise\n                unintentional53     The prosecution submitted that: the tying of\n                    ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not\n                    unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the\n                    Deceased’s forearms and wrists was not unintentional.54     Three possible scenarios as to what might have\n                    happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court:(a)The Accused knowingly tied the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s neck;(b)After tying the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s mouth, the T-shirt became dislodged and ended up on the\n                            neck of the Deceased and was subsequently tightened around the neck by\n                            the Deceased’s movements while he was struggling;\n                        or(c)During the placing of the T-shirt around the\n                            mouth, the T-shirt was accidentally or mistakenly placed onto the\n                            neck.55     It was the Prosecution’s case that the\n                    Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck,\n                    thereby suggesting that the Accused’s evidence that he only intended to\n                    tie the Deceased’s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent\n                    to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the\n                    Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised\n                    the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on\n                    it.56     The Prosecution also submitted that the\n                    Accused’s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative\n                    stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in\n                    order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.57     Given the inherent inconsistencies of the\n                    Accused’s statements, it was thus the Prosecution’s position that\n                    the Accused’s statements should be disregarded, and the court should\n                    therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective\n                    evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted\n                    that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the\n                    Accused had committed murder under section 300(c) of the Penal Code against\n                    the Deceased.Case for the Defence58     It was the Defence’s case that:(a)The Accused only intended to tie the ligature\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(b)The Deceased and the Accused were not\n                            lovers;(c)The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of\n                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an\n                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and(d)In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of\n                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and\n                            provocation.Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck.60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that:(a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "The said act was done with the intention of causing bodily\n                injury": "49     The Prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    was sober when he committed the alleged offence in the sense that he was not so\n                    intoxicated that he was not aware of what he was doing or that what he was doing\n                    was wrong. The Accused was also not so intoxicated that he could not have formed\n                    the necessary intention to cause bodily injury to the Deceased. 50     The Defence conceded this point and did not\n                    rely on the defences of sections 85(2)(b) or 86(2) of the Penal Code,ie, insane intoxication and intoxication negating\n                    intention respectively. In other words, the Defence conceded that the Accused\n                    had the intention of applying and tying up the ligature on the Deceased. The\n                    main issue which divides the Prosecution and Defence is:wherethe Accused intended to apply and tie the\n                ligature.",
        "The injury caused was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n                cause death": "51     The fatal injury in this case was\n                    strangulation caused by the ligature found on the Deceased’s neck.\n                    Considerable force was used in tying the ligature such that acute compression\n                    led to the fracture of the laryngeal structures located in the\n                neck. 52     A/P Gilbert Lau’s evidence was that the\n                    said injury was sufficient, in the normal course of nature, to cause death. He\n                    was able to comment, with reasonable confidence, that the application of a\n                    ligature of this nature would in all likelihood caused the Deceased to have lost\n                    consciousness within a matter of seconds and death would have taken place in a\n                    matter of minutes.",
        "The injury caused was intended and was not accidental or otherwise\n                unintentional": "53     The prosecution submitted that: the tying of\n                    ligature was not unintentional; the tying of the partial knot was not\n                    unintentional; the winding of the remaining part of the T-shirt around the\n                    Deceased’s forearms and wrists was not unintentional. 54     Three possible scenarios as to what might have\n                    happened on the night of 19 June 2008 were presented to the court: (a)The Accused knowingly tied the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s neck;(b)After tying the T-shirt around the\n                            Deceased’s mouth, the T-shirt became dislodged and ended up on the\n                            neck of the Deceased and was subsequently tightened around the neck by\n                            the Deceased’s movements while he was struggling;\n                        or(c)During the placing of the T-shirt around the\n                            mouth, the T-shirt was accidentally or mistakenly placed onto the\n                            neck.55     It was the Prosecution’s case that the\n                    Accused had knowingly tied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck,\n                    thereby suggesting that the Accused’s evidence that he only intended to\n                    tie the Deceased’s mouth and that he might have accidentally tied it\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was untrue. The Prosecution found it pertinent\n                    to note that when A/P Gilbert Lau was being cross-examined by the Defence, the\n                    Defence had adopted possibility (b). It was only after A/P Gilbert Lau raised\n                    the possibility of scenario (c) that the Defence sought to build their case on\n                    it.56     The Prosecution also submitted that the\n                    Accused’s inconsistent statements (those recorded during investigative\n                    stages and those made in court) formed the bulk of lies which were conjured in\n                    order to exculpate himself and escape the death penalty.57     Given the inherent inconsistencies of the\n                    Accused’s statements, it was thus the Prosecution’s position that\n                    the Accused’s statements should be disregarded, and the court should\n                    therefore base its decision on the evidence of A/P Gilbert Lau and the objective\n                    evidence presented before the court. On such a basis, the Prosecution submitted\n                    that it has discharged the burden of proving beyond reasonable doubt that the\n                    Accused had committed murder under section 300(c) of the Penal Code against\n                    the Deceased.Case for the Defence58     It was the Defence’s case that:(a)The Accused only intended to tie the ligature\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(b)The Deceased and the Accused were not\n                            lovers;(c)The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of\n                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an\n                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and(d)In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of\n                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and\n                            provocation.Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck.60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that:(a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "Case for the Defence": "58     It was the Defence’s case that: (a)The Accused only intended to tie the ligature\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(b)The Deceased and the Accused were not\n                            lovers;(c)The Prosecution did not discharge its burden of\n                            proving beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused had committed an\n                            offence under section 300(c) of the Penal Code; and(d)In any event, the Defence had, on a balance of\n                            probabilities, made out the defences of sudden fight and\n                            provocation.Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck.60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that:(a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "Accused only intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                mouth": "59     During cross examination, Defence counsel\n                    suggested to A/P Gilbert Lau a possible scenario of the tightening of ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck: that the Deceased had in the course of\n                    struggling, suffered the misfortune of killing himself by tightening the\n                    ligature (initially applied around the mouth) that had slipped around his\n                    neck. 60     A/P Gilbert Lau rejected Counsel’s\n                    suggestion, reasoning that: (a)If the T-shirt had slipped to the\n                            Deceased’s neck, the partial slip knot would have been loosened\n                            even further as opposed to being tightened by his struggle. In fact, the\n                            T-shirt should be hanging loosely around his neck if this were the\n                            case;(b)Furthermore, the free ends of the ligature were\n                            wound around the Deceased’s upper limbs and wrists in a loose\n                            manner. Therefore, if the Deceased had been conscious or alive when the\n                            T-shirt slipped to his neck, he could have easily unwound the free end\n                            around his hands and release the ligature; and(c)In any case, it was almost inconceivable for the\n                            gag which was placed over the mouth to slip and then to be tightly\n                            constricted by the Deceased’s own movements. This was because\n                            severe force must have been used to cause the fracture of the greater\n                            cornua of the hyoid bone, superior horns and laminae of the thyroid\n                            cartilage. A person would have, in all probability, passed out before he\n                            could apply such severe force to himself.61     The suggestion that the Accused saw the\n                    Deceased shaking and frothing at the mouth when the latter had fallen backwards\n                    and hit himself against the wardrobe in the course of the scuffle was also\n                    refuted by A/P Gilbert Lau. He opined that the Deceased did not suffer from any\n                    natural disease that could have accounted for such a reaction. Furthermore, such\n                    reaction could not have come from a person suffering from a mild state of\n                    shock.62     A/P Gilbert Lau, however, opined that he would\n                    not dispel the possibility that the Accused might have thought that he had\n                    applied the ligature to the mouth with the intention of applying a gag, when it\n                    had actually been applied to the neck instead.63     The Defence submitted that the Accused did not\n                    have the intention to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck. The\n                    following statements recorded from the Accused supported this position:(a)The Accused’s statement recorded by\n                            Inspector Kwok Charn Kong (“Inspector Kwok”) (PW31) on\n                            26 June 2008 (P160) in which he specifically stated that it was not\n                            his intention to kill the Deceased and that when he was arrested, he was\n                            under the impression that he was being apprehended for theft of the\n                            Deceased’s jewellery. If he had known that the Deceased had died,\n                            he would not have stayed in Singapore;(b)The Accused also repeated that he had no\n                            intention to cause the Deceased’s death and that he did not expect\n                            his punches to cause the Deceased to die because when he left him, he\n                            was still alive; and(c)In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                            testified that he had only intended to gag the Deceased’s mouth as\n                            the Deceased was making a lot of noise. He further stated that he did\n                            not know whether the T-shirt went around the Deceased’s mouth or\n                            not but his intention was just to tie the Deceased’s\n                        mouth.Finding of the court64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c):Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present;Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations.Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended.Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and,Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender.65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that:The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion.[emphasis added]66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated:Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused.67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional.68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.Accused’s police statements and evidence in court69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements.70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay.71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased.72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom.73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased:(a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "Finding of the court": "64     Thelocus\n                        classicusof section 300(c) of the Penal Code is the\n                    decision of the Indian Supreme Court inVirsa Singh v State\n                        of PunjabAIR 1958 SC 465(“Virsa\n                        Singh”)where it was held at [12] that four elements must\n                    be proved to establish murder under section 300(c): Firstly, it must establish, quite objectively, that a bodily injury is\n                        present; Secondly, the nature of the injury must be proved; These are purely\n                        objective investigations. Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an intention to inflict that\n                        particular bodily injury, that is to say, that it was not accidental or\n                        unintentional, or that some other kind of injury was intended. Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry proceeds\n                        further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the type just described\n                        made up of the three elements set out above is sufficient to cause death in\n                        the ordinary course of nature. This part of the enquiry is purely objective\n                        and inferential and has nothing to do with the intention of the\n                        offender. 65     In further explaining the third element, which\n                    is the element in dispute in the present case, Bose J at [16] held\n                    that: The question is not whether the prisoner intended to inflict a serious\n                        injury or a trivial one butwhether he intended to\n                            inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can\n                        show that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify such\n                        an inference, then, of course, the intent the section requires is not\n                        proved. But if there is nothing beyond the injury and the fact that the\n                        appellant inflicted it, the only possible inference is that he intended to\n                        inflict it. Whether he knew of its seriousness or intended serious\n                        consequences, is neither here nor there.The question, so\n                            far as the intention is concerned, is not whether he intended to kill,\n                            or to inflict an injury of a particular degree of seriousness but\n                            whether he intended to inflict the injury in question; and\n                        once the existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will be\n                        presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant an opposite\n                        conclusion. [emphasis added] 66     In the case ofPP v Lim Poh\n                        Lye[2005] 4 SLR(R) 582 (“Lim\n                        Poh Lye”) the accused was found to have intended to stab\n                    the victim’s thigh to prevent him from struggling and escaping. Although\n                    it was true that the fatal stab wound was caused to a body part which was not\n                    commonly known to be a vulnerable region of the body, that was not a\n                    consideration that affected the operation of section 300(c). The crucial\n                    question to ask is whether the wounds that were caused were in fact wounds which\n                    the accused intended to cause. As the court inTan Chee Wee v\n                        PP[2004] 1 SLR(R) 479 (“Tan\n                        Chee Wee”) at [42] stated: Section 300(c) thus envisions that the accused subjectively intends\n                        to cause a bodily injury that is objectively likely to cause death in the\n                        ordinary course of nature ... It is in fact irrelevant whether or not the\n                        accused did intend to cause death, so long as death ensues from the bodily\n                        injury or injuries intentionally caused. 67     The Defence rigorously sought to demonstrate\n                    that the Accused did not have the intention to cause the injury which caused the\n                    death of the Deceased,ie, his intention was to\n                    tie the ligature around the Deceased’s mouth and such a tying over the\n                    mouth does not, in the ordinary course of nature, cause death. Hence, the\n                    Defence’s position was that the applying and tightening of ligature around\n                    the neck was accidental or unintentional. 68     Chao Hick Tin JA at [22] ofLim Poh Lye, emphasised that the third limb ofVirsa Singh,ie, whether a\n                    particular injury was accidental or unintended is a question of fact which has\n                    to be determined by the court in light of the evidence adduced and taking into\n                    account all the surrounding circumstances of the case. If the court should at\n                    the end of the day find that the accused only intended to cause a particular\n                    “minor injury”, to use the term of the court inTan Joo Cheng v PP[1992] 1 SLR(R) 219, which injury\n                    would not, in the normal course of nature, cause death, but in fact caused a\n                    different injury sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\n                    section 300(c) would not be attracted. Thus, it is incumbent upon this\n                    court to decideon the totality of the evidence having regard\n                        to all the surrounding circumstances, whether the requisite\n                    intention in section 300(c) had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt by\n                    the Prosecution.",
        "Accused’s police statements and evidence in court": "69     Notably, the Prosecution strongly urged the\n                    court to disregard the Accused’s statements. 70     In relation to the mixed statements of an\n                    accused containing incriminating as well as exculpatory parts, the decision ofTan Chee Hwee and another v PP[1993]\n                    2 SLR(R) 492 (“Tan Chee\n                    Hwee”) is instructive: the court had to approach the\n                    incriminating portion with the exculpatory or explanatory parts of the\n                    accused’s statements together with all the surrounding circumstances to\n                    decide where the truth lay. 71     The Accused was depicted by the prosecution as\n                    a conniving liar who was capable of lying unabashedly even in the face of a\n                    statutory warning. His ability to breathe life into two wholly fictitious,\n                    non-existent characters (ie, Zulkarnian and\n                    Khairul) and to vividly recount a robbery (filled with titillating details from\n                    its conception to execution) that had never taken place were tell-tale signs of\n                    a master of fabrication. In his first investigation statement (D3) and cautioned\n                    statement (P144), Zulkarnian and Khairul were seen as the masterminds behind the\n                    plot whereas he was just an accessory, a mere passive look-out. He then\n                    confessed to SSI Zainal Abidin that he had lied to relieve himself from\n                    shouldering the burden or responsibility of having caused the death of the\n                    Deceased. 72     With regard to the Accused’s other\n                    statements,ie, P159, P160 and P161, the\n                    Prosecution submitted that these were mixed statements. Although the Accused, at\n                    this juncture, admitted to being the sole assailant, he had however sought to\n                    exonerate himself by claiming that he had merely tied the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck. The Accused also stressed in court,\n                    numerous times, that the Deceased was still alive when he left the\n                    bedroom. 73     Furthermore, the Accused, during his\n                    examination-in-chief had adopted different stances as to what happenedduringthe act of tying up the Deceased: (a)That he tied one loop around the\n                        mouth;(b)He pulled the T-shirt but did not know whether it\n                            went around the mouth or not, although his intention was to tie it\n                            around the Deceased’s mouth;(c)The Accused tied a complete knot (D5) during his\n                            demonstration in court;(d)While answering the court’s question, the\n                            Accused’s reply was that he did not tie the Deceased’s neck;\n                            he only tied the Deceased’s mouth; and(e)When counsel related the evidence of A/P Gilbert\n                            Lau, the Accused’s reply was that he disagreed with his evidence\n                            because he was certain that he tied up the Deceased’s mouth. This\n                            was despite the fact that he did not check after tying up the\n                            Deceased.The Accused’s constant change in stance before the court was,\n                    according to the Prosecution, a clear illustration of how he would subtly tailor\n                    his evidence in order to convince the court that he did not kill the Deceased as\n                    he ‘intended to only cover the Deceased’s\n                mouth’.74     The Prosecution’s impeachment of the\n                    Accused’s credibility and veracity was based on the fact that all his\n                    lies, from the start of investigation to the proceedings in court, pertained to\n                    one of the most crucial aspects of the case:howdid the Accused apply the ligature on the Deceased. Was it merely coincidental\n                    that the Accused had, throughout the case, conveniently invented characters and\n                    varied his statements as to how and where the ligature was applied at the most\n                    critical junctures?75     The prosecution submitted that it was trite\n                    law that lies could be corroborative of guilt. Adverse inference should be drawn\n                    against the Accused as warranted under section 123 Criminal Procedure Code\n                    (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the CPC”) in respect of his lie in his\n                    section 122(6) cautioned statement (P144). Thus, the court should not\n                    accept the Accused’s defence that he had only intended to tie the\n                    Deceased’s mouth and not the neck.76     The Defence, on the other hand, proffered some\n                    explanations for the Accused’s reason for lying and giving inconsistent\n                    statements:Examination–in-chief of\n                            accusedQ: (In relation to the accused’s first investigation statement [D3])\n                        Could you explain why is it that you have given this untrue version of\n                        events?A: When I was arrested in Hotel 12, and [sic] Mr Zainal introduced himself as a police officer. My\n                        handphone was seized. He asked me where did I keep [sic] the items. And I told him that once we get back I will\n                        tell him the story. When we reached the police station, before he took my\n                        statement[,] he told me that Khalid had passed away and I asked\n                        “who”[.] Then he said it is the person I took the jewellery\n                        [from]. I was in shock. I thought it was impossible cos [sic] at the time I left[,] he was alive. Mr Zainal asked me\n                        to narrate the story. So I was afraid and made up this story.Q:    I can understand that you were afraid, but you have\n                            given a lot of details for something that didn’t really happen.\n                            How come?A:    With regards to Zul, I just told Zul then Mr Zainal\n                            asked me ‘just Zul?’ then I told him more\n                        detailsCourt:    What about the other details?Witness: I made it up. It is my imagination. From the things I took from\n                        Kak Mie, I just continued the story. I didn’t know that she had\n                        died.Court:    You were under pressure, were you\n                            afraid?Witness: I was shocked.77     Although SSI Zainal Abidin was under the\n                    impression that the Accused knew that the Deceased had died when he was being\n                    interviewed and D3 was being recorded, the Defence, however, maintained its\n                    stance that upon arrest, the Accused thought that it was in relation to the\n                    theft of the Deceased’s jewellery. Therefore when he was informed of the\n                    death, it was natural that he was very shocked.78     Furthermore, the Defence also submitted that\n                    the Accused was not someone who had plotted the whole story over a period of\n                    time in order to lie to the police as there was only a 3 day interval between\n                    the Deceased’s death and the Accused’s arrest. His emotions on\n                    hearing the news of the death led to his imagination taking control over\n                    him.79     As to why the Accused lied twice in a day, his\n                    explanation was that he was very frightened when the first statement (D3) and\n                    cautioned statement (P144) were taken. The Accused later decided to come clean\n                    and relate the true story to Inspector Kwok after SSI Zainal Abidin told him\n                    that he did not believe in his story about Zulkarnian and Khairul.80     The Defence submitted that the Accused was\n                    forthcoming during his examination-in-chief in which he admitted to his own\n                    lies. Moreover, the Accused furnished a plausible explanation as to why he had\n                    lied: he had never had any run in with the law prior to this case and therefore,\n                    it must have been alarming and shocking for him to be apprehended for such a\n                    serious and grave offence. The Accused had lied under those circumstances as he\n                    was in a state of shock, despair and confusion, causing him to be ‘not in\n                    a proper state of mind’.81     The Court of Criminal Appeal inChan Kin Choi v PP[1991] 1 SLR(R) 111\n                        (“Chan Kin Choi”) held that once\n                    the Defence was called (as it was in this case), the trial judges who were\n                    performing the role of deciders of fact must consider the whole statement,both the incriminating parts and excuses or\n                        explanations, in deciding where the truth lay. Thus, this court\n                    should consider the incriminating portion of the Accused’s statements and\n                    the lies, having regard to the exculpatory or explanatory parts of his\n                    statements, his evidence in court and all the surrounding circumstances in its\n                    endeavour to determine what the true facts are.82     In the case ofTan Chee\n                        Hwee and another v PP[1993] 2 SLR(R) 493\n                        (“Tan Chee Hwee”), there were\n                    inconsistencies between the appellants’ police statements and their\n                    evidence in court. Tan, the first appellant, had in his police statement stated\n                    that he and Soon (the second appellant) had strangled the maid with the cord of\n                    an electric iron as opposed to using his bare hands. His explanation for the\n                    discrepancy was that at the time he gave the confession statement, his\n                    grandfather had passed away and he was confused. In his oral evidence, Tan also\n                    admitted that some parts of his statements to the police were\n                lies.83     As for the second appellant, he admitted\n                    during cross-examination that his statements to the police made no mention of\n                    Tan rendering the maid unconscious with his bare hands because he was scared,\n                    confused and disorientated at the time of interrogation. Soon maintained\n                    throughout his evidence that his intention that day was to “take the\n                    money” and that he had no intention whatsoever of killing the maid. He\n                    also admitted to lying to the police when he had said that he only learnt of the\n                    maid’s death from the newspapers the next morning.84     Karthigesu J at [46] noted that far\n                    from being overwhelming, it would be totally unsafe (as the judicial\n                    commissioner below had done) to disregard the section 122(6) statement of\n                    Tan as well as the explanation given in his long statement and conclude that,\n                    when Tan with the help of Soon placed the cord of the electric iron around the\n                    body of the violently struggling maid, it was not to tie her up around the waist\n                    but to strangle her with it around the neck.85     Karthigesu J opined that taken as a\n                    whole andgiving such weight to the exculpatory portions of\n                        the statements, short of disregarding them altogether, the\n                    evidence was equally consistent with an intention to tie the maid up without any\n                    intention of causing her bodily injury. The fact that the first appellant did\n                    not hit the maid with the iron and instead used it to tie her up strongly\n                    suggested that even at the critical moment the first appellant could not have\n                    formed an intention to strangle the maid with the cord of the electric iron as a\n                    means of silencing her forever. In those circumstances, the court inTan Chee Hweewas driven to conclude that the injury\n                    which was in fact caused to the maid around her neck, in all probability, was\n                    not intentionally but accidentally or unintentionally caused. See\n                [46].86     I note that in the application of theVirsa Singhtest to the factual matrix of the\n                    present case, there are no difficulties in meeting the requirements of the\n                    first, second and fourth limb of the said test. The third test, being as\n                    contentious and vexing as it is, forms the critical dividing point between the\n                    Prosecution and the Defence. In order to determine whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck, it would be\n                    prudent to assess all the Accused’s statements, both incriminating and\n                    exculpatory, and his oral evidence in court together with the objective\n                    evidence.Objective evidence of the case87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck.88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved.89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt.90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind.91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities?92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case.93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone.94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death.95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code.96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code:Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished —…(b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause deathDefence of Provocation97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code.98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all.99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution.100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations:(a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration. However, no laceration was found on the\n                            Deceased’s face; and(b)The congealed blood, in all probability, would\n                            have resulted from bleeding caused by the bursting of capillaries in the\n                            nose due to congestion which was in turn caused by the tightly applied\n                            ligature to the neck.146    Even if I were to characterise the brief\n                    struggle as a fight, there is nothing to show that the ligature was applied\n                    during the sudden fight in the heat of passionupon a sudden\n                        quarrel. The Deceased’s act of cajoling the Accused and the\n                    Accused’s brushing his advances off cannot in any way be seen as quarrel.\n                    This is crucial because the operation of the exception requires that there must\n                    be a killing whilst both parties are gripped by the inflammation of passions\n                    caused by a sudden quarrel. SeeTan Chee Weeat\n                    [63].147    Given that there is a lack of quarrel and/or\n                    fight from the objective evidence, the first limb of the defence is not made out\n                    and this court therefore takes the view that the defence of sudden fight does\n                    not apply to the present case.Conclusion148    In light of the foregoing, I find the\n                    Accused not guilty of the charge of murder under section 300 of the Penal\n                    Code. However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code. As it was done with the knowledge that it is\n                    likely to cause death, but without any intention to cause death, or to cause\n                    such bodily injury as is likely to cause death, it is punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. Accordingly I convict him of the offence\n                    of culpable homicide under section 299 and punish him under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code. I shall adjourn for the Prosecution and\n                    the Defence to prepare their submissions on sentence.",
        "Objective evidence of the case": "87     The forensic evidence, especially those\n                    provided by A/P Gilbert Lau, can offer only so much assistance as to establish\n                    the degree of force used in applying the ligature, the internal injuries caused\n                    and whether they were sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause\n                    death. Although A/P Gilbert Lau was not in a position to assist on the question\n                    of the intention of the Accused at the time the ligature was applied, he\n                    nevertheless said that he would not rule out that the Accused might have\n                    mistakenly applied the ligature around the Deceased’s neck when he had\n                    only intended to tie up the Deceased’s mouth. At this point, it must be\n                    emphasised that it was very clear from the evidence (in particular from the\n                    position of the knot being at the back of the Deceased’s neck) that when\n                    the Accused applied the ligature, the Accused was positioned at thebackof the Deceased, who waslying\n                        face downon the floor. It was not as if the Accused was lying\n                    with his face upwards when the Accused was tying the knot and the Accused could\n                    obviously see that he was not applying the ligature to the mouth but to the\n                    neck. 88     The Accused had, at several junctures,\n                    repeated that he had no intention to kill the Deceased and that when he left the\n                    flat, the Deceased was still alive (or so he thought). He also later admitted in\n                    his statement and in court that he had invented two fictional characters when he\n                    was interrogated because he was in a state of shock, fear and confusion. As\n                    contemplated by MPH Rubin J inPP v Sundarti\n                        Supriyanto[2004] 4 SLR(R) 622 at [144], to hold the\n                    falsified statements or lies out of court against the accused to corroborate his\n                    guilt or to discredit him as a witness would mean disregarding perfectly\n                    acceptable portions of his testimony in court. This would be a disproportionate\n                    reaction, especially in a trial where capital punishment was\n                involved. 89     It is also poignant to note that there are\n                    evidential gaps in the Prosecution’s case. The Prosecution is faced with\n                    the daunting task of proving that the Accused in fact had the intention to apply\n                    the ligaturearound the Deceased’s neck.\n                    That the ligature eventually ended up around the Deceased’s neck was\n                    supported by forensic evidence and that the Accused was the only person present\n                    at the scene was never disputed. However, the specific intent of the Accused in\n                    so applying and tying the ligature around the Deceased’s neck and not the\n                    mouth must still be proved by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable\n                doubt. 90     I find it compelling to note that the\n                    Deceased, when he exited the Deceased’s flat on the night of\n                        19June 2008, had left his blue canvas bag\n                    behind. If the Prosecution was correct in describing the Accused as a careful\n                    and meticulous murderer, his act of forgetting his blue bag would have been a\n                    devastating miscalculation on his part. If the Accused had intentionally tied\n                    the ligature around the Deceased’s neck thereby causing his death, it\n                    would be odd to find that having taken the Deceased’s jewellery to ensure\n                    that he would be financially secured for at least the next few days (if not\n                    weeks) thus giving him sufficient time to make his escape possibly out of\n                    Singapore, the Accused would be so perplexingly careless as to leave his\n                    belongings as a voluntary lead for police investigations to track him down.\n                    Leaving the bag behind also showed to some extent that he intended to return to\n                    the flat, which lends some weight to his evidence that he did not know at the\n                    time he left the flat that the Deceased had died. If he knew the Deceased had\n                    died, he probably would not have left his blue canvas bag behind. 91     Moreover, the act of pawning the\n                    Deceased’s gold bracelet (P154) at Tekka Enterprises on 20 June 2008\n                    at around 10.30 am using the Deceased’s identity card further lends\n                    credence to the Accused’s evidence that he did not know that the Deceased\n                    had passed away until he was informed by SSI Zainal Abidin. If the prosecution\n                    was right that the Accused had intended to tie the ligature around the\n                    Deceased’s neck and had thereby caused his death, it would be an act which\n                    baffles and defies common sense to use the Deceased’s identity card for\n                    transactional or even any purpose at all. The prosecution emphasised that the\n                    Accused was no simpleton and was wary not to use his passport to register for a\n                    room in Hotel 12, possibly for the avoidance of police detection. If this were\n                    the logic that had occupied the Accused’s mind after he left the\n                    Deceased’s flat, would it not be contradictory and futile to his efforts\n                    of self-preservation to use the Deceased’s identity card which would\n                    expose himself, sooner or later, to the authorities? 92     The Accused also had in his possession his\n                    Malaysian passport throughout the period when he left the Deceased’s flat\n                    up until his arrest. After he had pawned the Deceased’s gold bracelet\n                    (P154) raising a sum of $1,900, would it not have been the most prudent decision\n                    to leave Singapore immediately and escape the accompanying death penalty once\n                    and for all? His actions of lingering around the streets of Singapore, from\n                    pawning a gold chain with a key-shaped pendant (P167) for $150 at Tekka\n                    Enterprises, to later engaging the services of a prostitute on the 21 June\n                    2008, showed no intention to flee the country or even cover up his trail and are\n                    therefore at odds with the Prosecution’s case. 93     I now consider whether the Accused had\n                    intended to tie the ligature around the Deceased’s neck to strangle him in\n                    order to rob the Deceased of the jewelleries that the he was wearing at that\n                    time. Although motive is not to be equated withmens rea per\n                        se, motive can be a helpful instrument in pointing us to the\n                    right direction as to whether the requisitemens\n                        reafor the offence was in fact present. In my view, a motive of\n                    robbery on the Accused’s part would be highly unlikely. Given that the\n                    Deceased had always been obliging in respect of the Accused’s needs and\n                    requests for money, a fact substantiated by the evidence given by Taher and the\n                    Accused himself, the Accused could have just asked for more money from the\n                    Deceased rather than murder the Deceased in order to steal his gold bracelet,\n                    gold chain and hand phone. 94     It was held inJagatheesan\n                        s/o Krishnasamy v PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 45 at [61] that\n                    while the prosecution does not have to dispel all conceivable doubts, the\n                    doctrine that the prosecution bears the burden of proving its case beyond\n                    reasonable doubt mandates that, at the very least, those doubts for which there\n                    is a reason that is relatable to and supported by the evidence presented must be\n                    excluded so that no reasonable doubt remains. I am of view that the doubts\n                    raised above are not merely fanciful doubts but those which are reasonable. The\n                    lack of an ‘unbreakable and credible chain of evidence’ (in the\n                    words ofXP v PP[2008] 4 SLR(R) 686 at\n                    [98]) seem to indicate that there are decidedly reasonable doubts concerning the\n                    Accused’s intention in inflicting the ligature around the Deceased’s\n                    neck in order to strangle the Deceased to death. 95     Thus, following the approach inChan Kin ChoiandTan Chee\n                        Hwee, it would be prudent to take into account both incriminating\n                    and exculpating statements of the Accused, assigning them with appropriate\n                    weights as such, short of disregarding the exculpating/explanatory portions\n                    altogether. The Accused’s explanation that he did not intend to tie the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck and that he was of the belief that the\n                    Deceased was still alive seem to be, on balance of probabilities, truthful as it\n                    is corroborated by objective circumstantial evidence in the aforementioned [90]\n                    to [93]. In any case, at the very least I am of the view that there is a\n                    reasonable doubt as to whether the Accused had in fact intended to apply the\n                    ligature around the Deceased’s neck. I therefore find that the Prosecution\n                    has failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the act of tying the ligature\n                    around the Deceased’s neck was one that was intentional and not\n                    accidental. Accordingly, the Accused is not guilty of murder under\n                    section 300(c) of the Penal Code. 96     The Accused, however, at the point of\n                    application of the ligature, must have known that his act of tying the knot at\n                    the back of the Deceased’s head and tightening the ligature was likely to\n                    cause death given the proximity between the mouth and neck region. This inherent\n                    risk was elevated by the fact that the Deceased was lying face down. As the\n                    Deceased was in a prone position and was struggling when the ligature was\n                    applied, the Accused was not given a clear view of the exact position of the\n                    ligature beneath,ie, whether it was at the mouth,\n                    chin or neck area, at the time he tightened the ligature with a considerable\n                    amount of force whilst he was positioned at the back of the Deceased. As this\n                    was the case, the Accused is therefore guilty of culpable homicide not amounting\n                    to murder under section 299 and is therefore punishable under\n                    section 304(b) of the Penal Code: Punishment for culpable homicide not amounting to murder*304.Whoever commits culpable homicide\n                        not amounting to murder shall be punished — … (b) with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, or with\n                        fine, or with caning, or with any combination of such punishments, if the\n                        act is done with the knowledge that it is likely to cause death, but without\n                        any intention to cause death, or to cause such bodily injury as is likely to\n                        cause death",
        "Defence of Provocation": "97     Even if murder under section 300(c) were\n                    to be successfully proven by the Prosecution beyond a reasonable doubt, this\n                    court finds that the defence of provocation is made out on the evidence and the\n                    offence of murder must in any event be reduced to one of culpable homicide not\n                    amounting to murder under section 299 of the Penal Code. 98     The relationship between the Deceased and the\n                    Accused becomes critical in determining whether the defence of provocation would\n                    operate in this present case. If they were in fact lovers to the extent that the\n                    Accused had been regularly penetrating the anus of the Deceased, then perhaps I\n                    may not regard the alleged provocation,ie, the\n                    proposition for anal intercourse, as grave and sudden under the circumstances.\n                    It may not even amount to a provocation at all. 99     The prosecution maintained that the Accused\n                    and Deceased were in fact lovers. This was based on the oral testimonies of the\n                    Prosecution’s witnesses Taher, Aini and one Mr Seet Seng Hai\n                    (“Mr. Seet”) (PW20). However, the extent of their sexual\n                    relationship prior to the incident, in particular whether it included anal sex,\n                    was not clear from the evidence relied on by the Prosecution. 100    Taher had known the Deceased since 1978 and\n                    lived together since 1986. Their relationship was platonic and they were like\n                    siblings. It was Taher’s evidence that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    lovers. In fact, he himself was against their relationship as he suspected that\n                    the Accused was financially draining the Deceased. His conclusion that the two\n                    were lovers was based on the following observations: (a)The Deceased had expressed to Taher that he loved\n                            (“sayang”) the Accused;(b)He had seen the Deceased and Accused both leaning\n                            against the railing at an MRT station with their hands clasped together;\n                            and(c)The Deceased told Taher that he had pawned his\n                            jewellery and given the money to the Accused as he needed money to make\n                            a passport.101    Mr. Seet, on the other hand, was the\n                    Deceased’s supervisor/employer at Sengent Company. During\n                    cross-examination, Mr. Seet was asked whether the ‘lover’\n                    mentioned by the Deceased was in fact the Accused or possibly someone else. Mr\n                    Seet’s reply was the Deceased had told him that the lover was his\n                    ‘East Malaysian former employee’. In addition to that, the name\n                    ‘Astro’ was also mentioned.102    The Defence, on the other hand, denied any\n                    romantic relationship between the Deceased and the Accused. Instead, their\n                    relationship was akin to mother and son. The Accused had always felt beholden to\n                    the Deceased and described the Deceased as his ‘adopted family’ in\n                    Singapore.103    With regard to the evidence of the\n                    Prosecution witnesses that the Deceased and Accused were lovers, the Defence\n                    submitted that some Prosecution witnesses, especially Taher, lacked credibility.\n                    The Defence disputed Taher’s observations as mere personal assumptions.\n                    His dislike towards the Accused stemmed from his belief that the latter was\n                    taking advantage of the Deceased from the very moment the Deceased met the\n                    Accused.104    Most significantly, Taher’s evidence\n                    on the physical intimacy between the Deceased and Accused was inconsistent. In\n                    his evidence, Taher first said that he had never seen them kissing or holding\n                    hands and admitted that it was his assumption that they were lovers. However, in\n                    the latter part of his evidence, he then testified that he had witnessed them\n                    holding hands and leaning against the railing near the MRT\n                station.105    The Defence relied on the close-circuit\n                    television (“CCTV”) footage taken outside the SMRT Clubhouse\n                    (P156) which showed the Deceased and Accused leaving the premises of the\n                    clubhouse together. Notably, they were not walking next to each other. There\n                    was, in fact, quite a clear distance between them. The interaction between the\n                    two as captured by the CCTV suggested that the Deceased and the Accused were\n                    just friends and not lovers. This was also corroborated by the evidence of Sarah\n                    Binte Aman who had seen the two walking near the car park of their HDB flat and\n                    that their interaction seemed ‘normal’ without any exchange of\n                    romantic gestures.106    Aini’s evidence in relation to the\n                    Accused being the Deceased’s lover was speculative in the sense that she\n                    knew about the relationship from her aunt and Taher. This is hearsay. She\n                    herself was not able to confirm that the Deceased and the Accused shared a\n                    romantic relationship as a matter of fact. Although her adopted father admitted\n                    to being in a relationship with a man and had promised that he would break off\n                    the relationship, the identity of the man remained a mystery to\n                her.107    Witnesses who were told directly that the\n                    Deceased and the Accused were lovers were Taher and Mr. Seet. Mr. Seet\n                    had only heard from the Deceased that his lover was Astro but had never seen\n                    them in any intimate or romantic embrace. It was his evidence that before he was\n                    told about the romantic relationship, he once saw the Accused visit the Deceased\n                    at the SMRT Clubhouse and thought they were just friends. As for Taher, his\n                    evidence of the intimacy between the Deceased and Accused had been flickering\n                    and bordered on prejudice.108    The Accused’s sexual history as\n                    established in court revealed that since the age of 16, he had been involved in\n                    several romantic relationships with girls of his age. He only engaged in vaginal\n                    sex but never had anal sex with any of these girls. He also expressed his\n                    dislike and discomfort from unwanted attention that was showered upon him by\n                    homosexual men. I believe this evidence of the Accused. Thus, this court is\n                    inclined to find that, at the highest, this was a case of unrequited love on the\n                    part of the Deceased. This will not be too surprising if one were to look at the\n                    photographs of the Deceased and take into account the huge age difference\n                    between the Accused and the Deceased. From the totality of the evidence, I do\n                    not believe that the Accused and the Deceased had engaged in anal sex prior to\n                    the incident.109    The defence of provocation is encapsulated\n                    in Exception 1 to section 300 of the Penal Code:When culpable homicide is not\n                            murderException 1.—Culpable homicide is not murder if\n                        the offender whilst deprived of the power of self-control by grave and\n                        sudden provocation, causes the death of the person who gave the provocation,\n                        or causes the death of any other person by mistake or\n                        accident.…Explanation. —Whether the provocation\n                        was grave and sudden enough to prevent the offence from amounting to murder\n                        is a question of fact.110    Chao Hick Tin JA in the case ofSeah Kok Meng v PP[2001]\n                    2 SLR(R) 24 at [21] (“Seah Kok\n                        Meng”) (in turn citingPP v Kwan Cin\n                        Cheng[1998] 1 SLR(R) 434 andLau\n                        Lee Peng v PP[2000] 1 SLR(R) 448) held that there are\n                    two distinct requirements which must be satisfied before the defence of\n                    provocation can be successfully raised. First, is the subjective requirement\n                    that the accused was deprived of his self-control by provocation. Second, is the\n                    objective requirement that the provocation must have been “grave and\n                    sudden” which involved the application of the “reasonable\n                    man” test. The question involves considering whether an ordinary person\n                    of the same sex and age as the Accused, sharing such characteristics as would\n                    affect the gravity of the provocation and placed in the same situation, would\n                    have been so provoked as to lose his self-control.Actual Loss of Self-Control111    It was held inSeah Kok\n                        Mengthat the accused did not, in fact, lose his self-control due\n                    to provocation. The Court of Appeal was minded that after being informed by his\n                    girlfriend that she was molested by the victim, the accused had the presence of\n                    mind to do the only proper thing: to go there to “rescue” her. On\n                    arrival, there was no altercation although the victim was standing close by.\n                    After the accused asked his girlfriend to hang up the phone and leave, there was\n                    some staring between the accused and the victim whereupon the appellant went to\n                    the back lane and came back armed with a wooden stick. It opined that every move\n                    of the accused was very deliberate and that he knew what he wanted to do,ie, he found his implement and took the\n                    offensive against the victim, literally to teach the latter a\n                lesson.112    The Prosecution also relied heavily on the\n                    case ofLim Chin Chong v PP[1998]\n                    2 SLR(R) 278 (“Lim Chin\n                        Chong”) owing to the factual similarities with the present\n                    case. InLim Chin Chong, the appellant was a\n                    19 year old Malaysian who worked as a free lance male prostitute\n                    whereas the victim was his employer. After being propositioned for anal\n                    intercourse and forcefully kissed, the appellant killed the victim. The Court of\n                    Appeal found that on evidence, the subjective element had not been satisfied as\n                    the evidence showed beyond doubt that the appellant went about killing the\n                    deceased in a cool, calm and methodical way: after the accused had subdued the\n                    deceased with a punch on his nose, he went out of the room, found some\n                    electrical wire and tied the deceased’s arms and legs. The appellant also\n                    gagged the deceased who was lying in bed calling for help. He then left the room\n                    again and found a long wooden pestle in the kitchen which he decided to use to\n                    bludgeon the deceased. At this juncture, he was interrupted by the return of\n                    another male prostitute and his customer. The appellant calmly went to the\n                    bedroom door and told them that he and the deceased were having sexual\n                    intercourse and were not to be disturbed. These acts, in the court’s view,\n                    were not acts of a man who had lost control of himself and was in a frenzy. They\n                    were calculated and premeditated acts.113    It was the Defence’s case that the\n                    court should take into account the level of intoxication of the Accused on the\n                    night of 19 June 2008. Although the Accused had admitted to\n                    Dr. Kenneth Koh (“Dr. Koh”) (PW 27) that he usually\n                    drinks 6 bottles of alcohol over a day, the Accused’s evidence was he had\n                    consumed 2 ? bottles of alcohol within a span of 3 hours on\n                    the night of the incident. During cross-examination, the Accused testified that\n                    the maximum amount of bottles of alcohol that he could take ‘in one\n                    go’ was 2 to 3 bottles and that after 2 bottles, he would be half-drunk\n                    and would not be able to perform his normal functions.114    Thus, the defence submitted that as a result\n                    of this, the Accused was not able to retain his self-control when the Deceased\n                    repeatedly blackmailed him and insisted on having anal sex:Q:    Now, why did you punch him, Mr. Astro? Why did\n                            you have to punch him? As his Honour said earlier, when you pushed him,\n                            he fell into the cupboard, you had the chance, just leave. Why did you\n                            have to punch him? Understand the question?…A:    At that time, I was very angry and he kept\n                            on…If I were normal then --- then I wouldn’t do all\n                            these.Court:    If what, sorry? If?Witness: If I were normal then, then I would not have done all these, your\n                        Honour.Q:    What --- What do you mean by if you were normal?\n                            Were you not normal then?A:    Okay, if I were --- if I hadn’t consumed\n                            alcohol or if I were normal --- if I were in a normal situation then\n                            I’ll --- I’ll --- the approach that I would take would be to\n                            talk to him. Talk to this --- the deceased…because I had drunk\n                            alcohol, so I was not able to control my anger --- and I was --- as well\n                            as myself. And I found that I became angry pretty fast because of the\n                            alcohol consumption as well. Now that when I think about what happened,\n                            your Honour, I’m also puzzled why I was not able to control my\n                            anger because prior to the 19th, he had in\n                            fact also touched me but I was able to control myself and not get angry\n                            with him, to be patient. But I don’t know what made me lose my\n                            control on the 19th, that resulted in all\n                            this tragedy, your Honour.115    The Prosecution, on the other hand,\n                    submitted that the Accused’s acts suggested that he was not half-conscious\n                    or drunk as he had claimed,ie, his evidence which\n                    downplayed his sobriety was contradicted by his actions which demonstrated that\n                    his mental faculties were functional and were not affected by alcohol:(a)After rejecting the Accused’s proposition\n                            for anal sex, the Accused could stand up, pull up his boxers, push the\n                            Deceased’s hand away and take his jeans from the bedroom door and\n                            put it on;(b)When the Deceased was groaning on the floor, the\n                            Accused still had the presence of mind to think of a way to silence the\n                            Deceased in order to prevent the Deceased from calling the police;\n                            and(c)The following evidence revealed that immediately\n                            after the scuffle and tying up of the Deceased, the Accused was still\n                            capable of acting in a methodical manner:(i)Ishak and Aini had given evidence that\n                                    the Deceased’s bed was well-tucked when they entered the\n                                    room. If a scuffle had taken place as the Accused had alleged,\n                                    the bed would, in all probability, be in a mess. This showed\n                                    that the Accused had tidied up the room before leaving the\n                                    flat;(ii)Ishak and Aini testified that the body\n                                    was well hidden under a stack of pillows, cushions and blanket.\n                                    This evidence was corroborated by the paramedic’s\n                                    evidence, Sgt Nasir, who was unable to see the Deceased’s\n                                    body when he entered the room and had to ask twice for\n                                    directions before he could locate the body. The prosecution\n                                    submitted that if the Accused had the presence of mind to tidy\n                                    the bed and put all clothes in place, it is unlikely that he had\n                                    covered the body accidentally;(iii)According to the Accused, he finished\n                                    drinking at about 9.30 pm and by 10 pm, he had already\n                                    left the flat. Hence, the time span for which the scuffle\n                                    happened up to the point the Deceased was left tied up in the\n                                    room was approximately 30 minutes. The fact that everything had\n                                    happened so rapidly indicated that the Accused had reacted\n                                    swiftly and acted speedily. This would not have been possible if\n                                    the Accused was half-conscious or half-drunk; and(iv)After arriving in Geylang, the Accused\n                                    who had his passport with him was mindful not to use his own\n                                    passport to register for a hotel room. Instead, he managed to\n                                    talk one Lawrence Anak Nyuak, into registering the room under\n                                    the other’s name.In light of the above evidence, the Prosecution submitted that the\n                    Accused was not drunk, or even half-drunk as he had claimed, but was fully\n                    conscious of all his actions at the time of incident.Effect of intoxication on the subjective assessment of loss of\n                self-control116    In the case ofSeah Kok\n                        Meng, the court did not take into account the level of\n                    intoxication of the accused in its consideration of whether the accused had lost\n                    his self-control. However, I find that the facts inSeah Kok\n                        Mengare different from the present case. The accused inSeah Kok Menghad committed murder some seven\n                    hours after drinking. The Accused in the instant case was, on the other hand,\n                    inebriated in the sense that prior to the scuffle, he had just finished a bottle\n                    of Guinness Stout. The Prosecution further tendered its argument that even if\n                    the Accused had lost his self-control, in between the scuffle to his fleeing\n                    from the flat, he in fact regained self-control.117    I note that counsel has not cited any\n                    authorities that dealt directly with the issue of whether the effects (if any)\n                    of intoxication may be taken into account as a factor in determining the\n                    Accused’s loss of self-control when a Defence of provocation is raised to\n                    a murder charge. InPP v Tharema Vejayan s/o\n                        Govindasamy[2009] SGHC 144, the two expert witnesses\n                    engaged by the prosecution and defence respectively were in agreement that the\n                    accused was intoxicated. Their disagreement was over whether the accused was so\n                    intoxicated that he was unable to form the requisite intention for the\n                    commission of the offence. However, when it came to the assessment of whether\n                    the accused actually lost self-control, the court was silent on the point of\n                    intoxication or the effects thereof.118    There are significant authorities which have\n                    been and still are being raised by various courts across the Commonwealth in\n                    relation to the effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation. Lord Goff\n                    in the case ofR v Morhall [1995]\n                        3 WLR 330(House of Lords) at page 337 held that a\n                    diminished capacity for self-control arising from drunkenness (as an altered\n                    mental state affecting capacity for control) is an attribute that is not\n                    properly imputable to the reasonable person based on the general policy not to\n                    allow such an accused person to benefit from voluntary intoxication by drink or\n                    drug.119    This court takes the view that thesubjective assessmentof whether the accused lost his\n                    self-control is essentially a finding of fact. Such a finding of fact would only\n                    adhere to and reflect reality if the accused’s state of intoxication (or\n                    lack thereof) is taken into account. Any concern that an intoxicated man would\n                    be able to exonerate himself from an offencesolelybecause he was intoxicated could be alleviated as\n                    intoxication, at this stage, is taken asone of the\n                        factorsin determining whether he was in fact deprived of his\n                    self-control. A finding of intoxication does not automatically in itself warrant\n                    the operation of the defence of provocation, bearing in mind the need for the\n                    semi-objective test that has to be satisfied for this defence as a whole. SeeSeah Kok Meng.120    Moreover, taking into account the state of\n                    intoxication of an accused in thesubjective\n                        determinationof loss of self-control would not detract from\n                    public policy in ensuring that no one, by his own volition of taking\n                    intoxicating substances (ie, drink or drug) could\n                    be excused of his lack of self-restraint, short of being completely incapable of\n                    controlling himself. It is important to note that the accused’s state of\n                    intoxication is not attributed to the reasonable man. Hence, the reasonable man\n                    is one who is of the same age and sex of the accused, who shares the peculiar\n                    characteristics (which form the subject of provocation) as the accused but is\n                    one who is sober. The effect of intoxication on the defence of provocation\n                    relates only to the subjective element and the assessment of its effect should\n                    be determined on a case-by case basis, depending on the factual matrix of each\n                    case.121    Notably, the Canadian courts have been\n                    applying the aforementioned approach. In the case ofWright v\n                        The Queen[1969] S.C.R 335, Fauteux J held\n                    that in determining whether the accused acted actually upon the provocation\n                    (applying a subjective test), the character, background, temperament,\n                    idiosyncrasies or the drunkenness of the accused are matters to be considered.\n                    However, they are excluded from the objective test as to hold otherwise would\n                    denude of any sense the objective test. I agree with this\n                approach.122    Social consumption of alcohol is almost\n                    universal in many societies. The physiological and psychological effects of\n                    alcohol vary from one individual to another. It is regrettable that this court\n                    is not assisted by any expert opinion on this matter pertaining to the effect of\n                    alcohol on a person’s level of self-control and more particularly, whether\n                    the Accused had indeed lost his self-control on that day, having regard to his\n                    physical condition and ability to hold alcohol. This is especially so given that\n                    he had actually consumed a fairly large quantity of alcohol, which was not long\n                    before the scuffle and the subsequent application of the ligature. Even in the\n                    absence of expert opinion, this court, however, finds it proper to take into\n                    account and consider with some weight the effect of alcohol as another factor in\n                    thesubjective determinationof whether or not the\n                    Accused had in fact lost his self-control. I cannot disregard the oral testimony\n                    of the Accused that he had drunk alcohol and so he was not able to control his\n                    anger as well as himself, and that he had become angry pretty fast because of\n                    his alcohol consumption. I find that this part of the Accused’s oral\n                    testimony on the effect of alcohol on his ability to control himself (viewed\n                    subjectively) is not something fanciful but evidence that I do give some weight\n                    to. The Prosecution wisely did not challenge this evidence on the basis that\n                    alcohol has absolutely no effect on a person’s ability to control himself\n                    as it is common knowledge that it does have some effect, a fact which I can take\n                    judicial notice of even in the absence of expert evidence.123    As MPH Rubin J inSundarti Supriyantoat [154] observed:It cannot be said that a particular trait or pattern of behaviourmustbe observed on the part of the\n                        accused post-killing, in order to determine whether she had lost her\n                        self-control during the time of killing. Different people react differently\n                        in different situations. This is why the test pertaining to whether an\n                        accused had lost his/her self-control was made subjective. For instance, the\n                        actions of the killer post-killing inPP v Kwan Cin\n                            Chengdiffered from the actions of the killer inLau Lee Peng v PP. Everything depended on the facts\n                        of the individual case.A general submission that the\n                            calmness of an accused post-killing meant that she must have been calm\n                            throughout the time of killing was not convincing.[emphasis in italics in original, emphasis in bold and italics\n                        added]Although the prosecution highlighted the fact that the Accused was\n                    likely to have tidied up the bed prior to leaving the room, this does not in\n                    itself warrant an inference that the Accused had, throughout the alleged crime,\n                    acted under a clear state of mind. The Accused’s acts (by his own\n                    admission and supported by Aini and Ishak’s evidence) of hastily throwing\n                    some clothing back into the wardrobe and some in the direction where the Accused\n                    was tied up before he left the flat were in contradiction with those of a person\n                    who was sober enough to clean up the aftermath of his crime.124    This court is therefore inclined to find, on\n                    a balance of probabilities, that on the facts of the case the Accused had lost\n                    his self-control. In contrast with the accused persons inSeah Kok MengandLim Chin Chong,\n                    the time lapse between the scuffle and the Accused’s fleeing the flat was\n                    relatively short,ie, an approximate 30 minutes.\n                    Thus it could be inferred that the Accused’s acts were committed in a\n                    state of frenzy without pre-meditation or any cooling-off period. The appellant\n                    inLim Chin Chongwas found not to have his lost\n                    self-control as he had ample time to search for a deadly weapon and even present\n                    himself in a cool and calm manner in the face of queries by the suspecting male\n                    prostitute who ‘interrupted’ his slaying of the victim. Thus the\n                    factual circumstances betweenLim ChinChong and\n                    the present case are quite different.Sudden and Grave Provocation125    The Court of Appeal inLim Chin Chongalso did not find that the provocation was grave\n                    and sudden. The alleged provocation was the deceased propositioning the\n                    appellant to engage in anal intercourse and pulling the appellant onto the bed\n                    and kissing him. There was also the threat of setting secret society members\n                    onto the appellant. The court at [31] found that the propositioning and the\n                    kissing taken together could hardly be said to be provocative or was so\n                    disgusting and abhorrent as to have aroused revulsion in a person who, on his\n                    own admission, made a living by prostituting himself to other men even if he was\n                    to be believed that his service did not include kissing or anal\n                    intercourse.126    If it did, then the immediate and\n                    spontaneous reaction was the punch on the nose which immobilised the deceased to\n                    such an extent that appellant was able to leave the room, find the electrical\n                    wire and return to tie the deceased and gag him. The court inLim Chin Chongopined that on any objective test the provocation\n                    of being sodomised had simplyevaporatedand the\n                    threat of being got at by secret members was just a hollow threat. Thus, the\n                    Court of Appeal was of view that there was no grave and sudden provocation which\n                    posed an immediate threat to the appellant.127    The Defence submitted that the\n                    Deceased’s proposition for anal sex and taunt about how the Accused was\n                    being ‘cultivated’ by the Deceased all the while amounted to grave\n                    and sudden provocation.128    In determining whether there was\n                    ‘sudden’ provocation, the Defence submitted that an analogy should\n                    be drawn with the case ofSundarti Supriyantowhereby a series of abuse with no break in time that provided the accused with a\n                    cooling off period was found to satisfy the requirement of suddenness. See [155]\n                    to [165].129    The Accused had allegedly been suffering\n                    from a ‘series of abuse’, as coined by the Defence. The\n                    ‘series of abuse’ took the form of caressing and touching by the\n                    Deceased. It was the Accused’s evidence that from the first time he stayed\n                    at the Deceased flat (sometime around November 2007), the Deceased had started\n                    caressing him when they were in bed. The series of touching became more serious\n                    when the Deceased started to grope the Accused’s buttocks on the\n                    18 June 2008. The Accused, although growing increasingly uncomfortable with\n                    these touching, protested in silence as he did not want to offend the Deceased,\n                    his sole source of dependence in Singapore.130    The Accused testified that on the night of\n                    19 June 2008, he had ‘given up his dignity’ and allowed the\n                    Deceased to perform fellatio on him. Thus, the account of events, from the\n                    touching and caressing up to the point of fellatio should be viewed as part of\n                    an ongoing process in the context of provocation. When the Deceased further\n                    requested for anal sex and taunted the Accused for being\n                    ‘cultivated’ by him, the Accused having earlier succumbed to the\n                    Deceased’s harassment, had had enough and I accept that the Accused\n                    suddenly erupted in rage and lost control of himself.131    The Prosecution further submitted that\n                    during the scuffle, there were moments when the Accused had time to leave the\n                    flat. When the Deceased was lying on the floor groaning in pain, the\n                    ‘provocation’ (if any) had evaporated. The Defence, on the other\n                    hand, submitted that the scuffle and incidents between the Deceased and Accused\n                    were part and parcel of an ongoing process.132    Although there was an estimated time lapse\n                    of 30 seconds when the Accused just stared at the Deceased who was lying on the\n                    floor, it would be artificial in my view to carve up the time frame into\n                    intervals of seconds and analyse them rationally. One should be mindful not to\n                    expect a man who had acted in the heat of passion to be able to weigh the golden\n                    scales of reaction as one can in a calm court room. The relatively short\n                    interval between the act of fellatio to the scuffle indicates to me a lack of\n                    cooling-off period. Moreover, there was no evidence of any premeditation on the\n                    part of the Accused. Hence, objectively assessed, the requirement of suddenness\n                    is satisfied.133    As to whether a proposition of anal sex was\n                    ‘grave’, it was found inDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 that the deceased’s acts of committing buggery\n                    and later taunting at the accused, a 15 year old boy, was sufficiently grave\n                    provocation.134    In the Australian case ofGreen v R[1997] 148 ALR 659 the accused had been\n                    drinking one night with the deceased who was some twenty years older than him,\n                    but whom he viewed as a long-standing and trusted friend. The deceased made a\n                    sexual advance which the accused brushed off, saying that he was not interested.\n                    The accused then went to bed but was followed by the deceased who came into his\n                    room naked, got into bed with him, grabbed hold of the accused and touched his\n                    groin. The accused responded by repeatedly punching the deceased approximately\n                    fifteen times, stabbing him ten times with scissors and banging the\n                    deceased’s head into the bedroom wall.135    On appeal, Brennan CJ, sitting in the\n                    Australian High Court (in a 3:2 decision) held that the ‘real sting’\n                    of the provocation lay in the deceased’s attempts to ‘violate the\n                    sexual integrity of a man who had trusted him as a friend and a father\n                    figure’ and also in ‘his persistent homosexual\n                    advances’.136    The classic justification for the existence\n                    of the provocation defence is that it provides a concession to human frailty.\n                    The extension of this defence to ‘non-violent homosexual advances’\n                    as per the instant case would rest in the recognition of the fact that most\n                    heterosexual men would view such homosexual advances as sufficiently\n                    provocative. The more intrusive the advances, the more grave and provocative\n                    they would be.137    The Accused in the instant case was\n                    outraged, disappointed and sickened by the Deceased’s proposition for anal\n                    intercourse as it was disgusting to him. The Accused found it inconceivable to\n                    engage in anal intercourse, even with women, and described the act as ‘a\n                    dirty channel’ due to its unhygienic nature. Objectively viewed, an\n                    unwanted proposition for anal intercourse in the circumstances of this case does\n                    amount to a grave provocation.138    In his examination-in-chief, the Accused\n                    expressed his despair when the Deceased reminded him of all the good deeds he\n                    had done for the Accused and that he had secured a roof over the Accused’s\n                    head. The case ofDPP v Camplin[1978] A.C. 705 at 726 noted that:The effect of an insult will often depend entirely on a characteristic of\n                        the person to whom the insult is directed. ‘Dirty nigger’ would\n                        probably mean little if said to a white man or even if said by one coloured\n                        man to another; but it is obviously more insulting when said by a white man\n                        to a coloured man.As Jeremy Horder inProvocation and\n                        Responsibility(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1992) at page 138\n                    pointed out:[A]t the root ofprovokedanger, which is\n                        different from exasperation or frustration, lies moral evaluation and\n                        judgment. The judgment is one of moral wrongdoing by another that is\n                        experienced as demeaning or potentially demeaning to oneself, as involving a\n                        lowering or potential lowering of one’s self-respect or self-esteem.\n                        In the wake of this judgment of wrongdoing may flow the familiar sensation\n                        of the heating of the blood and the desire (not necessarily acted on) to\n                        retaliate.Thus, the Deceased’s emotional\n                    blackmail translated the Accused’s subservience into anger and outrage.\n                    Such a taunt on the Accused’s financial and even livelihood dependence on\n                    the Deceased was arguably the sting of the provocation which had added to the\n                    gravity of it.139    This court therefore finds, on balance of\n                    probabilities, that the Accused had lost his self-control in the face of a\n                    sudden and grave provocation and that he had applied the ligature while still\n                    being deprived of his power of self-control.Defence of Sudden Fight140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code:Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner.141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are:(a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148. Worth noting is that the wording of Exception 4 states “a\n                    sudden fight in the heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel”. As such, this\n                    clearly indicates that it must have been the intention of Legislature that\n                    “fight” must mean something more than just a mere\n                quarrel.143    There cannot be a fight if the victim keeps\n                    quiet and does nothing as that is simply a one-sided attack. SeeTan Chee Weeat [61]. InTan Chee\n                        Wee, the appellant had struck the deceased on the head with a\n                    hammer. It was doubtful that this attack could be regarded as a fight as there\n                    was no evidence that there was an exchange of blows even though the attack had\n                    supposedly arisen after the victim had grabbed a knife.144    The forensic evidence before this court\n                    suggests that there is a lack of fight between the Deceased and Accused. It was\n                    A/P Gilbert Lau’s observation that there were no typical defensive\n                    injuries found on the Deceased’s body.145    The Defence suggested that the congealed\n                    blood found on the floor beneath the Deceased’s head had resulted from an\n                    injury caused by the scuffle, in the form of abrasion, to the lips or face. A/P\n                    Gilbert Lau’s reply was that although he was unable to exclude that\n                    possibility entirely, he was of view that it was very unlikely for the following\n                    reasons:(a)An abrasion would not have caused much bleeding.\n                            The amount of bleeding (as seen in photograph P44) would have been\n                            caused by a laceration.

However, I made a finding in[96]above that Accused is guilty of the offence of culpable homicide under\n                    section 299 of the Penal Code.

        "Defence of Sudden Fight": "140    The Defence also sought to rely on Exception\n                    4 to section 300 of the Penal Code: Exception 4.—Culpable homicide is not\n                        murder if it is committed without premeditation in a sudden fight in the\n                        heat of passion upon a sudden quarrel, and without the offender having taken\n                        undue advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual manner. 141    The three requirements to be met for the\n                    defence to operate are: (a)There was a sudden fight in the heat of passion\n                            upon a sudden quarrel;(b)There was an absence of pre-meditation by the\n                            accused; and(c)The accused did not take undue advantage or act\n                            in a cruel or unusual manner.142    The case ofTan Chee\n                        Weeat [60] held that the word “fight” implies\n                    mutual provocation and blows on each side. It is not sufficient merely for there\n                    to be “an offer of violence on both sides” in the words of the\n                    court inJusab Usman v State[1983] XXIV Guj\n                    LR 1148.
