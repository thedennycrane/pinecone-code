        "Conclusion": "18     For the above reasons, I was of the view that the appellant could not rely on s 114 of the Act to invalidate the evidence that he is the biological father of the Child and therefore the finding of fact by the District Judge that he is so stands. He must therefore abide by his duty to maintain the Child under s 68 and s 69 of the Charter. Apparently the appellant had gotten married, making it rather awkward for him to have to maintain a child that he had sired by another woman. Nevertheless the law requires – and I should add society expects – that he undertakes some responsibility for his issue."
