        "THE THREE PROPERTIES: CHESTERS, HENSMAN AND MURDOCH": "3.    The District Court granted the Wife 60% of\n\neach of the above three properties Chesters, Hensman and Murdoch in Australia and the\n\nHusband 40% . The reason for this is stated in para 26 of the Grounds of Decision\n\n(‘GD’):‘26 This was a marriage of 16 years. For 9 years\n\n  until 1993, both parties worked full time and they pooled their resources. They operated a\n\n  joint account. They made many joint purchases of assets. After 1993, only the husband was\n\n  working. The wife took care of the home. For a number of years, she alone took care of the\n\n  children in Australia as the husband was working in Singapore. Parties also had the\n\n  assistance of the wife’s family. The indirect contribution of the wife had to be\n\n  given due recognition. All except two of the properties they bought were in joint names.\n\n  Even for the properties in the sole name of the husband, a substantial portion of the\n\n  repayments were made through rentals earned from the properties. The wife, being\n\n  physically in Australia, was managing and maintaining the properties. I also attributed\n\n  the financial assistance obtained by the wife from her family members as her contributions\n\n  to the family. In respect of the financial and non-financial contributions, it would be an\n\n  appropriate case for equal division, whether or not the assets were paid by the wife or\n\n  the husband and whether or not they were in joint or sole name. However, the wife had to\n\n  provide not only for her but also a roof for the three children. I therefore felt it fair\n\n  that she be given a 10% premium in the division in respect of the three real properties in\n\n  Australia.’4.    Mr M P Rai, Counsel for the Husband,\n\nsubmitted that the Husband did not dispute that the matrimonial assets should be divided\n\nequally between the Husband and Wife. However, he submitted that the District Court erred\n\nin granting the Wife a further 10% of the three properties. The Wife’s indirect\n\ncontributions had already been taken into account in reaching an equal apportionment. To\n\ngrant a further 10% was a duplication. The interest of the children of the marriage could\n\nbe met by ordering a transfer of one property to the Wife, upon her paying the\n\nHusband’s share, which was in fact ordered. There was no reason for the division of\n\nall three properties to be affected.5.    Mr Palakrishnan SC, Counsel for the Wife, submitted\n\nthat under s 112(2)(c) Women’s Charter, the District Court was entitled to take into\n\naccount the needs of the children in the division of matrimonial assets. He submitted that\n\nin arriving at the equal division initially, the District Court had taken into account the\n\npast non-financial contributions of the Wife whereas the further 10% was to take into\n\naccount the future needs of the children. There was no duplication.6.    He also relied on a lecture given by Justice\n\nPrakash at the Eighth Singapore Law Review Lecture to support his submission.THE WIFE’S ENTITLEMENT TO S$187,000 IN THE\n\nHUSBAND’S CPF ACCOUNT7.    Aside from the three properties, the District Court\n\ndivided the rest of the matrimonial assets equally, between the Husband and the Wife as\n\nstated in para 26 of the GD which I have cited above.8.    As each of the parties had monies in his/her\n\naccount with the Central Provident Fund (‘CPF’), the District Court divided\n\nthese monies equally and found that the Husband had $187,000 more than the Wife in his CPF\n\naccount.9.    Paragraph 29 of the GD states:‘29 …. For the CPF funds, I\n\n  divided the entire balance of both parties in the ordinary, special and medisave account\n\n  equally. As a result, there was an amount of $187,000 which the husband had in (sic)\n\n  access of the wife and I accordingly ordered that this amount be charged against the\n\n  husband’s monies in his CPF ordinary account as the wife’s share of his CPF\n\n  assets. The usual CPF standard clauses on the charge was incorporated.’10.    However, as it turned out, these two\n\nsentences were not accurate.11.    First, the District Court took into account not\n\nonly the balance in the respective CPF accounts of the parties. It had also taken into\n\naccount the Wife’s shares which had been bought with monies from her CPF account. The\n\ndetails were as follows:The WifeThe HusbandShares (CPF investment account)S$ 99,117Monies in CPF accountS$132,000 (ordinary)S$563,000 (ordinary)S$ 14,725 (special)S$ 35,000 (special)S$ 10,532 (medisave)S$ 24,000 (medisave)S$265,374S$622,00012.    Secondly, the Husband’s excess was\n\nS$182,813, say S$182,000, and not S$187,000. This was conceded by Mr Palakrishnan.13.    Having said that, I note that the GD had also\n\nlisted some monies in the Wife’s bank accounts and the Husband’s. The Husband\n\nhad slightly more i.e between S$2,000 to S$2,500 more, depending on the exchange rate of\n\nsome of the foreign currencies in the Husband’s bank accounts. However, this could\n\nnot account for the difference of $5,000 between $187,000 and $182,000. Besides, the\n\nDistrict Court did not say it had taken the monies in the bank accounts into\n\nconsideration. It may also be that the $187,000 figure was a typographical error and\n\nshould have read $182,000 instead.14.    Accordingly, the $187,000 granted to the Wife\n\nshould be amended to $182,000.15.    Besides this point, Mr Rai submitted that the\n\npre-marital balance in the Husband’s CPF account should not have been taken into\n\naccount as matrimonial assets. For this purpose, he relied onLam Chih Kian v Ong Chin\n\nNgoh[1993] 2 SLR 253. However, there was no evidence about the pre-marital balance in\n\nthe Husband’s CPF account and Mr Rai sought leave to adduce fresh evidence in respect\n\nof that balance.16.    Mr Rai also submitted that monies in CPF accounts\n\nshould be treated differently from other matrimonial assets because such monies were\n\nforced savings meant for retirement. Accordingly, he submitted that there should not be an\n\nequal division of the combined monies in the CPF accounts but rather that the Wife should\n\nbe entitled to 30% only. For this point, Mr Rai relied on an unreported judgment of\n\nPrakash J in Divorce Petition No 1147 of 1995,Yah Cheng Huat v Ong Bee Lanin\n\nwhich the wife was granted 30% of the combined monies in the CPF accounts. However, he\n\naccepted that there were other High Court cases in which the wife was granted 50% of such\n\nmonies.17.    Mr Palakrishnan objected to fresh evidence being\n\nadmitted in respect of the Husband’s pre-marital balance in his CPF account. He\n\nstressed that there was a long history of litigation on the present disputes. The Husband\n\ndid not raise this point at the first hearing before the District Court on 2 July 2001. It\n\nwas only at the adjourned hearing of 4 July 2001, when the District Court was about to\n\ngive its decision, that the Husband’s Counsel applied to adduce such fresh evidence\n\nand seek an adjournment. This was refused by the District Court.18.    In addition, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that the\n\nadditional evidence would not be material as there was a difference between the old s 106\n\nWomen’s Charter and the current s 112 Women’s Charter.19.    The current s 112(10) Women’s Charter states:‘(10)For\n\n  the purposes of this section, \"matrimonial asset\" means -(a) any asset acquired before the marriage by one party or both parties\n\n    to the marriage -(i) ordinarily used or enjoyed by both parties or one or more of their\n\n      children while the parties are residing together for shelter or transportation or for\n\n      household, education, recreational, social or aesthetic purposes; or(ii) which has been substantially improved during the marriage by the\n\n      other party or by both parties to the marriage; and(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one\n\n    party or both parties to the marriage,but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has\n\n  been acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been\n\n  substantially improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to the\n\n  marriage.’Section 112(10)(a)(i) is new while s 112(10)(a)(ii) is\n\nsimilar, but not identical, to the old s 106(5).20.    It was submitted for the Wife that the\n\nparties’ monies in their respective CPF accounts had been used to buy an apartment in\n\nDairy Farm estate in Singapore. Subsequently, that property was sold at a profit and the\n\nmonies withdrawn from the CPF accounts were paid back into those accounts. Accordingly the\n\nHusband’s pre-marital CPF monies would still constitute matrimonial assets under s\n\n112(10)(a)(i).21.    As regards the question whether monies in\n\nCPF accounts should be treated differently, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that theYah\n\nCheng Huatcase was decided under the old s 106 Women’s Charter and in particular\n\ns 106(1), (3) and (4). Under that regime, where the matrimonial asset is obtained through\n\nthe sole effort of one of the parties, the court should be inclined towards giving that\n\nparty a greater proportion (see the old s 106(4)). However, under the current and\n\napplicable s 112 Women’s Charter, this inclination was done away with. He also relied\n\non the case ofYow Mee Lan v Chen Kai Buan[2000] 4 SLR 466in which this amendment\n\nwas explained by Prakash J herself. At para 30 of the judgment in that case, Prakash J\n\nsaid:‘30 The enactment of s 112 in 1996 removed the\n\n  dichotomy which the previous legislation had contained: the difference in approach to the\n\n  division of assets that had been acquired by the joint efforts of the parties from the\n\n  approach taken to the division of those that had been acquired by the sole efforts of one\n\n  of them. In the context of the famous and often analysed s 106, the efforts that resulted\n\n  in any particular asset falling into one category or the other were financial efforts only\n\n  and when it was established that only one party had financed an acquisition, the court had\n\n  to give that party a greater share in that asset. On the other hand, when assets had been\n\n  acquired by joint efforts, the court had a freer hand in dividing them though there was a\n\n  suggestion that the court should divide them equally.’",
        "WIFE’S ASSETS WHICH WERE NOT TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BY\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT": "22.    Mr Rai submitted that the District Court\n\nomitted to take into account some of the Wife’s assets in the division of matrimonial\n\nassets:(a) An insurance policy valued at S$110,000.(b) Her Australian shares valued at A$19,568.(c) Her jewellery valued at S$4,000.23.    Mr Palakrishnan accepted that the\n\nWife’s insurance policy was not mentioned in the GD. However, he pointed out that its\n\nmaturity date is May 2060. The Wife’s Australian shares were also not mentioned in\n\nthe GD but her jewellery was mentioned at para 20. He submitted that the Australian shares\n\nshould not be taken into account as they were for the benefit of the children and the\n\namount was negligible.",
        "FURNITURE": "24.    Mr Rai submitted that the Husband should be\n\ngranted half of the value of the furniture in the property at Chesters Way. This was\n\nvalued at A$40,000 by the Husband.25.    In my view, this claim was a non-starter.\n\nThe Wife had offered the furniture to the Husband save for a piano which she had purchased\n\nfor A$5,000. The Husband did not take up the offer and Mr Rai confirmed to me that the\n\nHusband did not want the physical furniture but the cash instead.26.    In the circumstances, I am of the view that\n\nthe Husband should not be granted anything for the furniture and the Wife is entitled to\n\nkeep it and deal with it as she wishes.",
        "MAINTENANCE: (A) FOR THE THREE CHILDREN AND (B) THE LUMP\n\nSUM FOR THE WIFE": "27.    Mr Rai said that the aggregate of S$6,500\n\nper month maintenance for the children (S$4,500) and the Wife (S$2,000) was initially\n\nordered on 30 August 2000 as interim maintenance pending the hearing of the ancillaries.\n\nAt that time, the Husband was employed by a Singapore company Cisco Systems (USA) Pte Ltd.\n\nAlthough this is a Singapore company, I will refer to it as ‘Cisco USA’ which is\n\nthe description used by the District Court. The Husband’s basic salary was S$170,000\n\nper annum. However, the Husband was posted to Sydney to work for Cisco Systems Australia\n\nPty Ltd (‘Cisco Australia’) with effect from 1 January 2001 and his annual\n\nsalary was reduced to A$155,000 per annum. Moreover, even that employment was terminated\n\neffective 16 March 2001 before the District Court’s decision on 4 July 2001. The\n\nHusband said he could not get a job since and he exhibited a few letters from prospective\n\nemployers in Australia to support his contention. He was still unemployed as at the date\n\nof the hearing before the District Court.28.    The District Court had this to say about\n\nthe change of employment at the beginning of 2001 and the termination on 16 March 2001\n\n(see paras 31, 36 to 38, 41 and 42 of the GD):‘31 The husband was working as a Training Manager\n\n  with Cisco when the proceedings started. Before January 2001, he worked in Singapore with\n\n  Cisco USA. In January 2001, he moved to Sydney to work with Cisco Australia. There was\n\n  however no formal contract between him and Cisco Australia and the document produced by\n\n  him to prove his income with Cisco Australia was issued by Cisco USA. On 16 March 2001,\n\n  his employment with Cisco Australia was terminated. No reason was given for the\n\n  termination. The husband’s counsel informed the wife’s counsel of the\n\n  husband’s termination of employment only in May 2001. The letter exhibited as\n\n  evidence of the termination was not a termination letter given to the husband but a letter\n\n  dated 22 May 2001 addressed to \"whom it may concern\". At the time of hearing, he\n\n  had not found another job despite make various applications.36 The wife’s counsel submitted that the circumstances of the\n\n  change and the subsequent termination of his employment were highly suspect. There was no\n\n  formal contract between him and Cisco Australia while there was a very comprehensive\n\n  contract with Cisco USA. The attachment of earnings order took effect from October but he\n\n  changed employer in January 2001. The termination of employment with Cisco Australia took\n\n  effect from 16 March 2001 but notice was not given to the wife’s counsel until May\n\n  2001 and this was after a court hearing in May 2001 ordering him to produce letters from\n\n  Cisco USA and Cisco Australia on his entire remuneration package. The wife also pointed\n\n  out that as late as February 2001, he still had the use of an American Express Corporate\n\n  card from Cisco USA as shown by the credit card statement exhibited. The husband’s\n\n  third affidavit was signed on 16 March 2001, the alleged day his service was terminated\n\n  and that affidavit mentioned nothing about the termination of his employment.37 I agreed with the wife that the circumstances concerning the\n\n  husband’s employment status were suspicious.38 The husband also blamed the wife for not getting employment in\n\n  Australia and said that the wife could easily get a job because she was a graduate and\n\n  qualified. However, at the same time, he said that it was difficult for him to get (sic)\n\n  at job in Australia ….41 I found that many items of expenses given by both parties were\n\n  excessive. They were certainly beyond the parties’ financial abilities. As stated\n\n  earlier, the circumstances surrounding the employment status of the husband were\n\n  suspicious. The husband had not shown that the reduction in his salary and the loss of his\n\n  job were due to circumstances beyond his control. In any event, the husband’s earning\n\n  capacity would be relevant even if he was unemployed. In my view, it was totally\n\n  irresponsible for the husband to suggest in his affidavit that he should not pay any\n\n  maintenance, even for the children, for 12 months since he was unemployed. The children\n\n  would still need to go to school, be fed and clothed even if their father was without a\n\n  job and he could not just leave it to the wife, who had not been working for the last 8\n\n  years, to bear all the expenses of the children. His counsel changed the position during\n\n  hearing and offered A$500 a month until October 2001 and thereafter at A$1,000 a month.42 However, even the A$1,000 a month offered by the husband was\n\n  obviously insufficient. ….’29.    Mr Rai submitted that the District Court\n\nhad erred in concluding that the circumstances of the termination of the Husband’s\n\nemployment were suspicious. He submitted that the Wife could have checked on the\n\ncircumstances but did not do so even though the termination letter mentioned a contact\n\ntelephone number and an e-mail address for inquiries. He submitted the burden was on the\n\nWife to prove her suspicions. He relied on another unreported decision of Prakash J in\n\nDivorce Petition No 202 of 1999,Wong Wai Leng Laura v Yap Thiam Nguan.30.    Accordingly, he submitted that the maintenance was\n\nexorbitant. He also submitted that even if I was not prepared to accept that the\n\nHusband’s employment had been terminated, the Husband was earning a smaller sum in\n\nAustralia than in Singapore.31.    Secondly, he submitted that the District Court\n\nshould have taken into account the Husband’s debts like his debts to the Singapore\n\nInland Revenue and his debts to credit card companies.32.    Thirdly, he submitted that the District Court\n\nerred in granting a lump sum maintenance of S$240,000 to the Wife based on S$2,000 per\n\nmonth x 10 years (i.e 120 months).33.    The District Court’s reason for the lump sum\n\nmaintenance is stated in para 43 of the GD and elaborated in para 44:‘43 As to the maintenance of the wife, I agreed\n\n  with her that she should be given a lump sum maintenance in so far as the husband had the\n\n  resources to pay. The husband had blatantly defaulted in the payment of the interim\n\n  maintenance. It was probable that he would default in future maintenance, especially that\n\n  of the wife.44 I calculated the amount of lump sum maintenance to be\n\n  S$240,000, based on the monthly sum of S$2,000 a month for the period of 10 years. The\n\n  husband would receive a certain amount from the share of the three properties in\n\n  Australia. This should be paid over to the wife to satisfy the lump sum maintenance. If he\n\n  did not want to retain the Hensman property, he would have about $190,000 being 40% of the\n\n  value of the three properties at $477,000. If he decided to keep the Hensman property, he\n\n  would have about $123,000, being $190,000 less $67,000, the value net of loan of the\n\n  Hensman property. The balance should then be paid in monthly instalments of S$1,000. He\n\n  had the option of withdrawing his CPF monies when he decided not to return to Singapore\n\n  permanently. When he so withdrew the CPF monies, he should use them to pay the rest of the\n\n  lump sum maintenance. I agreed that other than these sums of monies, he had no other\n\n  substantial assets.’34.    Mr Rai did not dispute the multiplier of\n\nten years. His submission was that the fear of the Husband failing to pay the monthly\n\nmaintenance was not a sufficient reason to warrant an order for the lump sum maintenance.\n\nHe relied on an unreported decision of Michael Hwang JC in Divorce Petition No 838 of\n\n1991,Seow Soo Huan v Lauw Boon Pek. There the court declined to order a lump sum\n\nmaintenance after citing various factors.35.    Mr Rai further submitted that the Husband was\n\nexpecting to get something from the three properties which he could use so as to move on\n\nwith his life. With the District Court’s order, he would be crippled. Mr Rai stressed\n\nthat although the Husband had monies in his CPF account, he could withdraw the monies only\n\nif he was prepared to undertake that he would not work in Singapore again. I would add\n\nthat the undertaking is a requirement of the relevant authority before allowing a foreign\n\nworker to withdraw his CPF monies before a specified retirement age. Mr Rai said that the\n\nHusband could not give the undertaking and withdraw his CPF monies as he was still\n\nconsidering working in Singapore because that was where he had got his highest income of\n\nS$170,000 per annum.36.    Mr Palakrishnan urged me to conclude that the\n\nHusband’s relocation to Australia was to thwart the Wife’s efforts to get\n\nmaintenance.37.    Furthermore, the purported termination should not\n\nbe accepted at face value. He stressed the following:(a) The reasons given by the District Court.(b) After the Husband was ordered to produce letters\n\n  from Cisco USA and Cisco Australia on his entire remuneration package, the Husband\n\n  belatedly produced the alleged letter of termination. In addition, notwithstanding the\n\n  alleged letter of termination, he was still obliged to but failed to produce the letters\n\n  on his entire remuneration packages prior to the alleged termination. On this point, Mr\n\n  Rai countered with the Husband’s explanation that as his services had been\n\n  terminated, Cisco Australia had refused to entertain ‘any request for information or\n\n  documents’ (see para 5 of the Husband’s affidavit filed on 11 June 2001). I\n\n  should point out that had the entire remuneration package been disclosed, it would have\n\n  also disclosed the bonuses and stock options, if any, that the Husband had received. The\n\n  quantum of the bonuses and stock options could not be obtained from the terms of\n\n  employment. Moreover, as regards the terms of employment, Cisco USA’s terms were\n\n  disclosed but not Cisco Australia’s. The Husband had alleged that, as far as he knew,\n\n  there was no formal contract with Cisco Australia but Mr Palakrishnan did not accept this\n\n  given the existence of comprehensive terms with Cisco USA.(c) The letter of termination was dated 22 May 2001\n\n  although the Husband’s termination was effective 16 March 2001. It was not even a\n\n  termination letter as such, as noted by the District Court. If the termination was\n\n  genuine, the Husband could not be unaware of the termination until May 2001 when he\n\n  disclosed the letter.(d) It was not known who purportedly signed the alleged\n\n  letter of termination on behalf of the Group Manager, Human Resources.38.    Mr Palakrishnan did not accept that the\n\nburden of proof was on the Wife to prove her suspicions. Rather, it was for the Husband to\n\nestablish his allegations. The decision inWong Wai Leng Laurawas because of the\n\npeculiar facts there.39.    As for the Husband’s debts, Mr\n\nPalakrishnan submitted that this point had already been raised during arguments for\n\ninterim maintenance. Also, the Husband had deliberately failed to pay his Singapore income\n\ntax so as to use it to counter the Wife’s application for maintenance.40.    As for the credit card debts, Mr\n\nPalakrishnan pointed out, as an illustration, that one of the statements of account was in\n\nrelation to a corporate credit card and not the Husband’s own credit card.\n\nFurthermore, that illustration referred to a statement of account dated 13 February 2001.\n\nIt was addressed to the Husband and below his name was the name of the company ‘CISCO\n\nSYSTEMS USA P L’. It was also addressed to Cisco USA’s address. Yet the Husband\n\nwas supposed to have ceased being employed by Cisco USA with effect from 1 January 2001.\n\nIn addition, Mr Palakrishnan submitted that there was no documentary evidence for some of\n\nthe alleged credit card expenses.41.    As regards the lump sum maintenance, Mr\n\nPalakrishnan stressed the Husband’s default in paying maintenance even when he was\n\nworking for Cisco USA and Cisco Australia. He also submitted that the Husband could give\n\nthe undertaking to withdraw the monies in his CPF account as he was not interested in\n\ncoming back to work in Singapore. He had not exhibited any letters from potential\n\nemployers in Singapore to demonstrate his attempts to find a job here, even though his\n\nhighest salary was derived from Singapore.CURRENCY OF MAINTENANCE42.    Mr Rai submitted that as the expenses of the Wife\n\nand the children were incurred in Australia, the maintenance should have been granted in\n\nthe currency of Australia.43.    Mr Palakrishnan submitted that the currency of\n\nmaintenance had not been raised before the District Court.44.    Furthermore, while he could not dispute that the\n\nexpenses were incurred in Australia, he pointed out that the Wife had submitted the\n\nexpenses in Singapore currency and she did distinguish between the two currencies in her\n\naffidavits.MY DECISIONThe three properties45.    Section 112(1) Women’s Charter gives the\n\ncourt power to order a division of matrimonial assets, when granting or subsequent to the\n\ngrant of a decree of divorce, in such proportions as the court thinks just and equitable.46.    Section 112(2) provides that:‘(2) It shall be the duty of the court in deciding\n\n  whether to exercise its power under subsection (1) and, if so, in what manner, to have\n\n  regard to all the circumstances of the case, including …. ’Various factors are set out, one of which is the needs\n\nof the children of the marriage.47.    However, it is my view that the needs of\n\nthe children are taken into account in order to determine the division. It is not correct\n\nto determine the division and then add a premium to take into account the needs of the\n\nchildren. There was nothing in the lecture given by Justice Prakash which would lead to\n\nsuch a conclusion. In addition, I do not see why the 10% should apply to all the three\n\nproperties.48.    In my view, the needs of the children have already\n\nbeen taken into account when the District Court ordered that the Chesters property be\n\ntransferred to the Wife upon her paying the Husband his share. It is not as though the\n\nWife is unable to pay the Husband’s share unless that share is reduced from 50% to\n\n40%.49.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order in\n\nrespect of the division of the three properties is varied in that the Wife’s\n\nproportion is 50% and the Husband’s proportion is 50% also. The consequential orders\n\nof the District Court in respect of the three properties remain, subject to the variation\n\nas mentioned.",
        "The Wife’s entitlement to S$187,000 in the\n\nHusband’s CPF account": "50.    As I have said, the Wife’s entitlement to the\n\nmonies in the Husband’s CPF account should be reduced, in the first instance, to\n\nS$182,000.51.    As for the question whether the Husband’s\n\npre-marital CPF balance should be excluded from the pool of matrimonial assets, it is true\n\nthat in theLam Chih Kiancase, the Court of Appeal considered the post-marital CPF\n\nmonies only as matrimonial assets. However, I agree with Mr Palakrishnan that that\n\ndecision was under the old s 106 Women’s Charter and that the current s 112(10)(a)(i)\n\nis new.52.    In my view, s 112(10)(a)(i) applies to the\n\nsituation where the parties’ CPF monies have been used to purchase the apartment in\n\nDairy Farm estate because the parties were residing there (see para 29 of the Wife’s\n\nAffidavit of Means). Even though this matrimonial home was subsequently sold and the sale\n\nproceeds were used to reimburse the CPF accounts from which the monies had been drawn, the\n\nmonies which were returned to the CPF accounts remained matrimonial assets. According to\n\nthe Wife, the surplus arising from the profit was used to acquire other matrimonial assets\n\nlike:(a) a 1991 Ford Falcon(b) a 1974 Mercedes(c) the Chesters Way property (see GD para 13)53.    Although Mr Rai had sought to argue that\n\nnot all the monies in the Husband’s CPF account had been used to buy the Dairy Farm\n\napartment, he was not able to establish this, even if the fresh evidence which he had\n\nsought to adduce had been allowed. That fresh evidence was simply a statement of his CPF\n\naccount as at 13 July 1984, one day before the marriage. Besides, his argument might have\n\nbeen effectively countered by the ‘first in, first out’ principle, but I need\n\nsay no more thereon.54.    At this stage, I would mention that I\n\ndisallowed Mr Rai’s application to adduce the fresh evidence in respect of the\n\nHusband’s pre-marital CPF balance even if I had an unfettered discretion to do so\n\nbecause:(a) The Husband had had more than ample time to obtain\n\n  such evidence but did not think of doing so until the eleventh hour when the District\n\n  Court was about to deliver its decision. Even then, he did not have the evidence and was\n\n  seeking an adjournment.(b) If I were to admit such evidence, I would\n\n  have to give the Wife an opportunity to obtain and produce evidence of her pre-marital CPF\n\n  balance.(c) In any event, the fresh evidence was unlikely to\n\n  make a material difference to the substantive dispute.55.    I would also mention that I also disallowed Mr\n\nRai’s application to adduce fresh evidence as to which party was earning dividends\n\nfrom shares because that evidence was not material. Indeed, Mr Rai did not attempt to\n\nillustrate its materiality in the course of the substantive arguments.56.    As regards the question whether CPF accounts\n\nshould be treated differently from other matrimonial assets, I accept Mr\n\nPalakrishnan’s argument that the decision of Prakash J in the case ofYah Cheng\n\nHuatwas based on the old s 106 Women’s Charter.57.    I am of the view that there is nothing in the\n\ncurrent s 112 Women’s Charter and nothing in the facts before me which would require\n\nme to treat monies in CPF accounts differently from other matrimonial assets which have\n\nbeen acquired by the sole effort of one of the parties.58.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order as\n\nregards the Wife’s entitlement to monies in the Husband’s CPF account is varied\n\nonly by reducing the sum from $187,000 to $182,000. The usual consequential orders\n\nregarding a charge thereon remain.",
        "Wife’s assets which were not taken into account by\n\nthe District Court": "59.    As regards the Wife’s insurance policy, she\n\nhas to continue paying the insurance premiums on it and she had said it was taken out for\n\nthe security of the children in case something happens to her. I am of the view that the\n\npolicy need not be taken into account in the division of matrimonial assets.60.    The Wife’s Australian shares should be taken\n\ninto account. There is a limit as to how far the argument about the children’s\n\nsecurity or welfare should go and it is not as though the Wife is penniless. I round up\n\nthe value of the Australian shares to A$20,000 and grant the Husband half the value\n\nthereof i.e A$10,000. The Wife may se-off the A$10,000 against any arrears of or future\n\nmaintenance payable for herself. This set-off does not apply to maintenance payable for\n\nthe children.61.    The Wife’s jewellery is mentioned in para 20\n\nof the GD and was probably taken into account by the District Court before giving the Wife\n\nan equal proportion in the matrimonial assets. In any event, the jewellery is personal to\n\nher and the value is only A$4,000. Furthermore, the Husband’s excess in the bank\n\naccounts comprising S$2,000 to S$2,500 has not been divided into two. I am of the view\n\nthat the value of the jewellery need not be divided into two to give the Husband cash in\n\nlieu of jewellery.",
        "Furniture": "62.    I have already said above that the Husband’s\n\nclaim for half of the value of the furniture is a non-starter.",
        "Maintenance: (a) for the children and (b) the lump sum\n\nfor the Wife": "63.    For the reasons given by the District Court and as\n\nelaborated by Mr Palakrishnan, I am of the view that the circumstances relating to the\n\nposting of the Husband to Sydney and the termination of his employment thereafter were\n\nmore than suspicious. The posting was engineered by the Husband. Also, if his services\n\nwere indeed terminated on 16 March 2001, the termination was also engineered by him. He\n\ndid all these things to avoid paying maintenance to the Wife and the children. On this\n\npoint, Ireiterate what the District Court\n\nsaid in para 7 of the GD i.e that the Husband had said he did see the children regularly\n\nas he did not want to be served with a summons for maintenance enforcement.64.    I do not agree that, prima facie, it is for the\n\nWife to prove her suspicions. The decision of Prakash J in the case ofWong Wai Leng\n\nLauradid not go as far as that. In that case, the judge was satisfied with the\n\nhusband’s explanations and accordingly it was then the wife who had to establish her\n\nsuspicions. It is first for a husband to provide satisfactory evidence to establish that\n\nhis posting or termination is bona fide. Likewise as regards his attempts to secure\n\nanother job.65.    In the case before me, the Husband’s evidence\n\nwas far from satisfactory. I do not accept his explanation that it was not possible for\n\nhim to get information from Cisco Australia after his services were terminated by them. He\n\napparently had no difficulty in getting the alleged termination letter from them two\n\nmonths after the alleged termination. Furthermore, he did not say that he faced a similar\n\ndifficulty with Cisco USA. In my view, the Husband did not make any genuine attempt to\n\nobtain letters from either employer on his entire remuneration package.66.    As for the debts of the Husband, his liability to\n\nthe Singapore Inland Revenue arises from his highest income from Singapore. There was no\n\nsuggestion that at that time, he was unable to pay the maintenance and his income tax\n\nwhich was payable in instalments. There is no valid reason why he cannot pay the tax in\n\ninstalments. I am of the view that he did not do so so that he could use this outstanding\n\ndebt as an excuse to reduce the maintenance to be paid by him.67.    As for the credit card debts, he has no business\n\nincurring them if he cannot afford to do so. I also note that some of the debts were\n\nincurred on a corporate credit card.68.    As regards the question whether a lump sum\n\nmaintenance should have been ordered, the decision of Hwang JC in the case ofSeow Soo\n\nHuanwas on different facts. There, it was not alleged that the husband was a\n\npersistent defaulter.69.    Indeed inChoo Guay Tin v Lee Mong Seng[2001] 3 SLR 116, Justice G P Selvam was of the view that a lump sum maintenance was appropriate\n\nwhere the husband would not make regular payments, provided the husband was able to pay a\n\nlump sum. That was my view too in Divorce Petition No 983 of 1992,Soh Seng Hwee v Paw\n\nLing Chiang Lina. The only reason whyI\n\nnevertheless declined to make a lump sum maintenance order in that case was because there\n\nwas insufficient evidence before me about the husband’s assets and income and I was\n\nconcerned that a lump sum maintenance order might cripple him.70.    In the present case, I do not have such a fear\n\nbecause the District Court has directed how the lump sum may be paid i.e with most of it\n\nbeing paid with the aid of various set-offs and the balance in instalments. I do not agree\n\nwith Mr Rai’s submission that the Husband will be crippled because he will not\n\nreceive any monies, after the set-offs, from the three properties. As I have said, he has\n\ndeliberately failed to obtain letters on his entire remuneration package and he has his\n\nearning capacity. If he is truly jobless, that is by his design.71.    The Husband has only himself to blame for the lump\n\nsum maintenance. Even when he was earning his highest income from Singapore, he was in\n\ndefault of his maintenance obligations.72.    On the other hand, I accept that the Husband may\n\nwant to work in Singapore in future and hence he is not able to give the requisite\n\nundertaking to withdraw all the monies in his CPF account. The real reason why he has not\n\nsought alternative employment here after May 2001 is, as I have said, because of the\n\nWife’s legal proceedings. However, again, it is up to him to decide whether to seek\n\nemployment in Singapore.",
        "Currency of maintenance": "73.    I accept that, as a general rule, the currency of\n\nmaintenance should be that of the currency of the country where the expenses, for which\n\nmaintenance was ordered, were incurred. That country is Australia. No reason was given by\n\nMr Palakrishnan as to why the Wife should be entitled to list the expenses in Singapore\n\ncurrency.74.    Accordingly, I vary the District Court’s\n\norders on the currency of maintenance, including the lump sum maintenance, to the currency\n\nof Australia. For the avoidance of doubt, the currency of interim maintenance is not\n\naffected by my order. If any monies has already been received by the Wife in Singapore\n\ncurrency towards account of maintenance for the children and/or for herself, there is no\n\nneed to convert such monies to the Australia equivalent. For this limited purpose, the\n\nWife will be deemed to have received the monies in Australian currency.",
        "SUMMARY": "75.    Accordingly, the District Court’s order is\n\nvaried to the extent I have stated. I will hear the parties on costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
