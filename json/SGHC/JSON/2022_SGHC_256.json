        "Introduction": "1 The plaintiff, Vibrant Group Limited, commenced Suit 1046 of 2020 (“Suit 1046”) against the defendants in relation to its acquisition of a company incorporated in Australia, Blackgold International Holdings Pty Ltd (“Blackgold Australia”). The plaintiff alleges that the first and second defendants made fraudulent or, in the alternative, negligent misrepresentations that induced the plaintiff to acquire Blackgold Australia, causing the plaintiff to suffer loss and damage. The plaintiff alleges that the third defendant’s negligence in conducting the audit of Blackgold Australia and in preparing the audit report caused the plaintiff to suffer loss and damage. 2 The second defendant applied by HC/SUM 423/2022 (“SUM 423/2022”) to set aside two orders of court1Foot Note 1×HC/ORC 6732/2020 and HC/ORC 7109/2021 of HC/S 1046/2020.granting the plaintiff leave to serve its writ of summons and statement of claim (and amended versions thereof) out of jurisdiction on the second defendant in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”) or, in the alternative, for Suit 1046 to be stayed on the ground offorum nonconveniens. The third defendant made a similar application by HC/SUM 1361/2022 (“SUM 1361/2022”) to set aside an order2Foot Note 2×HC/ORC 7110/2021 of HC/S 1046/2020.granting the plaintiff leave to serve its amended writ of summons and statement of claim out of jurisdiction on the third defendant in Australia. 3 SUM 423/2022 and SUM 1361/2022 were heard by the learned Assistant Registrar Justin Yeo (the “learned AR”). The learned AR declined to set aside the service out of jurisdiction orders or to stay the proceedings in respect of the second defendant and dismissed SUM 423/2022 on 1 April 2022,3Foot Note 3×[2022] SGHCR 4 at [42] and [49].but granted the application in SUM 1361/2022 to set aside the service out of jurisdiction order in respect of the third defendant on 4 July 2022.4Foot Note 4×[2022] SGHCR 8 at [48].HC/RA 92/2022 (“RA 92/2022”) and HC/RA 234/2022 (“RA 234/2022”) are appeals against the decisions of the learned AR in SUM 423/2022 (by the second defendant) and SUM 1361/2022 (by the plaintiff) respectively. I heard both appeals together on 1 September 2022. For the reasons set out in this judgment, I dismiss both appeals in their entirety.",

        "The parties": "4 The plaintiff is a company incorporated in Singapore and listed on the Singapore Exchange (the “SGX”).5Foot Note 5×Khua Kian Keong’s 1st Affidavit of 9 December 2020 (“Khua’s 1st Affidavit”) at para 7.The first defendant is a Singapore citizen and was, at the material time, the Chairman of Blackgold Australia.6Foot Note 6×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 8.The second defendant is a citizen of the PRC and was, at the material time, the Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of Blackgold Australia.7Foot Note 7×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 9.Prior to the plaintiff’s acquisition of Blackgold Australia, the management of Blackgold Australia included, among others, the first and second defendants, and Blackgold Australia’s Chief Financial Officer at the material time, one Tin It Phong (“Tin”).8Foot Note 8×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 22. 5 Leave was granted to the plaintiff to add the third defendant as a party on 1 December 2021,9Foot Note 9×HC/ORC 6702/2021 of HC/S 1046/2020.slightly more than a year after Suit 1046 was commenced against the first and second defendants on 30 October 2020.10Foot Note 10×Writ of Summons.The third defendant is a company incorporated in Australia that provides financial advisory and accounting services. In or around 2013, the third defendant changed its name from “WHK Pty Ltd” to “Crowe Horwath (Aust) Pty Ltd”. Subsequently, in or around 2019, the third defendant changed its name from “Crowe Horwath (Aust) Pty Ltd” to “Findex (Aust) Pty Ltd”.11Foot Note 11×Khua Kian Keong’s 3rd Affidavit of 23 December 2021 (“Khua’s 3rd Affidavit”) at para 10.At the material time, the third defendant and seven individuals were trading as a partnership under the name “Crowe Horwath Perth” (the “Partnership”).12Foot Note 12×Khua’s 3rd Affidavit at para 11.The Partnership was engaged by Blackgold Australia, by way of an engagement letter dated 24 October 2016 (the “Engagement Letter”) to audit the annual financial report for the year ending on 31 October 2016 (the “FY 2016 financial report”) of a group of companies for which Blackgold Australia was the ultimate holding company (the “Blackgold Group”). The Partnership was also engaged to prepare an auditor’s report in respect of the said annual financial report (the “audit report”) (collectively, the “Financial Reports”),13Foot Note 13×Khua’s 3rd Affidavit at paras 19–20.in accordance with Part 2M.3 of the Australia Corporations Act 2001 (Cth).14Foot Note 14×Khua’s 3rd Affidavit at para 11.The plaintiff’s claim against the third defendant is for the Partnership’s alleged negligence in doing this work.15Foot Note 15×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) at paras 53A–53D.",
        "The plaintiff’s acquisition of Blackgold Australia": "6 Blackgold Australia was listed on the Australia Securities Exchange (the “ASX”) on 22 February 2011 through an initial public offering.16Foot Note 16×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 11.As the ultimate holding company of the Blackgold Group, Blackgold Australia controlled, via a corporate structure involving various subsidiaries, companies incorporated in the PRC (the “PRC subsidiaries”) which were purportedly in the business of coal mining, coal trading and/or commodity logistics.17Foot Note 17×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 12. 7 In or around 2014, the first defendant approached the plaintiff’s CEO, Khua Kian Keong (“Khua”), to discuss the prospect of acquiring the Blackgold Group’s business as a whole, by acquiring Blackgold Australia.18Foot Note 18×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 15.However, the plaintiff was not interested in acquiring Blackgold Australia at that time. In or around 2016, the first defendant approached Khua again, in Singapore, to discuss the possibility of the plaintiff fully acquiring Blackgold Australia.19Foot Note 19×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at paras 15–16.Flowing from those discussions, the plaintiff conducted a review that included an evaluation of the Blackgold Group’s financial position from August to October 2016 (the “Review Process”).20Foot Note 20×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 17. 8 The Review Process was led by the plaintiff’s finance team, which met the first defendant and Tin at the plaintiff’s offices in Singapore in September 2016 for an introduction to the Blackgold Group.21Foot Note 21×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at paras 21–22; Yong Kar Ming’s Affidavit dated 18 February 2022 (“Yong Kar Ming’s Affidavit”) at para 13.The finance team raised queries and requested documents relating to the Blackgold Group’s financial records, accounts and business operations, including the internal unaudited financial and accounting records of the Blackgold Group entities, as well as the audited financial reports of Blackgold Australia. The finance team also collected information relating to the Blackgold Group’s financial status and business operations. During this period, the first and second defendants allegedly procured and/or provided responses to the finance team’s queries by making available, among other things, information and documents that had been prepared, presented, reported, endorsed or provided by them.22Foot Note 22×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at paras 22–23. 9 The plaintiff claims that the first and second defendants made various representations (the “Alleged Misrepresentations”) between early-2016 and July 2017 about the value and business of Blackgold Australia, orally and by the provision of information and documents, to induce the plaintiff to acquire Blackgold Australia.23Foot Note 23×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at paras 24–25. 10 In addition, the plaintiff alleges that it relied on the Financial Reports, in deciding to proceed with the acquisition of Blackgold Australia (the “Acquisition”).24Foot Note 24×Khua’s 3rd Affidavit at para 21.The plaintiff asserts that the Partnership was engaged in connection with the proposed Acquisition, and the Partnership was aware that the shareholders of Blackgold Australia intended to dispose of their interest in Blackgold Australia to potential acquirers, including the plaintiff. In particular, the Partnership was aware that the plaintiff was in discussions with Blackgold Australia in relation to the Acquisition.25Foot Note 25×Khua’s 3rd Affidavit at para 18–19. 11 On 28 October 2016, the plaintiff and Blackgold Australia entered into a scheme implementation deed (the “Scheme Implementation Deed”), which provided that the Acquisition was to take place through a scheme of arrangement (the “scheme”), in accordance with the Australia Corporations Act 2001(Cth).26Foot Note 26×Peng Yuguo’s 1st Affidavit dated 24 February 2022 at para 30 (“Peng’s 1st Affidavit”).The Federal Court of Australia granted leave on 24 May 2017 for Blackgold Australia to convene a scheme meeting, for the shareholders of Blackgold Australia to consider approving the scheme.27Foot Note 27×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at paras 32–33. 12 According to the second defendant, in the course of negotiations leading up to the scheme meeting, he, as a majority shareholder in Blackgold Australia,28Foot Note 28×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at para 9.requested an increase in the cash consideration for the scheme.29Foot Note 29×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at paras 41 and 45.The second defendant claims that as a result, Khua proposed that the parties enter into an agreement whereby, in exchange for the second defendant supporting the scheme and not seeking an increase in cash consideration for the scheme, Khua would warrant on the plaintiff’s behalf that Khua had conducted his own due diligence and that he had fully understood the underlying operations and financial and legal positions of the Blackgold Group, including any unfavourable information, and had nonetheless decided to proceed with the Acquisition.30Foot Note 30×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at paras 47–48.Shortly before the scheme meeting, the parties signed a letter of undertaking (the “LOU”) drafted in Chinese dated 25 June 2017, setting out those terms.31Foot Note 31×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at para 50 and p 466.There was an undertaking in the LOU not to hold the second defendant liable:32Foot Note 32×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at p 466. … [Khua and the first defendant] will not hold [the second defendant] accountable or make any claim against him, or ask to reduce the acquisition price or require [the second defendant] to make an economic compensation or bear any liabilities of the management and operation of [Blackgold Australia], neither will [the plaintiff] make such claims. 13  Khua, however, disputes the second defendant’s version of the event. His evidence is that the second defendant presented the LOU to him to sign shortly before the scheme meeting because the second defendant wanted assurance that the plaintiff would not look to him for compensation or hold him accountable for the management and operation of Blackgold Australia after the Acquisition.33Foot Note 33×Khua Kian Keong’s Affidavit dated 18 February 2022 (“Khua’s 4th Affidavit”) at paras 42–45. 14 The scheme meeting took place in Perth, Western Australia, on 26 June 2017,34Foot Note 34×Peng’s 1st Affidavit at para 73(b).and the Acquisition was eventually completed for a price of AUD37,635,863 on 13 July 2017.35Foot Note 35×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at para 18. 15 The plaintiff claims that subsequent to the Acquisition, it discovered that the first and second defendants had made false representations to it. The Alleged Misrepresentations came to light following a special investigation (the “special audit”) into certain irregularities and discrepancies in the trading receipts and sale invoices of some of the PRC subsidiaries (the “Irregularities”). The special audit was carried out by a special auditor, Ernst & Young Advisory Pte Ltd (“EY”), appointed by the plaintiff’s audit committee. The special audit by EY allegedly revealed, among other things, widespread falsification of financial and accounting information, records and other documents, and questionable transactions by and/or involving the management of the Blackgold Group, which included the first and second defendants.36Foot Note 36×Khua’s 1st Affidavit at paras 41–42.",
        "The law": "",
        "The requirements for service out of jurisdiction": "16 The Singapore courts’inpersonamjurisdiction is properly founded over a defendant when the defendant has been duly served with an originating process, either inside or outside of Singapore, in a manner authorised by the law (in respect of service outside of Singapore, see,eg,PT Gunung Madu Plantations v Muhammad Jimmy Goh Mashun[2018] 4 SLR 1420 at [16]). The statutory basis for theinpersonamjurisdiction of the Singapore courts over a defendant who is outside Singapore is found in s 16(1)(a)(ii) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 2007 Rev Ed), which provides as follows: Civil jurisdiction — general 16.—(1) The General Division shall have jurisdiction to hear and try any action in personam where — (a) the defendant is served with a writ of summons or any other originating process — … (ii) outside Singapore in the circumstances authorised by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court or Family Justice Rules ... 17 Order 11 r 1 of the presently revoked Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) as in force immediately before 1 April 2022 (the “ROC”) sets out the grounds and conditions for the court to grant leave for service out of jurisdiction. 18 It is trite that the following three requirements must be met for the plaintiff to obtain leave to serve originating processes out of jurisdiction (see,eg,Oro Negro Drilling Pte Ltd and others vIntegradora de Servicios Petroleros Oro Negro SAPI de CV and others and another appeal (Jesus Angel Guerra Mendez, non-party)[2020] 1 SLR 226(“Oro”) at [54], referring toZoom Communications Ltd v Broadcast Solutions Pte Ltd[2014] 4 SLR 500 (“Zoom Communications”) at [26]): (a) First, the plaintiff must have a good arguable case that its claim falls within one of the “jurisdictional gateways” under O 11 r 1 of the ROC.(b) Second, there must be a sufficient degree of merit to the plaintiff’s claim.(c) Third, Singapore must be the more appropriate forum for the trial or determination of the action. 19 The plaintiff bears the burden of showing that all three requirements are met (MAN Diesel & Turbo SE and another v IMSkaugen SE and another[2020] 1 SLR 327 (“MAN Diesel (CA)”) at [29]). This applies both at the stage of theexparteapplication by the plaintiff seeking leave to serve out of jurisdiction, and at theinterpartesstage after the defendant has entered an appearance and seeks to set aside the order. 20 Furthermore, at the stage of theexparteapplication, the plaintiff is required to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts within the plaintiff’s knowledge (seeThe“Vasiliy Golovnin”[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 at [83]). A failure to do so may be a ground to set aside an order granting leave for service out of jurisdiction (Oroat [54], referring toZoom Communicationsat [68]–[69]). 21 In both the appeals before me, there is no dispute that the first two requirements are met. Only the third requirement,ie, that Singapore must be the proper forum for the trial of the action, is in dispute. 22 The applicable legal principles for determining whether Singapore is the more appropriate forum for the purpose of service of process out of jurisdiction are well established (seeOroat [80]): (a) The question of whether Singapore is the more appropriate forum for the action only arises for determination if the court is first satisfied that there is at least another available forum. Singapore can only beforum nonconveniensif there is a more appropriate forum other than Singapore.(b) The plaintiff bears the burden of demonstrating that Singapore is, on balance, the more appropriate forum. It is strictly irrelevant whether Singapore is the more appropriate forum “by a hair or by a mile”.(c) The inquiry for determining whether Singapore is the more appropriate forum is the same as that undertaken at the first stage of theSpiliadatest. This means that Singapore will be the more appropriate forum if it has the most real and substantial connection with the disputes raised. The court should weigh the connecting factors that have the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute rather than undertake a mechanical application of established connecting factors. The court should also be primarily concerned with the quality of the connecting factors rather than the quantity of factors on each side of the scale. 23 As explained inHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporevol 6(2) (LexisNexis, 2020 Reissue) (“Halsbury’s Laws of Singapore”)at para 75.090, at the first stage of theSpiliadatest, general connecting factors are considered. In examining these factors, it is important to have regard to what the case is about. Connections that have little or no bearing on the adjudication of the issues in dispute between the parties will carry little weight. The search is for connecting factors that have the most relevant and substantial associations with the dispute (seeRappo, Tania v Accent Delight International Ltd and another and another appeal[2017] 2 SLR 265(“TaniaRappo”) at [70]). 24 The Court of Appeal set out inJIO Minerals FZC and others v Mineral Enterprises Ltd[2011] 1 SLR 391 (“JIO Minerals”) five indicators for consideration at the first stage of theSpiliadatest at [42] (see alsoHalsbury’s Laws of Singaporeat paras 75.091–75.095): (a) the personal connections of the parties and the witnesses to the competing fora;(b) the connections between relevant events and transactions to the competing fora;(c) the law applicable to the dispute;(d) the existence of parallel proceedings elsewhere (ie,lisalibi pendens); and(e) the “shape of the litigation”, which includes the manner in which the claim and the defence have been pleaded. 25 Ultimately, in this exercise of determining the proper forum for the trial of the action, the court seeks to identify the jurisdiction in which the case may be “tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice” (seeTaniaRappoat [72]).",
        "RA 92/2022": "26 As mentioned (at [1] and [3] above), the plaintiff claims against the second defendant for fraudulent, or in the alternative, negligent misrepresentations, and RA 92/2022 is the second defendant’s appeal against the learned AR’s decision declining to set aside the service out of jurisdiction orders or to stay the proceedings in respect of the second defendant. I shall refer to the alleged wrongful actions of the first and second defendants in the misrepresentation claims collectively as the “torts”. 27 The issues raised in RA 92/2022 are as follows. First, whether the learned AR erred in finding that Singapore is the proper forum for the trial of the action against the second defendant. In connection with this point, the following sub-issues are raised: (a) whether the place of the torts is Australia (or Singapore);(b) whether the connecting factors point towards Australia as the more appropriate forum; and(c) whether there is a risk of conflicting decisions if the plaintiff’s claim against the second defendant continues in Singapore while its claim against the third defendant is pursued in Australia. 28 Further, there is an issue of whether the learned AR erred in declining to set aside the orders for service out of jurisdiction in respect of the second defendant on the basis of the plaintiff’s failure to disclose all material facts when obtaining the orders for service out of jurisdiction.",
        "Whether the service out of jurisdiction orders should be set aside because Singapore is not the proper forum": "The place of the tort 51 The plaintiff submitted that the key elements of the tort of negligence inform the place of the tort, and that the place of the tort is Singapore for the following reasons: (a) With regard to the duty of care allegedly owed by the third defendant to the plaintiff, the plaintiff emphasised that the Partnership had voluntarily assumed responsibility towards a Singapore-incorporated company and that the plaintiff had relied on the Financial Reports, prepared by the Partnership, in Singapore.59Foot Note 59×Plaintiff’s Written Submissions for RA 234/2022 dated 26 August 2022 (“PWS2”) at paras 42-45.(b) With regard to the standard of care, it was contended that even though the Australia accounting standards are applicable, this is a neutral factor as both the Singapore and Australia standards are largely similar.60Foot Note 60×Minute sheet in RA 92/2022 and RA 234/2022 dated 1 September 2022.The plaintiff also refers to the possibility of transferring this case to the Singapore International Commercial Court (“SICC”) and thus being able to adduce foreign law on the basis of submissions rather than proof.61Foot Note 61×PWS2 at paras 54–56.(c) With regard to loss and damage, the plaintiff points out that it remitted funds from Singapore to acquire Blackgold Australia and incurred costs and expenses to investigate the Irregularities in Singapore.62Foot Note 62×PWS2 at paras 49–51. 52 The plaintiff contends that the learned AR had “under-emphasised the place of reliance” by the plaintiff.63Foot Note 63×PWS2 at para 41.I do not agree with the plaintiff. The learned AR had considered the fact of reliance by the plaintiff on the audit report to be relevant in the determination of the place of the tort and accorded due weight to it (seeVibrant Group Ltdv Tong Chi Ho and others[2022] SGHCR 8 (“Vibrant Group Ltd 2”) at [32(c)]). The authorities are clear that in cases of pure economic loss where the links between the parties are not “bounded by the physical laws of nature”, a duty of care would generally arise “where the defendant has voluntarily assumed responsibility to the plaintiff and/or the plaintiff has reasonably relied on the defendant to take care to avoid such loss” (NTUCFoodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another[2018] 4 SLR 762 at [21]). On appeal, the Court of Appeal inNTUCFoodfare Co-operative Ltd v SIA Engineering Co Ltd and another[2018] 2 SLR 588 further observed (at [41]) that: … in cases of pure economic loss, there may be sufficient legal proximity between the parties even if the defendant does not voluntarily assume responsibility to the plaintiff and the latter does not specifically rely on the former not to cause it loss … We agree with the Judge that there was no assumption of responsibility or specific reliance. However, in our judgment, these are neither essential nor inflexible conditions for the requirement of proximity to be fulfilled in cases of pure economic loss. Other aspects of the relationship between the parties may establish a sufficiently close relation between them for a duty of care to arise; it is thus necessary to consider physical, circumstantial and causal proximity and the proximity factors referred to … above. 53  Having regard to the reliance that the plaintiff placed on the Partnership, I agree with the conclusion of the learned AR and the third defendant’s submissions,64Foot Note 64×Third Defendant’s Written Submissions dated 26 August 2022 (“D3WS”) at para 103.that the duty of care, if any arises, emanates from the Partnership’s duty to take reasonable care in complying with Australia law and the applicable accounting or auditing principles, standards and practices in Australia. The plaintiff’s argument that is premised on the reliance of the plaintiff as one of the proximity factors does not shift the balance towards Singapore as the proper forum. The element of reliance, which must be established to succeed in a misrepresentation claim, is only one of the possible ways by which a duty of care could arise in a negligence claim. Any reliance by the plaintiff is therefore accorded greater significance in the misrepresentation action against the second defendant and less significance in the negligence action against the third defendant. Accordingly, I am of the view that the learned AR did not err in the amount of emphasis that he gave to the place of reliance. 54 The principles guiding the application of the “substance test” in respect of thetort of negligenceappears to be a relatively unexplored point of law in our local jurisprudence.65Foot Note 65×PWS2 at para 40; D3WS at para 108.I turn now to examine the English and Australian authorities cited by the third defendant on this point. 55 InBase Metal TradingLtd v Shamurin[2005] 1 WLR 1157 (“Base Metal Trading”),the defendant and two Russian nationals were in the business of investing and trading in metal. They had formed a number of Russian companies for this purpose but wanted to set up a foreign company that would attract customers who were reluctant to trade with the existing Russian companies in view of the prevailing banking, legal and regulatory situation in Russia at the time. The claimant company was thus set up and incorporated in Guernsey, and the defendant and one of the Russian nationals (“Yuri”) were made directors of the claimant company. The defendant was responsible for selling metal to foreign purchasers and was generally responsible for the claimant company’s activities outside of Russia. The defendant and Yuri had agreed that the claimant company would hedge the company’s exposure on resale price on physical trades by means of future trades made on the London Metal Exchange. Subsequently, the claimant company alleged that the defendant made a series of speculative trades in the name of the claimant company that resulted in losses of over £6m. The claimant company thus brought a claim for the damages and losses suffered as a result of the defendant’s alleged breach of duty of care. At first instance, the judge found, among other things, that the claim in tort was governed by Russian law, under which it was undisputed that the claims were not actionable. 56 The judge at first instance answered the question “where in substance was the tort committed?” by identifying “the gravamen of the case against [the defendant] as being [his] decision to speculate” (Base Metal Tradingat [16]). This was a decision made in Moscow, Russia, where all aspects of the claimant company’s business were conducted. The judge also found that although the trades were done in London where the claimant company had its bank account, the place where the loss was in fact felt by the claimant company was Russia, manifested by its lack of liquidity (Base Metal Tradingat [16]). The judge’s decision was affirmed in part on appeal to the English Court of Appeal. 57 Tuckey LJ (delivering the leading judgment of the English Court of Appeal) reasoned (at [46]): …the wrongful acts, being the decisions to speculate and give instructions accordingly,all took place in Russia.The place where the loss occurs is not determinative.When damage has occurred which makes the tort complete the right approach is to look back over the series of events constituting it and ask where in substance the cause of action arose: seeDistillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Thompson[1971] AC 458, 468. The judge after this long trial was entitled to conclude that [the claimant] really felt its loss in Russia. As part of its claim it had alleged that it had been unable to fulfil a contract in Russia because of the liquidity crisis caused by [the defendant’s] activities. The judge obviously did not ignore the fact that the trading losses occurred in London where [the claimant] had its bank account, but again it does not seem to me that these factors compelled the judge to conclude that all [the claimant company’s] loss had occurred here, still less that the substance of the tort was committed here [in the United Kingdom]. [emphasis added] 58Distillers Co (Biochemicals) Ltd v Laura Anne Thompson[1971] AC 458 (“Distillers Co”) is a case that was cited with approval by our Court of Appeal inJIO Minerals(at [90]) andMAN Diesel (CA)(at [101] and [103]) as authority for the “substance test”. InDistillers Co, the first defendant was an English company which manufactured a drug containing thalidomide. The drug was distributed to an Australian company which sold it in New South Wales. The claimant’s mother bought and ingested the drug while pregnant, which allegedly caused the claimant to be born without arms and with defective eyesight. The claimant commenced an action in the Supreme Court of New South Wales, alleging that the first defendant’s negligence as the manufacturer and supplier of the drug caused the claimant to be born with disabilities. 59 In upholding the decision of the Court of Appeal of the Supreme Court of New South Wales refusing the first defendant’s attempt at setting aside the writ, the Privy Council reasoned (at 469B–469E) that: So far as appears, the goods were not defective or incorrectly manufactured. The negligence was in failure to give a warning that the goods would be dangerous if taken by an expectant mother in the first three months of pregnancy … The plaintiff is entitled to complain of the lack of such communication in New South Wales [even though the warning could have been put in place when the drug was manufactured in England] as negligence by the defendant in New South Wales causing injury to the plaintiff there. That is the act (which must include omission) on the part of the English company which has given the plaintiff a cause of complaint in law. The cause of action arose within the jurisdiction. 60 Importantly, the Privy Council also cautioned that it would be inappropriate to determine the place of the tort based only on the place where damage happened (at 467H–468A): In a negligence case the happening of damage to the plaintiff is a necessary ingredient in the cause of action, and it is the last event completing the cause of action. But the place where it happens may be quite fortuitous and should not by itself be the sole determinant of jurisdiction. 61 InDow Jones & Company Inc vGutnick[2002] 194 ALR 433 (“Dow Jones”), a case involving the tort of defamation, the High Court of Australia made the following general observation(at [43]): Attempts to apply a single rule of location (such as a rule that intentional torts are committed where the tortfeasor acts, or that torts are committed in the place where the last event necessary to make the actor liable has taken place) have proved unsatisfactory if only because the rules pay insufficient regard to the different kinds of tortious claims that may be made … In the end the question is ‘where in substance did this cause of action arise’? In cases, like trespass ornegligence, wheresome quality of the defendant’s conduct is critical,it will usually be very important to look to where the defendant acted, not to where the consequences of the conduct were felt.[emphasis added] 62 In my view, the decisions inBase Metal Trading,Distillers CoandDow Jonesprovide instructive guidance, considering that the “substance test” was identified as the applicable test for determining the place of the tort in each of those cases.Distillers Cois also the very authority that our Court of Appeal inJIO MineralsandMAN Diesel (CA)relied upon for the “substance test” (see [58] above). Read together withDow Jones(see [61] above), the place where the alleged wrongful act was committed is to be given greater significance in a case involving the tort of negligence. On the other hand, the place where the loss was suffered is not, by itself, determinative. It is on this basis that inBase Metal Trading, the place of the tort was adjudged to be Russia, where the wrongful decisions to speculate were taken and instructions to trade were given accordingly (see [55]–[57] above). Similarly, inDistillers Co, the place of the tort was found to be Australia, where the defendant failed to provide any warning of possible side effects of the drug for pregnant women (see [58]–[59] above). 63 The crux of the plaintiff’s action against the third defendant is premised on the Partnership’s alleged negligence in conducting the audit and in rendering the audit report, and its alleged failure to uncover the Irregularities. Since the Partnership is alleged to have fallen short of an alleged duty of care owed to the plaintiff in relation to professional services provided by the Partnership in Australia, the place of the alleged wrongdoing is Australia. As such, even if the provision of the third defendant’s professional services in Australia involved an audit exercise that may have spanned across various jurisdictions, the conclusion remains unchanged. I therefore find that the learned AR did not err in concluding that “the fact that parts of the audit may possibly have been conducted in the PRC or Malaysia does not aid the plaintiff’s attempt to demonstrate that Singapore is the proper forum” (seeVibrant Group Ltd 2at [32(b)]). 64 I note additionally that beyond the cases cited by the third defendant, there appears to be further support for giving significant weight to the place where the negligent act occurred in determining the place of the tort. In Martin Davieset al,Nygh’s Conflict of Laws in Australia(LexisNexis Butterworths, 10th Ed, 2020) (“Nygh’sConflict of Laws”)at paras 20.9 and 20.12, the position in Australia is as follows: 20.9 If the tort alleged is based on a negligent act or omission of the defendant causing physical harm, the tort is committed in the place where that negligent act or omission occurred, even though consequential injury was suffered elsewhere …The same is true in cases of negligent acts causing purely economic loss; the tort is committed where the negligent act occurred, not where the loss was suffered. 20.12If the negligence consists of a failure to provide services or advice without proper care, the tort is committed in the place where those services were or ought to have been rendered… [emphasis added] 65 For the proposition at para 20.12,Nygh’sConflict of Lawsrefers to the case ofVothv Manildra Flour Mills Pty Ltd(1990) 97 ALR 124 (“Voth”). I am mindful thatVothconcerned a stay application, and that the test of whether the forum in which a stay was sought was a “clearly inappropriate forum” endorsed inVothhas been rejected by the Court of Appeal inJIO Mineralsat [45]. For avoidance of doubt, I referenceVothonlyin relation to the reasoning adopted in respect of identifying the place of the tort, given the similarities in the fact patterns inVothand the present case. 66 InVoth, the respondent companies were incorporated and resident in New South Wales and were members of a group of companies (the “Group”). The respondents obtained leave to serve their statement of claim outside New South Wales and in the State of Missouri, United States of America (the “US”), in order to commence professional negligence proceedings in the Supreme Court of New South Wales against the appellant, who was an accountant practising in the State of Missouri. The appellant had provided accounting, auditing and related services to the Group’s operating company in the US (“MMC”), which was a corporation established under the laws of the State of Kansas. The Internal Revenue Code of the US imposed upon the first respondent liability to income tax in respect of interest paid to it by MMC and also imposed an obligation upon MMC to deduct and withhold the tax. The required deductions and payments of withholding tax were not made, and the respondents alleged that the failure to do so was the result of negligent acts or omissions by the appellant. The damage to the respondents was largely suffered in New South Wales. The appellant submitted, among other things, that New South Wales was a clearly inappropriate forum (this being the test in Australian jurisprudence for cases concerning service out of jurisdiction) because the cause of action sued on by the respondents is a foreign tort, given that the acts or omissions complained of occurred outside New South Wales (Vothat 142). The High Court of Australia (per Mason CJ, Dean, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ, with Brennan J dissenting), held that the allegedly negligent act was initiated and completed in Missouri and thus the tort, if there was one, was committed in Missouri. In arriving at this conclusion, the majority reasoned as follows (Vothat 143–144): It was held inJackson vSpittall(1870) LR 5 CP 542 [(“Jackson vSpittall”)] at 552, that the question whether a cause of action is to be classified as local or foreign is to be answered by ascertaining the place of ‘the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint’ … The authority ofJackson vSpittallwas expressly affirmed in [Distillers Co], at 467 [in which the Privy Council adopted the “substance test”] … The approach formulated inDistillers[ie, the “substance test”] does no more than lay down an approach by which there is to be ascertained, in a common sense way, that which is required byJackson vSpittall, namely, the place of ‘the act on the part of the defendant which gives the plaintiff his cause of complaint’ … One thing that is clear fromJackson vSpittalland fromDistillersis thatit is some act of the defendant, and not its consequences, that must be the focus of attention.Thus, inDistillersthe act of ingestion of the drug Distaval by the plaintiff’s mother was ignored, the place of that act being treated like the place of the happening of damage, as one that might have been ‘quite fortuitous’. … The act of the appellant giving the respondents their cause of complaint was committed in Missouri and thus the tort, if there was one, was committed in Missouri. [emphasis added] 67 As can be gleaned from the above extract, the majority held that it was the location of the defendant’sactionsand not the location where theconsequencesof those actions were felt that must be the focus of attention. The place of the tort was found to be Missouri in the US, because the negligent audit was done there. This line of reasoning is consistent with the authorities ofBase Metal Trading,Distillers CoandDow Jones, which I relied on for my conclusion (at [62] above) as to the relevant principles for determining the place of the tort in the context of negligence. 68 The majority inVothultimately decided to allow the appeal and order that the action be stayed. In arriving at that decision, the majority considered, among other things, that: (a) the action had a substantial connection with the law of Missouri; (b) the appellant resided and worked in Missouri and the professional standards of accountants in Missouri would therefore be relevant to his liability; and (c) the greater part of the evidence in any trial of the action would be found in Missouri (Vothat 145). 69 Brennan J, the dissenting judge, proceeded on a different basis in analysing the facts ofVoth.He found that the appellant’s negligence did not lie in carelessness in auditing, but rather in failure to communicate the results of the audit to the respondents so as to reveal their liability to pay the withholding tax which occurred in New South Wales (seeVothat 151–152). 70 The plaintiff argues in its further written submissions thatVothis not good law in Singapore,66Foot Note 66×Plaintiff’s Further Written Submissions dated 3 October 2022 (“PFWS”) at para 5.and is of limited assistance. According to the plaintiff, the majority’s decision inVothis “questionable” because, among other things, it did not apply or consider the principles elucidated inJIO Mineralsat [91] and [93] for identifying the place of the tort in the context of misrepresentation.67Foot Note 67×PFWS at para 9.It appears that the plaintiff has conflated the tort of negligent misrepresentation with the tort of negligence. It is clear from the majority’s decision that “[each respondent company sued] for damages for thetort of negligence” [emphasis added] (seeVothat 127). I am cognisant that the majority inVothmade reference to the phrase “negligent misstatement”, for instance, when it stated at 144 that “[t]he present case is one that may be properly described either as a failure to advise (ie, an omission) or as a negligent misstatement of fact (ie, a positive act)”, but this is distinct from the tort of negligent misrepresentation. Further, it is unclear how the plaintiff’s argument (ie, that the principles inJIO Mineralsspecific to the tort of misrepresentation should be applied here) advances its case, given that the plaintiff’s pleaded case is one of negligence. In particular, the plaintiff has pleaded that “[t]he Partnership owed the [p]laintiff a duty of care to exercise reasonable skill and care … to be expected of reasonably skilled, competent and/or prudent auditors …”, the duty of care encompassed taking reasonable care to, among other things, “[a]ct in accordance with the applicable auditing standards in Australia …” and the Partnership had “negligently conducted its audit …”.68Foot Note 68×Statement of Claim (Amendment No 1) at paras 53A, 53B(c) and 53C.There is no allegation of misrepresentation against the Partnership. 71 In relation to the standard of care that is owed, the applicable accounting and auditing standards, being Australian, are connecting factors to Australia, even if it is accepted that they are largely similar to the standards in Singapore as counsel for the plaintiff contends (see [51(b)] above). The learned AR was correct to give due weight to the fact that the duty of care allegedly owed by the Partnership is based on Australia law and that the Partnership was bound by Australia auditing standards, which will determine if there was any wrongdoing on the Partnership’s part by virtue of their falling short of the standard of care required of them. 72 The plaintiff’s reliance on the possibility of transfer to the SICC to argue that Singapore is the proper forum is misplaced. The Court of Appeal held inMAN Diesel (CA)at [144] that: “… the good arguable case in favour of a transfer to the SICC, in and of itself, will not be sufficient to displace a foreign jurisdiction which is the more appropriate forum based on an application of the conventional connecting factors”. 73 As for the place where loss and damage was suffered, it is clear from the authorities that it is not determinative and may be of less significance in comparison to the place where the allegedly negligent/wrongful act took place. I find no reason to come to a different view in this case. 74 Finally, it is significant that various connecting factors that point towards Australia as the proper forum are also present in this case, as discussed below at [80]. Other connecting factors to Singapore and Australia 75 The plaintiff argues that the key witnesses, including Khua, the plaintiff’s finance team, the plaintiff’s special auditor, EY, the first defendant, and Tin are based in Singapore, and that Tin and the first defendant cannot be compelled to give evidence in any Australian proceedings.69Foot Note 69×PWS2 at paras 72–76.However, this argument fails to take into account the third defendant’s conduct of its defence, which would entail the admission of witness evidence of six named individuals whom the third defendant says were involved in the conduct of the audit by the third defendant that the plaintiff is complaining about.70Foot Note 70×D3WS at paras 38 and 45–46.In respect of the claim in negligence against the third defendant, besides the location of the witnesses, it is also necessary to consider the compellability of the witnesses to testify. Importantly, the six named individuals are no longer in the third defendant’s employ,71Foot Note 71×D3WS at para 38 and Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit dated 7 April 2022 (“Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit”) at paras 36–39.and are not compellable to give evidence in Singapore, because they are foreign witnesses who are not compellable by the Singapore courts to testify in a Singapore court (JIO Mineralsat [71]).On the other hand, if necessary, several of the plaintiff’s key witnesses are presumably willing to testify in Australia to advance the plaintiff’s case in Australia even if they are not compellable to give evidence there. These witnesses include Khua, the finance team in the plaintiff’s employ, and the persons involved in the special audit by EY engaged by the plaintiff.Furthermore, the evidence of the persons who conducted the audit by the third defendant is likely to be directly relevant and more critical to the claim that the third defendant was negligent in conducting the audit of Blackgold Australia and in preparing the audit report, compared to the evidence of the individuals based in Singapore who may be unwilling to testify in Australia. Those Singapore-based individuals, such as Tin and the first and second defendants, are unlikely to be in a position to shed much light on the manner in which the audit was conducted by the third defendant. 76 The plaintiff argues that absent any evidence or explanation as to the type, nature, relevance and/or significance of the evidence that the individuals who conducted the allegedly negligent audit will be giving for the third defendant’s defence, little to no weight should be placed on the third defendant’s arguments that those individuals may potentially be unavailable to give evidence.72Foot Note 72×PWS2 at para 78.On this point, the ruling of the Court of Appeal inJIO Minerals(at [67]) is instructive: …It would not be appropriate to require the Appellants to demonstrate exactlyhow they would use the testimony of the Indonesian Witnesses at this interlocutory stage. The Appellants have not yet prepared their Defence. We acknowledge, on the other hand, that a defendant applying for a stay should not be permitted to assert, without substantiation, that it requires foreign witnesses because that would make it easy for defendants to manufacture a connecting factor.Our view was that a defendant should at least show that evidence from foreign witnesses is at least arguably relevant to its defence. … [emphasis added] 77 In the present case, the third defendant has explained that the named individuals who conducted the audit reside in Australia and are no longer employed by the third defendant.73Foot Note 73×D3WS at paras 38 and 46.In my view, the evidence of those individuals is at least arguably relevant to the third defendant’s defence to the plaintiff’s action in negligence against the third defendant. 78 The plaintiff also argues that “the connection to Australia is significantly diluted due to the fact that parts of the audit may have been conducted in the PRC or Malaysia”.74Foot Note 74×PWS2 at para 82.In this regard, the plaintiff relies onSiemens AG vHoldrich Investment Ltd[2010] 3 SLR 1007, in which the Court of Appeal held (at [4]) that: … The purpose of theforumconveniensanalysis is to identify the most appropriate forum in which to try the substantive dispute. It is wrong to say that Singapore isforum nonconvenienssimply because the connecting factors which point to Singapore are outweighed by all the connecting factors which point away from Singapore. The connecting factors which point away from Singapore must point to a more appropriate forum than Singapore, and they might not do so if those connections are dispersed amongst several jurisdictions.Quite simply, Singapore isforum nonconveniensonly if there is a more appropriate forum than Singapore. 79 I am not persuaded by the plaintiff’s argument. As I have already explained above, the heart of the dispute between the plaintiff and the third defendant relates to the third defendant’s provision of professional services in Australia (see [63] above). That is not diminished by the fact that parts of the audit may have been conducted in the PRC or Malaysia. In any event, it is the plaintiff’s burden to show that Singapore is the proper forum. So, even if parts of the audit may have been conducted outside Australia, that does not assist the plaintiff in showing that Singapore is the proper forum, particularly when it is not the plaintiff’s case that any part of the third defendant’s audit was conducted in Singapore. 80 In my judgment, the learned AR was correct in concluding that the plaintiff failed to discharge its burden to show that Singapore is the proper forum, having regard to the various connecting factors. The third defendant is an Australia-incorporated company that does not have any business presence in Singapore.75Foot Note 75×Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit at paras 32–33.The Partnership was engaged to audit the FY 2016 financial report and to prepare the audit report via an Engagement Letter that is governed by Australia law and that contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the “Courts of Australia or that State”.76Foot Note 76×Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit at para 11(h) and p 37.I cannot agree with the plaintiff’s argument that the location of the parties to the contract between Blackgold Australia and the third defendant, and the governing law and exclusive jurisdiction clauses therein, are mere “red herring[s]”.77Foot Note 77×PWS2 at para 79.The plaintiff’s action against the third defendant is directed at the audit that flowed from this contract between Blackgold Australia and the Partnership. The location of the parties to the contract, the contract’s governing law, and the fact that the applicable standards required of the third defendant in conducting its audit emanate from Australia, are therefore important considerations even though the plaintiff is suing for negligence. 81 Finally, I also consider the indemnity clause incorporated in the contract between the Partnership and Blackgold Australia,78Foot Note 78×Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit at para 11(g) and p 32.which is governed by Australia law and contains an exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Australia courts. Pursuant to this indemnity clause, the Partnership is contractually entitled to bring third party proceedings or a counterclaim against Blackgold Australia to seek a contribution or indemnity. The learned AR observed (inVibrant Group Ltd 2at [37]) that the indemnity clause is a factor pointing towards Australia as the proper forum because any third party proceedings or counterclaims brought by the third defendant to seek a contribution or indemnity must be brought in Australia, in light of the exclusive jurisdiction clause in favour of the Australia courts. The learned AR nevertheless found that this factor was to be accorded less weight because whether any such proceedings will eventually be brought is speculative at this stage and in any event, the exclusive jurisdiction clause does not bind the plaintiff, who is not a party to the contract. The plaintiff takes issue with the learned AR’s observations, arguing that this factor is wholly irrelevant to the plaintiff’s claim against the third defendant because “no prejudice or injustice will be suffered by [the third defendant] even if it is required to bring indemnity proceedings against Blackgold Australia in Australia, while the [plaintiff’s] action against [the third defendant] is determined in Singapore”.79Foot Note 79×PWS2 at para 80.Considering the other connecting factors to Australia, the outcome of the analysis remains the same even if no weight is ascribed to this indemnity clause. The risk of re-litigation and conflicting decisions 82 I will turn next to deal with the arguments relating to the risk of re-litigation and conflicting decisions if the action by the plaintiff against the first and second defendants is to proceed in Singapore and the one against the third defendant is to proceed in Australia. 83 The second defendant refers to the learned AR’s decision to set aside the service out of jurisdiction orders in respect of the third defendant, which means that the plaintiff would have to pursue its claim against the third defendant in Australia. On that basis, the second defendant argues that given the “interconnectedness between the [plaintiff’s] claims against both the [first and second defendants as well as the third defendant]”, Australia would be the more proper forum for the trial of the main action.80Foot Note 80×D2WS at paras 98–100. 84 As for the plaintiff, it argues that its case against all three defendants relies largely on the same evidence in so far as they relate to the Alleged Misrepresentations by the first and second defendants and the Irregularities. The plaintiff makes the argument that “the falsity of the [first and second defendants’ representations] and the existence of the Irregularities areintrinsically relevantto the question of whether the Partnership had breached its duty of care to the [plaintiff] in failing to detect these untruths” [emphasis added].81Foot Note 81×PWS2 at para 66.In particular, counsel for the plaintiff provided, in the course of oral submissions, the example of having to argue for a second time before the Australia court that the first and second defendants made fraudulent (or negligent) misrepresentations that caused damage to the plaintiff, and take the risk that the Australia court may come to a different conclusion from the Singapore court.82Foot Note 82×Minute sheet in RA 92/2022 and RA 234/2022 dated 1 September 2022.Accordingly, the plaintiff argues that the real risk of conflicting decisions militates against the setting aside of the service out of jurisdiction order that was granted with respect to the third defendant. 85 Indeed, the existence of parallel proceedings and the consequent undesirability of two actions raising common issues being tried in two jurisdictions is relevant in determining the proper forum (see,eg,PTHutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Ltd and another[2001] 1 SLR(R) 104 at [24]). However, the weight to be given to the existence of parallel proceedings depends on the circumstances, which includes factors such as the degree of overlap of issues and parties and the degree to which the respective proceedings have advanced (VirsagiManagement (S) Pte Ltd v Welltech Construction Pte Ltd and another appeal[2013] 4 SLR 1097 at [39]). 86 The overlap between the plaintiff’s case against the first and second defendants and the plaintiff’s case against the third defendant should be considered in perspective based on the facts. In the action for fraudulent misrepresentation against the first and second defendants, the plaintiff has to establish five cumulative requirements as follows (PanatronPte Ltd and another v Lee Cheow Lee and another[2001] 2 SLR(R) 435 at [14]): (a) a false representation of fact by words or conduct;(b) the representation must be made with the intention that it should be acted upon by the plaintiff, or a class of persons which includes the plaintiff;(c) the plaintiff acted upon the false statement;(d) the plaintiff suffered damage by so doing; and(e) the representation must be made with the knowledge that it is false, or in the absence of any genuine belief that it is true. 87 As for the action in negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff would have to establish five cumulative elements as follows (YongKhong Yoong Mark and others v Ting Choon Meng and another[2021] SGHC 246 at [91]): (a) the representor made a false representation of fact to the representee;(b) the representation induced the representee’s actual reliance;(c) the representor owed the representee a duty to take reasonable care in making the representation;(d) the representor breached that duty of care; and(e) the breach caused damage to the representee. 88 On the facts of the present case, the inquiry would be focused on (for the purposes of the claims in both fraudulent and negligent misrepresentation): (a) whether the first and second defendants did make the Alleged Misrepresentations about Blackgold Australia’s value and business; (b) whether these representations were in fact false; (c) whether the plaintiff did proceed with the Acquisition because it relied on the representations; and (d) whether it suffered damage as a result. In respect of the claim in fraudulent misrepresentation, the first and second defendants’ states of mind at the time of making the representations would be in issue. In particular, the question would be whether they had knowledge of the falsity of their representations or lacked any genuine belief in their truth. Further, the inquiry would also focus on whether the first and second defendants intended for the plaintiff to proceed with the Acquisition in reliance on their representations. In respect of the claim in negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff would have to show that the first and second defendants owed the plaintiff a duty to take reasonable care in making the representations and that the first and second defendants breached that duty. 89 On the other hand, for the plaintiff’s claim in negligence against the third defendant, the plaintiff would have to establish five cumulative elements as follows (SpandeckEngineering (S) Pte Ltd v Defence Science & Technology Agency[2007] 4 SLR(R) 100at [21]): (a) the defendant owes the plaintiff a duty of care;(b) the defendant has breached that duty of care by acting (or omitting to act) below the standard of care required of it;(c) the defendant’s breach has caused the plaintiff damage;(d) the plaintiff’s losses arising from the defendant’s breach are not too remote; and(e) such losses can be adequately proved and quantified. The inquiry for the claim in negligence against the third defendant, in contrast to the inquiry for the claims in fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation against the first and second defendants, will be centred on what the Partnership was engaged to do, the level of skill that is to be expected of a reasonably competent auditor and the investigation or steps that would have been taken by a reasonably competent auditor to uncover “irregular or unusual matters” (Clerk & Lindsell on Torts(Sweet & Maxwell, 23rd Ed, 2020) at paras 9-231 to 9-232, citingPacific Acceptance Corporation Ltd v Forsyth(1970) 92 WN (NSW) 29 at 62). Contrary to what the plaintiff contends, in dealing with the plaintiff’s claim against the third defendant for professional negligence in its role as auditor, an Australia court would likely not need to determine any substantial issue about whether the first and second defendants in fact made any misrepresentations to induce the plaintiff to acquire Blackgold Australia. Rather, as submitted by the third defendant, the inquiry would be focused on whether a reasonable auditor in the same position as the Partnership would have reached the same conclusions which it arrived at.83Foot Note 83×D3WS at paras 154–157.The inquiry would be undertaken by examining, in the main, the financial and accounting records that were before the Partnership. It would focus on matters such as,eg, whether the auditor was put on inquiry by the existence of irregularities within the records (PlanAssurePAC (formerly known as Patrick Lee PAC) v Gaelic Inns Pte Ltd[2007] 4 SLR(R) 513 at [54], [65], [69], [73] and [77]) or whether the auditor failed to qualify its audit report when faced with the inability to obtain audit evidence (JSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd vTeofoongwonglcloong (a firm)[2007] 4 SLR(R) 460 at [113]).As provided by the contract between the Partnership and Blackgold Australia:84Foot Note 84×Kim Lawrence Perry’s Affidavit at para 11(d) and page 28. [The Partnership’s] work will be based on documents and information provided to it, or obtained by it in connection with the Services. [The Partnership] will not verify the accuracy and completeness of such documentation or information. The contractual clause provides context for the scope of the duty of care owed by the Partnership and goes towards showing that the Partnership’s duty did not extend to warranting against misrepresentations that would not have been detected by a reasonable auditor in the shoes of the Partnership. Seen in this context, the risk of re-litigation and conflicting decisions must not be overstated. 90 As for the plaintiff’s claims against the second defendant for fraudulent and/or negligent misrepresentation, not only do the connecting factors point to Singapore; the claims are also clearly more closely connected with the plaintiff’s claims against the first defendant based on the same causes of action than the claims against the third defendant based on negligence. The plaintiff’s claims against the second defendant should therefore be tried in Singapore together with the claims against the first defendant as there are common facts and issues involved. Indeed, if the plaintiff’s action against the first defendant were tried in Singapore but the plaintiff’s action against the second defendant were tried in Australia, that would lead to an even greater risk of conflicting decisions.",
        "Whether the service out of jurisdiction orders should be set aside because of the plaintiff’s failure to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts": "91 For completeness, I address the issue of the plaintiff’s alleged failure to make full and frank disclosure of all material facts in obtaining leave to serve the originating process on the third defendant outside Singapore. This is strictly not necessary given that I have affirmed the learned AR’s decision to set aside the service out of jurisdiction order in respect of the third defendant. 92 Before the learned AR, the third defendant took issue with the plaintiff’s omission to mention certain facts that point to the connection between the dispute and Australia. The learned AR found that the only such omission by the plaintiff was the failure to draw the court’s attention specifically to the exclusive jurisdiction clause in the Engagement Letter, which was, in his view, not a material omission, since the plaintiff had already disclosed other linkages to Australia and the plaintiff is not bound by the Engagement Letter nor the exclusive jurisdiction clause found therein (Vibrant Group Ltd 2at [47]). I have no reason to disagree with the learned AR’s exercise of discretion. 93 The third defendant also argues on appeal that the plaintiff had failed to state whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum. In addition, the defendant contends that the plaintiff had failed to state that it did not know where the audit was conducted.85Foot Note 85×D3WS at paras 173–179.As stated by the Court of Appeal inTay Long Kee Impexat [21], material facts are those which would have been material for the court to know in dealing with the application, and includes those facts that the applicant would have known if it had made proper inquiries. 94 In my view, the omission of the plaintiff to state whether Singapore was the more appropriate forum would be more appropriately regarded as a failure to substantiate a relevant factor in its application. By that omission, the plaintiff put its application at risk of a dismissal. As for the fact that the plaintiff did not know where the audit was conducted, I am unable to agree with the third defendant that the plaintiff’s lack of knowledge is itself material information which the court would necessarily have considered at theexpartestage, in deciding whether to grant the order for service out of jurisdiction. It would have had little bearing on whether the requirements to obtain leave to serve out of jurisdiction were satisfied. The circumstances of the case also do not suggest any deliberate attempt by the plaintiff to mischaracterise the situation or to convey any false impression that the issue of proper forum was not in dispute.",
        "RA 234/2022": "48 As mentioned (at [1] and [3]), the plaintiff is claiming against the third defendant for negligence in the Partnership’s audit. RA 234/2022 is the plaintiff’s appeal against the learned AR’s decision to set aside the service out of jurisdiction order in respect of the third defendant. 49 The key issue raised in RA 234/2022 is whether the learned AR erred in finding that Australia is the proper forum for the trial of the dispute between the plaintiff and the third defendant. The sub-issues are as follows: (a) whether the place of the tort is Singapore (or Australia);(b) whether the other connecting factors raised point towards Singapore as the proper forum for the dispute; and(c) whether there is a risk of conflicting decisions if the plaintiff’s claims against the first and second defendants continue in Singapore while its claim against the third defendant is pursued in Australia. 50 The learned AR had observed that there was no failure by the plaintiff to give full and frank disclosure, even though it was not necessary for the learned AR to make any finding on this issue, given his conclusions on the issue of the proper forum of the dispute.58Foot Note 58×[2022] SGHCR 8 at [47].Parties have addressed this point for completeness, and I will do the same below.",
        "Conclusion and orders made": "95 For the above reasons, I dismiss RA 92/2022 and RA 234/2022, and uphold the orders made by the learned AR. 96 I will hear parties on the question of costs separately.
