        "The Prosecution’s case": "2          The Prosecution and the Defence agreed on the matters set out in a Statement of Agreed Facts. The Statement reads: Statement of Agreed Facts 1          On 7 Jan 2004, acting on information received, a party of CNB officers were deployed to look for the accused at the vicinity of Block 115 Yishun Ring Road.  When they were at the vicinity, they saw a taxi SHA 7670 going into the carpark leading to Blocks 110 to 115 Yishun Ring Road with a passenger at the rear seat.  The taxi was thereafter seen leaving the carpark of Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road without the passenger inside. 2          At about 10.15 am, the CNB officers spotted the accused standing behind Blk 115 Yishun Ring Road and using his mobile phone.  The accused was at that time seen holding a red paper bag.  He thereafter walked to the exercise corner near Blk 115 and sat down on a wooden chair. 3          At about 10.45 am, the accused was spotted walking to the void deck of Blk 115 carrying the red paper bag.  He was then seen walking along the void deck of Blk 115 towards Blk 110 carrying a yellow paper bag in addition to the red bag.  He then proceeded towards Blk 110 Yishun Ring Road and entered a provision shop there. 4          After a while, he emerged from the provision shop holding the red paper bag, the yellow paper bag and an additional white plastic bag.  He was then seen standing along Yishun Ring Road waiting for a taxi.  At about 11.10 am, the accused person boarded taxi SHA 3884 X which travelled along Yishun Ring Road, Yishun Avenue 2, Lentor Avenue and from there, entered the Central Expressway (“CTE”). 5          The CNB officers trailed the accused in the taxi SHA 3884 X.  Subsequently, they received instructions to intercept the said taxi, and did so at the first available opportunity, when the taxi exited the CTE at about 11.30 am, long Upper Serangoon Road near Woodsville Close. 6          The accused was arrested while seated in the rear of the taxi.  At the time of the arrest, the red paper bag (containing the yellow paper bag) and the white plastic bag were found beside the accused person.  The CNB officers then escorted the accused in the taxi SHA 3884X to Puay Hee Avenue. 7          At Puay Hee Avenue in the taxi SHA 3884X, Senior Station Inspector Siew Lai Lone recorded a statement from the accused, in which the accused admitted ownership of red paper bag and confirmed that he was told that it contained 4 pounds of heroin.  The accused also informed SSI Siew that he was residing at No 2 Topaz Road #03-01 Topaz Mansion.",
        "The case for the Defence": "36        At the close of the Prosecution’s case in the afternoon of 14 September 2004, the accused was called upon to make his defence to the charge. Defence counsel requested that the proceedings be stood down to the next day for the accused to reconsider his intention to remain silent. 37        The next day, after conferring with both his counsel, the accused elected to remain silent and to call no witness to testify in his defence.",
        "The decision of the court": "38        The Prosecution relied on the following to prove its case: (a)        The presumption in s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2001 Rev Ed): (b)        The statements given by the accused to SSI Siew Lai Lone, SSG Ng and ASP Goh. (c)        The circumstantial evidence relating to the paraphernalia associated with drug trafficking. 39        The Prosecution’s evidence proved that the accused was in possession of the packets of the granular substance seized in the taxi and in the apartment in Topaz Mansion. The accused admitted as much in his various statements. 40        The Defence criticised the investigators for not having proved the chain of custody of the packets from arrest to analysis. However, I had no doubt that SSG Ng did take custody of the packets in the taxi and that he did bring them to the apartment where he handed them over to ASP Goh together with those found in the apartment after the latter arrived at Topaz Mansion and completed his investigations. No other drugs were seized before the CNB officers intercepted the taxi or while on the way to Topaz Mansion. There was therefore no issue of a mix-up somewhere along the way. Although SSG Ng could not recall the time when he handed over the packets to ASP Goh and although he did not record the handing over, I believed his testimony that the packets seized from the taxi were with him all the time until they were handed over. Similarly, there was no question of any mix-up where the packets found in the apartment were concerned. 41        SSG Ng was also criticised by the Defence for having brought the packets seized from “one crime scene to another” instead of bringing them back to the CNB store for safekeeping. It was argued that, by doing so, he could have caused a mix-up in the exhibits. As I have indicated above, I was satisfied that there was no mix-up. In any event, even if there had been a mix-up, it would have made no difference as the charge consolidated the drugs found in both places. 42        Similarly, I believed ASP Goh’s testimony that he took over the exhibits from SSG Ng and placed them into individual plastic bags before carting them back to the CNB office. There is no requirement that a written acknowledgement be given in respect of the handing over. ASP Goh has explained that he did not keep the exhibits in the CNB store because he wanted to bring them out later to weigh in the presence of the accused after the accused had gone through the administrative procedures and had his urine samples taken. I see no fault in that. When the drugs were weighed in the accused’s presence, there was no indication from him that there could not have been so much. When his statements under s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 1985 Rev Ed) were recorded on 10 January 2004, he admitted that the drugs in the taxi and in the apartment were his without qualifying the amount. 43        ASP Goh’s testimony that he took care that nothing else was in the safe and in the cabinet when he placed the exhibits therein has not been discredited in any way. He was the only one handling them and he ensured that the safe and the cabinet were locked each time he put the exhibits back in. There is no requirement that exhibits can only be taken out in the presence of accused persons. 44        The Defence argued that ASP Goh had referred to the drugs as a yellowish granular substance while the analyst from the Health Sciences Authority had described those received by her as a granular or powdery substance without specifying the colour. It asked whether there could have been a mix-up with other drug exhibits from other cases. I do not see a material difference in the two descriptions. Further, the analyst was cross-examined by the Defence and she was not asked why she had omitted the colour of the exhibits. 45        I found no gaps in the chain of evidence relating to the drugs in question. There was no doubt as to the identity of the drug exhibits. As the drugs proved to be in the possession of the accused have been analysed and found to contain a total of 226.57g of diamorphine, the presumption in s 17(c) of the Misuse of Drugs Act applied. This presumption states that any person proved to have had in his possession more than 2g of diamorphine shall be presumed to have had that drug in possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that drug was not for that purpose. The burden is therefore on the accused to rebut this presumption on a balance of probabilities. 46        The Defence submitted that three points emerged from the accused’s voluntary statements to ASP Goh. Firstly, he was consuming from the stock of heroin in his possession in Topaz Mansion. Secondly, he consumed whenever he wanted to do so. Thirdly, he consumed about 7.5g per day. It was argued that it was clear from the evidence of the two friends arrested in the apartment on 7 January 2004 that the accused was a “severe addict” who consumed heroin daily and at all times of the day. It was submitted that Dr Emran was not able to ascertain the rate of consumption from the withdrawal symptoms manifested by the accused. Similarly, while Dr Winslow said that there was a correlation between the rate of consumption and the withdrawal symptoms in the sense that a heavier user would experience a more rapid onset of symptoms and symptoms that lasted longer, he accepted that there was a small number of heavy users who might not exhibit severe withdrawal symptoms. 47        The Defence pointed out that Rajendran J inPP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa[1996] 1 SLR 783at 813, [125], doubted whether the position adopted by the prosecution there that the severity of drug addiction could be determined by reference to the severity of withdrawal was a sound one. That decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal: seePP v Dahalan bin Ladaewa[1995] SGCA 87. Since the accused was a severe addict who needed to consume about 7.5g of heroin a day, and considering the accused’s statement that he could not contact the supplier and that it was the supplier who would contact him, it was submitted that “it would be prudent to assume that the accused would want to hold on to his drug supplies and not be in a hurry to sell them off”. 48        It was clear that the accused was trafficking in heroin. His statements and the drug paraphernalia such as the weighing scale and the more than 3,000 empty plastic packets found in the apartment confirmed that fact. They buttressed rather than rebutted the presumption of trafficking. The Prosecution accepted that the accused was also a consumer of heroin. The issue, as I understand it from the Defence, was how much heroin was meant for trafficking and how much was meant for his consumption. InJusri bin Mohamed Hussain v PP[1996] 3 SLR 29, it was held that before any meaningful apportionment of drugs for the purposes of consumption and of trafficking can be made, there must be credible evidence that part of the drugs is meant for self-consumption. There must also be credible evidence of the rate of consumption as well as the number of days the supply is meant for. Credible evidence, the court held, does not mean the mere say-so of the accused. 49        The accused relied only on his statement to the investigating officer for the rate of his consumption and the fact that the heroin was from the stock that he possessed. This fell short of the test laid down inJusri’s case. There was therefore no evidence upon which a meaningful apportionment could be made of the heroin in his possession. On that ground alone, his defence failed. 50        I will nevertheless deal with the contentions raised by the Defence on the assumption that the rate of consumption was one packet of 7.5g a day. The accused’s statement indicated that he collected four pounds of heroin two weeks before his arrest on 7 January 2004. He accepted that the two pounds found in the apartment were the remainder of the four pounds obtained earlier. He said that each pound was repacked into approximately 56 smaller packets. Two pounds would have yielded 112 smaller packets. Assuming he did consume one packet per day for those 14 days, 98 smaller packets should have been left of the other two pounds. Instead, there were only eight smaller packets, two straws and a small container of heroin left. Even if these were regarded as comprising ten smaller packets, 88 smaller packets were still unaccounted for. The irresistible inference is that the accused trafficked in at least those 88 smaller packets. “Traffic”, as defined in s 2 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, includes “give” and therefore any gift of heroin to his two friends in the apartment would still be caught. 51        By the same token, the accused intended to and would have trafficked in some 88 smaller packets out of the 112 that he could repack from the remaining two pounds of heroin. He has chosen not to explain otherwise. 52        He would have done likewise with the four pounds of heroin that he was carrying in the taxi to the apartment. That had to be the case. He was unemployed. He owed money to loan sharks. He had to pay the supplier some $30,000 for the four pounds of heroin he was carrying in the taxi. Since each small packet of about 7.5g of heroin cost $300, he would have to sell at least 100 of such packets to raise $30,000. In addition, he had to pay the rent for the apartment and meet his other daily expenses. To pay the rent of $1,200 per month, he would have to sell at least four more of such packets every month. It would also be entirely commonsensical to presume he would sell a few more packets to meet his living expenses. 53        The minimum amount of heroin the accused had to sell for each batch of four pounds was therefore more than 104 packets of 7.5g each. That would amount to almost two pounds of heroin for trafficking. He had four pounds more on the second transaction. Those would yield 224 smaller packets (4 x 56). He could not have been hoarding for his own consumption more than seven months’ (ie, 224 days’) worth of supplies. The four pounds found in the taxi contained 149.1g of diamorphine. Even though the purity of the substance might not have been entirely uniform in the four packets, two pounds would contain about 74g of diamorphine. Although I accepted that he would consume some of the heroin, there was no chance that he was trafficking in only 15g or less of diamorphine, which would not attract the mandatory death penalty. I therefore amended the charge to include the words highlighted, much along the same lines as what was done inYeo Hee Seng v PP[1995] 1 SLR 193. 54        In addition to its submissions on the facts of the case, the Defence also contended that the mandatory death penalty provided in the Misuse of Drugs Act offends Art 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (1999 Rev Ed) which stipulates that “[a]ll persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal protection of the law”. The arguments on this point followed most of those canvassed inPP v Nguyen Tuong Van[2004] 2 SLR 328. In that case, Kan Ting Chiu J reasoned that the Defence there failed to establish that the mandatory death sentence was unlawful for contravening the Constitution or international law. The appeal against Kan J’s decision was heard before the Court of Appeal in July this year and judgment has been reserved. I agree with Kan J and adopt his reasoning in coming to the same conclusion in the present case. 55        Accordingly, I found the accused guilty on the amended charge and convicted him. Accused convicted on amended charge and sentenced to death"
