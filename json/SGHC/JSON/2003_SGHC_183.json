        "Conclusion": "46        This was a difficult case containing a convoluted factual matrix.  I was grateful for the assistance of both counsel.  At the end of the day, I was satisfied that the trial judge had not erred in convicting the appellant.  Therefore, I dismissed the appellant’s appeal after amending the second charge and allowed the prosecution’s appeal as to sentence on the first charge. Appellant’s appeal dismissed after amending the second charge. Public Prosecutor’s appeal against sentence allowed."
