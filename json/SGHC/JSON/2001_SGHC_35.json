        "BACKGROUND": "2.    This is a claim by AMS Securities (S) Pte Ltd (Amsteel\n\nSingapore) against its former chief executive officer (CEO) Thio Gwan Choon who was also an\n\nexecutive director, for losses sustained by it arising from transactions in 1997 of certain clients\n\nof Amsteel Singapore. The losses were substantial and Amsteel Singapores claim against Mr Thio as\n\nstated in its Statement of Claim was for about RM98.5m. In the course of the trial, this amount was\n\nreduced by about RM540,000.3.    Amsteel Singapore was part of a group of securities\n\ncompanies collectively known as the Amsteel Securities group. It was incorporated in January 1996 as\n\na 100% wholly owned subsidiary of Amsteel Securities Philippines Inc, which was in turn wholly owned\n\nby Amsteel Holdings Philippines Inc. This company was in turn wholly owned by Amsteel Capital\n\nHoldings Sdn Bhd (Amsteel Capital), which operates as the headquarters of the Amsteel\n\nSecurities group. This group was part of the Lion group.4.    The matters stated in paras 5 to 9 below are from evidence\n\nfrom one Lee Tak Suan. Mr Lee was the Group President of the Amsteel Securities group. I will refer\n\nto him also as GP.5.    GPs experience with the stockbroking business started\n\nwhen he became a shareholder of a stockbroking company in Kuala Lumpur in 1973. In 1983, he sold out\n\nhis stake and left this industry for five to six years. Thereafter he joined a broking house in\n\nThailand belonging to Standard Chartered Bank. He worked there for three and a half years and ended\n\nhis stay there as Managing Director. He came back to Malaysia in 1993 and joined the Lion group\n\nwhere he became the General Manager of the Malaysian stockbroking arm ie. Amsteel Securities\n\nMalaysia Sdn Bhd (ASMSB). Six to eight months later in 1993, he was appointed as ASMSBs\n\nManaging Director.6.    The objective of the Amsteel Securities group was to build a\n\nregional securities group specialising in securities in the Far East, and providing a one-stop\n\nfinancial services centre encompassing securities dealing, asset management, and corporate finance\n\nto both retail and corporate clients. For that reason, securities companies were set up in Malaysia,\n\nHong Kong, Philippines, Indonesia, Bangkok and London as well as in Singapore.7.    Amsteel Singapore was incorporated with the primary purpose\n\nof carrying on business as stock, shares and bond brokers and dealers, with an authorised capital of\n\nS$20m, and paid up capital of S$5m.8.    The role of Amsteel Singapore was to provide a strategic\n\nlink to the Amsteel Securities groups international network and to facilitate transactions in\n\nsecurities quoted on various stock exchanges in which the companies within the Amsteel Securities\n\ngroup operated. The clients whom Amsteel Singapore was targeting were mainly European, North\n\nAmerican, East and South East Asian based financial or investment investors and HNWIs, as well as\n\ninvestors in Singapore who wished to transact in securities quoted outside Singapore.9.    In the initial stages, the plan was for Amsteel Singapore to\n\nfocus on transactions in securities quoted on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). Amsteel\n\nSingapore would offer investors the direct option of transacting securities quoted on the KLSE, as\n\nopposed to trading in CLOB companies quoted on the Singapore Stock Exchange (SES). This would\n\nbe done through investors opening trading accounts with Amsteel Singapore, who would then trade\n\nthrough their own corporate trading accounts with Malaysian firms having a licence to deal in\n\nsecurities quoted on the KLSE.10.    A Mission Statement prepared by Mr Thio on 9 April 1997\n\nstates:Mission StatementMaximise shareholders value through the provision of high quality broking\n\n  servicesprimarily on Malaysian shares.Medium term goals: (2-3 years)1) Secure the largest market share of Malaysian trades originating from\n\n  Singapore.2) Establish the largest (sic) member of independent dealers for a foreign broking firm.3) .4) .5) .Short term goals (1-2 years):-1) Establish the most competitive incentive system to attract productive\n\n  dealers & efficient support staff. (Outline in Competitive analysis, Marketing Plan).2) .3) .[Emphasis added.]11.    GP agreed that he had approved the Mission Statement (NE\n\n27A). However he denied that the primary purpose of Amsteel Singapore was to trade in Malaysian\n\nshares On KLSE (NE 27B). I find that that was Amsteel Singapores primary purpose or at least\n\ninitially so as admitted by GP (see para 9 above).12.    ASMSB was the first securities company owned by the Lion\n\ngroup. When the group bought the company in about 1991, it was already an operating company.13.    According to GP (at NE 9E), ASMSB had had a very bullish\n\n1993 and 1994 and the Lion group was emboldened to become a major player in the securities\n\nindustry. His vision was to develop this business into a regional business.14.    Amsteel Singapore applied for and was granted a non-member\n\ndealers licence by the Monetary Authority of Singapore on 12 May 1997, which licence was valid\n\nfor one year. As a non-member dealer, Amsteel Singapore was allowed to deal only in securities not\n\nlisted or quoted on the SES. GP was a director of Amsteel Singapore as well as the other regional\n\nsecurities companies in the group.15.    Mr Thio was a graduate from the National University of\n\nSingapore in 1985. He had an accounting degree. After his graduation, he joined Citibank NA as a\n\nManagement Associate. In 1986, he was promoted to be Operations Manager of a Citibank futures\n\nbroking subsidiary.16.    In 1988, he was headhunted to join Lim & Tan Pte (Lim\n\n& Tan) as its Operations Manager. Subsequently he assumed the role of a dealer cum manager of\n\nbusiness development in Lim & Tan. In 1993, he was an independent dealer, servicing both retail\n\nand institutional clients.17.    In 1997, he has headhunted by T.A.O. Group (Malaysia) Sdn\n\nBhd (T.A.O.) to join Amsteel Singapore as its CEO.18.    Mr Thio was interviewed by GP and the Regional Operations\n\nManager Choong Boon Pin. On the report from T.A.O. about Mr Thio, Mr Choong wrote, inter alia, the\n\nfollowing: Obvious marketing man. Very enthusiastic.19.    GP agreed with this observation (NE 25A).20.    The terms of Mr Thios employment were stated in a letter\n\ndated 21 February 1997 from Amsteel Capital. The terms of employment provided, inter alia, that he\n\nwas to report directly to GP.21.    GP described some of the duties of Mr Thio (at NE 37) as\n\nfollows:Q What other duties were specifically given to Defendant?A He was the CEO of the Singapore office. Given our philosophy of developing a\n\n  regional group, his task was very entrepreunial. We had provided support by exposing him to office\n\n  operations. He was tasked to recruit dealers and remisiers. He was tasked to manage the business\n\n  with risk adverse policies. Amsteel wanted to grow in the region and be a significant player in\n\n  the long term.22.    Mr Thios employment with Amsteel Singapore commenced on\n\nor about 28 May 1997. Prior to that, in April 1997, he attended an orientation session at the office\n\nof Amsteel Capital.23.    Various other persons were employed for Amsteel Singapore:(a) Lim Kim Siah - Operations Manager(b) Alex Chong How Keit - Finance & Administration manager(c) Tan Chin Poh - Research Manager.24.    Mr Thio said that the Credit Committee of Amsteel Singapore\n\ncomprised these three managers but a witness Mr Anthony Lye Chee Fei said it was made up of these\n\nthree and headed by Mr Thio. From the documentary evidence eg. DSB 59, I find that the Credit\n\nCommittee comprised these three managers.25.    The losses which are the subject of the claim by Amsteel\n\nSingapore arose from trades done by four groups of clients, as classified by Amsteel Singapore,\n\nnamely:(a) the Dato Jerry Goh group (comprising five individuals),(b) the Tai Kar group (comprising five individuals),(c) Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh Choon, and(d) Tan Hun Leong @ Tan Han Kiang.26.    The first two groups were serviced by Mr Lye and the last\n\ntwo groups were serviced by Christian Yuei-Chen Wu.27.    Mr Lye was employed as Amsteel Singapores Associate\n\nDirector - Independent Dealer on 22 July 1997.28.    He obtained a Bachelor of Business in Business\n\nAdministration degree from Melbourne University. He started work in Vickers Ballas in about 1991 as\n\na dealer.29.    I would digress briefly to point out that the term dealer\n\nis not used consistently.30.    Under the Securities Industry Act (Ch 289) (the Act)\n\na dealer refers to the stockbroking company.31.    However, in industry parlance, a dealer refers to an\n\nindividual who is employed by the stockbroking company to deal in securities. In this judgment, the\n\nterm dealer is used in this sense. A dealer is different from a remisier who is not employed,\n\nbut is engaged, by the stockbroking company. The term remisier is not used in the Act.32.    Both a dealer and a remisier, as understood by\n\nthe industry, come within the definition of a dealers representative in the Act.33.    Coming back to My Lye, he was seconded to London, after one\n\nand a half years, to set up an office there and was there for also about one and a half years. He\n\nreturned to Singapore in about 1994 or 1995. He then joined Ong & Company Private Limited (Ong\n\n& Company) as a director of a dealing team for one and a half to two years and then joined\n\nAmsteel Singapore. Therefore, by the time he joined Amsteel Singapore, he had about six years\n\nexperience as a dealer. He was doing well in Vickers Ballas and in Ong & Company and he admitted\n\nthat he was one of the top dealers of Ong & Company. It must have been quite a coup for Amsteel\n\nSingapore to have obtained his services.34.    Mr Wu was employed as a dealer by Amsteel Singapore about\n\none month after Mr Lye on 26 August 1997. He was highly recommended by one Chia Seng who was at that\n\ntime the head of a Citibank unit which was one of Amsteel Singapores valued clients.35.    Mr Wu graduated in 1992 from the University of Southern\n\nCalifornia with a Bachelor of Arts, Economics degree. Prior to joining Amsteel Singapore, he worked\n\nas a trading executive in two companies and a project director in a company in China.36.    Amsteel Singapore commenced operations on 28 July 1997.\n\nFrom August to October 1997, Amsteel Singapore was making profits, contrary to the expectation of\n\nGP, as GP had expected Amsteel Singapore, as a new start up, to start by making losses initially.37.    In November 1997, Amsteel Singapore made huge losses in the\n\nsense that some of its clients suffered huge losses for their purchases of securities for which they\n\ndid not pay Amsteel Singapore.38.    The losses arose from transactions of the four groups of\n\nclients which I have mentioned above.39.    According to Mr Thio, the losses arose because of the\n\nseverity of the regional economic crisis which hit Amsteel Singapore and other stockbroking houses\n\nfrom 20 November 1997. His position was that the severity of the crisis was not reasonably\n\nforeseeable.40.    According to Amsteel Singapore, the losses were caused by\n\nMr Thios failure to comply with certain specific requirements and directions of the Amsteel\n\nSecurities group and Mr Thios failure to exercise due diligence and to act in good faith,\n\nalthough Amsteel Singapore accept that the 1997 regional economic crisis was also a cause of the\n\nlosses.41.    As a result of the losses, ASMSB did not renew its\n\nnon-members licence after the first year.",
        "WITNESSES AND INVESTIGATION REPORT": "42.    Amsteel Singapore relied on four witnesses:(a) GP (PW1)(b) Mr Loo Peng Hock (PW2)(c) Mr Lye (PW3)(d) Ms Tan Chitt Loo Elsie (PW4)I have already mentioned something about GP and Mr Lye.43.    As for Mr Loo, he started work in 1981 in Public Bank\n\nBerhad in Malaysia. In 1994 he worked in OSK Securities Sdn Bhd. In October 1996 he joined Amsteel\n\nCapital and he was at all material times the Group Operations Manager. On 1 May 1999, he became the\n\nGeneral Manager of ASMSB.44.    As for Ms Tan, she was at all material times the Group\n\nAudit Manager of the Lion group of which the Amsteel Securities group is part. At the time of the\n\ntrial, she was the Chief Internal Auditor of the Lion group.45.    (a) On 19 December 1997, the directors of Amsteel Singapore\n\npassed a resolution to appoint a Domestic Inquiry Committee to carry out an investigation to, inter\n\nalia, ascertain whether there was any breach of company policies and determine whether there was any\n\nunlawful act by its officials. Ms Tan headed the committee which undertook this investigation. The\n\nother members of the committee were one Wong Kok Liang, Mr Loo and one Lim Yew Meng (who was the new\n\nGroup Compliance Manager from November 1997).(b) Ms Tan was first informed on or about 19 December 1997 that she was to head\n\nthis committee. She and her audit team attended a meeting with GP, Wong Kok Liang, Mr Loo and Lim\n\nYew Meng at ASMSBs office for this purpose. Mr Thio was not present at this meeting although he\n\nwas a party to the resolution appointing the committee.46.    Ms Tan and her audit team spent only two days in Singapore\n\nfor the investigation. They went to Singapore on 23 December 1997 and returned to Kuala Lumpur on 24\n\nDecember 1997. The report was also completed very shortly thereafter. It is dated 29 December 1997\n\nand was sent with a cover letter dated 29 December 1997 addressed to the board of directors of\n\nAmsteel Singapore. It was a short two page report with various enclosures which included statements\n\nfrom Mr Thio, Mr Lye and Mr Wu.47.    The first paragraph of the report states:IntroductionThe CEO of AMSS [meaning Amsteel Singapore] over the period October to December\n\n  1997 in the course of its trading has approved trades and credit limits of clients exceeding what\n\n  are considered to be prudent limits and as a result has caused AMSS to incur substantial potential\n\n  bad and doubtful debts in respect of realised and unrealised contra losses amounting to RM 51\n\n  million and RM 52 million respectively in its clients account. Arising from this, the Board of\n\n  AMSS on 19thDecember 1997 appointed the Investigating Committee comprising Ms Tan\n\n  Chitt Loo (Elsie), Mr Wong Kok Liang, Mr Loo Peng Hock and Mr Lim Yew Meng to investigate the\n\n  affairs of AMSS relating to these trades and credit limits and to report thereon to the Board.48.    The last paragraph of the report states:Our investigation clearly shows that the Chief Executive Officer Mr Thio\n\n  Gwan Choon in managing AMSS has not discharged his responsibilities befitting a CEO and the trust\n\n  given to him by the Group Management by not exercising due diligence and care and not prudently\n\n  managing his risks when granting overriding approvals for exceptionally large amount of trades and\n\n  consistently allowing roll over of large trades which exposed AMSS to high risks far exceeding the\n\n  financial resources of AMSS and the capability of a newly (sic) set company.49.    Mr Thio said that he did not receive a copy of Ms Tans\n\nreport. Neither was he informed about its contents nor was he told thereafter of any wrongdoing on\n\nhis part. Mr Thio also said that he did not realise that he was the subject of the investigation.50.    Mr Alvin Yeo SC, counsel for Amsteel Singapore, suggested\n\nto Mr Thio that Mr Thio must have been aware that he was the subject of the investigation since he\n\nwas a party to the resolution but Mr Thio denied he was aware. He had thought that Mr Lye and Mr Wu,\n\nthe two dealers, were the subject of the investigation as they had been suspended before the\n\nresolution was passed.51.    Mr Thio also said that he had no inkling that Amsteel\n\nSingapore was considering making a claim against him until more than two years later when he learned\n\nabout the present claim against him. He had tendered his resignation on 9 February 1998 and had seen\n\nGP about his resignation. He said GP was very cordial about the parting and expressed regret that\n\nthey had worked together for a short time because the regional economic crisis had hit unexpectedly.52.    I should also mention that in the period between Mr Thios\n\nresignation and the commencement of the present action, Mr Thio had assisted Amsteel Singapore in\n\nits claims against some of its clients for their trading losses and had sworn some affidavits for\n\nAmsteel Singapore.53.    I accept Mr Thios evidence on the points mentioned in\n\nparas 49 to 51 above. Although he was a party to the resolution, the true purpose for appointing the\n\ncommittee was hidden from him.54.    At this stage, I would mention some points which I consider\n\nto be material.55.    Some allegations made against Mr Thio in the trial were not\n\nmentioned specifically in Ms Tans report or advocated by the witnesses for Amsteel Singapore.\n\nThey were arguments of Mr Yeo.56.    In so far as some allegations were made by the witnesses\n\nfor Amsteel Singapore, none of these witnesses were independent witnesses. They were persons who had\n\nbeen and, in the case of Mr Loo and Ms Tan, still were in the employ of the Amsteel Securities group\n\nat the time of trial.57.    In view of that, it was important to consider what other\n\ncompanies in the Amsteel Securities group were doing at the material time. For this purpose, ASMSB\n\nwas the best comparison because it too was trading in shares on the KLSE.58.    Mr Yeo argued that even if ASMSB was guilty of the very\n\nsteps or omissions which Mr Thio was accused of, this did not necessarily exculpate Mr Thio in law.\n\nWhile this is true, it is still a factor I should not ignore.59.    Furthermore in so far as Amsteel Singapore was relying on\n\nevidence of certain witnesses, who should be aware of what was happening in ASMSB, in order to\n\nestablish its allegations against Mr Thio, then evidence of ASMSBs practices becomes material as\n\nit may affect the credibility of the witnesses.60.    As for the witnesses for Mr Thio, they were:(a) Mr Thio himself (DW1)(b) Ms Esther Seet(c) Mr Deepak Lakhi Ramchandaris (Mr Ram)61.    I have already mentioned something about Mr Thio.62.    As for Ms Seet and Mr Ram, Mr Yeo did not require to\n\ncross-examine them and it was agreed that their evidence be treated as admitted without their having\n\nto attend court.63.    Ms Seet qualified as a Chartered Accountant in 1980. She\n\nstarted work in Peat Marwick Mitchell & Co, as it was then known, till about July 1981. She then\n\njoined Lim & Tan as a Finance & Operations Manager and became a General Manager. She then\n\nbecame an Executive Director of Lim & Tan in 1993.64.    Mr Ram obtained a Bachelor of Business (Hons) Degree in\n\n1993 from the National Technological University of Singapore. He was a house dealer of Lim & Tan\n\nfrom October 1993 to February 1997 when he joined J M Sassoon & Co (Pte) Ltd. In April 1997, he\n\njoined Amsteel Singapore. He was retrenched by Amsteel Singapore in July 1998 and became an\n\nAssociate Director with Fraser Securities Pte Ltd.65.    Many allegations were made against Mr Thio and I will\n\nconsider each of them in some detail. The burden is on Amsteel Singapore to establish its\n\nallegations and to prove causation.",
        "OPERATIONS MANUAL": "66.    It was initially suggested by Amsteel Singapore that Mr\n\nThio was tasked to ensure that Amsteel Singapore produce an operations manual similar to the one\n\nthat ASMSB had, and that since such an operations manual had not been prepared by Amsteel Singapore,\n\nMr Thio had failed in his duty.67.    However, this point was not pursued by Mr Yeo in his\n\nclosing submissions.68.    In any event, I would say that I do not think it was right\n\nfor Amsteel Singapore to have even taken this point initially, even if, for the sake of argument, Mr\n\nThio was indeed tasked to ensure the production of this manual.69.    Firstly, ASMSB itself had taken a long time ie. three years\n\nafter GP had become MD of ASMSB to produce its operations manual (NE 41C). Although ASMSBs\n\noperations manual could be used as a guide by Mr Thio to prepare the manual for Amsteel Singapore,\n\nMr Thio obviously had a lot on his hands in 1997 with a new start-up, and it was not unreasonable\n\nfor him to start with operations in Singapore first and then follow up with the production of an\n\noperations manual for Amsteel Singapore. This was all the more so when Amsteel Singapore was allowed\n\nto commence trading without anyone in Amsteel Capital insisting that its operations manual must be\n\ncompleted first.70.    Secondly, Amsteel Singapore was not able to suggest any\n\ncausal link between the absence of the operations manual and the losses suffered.",
        "LETTER OF AUTHORITY CHART (LAC)": "71.    The Amsteel Securities group had an LAC for each of its\n\nregional offices which sets out the limits of authority for each office.72.    For Amsteel Singapore, a draft LAC was discussed and this\n\nwas finalised on 27 October 1997. Although Mr Yeo asked some questions about the draft LAC, his\n\nfocus was on the finalised LAC.73.    The finalised LAC for Amsteel Singapore stated, inter alia,\n\nthe following (at AB 538):(a) For an application where the trading limit was more than RM2m (or S$1m),\n\n  this was to be approved by CEO, GP to be advised in writing. CEO referred to Mr Thio.(b) This same requirement applied to trades which were more than RM1m (or\n\n  S$500,000) in excess of the approved trading limit.74.    Amsteel Singapore had two interpretations of this\n\nrequirement.75.    The first interpretation was that GP had to be advised by\n\nMr Thio in writing before a trading limit of more than RM2m was granted or before trades up to that\n\nlimit could be executed. Likewise, GP had to be advised by Mr Thio in writing before a client was\n\nallowed to engage in a trade which would exceed his limit by more than RM1m.76.    The second interpretation was that even if GP did not have\n\nto be advised in writing before the event, this had to be done after the event.77.    Mr Thios position was that he had read the finalised LAC\n\nto mean the second interpretation.78.    Also, he was not clear as to how the requirement to advise\n\nGP in writing was to be implemented. He said he had checked with Mr Loo but Mr Loo himself was\n\nuncertain. Mr Loo did not deny this discussion but said only that he could not remember it (NE 210D\n\nto F).79.    Mr Thio then had his own meeting with the management of\n\nAmsteel Singapore on 14 November 1997. Following that meeting, an e-mail dated 18 November 1997 was\n\nsent by Anita Chong, a Credit Administrator of Amsteel Singapore to GP (AB 542 to 544) with a list\n\nof the clients who had a trading limit of RM2m and over but one name was omitted ie. Tan Poh Choon.\n\nMr Yeo suggested that the omission was deliberate. I do not agree. It was an inadvertent omission.\n\nThere was no reason for Mr Thio to be prepared to have the other names listed but not Tan Poh Choons.80.    The e-mail from Anita Chong dated 18 November 1997 was the\n\nonly written notification given to GP after 27 October 1997, the date when the LAC was finalised. Mr\n\nYeo argued that this response was unreasonably slow. I am of the view that Mr Yeo was trying to find\n\nfault with Mr Thio. It must be remembered that Mr Thio was left to guess how the written feedback to\n\nGP was to be implemented and even Mr Loo could not assist him. Furthermore GP did not complain that\n\nthe written response was unreasonably slow.81.    I find that Amsteel Singapore has failed to make out the\n\nfirst interpretation for various reasons.82.    Firstly, in so far as it relied on the evidence of GP and\n\nMr Loo and Ms Tan, such evidence was unconvincing and, to some extent, inconsistent.83.    For example, at NE 46A to D, GP said:A A proposal of limits of authority chart was submitted to Defendant. I\n\n  cannot remember the exact time this was done. He was given authority to allow clients to open\n\n  accounts with the company up to S$2 million or RM2 million.Q How was that supposed to work?A There was a chart which authorises different levels of officers to different\n\n  limits. For the CEO of Singapore, it was S$2 million or RM2 million.Q What is the limit?A It is the limit up to which he can approve.Q Above 2 million he has no authority to approve?A I agree.Q Who has authority to approve?A He has to come back to me for approval.84.    Yet, at NE 80, GP said:Q Refer to AB 533, item 3. For amounts above S$2 million, they are to be\n\n  recommended by Credit/Margin Administrator and approved by CEO and Group President to be advised?A It is written there.Q This does not accord with what you had said earlier which was that for\n\n  amounts above S$2 million, only you can approve?A I agree.85.    As regards Mr Loos evidence, at NE 210C he said:Q Do you agree that the LAC did not say that the Group President must be\n\n  advised in writing before the Defendant gives the approval?A Agree.86.    Then at NE 212B to E, he said:Q As regards the transaction referred to in your AEIC, para 99, it would be\n\n  covered by item 2 of PSB 45?A Disagree.Q Why?A Based on LAC, Group President has to be advised in writing prior to approval\n\n  by Defendant. Defendant was granted discretion of RM2 million. Anything above that he had to\n\n  obtain prior approval from Group President.Q You are mistaken because the requirement is not prior approval?A Disagree.87.    As for Ms Tan, I have considered her evidence at NE 302C to\n\n304C.88.    I am of the view that Ms Tan did not have personal\n\nknowledge as to how the terms in the LAC for Amsteel Singapore had come about. She was basing her\n\nevidence on what she knew generally and the basis of her general knowledge was vague.89.    Secondly, if the written advice to GP was to be given\n\nbefore the event, this could and would have been stated so as was the case for the regional office\n\nin the Philippines. For that office, the LAC effective 11 June 1997 stated:Above 10,000,000 [pesos] - Group President to be informed in writingpriorto approval of transaction.[Emphasis added.]90.    Thirdly, in a memorandum dated 4 December 1997 from Lim Yew\n\nMeng to Mr Thio, Lim Yew Meng took Mr Thio to task for not giving written notice after the event.\n\nThe first paragraph thereof states:SUBJECT : Non Compliance of Limit of AuthorityI refer to the Limit of Authority (LAC) issued to AMS Securities (S) Pte Ltd\n\n  which states that while the trading limit for an individual/institutional client in excess of RM 2\n\n  million and any trading in excess of RM 1 million above the approved limit can be approved by you,\n\n  you are required to advise the Group President, Mr Lee Tak Suan in writing of these approvals.91.    This memorandum, which was sent with the knowledge of GP,\n\ndid not allude to the first interpretation at all but rather the second interpretation.92.    Mr Thio replied to Lim Yew Meng by telefax dated 8 December\n\n1997. The telefax states:The Limit of Authority (LCA) was issued to AMS Securities (S) Pte Ltd only\n\n  in November 1997. The format and frequency of advising/ reporting was still in the process of\n\n  being finalised. The implementation details and timing was still being discussed with Mr Loo Peng\n\n  Hock.In respect of clients credit limits exceeding RM2 million, Anita of Credit\n\n  Administration, on the 18 November 1997 faxed a list to the Group President via Catherine.At all times, Group Operations & Compliance will have remote access to all\n\n  our trades and credit limit.93.    Lim Yew Meng then sent another memorandum to Mr Thio dated\n\n10 December 1997.94.    The second paragraph of the memorandum dated 10 December\n\n1997 states:2. In respect of Anita Chongs memo of 18/11/97 attaching a list of\n\n  clients requiring Mr Lee Tak Suans approval, I would like to point out that there was already a\n\n  number of transactions exceeding RM 2 million allowed by you after the date of issue of the LAC\n\n  but prior to Anita Chongs memo of 18/11/97 (see attached list). In other words the advice of\n\n  the credit limits exceeding RM 2 million was in retrospect of transactions exceeding RM 2 million\n\n  approved by you. You should have allowed a couple of days after Anita Chongs memo for Mr Lee\n\n  Tak Suans response to seek Mr Lee Tak Suans response by phone before you consider allowing\n\n  such transactions in view of the substantial amount involved.95.    It was only in this later memorandum that the first\n\ninterpretation was first alluded to. I am of the view that this was an afterthought.96.    However, Mr Yeo referred to the e-mail dated 18 November\n\n1997 from Anita Chong which stated:In compliance with Limits of Authority, attached is a list requiring [GPs]\n\n  approval.We will forward more information upon Mr Lees request.97.    He argued that the reference to GPs approval supported\n\nthe first interpretation rather than the second.98.    I do not agree with Mr Yeos argument. The word approval\n\nmeant that GP could disagree if he so wished and give the necessary directions but it did not mean\n\nthat no transaction could be carried out until GP had approved the trading limits.99.    I also refer to GPs handwritten comments on Anita Chongs\n\ne-mail which read:Lim Yew Meng/Loo Peng Hock(1) I do not wish to approve in retrospect.(2) Individual clients in respect of more than 500k - cash a/c. I need to know\n\n  the financial background.(3) As a matter of policy, no trading of stocks for syndicates.(4) Give capital base, daily.Exposures/trading to be limited.Also consider the realised losses in review.(5) Above, topic for discussion on corporate policy and controls to be (sic)\n\n  implement.100.    I should mention that the trial proceeded on the basis\n\nthat his handwritten comments were written contemporaneously and not as an afterthought.101.    If GPs approval had to be sought before such trading\n\nlimits were granted, GP would have expressed surprise when he received the e-mail because the e-mail\n\nsuggested that the trading limits had already been granted and acted upon. GP did not express any\n\nsurprise. Neither did he send a written reply to Amsteel Singapore to grant approval which he would\n\nsurely have done if he had thought Amsteel Singapore was awaiting his approval.102.    Mr Thio also said that before this e-mail was sent, he had\n\nkept GP informed orally of developments regularly when he spoke to GP two or three times a week. GP\n\ndenied this.103.    Mr Yeo argued that Mr Thios evidence on this point was\n\nnot true. He referred to Mr Thios reply to Lim Yew Meng dated 8 December 1997, the contents of\n\nwhich have been stated in para 92 above.104.    Mr Yeo said that if indeed Mr Thio had been keeping GP\n\ninformed orally then this should have been stated in Mr Thios reply but it was not.105.    However, I note that Lim Yew Mengs earlier memorandum\n\ndated 4 December 1997 to Mr Thio, the contents of which are stated in para 90 above, was on the\n\nabsence of written notification to GP and Mr Thio was responding to that.106.    Besides, Amsteel Singapore was a new start up. GP must\n\nhave been interested to know what was happening there and could not have been so much in the dark as\n\nhe would have me believe.107.    I find that Mr Thio did keep GP regularly informed orally\n\nof trading limits which were RM2m or above but he may have overlooked mentioning some.108.    I also doubt if Mr Thio actually orally provided GP with\n\ndetails of each and every trade in excess of the existing trading limits by more than RM1m. Based on\n\nthe trades shown to me just for the four groups of clients, let alone the entire operations of\n\nAmsteel Singapore, the clients were allowed to exceed their respective trading limits quite\n\nfrequently. In view of the frequency, I do not think that Mr Thio would have mentioned to GP every\n\noccasion for every client when each trading limit was exceeded by more than RM1m.109.    However the omission was not deliberate.110.    Coming back to Anita Chongs e-mail, I note that\n\nalthough it did provide a list of clients whose trading limits were RM2m or above, it did not list\n\nthose clients whose trades exceeded their limits by RM1m.111.    Again I do not think this omission was deliberate.112.    Anita Chongs e-mail dated 18 November 1997 was a follow\n\nup from a management meeting of Amsteel Singapore on 14 November 1997. The minutes thereof suggest\n\nthat Mr Thio and his management had thought that they were complying with the LAC by providing GP\n\nwith the list of clients whose trading limits were RM2m or above.113.    Mr Yeo argued that the failure to observe the LAC is\n\nsymptomatic of Mr Thios lack of risk management. I do not agree. Mr Thio was aware of his duty to\n\nkeep GP informed and to manage risks. Any omission of his part to comply with the LAC was not\n\ndeliberate or reckless as was being suggested.114.    Mr Thio relied on two other points regarding the knowledge\n\nof GP as giving rise to an estoppel or acquiescence. Mr Thios position was that aside from his\n\noral discussions with GP and Anita Chongs e-mail, GP had the means to know and in fact knew all\n\nalong about the details of the trading activities of the clients because (a) the TRACS 400 system of\n\nAmsteel Singapore was linked to ASMSBs TRACS 400 system and (b) reports were regularly sent by\n\nAmsteel Singapore to GP.",
        "TRACS 400 system": "115.    Amsteel Singapore had a computer system known as TRACS\n\n400. This was the same system that ASMSB had been using.116.    According to Mr Thio, ASMSB had direct access to the\n\ninformation in Amsteel Singapores TRACS 400 through two avenues and was therefore aware all along\n\nabout the trades of the clients of Amsteel Singapore.117.    The first avenue, according to Mr Thio, was the alleged\n\nconnection by a lease line or lines between the TRACS 400 system in Amsteel Singapores back\n\noffice and the TRACS 400 system in ASMSBs back office. In addition, Mr Thios position was that\n\nbecause the office of Amsteel Capital was on the second floor of the same building as ASMSB ie.\n\nWisma Amsteel Securities, while ASMSBs operating offices were on the third and fourth floors,\n\nAmsteel Capital could and did have access to information in Amsteel Singapores TRACS 400 through\n\nASMSBs TRACS 400.118.    The second avenue, according to Mr Thio, was a dial-up\n\nlink between a stand alone computer in the office of Amsteel Capital and the TRACS 400 in the back\n\noffice of Amsteel Singapore.119.    However, Mr Thios evidence on these two avenues was\n\nunsatisfactory.120.    For example, as regards the connection between the two\n\nTRACS 400 systems, he was uncertain whether ASMSBs TRACS 400 could access the TRACS 400 of\n\nAmsteel Singapore on-line real-time without any assistance from Amsteel Singapore.121.    At NE 338B to C, he said:Q Is it your position that TRACS 400 system in Plaintiffs office was\n\n  linked in any way with head office and with ASMSB?A Yes.Q Describe the link.A The link can be through dedicated hot-line or lease-line that enables\n\n  information to be downloaded from Plaintiffs to ASMSB. There were 2 lease-lines then. Or it would\n\n  be through a dial up line which the vendor had established between head office and Plaintiffs\n\n  TRACS 400.122.    At NE 342A to 344C, he said:Q Are you maintaining that there was a link via lease line between\n\n  Plaintiffs TRACS and ASMSBs TRACS?A Technically the link would be through the front end system of the Plaintiffs\n\n  which is connected to the TRACS 400 system of Plaintiffs. The Plaintiffs front end system would\n\n  be linked to ASMSBs front end system which in turn was connected to TRACS 400 system.Q You have given a different answer?A Yes I wanted to clarify.Q PW2 said that the link between the 2 front end systems was not to allow the\n\n  authorised person at Malaysian end to gain access to data but to allow Plaintiffs to put in buy or\n\n  sell orders through ASMSB. Would you like to re-consider your answer that the main purpose of the\n\n  lease line link was to allow remote access to Plaintiffs data?A What Mr Loo said is one of the purposes. I do not fully agree with him.Q Are you still maintaining that the main purpose of the lease line link was to\n\n  gain access to Plaintiffs data?A Yes.Q Suggest that is not correct otherwise the link would be between the two\n\n  backroom systems?A Disagree.Q Suggest that you have decided to add on the dial up link between Plaintiffs\n\n  office and head office only after hearing Loo Peng Hock give evidence about the PC stand alone in\n\n  head office?A Disagree.Q Is it your position that through the 2 links i.e. the lease line link and\n\n  dial up line, the person in Malaysia could get access to all data and reports in Plaintiffs\n\n  TRACS 400?A Yes.Q Was it on-line real-time?A Between the 2 front offices it was real time but not for the backroom. I wish\n\n  to change that. Head office can get the information on-line real-time.Q Refer to NE 112E and F. Is it still your position that the front end system\n\n  of Plaintiffs was linked to backroom of Plaintiffs on-line real-time?A It was linked on-line but not real-time.Q Refer to lease line link between front end system of Plaintiffs office and\n\n  front end system of ASMSB. Would you agree that whoever is at Malaysian end could not see the data\n\n  in Plaintiffs backroom system at all?A Disagree.Q If data in front end of Plaintiffs office had to be uploaded to Plaintiffs\n\n  backroom system, then anyone else linked to Plaintiffs front end would not be able to access\n\n  the data in Plaintiffs backroom system without it being specifically sent to the Plaintiffs\n\n  front-end system or uploaded into it.A No.123.    During cross-examination, Mr Thios evidence (as well as\n\nMr Loos) was on the basis that the information in the front office computer of Amsteel Singapore\n\nhad to be uploaded to its backroom computer system ie. the TRACS 400. The uploading meant that the\n\ninformation had to be manually transferred from the computer in the front office to the computer in\n\nthe back office. This must have meant that ASMSBs TRACS 400 could not have direct access to\n\ninformation in Amsteel Singapores TRACS 400 because the two systems in the respective back\n\noffices were not directly linked. Mr Thio had adamantly refused to accept this.124.    Then in re-examination, Mr Thio suddenly said that\n\nuploading was an automatic process without requiring any manual intervention (NE 452B).125.    He also explained that when he said that ASMSB could not\n\nget the information real time, he meant that the backroom of Amsteel Singapore only processed the\n\ninformation from the front room at the end of the day on a batch basis (NE 452B to D).126.    He then contradicted himself again when he said that the\n\nprocessed information of Amsteel Singapore could be seen real-time by ASMSB instantaneously\n\nbut yet ASMSB could not see the raw data that was not processed by Amsteel Singapore. He had no\n\nexplanation why this was so, see NE 452F to 453B:Q Would the processed information seen be real-time?A Yes. It would be seen instantaneously.Q Would people in Malaysian end have been able to see the raw data that was not\n\n  processed?A Probably not see the raw data that is unprocessed.Ct to DW1 Why not?DW1 (No answer).127.    I find that the position regarding the TRACS 400 systems\n\nwas as explained by Mr Loo.128.    At NE 112A to F, Mr Loo said:Q Backroom computer system of Plaintiffs and Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd\n\n  were linked via a hot line or lease line?A For Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd, it is regulated by KLSE. Neither the\n\n  front office system or the backroom system is allowed to be linked with anyone else without\n\n  approval of KLSE. There was a lease line between the front office systems of Plaintiffs and\n\n  Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd. It is not an on-line system but a proprietary or direct line.\n\n  Plaintiffs is a client of Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd. It allows Plaintiffs to open an account\n\n  with Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd in Plaintiffs own name. This allows Plaintiffs dealer to\n\n  transmit to Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd a buy or sell order. However the dealer in Plaintiffs\n\n  office cannot execute the trade because of KLSE requirements. Whatever trade is sent to Amsteel\n\n  Securities (M) Sdn Bhd is subject to approval of dealer in Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd who\n\n  would check the credit and trading limits of Plaintiffs which has a master account with Amsteel\n\n  Securities (M) Sdn Bhd.The front office system is a trading system and the backroom system is the processing system for\n\n  settlement.The data from the front office is not automatically transmitted to the backroom.It has to be up-loaded to the backroom system. This is for Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn Bhd and\n\n  applies to Plaintiffs too.129.    As for the second avenue through which Amsteel Capital was\n\nallegedly supposed to have been able to access information from Amsteel Singapores TRACS 400\n\nsystem through the stand alone computer in Amsteel Capitals office, this was not alluded to by Mr\n\nThio in his AEIC or by his counsel Mr Quek Mong Hua during cross-examination of the witnesses for\n\nAmsteel Singapore.130.    I find that this allegation was an afterthought by Mr Thio\n\nafter he had learned in the course of the trial about the stand alone computer in Amsteel Capitals\n\noffice that was linked to the TRACS 400 in Amsteel Singapores office.131.    I also find that this link was, as Mr Loo explained it, to\n\nenable the vendor of the TRACS 400 to develop and enhance the software for Amsteel Singapore by\n\ndoing the work in Malaysia.132.    At NE 113D to 114C, Mr Loo said:Q Refer to AEIC para 21, 1stsentence, \"Although technically\n\n   was frequently down\". I read this to mean that the computer at Amsteel Securities (M) Sdn\n\n  Bhd could access to Plaintiffs system but in reality the link was frequently down.A The TRACS 400 system in Plaintiffs office was frequently down and needs a\n\n  lot of customisation before change to ITSS or to suit Plaintiffs trading environment. Vendor of\n\n  Plaintiffs office system was asked to travel to Singapore from Malaysia to resolve the\n\n  technical problems. Vendor suggested that time a PC stand alone from Plaintiffs office with a\n\n  menu of the TRACS system be loaded on the stand alone PC so that they can work from Malaysia on\n\n  the customisation exercise. The PC had a dial up connection with Plaintiffs office. The\n\n  intention was that once the customisation had been completed, the customised programme can be\n\n  downloaded into a diskette and sent to Plaintiffs office. However the dial up connection was\n\n  frequently down. This is what I am trying to describe in my para 21.Q Where was the PC stand alone put?A At Amsteel Capitals office, 2ndfloor. AIT (M) Sdn Bhd was the\n\n  vendor of the TRACS 400 system to Plaintiffs. The PC stand alone was in Amsteel Capitals office\n\n  because of confidentiality reasons. Vendor can see the data but not outsiders.Q What kind of data was confidential?A The data in Plaintiffs computer system.133.    In re-examination (at NE 253E to 254B), Mr Loo said that\n\nthe stand alone computer was not to allow the vendor, or anyone else to see the data in Amsteel\n\nSingapores TRACS 400. It was,  for development and enhancing the software so the vendor\n\nworking on the software can see the menu. Thats what I meant. I accept Mr Loos evidence on\n\nthis point.",
        "Reports": "134.    Mr Thio also took the position that Amsteel Singapore had\n\nsent GP various reports from which GP knew the details of the trades by the clients of Amsteel\n\nSingapore and never objected.135.    These reports were:(a) Daily profit and loss (PSB 272 and 282)(b) Daily Business Done (P&S) (Exhibit D1)(c) Daily Business Done Summary (Purchases) (Exhibit D2A)(d) Daily Business Done Summary (Sales) (Exhibit D2B)(e) Weekly Schedule of Anticipated Funding Requirements (eg. AB 470 and 471)(f) Weekly Analysis of Remisiers & Dealers outstanding positions (eg.\n\n  AB 392)(g) Weekly outstanding sales contracts or purchases contracts (not produced).(h) Weekly or Fortnightly outstanding contra loss report & steps taken (PSB\n\n  36, NE 346E). This was supposedly sent regularly after 5 November 1997 although it was sent on an\n\n  ad hoc basis prior to that (NE 346B, E, 379E/F).(i) Monthly Financial Highlights including profit & loss and balance sheet\n\n  (eg. PSB 358 to 378)(j) Minutes of management meetings sent monthly (NE 346D).136.    GP accepted that he had received the daily profit and loss\n\nreport. Of the other reports, only the Daily Business Done (P&S) report contained the details of\n\nthe names of those clients who had transacted each day. As the rest of the reports do not contain\n\nsuch details, I need not consider them any further for the time being.137.    Each of the Daily Business Done (P&S) reports (which\n\nis a computer print-out) ran into several pages. For example, Exhibit D1 had twelve pages. Mr Thio\n\nsaid that this was sent by fax daily by Amsteel Singapore to Amsteel Capital but he did not have\n\npersonal knowledge of this (NE 347B/C).138.    Also, he could not explain why, if Amsteel Capital had\n\ndirect access to the information in Amsteel Singapores TRACS 400, there was a need for Amsteel\n\nSingapore to fax this document daily.139.    Mr Thio made two statements (at PB 8 to 9 and 10 to 13) to\n\nMs Tan during her investigation.140.    In PB 8, he said in the first paragraph, \n\nFurthermore, on a daily basis, our Accounts Department will fax to Amsteel Singapore the Profit\n\n& Loss - Business Done Report.141.    During cross-examination on Friday 22 September 2000, he\n\naccepted (at NE 371C) that that statement referred to a different document ie. the daily reports on\n\nthe profit and loss of Amsteel Singapore, an example of which is found at PSB 272. Another example\n\nis at PSB 282.142.    However on Monday 25 September 2000, also during\n\ncross-examination, he said (at NE 377D to 378B) that the statement in PB 8 referred to both types of\n\ndaily reports meaning:(a) the Daily Business Done (P&S) report which has details of the\n\n  transactions done for each day and the names of the clients (see Exhibit D1), and(b) the daily report on the profit and loss of Amsteel Singapore (see PSB 272\n\n  and 282) which does not have such details but has details of the gross and net commission of\n\n  Amsteel Singapore.143.    When this inconsistency was brought to Mr Thios\n\nattention, Mr Thio said he did mention that the daily report on the profit and loss was not the only\n\nreport, he was distracted and he was not given the chance to elaborate (NE 378C).144.    I do not accept Mr Thios explanation that he was\n\ndistracted or not given the chance to elaborate. As suggested by Mr Yeo, I find that Mr Thio had\n\nreflected on his earlier answer over the week-end and decided to change his evidence on this point.145.    I also note that Mr Thios AEIC does not mention the\n\nDaily Business Done (P&S) report.146.    GP said he had never seen the Daily Business Done\n\n(P&S) report although he did see the daily report on the profit and loss of Amsteel Singapore. I\n\naccept GPs evidence on this point. It would have been a case of overloading GP with too much\n\ninformation if the Daily Business Done (P&S) report had been sent to him daily.147.    Mr Quek argued that if ASMSB had no direct link with\n\nAmsteel Singapores TRACS 400 system then there was all the more reason for the Daily Business\n\nDone (P&S) report to have been sent daily to GP.148.    I do not agree that the latter follows from the former. It\n\nall depends on what GP wanted to receive and he did not want to receive such detailed information.149.    I find that Mr Thio has failed to establish that the Daily\n\nBusiness Done (P&S) report was faxed daily by Amsteel Singapore to Amsteel Capital.150.    It seems to me that Mr Thios insistence that Amsteel\n\nCapital was aware of the details of every clients transactions done through Amsteel Singapore\n\nstems from two factors.151.    First, there was a system of supervision by Amsteel\n\nCapital with officers there which had a regional title similar to that of officers in Amsteel\n\nSingapore. For example, there was a Regional Operations Manager in Amsteel Capital to supervise the\n\nOperations Manager of Amsteel Singapore and presumably of the other regional offices as well. Mr\n\nThio believed that the existence of the system of supervision as well as a built in reporting system\n\nfrom a daily to a weekly basis meant that Amsteel Capital knew the details of the transactions of\n\nevery client of Amsteel Singapore.152.    In my view, Mr Thio had erred. Just because there was a\n\nsystem of supervision (or overseeing as Mr Thio called it) and some reports were regularly\n\nsent to Amsteel Capital did not mean that Amsteel Capital had detailed information of every clients\n\ntransactions at all times.153.    The second factor that Mr Thio relied on was that Amsteel\n\nCapital had queried Amsteel Singapore about some outstanding contra losses of the clients of Amsteel\n\nSingapore. Mr Thio reasoned that Amsteel Capital was able to do so only because it had obtained\n\ndirect information about the same from its own means.154.    This is where Mr Thio had erred again. It must not be\n\nforgotten that Amsteel Singapore did send reports on contra losses to Amsteel Capital. This was\n\nprobably the source of the query or queries of Amsteel Capital and not because Amsteel Capital had\n\ndetailed information of every clients transactions irrespective of whether the client made a\n\nprofit or loss.",
        "What GP knew and what he did or did not do": "155.    However, that is not all. Even though Mr Thio had not kept\n\nGP informed, either orally or in writing, of each and every one of the events which were supposed to\n\nbe disclosed to GP (see para 73 above), this was not deliberate as Amsteel Singapore was suggesting.\n\nFurthermore, it was incumbent on Amsteel Singapore to prove exactly what was not disclosed and that\n\nGP would have taken some step which would have averted the losses had GP been kept informed.156.    GP said that he had been kept in the dark about the\n\ntrading limits and huge transactions but I do not accept his evidence on this point. As I have said,\n\nhe was kept informed, but not of each and every event.157.    Furthermore, GP stopped short of actually asserting that\n\nhad he known all the details, he would have taken some step or steps which would have averted the\n\nlosses. Neither did he assert what that step or those steps would have been.158.    In Plaintiffs Skeletal Reply Submissions, para 20, it\n\nis submitted that Mr Thios failure to keep GP advised deprived him of an opportunity to keep Mr\n\nThios actions in check. During oral submissions, Mr Yeo argued that I should draw an inference\n\nthat GP would have taken some step which would have averted the losses.159.    I do not agree that I should draw such an inference.160.    In the absence of the assertions that GP should have made,\n\nAmsteel Singapores contention that Mr Thios failure to comply with the LAC had caused its\n\nlosses did not have a leg to stand on.161.    Besides, I am of the view that GP knew enough to\n\nintervene, had he really wanted to do so.162.    Firstly, it will be re-called that in addition to Mr Thios\n\noral information to him, GP had received the daily profit and loss reports of Amsteel Singapore,\n\nalthough he did not receive the Daily Business Done (P&S) report (see para 146 above). The daily\n\nreports he received disclosed the gross and net commission of Amsteel Singapore and gave a breakdown\n\nof commission earned by its dealers. From these reports, it was clear that:(a) Amsteel Singapores turnover, ie. trades done by its clients, was huge\n\n  especially bearing in mind its relatively small capital base of S$5m. As at end October 1997,\n\n  gross commission was just under S$3.7m which meant that its turnover (for slightly over three\n\n  months) was slightly under $370m (on a gross commission of 1%. If the commission was less for\n\n  trades over certain amounts, the turnover would have been even higher).(b) Most of the turnover came from the clients of Mr Lye who would be\n\n  responsible for up to around 98% of the turnover (see the profit & loss report as at 10\n\n  October 1997 at PSB 282).163.    On the 80/20 principle, GP must have known that a large\n\nportion of Amsteel Singapores revenue was generated from a small portion of its clients. When\n\nthis principle was mentioned to him (at NE 177B/C) he did not dispute the principle.164.    Thirdly, I also asked GP some questions.165.    At NE 190B to D:Ct to PW1 Refer to PSB 282. Did it not occur to you that since most of the\n\n  revenue comes from one dealer, it was likely that most of his business came from a small group of\n\n  clients?PW1 I did not do a review of it personally. This report is shared between\n\n  myself, Choong and Loo Peng Hock. When I made comments like that they would know how to get back\n\n  down to CEO.Ct to PW1 Were you not interested to know the spread of this dealer Anthony\n\n  Lye?PW1 Sure I was but I never got down to review his clientele.166.    Fourthly, a monthly progress report dated 1 October 1997\n\nsubmitted by Mr Thio to GP identified the top five clients for August and September 1997 in terms of\n\nrevenue generated (AB 524). Although there was some dispute as to when GP received this report, he\n\naccepted that he would have seen it in October 1997 (NE 56E/F).167.    From this report, three of the top five clients for August\n\n1997 were individuals:Aug-97Client(000)%Wako Merchant Bank590.349.93%Wong Lai Leong60.95.15%Nyala Kancil (M) Sdn Bhd54.64.62%Alegesan A/L Thangiah47.64.03%Sambasivam A/L Ramanujam46.43.92%________________________________799.967.64%________________________________Total revenue generated1,182.35168.    For September 1997, three other individuals were among the\n\ntop five:Sep-97Client(000)%Wako Merchant Bank154.811.62%Nyala Kancil (M)103.37.76%Tan Chee Meng88.26.62%Choi Mei Choo72.15.41%Wong Lai Leong54.74.11%________________________________473.135.52%________________________________Total revenue generated1331.91169.    Although the transactions of the individuals who were\n\namong the top five clients for August 1997 and September 1997 are not the subject of Amsteel\n\nSingapores claims, the point is that GP did not seek any information about them when he received\n\nthe report.170.    GPs reason for not making any inquiry was that he\n\nnoticed from the figures for September 1997 that the share of the top five clients had come down\n\nfrom 67% to 35% and the contribution from individual clients had also come down.171.    I am of the view that these are not valid reasons. Whether\n\nthe percentage amount of revenue contributed by the top five clients had come down or not, the point\n\nwas whether he was concerned enough about the individual clients who were engaged in huge trading\n\nvolumes to ask about them. Secondly, the contribution from individual clients, among the top five\n\nclients, had not come down but had in fact gone up in September 1997 from 13.1% to 16.14%.172.    GP must also have known that many of the trades were on\n\nspeculative counters as such counters would generate high volumes regularly and also from contra\n\nloss reports (AB 519 to 522).173.    Yet GP did not at that time seek to curb the activities of\n\nAmsteel Singapore or demand for more information about the various individuals who were clients.174.    I am aware that on one of the daily reports as at 10\n\nOctober 1997 (PSB 282), GP wrote the following comments:Revenue generation must be broader based. Too dangerous dependent on Anthony\n\n  Lye.175.    Mr Quek submitted that this comment reflected GPs\n\nconcern from the point of generating revenue and not risk management. I agree.176.    I also refer to GPs handwritten comments on the e-mail\n\ndated 18 November 1997 from Anita Chong to him. The comments have been set out in para 99 above.177.    This was the first time that GP had asked for the\n\nfinancial background of those clients with a trading limit of more than $500,000 (it was not clear\n\nwhether he meant in S$ or RM), but still there was no sense of urgency or alarm in his comment.\n\nIndeed, there is no evidence of his having chased Lim Yew Meng or Mr Loo for the information or that\n\neither of these two persons had acted upon his instructions immediately.178.    The truth of the matter was that GP knew what was\n\nhappening (even though he did not know every detail) and chose not to curtail the activities of\n\nAmsteel Singapore.179.    Accordingly, although there were lapses on Mr Thios\n\npart regarding compliance with the LAC, Amsteel Singapore has failed to establish that the lapses\n\nprevented GP from averting the losses.180.    In so far as Mr Yeo has argued that the trades allowed by\n\nMr Thio far exceeded the paid-up capital of Amsteel Singapore, this argument is neither here nor\n\nthere.181.    Besides, I am of the view that GP was aware that the\n\ntrades exceeded the paid-up capital of Amsteel Singapore because he knew the commission that was\n\nbeing generated and hence the turnover. In addition, the Weekly Schedule of Anticipated Funding\n\nRequirements, which was sent regularly to Amsteel Capital (see para 135 (e) above) would have also\n\nalerted GP that the turnover of Amsteel Singapore far exceeded its paid-up capital. That is why from\n\ntime to time, the group had to assist Amsteel Singapore with its funding requirements.",
        "INSTRUCTIONS ON 7 NOVEMBER 1997 ABOUT MCL, INNOVEST AND HOTLINE": "215.    There are other unsatisfactory aspects about the evidence\n\nof GP and of Mr Loo regarding the 7 November 1997 meeting.216.    GP had alleged in para 46 of his AEIC that he recalled\n\nhaving informed Mr Thio at that meeting that no further trades on MCL Corporation Berhad (MCL)\n\nwere to take place as ASMSB already had outstanding exposure to this counter. He also alleged that\n\nhe had told Mr Thio to wind down on two other counters ie. Hotline Furniture Berhad (Hotline)\n\nand Innovest Berhad (Innovest). In para 47 of his AEIC, he alleged that Mr Thio had ignored\n\nhis instructions and continued to trade in MCL, Hotline and Innovest which were the counters which\n\nultimately caused substantial losses to Amsteel Singapore.217.    Mr Loo also said that GP had advised Mr Thio at the 7\n\nNovember 1997 meeting not to be involved in and to wind down on speculative counters. They included\n\nMCL and Innovest (Mr Loos AEIC paras 94 and 99 and NE 147E to 148A and 213D to F).218.    However the alleged instruction about MCL, Innovest and\n\nHotline is not even found in the written NTP.219.    Furthermore, the evidence showed that as at 7 November\n\n1997, Amsteel Singapore had no exposure on Hotline or Innovest (NE 105D).220.    Quite clearly the allegation about winding down on Hotline\n\nand on Innovest had been fabricated.221.    As for MCL, I note that Ms Tans report also did not\n\nmention the existence of GPs alleged oral instruction to stop further trades on MCL or that Mr\n\nThio had ignored it or that she had investigated this allegation. If the allegation were true, both\n\nGP and Mr Loo would have ensured that this point was investigated bearing in mind that GP had\n\nbriefed Ms Tan on her investigation and Mr Loo was a member of the committee.222.    I find that the allegation about GP having told Mr Thio\n\nnot to allow further trades in MCL was also fabricated.223.    The evidence of GP regarding MCL, Hotline and Innovest,\n\nand Mr Loo regarding MCL and Innovest was fabricated because, as GP himself put it (in his AEIC at\n\npara 47), these were the counters which ultimately caused substantial losses to the Plaintiffs,\n\neven though they were not the only counters which caused substantial losses.",
        "CHECKS": "224.    One of the main allegations against Mr Thio was that he\n\nhad failed to exercise due diligence and care in that he had granted high trading limits without\n\nconducting any check or adequate checks on the clients.225.    The impression given by Ms Tans report and the thrust\n\nof the claim was that Mr Thio was a loose cannon who gave high trading limits too easily.226.    However the evidence from Mr Thio at trial showed a\n\ndifferent picture. At NE 351D to 352B, he explained the steps he would take before approving a\n\ntrading limit of more than RM2m:(a) Personally meet the client together with the dealer to have an independent\n\n  assessment.(b) Ask Credit Administrator Anita Chong to do a check on the clients\n\n  background, specifically the companies that he claimed to own or be a director of and any adverse\n\n  litigation against him.(c) Usually confer with at least two of the managers in the Credit Committee to\n\n  seek their inputs on the reputation of the client.(d) Ask Research Manager whether he was aware of any useful information about\n\n  the client and his companies.(e) Sometimes look at prospectus and/or annual reports to verify.(f) Ask Amsteel Singapores Operations Manager who had ten years experience\n\n  to check around with his contacts in other stockbroking houses.(g) Ask Amsteel Singapores Finance & Admin Manager to seek feedback from\n\n  his contacts with bankers.(h) Find out from the client some information pertaining to his trading\n\n  experience, his net worth and who his brokers and bankers were as well as his plans for growth,\n\n  restructuring and acquisition.(i) Discreetly contact at least one of the brokers that the client has\n\n  mentioned he had used before, if any.227.    While Mr Yeo questioned the checks which Anita Chong was\n\nsupposed to have been tasked to do, he did not challenge the rest of the steps which Mr Thio said he\n\ngenerally took.228.    In addition, the account opening forms for each of the\n\nindividuals in the first three groups of clients were also reviewed by an officer of Amsteel\n\nSingapore who put his/her signature to the form beside Mr Thios signature of approval. In other\n\nwords, the documentary evidence suggested that Mr Thio did not approve the trading limits\n\nsingle-handedly.229.    Furthermore, when an upward revision of trading limit was\n\nallowed, a member of the Credit Committee and Mr Thio would sign on the relevant document to\n\napprove. So again Mr Thio did not approve the increase single-handedly.230.    Mr Yeo was left to argue that Mr Thio should have obtained\n\ndocumentary evidence of the worth of the clients especially those who were given high trading\n\nlimits.231.    To this extent, Mr Yeos position was supported by the\n\nreport and the evidence of Ms Tan. To Ms Tan, there was inadequate check by Mr Thio because she did\n\nnot see any documentary evidence of his checks.232.    The question is whether Mr Thio was negligent in failing\n\nto obtain documentary evidence of the worth of clients who were considered HNWIs.233.    To an accountant like Ms Tan, such documentary evidence\n\nshould have been obtained. However I have to consider the position of a stockbroker.234.    Mr Yeo sought to bolster his point by arguing that\n\nstockbrokers were financing their clients and therefore were like bankers. Just as bankers sought\n\ndocumentary evidence of the income or worth of a client, he argued that Mr Thio should also have\n\nsought such documentary evidence.235.    However, I am of the view that stockbrokers are not\n\nbankers and their practices are not the same. Indeed I note that none of the witnesses for Amsteel\n\nSingapore suggested that stockbrokers should carry on business in the same way as bankers did or do.236.    It is true that the minutes of a Credit Committee Meeting\n\nof Amsteel Singapore on 3 or 5 October 1997 (AB 528 and 529) mentioned the requirement to obtain\n\ndocumentary proof of earnings and net worth for limits for individuals above S$750,000.237.    However, that was the general requirement. Whether it\n\nshould have been implemented with respect to a particular client depended on the particular facts.238.    I am reinforced in this view by the fact that ASMSB also\n\nhad a similar general requirement to obtain documentary proof of income (see AB 337). Yet, the\n\nevidence regarding ASMSB showed that it too did not invariably obtain documentary evidence from all\n\nits individual clients who were granted high trading limits.239.    For example, from the top five debtors or groups of\n\ndebtors of ASMSB, there were three common clients with Amsteel Singapore:(a) Chew Kar Hooi,(b) Lim Tee Keong,(c) Sim Joo Hock240.    Below is a table showing the trading limits granted to\n\neach of these three individuals by Amsteel Singapore and by ASMSB:Amsteel SingaporeASMSB1. Chew Kar HooiRM20 millionRM20 million for ordinary accountRM20 million for margin account2. Lim Tee KeongRM20 millionRM20 million for ordinary accountRM30 million for margin account3. Sim Joo HockRM10 millionRM6 million241.    ASMSB also did not obtain documentary evidence of the\n\nincome or net worth of these three clients.242.    As another illustration, one of the top five debtors of\n\nASMSB was one Kam Hock Aun, a designer with Couture Colleczion. ASMSB had granted him a trading\n\nlimit of RM20m without obtaining documentary evidence of his or her income or net worth (PSB 992 to\n\n993).243.    I would again refer to the handwritten comments of GP when\n\nhe received Anita Chongs e-mail dated 18 November 1997. I have set out these comments in para 99\n\nabove. I note that contrary to the assertion in PCS para 28, GP did not seek documentary evidence\n\nabout the clients net worth when he received the list of clients with trading limits of RM2m and\n\nabove. All he stated was that he needed to know their financial background.244.    I am of the view that while it would be ideal to have\n\ndocumentary evidence of income and net worth from the point of view of risk management, the reality\n\nis that a stockbroker does not always seek documentary evidence from an HNWI whose business he is\n\ntrying to cultivate. To do so might even kill the business opportunity, especially if he seeks such\n\nevidence while other stockbrokers do not.245.    Whether Mr Thio was negligent in allowing high trading\n\nlimits for the clients concerned or clients to exceed their trading limits or in allowing them to\n\nbuy certain counters must depend on the particular facts.",
        "THE DATO JERRY GOH GROUP": "246.    The names of the clients of this group, as classified by\n\nAmsteel Singapore for the trial, and other details are set out below:Name of debtorOccupationDate Account OpenedTrading Limit (RM / S$)(million)CollateralLee Kok KeongDirector, Esprit Melaka City Sdn Bhd19.9.97(PSB 153 & 154)RM10/ S$5.05(PSB 153, 154)Letter of Guarantee from Dato Jerry Goh.Cash collateral of RM1,551,800.15 (from Dato Jerry Goh).Lee LaiManager, Esprit Corporation Sdn Bhd19.9.97(PSB 144 & 145)RM10/ S$5.05(PSB 144 & 145)Letter of Guarantee from Dato Jerry Goh.Same cash collateral of RM1,551,800.15 (from Dato Jerry Goh).Lok Joo HeanGeneral Manager, Corporate Manager, Esprit Group Bhd19.9.97(PSB 163/ AB 748)RM10/ S$5.05(PSB 163/ AB 748)Letter of Guarantee from Dato Jerry Goh.Chew Kar HooiCEO, Goodnite Holdings Bhd10.10.97(PSB 134 & 135)RM20/ S$9(PSB 134 & 135)Lim Tee Keong(Dato)Director, Genting Bhd10.10.97(PSB 125 & 126)RM20/ S$9(PSB 125 & 126)Sum of RM206,395.80 in Lim Tee Keongs trust account.Cash collateral of RM1 million247.    Mr Yeo argued that all these five were trading as a group\n\nand that as a group the aggregate trading limit of RM70m was too high.248.    Mr Yeos reasons for classifying these five individuals\n\nas a group were:(a) By early November 1997, four of the individuals had each given a power of\n\n  attorney to Chew Kar Hooi to operate their respective accounts.(b) There was a letter of authorisation signed by all the five individuals to\n\n  Amsteel Singapore to authorise it to set-off money in any of their accounts to pay losses incurred\n\n  in any of the other accounts.(c) These individuals were trading in the same counters and in some cases, the\n\n  shares were rolled over indirectly between themselves.249.    Mr Thio disagreed that Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee\n\nKeong were trading as part of the group for the following reasons:(a) Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong had opened their accounts later on 10\n\n  October 1997 whereas the first three had opened theirs on 19 September 1997.(b) Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong were assessed on their own merit and\n\n  had a higher standing than the first three.(c) The guarantee from Dato Jerry Goh was only in respect of the first three\n\n  individuals.(d) A collateral of RM1,551,800.15 was demarcated as being for the Dato Jerry\n\n  Goh group and a separate RM1m for Dato Lim Tee Keong.250.    Mr Thio said that the power of attorney was to formalise\n\nthe confirmation of orders through a single individual. However the written confirmation of any\n\ntrade for any account was sent to the respective individual and that Amsteel Singapore had always\n\ntreated the five as having separate accounts with separate orders. However, if this was a valid\n\npoint, then even the first three individuals would not be considered as part of the group and yet Mr\n\nThio admitted that these three were part of the group.251.    As for the letter of authorisation, Mr Thio said that the\n\nright of set-off afforded Amsteel Singapore more protection. He refused to accept that that letter\n\nindicated that the five were trading as a group.252.    I am of the view that while the letter of authorisation\n\nafforded Amsteel Singapore more protection against losses, it was nevertheless an indication that\n\nthe five were trading as a group.253.    In addition, Mr Thio had given two written statements to\n\nMs Tan in the course of her investigation. PB 8 and 9 was a statement he had himself prepared (NE\n\n414C). PB 10 to 13 was a statement which he did not prepare but he had signed. That statement was\n\ntaken from him on 23 December 1997 and he signed it on 24 December 1997.254.    At PB 8, there was a heading Lim Tee Keong, Jerry Goh\n\n& Chew Kar Hooi Group. Beneath that Mr Thio said, This group of accounts have been in\n\noperation since October 1997 .. It is true that the first three clients accounts were\n\nactually opened earlier but the point is that Mr Thio himself was treating these three clients and\n\nthe other two ie. Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong as one group. Similarly the heading in the\n\nstatement at PB 10 and the substance thereof indicated that he was treating all five as one group\n\nalthough in PB 11 there is the following sentence Lim Tee Keong case was treated separately &\n\nhis account was approved based on the fact that he is the son of Mr Lim Goh Tong.255.    Mr Lye also said that these five individuals were trading\n\nas a group. On the other hand, Mr Quek argued that Mr Lye also said that these five were treated by\n\nAmsteel Singapore as a group for administrative convenience. In my view this did not mean that they\n\nwere not trading as a group.256.    For the reasons advanced by Mr Yeo and in the light of Mr\n\nThios statements to Ms Tan and Mr Lyes evidence, I find that these five individuals were\n\ntrading as a group.257.    However this does not necessarily mean that the trading\n\nlimit for this group had to be restricted to RM30m (being the original limit for a group).258.    It must be remembered that the trading limit for a group\n\nwas the general rule but exceptions could be made. The real question is whether Mr Thio was\n\nnegligent in granting the trading limits to these five individuals when considered on an individual\n\nbasis as well as on a group basis.259.    The Dato Jerry Goh group was recommended by two persons,\n\nnamely, Marc and Shirley from the Hong Leong Group (HLG) in Malaysia to Mr Lye.260.    Lee Kok Keong was a director of Esprit Melaka City Sdn\n\nBhd.261.    Lee Lai was a manager of Esprit Corporation Sdn Bhd.262.    Lok Joo Hean was a general manager of Esprit Group Bhd.263.    These three were close friends of Dato Jerry Goh and Dato\n\nLim Tee Keong, both of whom had highly recommended them. Dato Lim Tee Keong also subsequently became\n\na client of Amsteel Singapore. He is the fifth member of this group.264.    Dato Jerry Goh was a director and major shareholder of OConnors\n\nSdn Bhd and Esprit Sdn Bhd. Also, Mr Lye said that at that time, Dato Jerry Goh had a pretty good\n\nreputation in the market. Lee Kok Keong and Jerry Goh always paid their losses (NE 264D).265.    Dato Lim Tee Keong was a director of Genting Berhad,\n\nHartford Group and Focal Portfolio Sdn Bhd. He was also the Chairman of Hua Tai Industries Bhd which\n\nwas listed on the KLSE and the son of Tan Sri Lim Goh Tong, whom Mr Thio described as the owner of\n\nGenting Berhad.266.    Chew Kar Hooi was a director of Good Nite Holdings Bhd,\n\nwhich was also listed on the KLSE. He had an account with three other Malaysian stockbrokers, ie.\n\nASMSB, HLG and TA Securities.267.    Mr Thio said that for Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee\n\nKeong, most major brokers and private brokers would fight to get their business (NE 420A).268.    Indeed, as the table in para 240 shows, Chew Kar Hooi and\n\nDato Lim Tee Keong were also clients of ASMSB. Each of them had been granted a trading limit by\n\nASMSB of RM20m for his ordinary account and another RM20m or RM30m for his margin trading account.269.    Furthermore, ironically, Mr Yeo informed me that ASMSB had\n\ntreated these two individuals separately and not as a group even though each of them had given a\n\nguarantee to ASMSB to secure the others account. In my view, this reinforces Mr Thios point,\n\nwhich I accept, that each of these two persons could be assessed separately for the trading limit to\n\nbe granted to each.270.    I would add that Mr Thio said that he did make inquiries\n\nof ASMSB regarding the Dato Jerry Goh group but claimed that ASMSB was not willing to share much\n\ninformation with him.271.    As for security, I am aware that in a 5 November 1997\n\nmanagement meeting of Amsteel Singapore (Mr Loos AEIC p 755) a decision was made for new and\n\nexisting accounts with trading positions over RM1m, in general, to be secured with collateral of 10%\n\nfor cash and 20% for shares.272.    However, as stated in the minutes, that was the general\n\nrule and again exceptions could be made.273.    According to Mr Lye, collateral of 10% for cash or 20% for\n\nshares was indeed requested but instead a guarantee from Dato Jerry Goh was provided (Mr Lyes\n\nAEIC para 19).274.    However, as can be seen from the table in para 246 above,\n\ncash collateral must have been provided subsequently, even though it was not up to 10% of the\n\ntrading limits.275.    The counters which are the subject of this groups\n\nlosses are Esprit Group Berhad and MCL.276.    The first three individuals were senior officers in\n\ncompanies in the Esprit group. Dato Jerry Goh who provided a guarantee for their accounts was a\n\ndirector and major shareholder of Esprit Sdn Bhd. These factors must have comforted Mr Thio when the\n\ngroup traded in Esprit shares.277.    As for MCL, Mr Yeo pointed out that the exposure of\n\nAmsteel Singapore to MCL was twice the paid-up capital of MCL. He argued that Mr Thio should have\n\nlooked into MCL more carefully before allowing substantial purchases of MCL shares.278.    In my view, the paid-up capital of MCL is not relevant.279.    Furthermore, ASMSB had also allowed clients like Chew Kar\n\nHooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong to make substantial purchases of MCL shares (NE 204B and 206B to E).280.    There is one other point made by Mr Yeo in respect of this\n\ngroup.281.    Mr Yeo referred to para 22 of Mr Lyes AEIC, regarding\n\nthis groups exposure to MCL shares. It states:22. Sometime around early November 1997, I had considered winding down the\n\n  MCL position. This was because by that time, the Plaintiffs exposure to the MCL counter was\n\n  already very significant, and that particular counter was already trading at very high prices.\n\n  However, the clients, upon learning of my intentions, approached the Defendant and appealed to\n\n  him. The Defendant acceded to the clients requests and allowed them to continue to roll the\n\n  deals. Significantly, when the final tranches of 894,000 MCL shares were rolled into the\n\n  Plaintiffs between 14 - 19 November 1997, they were at a price of close to RM41 million. As the\n\n  clients did not settle those outstanding shares, the Plaintiffs had to force sell them thereby\n\n  incurring huge contra losses, which the clients were unable to pay for either.282.    Mr Lye was not challenged on this evidence and Mr Yeo\n\nargued that this paragraph amplified Mr Thios lack of prudence (PCS para 130).283.    However, Mr Lyes evidence does not mean that Mr Thio\n\nwas necessarily negligent and indeed Mr Lye did not say that Mr Thio was negligent. Also, none of\n\nthe other witnesses for Amsteel Singapore said that Mr Thio was negligent in making this decision .284.    Mr Thio was entitled to consider the pleas of this group\n\nand to exercise his judgment in the face of a weak market. Also, these clients had in the past been\n\npaying their losses, as Mr Lye himself had said (NE 273C).285.    Mr Yeo argued that in view of the weak stock market, Mr\n\nThio should have taken tougher action against clients generally and in particular this group. This\n\nbrings to mind the saying that when it is raining, creditors withdraw the umbrella.286.    Mr Thio had to decide how much support to give these\n\nclients in the prevailing circumstances. If he had insisted that they liquidate their positions,\n\nlosses would have been likely and the situation would have been aggravated. If events had turned out\n\nfor the better, the clients would have been able to get out at more favourable prices which would\n\ncorrespondingly benefit Amsteel Singapore. In addition, the clients would have been grateful for the\n\nsupport given.287.    Furthermore, Mr Thio did not just accede to this groups\n\nrequest. He was, in the meantime, trying to obtain more security as is evidenced by his letter dated\n\n18 November 1997 to Chew Kar Hooi (DSB 37). It states:18 November 1997Mr Chew Kar HooiBy FaxFocal Portfolio Sdn BhdBy A.R.

The evidence of Mr Lye was that all of these individuals traded as a group\n\nalthough he did also say that they were treated as a group for administrative convenience.293.    I also note that Lim Lean Heng had given a guarantee or\n\nguarantees to secure the accounts of all these five clients although the guarantee for Loh Kee Lin\n\nwas given later. Mr Thio said it was given not so much to secure Loh Kee Lins account but because\n\nLoh Kee Lin had given a power of attorney to Lim Lean Heng. In my view, this explanation reinforced\n\nthe argument that Loh Kee Lin was part of the Tai Kar group.294.    I am of the view that Loh Kee Lin was trading as part of\n\nthe Tai Kar group. Whether Mr Thio was entitled to assess him separately for his trading limit is\n\nanother matter.295.    The Tai Kar group were introduced by Wako Merchant Bank\n\nSingapore to Mr Lye when he was with Ong & Company. Wako Merchant Bank functioned as a bank for\n\nHNWIs.296.    When Mr Lye joined Amsteel Singapore, he introduced these\n\nclients to Mr Thio.297.    Choi Mei Choo, Wong Lai Leong and Loh Seong Aun were\n\ndirectors of Hai Ming Management Sdn Bhd, a company listed on the KLSE.298.    These three individuals were also known to be business\n\nassociates of Lim Lean Heng who controlled five to eight listed companies in Malaysia and was\n\nsupposed to own a huge amount of land and hotels (NE 269). He was also a valued customer of many\n\nstockbrokers like Hwang DBS (in Malaysia) and HLG (see Mr Thios AEIC para 104).299.    Hor Sai was a director of EMC Logistics Berhad, another\n\ncompany listed on the KLSE.300.    According to Mr Thio, he had learned from inquiries made\n\nthat these four individuals were valued clients of many stockbroking firms (see his AEIC para 102).301.    However, Mr Thio said that the fifth individual, Loh Kee\n\nLin, had his own standing. He was the founder and a director of LKT Industries Berhad (LKT) in\n\nPenang who were and apparently still are the number one electronic parts producer in Malaysia (NE\n\n269D) which was also listed on the KLSE (Mr Thios AEIC para 105). Mr Lye agreed that Loh Kee Lin\n\nwas treated separately for credit rating purposes (NE 237C).302.    I find that Mr Thio had valid reason to consider Loh Kee\n\nLin separately for the purpose of determining his trading limit even though Loh Kee Lin was trading\n\nas part of the Tai Kar group.303.    The fact that Loh Kee Lin was the founder and a director\n\nof LKT must also have comforted Mr Thio when the group was trading in LKT and LKT A shares (the\n\nlatter being bonus shares), although as it turned out, this was the main counter giving rise to the\n\nlosses of this group.304.    In addition to Lim Lean Hengs guarantee, there was also\n\nsome collateral as mentioned in the table in para 289 above.305.    There is some dispute as to whether the share collateral\n\nwas 780,000 LKT shares in addition to 780,000 LKT A shares issued as a bonus issue or whether the\n\nshare collateral was in fact the 780,000 LKT A shares only.306.    Mr Yeo argued that it was the latter and these shares were\n\nnot available as collateral until 6 October 1997 when the bonus shares were issued.307.    The pledge document at DB 79 to 81 refers to 780,000 LKT\n\nshares and not LKT A shares. However there is no other evidence, beyond Mr Thios assertion, that\n\nLKT shares were in fact deposited with Amsteel Singapore as collateral.308.    According to Mr Yeo, a TRACS printout of Amsteel Singapore\n\ndated 7 October 1997 showed that 780,000 LKT A shares were deposited into three accounts of this\n\ngroup (PCS para 297) but the printout was not identified by reference to any of the documents before\n\nme309.    Even if I were not to accept evidence about the TRACS\n\nprintout, I am of the view that the collateral was 780,000 LKT A shares and there was no additional\n\n780,000 LKT shares.310.    Of the 780,000 LKT A shares, 750,000 were sold on 7\n\nOctober 1997.311.    Mr Yeo also argued that the trading limits of three of the\n\nindividuals in this group were revised upwards twice in a span of about two months from the time\n\nthey opened their accounts. However, this is neither here nor there. There is nothing wrong with\n\nrevising a trading limit upwards.312.    Besides, as I have mentioned in para 229 above, Mr Thio\n\ndid not approve the revisions single-handedly.313.    There is one other point I should mention.314.    In his AEIC at para 69, Mr Loo pointed out that in a memo\n\ndated 9 October 1997 to Mr Thio from the Credit Department of Amsteel Singapore, the aggregate\n\nmaximum limit for the first four clients in this group was proposed to be RM20m which Mr Thio agreed\n\nwith. Yet the approved trades were in excess of RM20m.315.    However, Mr Quek pointed out that at that time the only\n\nsecurity was a guarantee (from Lim Lean Heng).316.    Subsequently, further security was provided, eg. RM3m cash\n\nand there was a credit balance of over RM2m in a trust account which could be used to set-off\n\nagainst any outstanding balance (NE 236A to 237A).317.    Mr Yeo gave illustrations showing that this group was\n\nallowed to trade in large amounts of LKT shares and even exceeded the aggregate of their trading\n\nlimits (PCS paras 234 and 223).318.    However only the former point was taken in\n\ncross-examination but the latter was not taken specifically, so Mr Thio did not have a chance to\n\nrespond thereto.319.    Mr Thio said that for LKT and LKT A shares, they had\n\nbucked the downward trend and this group of clients were having a history of contra gains (NE 440B\n\nand 441E).",
        "THE DATO JERRY GOH GROUP AND THE TAI KAR GROUP - ROLL-OVERS AND SUMMARY": "320.    Another argument by Mr Yeo was that Mr Thio should not\n\nhave allowed members of the Dato Jerry Goh group and Tai Kar group to roll-over their trades among\n\nmembers of the same group whether directly or indirectly through other brokers.321.    Mr Yeo argued that roll-overs should not be permitted as\n\nthey continued to expose Amsteel Singapore to the risk of falling prices for the same shares.322.    As regards what ASMSB was doing, Mr Loo said that for\n\nmargin accounts, which have to be secured to some extent, the settlement of outstanding positions\n\ncould be rolled-over for a maximum of three months (NE 244C).323.    In my view, if roll-overs were as dangerous as Mr Yeo\n\ninitially sought to portray, then they should not have been allowed at all even for margin accounts.324.    As for Ms Tan, she said at NE 316C to E:Q Risk that Plaintiffs might be left holding the shares was part of the risk\n\n  of stockbroking?A Yes. However the frequency of roll over subjects Plaintiffs to higher degree\n\n  of risk.Q Do you know whether clients of Plaintiffs had to pay interest for extended\n\n  time of payment?A They had to.Q What frequency would make roll over acceptable and what would make it\n\n  unacceptable?A There is no cut-off point. It is subject to prudent management.325.    Her evidence was not confined to margin accounts only.326.    Mr Thio said that it was a prevalent practice among\n\nMalaysian stockbrokers to allow roll-overs (NE 356D). He was not challenged on this.327.    Indeed, in oral submissions, Mr Yeo said that he was not\n\nchallenging roll-overs per se.328.    Mr Yeo argued that it was foolhardy of Mr Thio to allow\n\nroll-overs to continue in view of the weak market conditions from early November 1997.329.    However, Mr Thio disagreed. He said that in some\n\ninstances, by allowing the clients to roll-over their trades, the clients eventually managed to\n\nreduce their exposure (NE 435E/F and 441C/D). He was not challenged on this.330.    Besides, for every roll-over among the clients, commission\n\nwas earned by Amsteel Singapore. Mr Thio did not allow the roll-overs for altruistic reasons only.331.    Mr Yeo also mentioned certain specific instances when\n\npurchases or roll-overs were allowed by Mr Thio even after 20 November 1997 (PCS paras 224 and 236\n\nand 237) but these specific instances were not taken up during cross-examination of Mr Thio who\n\ntherefore did not have an opportunity to respond thereto.332.    Besides, the roll-overs then may have been to release\n\npressure on the adjusted net capital requirement for Amsteel Singapore, as mentioned in another\n\ne-mail from Anita Chong dated 26 November 1997 (DSB 28).333.    Having considered all the allegations and all the factors,\n\nI am of the view that Amsteel Singapore has not established that Mr Thio was negligent in his many\n\ndecisions regarding the Dato Jerry Goh group and the Tai Kar group.",
        "SIM JOO HOCK AND TAN POH CHOON": "334.    These two clients were serviced by Mr Wu. The details of\n\nthis group are stated below.Name of debtorOccupationDate Account OpenedTrading Limit (RM / S$)(million)CollateralSim Joo HockManaging Director, Ambangan Services Corporation Sdn Bhd28.10.97(PSB 94 & 95)RM10/ S$4(PSB 94 & 95)Share collateral of 2 million Innovest shares pledged on 17.11.97.Mr Thios position is that there is an additional cash collateral of\n\n        RM1.8 million.Amsteel Singapore dispute this.Tan Poh ChoonDirector, YCS Power (M) Sdn Bhd28.10.97(PSB 108 & 109)RM10/ S$4(PSB 108 & 109)Share collateral as above was applicable to secure this account as well.335.    Mr Thio accepted that these two individuals were trading\n\nas a group.336.    Sim Joo Hock was the managing director of Ambangan\n\nServices Corporation Sdn Bhd (NE 428E/F).337.    Tan Poh Choon was a director of YCS Power Sdn Bhd (NE\n\n429A).338.    Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh Choon were both recommended by\n\none Eric Tan who was an existing client of Amsteel Singapore who was a local property developer and\n\na majority shareholder of Arus which was listed on the KLSE (Mr Thios AEIC para 111).339.    Sim Joo Hock was recommended as a big investor in\n\nSingapore and Malaysia (Mr Thios AEIC para 115).340.    Tan Poh Choon was recommended as an active and experienced\n\nshare investor and a consultant in corporate structuring matters (Mr Thios AEIC para 112).341.    One of Mr Thios statements to Ms Tan (PB 11) states:2)Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh ChoonThe above accounts were introduced by the dealer, Chris Wu who only had 2 to 3\n\n  months experience in securities dealing based on another client, Mr. Eric Tans recommendation.No further reference check was conducted on Mr.Sim and Mr.Tans background.342.    However, Mr Thio said in cross-examination (at NE 408E)\n\nthat he had already told Ms Tan (and her team) that he had met Sim Joo Hock twice and checked Sim\n\nJoo Hocks background, especially the brokers he dealt with in the past.343.    Mr Thio said this was an illustration as to how not\n\neverything in his statement was put in total context. Mr Thio was not challenged on his elaboration\n\nthat he did conduct checks on Sim Joo Hock.344.    Sim Joo Hock was also a client of ASMSB which granted him\n\na trading limit of RM6m (see the table at para 240 above). Although this was not as high as the\n\nRM10m trading limit granted to Sim Joo Hock by Amsteel Singapore, it shows that ASMSB also\n\nconsidered Sim Joo Hock to be an HNWI.345.    Mr Yeo said that Mr Thio did not even know that Sim Joo\n\nHock also had an account with ASMSB until this was mentioned during the trial. Mr Yeo argued that\n\nthe failure of Mr Thio to discover this showed that Mr Thio had not been thorough in his searches.\n\nYet Mr Yeo did not elaborate as to how searches done on Mr Thios instructions would have revealed\n\nsuch information. Besides, Mr Thio did not pretend that he could obtain such information from\n\nsearches. It depended on what each client had told him and inquiries made by him and members of his\n\nCredit Committee.346.    Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh Choon had wanted to purchase a\n\nhuge quantity of Innovest Bhd shares.347.    Mr Thio said that Mr Wu was told that Sim Joo Hock was\n\nbuying the Innovest shares for someone but Sim Joo Hock refused to disclose the identity of that\n\nperson. Mr Wu had also been told that Innovest would obtain a timber concession but this allegation\n\nwas disputed by Mr Yeo.348.    Mr Thio said he had asked Mr Wu whether he knew of any\n\nadverse news about Innovest and Mr Wu did not mention any (NE 447B).349.    For this group, two million Innovest Bhd shares were\n\nprovided as collateral.350.    Mr Thio said that there was also a cash security of RM1.8m\n\nbut Amsteel Singapores position was that the RM1.8m was actually taken from an existing RM2m\n\nwhich was supposed to be security for another account ie. the account of Tan Hun Leong. Therefore,\n\nits position was that the RM1.8m was not a separate and fresh sum over and above the RM2m.351.    The RM1.8m was mentioned in only one document (DB 42)\n\nwhich was a note attached to a fax dated 21 November 1997 from the Credit Committee to GP (DB 39 and\n\n40). This was a note on some outstanding positions prepared by Alex Chong (the Finance & Admin\n\nManager).352.    It stated, inter alia:2 A/C: R00399 & R00383 TAN POH CHOON & SIM JOO HOCKOUTSTANDING POSITION1,670,000InnovestRM 10,048,801.292,647,000InnovestRM 16,677,887.44_______________RM 26,726,688.73Cash Collateral:RM 1,800,000.00353.    On the other hand, this document omitted to mention the\n\ncollateral of two million Innovest shares which was not disputed.354.    The RM1.8m was not mentioned in Mr Wus statement dated\n\n3 December 1997 (PB 17 and 18), which was made before Ms Tan had commenced her investigation.355.    There was also a second statement from Mr Wu. This was\n\nmade at the time of Ms Tans investigation (PB 19 to 20). It was made on 24 December 1997 and this\n\nwas signed before Alex Chong. This statement also did not mention the RM1.8m cash collateral\n\nspecifically. Instead, it stated that RM2m cash collateral came into Sim Joo Hocks trust account\n\non 17 November 1997. It was meant as security to purchase shares in another counter known as Hotline\n\nfor another client ie. Tan Hun Leong (whose account had not yet been opened then). Sim Joo Hock had\n\nrequested to purchase Innovest shares on the back of this cash collateral as the share collateral of\n\ntwo million Innovest shares was provided only later, in the afternoon of 17 November 1997. This was\n\ninconsistent with Mr Wus earlier statement dated 3 December 1997 in which he had said that it was\n\nafter receiving the two million share collateral that Sim Joo Hock gave orders to buy the Innovest\n\nshares.356.    Mr Thios two statements to Ms Tan were not clear as to\n\nwhether the two million Innovest shares were provided as collateral before the first tranche of\n\nInnovest shares was purchased on 17 November 1997 or after. His evidence during cross-examination\n\n(at NE 447A to E) seemed to suggest that the share collateral was provided after the first tranche\n\nwas purchased but his AEIC at para 115 said it was before.357.    Unfortunately, Mr Wu and Alex Chong (who was the author of\n\nthe note referring to RM1.8m collateral) did not give evidence.358.    Mr Thio said that Mr Wu was not aware of his conversations\n\nwith Sim Joo Hock and Alex Chong regarding the requirement of the RM1.8m (NE 409D). That is why Mr\n\nWu did not mention the RM1.8m collateral in either of his (Mr Wus) two statements.359.    As regards PB 19 to 20, which was Mr Wus second\n\nstatement (signed in the presence of Alex Chong), Mr Thio argued that it was an oversight of Alex\n\nChong not to have mentioned the RM1.8m to Mr Wu.360.    Mr Thio insisted that based on the note prepared by Alex\n\nChong (DB 42) and on his own recollection, there was this RM1.8m cash collateral over and above the\n\nRM2m which was deposited to secure Tan Hun Leongs account.361.    Yet, the RM1.8m collateral was not mentioned in either of\n\nhis two statements to Ms Tan (PB 8 and 9, PB 10 to 13). It was also not mentioned in Mr Thios own\n\nAEIC.362.    On balance, I find that there was no additional cash\n\ncollateral of RM1.8m. I also find that the RM2m which was deposited in Sim Joo Hocks trust\n\naccount to secure the purchase of Hotline shares was temporarily used to secure the initial purchase\n\nof the Innovest shares until the two million Innovest shares were provided as collateral. The RM2m\n\nwas subsequently used as collateral for the purchase of Hotline shares for Tan Hun Leongs account\n\nof which I will say more about below.363.    The RM1.8m was a figure mentioned by Alex Chong in his\n\nnote as cash collateral for the purchases of Innovest shares. I find that he had made a mistake and\n\nthe figure should have been RM2m. When the two million Innovest shares were provided as collateral,\n\nhe omitted to substitute the cash collateral for the share collateral.364.    On 17 November 1997 the clients bought 3,317,000 Innovest\n\nshares in two tranches of 670,000 shares and 2,647,000 shares. On 18 November 1997, the clients\n\nbought another 1,000,000 Innovest shares. The total number purchased over two days was therefore\n\n4,317,000 Innovest shares.365.    I have found that the two million Innovest shares were the\n\nonly collateral as there was no RM1.8m as additional collateral. Even then, the two million Innovest\n\nshares constituted about 46% of the 4,317,000 Innovest shares purchased by these clients.366.    Mr Yeo made various arguments concerning this group.367.    First he made the point that the total purchase price for\n\nthe purchases over two days amounted to RM26,616,000 which was in excess of the total trading limit\n\nof RM20m given to these two clients.368.    Mr Thio said he was aware of this. He said it was a\n\ntemporary increase in trading limit and he was prepared to allow it based on the two million\n\nInnovest shares and RM1.8m collateral. As there was no additional RM1.8m, I find that he had allowed\n\nthe temporary excess based only on the two million Innovest shares as collateral. Even then, the two\n\nmillion Innovest shares constituted about 46% of the 4,317,000 Innovest shares purchased over the\n\ntwo days.369.    Secondly, Mr Yeo argued that Mr Thio had disregarded\n\nprudence when he allowed Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh Choon to trade in such high volumes on their first\n\nday of trading on 17 November 1997.370.    I do not agree that Mr Thio had disregarded prudence. He\n\nhad obtained 46% share collateral. This was more than the general requirement of 20% for share\n\ncollateral, imposed by his internal management.371.    However Mr Yeo also said that after the price drop in the\n\nlater part of 18 November 1997, Mr Thio had demanded that the clients pay 50% cash before the date\n\nfor payment was due. Mr Yeo argued that this demonstrated that Mr Thio had realised what an\n\nunjustified risk or gamble he had taken.372.    I do not agree.373.    Mr Thio did not at the relevant time think it was an\n\nunjustified risk or gamble given the collateral that he had obtained. The fall in Innovests share\n\nprice on 18 November 1997, alerted him to take swift action because the value of the share\n\ncollateral was drastically affected too. In my view, the move by him to get 50% cash demonstrated\n\nhis responsiveness to changes in the market when he was aware of such changes and not a lack of\n\nprudence in his initial decision to allow the trades in Innovest shares. He exercised his judgment\n\nin the initial decision which turned out to be wrong because he did not foresee the drastic fall in\n\nInnovests share price, but that did not mean that he had been negligent.374.    Mr Yeos third argument was that Mr Thio should not have\n\naccepted shares of the same counter as collateral because if the share price of the counter drops\n\nthen the value of the collateral would also drop. He was therefore arguing that Mr Thio should have\n\nobtained shares from another counter as collateral.375.    While it is logical to say that the value of the share\n\ncollateral of the same counter would drop in tandem with the drop in price of the shares being\n\nbought, it does not follow that Mr Thio was negligent in accepting share collateral of the same\n\ncounter. It was better than no collateral and the number of shares held as collateral was a\n\nsubstantial one.376.    Furthermore, a client may not have shares of another\n\ncounter to be provided as security or may not wish to provide shares of another counter as security.\n\nIndeed, Mr Wus statement to Ms Tan (at PB 19) said that Mr Thio had asked for shares of various\n\ncounters as collateral but only shares in Innovest were provided.377.    The alternative was not to allow the trades at all but Mr\n\nThio thought he had adequate security.378.    As for ASMSBs practice, Ms Tan said that ASMSB may have\n\nalso accepted shares of the same counter as collateral (NE 307E to 308B). From the documentary\n\nevidence, ASMSB did do so, see DSB 137 and 139.379.    I also note that none of the witnesses for Amsteel\n\nSingapore had gone so far as to say that Mr Thio was negligent in failing to obtain shares from\n\nanother counter as security. That was Mr Yeos argument.380.    In the circumstances, I am of the view that Mr Thio was\n\nnot negligent in failing to obtain shares from a different counter as security.381.    Mr Yeos fourth argument was that the Innovest shares\n\nhad been suspended and subsequently re-quoted on 14 November 1997. On that day, the price of\n\nInnovest shares had dropped drastically twice by a total of RM3.61. This was just before the first\n\npurchase was made by Sim through Amsteel Singapore in the morning of 17 November 1997.382.    Mr Thio was unaware of such a steep price drop until after\n\n20 November 1997 (NE 445A). Apparently Mr Wu did not mention this to him as Mr Wu was also unaware.383.    Mr Yeo argued that Mr Thio had not exercised due diligence\n\nand if he had, he would have discovered that the shares had been suspended and re-quoted on 14\n\nNovember 1997 and that its share price had dropped by a total of RM3.61 that day. The suggestion was\n\nthat had Mr Thio known all these facts, he would not have allowed the trades in Innovest shares or\n\nrequired more and/or different security.384.    There was no evidence before me that knowledge of a\n\nsuspension of trading per se would have caused a stockbroker to be more wary of the share after it\n\nwas re-quoted on the KLSE.385.    There was also no evidence before me as to how many other\n\nstockbrokers knew or did not know about the price drops for Innovest on 14 November 1997 and what\n\nsteps they took.386.    Mr Yeo also suggested that Mr Thio was imprudent for\n\nrelying on Mr Wu to bring up any adverse news about Innovest because Mr Wu was relatively\n\ninexperienced in the stockbroking industry and the price fluctuations of Innovest shares on the\n\nFriday before 17 November 1997 ie. 14 November 1997 were not normal.387.    I am of the view that the latter point is a non-issue. Mr\n\nThio himself was unaware of the price fluctuations on 14 November 1997. This was not a case where he\n\nwas aware but had allowed Mr Wu to convince him that his own information was wrong.388.    As for Mr Thios having relied on Mr Wu for adverse\n\nnews, I do not think this was a case of over-reliance. True, Mr Wu was relatively inexperienced but\n\nMr Thio could not be expected to know every aspect about every counter or every client. He had to\n\nplace some reliance on dealers and remisiers as well as on others like members of the Credit\n\nCommittee.389.    Mr Yeo also said that the purchases done through Amsteel\n\nSingapore for Innovest on 17 November 1997 constituted about 20% of the market total that day. He\n\nwas implying that the Sim Joo Hock and Tan Poh Choon group had purchased the largest quantity that\n\nday. Even if this were true, it was neither here nor there. Obviously there were other stockbrokers\n\nwho were also prepared to allow their clients to buy Innovest shares that day. There was no evidence\n\nbefore me as to what sort of security these other stockbrokers had obtained, if at all any, for\n\nthese trades. There was no evidence before me as to what ASMSB did as regards Innovest shares.390.    None of the witnesses for Amsteel Singapore accused Mr\n\nThio of failing to act with due diligence for failing to know about the previous suspension of\n\nInnovest shares and that the price of Innovest had dropped twice on 14 November 1997.391.    Also, apparently, Amsteel Capital with its support staff\n\nto supervise or oversee the regional offices did not see it fit to send a warning notice to Amsteel\n\nSingapore (or ASMSB for that matter) about the price drops of Innovest on 14 November 1997 as there\n\nwas no evidence of such a warning.392.    I would add that the price of Innovest shares at the close\n\nof trading on 17 November 1997 was higher than the prices at which this group had bought that same\n\nday. It was only after they bought another one million shares in the morning of 18 November 1997\n\nthat the price dropped drastically.393.    I am of the view that Mr Thios lack of knowledge of the\n\nsuspension and of the subsequent drops in the prices of Innovest on 14 November 1997 did not amount\n\nto negligence.394.    I am of the view that Amsteel Singapore has failed to\n\nestablish negligence in respect of Mr Thios decisions for this group.",
        "Tan Hun Leong @ Tan Hang Kiang": "395.    Tan Hun Leong was also serviced by Mr Wu. He is the only\n\nindividual in this fourth and last group. Details of his account are stated below:Name of debtorOccupationDate Account OpenedTrading Limit (RM / S$)(million)CollateralTan Hun Leong alias Tan Hang KiangDirector, Zimmark Corporation (M) Sdn Bhd19.11.97(PSB 120 & 121/ AB760)Not stated in account opening form(PSB 121/ AB 760)Cash collateral RM2m.396.    Tan Hun Leong was a director of Zimmark Corporation Sdn\n\nBhd. He was a nominee of Lim Kie Peng who was a director of Hotline.397.    Sim Joo Hock (who has been mentioned above) had introduced\n\nMr Wu to Lim Kie Peng who had in turn given a power of attorney to Tan Hun Leong. However the\n\ntrading account was opened in Mr Tans name.398.    On 17 November 1997, RM2m cash collateral was deposited in\n\nSim Joo Hocks trust account for an intended purchase of Hotline shares for Mr Tans account\n\nwhich had not yet been opened as he had not yet signed the application form to open the account. As\n\nI have mentioned above, this RM2m was used temporarily to secure the purchase of Innovest shares on\n\n17 November 1997, and then to secure the purchase of Hotline shares. Eventually, a total number of\n\n1,322,000 Hotline shares were bought for about RM7.5m (see DSB 84, PSB 865 and NE 442E).399.    Mr Thio said he had on 17 November 1997 already granted a\n\ntrading limit of RM10m to Mr Tan. The account opening form for Mr Tan was signed on 19 November 1997\n\nwhen he came to Singapore bringing a power of attorney and a letter of undertaking from Lim Kie Peng\n\n(NE 443A to B). However the form did not specify the trading limit. Neither did it have Mr Thios\n\nsignature to signify his approval to the opening of the account. All the account opening forms for\n\nthe clients in the other three groups had Mr Thios signature.400.    Mr Thio said that the absence of any written trading limit\n\nin the form and the absence of his signature on the form was an oversight (NE 443C). Yet Mr Yeo\n\nsought to make something out of it. I am of the view that Mr Thios evidence on this point should\n\nbe accepted and nothing much should be made out of the absence of any written trading limit or of Mr\n\nThios signature in the account opening form.401.    Mr Thio said that the background of Lim Kie Peng and the\n\ncash collateral warranted his decision to allow the purchases of Hotline shares to be made (NE\n\n443E).402.    There was no evidence of any other check done by Mr Thio\n\non Lim Kie Peng except that Mr Thio was informed that he was the Managing Director of Hotline. Also,\n\nMr Thio did not say that he had conducted other checks.403.    I am of the view that Mr Thio had allowed these purchases\n\n(of RM7.5m) to be made because (a) of the cash collateral of RM2m and (b) Lim Kie Pengs position\n\nas Managing Director of Hotline. The fact that it was Sim Joo Hock who had introduced Lim Kie Peng\n\nmust also have featured in Mr Thios mind.404.    In the circumstances, I am of the view that Mr Thio was\n\nnot negligent in allowing Tan Hun Leong to purchase the Hotline shares.",
        "COMMON CLIENTS OF AMSTEEL SINGAPORE AND ASMSB": "463.    In the context of common clients between ASMSB and Amsteel\n\nSingapore, Mr Yeo argued that Mr Thio should not have granted high trading limits to, for example,\n\nChew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong as they already had high trading limits from ASMSB.464.    Mr Thios evidence was that he knew in early November\n\n1997 the high trading limits granted by ASMSB to Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim Tee Keong (NE 415F,\n\n416E, 417C).465.    In any event, as Mr Thio put it, the reality was such that\n\nthe same clients were being sought after by stockbrokers (NE 419F). I agree and I am of the view\n\nthat this is not a practice peculiar to stockbrokers.466.    Furthermore, no witness said that Mr Thio should have\n\nrefrained from granting high trading limits to these clients in view of what ASMSB had already\n\ngranted them.467.    There was also no directive from Amsteel Capital that its\n\nregional entities must either refrain from having common clients or exchange information to ensure\n\nthat the group did not over-extend itself on the same client. It will also be re-called that Mr Thio\n\nhad said that when he initially checked with ASMSB, on potential common clients, ASMSB was not very\n\nkeen to share information with him (NE 353A/B).",
        "OTHER COMPARISONS BETWEEN AMSTEEL SINGAPORE AND ASMSB": "468.    From the evidence produced by Amsteel Singapore, the top\n\nfive debtors of ASMSB had each been given high trading limits too. For Chew Kar Hooi and Dato Lim\n\nTee Keong, they had also traded in MCL and Esprit.469.    Mr Yeo argued that the top five debtors of ASMSB were\n\nserviced by the same remisier, Mr Peter Sia. Mr Yeos argument was that their losses were not\n\nsuggestive of the corporate culture at ASMSB but rather mismanagement by the particular remisier\n\ninvolved.470.    I do not agree. It is clear that Amsteel Capital knew what\n\nwas happening in ASMSB. GP was the MD of ASMSB. The office of Amsteel Capital was just below the\n\noffices of ASMSB in the same building.471.    The aggressive approach which led to ASMSBs losses was\n\nvery much the corporate culture of ASMSB.472.    In addition, Mr Sia was not just some rogue remisier. He\n\nwas also an executive director of ASMSB and still a 10% shareholder at the material time (NE 8F to\n\n9A, NE 323C).473.    Mr Yeo sought to argue that this put Mr Sia in a somewhat\n\nspecial position. However I am of the view that Mr Sias approach was not very different from what\n\nthe rest of ASMSB were doing. I do not accept that Amsteel Capital was prepared to let him adopt an\n\naggressive approach while insisting that the rest of ASMSB must be more conservative.474.    Mr Yeo also argued that it was a striking feature that\n\nmost of the accounts of the top five debtors showed no purchase transactions between November 1997\n\nto June 1998. He said this was significant as that was the time when the trades which led to Amsteel\n\nSingapores losses were made (PCS para 372). By implication, Mr Yeo sought to argue that this\n\nshowed that ASMSB had taken precautions whereas Mr Thios Amsteel Singapore had not.475.    I have already dealt with this point in paras 414 to 421\n\nabove.476.    Mr Yeo had another argument. He pointed out that ASMSBs\n\noperating loss for end of the financial year 1998 ie. 30 June 1998 was about RM148m. In comparison,\n\nAmsteel Singapores loss was about RM98m (PCS para 367).477.    Mr Yeo said that ASMSBs operating loss as compared to\n\nits monthly turnover or its shareholders funds was less than that of Amsteel Singapores.\n\nAccordingly, he argued that in relation to the volume of business done and financial resources,\n\nASMSB had not over-extended itself whereas Amsteel Singapore had. He suggested that this showed that\n\nMr Thio had poorer risk management then ASMSB (NE 332F).478.    I do not agree with this argument.479.    ASMSBs losses were huge. They were less than that\n\nof Amsteel Singapore if ASMSBs losses were compared to its turnover or shareholders funds, but\n\nnot in absolute terms.480.    The reason why ASMSBs losses were less was\n\nfortuitous. As I have mentioned, ASMSB had started to force-sell shares of certain defaulting\n\nclients from July 1997 and the main impact of the financial crisis did not hit until 20 November\n\n1997. Had the financial crisis hit home on, say, 1 August 1997, ASMSBs losses would have been\n\ngreater and Amsteel Singapores losses would have been very much less because Amsteel Singapore\n\nhad only started trading on 28 July 1997.481.    Also, had these defaulting clients of ASMSB not had huge\n\noutstanding balances as at July 1997 but later, ASMSB would not have taken steps to force-sell their\n\nshares from July 1997.482.    Mr Yeo had a third argument. Under the regulations passed\n\nunder the Securities Industry Act, stockbrokers have to meet a certain requirement pertaining to\n\nadjusted net capital (ANC).483.    Mr Yeo sought to make something out of the fact that\n\nAmsteel Singapore failed to meet the ANC requirement but this was due to the severe losses it had\n\nsuffered. It was not as though Amsteel Singapore was consistently in breach of the ANC requirement\n\nthroughout its period of operations.484.    Besides, as Mr Thio pointed out, ASMSB also failed at the\n\nrelevant time to meet the Malaysian equivalent of the ANC requirement which was the Minimum Liquid\n\nFund requirement.485.    At the end of the day, Mr Yeo impliedly conceded that\n\nASMSB had engaged in similar practices as Mr Thios Amsteel Singapore when he urged me to bear in\n\nmind that ASMSB was a different entity from Amsteel Capital. In so doing, he sought to distance\n\nAmsteel Capital from what was happening in ASMSB. Such an argument must fail for the reasons I have\n\nmentioned in para 470 above.",
        "OTHER STOCKBROKERS": "486.    Mr Yeo said that other more prudent stockbroking companies\n\nhad managed to weather the storm but Amsteel Singapore did not. He argued that this demonstrated the\n\nunwarranted risks that Mr Thio took.487.    I am of the view that this is not a valid argument.488.    In the first place, there is no evidence about the\n\npractices of other stockbroking companies.489.    There is also very little evidence as to how other\n\nstockbroking companies performed during the crisis. True, some must have managed to weather the\n\ncrisis, but others did not. Some must have been conservative and others more aggressive.\n\nFurthermore, some had more aggressive clients than others. The fact that huge losses have been\n\nincurred does not necessarily constitute negligence. Often the persons who are regarded as\n\nvisionaries, when times are good, are the same persons who are accused of negligence when disaster\n\nbefalls.490.    I also reiterate that Ms Seet had said in her AEIC that\n\neven the most prudent and careful dealers and investors were caught off-guard and defenceless\n\nagainst huge losses.",
        "WHETHER THE CLIENTS IN THE FOUR GROUPS CAN PAY THEIR LOSSES": "491.    Amsteel Singapore has reached a settlement with Mr Lye on\n\nhis indemnity (as a dealer) to it.492.    For the Tai Kar group, Amsteel Singapore has also reached\n\na settlement in which RM11m is to be paid over four years.493.    According to Mr Loo at NE 252C to E, the settlement was\n\nreached after this group gave Amsteel Singapore grief over its litigation and the board of directors\n\nof Amsteel Singapore felt that suing all of them would be a long-drawn affair.494.    There is insufficient evidence before me to establish that\n\nthis group and Lim Lean Heng (the guarantor) would have been unable to pay for their losses.\n\nLikewise, for the rest of the other three groups in question. The evidence only establishes that\n\nthey had not paid their losses.",
        "SUMMARY": "495.    I find that Mr Thio was caught up in the grand vision for\n\nthe Amsteel Securities group. He decided to take an aggressive approach which was condoned, if not\n\nencouraged, by Amsteel Capital.496.    Yeo argued that Mr Thio did nothing to monitor or\n\nsupervise the trades carried out by his dealers. I do not agree. Mr Thio was aware of the trades\n\ndone. He was aware of the risks and he exercised his judgment. As events turned out, he was wrong,\n\nbut he was neither wilful nor negligent.497.    Mr Yeo urged me to consider the various allegations\n\nagainst Mr Thio cumulatively and not in isolation. I have done that and I am not satisfied that\n\nAmsteel Singapore has established its case.498.    Perhaps the most telling evidence came from one of the\n\nwitnesses for Amsteel Singapore, Mr Lye. At NE 275F to 276E he said:Q In your dealings with Defendant, did you find him conscientious and\n\n  responsible?A Defendant was a good boss. He was responsible. During that time he was trying\n\n  his best to do more business for Plaintiffs bearing in mind it was a new set-up. Even as a friend,\n\n  he was kind. He was always there to listen and never asked for anything back in return despite\n\n  helping a friend.Q Given the facts known and facts that were reasonably foreseeable, Defendant\n\n  had acted reasonably and to the best of his ability?A Defendant did what he could bearing in mind uncertainty at the time.Q In your AEIC, it is not your intention to suggest that Defendant has been in\n\n  neglect of duty anyway?A My AEIC contains facts. I think Defendant did what he could.499.    In the circumstances, the claim of Amsteel Singapore is\n\ndismissed.500.    I will hear the parties on costs.Woo Bih LiJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
