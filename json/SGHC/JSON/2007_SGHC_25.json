        "The scope of the compensation award": "12     The first issue concerns a determination of a question of fact. The defendants relied on the compensation report to support their contention that the compensation award covered all of the plaintiff’s conditions as at 2004. The plaintiff had submitted that this report did not unequivocally resolve the scope of the compensation award. Whilst the report, which was prepared after an assessment that took place more than a year after the accident, did suggest that the plaintiff’s entire medical condition as at June 2004 had been taken into consideration, this had to be weighed against the fact that the report only made reference to the plaintiff’s pre-existing medical problems arising from the original accident in 2003. No reference was made anywhere in the report to the plaintiff’s affliction with RSD, or the damage sustained to his radial nerve. In addition, the doctor’s recommended award of 44% for “permanent incapacity” was ambiguous in that it did not have any further explanation as to the severity of injury that this figure signified. 13     These are factual issues that have to be decided after evaluation of the evidence adduced in the trial, in particular that of the doctor who made the compensation report. The burden is on the plaintiff to prove them, but it is not appropriate at this stage to strike out his claim. This ground alone would be sufficient to justify the dismissal of the defendants’ applications.",
        "The compensability of the plaintiff’s injuries": "14     The second issue pertains to the interpretation of s 18(a). The analysis must proceed on the assumption that that the plaintiff is able to prove the facts alleged in his statement of claim. Section 18(a) of the Act provides as follows: 18. Where any injury for which compensation is payable under this Act was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in some person other than the employer to pay damages in respect thereof— (a)    the workman may take proceedings against that person to recover damages and may claim against any person liable to pay compensation under this Act, but he shall not be entitled to recover both damages and compensation; The bar to recovery of both damages and compensation is in relation to an “injury for which compensation is payable” under the Act. The question then is whether the injury the subject of this suit is one for which compensation is payable under the Act. 15     The liability of an employer to pay compensation under the Act is set out in s 3(1) which provides as follows: 3. —(1) If in any employment personal injury by accidentarising out of and in the course of the employmentis caused to a workman, his employer shall be liable to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act.[emphasis added] It is clear from the words emphasised in s 3(1) above that the injury compensable under the Act must be caused by an accident arising out of and in the course of the employment. In the present case the industrial accident had caused an injury to the plaintiff’s left wrist. The defendants had, at some point, proposed to the plaintiff a particular course of treatment but had breached their duty to obtain informed consent for it from the plaintiff. In the event the wrist arthroscopy carried out had caused the injury which is the subject of the plaintiff’s claim in this suit, the question is whether such injury falls within the ambit of s 3(1) of the Act. 16     To put the issues in perspective, it is useful to consider the following scenario. A workman’s hand is mangled by machinery at his workplace and is treated in a hospital. A known complication develops, say gangrene sets in, and his hand is amputated. As this is a natural consequence of the injury, he is clearly entitled under the Act to compensation for the loss of the hand. Introducing a new element, the ambulance conveying him to the hospital meets with an accident when a drunk driver runs a red light and crashes into the ambulance. The workman sustains leg injuries for which his foot has to be amputated. It is equally clear that this injury did not arise out of and in the course of the employment but out of the negligence of the drunk driver. The issue before me is on which side of the divide lies the circumstances of the present case. 17     This issue does not appear to have been considered in Singapore. However the decision of the English Court of Appeal inRothwell v Caverswall Stone Co Ltd[1944] 2 All ER 350 is instructive on this point. The plaintiff there had met with an accident at his workplace and sustained a fractured dislocation of the right shoulder. However the first doctor who treated him negligently failed to diagnose the fractured dislocation. Had he been so diagnosed, the plaintiff could have fully recovered from this injury. When it was finally discovered by another doctor, it was too late for effective treatment and his right arm was permanently incapacitated. The Court of Appeal decided, by a majority, that the workman’s incapacity did not result from the injury for the purpose of a compensation award under the English Workmen’s Compensation Act 1925. The dissenting judge, Scott LJ, took the view that, having regard to the social policy underlying the Workmen’s Compensation Act, the scope of the award covered all damages resulting from the injuries suffered by a workman in an industrial accident. However the majority held that they were bound by a line of authority beginning withHumber Towing Co v Barclay(1911) 5 BWCC 142, and which includedRocco v Jones (Stanley) & Co Ltd(1914) 7 BWCC 101, which held that negligent treatment by a doctor may constitute a new cause which has intervened in the chain of causation so that the incapacity of the workman was not attributable to the industrial accident. Du Parcq LJ summarised the state of the law in the following manner at p 365: “In my opinion, the following propositions may be formulated upon the authorities as they stand: first, an existing incapacity \"results from\" the original injury if it follows, and is caused by, that injury, and may properly be held so to result even if some supervening cause has aggravated the effects of the original injury and prolonged the period of incapacity. If, however, the existing incapacity ought fairly to be attributed to a new cause which has intervened and ought no longer to be attributed to the original injury, it may properly be held to result from the new cause and not from the original injury, even though, but for the original injury, there would have been no incapacity. Secondly, negligent or inefficient treatment by a doctor or other person may amount to a new cause and the circumstances may justify a finding of fact that the existing incapacity results from the new cause, and does not result from the original injury. This is so even if the negligence or inefficient treatment consists of an error of omission whereby the original incapacity is prolonged. In such a case, if the arbitrator is satisfied that the incapacity would have wholly ceased but for the omission, a finding of fact that the existing incapacity results from the new cause, and not from the injury, will be justified. In stating these propositions I am far from seeking to lay down any new principles of construction. I have sought only to collect, by a process of induction, such general, and necessarily vague, rules as seem to emerge from the decided cases. Such rules do no more than indicate the bounds within which an arbitrator is free to decide – the province of fact. It is constantly being said, and must always be remembered, that the arbitrator is the sole judge of the facts.” 18     This part of the speech of Du Parcq LJ was cited and described as an accurate statement of the law by Lord Simonds, Lord Normand, Lord Morton of Henryton and Lord Reid inHogan v Bentinck West Hartley Collieries[1949] 1 All ER 588. The workman there suffered from a congenital defect, viz. he had an extra thumb in his right hand. He met with an industrial accident and fractured the false thumb. It was treated by splinting but he continued to be in pain. He was then sent to the hospital where it was discovered that the fracture had not united. He was advised that an operation was required to remove not just the false thumb, but also the top joint of the normal thumb. The result of this operation was unsatisfactory as it left him with a tender stump which rendered him fit for light work only. The workman applied for compensation on the ground of this incapacity. The House of Lords held, by a majority, that this incapacity was not the result of the injury which was caused by the industrial accident. Whether a particular intervening act has become the supervening cause of the injury suffered by the workman was a question of fact to be determined by the arbitrator upon all the circumstances of the case. The two dissenting judges, Lord MacDermott and Lord Reid, were of the opinion that in interpreting the words “results from the injury” in the Act, regard ought to had for the social policy of the legislation. Lord Reid stated that the Court of Appeal was correct in holding that it was bound by authority but he was of the view that the House of Lords, not being bound, ought to change the law as it stood. 19     The law in England in this regard has been established since 1911 inHumber Towing Co v Barclay, confirmed by the court of appeal in 1944 inRothwell v Caverswall Stone Co Ltd, and affirmed by the House of Lords in 1949 inHogan v Bentinck West Hartley Collieries. Employers and, more importantly, insurers in setting their premiums would have had regard to this position of the law when they assumed their liabilities. I can see no reason not to apply these authorities in Singapore. 20     Applying the statement of the law inRothwell v Caverswall Stone Co Ltd, that: (a)    negligent or inefficient treatment by a doctor may amount to a new cause and circumstancesmay justify a finding of fact that the existing incapacity results from the new cause, and does not result from the original injury, and (b)    the court, if satisfied that the incapacity would have wholly ceased but for the negligent or inefficient treatment, may make a finding of fact that the existing incapacity results from the new cause, and not from the workplace injury. I find that, on the assumption that the plaintiff is able to prove his pleaded case, the injury is not compensable under the Act on account of thenovus actus interveniensof the defendants. Accordingly, the plaintiff is not precluded by s 18(a) from proceeding in this suit. 21     Counsel for the defendants submitted that if the compensation awarded to the plaintiff, which has already been paid to him, had included a sum for the further damages caused by the wrist arthroscopy, then permitting him to proceed with this suit would amount to double recovery. I see no merit in this argument. Either the injury is compensable under the Act or it is not. If it is not, then the fact that he has been compensated under the Act, erroneously it would seem, for those injuries does not act as a bar to this suit. I would have thought that it is recoverable from the plaintiff at the instance of the party who had made the payment but, as this may well be the subject of another action, I will go no further than this.",
        "Conclusion": "22     For these reasons, I allowed the appeals and set aside the Assistant Registrar’s order striking out the plaintiff’s pleadings in this suit."
