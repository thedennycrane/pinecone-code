        "Introduction": "1       This\nis an application by Mr Michael Fordham QC (“the Applicant”) forad hocadmission under s 15 of the Legal\nProfession Act (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“LPA”). The Applicant seeks\nadmission to represent Mr Deepak Sharma (“Mr Sharma”) in the latter’s\napplication for judicial review against the decision of a Review\nCommittee (“RC”) constituted under s 85(6) of the LPA in respect\nof his complaint to the Law Society of Singapore against two solicitors,\nnamely, Mr Alvin Yeo SC (“Mr Yeo SC”) and Ms Melanie Ho (“Ms Ho”).\nThe RC had wholly dismissed Mr Sharma’s complaint against Mr Yeo\nSC and partially dismissed it against Ms Ho. By way of background, Mr Sharma’s\ncomplaint arose in connection with several costs orders made against\nhis wife, Dr Susan Lim (“Dr Lim”), following the dismissal of various\napplications and appeals brought by Dr Lim against the Singapore Medical\nCouncil (“SMC”) in the course of earlier disciplinary proceedings. 2       The\nentire saga concerning the disciplinary proceedings against Dr Lim\nhas already gone through two rounds of hearings before the Disciplinary\nCommittee of the SMC, which found her guilty of professional misconduct\nfor overcharging. Dr Lim was suspended from medical practice for\nthree years, censured and fined $10,000. She appealed to the High\nCourt but this was eventually dismissed. In the present application,\nthe events which occurredpriorto\nDr Lim’s aforementioned appeal are material. It is pertinent to\nnote that Dr Lim had challenged certain procedural decisions of\nthe SMC by initiating two applications in the High Court, one of\nwhich was subsequently withdrawn while the other made its way to\nthe Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal ultimately dismissed Dr\nLim’s appeal in respect of the latter application with costs ordered\nagainst her. When no agreement could be reached on the costs ordered\nagainst Dr Lim, the SMC’s lawyers, Wong Partnership LLP (“Wong P”)\nfiled their bills of costs for taxation in the High Court and, upon\ntaxation, the costs were significantly reduced. In an ironic twist\nof events, the saga continues with Dr Lim’s husband, Mr Sharma,\nlodging a complaint against the SMC’s lawyers for gross overcharging\nas evidenced by the significant reduction of costs on taxation,\nthe very same act of professional misconduct which led to his wife’s\nsuspension. 3       Apart\nfrom the intense publicity generated by the entire episode, there are\nseveral unusual features in this application as well as in the underlying application\nfor judicial review. 4       First,\nthis is not a typical judicial review filed by a party directly aggrieved\nby an administrative body’s decision. The complaint was filed not by\nDr Lim, but by her husband instead. No explanation was forthcoming\nas to why the complaint was not filed by the party who is liable\nto pay the costs to the SMC,ie,\nDr Lim. Mr Sharma purported to demonstrate his interest in the complaint\nby stating that he was the “co-funder”\nof Dr Lim’s legal fees and that he owed it to his “conscience\nto make this complaint”. However, during the hearing\nbefore me, he adopted the position that the complaint can be filed\nby anyone without having to establish any standing. Such an unusual\napplication not unexpectedly raises interesting issues on Mr Sharma’slocus standiwhich I will address below. 5       Second,\nthead hocadmission application\nis also unusual in one very unique fact. The Applicant in his statement\nin support of his application asserted that he should be admitted\n“[n]otwithstanding that I do not satisfy all the requirements under\ns 15” of the LPA. I note that this is the first application forad hocadmission where the Applicant himself\naccepted that the requirements under s 15 are not satisfied. However,\nthe Applicant purported to correct his statement by subsequently\nfiling a corrective affidavit (a) without leave of court, (b) without\nexplaining why he had earlier stated that he did not satisfy the\nrequirements under s 15, and (c) what caused him to reverse his\nposition. 6       I\nwill return to discuss these peculiarities in due course. At this juncture,\nhowever, it is perhaps appropriate to elaborate on the relevant background\nfacts in greater detail.",
        "Background facts": "7       On\n23 January 2014, Mr Sharma made a complaint to the Law Society under\ns 85(1) of the LPA against Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho of Wong P.[note: 1]In essence,\nthe complaint alleged that Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were guilty of professional\nmisconduct in seeking grossly excessive party-and-party costs against\nDr Lim in Originating Summons No 1131 of 2010 (“OS 1131/2010”),\nOriginating Summons No 1252 of 2010 (“OS 1252/2010”) and Civil Appeal\nNo 80 of 2011 (“CA 80/2011”).[note: 2]OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and\nCA 80/2011 were all filed in the course of a separate set of proceedings between\nDr Lim and the SMC, which had been represented by Wong P throughout.\nThose proceedings were set in motion by a complaint of overcharging\nagainst Dr Lim in late 2007 and culminated only in June 2013 with\nthe High Court’s decision inLim Mey Lee Susan\nv Singapore Medical Council[2013] 3 SLR 900 (“Susan Lim”), which upheld the decision\nof a Disciplinary Committee appointed by the SMC to convict Dr Lim\non 94 charges of professional misconduct. The procedural history\nleading up to the decision inSusan Limis\nset out in detail at [3]–[23] of the judgment. For present purposes,\nit is only necessary to highlight the following facts to place Mr\nSharma’s complaint in its proper context.",
        "The proceedings between the\nSMC and Dr Lim": "8       On\n3 December 2007, an official of the Ministry of Health, Singapore (“MOHS”)\nlodged a complaint against Dr Lim with the SMC (Susan\nLimat [11]). This complaint expressed MOHS’s concern\nover the sums invoiced by Dr Lim for the treatment of one of her\npatients and concluded that MOHS was referring the matter to the\nSMC for a thorough investigation. The complaint was laid before\na Complaints Committee which, after having invited and reviewed\nDr Lim’s written explanation, made an order on 17 November 2008\nthat a formal inquiry be held by a Disciplinary Committee (Susan Limat [12]). A Disciplinary Committee\n(“the First DC”) was duly appointed to inquire into MOHS’s complaint. 9       On\n20 July 2009, the First DC issued a notice of inquiry to Dr Lim containing\n94 charges of professional misconduct under s 45(1)(d)\nof the Medical Registration Act (Cap 174, 2004 Rev Ed) (Susan Limat [14]). The hearing before\nthe First DC commenced on 28 January 2010 and, at the close of the\nProsecution’s case, counsel for Dr Lim made a submission of no case\nto answer. A three-day hearing commencing on 29 July 2010 was fixed for\noral submissions but, as it turned out, the First DC recused itself\nafter an application was made by Dr Lim’s counsel on the basis that\nthe First DC had prejudged the matter (Susan\nLimat [14]). 10     Subsequently,\nthe SMC proceeded to appoint a fresh Disciplinary Committee (“the\nSecond DC”) on 14 September 2010 (Susan Limat\n[15]). This prompted Dr Lim to file OS 1131/2010 and OS 1252/2010\non 1 November 2010 and 17 December 2010 respectively.[note: 3] 11     OS\n1131/2010 was an application that the SMC had no right to use the patient’s\nconfidential medical records in disciplinary proceedings against Dr Lim\nwithout the consent of the patient’s next-of-kin. However, it was later\nwithdrawn on 21 February 2011 after the SMC produced a letter from the\npatient’s next-of-kin which permitted the use of her medical records.[note: 4]OS 1252/2010 was a judicial review\napplication for a quashing order against the SMC’s decision to appoint\nthe Second DC. This application was heard before Philip Pillai J,\nwho granted leave for judicial review (seeLim\nMey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical Council[2011] SGHC\n131) but eventually dismissed the application for a quashing order\non 26 May 2011 (seeLim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore\nMedical Council[2011] 4 SLR 156). 12     CA\n80/2011 was Dr Lim’s appeal against Pillai J’s decision. It was dismissed\nby the Court of Appeal on 30 November 2011 with costs ordered against\nher (seeLim Mey Lee Susan v Singapore Medical\nCouncil[2012] 1 SLR 701).",
        "The claim for costs against\nDr Lim": "13     In\na letter dated 12 March 2012, the SMC’s solicitors (ie,\nWong P) sought to recover party-and-party costs against Dr Lim in\nrespect of OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and CA 80/2011.[note: 5]The sums claimed were disputed and\nDr Lim’s solicitors offered a counter-proposal in their reply to Wong\nP on 8 June 2012.[note: 6]Wong P did not agree to\nthis counter-proposal and thus proceeded to draw up three bills\nof costs for taxation in respect of OS 1131/2010, OS 1252/2010 and\nCA 80/2011 which totalled $1,007,009.37.[note: 7]At the taxation hearing\non 25 June 2013, the Assistant Registrar taxed off approximately\ntwo-thirds of the total sum claimed in the three bills, allowing\nthe recovery of only $340,000.[note: 8] 14     Dissatisfied\nwith the outcome, Wong P applied for a review of the taxation which\nwas heard by Woo Bih Li J on 12 August 2013. Prior to the review\nhearing, Wong P, on their own accord, reduced the total quantum\nof costs sought to $720,000, which was $287,009.37 less than the\ntotal sum of $1,007,009.37 claimed under the original bills.[note: 9]The explanation given by Wong P for\nthis unilateral deduction at the review hearing was that its earlier\nbills had not taken into account an “overlap” in work done between members\nof the same team handling the SMC’s matter. In any event, Woo J did\nnot deviate far from the Assistant Registrar’s earlier order, allowing Wong\nP to claim only a marginally higher sum of $370,000.[note: 10]",
        "Mr Sharma’s complaint to the\nLaw Society": "15     As\nstated earlier, Mr Sharma’s complaint against Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho\nwas made to the Law Society on 23 January 2014. It was accompanied\nby the written opinion of a Queen’s Counsel, Mr Ian Winter QC (“Mr\nWinter QC”), dated 8 December 2013. Mr Sharma stated that, prior\nto approaching Mr Winter QC for his opinion, he had contacted several\nlocal Senior Counsel (“SCs”) to act for him in respect of his complaint.[note: 11]However, these SCs and/or\ntheir law firms declined to act for him. He had therefore “no choice”\nbut to obtain the advice of a Queen’s Counsel in deciding whether\nto proceed with his complaint.[note: 12] 16     In\nhis written opinion, Mr Winter QC concluded that there was “due cause”\nto believe that Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho wereprima\nfacieguilty of professional misconduct because of the\ngrossly excessive fees which they had claimed.[note: 13]Interestingly,\nMr Winter QC’s opinion also stated, in the context of setting out\nthe factual background to the complaint, that Mr Sharma was a third\nparty “co-funder” of the proceedings between his wife and the SMC.[note: 14]I pause here to make the observation\nthat this statement gave the impression that it was intended to\naddress possible concerns over Mr Sharma’s ostensible lack of interest\nor standing to make the complaint because he was neither a party\nto the proceedings between his wife and the SMC, nor the party liable\nto pay the costs. In other words, the statement appeared to be a\ntacit acknowledgement by Mr Sharma – who must have conveyed his\ninvolvement as a co-funder to Mr Winter QC – that he had to establish\nsome form of interest, and in this case pecuniary, in the conduct complained\nof so as to make the complaint. 17     The\nRC was duly constituted under s 85(6) of the LPA to review the complaint\nand its decision was conveyed to Mr Sharma by way of a letter dated\n10 April 2014.[note: 15]In\nthis letter, the RC began by noting that Mr Sharma’s complaint against\nMr Yeo SC and Ms Ho could be understood as comprising two independent\nlimbs as follows:[note: 16] (a)     first,\nthat the sums claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were exorbitant and\ndemonstrative of a persistent conduct of gross overcharging as well\nas improper and/or fraudulent conduct that was opportunistic, arbitrary,\nunconscionable and unjustified (“Limb 1”); and (b)     second,\nthat the sums claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho were probably in excess\nof what was billed to, or could have been billed to the SMC and\nthat this amounted to misconduct (“Limb 2”). 18     The\nRC’s letter then went on to disclose its findings. Limb 1 of the complaint\nwas completely dismissed against both Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho. In this\nconnection, the RC stated that the mere fact that the bills of costs rendered\nhad been taxed down significantly did notper\nseconstitute professional misconduct “in the absence\nof other impropriety”.[note: 17]Further, the\nRC also rejected a specific allegation by Mr Sharma that the effective hourly\nrate claimed by Mr Yeo SC and Ms Ho was excessive. This was because,\nin the RC’s view, the sums claimed in the bills of costs reflected\nthe work of “all the solicitors involved”.[note: 18]As for Limb 2 of the complaint,\nit was only partially dismissed. The RC found that Mr Yeo SC was\n“not involved with the preparation of the Bills of Costs and the\nproceedings related thereto”; hence this head of complaint against\nhim was “lacking in substance”.[note: 19]However, in so\nfar as Ms Ho was concerned, the RC referred Limb 2 of the complaint\nagainst her for further inquiry by an Inquiry Committee under s\n85(8)(b) of the LPA.[note: 20]",
        "Mr Sharma’s application for\njudicial review": "19     After\nthe RC had conveyed its decision, Mr Sharma considered whether to\napply for a quashing order against it.[note: 21]He approached\nseveral local SCs to assist him in this connection but experienced\nthe same outcome as when he first sought legal assistance in respect\nof his earlier complaint to the Law Society – all the SCs who had\nbeen approached and/or their law firms declined to act for him or\nprovide him with a formal opinion. Therefore, Mr Sharma stated that\nhe was again left with “no choice” but to approach a Queen’s Counsel\nwho, on this occasion, turned out to be the Applicant.[note: 22] 20     The\nApplicant rendered Mr Sharma a written opinion dated 19 June 2014.[note: 23]It\nshould be pointed out here that the contents of this opinion are of\nsome significance because it sets out the Applicant’s views on the relevant\ngrounds for quashing the RC’s decision and thereby provides an insight\ninto theissueswhich he no doubt\nanticipated would arise if such a challenge was eventually brought.\nThis certainly had an important bearing on the present application,\nwhich will become clearer below. I further note that, much like\nMr Winter QC’s opinion before, the Applicant also sought to convey\nthat Mr Sharma had participated financially in his wife’s proceedingsvis-à-visthe SMC by stating that Mr Sharma\nwas “ultimately responsible” for paying Wong P’s costs.[note: 24]However, this statement is clearly\ninaccurate in so far as it suggests that Mr Sharma was in fact the partyliableto pay costs to the SMC. Certainly\nat no point was Mr Sharma made the subject of the relevant costs\norders. Nevertheless, this statement reinforced the impression that,\nin Mr Sharma’s own view,locus standihad to\nbe shown in order to make a complaint to the Law Society. 21     On\n26 June 2014, Mr Sharma proceeded to file Originating Summons No\n593 of 2014 (“OS 593/2014”). This was an application for leave to commence\njudicial review proceedings against the RC’s decision to wholly dismiss\nhis complaint against Mr Yeo SC and to partially dismiss his complaint\nagainst Ms Ho. Notably, the statement which accompanied this leave\napplication broadly recited the same grounds for judicial review which\nthe Applicant had framed in his earlier opinion.[note: 25]Indeed, this is confirmed by\nMr Sharma, who states in an affidavit filed in this application that\n“[m]y grounds for judicial review are in line with Mr Fordham Q.C.’s Analysis”.[note: 26]",
        "The present application for\nad hoc admission": "22     On\nthe same day, the present application was also filed for the Applicant\nto be admitted to practise as an advocate and solicitor on anad hocbasis. Such admission was sought\nfor the purpose of representing Mr Sharma (a) at the hearing of\nhis application for leave to apply for a quashing order (ie, OS 593/2014) and, if such leave is\ngranted, (b) at the substantive hearing for the quashing order,\nand (c) at any appeals or other further or related proceedings thereto.",
        "Mr Sharma’s standing to complain\nto the Law Society": "23     Before\nembarking on the analysis of whether the Applicant satisfies the\nrequirements in s 15 of the LPA, I wish to first deal with the rather peculiar\ncircumstances under which the complaint to the Law Society was made\n(see [4] above). 24     The\nquestion whether a complainant is required to establish standing when\nmaking a complaint against an advocate and solicitor has hitherto\nnot been considered in our courts. This is perhaps not entirely\nremarkable because to my knowledge, there has never been a complaint\nfiled by a “stranger” or more aptly\na “non-party” to the underlying\nproceedings such as Mr Sharma. In this limited sense, it is unprecedented. 25     The\nstanding of Mr Sharma to seek leave to apply for judicial review against\nthe decision of the RC is undoubtedly an issue for determination\nat the leave application. However, when I examined both Mr Sharma’s complaint\nto the Law Society as well as the application before me, my impression\nwas that Mr Sharma recognises that he has to establish his requisite\nstanding to do so. His purported standing was that he was the “co-funder”\nof his wife’s legal fees in her applications and appeals against\nthe procedural decisions of the SMC. However, no further information\nor basis was provided by Mr Sharma to establish that he was indeed\nthe co-funder. This curious omission should be examined in the context\nthat Dr Lim is herself a person of very substantial means and no\nexplanation has been provided as to why she needed co-funding and\nthat she was in fact co-funded by Mr Sharma. Further, it is also\npertinent to point out that even if Mr Sharma was the co-funder,\nwhich is capable of proof, the costs orders were nonetheless made\nagainst Dr Lim. Mr Sharma is therefore not liable to the SMC to\npay the costs irrespective of his private arrangement, if any, either\nwith his wife or her lawyers. It may be relevant and necessary to examine\nthe standing issue from this perspective. Otherwise, it may result in\na seemingly anomalous situation where Mr Sharma is able to lodge\na complaint against the lawyers about the fees claimed by the SMC\nwhile the lawyers acting on behalf of the SMC are unable to pursue\nthe costs orders against Mr Sharma. 26     With\nthese reservations in mind, I invited the parties to attend before me\nfor directions on the legal issues which I required assistance.\nAt this hearing, I directed all parties to specifically address\nme on thelocus standiissue given\nthe unique nature and circumstances of the leave application and\nthe underlying complaint. I informed the parties thatlocus standiis a relevant consideration\nfor the purposes of thead hocadmission\napplication only if I am able to come to a definite landing that\nMr Sharmaclearlyhas no standing\nto proceed with the leave application,ie,\nthat the leave application is a non-starter. In that limited event,\nit would serve no purpose to admit the Applicant to argue the underlying\nleave application. 27     It\nmay be useful to first set out the various positions adopted by\nthe parties on the standing issue and how some of their initial\npositions changed in the course of the proceedings: (a)     The\nRC implicitly acknowledged the requirement to demonstrate standing\nwhen it noted in its decision of 10 April 2014 that “whilst you\n[ie, Mr Sharma] were neither a client\nnor a party to the proceedings against Dr Susan Lim, you were funding\nthe legal expenses and the information furnished by you were legitimately\nthe subject matter of a complaint”.[note: 27] (b)     Counsel\nfor the Applicant, Mr Abraham Vergis (“Mr Vergis”), initially intimated\nto me at the directions hearing that Mr Sharma is indeed required\nto demonstrate standing. However, upon further reflection, Mr Vergis\nadopted a different position at the hearing for oral submissions.\nHe argued forcefully that there is no requirement for a complainant\nto demonstrate standing. (c)     The\nAttorney-General maintained a consistent position throughout that\nstanding is necessary and that Mr Sharma does not satisfy the requirement. (d)     The\nLaw Society’s position is somewhat interesting. Initially, it adopted\nthe position that there is no strict requirement to demonstrate\nany particular standing and thatany personcould\nlodge a complaint against an advocate and solicitor. However, in\nthe course of his oral submissions, probably recognising the potential\nfloodgate of frivolous complaints, counsel for the Law Society,\nMr Christopher Anand Daniel (“Mr Daniel”), sought to hedge his position\nonlocus standiby proposing a hybrid\nposition. He submitted that in respect of complaints where there\nis a victim, only the victim should be able to file the complaint.\nIn respect of alleged professional misconduct where there is no\ndirect victim, the complaint against such conduct can be lodged\nbyany person. In this case, Mr\nDaniel’s tentative submission is that since there is a “victim”,\nonly that “victim”,ie, Dr Lim,\ncould lodge the complaint regarding the costs claimed against her. 28     Having\nheard detailed submissions from all parties on thelocus\nstandiissue, I have arrived at the view that it is neither\nplain nor obvious at this stage whether Mr Sharma is required to\ndemonstrate his standing and, if so, whether he has the standing\nto lodge the complaint or to file the leave application. Parties,\nin particular, the Law Society, are still in the process of settling\ntheir respective positions on the standing issue. This is understandable\nfrom the Law Society’s perspective given the wide-reaching implications\non the legal profession. As I am strictly not required to decide this\nissue definitively in the context of thead\nhocadmission application, it is preferable and more\nappropriate for the issue to be fully explored and determined at\nthe hearing of the leave application. For the immediate purpose\nof this application, I am satisfied that the standing issue shouldnotstand in the way of my consideration\nof its merits. Nonetheless, I will make some preliminary observations\non the submissions made by the parties. 29     The\nstarting reference should be the statutory regime under the LPA. Section\n85 of the LPA provides,inter alia,\nas follows: Complaints\nagainst advocates and solicitors 85.—(1)Any\ncomplaintof the conduct of an advocate and solicitor\n— (a)    shall be made to the Society\nin writing; (b)    shall\ninclude a statement by the complainant — (i)    as\nto whether, to his knowledge, any other complaint has been made\nto the Society against the advocate and solicitor, by him or by\nany other person, which arises from the same facts as his complaint;\nand (ii)   if so, setting out such particulars\nof each such complaint as the Council may require and he is able\nto provide; and (c)    shall be supported by\nsuch statutory declaration as the Council may require, except that\nno statutory declaration shall be required if the complaint is made\nby any public officer or any officer of the Institute. (1A)  Subject\nto subsection (4A), the Council [ie,\nthe Council of the Law Society] shall refer every complaint which\nsatisfies the requirements of subsection (1) to the Chairman of\nthe Inquiry Panel. (2)The Councilmay\non its own motion refer any information touching upon the conduct\nof an advocate and solicitor to the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel. (3)Any Judge of\nthe Supreme Court,the Attorney-Generalorthe Institute[ie,\nthe Singapore Institute of Legal Education] may at any time refer\nto the Society any information touching upon the conduct of an advocate\nand solicitor and the Council shall — (a)    refer the matter to the\nChairman of the Inquiry Panel … [emphasis added] 30     What\ns 85(1) of the LPA makes clear is themannerin\nwhich a complaint should be made to the Law Society – the complaint\nmust be in writing, accompanied by a statement as to whether there\nare any other complaints arising from the same facts against the\nsame lawyer, and supported by a statutory declaration. What is not\nentirely clear, however, iswhocan\nmake such complaint. 31     The\nquestion posed above may be answered in one of two possible ways.\nOn one view, any member of the public can make a complaint regardless\nof his interest in or connection to the conduct of the allegedly errant\nlawyer. This appears to be supported by the wording of s 85(1) of\nthe LPA, given its use of the rather open-ended term “[a]ny complaint”\nto invite complaints by any person and that, under s 85(1A), the\nCouncil of the Law Society is required to refer “every complaint”\nto the Chairman of the Inquiry Panel so long as the requirements\nunder s 85(1) are satisfied. The second and more circumscribed view,\nhowever, is that only those persons who are able to demonstrate\nsufficient interest in making a complaint can properly do so because,\notherwise, the Law Society may become inundated with frivolous complaints\nby persons with no interest other than being busybodies. From a\npolicy standpoint, such a scenario may appear undesirable since\nit causes the limited resources of the Law Society to be unduly\nstretched which, in turn, may delay the prosecution of more meritorious\ncomplaints. 32     Mr\nVergis squarely addressed the floodgates concern by inviting the court\nto examine the checks and balances inherent in the existing statutory regime\nunder the LPA. First, he identified the need to file a statutory declaration\nto accompany the complaint under s 85(1)(c).\nThis requirement was introduced in 2008 pursuant to the Legal Profession\n(Amendment) Act 2008 (Act 19 of 2008) with a view to emphasise the\nseriousness of complaints against lawyers and that complainants\nshould take steps to ensure the accuracy of their complaints. Second,\nthe RC itself functions as a filter. Third, the Inquiry Committee\nis empowered under s 85(18) to order the complainant to deposit\na sum not exceeding $1,000. Fourth, the Inquiry Committee can order\nthe complainant to pay costs under s 85(19)(a)\nif the complaint is found to be frivolous or vexatious. Finally,\na party making a knowingly false complaint shall be guilty of an\noffence under s 85(21) and be liable to a fine not exceeding $5,000.\nThese provisions do provide some measure of restraint against frivolous\ncomplaints. However, given the limited impact of these measures,\nthey may not effectively operate as a sufficient safeguard against\ncomplaints filed by persons who are either not directly aggrieved\nby the alleged professional misconduct of the lawyer or who do not\notherwise satisfy the requisite standing. It may be apposite to bear\nin mind the remarks of the Minister for Law that the sufficiency\nof the existing checks and balances identified by Mr Vergis “should\nbe considered against the impact of disciplinary proceedings on\nthe lawyer’s reputation and livelihood” (seeSingapore\nParliamentary Debates, Official Report(26 August 2008)\nvol 84 at cols 3240–3242 (K Shanmugam, Minister for Law)). Though\nhis remarks were made when introducing the amendment to require\nthe filing of a statutory declaration to accompany a complaint against\na lawyer, they are, in my view, equally apt for present purposes. 33     Further,\nI observe that if Mr Vergis is right that any person could file\na complaint under s 85(1), why then is there any need for sub-ss\n85(2) and (3), which empower specific public institutions and office-holders\nto refer information touching upon the conduct of an advocate and\nsolicitor to the Law Society? Such public institutions and office-holders\nhave an inherent interest in making such referrals when the occasion\narises. Seen in this light, it would appear odd if s 85(1) is then\nregarded as conferringcarte blancheon\nany person to make a complaint even though he may have no direct interest\nin doing so. In other words, the juxtaposition of s 85(1) with sub-ss (2)\nand (3) tends towards the conclusion that it was unlikely that s\n85(1) was intended to be of such an unqualified nature. Mr Vergis\nexplained that sub-ss 85(2) and (3) speak of “any information” to\nthe Law Society while s 85(1) refers to “[a]ny complaint”. It is\nnot entirely clear to me whether the difference lies in form rather\nthan substance since both would oblige the Law Society to look into\nthem. 34     For\nthe reasons that follow, I am able to decide on the merits of this application\nwithout having to reach a landing on thelocus\nstandiissue, however interesting and challenging it\nmay be. Having said that, as I will elaborate at [57] and [84] below,\nit is ultimately a question of statutory interpretation of thelocalscheme for the filing and processing\nof complaints under the LPA.",
        "The analytical framework forad hocadmissions": "",
        "The present statutory framework": "35     The\npresent statutory framework forad hocadmissions\nis a result of the recent round of amendments to the LPA by the\nLegal Profession (Amendment) Act 2012 (Act 3 of 2012) (“the 2012\nAmendment”) that took effect from 1 April 2012. This framework comprises\nss 15(1), 15(2) and 15(6A) of the LPA, which are reproduced here\nfor ease of reference: Ad\nhoc admissions 15.—(1) Notwithstanding anything\nto the contrary in this Act, the court may, for the purpose of any\none case, admit to practise as an advocate and solicitor any person\nwho — (a)    holds — (i)    Her\nMajesty’s Patent as Queen’s Counsel; or (ii)   any appointment of equivalent distinction\nof any jurisdiction; (b)    does not ordinarily reside\nin Singapore or Malaysia, but has come or intends to come to Singapore\nfor the purpose of appearing in the case; and (c)    has\nspecial qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case. (2)    The\ncourt shall not admit a person under this section in any case involving\nany area of legal practice prescribed under section 10 for the purposes\nof this subsection, unless the court is satisfied that there is\na special reason to do so. … (6A)  The\nChief Justice may, after consulting the Judges of the Supreme Court,\nby notification published in theGazette,\nspecify the matters that the court may consider when deciding whether\nto admit a person under this section. … 36     These\nprovisions in the LPA must be read together with two further pieces\nof subsidiary legislation to complete the picture on our current statutory\nscheme forad hocadmissions. The\nfirst is the Legal Profession (Admission) Rules 2011 (S 244/2011)\n(“the Admission Rules”), which lists out the areas of legal practice\nreferred to in s 15(2) of the LPA above. As provided in r 32(1)\nof the Admission Rules, there are three such “ring-fenced” areas\nof legal practice – constitutional and administrative law, criminal\nlaw, and family law – in respect of which a “special reason” must be\nshown to exist. The second piece of subsidiary legislation is the\nLegal Profession (Ad Hoc Admissions) Notification 2012 (S 132/2012)\n(“the Notification”), which was issued by Chan Sek Keong CJ pursuant\nto s 15(6A) of the LPA. Paragraph 3 of the Notification sets out\nthe following matters which the court may consider for the purpose\nof deciding whether to admit a foreign senior counsel in a particular\ncase – (a) the nature of the factual and legal issues involved in\nthe case; (b) the necessity for the services of a foreign senior\ncounsel; (c) the availability of any local SC or other advocate\nand solicitor with appropriate experience; and (d) whether, having regard\nto the circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit a foreign senior\ncounsel for the purpose of the case. 37     Since\nthe current statutory framework forad hocadmissions\ncame into effect, there have been five reported cases which are,\nin chronological order, as follows:Re Andrews\nGeraldine Mary QC[2013] 1 SLR 872 (“Re Geraldine\nAndrews”),Re Caplan Jonathan Michael\nQC[2013] 3 SLR 66 (“Re Caplan”),Re Lord Goldsmith Peter Henry PC QC[2013]\n4 SLR 921 (“Re Lord Goldsmith”),Re Beloff Michael Jacob QC[2013] 4 SLR\n849 (“Re Beloff (HC)”) andRe Beloff Michael Jacob QC[2014] 3 SLR\n424 (“Re Beloff (CA)”). The first\nfour cases in this quintet were decisions of the High Court while the\nfifth was handed down by the Court of Appeal. These cases have been highlighted\nright at the outset here because, collectively, they contain much useful\ndiscussion on the applicable principles forad\nhocadmissions under the current statutory framework,\nthus regular references will be made to them in the course of this\njudgment. The most recent decision ofRe Beloff (CA),\nin particular, will be turned to shortly as it has helpfully set\nout the appropriate analytical framework for approachingad hocadmission applications. Before\nproceeding to do so, however, I digress briefly to outline how the\ncurrent statutory regime forad hocadmissions\nin s 15 of the LPA has evolved from its immediate predecessor, which\nwas contained in s 21 of the Legal Profession Act (Cap 161, 1990\nRev Ed) (“the 1990 Act”) and retained in its successor versions\nuntil 1 April 2012 (seeRe Geraldine Andrewsat\n[28]). The purpose of this exercise is to illustrate how the current\nstatutory framework has fundamentally shifted the analytical focus from\nthat which prevailed under the 1990 Act and, as a consequence, cases which\nwere decided under the latter statutory regime should be approached with\na degree of caution in today’s context.",
        "The relevance of earlier cases": "38Re Geraldine Andrewswas the first case\nto be decided under the current statutory framework and, fittingly,\nV K Rajah JA took the opportunity (at [21]–[28]) to chart how the\nstatutory regime forad hocadmissions\nin Singapore had evolved over the last half a century since its inception\nin 1962 as s 7A of the Advocates and Solicitors Ordinance (Cap 188,\n1955 Rev Ed). I do not intend to repeat the detailed excursus undertaken\nby Rajah JA here. For present purposes, it suffices to note that the\nposition before the 2012 Amendment was a result of the Legal Profession\n(Amendment) Act 1991 (Act 10 of 1991) (“the 1991 Amendment”). 39     Prior\nto the 1991 Amendment, there was a “fairly relaxed approach which\nsaw most [ad hocadmission] applications\nsucceeding” (seeRe Beloff (HC)at\n[14]) because the primary consideration at the time was simply whether\nthe foreign senior counsel had special qualifications or experience for\nthe purpose of the case. It was common practice for parties then\nnot to object to such applications; hence the court was seldom required\nto exercise its discretion against admission (seeRe\nGeraldine Andrewsat [34], citingRe Oliver\nDavid KeightleyRideal QC[1992]\n1 SLR(R) 961 at [8]). It is therefore unsurprising that the statutory\nregime prior to the 1991 Amendment did not generate much case law.\nIndeed, as Rajah JA had noted inRe Geraldine Andrewsat\n[34], over the span of 20 years from 1970 to 1990, there was only one\nreported decision on thead hocadmission\nof foreign senior counsel which, in any event, was conspicuously\nbrief on its discussion of the statutory framework existing then. 40     The\n1991 Amendment, however, brought about a sweeping change. It caused\nthe law to be “moved to an extremely restricted approach” (seeRe Beloff (HC)at [14]) and this gradually\nsaw a considerable body of jurisprudence being built up on the subject.\nThese cases had to interpret s 21 of the 1990 Act which, as has\nbeen mentioned, was the direct precursor to the current statutory\nframework in s 15 of the LPA. Section 21 of the 1990 Act read as\nfollows: 21.—(1)\nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Act, the court\nmay, for the purpose of any one casewhere\nthe court is satisfied that it is of sufficient difficulty and complexityand\nhaving regard to the circumstances of the case, admit to practise\nas an advocate and solicitor any person who — (a)    holds Her Majesty’s Patent\nas Queen’s Counsel; (b)    does\nnot ordinarily reside in Singapore or Malaysia but who has come\nor intends to come to Singapore for the purpose of appearing in the\ncase; and (c)    has\nspecial qualifications or experience for the purpose of the case. … [emphasis added] 41     The\nnewly introduced requirement of “sufficient difficulty and complexity”\nreceived close treatment by the courts and, as Rajah JA noted inRe Geraldine Andrewsat [33], it would\nbecome “notoriously difficult to satisfy”. This had important practical\nimplications because, although the courts had formulated a three-stage\ntest for approachingad hocadmission applications\nunder s 21 of the 1990 Act, the “sufficient difficulty and complexity”\nrequirement was not merely one of several factors which the court\nweighed in “having regard to the circumstances of the case”. Instead, it\nwas effectively treated in practice as athresholdrequirement\nso that, unless the issues raised in the case for which admission\nwas sought were assessed as being sufficiently difficult or complex,\nthe application would not be acceded to (seeRe\nGeraldine Andrewsat [34]). 42     The\nabove approach, as may readily be observed, is very different from\nwhat is contemplated by our current statutory framework. Under the current\nframework, the court is directed to consider thetotalityof\nthe circumstances surrounding the application, having particular\nregard to the four factors listed in the Notification. While the\ncomplexity of the underlying case will no doubt still have a bearing\non the court’s final determination, it is by no means a decisive\nfactor which trumps all other considerations. In this connection,\nI note that the Court of Appeal has pertinently observed that, in\nthe light of the 2012 Amendment, the suitability ofad\nhocadmissions is now to be viewed through the prism\nof “need” (seeRe Beloff (CA)at\n[42]). This fundamentally shifts the entire statutory emphasis away\nfrom the “difficulty and complexity” of a case and so, even though\nthere may be some common elements between the statutory regime under\nthe 1990 Act and the current LPA, one must exercise caution in drawing\non principles espoused under the former for the purpose of interpreting\nthe latter. Rajah JA made this point clearly at [64] and [65] ofRe Geraldine Andrews: … [T]he intent of the 2012 Amendment is\nto give the courts greater discretion in dealing with applications\nfor thead hocadmission of foreign senior\ncounsel by removing the threshold requirement that the issues in\nthe case must be of “sufficient difficulty and complexity” and by\neasing the admission requirements for appropriate matters. …It is no longer necessary to show that the issues\nin the case are of “sufficient difficulty and complexity”.Conversely,\neven if the issues are of sufficient difficulty and complexity,\nit will not necessarily follow that the application for the ad hoc\nadmission of foreign senior counsel will be granted.The focus has now shifted from the difficulty and\ncomplexity of the issues in the underlying case to all the matters\nstated in para 3 of the Notification.Difficult and complex\nissues may well be competently put forward and argued by local counsel\nwho are available and who have the appropriate expertise. The above examination of the historical\nevolution of thead hocadmission scheme\namply illustrates how the present scheme hasradically\nmodifiedthe earlier criteria for admission. Of particular\nrelevance is the decision by Parliament to devolve to the Chief\nJustice the discretion to set out the matters to be considered by\nthe courts in deciding each and every application forad hocadmission.The\nfour matters specified in para 3 of the Notification are now the\ntouchstone for the courts in assessing applications for ad hoc admission.Previous cases on ad hoc admission are now only\nof limited relevance.The effect\nof this sea change has not been properly appreciated by counsel opposing\nthe present application, who appear to be still unduly wedded to case\nlaw based on the previous ad hoc admission scheme. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 43     This\nunderlines the point that, although a wider compass of cases than\nwhat I have identified at [37] above have dealt withad hocadmissions, these cases of an earlier\nvintage may not necessarily point one in the right direction. The\ndiscussions contained in these cases certainly cannot be divorced\nfrom the statutory context prevailing at that time which, it is\nclear, has since been radically departed from.",
        "The present analytical framework": "44     As\nmentioned earlier, the Court of Appeal inRe\nBeloff (CA)has recently set out the analytical framework\nfor assessingad hocadmission applications\nunder s 15 of the LPA. This is neatly summed up at [54] of the judgment: The architecture of the regime may thus\nbe summarised in terms thatit requires the\ncourt first to apply its mind to certain mandatory requirements. These\nare: (a)    the\nformal requirements in ss 15(1)(a)\nand 15(1)(b); (b)    the requirement that the foreign counsel\nhas special qualifications and experience for the purpose of the\ncase; and (c)    the threshold inquiry of whether a\nspecial reason must be shown and if so, whether it has been. We consider these requirements mandatory\nbecause if any of these are not met, the application for admission\nmust fail and the question of discretion does not arise.It is only if these matters are all met that the\ncourt must then consider the further matters specified in the Notification,\nand then exercise its discretion having regard to all the circumstances. [original emphasis omitted; emphasis added\nin italics] 45     The\npassage above makes clear that the court’s starting point is centred\non the mandatory requirements in ss 15(1)(a)–(c) and 15(2) of the LPA. If any of these\nrequirements are not satisfied, then it is unnecessary to consider\nthe Notification factors. If, however, the analysis does reach the Notification\nfactors, then it should be added that there is no particular precedence\namong the four enumerated factors nor do they set out a new rigid\nfour-stage test (seeRe Geraldine Andrewsat\n[45]). Instead, these factors are in the nature of “signposts” which\ndirect the court towards “the ultimate question” set out in the\nfourth Notification factor, namely, whether having regard to all\nthe circumstances of the case, it is reasonable to admit the foreign\nsenior counsel (seeRe Beloff (CA)at\n[53]). With this framework in mind, I turn now to consider the first\nset of mandatory requirements in s 15(1) of the LPA, in particular,\ns 15(1)(c).",
        "Whether the Applicant has “special\nqualifications or experience for the purpose of the case”": "46     There\nwas no dispute that the Applicant satisfied the formal mandatory\nrequirements in ss 15(1)(a) and\n(b) of the LPA. He has held letters\npatent as Queen’s Counsel since 2006 and is not ordinarily resident in\nSingapore or Malaysia but intends to come to Singapore to represent\nMr Sharma in OS 593/2014 and further and/or related proceedings\nshould this application be allowed. An issue was raised, however,\nas to whether or not the Applicant satisfied the further mandatory\nrequirement in s 15(1)(c). In particular,\nthe emphasis was on whether he had special qualifications or experiencefor the purpose of the case.",
        "The parties’ arguments": "71     The\nmain thrust of Mr Vergis’ case was that Mr Sharma had taken conscientious\nsteps to contact no less than 20 local SCs to assist him in either\nhis complaint to the Law Society or his judicial review application.[note: 38]However, all\nof these SCs who were approached declined to render Mr Sharma an\nopinion, much less represent him for various reasons including possible\nconflict of interest. In Mr Vergis’ submission, the practical realities of\nthis case could not be ignored as an important factor which contributed to\nthe lukewarm responses received by Mr Sharma. Mr Yeo SC, it was stressed,\nis not only a prominent member of the legal fraternity but also\nof the wider public community. He is a Member of Parliament, a very\nsenior local SC, and a leading figure in one of the largest law\nfirms in Singapore (ie, Wong P);\nhence, he and his firm would have close professional and personal\nrelationships with many of the leading lawyers and law practices\nin Singapore.[note: 39]Mr\nVergis also added that it was necessary for Mr Sharma to have skilled\nrepresentation by a local SC (or foreign equivalent) in this case because\nthe three grounds on which judicial review were sought raised “serious\nmatters”, although this was not elaborated upon in his written submissions.[note: 40]Further, he\nemphasised that this was the first time that a decision of the RC\nwas being subjected to judicial review, thus the question of whether\nthe RC’s decisions were even reviewable was a novel one. 72     Both\nthe Attorney-General and the Law Society proceeded on broadly the\nsame footing that representation by a local SC or a foreign senior counsel\nwasnot necessary. In response to\nMr Vergis’ argument on the reviewability of the RC’s decision, the\nLaw Society’s position was that this did not raise a novel point\nof law because, for the same reasons as enumerated at [58] above,\nthe legislature has already evinced an intention to exclude the\nRC’s decisions from judicial review.[note: 41]The\nAttorney-General’s submission on this point was that the novelty\nof an issue in itself does not translate into theneedfor\nrepresentation by only a select pool of local SCs or foreign senior\ncounsel.[note: 42]The complexity\nand difficulty of the issues involved also had to be weighed in\nthe balance. In this respect, both the Attorney-General and the\nLaw Society submitted that there was nothing to suggest that the\nissues raised by the judicial review proceedings were so complex\nor difficult thatotherlocal counsel\n(ie, non-SCs) would not be able to\neffectively represent Mr Sharma. Therefore, Mr Sharma could not\ncite the lack of availability of local SCs as a “special reason”\nforad hocadmission when there\nwas no basis for him to have restricted his search toonlylocal SCs to begin with. There was\na wider pool of competent local counsel from whom he could have\nsought assistance but, as it turned out, omitted to consider entirely.\nMoreover, there was also no explanation why Mr Vergis himself could\nnot adequately represent Mr Sharma in his judicial review application\ngiven the competence which he displayed in the conduct of this application.",
        "Analysis": "Two preliminary observations 73     I\nmake two preliminary points regarding the parties’ submissions. 74     First,\nit may readily be noticed that Mr Vergis’ submission essentially populates\nthe “special reason” requirement with several of the Notification factors.\nThe lack of availability of local counsel, nature of the underlying issues,\nand necessity for representation by foreign senior counsel are all factors\nwhich have been specifically enumerated in para 3 of the Notification\n(see [36] above). However, in the light of the Court of Appeal’s observation\ninRe Beloff (CA)that the inquiry\ninto “special reason” is sequentially prior to and distinct from\na consideration of the Notification factors, one might pause to\nquery whether merging the analysis in this way is permissible. In\nmy view, there is nothing objectionableper\nsewith such an approach. As has already been pointed\nout, the Court of Appeal has impressed the importance of recognising\nthat the different parts of thead hocadmission\nframework are necessarily linked and not standalone requirements.\nTherefore, one can ordinarily expect “some degree of overlap” between\nthe Notification factors and the “special reason” requirement (seeRe Caplanat [49]). Indeed, I add that\nit would be unsound to insist on a “special reason” which is invariably\ndifferent from the factors found in the Notification because that\nis akin to defining the “special reason”by\nexclusion. 75     Second,\nit is also apparent that the crux of the parties’ dispute concerns\nthe relevant pool of local counsel which Mr Sharma could reasonably\nhave been expected to approach. Should he have approached only localSCsor was this too exclusive a pool?\nThe answer to this question cannot be answered in a vacuum. This\nis because the pool of competent local counsel necessarily turns\non a prior evaluation of the nature of the issues. The more the\nissues are complex or difficult, or novel, or of significant precedential\nvalue, “the smaller might be the pool of local advocates able and\navailable to deal with the case at hand and the greater might be\nthe need for the admission of foreign counsel” (seeRe\nBeloff (CA)at [61]). With this in mind, I shall first\nconsider Mr Vergis’ submission on the nature of the issues raised\nin the underlying proceedings. The nature of the issues 76     As\nearlier noted in the context of discussing s 15(1)(c)\nof the LPA, the central issues potentially arising in the underlying\njudicial review proceedings are entwined with the three grounds\non which the RC’s decision is sought to be quashed (see [51] above).\nQuite apart from the fact that these issues are local-centric in\nnature, I also find that there is nothing particularly difficult\nor complex about them. However, before proceeding to illustrate\nhow I came to this view, I pause to emphasise that I should not be\nmistaken as attributing determinative weight to or even prioritising\nthe relative complexity or difficulty of a case in every application\nforad hocadmission. Such an approach\nharkens back to the position prior to the 2012 Amendment and that\nwould be most unfortunate given how the jurisprudence has since\nthen wisely recognised the new emphasis under the current framework\n(see [42]–[43] above) and, consequently, developed along its own\npath. I stress that the complexity and difficulty of the underlying\nissues haveonlybeen accorded the\nattention which it has here because it is Mr Sharma’s case that\na “special reason” exists on account of the lack of availability\nof local counsel to assist him in his judicial review application\nand that, as I have said in the preceding paragraph, is an inquiry that\nis inextricably dependent on the nature of the issues. Put simply,\nthe “special reason” cited in support for this application has the\neffect of driving the analysis unavoidably towards an examination\nof the nature of the issues. The following observations which I\nmake on the complexity and difficulty of the issues must therefore\nbe understood with this important caveat in mind. 77     The\nfirst of the proposed grounds for review rests solely on the proposition\nthat objectively gross overcharging can constitute professional misconduct\nin and of itself. However, I do not see how it will require any intricate\nor sophisticated submissions to establish this. During the hearing, I\nquizzed Mr Vergis on the legal foundation for this proposition and\nhe was able to immediately direct me to the decision inSusan Limwhere the court had stated,\nin the context of considering a lawyer’s ethical duties at [51], that\n“the presence of … additional factors is unnecessary, and … overcharging\ncan – in and of itself – constitute professional misconduct”. To\nbe clear, I am not saying that the RC’s decision should be quashed\nin the light of this authority. The point which I am merely making\nis that the legal proposition sought to be established does not\nappear to be a particularly controversial one which, for example,\nhas to be extracted from a long line of (perhaps conflicting) authorities.\nFurther, Mr Vergis has demonstrated that he is well-acquainted with\nthis proposition and more than capable of advancing it in the judicial\nreview proceedings. 78     The\nsecond ground for review also raises the rather straightforward issue\nof whether the RC was correct to take into account the work of all\nthe solicitors involved when no certificate for more than two solicitors\nhad been obtained by Wong P. It should be stressed that there are\nno factual disputes here. It is clear from the face of each of the\nthree bills which were rendered that, indeed, no certificate for\nmore than two solicitors had been issued. The only issue raised\nby this ground is one of law – was the RC correct to take into account\nthe work ofallthe solicitors involved notwithstanding\nthe procedural rule in O 59 r 19? Again, I fail to see how the resolution\nof this issue can attract much difficulty. It ostensibly turns on the\napplication of a particular provision of the Rules of Court, and\nthat is precisely the kind of question which arises in our courts\nevery day. 79     The\nthird ground engages the legal issue of whether the RC had fundamentally\nmisunderstood its own role in finding that Mr Yeo SC was not involved\nin the matters complained of. As I had stated earlier at [55], the\narguments made pursuant to this ground will necessarily revolve around\nthe relevant provisions in the LPA which set out the entire scheme for\ndisciplinary proceedings against lawyers. This will primarily involve\nan exercise in statutory interpretation to ascertain the true role\nof the RC and, once more, I am not convinced that it will either\nbe complex or difficult to undertake. 80     Viewed\nin this way, it is not apparent how the three grounds for review\nwould raise any “serious matters” as stated in Mr Vergis’ written submissions.\nHowever, I note that, during the hearing, Mr Vergis did submit that\nan importantthresholdlegal issue\nwas raised by the three grounds collectively. The context in which\nthis submission was made is important. It bears mention that this\nwas not a point raised in either Mr Vergis’ written submissions\nor in the Applicant’s opinion. Instead, it arose out of a preliminary\nobservation made in the Attorney-General’s written submissions to\nthe effect that Mr Sharma’s application for judicial review was,\nfor all intents and purposes, anappealagainst\nthe RC’s decision.[note: 43]In this\nregard, the Attorney-General had pointed out that none of the three grounds\nraised by Mr Sharma were based on the traditionally recognised grounds\nfor seeking judicial review,viz,\nirrationality, illegality, or procedural impropriety. Rather, the\nthree grounds were all premised on allegederrors\nof lawcommitted by the RC and these were properly the grounds\nfor an appeal. The Attorney-General therefore concluded that the judicial\nreview application was “fundamentally misconceived” and “doomed\nto fail”.[note: 44]It was\nin response to this threshold argument that Mr Vergis then cited\nthe House of Lords’ decision inAnisminic Ltd\nv Foreign Compensation Commission and another[1969]\n2 AC 147 (“Anisminic”) at the hearing.\nAccording to Mr Vergis,Anisminicstood\nfor the proposition that a tribunal’s errors or misdirection of\nlawcanindeed form the basis for judicial\nreview; hence, the threshold question of whether or not errors of law\nwere even reviewable in Singapore was not as straightforward as\nthe Attorney-General had suggested. 81     The\naccount which has just been provided illustrates how the threshold\nquestion arose rather organically during the course of the hearing.\nIt was certainly not advanced as the main trunk of or even an incidental\nbranch to Mr Vergis’ submissions on the nature of the issues which\nwould potentially arise in the judicial review proceedings. Indeed,\nit was not even identified by Mr Vergis or the Applicant as an issue\nto begin with. Given this background context, it was unsurprising\nthat, apart from citing the decision inAnisminic,\nMr Vergis did not really develop his argument much further on how\nthe threshold issue was one that wascomplex\nor difficult. All he could say in this connection was\nthat the fact that the Attorney-General took a diametrically opposed\nposition on such a fundamental point of administrative law lent\nweight to his view that this was a difficult issue with potentially\nwide-reaching implications. However, I do not think that such a\ngeneral assertion takes Mr Vergis very far. The fact that parties\nmay adopt clashing views on certain issues is merely a product of\nour adversarial process and it does not inevitably lead to the conclusion that\nthose disputed issues are difficult or complex. Furthermore, I should point\nout that, in any event, Mr Daniel was able to direct me to several\nlocal authorities during the course of his oral submissions which\nappear to have consideredAnisminic.\nIn the light of this, it is difficult to see why local counsel will\nnot be able to make submissions on the threshold issue competently. 82     Finally,\nI address the two remaining issues which will arise at the leave stage,viz, thelocus standiof\nMr Sharma to commence judicial review proceedings and the reviewability\nof the RC’s decision. Both these issues are, in a sense, novel.\nThe question of whether a complainant to the Law Society is required\nto establishlocus standihas not\nbeen considered before and this is also the first time that judicial\nreview has been sought against an RC’s decision. Mr Vergis therefore\nsays that the resolution of these issues will be of some moment\nand so the court which has to decide on these important matters\nwould certainly benefit from the expert presentation by skilled\ncounsel. 83     I\nam not persuaded by Mr Vergis’ argument. While the novelty of the underlying\nissues is no doubt a relevant factor to consider, it is simply a\npart of the court’s overall assessment of the nature of the issues\ninvolved. This is illustrated by the approach taken inRe Lord Goldsmith. There, Rajah JA also\nrecognised at [64] that the issue in respect of which the applicant soughtad hocadmission was a novel one – it\nwas the first time that the constitutionality of s 377A of the Penal\nCode (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed) was being challenged in the Court of\nAppeal. In fact, Rajah JA further noted that there was “an additional\nelement of novelty” because that was one of the few occasions where\nthe court was being invited to examine the legitimacy of Parliament’s\nobjective in enacting s 377A. However, the application to admit\nLord Peter Goldsmith QC was dismissed because, ultimately, the issues\nwere not “of such a peculiarly complex nature that they present[ed]\na case which [was] out of the ordinary from a legal perspective”\n(at [64]). 84     In\nmy view, there is also nothing “peculiarly complex” or “out of the ordinary”\nabout either thelocus standiissue\nor the reviewability issue here. This is because the resolution\nof both issues involves no more than the proper interpretation to\nbe placed on the relevant provisions in the LPA pertaining, in particular,\nto the complaints regime in s 85 and the disciplinary proceedings\nregime in Part VII. In other words, stripped down to its core, the\ntwo issues are essentially issues of statutory interpretation of the\nrelevantlocallegislation. They\nmight not admit of an easy answer because of the varying possible\ninterpretations that the respective statutory regimes can bear;\nhowever, that is not to say that counsel will necessarily find it\ndifficult or complex to formulate and advance their respective interpretations\nin this connection. I would also add that, in terms of novelty,\ncomplexity and difficulty, one can easily appreciate at a glance\nthat the issues arising in the underlying judicial review proceedings\nhere certainly pale in comparison to those which were being considered\ninRe Lord Goldsmith. I am not saying\nthat the present issues are trifling in nature but, as a matter\nof relativity, there is plainly no doubt that a decision on whether\nor not s 377A of the Penal Code is constitutional has far wider societal\nand legal implications for Singapore than what concerns us here. Seen\nfrom this perspective, it would be odd if the present application\nforad hocadmission nevertheless\nsucceeded merely because of the novelty of the underlying issues\nwhen the application inRe Lord Goldsmithdid\nnot. 85     There\nis one final point which, in my view, cannot be ignored in the context\nof considering whether it isnecessaryto\nadmit foreign senior counsel on account of the nature of the issues.\nThis point also emerges fromRe Lord Goldsmith.\nThere, Rajah JA had perceptively noted that the applicant was seekingad hocadmission to argue anappealin the Court of Appeal. In the\nlearned judge’s assessment, appellate advocacy in Singapore had\nbecome more “writing-centred” than\nin many other common law court systems (at [29]) and he explained\nthe impact which this had on the necessity forad\nhocadmission as follows (at [37]): The writing process therefore serves both\na creative function in generating and marshalling ideas, and a critical\nfunction that allows counsel to identify ambiguities and inconsistencies\nin their own cases as well as those in the opposing side.There is nothing to prevent the participation of\nforeign senior counsel in the preparation of the written submissions,\nthe writing of further submissions (if any), and the preparation\nof the oral case (in anticipating and preparing for questions).Because\nof the wider scope for the involvement of the expertise of a foreign\nsenior counsel in appeal cases, there may thus beless\nnecessityin appeals, notwithstanding the importance\nof the issues engaged, to have foreign senior counsel admitted toorallypresent the Case.It is\nstrong written advocacy that usually has determinative consequences.… [emphasis in original in italics; emphasis\nadded in bold italics] 86     In\nmy judgment, Rajah JA’s observations are highly instructive for\nthe present case. Although the Applicant here does not seek admission\nto argue an appeal, the underlying judicial review proceedings are\nnevertheless akin to one since they are devoid of any disputes of\nfact and are centred entirely on issues of law. Unlike a trial,\nthere will be no cross-examination of witnesses, no forensic examination\nof bundles of documentary evidence, and certainly no necessity to\nmake “irreversible strategic decisions in the context of a dynamic\nprocess” (see [Re Lord Goldsmithat\n[25]). In these circumstances, it is difficult to see why there\nis a need for Mr Sharma to be represented by foreign senior counsel.\nThe Applicant can provide substantial input in crafting and drafting\nthe written submissions and these arguments can then be ventilated\norally in court by competent local counsel. Mr Sharma may wellpreferto have the Applicant argue his\ncase as well, but that is quite beside the point. As the Court of\nAppeal stated inRe Beloff (CA)at\n[62]: “‘Necessity’, or ‘need’, contemplates a somewhat high threshold,\nhigher at any rate than a matter of ‘desirability’ or ‘preference’.” The relevant pool of local counsel 87     Having\nestablished that Mr Sharma’s judicial review application does not\nattract complex or difficult issues, it follows that the relevant\npool of local counsel which he should have approached is substantially\nenlarged. I therefore agree with the Attorney-General and the Law\nSociety’s submissions that Mr Sharma should not have confined his\nsearch for legal assistance to only the handful of local SCs. I\nnote, however, that Mr Vergis sought to address this point during\nthe hearing by emphasising that, in some instances, it was not just\nindividual SCs who hadpersonallydeclined to\nrepresent Mr Sharma but thatwholefirmswere doing so. The result of this\nwas that many local non-SCs in these firms who might have been approached\nwere taken out of the picture in one fell swoop. Accordingly, Mr\nVergis stressed that it was not for want of trying that Mr Sharma\ncould not engage competent local counsel, but the circumstances\nwhich were unfolding at the time simply limited the avenues to which\nhe could turn. 88     In\nmy view, Mr Vergis’ argument benefitted from how the circumstances\neventually played out rather than being a true reflection of Mr Sharma’s\nstate of mind at the time. Mr Sharma had filed an affidavit with\nthe court’s leave setting out chronologically the lawyers whom he\nhad directly or indirectly approached to represent him and it is\nabundantly clear from this affidavit that his search was limited\nonly to local SCs (with Mr Edwin Tong as the possible exception).[note: 45]There was\na conspicuous absence in his account of events of a single approach\nmade to a local non-SC. Mr Sharma did not actually ask any non-SC\nin the law firms whom he had approached to act. They became unavailable\nbecause thoselaw firmsdecided\nnot to accept the brief. In my judgment, this disclosed the mindset of\na man for whom only the very best counsel would do. In the context\nof local counsel, that is eminently his prerogative. However, different considerations\ncome into play for foreign senior counsel. He certainly does not\nappear to have contemplated at all that it was still open for him\nto approach non-SCs in firms other than those which had already\nturned him down. The point being made here is not that a litigant\nmust exhaustallavailable local\noptions before resorting to foreign senior counsel but that there\ncannot be a natural gravitation towards local SCsonly.\nThe Court of Appeal inRe Beloff (CA)recognised\nthis point as much when it made the following observation at [63]\nthat “it has to be said that while the title of SC is a mark of\nprofessional distinction, one does not have to be an SC to be a very\nable litigator”. 89     In\nthese circumstances, I find that the “special reason” requirement\nin s 15(2) of the LPA could not be satisfied on the basis that there\nwas a lack of availability of local counsel. The situation is quite\nto the contrary in fact because Mr Sharma appears to have already\nretained a very competent local counsel in Mr Vergis. Whether or\nnot Mr Sharma wishes for Mr Vergis to continue representing him\nin the judicial review proceedings in the light of this decision\nis, of course, a matter entirely up to him to decide. However, for\nmy part, I should say that I was impressed by the quality of Mr\nVergis’ advocacy and he is certainly more than capable of advancing\nhis client’s position in the judicial review application.",
        "Whether there is a “special\nreason”": "66     Having\nfound that the Applicant does not satisfy themandatoryrequirement\nin s 15(1)(c) of the LPA, there\nis strictly no need to continue with the analysis. Nevertheless,\nI shall proceed to do so in the event that I am mistaken. In this\npart of the judgment, I consider whether there is a “special reason”\nto admit the Applicant pursuant to s 15(2) of the LPA read with\nr 32(1) of the Admission Rules. This issue arises because there\nis no dispute that the Applicant is seeking to be admitted for a\ncase falling within one of the three statutorily ring-fenced areas\nof legal practice,viz, administrative\nlaw.",
        "The applicable principles": "67     Before\nsetting out the parties’ respective arguments, it is useful to begin\nwith several propositions concerning the “special reason” requirement\nwhich have emerged from the recent decisions. 68     First,\nit is clear that the term “special reason” is one that is incapable of\nprecise definition. In fact, it is neither necessary nor desirable\nto attempt to define it. This point was well made by Rajah JA inRe Lord Goldsmithat [48]: … It would be something of a contradiction\nin terms to attempt to identify a prototypical “special reason”.\nIf it is something which one can reach for and define, it is also\nunlikely to be so out of the ordinary that it becomes a “special reason”.\nAny attempt to define “special reason” would require an exercise\nof the imagination to reach beyond issues or situations that one\nnormally encounters. That is not generally the practice of common\nlaw courts, which are better equipped to develop the law incrementally\nand by reference to the specific facts and circumstances of each\ncase. 69     The\nfocus is therefore on the particular circumstances of each case and\nthis leads to the second point about the “special reason” requirement\n– those circumstances must beexceptionalin\nnature (seeRe Caplanat [54];Re Lord Goldsmithat [48]). In this regard,\nRajah JA has further clarified that there is no sound policy reason\nto confine what can constitute exceptional circumstances only to\nthose cases which raise “macro” considerations (ie, considerations\nwhich transcended the specifics of any individual case) (seeRe Caplanat [54]). While that is likely\nto be the norm in practice, a case could well manifest exceptionality\neven though only the private interests of an individual, or issues\npertaining solely to him, are involved (seeRe Caplanat\n[54];Re Lord Goldsmithat [46]). 70     The\ntwo propositions mentioned thus far have been concerned with the\n“special reason” requirement standing on its own. The third, however, has\nto do with its place within the broader analytical framework forad hocadmissions. It is noted that there\nwas, at one point, a preference for an approach known as the “twin\nkey” approach which regarded the “special reason” requirement as\none of two keys (seeRe Caplanat\n[48];Re Lord Goldsmithat [40]).\nThe other key represented the composite list of factors in para\n3 of the Notification and both had to be turned successfully in\norder to unlock the door toad hocadmission.\nImportantly, the “twin key” approach did not prescribe a sequence\nfor turning the keys. However, it should be clear from the analytical\nframework set out at [44] above that the Court of Appeal inRe Beloff (CA)has since taken a slightly\ndifferent view. In this regard, the Court of Appeal has unambiguously\nstated (at [50]) that the “special reason” requirement is in the\nnature of a mandatorythresholdrequirement\nthat “must be metbeforeturning\nto the other considerations” [emphasis added]. Nevertheless, it\nshould be stressed that the fact that the “special reason” requirement\nand the Notification factors now clearly occupy distinct stages\nof the overall inquiry does not mean that they areentirelyseparate\nand distinct from one another – they are stilllinked.\nThe court must, accordingly, “have regard to the individual considerations\nin the context of how they relate to or affect one another” (seeRe Beloff (CA)at [55]). Putting it in\nanother way, one must avoid viewing the “special reason” requirement\nand the Notification factors in their individual silos. Such an\napproach necessarily overlooks their possible interactions with\none another and thus might lead to an impoverished analysis.",
        "Conclusion": "90     The\nApplicant therefore fails to satisfy twomandatoryrequirements in\nss 15(1)(c) and 15(2) of the LPA,\nthough failure to satisfyeitherof\nthe two would have been fatal to the application. Accordingly, the\napplication is dismissed. 91     I\nshould mention, for completeness, that although I have not, in this judgment,\nspecifically dealt with the four Notification factors, the first\nthree of these factors have already been considered in the context\nof discussing the “special reason” cited by Mr Sharma (see [74]\nabove). For the same reasons stated at [76]–[89] above, I am of\nthe view that the three factors do not weigh in favour of admitting\nthe Applicant and, accordingly, I would have answered the “ultimate\nquestion” as set out in the fourth Notification in the negative,ie, it isnotreasonable,\nhaving regard to all the circumstances of the case, to admit the\nApplicant.",
        "Costs": "92     In\naddition to the prescribed fees payable to the Law Society under s 15(5)\nof the LPA, the Law Society is also seeking costs as respondent\nto this application. As the application has been dismissed for failure\nto satisfy the two mandatory requirements under ss 15(1)(c) and 15(2) of the LPA, there should\nnormally be costs consequence. However since the costs incurred\nby the Law Society as respondent would have been incurred in any event\nfor which the prescribed fees have already been paid, I make no further\norder as to costs for this application.
