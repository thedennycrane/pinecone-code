DC Suit No.229/2000 and the aforementioned DC\n\nSuit No.784/2000. These two actions were consolidated and District Judge Laura Lau\n\ndismissed the first one and gave judgment for the Defendant (i.e. the plaintiff in the\n\nsuit) in the second. The Plaintiff naturally was happy with the decision in DC Suit\n\nNo.229/2000, but not so with that in DC Suit No.784/2000.3\n\n        The last day of filing of the Notice of Appeal\n\npermitted by the rules was 26 November 2001. On 23 November, the Plaintiff instructed his\n\nsolicitors to file the appeal. He did this by telephone as he was in Japan at the time.\n\nHowever the appeal was not filed on time. His counsel, Mr Simon Tan, explained what had\n\nhappened in an affidavit filed in this summons:3. The [Plaintiff] instructed us\n\n    to appeal against the decision of the learned District Judge… His instructions were\n\n    given before the period to appeal expired on 26 November 2001.4. However, we discovered that\n\n    our client did not have the funds in our client’s account to deposit the sum of\n\n    S$3,000 with the Accountant-General. As he was outstationed in Japan, he could only give\n\n    us the sum of S$3,000 upon his return from Japan which he eventually did on 7 December\n\n    2001.5. On his assurance that he will\n\n    put me in funds upon his return, I issued a .. cheque … dated 26 November 2001 in\n\n    favour of the Accountant-General but my court clerk was unable to file the application\n\n    before the expiry date on 26 November 2001. …6. On 5 December 2001, I\n\n    proceeded to apply to the Subordinate Courts for leave to file the Notice of Appeal out of\n\n    time.7. On 17 January 2002, the\n\n    application was heard by … Magistrate Mr Adam Nakhoda and I was given leave to\n\n    withdraw the application on the basis that it should have been filed in the High Court\n\n    pursuant to Order 55D Rule 14 of the Rules of Court.8. On 30 January 2002, my firm\n\n    re-filed the application electronically but due to inadvertence on my firm’s part, it\n\n    was re-fixed [for] hearing again in the Subordinate Courts despite the fact that we\n\n    indicated that this application was to be heard in the High Court.9. The application came up for\n\n    hearing on 18 March 2002 and it was heard by … District Judge Laura Lau …\n\n    whereby she gave me leave to withdraw the application again with no order as to costs.4\n\n        It would appear from Mr Tan’s affidavit,\n\nand indeed he conceded before me, that there were three mistakes made by his firm:(i) failing to file the Notice of\n\n    Appeal on 26 November 2001;(ii) on 5 December 2001, applying\n\n    for leave to appeal out of time by way of SIC in the action in the District Court instead\n\n    of by Originating Summons in the High Court; and(iii) on 30 January 2002, filing\n\n    the Originating Summons in the Subordinate Courts instead of the High Court.It was only on the fourth attempt\n\non 28 March 2002 in the present summons that Mr Tan’s firm was able to get it\n\ncorrect. By that time slightly over four months had elapsed since 26 November 2001, the\n\ndate due to file the Notice of Appeal under the Rules of Court. In connection with these\n\nthree mistakes there were three instances of unexplained delays as I shall elaborate\n\nbelow.Mistake No. 15\n\n        In respect of the failure to file the Notice of\n\nAppeal on 26 November 2001, Mr Tan gave some explanation in Chambers about his firm’s\n\ncheque being unacceptable that I was unable to make sense of. He certainly did not\n\nelaborate in his affidavit why his court clerk was unable to file the application on that\n\nday. Neither did he back it up with any document. The long and short of it is that he had\n\nfailed to file a Notice of Appeal by the date due under the Rules of Court.Delay No. 16\n\n        By itself, this mistake is not necessarily\n\nfatal. Any solicitor would have taken immediate steps to rectify it by making an\n\napplication to extend time. Unfortunately Mr Tan chose not to take any immediate action.\n\nInstead he waited a good eight days before filing in such an application on 5 December\n\n2001. He gave no explanation in his affidavit for this delay.Mistake No.27\n\n        But he still was unable to get it right.\n\nInstead of making an application to the High Court, he applied to the Subordinate Courts.\n\nOrder 55D of the Rules of Court provides for appeals from the Subordinate Courts to the\n\nHigh Court. In respect of an application for extension of time to file and service notice\n\nof appeal, O 55D r 14 provides as follows:Without prejudice to the power of\n\n    the High Court under Order 3, Rule 4, to extend the time prescribed by any provision of\n\n    this Order, the period for filing and serving the notice of appeal under paragraph (1) of\n\n    Rule 4 may be extended by the Court below on application made before the expiration of\n\n    that period.8\n\n        It is clear on the face of this rule that an\n\napplication for extension of time may be made to the Court below only if it is made before\n\nthe expiration of the period for filing and serving the notice of appeal. If that period\n\nhas expired, then the application can only be made to the High Court pursuant to its\n\ngeneral powers to extend time under O 3 r 4. If the construction of O 55D r 14 (or its\n\npredecessor) had not been clear before, any doubt would have been eradicated since the\n\nHigh Court decision inChen Chien Wen v Pearson[1991] SLR 578. The matter there\n\npertains to O 57 r 4 of the Rules of Supreme Court in force at the time, which is in the\n\nsame terms as O 55D r 14 under consideration. Order 57 r 4 provides as follows:Without prejudice to the power of\n\n    the Court of Appeal under O 3 r 5, to extend the time prescribed by any provision of this\n\n    Order, the period for serving notice of appeal under r 4 … may be extended by the\n\n    Court below on application made before the expiration of that period.It was held that the High Court\n\nhas no jurisdiction to extend time to serve the notice of appeal where the application is\n\nmade after expiration of the prescribed period for service and that an extension of time\n\nin such circumstances can only be granted by the Court of Appeal.9\n\n        Mr Tan said that he was misled by the decision\n\ninTan Thye Heng v Pan Mercantile[1989] SLR 973. The appellant there filed a\n\nnotice of appeal within the prescribed time but served it one day late, on the fifteenth\n\nday. The appellant applied to the High Court for extension of time for service. The\n\nrespondent raised a preliminary objection on the basis that such an application should\n\nhave been made to the District Court as there was no appeal yet before the High Court.\n\nThis argument was accepted by the judge. However that case concerns the Subordinate Courts\n\nRules 1986. The present case falls under the Rules of Court (1997 Ed) which is an entirely\n\ndifferent regime as the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts rules have become merged.\n\nUnder O 3 r 4 of the Rules of Court the High Court has jurisdiction to extend any period\n\nprescribed in those rules, including the period for filing notice of appeal against the\n\ndecision of a Subordinate Court. Crucially, there is no equivalent provision to O 55D r 14\n\nin the Subordinate Courts Rules 1986. It is therefore difficult to comprehend how any\n\nsolicitor can be misled by that decision.Delay No. 210\n\n        When the application came up for hearing before\n\nthe Registrar at the Subordinate Courts on 17 January 2002, Mr Tan withdrew it upon\n\nrealising the correct legal position. But again he did not act with expedition even though\n\nby now he was already more than one and a half months out of time. He waited another\n\ntwelve days before filing the OS application on 30 January 2002. No reason was given in\n\nhis affidavit for this delay.Mistake No.311\n\n        For the third time Mr Tan or his firm could not\n\nget it right. Due to \"inadvertence\", the application was again filed in the\n\nSubordinate Courts. He appears to suggest that it was on account of the Electronic Filing\n\nSystem (\"EFS\"). He said that this was despite the fact that they had \"indicated\n\nthat this application was to beheard in the High Court\". However he did\n\nnot elaborate on this. If it was on account of unfamiliarity with the EFS system, I would\n\nsay two things. Firstly, the EFS was already up and running since March 2000, almost years\n\nearlier. Secondly, it is a matter of specifying the Court concerned. Mr Tan did not deem\n\nit fit to explain how this inadvertence came about. The onus is upon him to explain it\n\nclearly and he had chosen not to.Delay No. 312\n\n        Mr Tan realised the error on 18 March 2002 when\n\nhe appeared before District Judge Laura Lau. For a third time, he did not act to file the\n\npresent summons until 28 March 2002, a lapse of nine days. Yet again, no explanation was\n\ngiven for this delay. As I have pointed out earlier, by this time more than four months\n\nhad passed since the original deadline for filing the notice.Merits of the appeal13\n\n        This action is a claim for the sum of $122,700\n\nin respect of a quantity of Koi fish that the Defendant claimed he had sold to the\n\nPlaintiff. In his defence, the Plaintiff denied the existence of such a transaction. The\n\ndecision of the District Judge would turn substantively on questions of fact. In arriving\n\nat that decision the judge would have had the benefit of hearing the evidence of the\n\nwitnesses and observing them in the course of the trial which lasted seven days. The\n\nPlaintiff would have great difficulty in appealing against findings of fact.Conclusion14\n\n        In relation to the three mistakes, any single\n\none might, in the circumstances, have moved the Court to exercise its discretion to extend\n\ntime. But three mistakes were made and there is no full and frank explanation as to how\n\nthey came about.15\n\n        On top of that the Plaintiff’s counsel had\n\nnot acted with the due expedition that the Court would expect in such matters. This\n\nhappened not once but three times, resulting in a wholly unnecessary delay of 29 days.\n\nThis has to be considered in the context of the 14-day period under the Rules of Court for\n\nthe Plaintiff to file and serve the notice of appeal.16\n\n        Furthermore, the entire proceedings was dragged\n\nout for four months as a result. One of the prayers in this summons is for a stay of\n\nexecution of judgment pending appeal. Although Mr Tan had withdrawn that prayer at the\n\nhearing before me, that was not until 8 May 2002, more than five months after the date due\n\nfor filing notice of appeal. That would have obstructed or delayed enforcement action by\n\nthe Defendant. The Defendant has obviously been prejudiced by this.17\n\n        The circumstances of this case clearly do not\n\njustify the Court exercising its discretion to extend the time to file and serve the\n\nnotice of appeal. To do so would also send the wrong signal to the profession as to the\n\nstandard demanded of it by the Courts and the public.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSUPREME COURT"
