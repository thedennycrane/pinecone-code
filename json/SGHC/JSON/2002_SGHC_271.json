        "The facts": "2.        On 3 August 2000 at about\n\n5pm, Paul Bayliss Brown (the defendant) with his fiance Cindy Sim (the plaintiff) riding\n\npillion, was riding motorcycle no. FR 8924R (the motorcycle) along Commonwealth Avenue\n\nWest in the direction of Clementi Avenue 6. At the junction of the two roads, the\n\ndefendant stopped as the traffic light was red, and waited for the light to change to\n\ngreen before he turned right into Clementi Avenue 6. As he moved off towards the right\n\nafter the traffic light had changed to green, lorry no. YG 8791P (the lorry) which was\n\ndriven by the first Third Party collided into the rear of the motorcycle.3.        As a result of the\n\ncollision, both the plaintiff and defendant were thrown off the motorcycle; the plaintiff\n\nlanded on a pile of roadwork debris. They were taken to National University Hospital by\n\nambulance where an emergency operation was carried out on the plaintiff. The defendant\n\nsuffered minor injuries (cuts and bruises) but the injuries sustained by the plaintiff\n\nwere more serious. She suffered a degloving injury to her right knee, besides bruises to\n\nher left forearm and right arm. The plaintiff was in and out of hospital for abut nine (9)\n\nmonths thereafter for more operations and treatment, arising from her initial injuries.",
        "The claim": "4.        The plaintiff sued the\n\ndefendant (who has since married her) for negligence in his riding, management and control\n\nof the motorcycle. She (inter alia) alleged that defendant had speeded, had failed to keep\n\na safe distance from the lorry, had failed to keep a proper or any lookout and had paid\n\ninsufficient regard to other vehicles at the junction, in particular the lorry, while\n\nwaiting to turn into Clementi Avenue 6.5.        The defendant denied he\n\nwas negligent. He contended that it was the first Third Party/lorry driver who was\n\nnegligent in the driving, control and management of the lorry and caused the collision.\n\nAfter he had filed the defence, the defendant issued Third Party proceedings against both\n\nthe lorry driver and lorry owners (the second Third Party) and filed a statement of claim\n\nagainst them. In the event he was found to be liable to the plaintiff, the defendant\n\nclaimed to be indemnified by the Third Parties.6.        In the defence they filed\n\nto the defendant's statement of claim, apart from admitting that it occurred, the Third\n\nParties denied the first Third Party caused the accident. Both Third Parties alleged that\n\nit was the defendant who caused or contributed to the collision by his negligent driving\n\nand control of the motorcycle. Consequently, they denied they were liable for any\n\nindemnity or contribution towards the plaintiff's claim or for her costs or, the costs of\n\nthe third party proceedings.",
        "The evidence": "(i)    the plaintiff's and defendant's case7.        I will consider the\n\nplaintiff's and defendant's evidence together as their testimony was fairly\n\nstraightforward.8.        The plaintiff (PW2)\n\ntestified that on the day in question, she and the defendant were returning home to West\n\nCoast Road via Clementi Avenue 6, after shopping at International Mega Mart (IMM). She and\n\nthe defendant were wearing crash helmets at the material time; this made conversation and\n\nhearing difficult. The defendant was travelling on the extreme right lane which allowed\n\ntraffic to turn into Clementi Avenue 6; the lorry occupied the second lane from the right\n\nwith its wheels straddling onto the motorcycle's lane slightly (by about 20cm). As the\n\ntraffic lights turned green in favour of traffic proceeding straight towards Commonwealth\n\nAvenue West, the defendant rode the motorcycle forward into the box junction preparing to\n\nturn right. Suddenly, the defendant changed direction and proceeded straight ahead. The\n\nmotorcycle then travelled along Commonwealth Avenue West before it collided into a road\n\nsign. She and the defendant were thrown off the motorcycle.9.        Cross-examined, the\n\nplaintiff (PW2) could not explain why the defendant rode the motorcycle straight instead\n\nof turning right. She was unable to recollect clearly what transpired due to her shock\n\nwhen she saw the lorry coming very close to her as the motorcycle was proceeding to turn\n\nright. The plaintiff's recollection of events was unclear, no doubt due to the trauma she\n\nexperienced from the collision.10.        In his written testimony\n\n(para 6), the defendant (DW1) had deposed that the traffic light had turned green in his\n\nfavour, when he moved the motorcycle forward, travelling in the middle of the extreme\n\nright lane. In court, he corrected that statement and said that the junction did not have\n\na proper/permanent traffic light but only a temporary one as there were road works; there\n\nwas also no separate green arrow for turning traffic.11.        Because of the road works\n\nand the erection of a large silver metal siding at the junction, the defendant said it was\n\ndifficult to check for on-coming traffic without going forward, which was what he did when\n\nthe traffic light turned green. As he did so, he found to his horror that the protruding\n\n(undercarriage) portion of the lorry had locked onto the rear portion of the motorcycle.\n\nHe moved forward to wrest the motorcycle free of the lorry's hold. He then leaned to his\n\nright to try to move away from the lorry which was already turning right but, the\n\nhandlebars of the motorcycle failed to respond. As he was leaning right, he felt a massive\n\nforce at the motorcycle's left rear side. It happened so quickly (in a matter of seconds)\n\nthat he was not aware of what hit him. The next thing he knew was, that the motorcycle had\n\nturned 90 angle across the front of the lorry; he had no alternative but to throttle as\n\nhard as he could to get out of the lorry's path. He then felt an even greater force\n\nhitting the left rear side of the motorcycle. The defendant said he managed to avoid the\n\nlorry and headed in the direction of the road-works sign which had been placed at the\n\njunction. He braked very hard and (with the plaintiff) was thrown off the motorcycle; he\n\nwent over its handle bars and security screen, was thrown back onto and then underneath,\n\nthe motorcycle while the plaintiff landed in a pile of debris.12.        Questioned by the court\n\non the plaintiff's testimony that he had suddenly changed direction and proceeded straight\n\ninstead of turning right, the defendant pointed out that the plaintiff was only a pillion\n\nrider, she had no experience in driving a powerful machine (1,200 cc) like the motorcycle.\n\nHe, on the other hand, had over 30 years' experience as a motorcyclist. Consequently, it\n\nwas only her perception he had changed direction to go straight when in actual fact he was\n\ntrying desperately to disengage the motorcycle from the lorry. The defendant explained\n\nthat the motorcycle had a 'crumple zone' which enabled him to maintain his balance when\n\nthe lorry hit the machine; otherwise he would not have survived the collision. In effect,\n\nthe lorry collided twice with the motorcycle.13.        The defendant denied the\n\nfirst Third Party's allegation in the latter's police report, that he had failed to turn\n\nright. On the contrary, the defendant asserted, he had turned right, having first switched\n\non his signal lights to indicate his intention to do so. It was the lorry driver who had\n\nfailed to notice his presence, according to what the first Third Party told the defendant\n\nimmediately after the collision. It was the lorry that collided into the motorcycle, not\n\nvice versa. He further denied the first Third Party's allegation that he smelt of alcohol\n\nwhen he approached the first Third Party after the collision. The defendant contended he\n\ndid not consume alcohol at IMM, not even a beer. Neither was he going fast, nor was he in\n\na hurry as, the plaintiff only needed to be in Bishan two (2) hours later for a dinner\n\nappointment with her mother. He was not travelling too close to the lorry either. He\n\ndisagreed with counsel's suggestion that it was the motorcycle which had grazed the lorry\n\nbut conceded he could have allowed the lorry to turn right first.14.        Cross-examined, the\n\ndefendant confirmed that the lorry straddled his lane, even though this fact was omitted\n\nfrom his affidavit as well as from his police report (which was lodged five [5] days\n\nlater). He had stopped at the junction when the lorry drew up alongside about 1.5m away\n\nfrom the motorcycle. Although he was a foreigner, the defendant had been in Singapore for\n\nabout 4 years, at the time of the accident. Questioned by the court, the defendant\n\nclarified that the extreme right lane in which he was travelling was the compulsory\n\nturning lane whereas, the second lane which the lorry occupied was an optional turning\n\nlane, which also allowed traffic to proceed straight to Commonwealth Avenue West.15.        The plaintiff had called\n\nas her witness the investigating officer of the accident. However, the evidence of\n\nSergeant Chong Mui Fong (PW1) was not particularly helpful as, she arrived at the scene at\n\nabout 6.30pm, by which time the plaintiff and defendant had been taken to National\n\nUniversity Hospital. She said the first Third Party did not mention in his statement to\n\nthe police that the defendant smelt of alcohol at the time. The police damage report (see\n\n1AB9) prepared by Sergeant Chong showed that the motorcycle had its front tyre punctured,\n\nits steering broken and its two (2) side panniers scratched and damaged. The lorry on the\n\nother hand showed no visible damage.(ii)    the Third Party's case16.        I turn now to consider\n\nthe testimony presented for the Third Parties by the first Third Party, who was the only\n\nwitness for their case.17.        The 68 year old first\n\nThird Party (who has more than 40 years' experience as a lorry driver and still drives for\n\nthe second Third Party) testified that on the day of the accident, he wanted to get onto\n\nthe Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) via Clementi Avenue 6. The lorry has an unladen and a\n\nladen, weight of 8 and 16 tons respectively with 6 tyres, two (2) in front and four (4) at\n\nthe rear. He said he was then on his way to make a delivery of steel plates to a work-site\n\nat Telok Blangah Road, with two (2) workers.18.        At the junction of\n\nClementi Avenue 6 and Commonwealth Road West, the first Third Party said he took the\n\nsecond lane from the lane as firstly, it would be easier for him to negotiate the turn\n\ninto Clementi Avenue 6 (due to the length and size of the lorry) and secondly, there were\n\nroad works which precluded him from turning in the extreme right lane. He did not see the\n\nmotorcycle in the lane to his right although it was a clear day, the road surface was dry\n\nand traffic conditions were moderate.19.        The first Third Party\n\ntestified that as he approached the junction, the light was red. He stopped the lorry just\n\nbefore the white line; within seconds, the light changed green in his favour so he moved\n\nforward, looked into his mirror and turned right when he saw no oncoming traffic. Under\n\ncross-examination, the first Third Party clarified he did not look into his rear view\n\nmirror, only in his right wing mirror. He then heard a screeching sound of tyres at which\n\npoint, he noticed there was a motorcycle on his right which had grazed the front right\n\ntyre of the lorry; the motorcyclist (the defendant) then rode straight ahead and collided\n\ninto a road sign. He stopped the lorry, came out, saw the defendant and the plaintiff and\n\nwent forward to see if he could offer any assistance. The defendant appeared to be helping\n\nthe plaintiff. He deposed he smelt alcohol on the latter's breath when the defendant\n\napproached him.20.        After the plaintiff and\n\nthe defendant had been taken away to hospital by ambulance, the first Third Party lodged a\n\npolice report. He was never charged by the traffic police for any offence in relation to\n\nthe accident.21.        The first Third Party\n\ninsisted he did not collide into the motorcycle at all; he maintained it was the\n\nmotorcycle which had grazed the front right tyre of the lorry. He denied the lorry had\n\nstraddled the right lane occupied by the motorcycle.22.        Re-examined, the first\n\nThird Party explained that the two (2) passengers in the lorry with him that day were\n\nforeign workers who had since left Singapore and gone back to India; hence, their absence\n\nfrom court. Even so, the Third Parties could have taken statements from the foreign\n\nworkers before they returned to India.",
        "The decision": "23.        I was of the view on the\n\nevidence, that the acts of omission of both the defendant and the first Third Party\n\ncontributed to the collision which resulted in the plaintiff's injuries. On the\n\ndefendant's part, he failed to move away from the lorry when the vehicle came too close to\n\nhim. On the part of the lorry driver, he failed to notice the motorcycle at all. As I\n\ncould not determine further on the evidence who was more negligent, I held the defendant\n\nand the first Third Party to be equally liable. The second Third Party was sued\n\nvicariously for the acts of the first Third Party, who was their servant or agent.\n\nConsequently, the second Third Party was also liable with the first Third Party, for 50%\n\ncontribution to the plaintiff's claim.24.        In counsel's final\n\nsubmissions made on behalf of the Third Parties, he made much of what he considered were\n\ninconsistencies in the defendant's testimony. He had argued that his clients should not be\n\nliable at all, pointing out that the defendant's police report (lodged on 8 August 2000)\n\ndid not mention material particulars adduced from him in court, namely:(i) the position of the lorry at the time of the accident;(ii) that the lorry straddled the extreme right lane;(iii) that there was a protrusion from the lorry which locked onto the\n\n    rear portion of the motorcycle.25.        Counsel (Anparasan)\n\nsubmitted there was also a discrepancy between the defendant's police report and his oral\n\ntestimony in that in the former, the defendant had stated there was one (1) whereas in\n\ncourt, he testified there were two (2) collisions. The defendant's oral testimony was also\n\ndiscrepant with the sketch plan he drew in his police report; the position of the lorry\n\ndid not show that it straddled the extreme right lane. Given that the police report was\n\nnot lodged on the day itself but 5 days after the accident, the defendant's excuse of\n\ntrauma being the reason for the inaccuracies in his sketch/the police report cannot be\n\ntrue. Counsel said that the alleged straddling by the lorry onto the motorcycle's lane was\n\na very material fact which, if true, meant that the first Third Party was negligent.\n\nHowever, such a material fact was not even pleaded in the defendant's statement of claim\n\nagainst the Third Parties. It was also not reflected in the plaintiff's written testimony.\n\nAs such, counsel asked the court to ignore the defendant's allegation that the lorry\n\nstraddled the motorcycle's lane.26.        I was not persuaded by\n\ncounsel's submissions that the discrepancies between the defendant's oral testimony and\n\nhis police report were so material as to render the defendant's testimony unreliable. I\n\nwould point out that by the same token, the first Third Party's oral testimony was also\n\ndiscrepant with the police report he himself lodged the very same day. In his written\n\ntestimony, the first Third Party had alleged that the defendant's breath smelt of alcohol.\n\nYet such a material fact was neither mentioned on 3 August 2000 to Sergeant Chong nor\n\nstated in the first Third Party's police report. It was obviously an afterthought\n\nconcocted to put the defendant in a bad light. I do not put too much store in what is\n\nstated in a police report, bearing in mind that more often than not (although not\n\napplicable to the defendant here), it is a police officer who helps a party to write out\n\nthe report.27.        What I noted was, the\n\ndamage to the motorcycle recorded in the police damage report and shown in the defendant's\n\nphotographs was consistent with the testimony of the defendant. The lorry escaped damage\n\nbecause the force it applied to the motorcycle was due to its hooking some part of the\n\nmotorcycle and it dragged the motorcycle forward when making the right turn; there were no\n\ncollisions as such although the defendant felt the sensation of the impacts as if the\n\nmotorcycle was being hit in the rear.28.        I was mindful of the fact\n\nthat the defendant and the plaintiff are now husband and wife but I do not think that fact\n\nper se rendered the plaintiff's testimony any the less credible. She had said she did not\n\nknow why the defendant suddenly changed direction to go straight instead of turning right\n\nand left it to him to explain his actions to the court; there was no attempt by her to\n\ncover up for him. The defendant's fault lay in his being too close to the lorry. He owed\n\nhimself a duty as a road-user to be careful even if other road-users were careless. Had\n\nthe defendant been more observant, even granted he was wearing a safety helmet, he would\n\nhave noticed how dangerously close the lorry was, and should have shifted the motorcycle\n\nmore to his right.29.        As for the first Third\n\nParty, his cross-examination (N/E 21) had adduced the following evidence:-Q: When you were approaching junction, did you see the motorcycle on\n\n    the right lane?A: I didn't see the motorcycle and there were no other vehicles as\n\n    well.Q: When you stopped at junction, did you see motorcycle to your right?A:    There was no vehicle/motorcycle on the right side.Q: When was the first time you saw the motorcycle?A: When motorcycle grazed front right tyre of my lorry.The testimony supported my conclusion that the first Third Party failed\n\nto keep a proper lookout for other traffic on the road. Clearly there were other vehicles\n\nor at least one other vehicle (the motorcycle), on the road alongside him; he just did not\n\nsee. Neither did he notice he was straddling the lane to his right, nor did he have any\n\ninkling the lorry had hooked onto and dragged the motorcycle along until he was alerted by\n\nthe screeching sound.30.        I therefore concluded\n\nthat the first Third Party was not paying enough attention to surrounding traffic that\n\nday. The lorry was much higher and bigger than the motorcycle and its driver should have\n\nseen the defendant and the plaintiff quite easily had he really checked the right side\n\nmirror (as he claimed) and looked into the rear view mirror. The first Third Party\n\ntestified that he did not see any tyre marks on the road. That must mean he did not apply\n\nthe brakes of the lorry at all, because he did not see the motorcycle. It would also be\n\nconsistent with the defendant's testimony that the motorcycle was dragged along by the\n\nlorry's momentum and the motorcycle's brakes/handlebars were rendered useless, after the\n\nmachine became entangled with part of the lorry's undercarriage. The defendant managed to\n\ndisengage the motorcycle at one stage and I believe the direction change thereafter was\n\nnot voluntary but done to avoid the lorry; otherwise the motorcycle may have gone under\n\nthe wheels of the lorry.",
        "Conclusion": "31.        While the defendant was\n\nundoubtedly liable to the plaintiff for the injuries she suffered as a result of the\n\naccident, the first Third Party was equally responsible for what happened. Consequently,\n\nit was only fair to apportion liability equally between the parties, which I did.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
