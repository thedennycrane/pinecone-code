        "(i)\n\n        Ha Siew Sen, the first defendant": "5.\n\n        In his affidavit, the first defendant stated\n\nthat when he decided to overtake the bus, he ensured there was no vehicle on the lane next\n\nto him and also looked into the mirror to ensure there was no vehicle behind him. He then\n\nsignalled to change lane. He was travelling at about 50 kmph at this juncture. He had\n\nchanged lane and was just about to overtake the bus when the bus suddenly slowed down and\n\nmoved into his lane and thereby cut into his path. He could not slow down or stop in time.\n\nAs a result, the back of the bus hit his motorcycle and both he and the plaintiff fell.6.\n\n        The first defendant asserted that the bus\n\ndriver did not signal or indicate at any time his intention to change lane or slow down.\n\nHe changed lane recklessly and was solely to blame for causing the accident. If the bus\n\ndriver had stayed in his lane, the accident would not have had happened. The bus emerged\n\nonto the lane on which he was riding without ascertaining that it was safe to do so.7.\n\n        Under cross-examination, the first defendant\n\nsaid that when he first saw the bus, he was about nine car lengths away from it. At that\n\ntime, his speed was between 80 and 90 kmph and he was in the left lane. When he was four\n\nor five car lengths away from the bus, he decided to overtake it and at that stage, he\n\nincreased his speed to between 90 and 100 kmph. When he entered the right lane, he was\n\ntravelling at this faster speed and at that time, the bus was only about a foot away from\n\nhim. The bus was then in the left lane and the first defendant was in the right lane about\n\nten inches away from the white line on his left. He then proceeded to try and overtake the\n\nbus but it suddenly entered his lane and the collision took place. He said that the rear\n\ncorner of the bus collided with his motorcycle.",
        "(ii)\n\n        Rashitha Bibi": "8.\n\n        Madam Rashitha was a passenger on the bus at\n\nthe time of the accident. She was sitting in the third seat behind the driver on the right\n\nside of the bus. Suddenly she heard a thud. She turned to her right and saw a motorcycle\n\nswerve across the lane and the pillion rider’s neck was in between the bushes. The\n\nmotorcycle went on and dragged the pillion rider for some distance. The bus was in the\n\nleft lane. There was a bus stop a short distance away. The driver stopped at the bus stop\n\nand all the passengers alighted. The witness went forward to the driver who was looking\n\nlost and gave him her name and telephone number and offered to be a witness as she\n\nconsidered he was not to blame for the accident.9.\n\n        Madam Rashitha confirmed that the bus was\n\ndefinitely in the left lane at the time of the thud because just a while later, the driver\n\nstopped at the bus stop and the motorcycle went right across to go into the bushes beside\n\nthe right lane. She did not feel the bus swerve to the right at any time. It was a gentle\n\nsteady ride until suddenly the bus stopped. She thought that the speed of the bus was\n\nmoderate.",
        "(iii)\n\n        Senior Staff Sergeant Kasmawati Samian": "10.\n\n        Sergeant Kasmawati was the officer in charge of\n\ninvestigating this accident. She interviewed the first defendant on the day of the\n\naccident at the A&E department of the National University Hospital. The first\n\ndefendant told her how the accident took place. At that time, he did not tell her that it\n\nwas the bus that had changed lane and caused the accident. He did not say that the sole\n\ncause of the accident was the changing of lane by the bus.11.\n\n        Subsequently, action was taken by the traffic\n\npolice against the first defendant for inconsiderate riding under s 25 of the Road Traffic\n\nAct. A summons was issued charging him that on 23 February 1998 he rode his motorcycle\n\nwithout reasonable consideration for other users, to wit by failing to keep a proper\n\nlookout resulting in collision with SBS bus 1806L. The decision to prosecute was based on\n\nthe investigations which disclosed that the first defendant was travelling directly behind\n\nthe bus on the left lane of Woodlands Road and when he decided to overtake the bus, the\n\nleft handle of the motorcycle hit the rear left hand side of the bus causing him to lose\n\ncontrol of the motorcycle. During the interview, the first defendant had mentioned that he\n\nhad misjudged the situation when he was in the process of changing the lane and overtaking\n\nthe bus. The first defendant settled the traffic summons by paying the composition fine.",
        "(iv)\n\n        Irusan A/L Rajoo": "12.\n\n        The driver stated that on the day in question\n\nat about 8.30am he was driving the bus along Woodlands Road and at all times was\n\ntravelling along the left lane of the road. Traffic volume was light and there were no\n\nmotor vehicles travelling in front of his bus. Suddenly he heard a shout at the right rear\n\nside of the bus and he then looked at his right wing mirror and saw a motorcycle wobbling.\n\nThe motorcycle thereafter veered to the right and collided into the centre divider. When\n\nhe saw the motorcycle wobbling he brought the bus to a halt. He asserted that at all times\n\nhe was travelling at a straight course along the left lane. As there were no vehicles in\n\nfront of him at the material time, it was not necessary for him to change lane nor did he\n\nat any time intend to do so.13.\n\n        Under cross-examination, the bus driver stated\n\nthat there were some vehicles at his rear prior to the accident. There were no vehicles on\n\nthe right lane. The only vehicle he remembered seeing behind him was a white oil tanker.\n\nHe checked his rear view mirror from time to time but did not see the motorcycle prior to\n\nthe accident. He only noticed it after he heard the thud coming from the rear of his bus.\n\nAfter he stopped his bus, he checked its rear and noticed a scratch mark there, slightly\n\nabove the rear bumper. He believed the handle of the motorcycle caused it. The bus driver\n\ndenied that he had changed lane because he had been intending to turn right at the\n\nT-junction at the end of the road. He asserted that there was no need to change lane to\n\nmake a right turn at the T-junction because he could make this turn from the left lane.Findings14.\n\n        The plaintiff gave evidence but was unable to\n\nremember anything about the accident because of the severe head injuries that he\n\nsustained. As he was an innocent party, it was clear that he was entitled to his damages.\n\nThe only issue was whether one or both the defendants were to blame for the accident.15.\n\n        The stretch of road along which the accident\n\nhappened was a straight road and had a 50-kmph limit. The first defendant had originally\n\nstated in his affidavit that he was travelling at 50 kmph but in court he testified that\n\nhis speed was 80 to 90 kmph originally and it increased by another ten kmph when he\n\nentered the right lane. He also admitted that he was only a foot away from the bus when it\n\ncut into his lane. It was quite clear from this evidence that the first defendant was\n\nnegligent as he was attempting to overtake the bus at that excessive speed without having\n\ncreated a wide berth first between him and the bus. Thus, the main issue before me was\n\nwhether the bus driver had in any way contributed to the accident by cutting across the\n\npath of the first defendant as he had claimed.16.\n\n        It was clear also from the bus driver’s\n\ntestimony that he had not kept a good lookout, as he had not seen the motorcycle behind\n\nhim before the accident. Although his evidence that he had kept a straight course all\n\nalong was supported by Madam Rashitha’s testimony, certain parts of that evidence\n\nwere not satisfactory as she had stated that after the accident, he had not swerved before\n\nstopping at the bus stop at the left. The bus driver had stated that the bus came to a\n\nstop about 30 feet away from the accident and the bus stop was also about 30 feet away.\n\nThis would mean that the bus must have made a swerve to the left before it came to a stop.\n\nAlso, Madam Rashitha admitted that at the time of the accident, she was talking to the\n\npassenger sitting next to her on the bus and carrying her baby as well. Her observation of\n\nevents may therefore have been impaired.17.\n\n        Notwithstanding some difficulties with the\n\nevidence of the bus driver and Madam Rashitha, I was satisfied that the bus driver’s\n\nversion of events was essentially true. On the whole, the bus driver was a reliable\n\nwitness. I accepted that he had not swerved into the path of the motorcycle and therefore\n\nhad not been guilty of contributory negligence. There was no evidence to support the first\n\ndefendant’s contention that the bus had cut into his path without any signal or\n\nwarning.18.\n\n        Although it had been suggested that the bus\n\ndriver might have tried to move into the right lane so that the bus could turn right at\n\nthe T junction ahead, the evidence was that he did not need to do this as the right turn\n\ncould also have been made from the left lane of Woodlands Road. There was thus no reason\n\nfor the driver to have left his lane at all.19.\n\n        The first defendant was not a reliable witness.\n\nAs pointed out, he changed his evidence on the speed at which he was travelling. He also\n\nvacillated in his evidence regarding the volume of traffic at the time of the accident but\n\nfinally admitted, when shown the police report he had made at that time, that the volume\n\nof traffic had been light. Further, his testimony in court was inconsistent with the\n\nstatement he had given to Sergeant Kasmawati just after the accident. He admitted under\n\ncross-examination that his allegation of the bus suddenly changing lanes and thereby\n\ncausing the collision with his motorcycle was an important fact which he would have told\n\nthe investigating officer when describing the accident to her a few hours after the\n\naccident. The investigating officer’s testimony, however, was that he had made no\n\nsuch allegation against the bus driver but had instead admitted to her that it was his\n\nmisjudgement when he was in the process of changing lanes and overtaking the bus that had\n\ncaused the left handle of his motorcycle to collide with the rear of the bus. Although the\n\nfirst defendant had an early opportunity to put forward his assertion that the bus driver\n\nhad been negligent, he did not take it. It was not until his police report was made some\n\nfive days later that he asserted that the bus driver had cut into his path. This seemed to\n\nbe an afterthought.20.\n\n        The first defendant also gave evasive and\n\ninconsistent testimony in respect of the action taken against him by the police and his\n\npayment of the composition fine. Initially he denied that he was aware of any action taken\n\nagainst him by the police and that he had paid any composition fine. In his affidavit, he\n\nhad alleged that the negligence of the bus driver was the sole cause of the accident.\n\nHowever, when it was put to him that he paid the composition fine because he was at fault\n\nand caused the accident, he stated that he admitted that he was at fault but that he was\n\nnot entirely at fault.21.\n\n        On the evidence I was satisfied that, on the\n\nbalance of probabilities, the first defendant was wholly to blame for the accident.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPOREThis does not merit reportingCopyright © Government of Singapore."
