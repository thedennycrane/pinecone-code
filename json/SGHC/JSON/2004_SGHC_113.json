        "The mitigation plea": "11The accused was an odd-job labourer. He has a five-year-old son. He lived with his wife and his father, who is more than 70 years old, in a three-room Housing and Development Board flat in Teck Whye Avenue. As he was an odd-job labourer, he would often go to Mandai to pick durians and then sell them along the pavement of Block 146. 12When the deceased was assaulting him, the accused begged him to stop even as he retreated from the attack. He did not want to have a fight with the deceased. The knife was an old, rusty one used by the owner of the vegetable stall for his trade. He only wanted to use it to frighten the deceased. 13When the police arrived at the scene, he immediately admitted what he had done and told the police what had happened to the knife. He co-operated fully with the investigators. He asked his wife to retrieve the knife which he had told her earlier, while in a state of fright, to throw away in a nearby rubbish dump 14It did not occur to him to flee from the scene because he only wanted to save the deceased after he saw him collapse onto the floor. He got his friend, Pang Hock Guan, to go to a clinic nearby to get a doctor to attend to the deceased and the doctor did go to the scene. 15He was remorseful and pleaded for leniency.",
        "The decision of the court": "16Section 304(b) of the Penal Code provides for a maximum of ten years’ imprisonment or a fine or both. Many of the sentences meted out by the courts under this provision fall within the range of six to ten years. 17In this case, the accused was clearly not the aggressor. He was trying to make an honest living on the morning of 5 November 2003. He called the deceased over the telephone merely to inform him of his financial straits and to request more time for repayment of the loans for which he was charged exorbitant interest rates. He did not provoke the deceased in any way. 18It was the deceased who chose to go to confront the accused about the debt and who resorted to vulgarities and violence without provocation. He gave the accused no quarter and continued the punching despite the accused’s reluctance to retaliate by stepping backwards each time and in spite of his plea to talk things over and grant him indulgence of another two days. The deceased was of bigger build than the accused. 19The accused did not arm himself in advance despite knowing the deceased was going to his durian stall in a most foul mood. It was during this unprovoked and unrelenting attack that he saw, quite unfortunately, the rusty knife with a blade of some 9cm and took it to try to frighten the deceased away. The knife was not placed there as a weapon. The depth of the stab wound was probably contributed to by the deceased’s aggressive advance towards the accused. 20The accused’s instant and genuine remorse was clearly shown by his actions immediately after that one fatal stab. He was truly concerned for the deceased. He tried to stanch the bleeding although he had also suffered injuries inflicted by the deceased. He shouted to his friend to get medical help for the deceased. He did not try to flee from the scene. 21He did ask his wife to throw the knife away but that was probably said in a state of shock and panic rather than as a cold, calculated move to thwart justice. When the police asked him to co-operate with them, he told his wife to retrieve the knife from the rubbish dump. 22He was fully co-operative during the investigations and has pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. He also had a clean record. 23In these circumstances, although it is extremely sad that a life was lost over a debt of $1,800.00, the accused deserves whatever mercy the law is able to give him. I therefore sentence the accused to imprisonment of three years and six months, backdated to commence on 5 November 2003."
