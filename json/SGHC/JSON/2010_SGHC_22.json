        "Introduction": "1       This case concerned the recovery of sums already\n                    paid under a contract, and a counterclaim to recover further sums due under the\n                    same contract. On 10 December 2009, I delivered oral judgment dismissing\n                    both the main action and the defendant’s counterclaim. This written\n                    judgment sets out the detailed reasons for my decision. It will also revisit the\n                    legal principles governing an action for an agreed sum. 2       The plaintiff, Indulge Food Pte Ltd\n                    (“Indulge”), is a holding company. The defendant, Torabi Marashi\n                    Bahram (“Marashi”), a businessman, was the founder and managing\n                    director of Euoro International Pte Ltd (“Euoro”), a company that\n                    was, at the material time, in the business of selling herbal products and fruit\n                    and floral teas. On 2 November 2006, Indulge, Marashi and Euoro entered\n                    into a tripartite share subscription agreement (“the Subscription\n                    Agreement”). In the Subscription Agreement, Indulge agreed to invest $1m\n                    in Euoro in return for 50% of Euoro’s shares plus one share. The\n                    investment was to be made in four tranches of $250,000 each. Notably, the\n                    business aspect of the agreement envisaged joint efforts by Indulge, Marashi and\n                    Euoro to expand Euoro’s business, both within and outside\n                    Singapore. 3       Indulge paid the first two tranches totalling\n                    $500,000 to Euoro but did not pay the third and fourth tranches. Both before\n                    litigation and during the trial, Indulge justified its refusal to pay on the\n                    ground of Marashi and Euoro’s non-compliance with the conditions precedent\n                    to the payment of the third tranche set out in cl 3.4 of the Subscription\n                    Agreement. A failure to satisfy the conditions precedent in cl 3.4 would\n                    not only entitle Indulge to refuse to pay the third and fourth tranches to\n                    Euoro, it would also allow Indulge to terminate the Subscription Agreement and\n                    recover from Marashi the first two tranches already paid out to Euoro. Marashi\n                    denied that he was in breach of cl 3.4 of the Subscription Agreement, and\n                    in further response, Marashi brought a counterclaim against Indulge for payment\n                    to Euoro of the third and fourth tranches totalling $500,000. 4       In the course of the trial, it became apparent\n                    that Indulge’s true grievance was with Marashi’s management of\n                    Euoro. It was alleged, amongst other things, that Marashi was contractually\n                    obliged to apply Indulge’s cash injection towards the opening of new\n                    herbal stores and stores-in-stores, but had instead wrongly used the first and\n                    second tranches to pay Euoro’s existing creditors. It was obvious from the\n                    management accounts for the financial year 2007 that not much of the $500,000\n                    paid to Euoro was left by end April 2007. It was not surprising that Indulge\n                    attempted to negotiate a Supplemental Deed with Marashi and Euoro to,inter alia, protect the second half a million dollars of\n                    its investment. The Supplemental Deed was never signed. 5       In the witness box, Marashi confirmed that Euoro\n                    had, in fact, ceased business in August 2008, less than two years after the\n                    conclusion of the Subscription Agreement.[note: 1]After closing\n                    submissions were tendered, both sides were directed to submit on the relevance\n                    of Euoro’s cessation of business on the counterclaim and Euoro’s\n                    consequent inability to implement (through Marashi) its obligation under\n                    cl 7.2 to,inter alia, use its best\n                    endeavours to grow its revenues by implementing the business plan in Annex A of\n                    the Subscription Agreement (which principally entailed the opening of more\n                    stores). In the same correspondence, the parties were also directed to explain\n                    the absence of Euoro as a party in the present proceedings. Essentially, counsel\n                    for Marashi, Mr Harish Kumar, submitted that Euoro was entitled to recover\n                    the third and fourth tranches upon the satisfaction of the conditions precedent\n                    to payment of the third tranche and then the fourth tranche which would follow\n                    from the payment of the third tranche. Euoro’s cessation of the business,\n                    Mr Kumar argued, was attributed to Indulge’s failure to pay the third\n                    and fourth tranches. In response, counsel for Indulge, Ms Sugidha Nithi,\n                    submitted that since Euoro had ceased business, and there was nothing left to\n                    invest in, the appropriate remedy should be damages, and not the specific\n                    recovery of the third and fourth tranches.",
        "Indulge’s claim for the return of the first and second\n                tranches": "6       I begin with cl 3.4 of the Subscription\n                    Agreement which was central to Indulge’s case. Clause 3.4 is a long\n                        paragraph.[note: 2]For\n                    ease of reading and expediency, the material portions are set out in three\n                    separate parts as follows: Nate Corporation Inc is a company incorporated in California, United\n                        States of America with Marashi holding 70% of the shares thereof and Sutti\n                        Corporation holding 30% of the shares thereof…Marashi…shall\n                        transfer all his shares in Nate Corporation…to [Euoro] by or before\n                        10 Business Days prior to the Third Payment Date. … [Euoro] and Marashi shall give the [Indulge] evidence of the fulfilment of\n                        the condition as set out in this Clause and Clause 3.1(g), such\n                        evidence to be to the satisfaction of the [Indulge], no later than 10\n                        Business Days prior to the Third Payment Date. … If [Euoro] and/or Marashi fail to satisfy this Clause and\n                        Clause 3.1(g), [Indulge] has the option, upon giving written notice of\n                        the exercise thereof to [Euoro] and Marashi, to terminate this Agreement\n                        whereupon [Indulge] shall transfer all the Subscription Shares to Marashi\n                        and Marashi shall pay $500,000 to [Indulge]… The first part of cl 3.4 concerns Marashi’s obligations to\n                    transfer certain shares in a Californian corporation known as Nate Corporation\n                    (“Nate Corp”) to Euoro. The second part concerns Marashi’s\n                    obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the transfer. The third part\n                    concerns Indulge’s power to terminate the Subscription Agreement. Notably,\n                    Indulge is entitled under the termination provision in cl 3.4 to refuse to\n                    pay the third and fourth tranches; it also enables Indulge to recover the first\n                    and second tranches (totalling $500,000) already paid, from Marashi (as opposed\n                    to Euoro, who had, as mentioned, ceased business). It is therefore not difficult\n                    to see why Indulge founded its claim on cl 3.4. 7       Ms Nithi argued in her closing submissions\n                    that the termination provision in cl 3.4 was triggered because of three\n                    alternative reasons,viz: (a)     Marashi had not transferred his Nate\n                        Corp shares to Euoro; (b)     Marashi had not provided satisfactory evidence of the share transfer;\n                        and (c)     There was a\n                        failure of an implied condition that Sutti Corporation (“Sutti\n                        Corp”) was to remain a 30% shareholder of Nate\n                    Corp. Her arguments were addressed and rejected on 10\n                    December 2009 for the reasons stated below.",
        "The transfer of Marashi’s Nate Corp shares to Euoro": "8       It was not disputed that (i) Marashi and Sutti\n                    Corp’s shares in Nate Corp were cancelled, and (ii) new Nate Corp shares\n                    were issued to Euoro, with the result that Euoro was, at the relevant time, the\n                    owner of 100% of Nate Corp’s shares. I must mention here that Sutti Corp\n                    had voluntarily returned for cancellation its shares in Nate Corp before the\n                    third tranche fell due. Indulge’s objection was that the issue of Nate\n                    shares to Euoro in the manner described was not tantamount to compliance with\n                    Marashi’s obligation under cl 3.4. Ms Nithi argued, in essence,\n                    that Marashi was not only legally obliged to put Euoro in ownership of the\n                    requisite percentage of Nate Corp’s shares; he was, in addition, bound\n                    contractually to achieve that by way of a share transfer, and not through the\n                    issuance of new shares to Euoro and the cancellation of his own shares. The\n                    position adopted by Indulge was the result of its strict and literal reading of\n                    Marashi’s obligation under cl 3.4 to “transfer all his shares\n                    in Nate Corp” to Euoro. 9       Undeniably the literal terms of cl 3.4\n                    provided for the “transfer” of Nate Corp shares. However, such a\n                    literal reading of cl 3.4 was incompatible with the commercial purpose\n                    underlying cl 3.4 itself and the Subscription Agreement as a whole (see\n                    generallyZurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold\n                        Interior Design & Construction Pte Ltd[2008]\n                    3 SLR(R) 1029 (“Zurich\n                    Insurance”) at [131]). The plain purpose of cl 3.4 was to\n                    place Euoro in control of Nate Corp. Accordingly, it would not be an abuse of\n                    language to construe Marashi’s obligation to “transfer all his\n                    shares” to Euoro as requiring Marashi to put Euoro in the position of\n                    control it would be in if Marashi were to transfer all his shares to Euoro. By\n                    contrast, an interpretation that insisted on a direct transfer of shares would\n                    mean that the Subscription Agreement could be terminated even though Euoro was\n                    put in the same position of control by other means. Such a result would be\n                    implausible since the obvious purpose of the share transfer was, I repeat,\n                    simply to make Euoro the controlling shareholder of Nate Corp which,\n                    incidentally, was a shell company at all material times. 10     In my judgment, the use of the words\n                    “transfer of all his shares” in cl 3.4 was not, when read in\n                    context, meant to prescribe the method of making Euoro the controlling\n                    shareholder of Nate Corp. Clause 3.4 required Marashi to put Euoro in\n                    ownership of Nate Corp shares, and was indifferent to whether Marashi did so\n                    through a direct transfer, or through the issuance of Nate Corp shares to Euoro\n                    and the cancellation of his own shares. Accordingly, and since Euoro was in fact\n                    put in ownership of 100% of Nate Corp’s shares (Sutti Corp had as\n                    mentioned in[8]exited the company), I held\n                    that Marashi was not in breach of his obligation to transfer shares to Euoro. As\n                    an aside, I noted that while Ms Nithi highlighted the different procedures\n                    involved in a direct transfer of share and an issuance of new shares, she\n                    rightly did not argue that the procedural differences resulted in any material\n                    difference in Euoro’s acquiring control of Nate Corp. 11     In order to avoid any misimpression, I must\n                    emphasise that my conclusion rested on the true construction of cl 3.4, and\n                    not because it was sufficient for parties to broadly achieve the essence of the\n                    underlying purpose of their contractual obligations. In that connection, I\n                    rejected any suggestion by Mr Kumar, if that was his intention, that such a\n                    rule existed. Contractual clauses must be construed with their underlying\n                    purpose in mind, but ultimately parties must comply fully with their contractual\n                    obligations as properly construed. Anything less would be a\n                breach. 12     There was some argument over whether\n                    cl 3.4 wrongly described Marashi’s shareholding, and whether Marashi\n                    was required to transfer all his Nate Corp shareholding to Euoro even after\n                    Euoro had become a 70% shareholder of Nate Corp. It was not necessary for me to\n                    make a finding on those matters, since the parties did not ask for\n                    rectification, and there was equally no disagreement that Euoro was in fact a\n                    100% shareholder of Nate Corp by the relevant time.",
        "Satisfactory evidence of the share transfer": "13     Ms Nithi next argued that Marashi did not\n                    provide evidence of the share transfer “to the satisfaction of\n                    Indulge”, and that default constituted an independent ground triggering\n                    the termination provision in cl 3.4. Before addressing the argument, I\n                    pause to make two preliminary observations. First, in light of my finding on the\n                    first ground in favour of Marashi, the latter need only provide satisfactory\n                    evidence of the share cancellation and issuance which was carried out, and not\n                    of a share transfer which never occurred. Second, I discerned some confusion in\n                    the arguments on the evidential burden of proof. It must be remembered that\n                    Marashi’s contractual obligation to provide satisfactory evidence was\n                    entirely distinct from the legal burden of proof which in this case fell on\n                    Indulge, who asserted and therefore had to prove that Marashi was in breach of\n                    cl 3.4. 14     I began the discussion in my oral judgment\n                    with the scope of Indulge’s alleged discretion to reject the evidence that\n                    Marashi provided to prove the occurrence of the transfer of Nate Corp shares. By\n                    requiring Marashi to provide evidence “to the satisfaction of\n                    Indulge”, cl 3.4 clearly conferred a discretion on Indulge’s\n                    part in deciding whether or not to accept Marashi’s evidence. At the same\n                    time, it was also clear that Indulge’s discretion was not so unfettered as\n                    to allow it to arbitrarily change or determine the parties’ contractual\n                    relations at will by the mere expedient of rejecting Marashi’s evidence,\n                    and in the absence of explicit language to that effect, I was reluctant to find\n                    that the parties intended to create such an outcome. The contractual discretion\n                    in cl 3.4 was conferred for a specific purpose,vizto satisfy Indulge that the transfer of Nate Corp shares had\n                    taken place, and in the absence of any contrary language it must be the\n                    parties’ intention, and I so held, that the discretion ought to be\n                    exercised ingood faithfor this purpose and this\n                    purpose only (seeStraits Advisors Pte Ltd v Behringer\n                        Holdings (Pte) Ltd[2009] SGCA 55 at [18]). 15     In addition, as the contractual discretion wasancillary to a defined and objective purpose,\n                    it must also be exercisedreasonably. Accordingly,\n                    Indulge’s discretion to reject Marashi’s evidence of the share\n                    transfer, which was ancillary to the objective purpose of making Euoro the\n                    controlling shareholder of Nate Corp, must be exercisedin\n                        good faithandreasonably. 16     I turn now to Ms Nithi’s criticisms\n                    of the evidence provided by Marashi. The bulk of her arguments focussed on the\n                    documentary evidence provided by Marashi to Indulge, which included copies of\n                    documents purporting to be Nate Corp’s share certificates, minutes of Nate\n                    Corp’s board meetings, and a record of shares issued by Nate Corp. I\n                    agreed with Ms Nithi that the quality of those documents was sloppy. Key\n                    information, such as parties’ names, was recorded in almost illegible\n                    handwriting. Furthermore, the quality of photocopying was poor, and it was\n                    impossible to say with any degree of confidence that the documents were what\n                    they purported to be. However, besides objecting to the quality of the documents\n                    and their reproductions, Ms Nithi did not explain what other documents\n                    could Marashi have provided to show that the relevant transactions had taken\n                    place. Her omission was not surprising since the same question was earlier asked\n                    by Marashi’s then solicitors. 17     In any case, I was of the view that, on the\n                    facts, it was neither necessary nor sufficient for Marashi to provide the\n                    documentary evidence in question. This was because the matter sought to be\n                    proven under cl 3.4 was the legal efficacy of a transaction,vizthe share transfer, which was obviously governed by\n                    Californian law. The production of documentary evidence itself without a legal\n                    opinion would not be sufficient assurance that the documents provided were\n                    legally efficacious. What was needed was a legal opinion on the matter by a\n                    qualified person. In that connection, the material evidence produced were two\n                    emails from one Robert L Shepard, which Marashi forwarded to Indulge. In the\n                    first email, Mr Shepard wrote, in response to an email query by\n                    Panchatsharam Elumalai (“Panju”), who was appointed by Indulge to\n                    deal with matters of finance and administration in Euoro, that: The United States, loving to be different from the rest of the world, does\n                        not really have an equivalent to a Registry of Companies. Unless a US\n                        company is publicly traded on a stock exchange, who the shareholders are is\n                        private information.So there is no government official\n                            record of who owns any number of outstanding shares, etc.\n                        With the corporate records is kept a stock ledger. Mr. Marashi should\n                        have the one for Nate Corporation, it was in a large binder with a hard\n                        cardboard sleeve. That ledger is maintained by the corporate chief financial\n                        officer to track the shares, etc. If this document is lost it is something I\n                        can recreate…[note: 3][emphasis added] The second email did not include any history. In that email,\n                    Mr Shepard wrote: Mr. Marashi, I received your faxed signature, so yes, that completes\n                        the transaction [iethe cancellation of\n                        Marashi’s Nate Corp shares] andas of this moment\n                            all outstanding shares of Nate Corporation are owned by EUORO\n                            International. You as an individual no longer have any direct\n                        ownership of Nate. You are still their sole board member, but now EUORO can\n                        elect a new board member or increase the size of the board at any time. You\n                        indicated to me that you needed a statement that the transfer was complete,so you or any third party may rely on my statement\n                            that under California law Nate Corporation is wholly owned by EUORO\n                            International. Should you require anything further, please do\n                        not hesitate to call or email.[note: 4][emphasis added] The signature line in both emails included the phrase “The Law\n                    Office of Robert L. Shepard”, a Californian address, and a website. The\n                    website stated that Mr Shepard was licensed to practise before the\n                    Californian Supreme Court, among other jurisdictions, and that his areas of\n                    practice included, among other things, business entities. 18     Read together, Mr Shepard’s emails\n                    confirmed that (i) there were no official records of Nate Corp’s\n                    shareholding, and (ii) Euoro was the sole shareholder of Nate Corp. In my\n                    judgment, in the absence of any contrary evidence, Mr Shepard’s\n                    emails represented reliable legal opinions and, as such, obviated the need to\n                    depend on the primary documents as effecting and evidencing the share\n                    transactions. In my view, Mr Shepard’s two emails formed the crucial\n                    part of the evidence provided by Marashi, and consequently Indulge’s\n                    reasons for being dissatisfied with Mr Shepard’s emails must now be\n                    examined. As an aside, Mr Shepard was also the company secretary of Nate\n                    Corp and he was someone Panju on behalf of Euoro had communicated\n                with. 19     First, Ms Nithi argued that the emails\n                    were hearsay evidence. That contention was misconceived. On the facts, the\n                    hearsay rule would operate if Mr Shepard’s emails were adduced as\n                    evidence of the share transactions; but they were not. The issue was not whether\n                    the share transactions occurred but whether the documents provided by Marashi,\n                    including Mr Shepard’s emails, were sufficient to meet\n                    Marashi’s contractual obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the\n                    share transactions. 20     Second, Indulge further complained that the\n                    emails were sent from a Yahoo email account and the website in the signature\n                    line appeared to be that of an estate planner. I did not think the objection\n                    could be taken seriously. There was no reason why legal opinions or advice could\n                    not be rendered by email if the author chose that mode of communication. The\n                    domain of the email account was clearly irrelevant. What was relevant was the\n                    language used by Mr Shepard and the fact that he signed off in his\n                    professional capacity as a qualified lawyer, both of which left no doubt as to\n                    the seriousness with which he communicated the advice. The objection based on\n                    the name of the webpage was clearly frivolous – a quick perusal of the\n                    webpage disclosed Mr Shepard’s legal qualifications. In fact, I\n                    regarded as telling the fact that Indulge did not make any sustained attack as\n                    to the existence or professional qualifications of Mr Shepard. Indeed, I\n                    did not think that it could have credibly done so – there were emails\n                    showing that Panju, who as mentioned was installed by Indulge in Euoro, dealt\n                    with Mr Shepard in his professional capacity as a lawyer on the Nate Corp\n                        shares.[note: 5] 21     Third, Indulge argued that the emails did not\n                    confirm that the issuance of new shares to Euoro and/or the cancellation of\n                    Marashi’s shares were validly carried out. The objection was misconceived\n                    since the second email did confirm that Euoro was thesoleshareholder of Nate Corp, which by any measure achieved the\n                    result required by cl 3.4 on its true construction. 22     Four, Indulge made the point that the emails\n                    did not constitute legal opinion or advice directed to it. There was no merit in\n                    the contention. Either Euoro was the sole shareholder of Nate Corp, or it was\n                    not – the answer could not be dependent on the intended recipient. In any\n                    case, Mr Shepard’s second email made clear that he gave his opinion\n                    intending that a third party such as Indulge could rely on it. 23     Five, Indulge took issue with\n                    Mr Shepard’s statement that he would be able to recreate the stock\n                    ledger and other corporate documents, arguing that this proposed course of\n                    action threw doubts on the authenticity of the Nate Corp documents. Since I did\n                    not take into account the documentary evidence provided by Marashi, the\n                    objection was irrelevant. In the absence of cogent evidence on the impropriety\n                    of Mr Shepard’s proposed course of action it was also inappropriate\n                    to entertain any discussion of Mr Shepard’sbona\n                        fides. 24     Finally, Indulge did not provide Marashi with\n                    any indication of what evidence would satisfy it that the relevant share\n                    transactions were carried out. As far as I could see, Indulge’s\n                    objections, discussed above, were nothing more thanex post\n                        factojustifications advanced for the purposes of litigation.\n                    There was no contemporaneous evidence that the objections were contemplated, let\n                    alone communicated to Marashi at the time the evidence was tendered to\n                    it. 25     For the reasons stated, I concluded that\n                    Indulge’s grounds for rejecting Mr. Shepard’s emails were\n                    unreasonable and hence invalid for the purposes of cl 3.4. Separately, and\n                    although it was not raised by Mr Kumar, it was also arguable, as a matter\n                    of construction, that Marashi’s failure to provide satisfactory evidence\n                    of the share transfer would not have triggered the termination provision in\n                    cl 3.4. To recapitulate, Marashi was obligated to provide satisfactory\n                    evidence of “the fulfilment of the condition as set out in this\n                    Clause and Clause 3.1(g)”, where “the condition as set\n                    out in this Clause” must necessarily refer to the obligation to transfer\n                    shares. The trigger for the termination provision was similarly worded –\n                    the provision was triggered if Euoro and/or Marashi “fail to satisfy this\n                    Clause and Clause 3.1(g)”. Reference to “this\n                    Clause” in the termination provision ought to be readejusdem generiswith the further reference to\n                    “Clause 3.1(g)”, which was a purely substantive condition\n                    that Euoro, amongst other things, was to own 70% of Nate Corp’s shares.\n                    The obligation to provide satisfactory evidence of the fulfilment of\n                    cl 3.1(g) was separately set out in cl 3.2, which was not referred to\n                    in the termination provision. In addition, the share transfer was not an urgent\n                    or otherwise time-sensitive transaction, a fact which might have supported an\n                    interpretation requiring the timely provision of evidence on pain of\n                    termination. In fact, cl 7.2 made it clear that the global expansion plans\n                    of the parties, for which foreign subsidiaries such as Nate Corp, a shell\n                    company, would be needed, would only kick in later in the process. At the very\n                    least, the text of cl 3.4 was sufficiently ambiguous and ought therefore to\n                    be construedcontra proferentumwhich in this case\n                    meant against Indulge since its own solicitors prepared the draft on which the\n                    final form of the Subscription Agreement was based. 26     Before moving on, I should comment on\n                    Ms Nithi’s cross-examination of Marashi on various allegations of\n                    mismanagement by Marashi, in an apparent attempt to show that Indulge was not\n                    acting in bad faith when it raised these allegations with him in the course of\n                    the parties’ dealings and, by an apparently logical extension, that\n                    Indulge was also acting in good faith when it rejected Marashi’s evidence\n                    of the share transfer. I did not think that that line of cross-examination was\n                    relevant at all – Indulge could not reject Marashi’s evidence of the\n                    share transfer for extraneous reasons, and that included even legitimate\n                    concerns about Marashi’s management of the business, which would give rise\n                    to separate causes of action.",
        "Sutti Corp’s cancellation of its Nate Corp shares": "27     I now turn to Ms Nithi’s third\n                    argument that there was a failure of an implied condition that Sutti Corp was to\n                    remain as a 30% shareholder of Nate Corp, and that failure entitled Indulge to\n                    terminate the Subscription Agreement pursuant to the termination provision in\n                    cl 3.4. As mentioned, it was not disputed that Sutti Corp had voluntarily\n                    returned for cancellation its shares in Nate Corp before the third tranche fell\n                    due. 28     The test for implying a term in fact was\n                    rationalised inForefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v\n                        Modern Pak Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927. In that case,\n                    Andrew Phang Boon Leong J (as he then was) concluded after a review of the\n                    authorities that a term would be implied in fact if it satisfied the business\n                    efficacy test, applied through the mode of the officious bystander test. Phang\n                    J’s rationalisation was approved by the Court of Appeal in Ng Giap Hon v\n                    Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd [2009] 3 SLR(R) 518. 29     Indulge had not persuaded me, on the evidence,\n                    that Sutti’s continued involvement as a shareholder in Nate Corp was so\n                    obviously necessary for the business efficacy of the Subscription Agreement that\n                    such a term would be implied as a fact. From a textual point of view, the\n                    Subscription Agreement referred to and imposed obligations in relation to the\n                    existing and desired shareholding in Nate Corp at several points (seeegcll 3.1(g), 3.4, and 5.2(a)). That indicated\n                    that the issue of Nate Corp’s shareholding was consciously within the\n                    parties’ contemplation when they entered into the Subscription Agreement,\n                    and that the parties considered it necessary to express their intentions in that\n                    regard. In the circumstances, it was difficult to imagine that the parties would\n                    fail to expressly provide for Sutti Corp’s continued involvement as a\n                    shareholder in Nate Corp, if indeed they felt that such involvement was\n                    necessary for the business efficacy of the Subscription Agreement. This was\n                    Mr Kumar’s point which I accepted. 30     The textual analysis of the parties’\n                    intention was fortified by a consideration of the parties’ commercial\n                    objectives and the role Sutti Corp could have played in achieving these\n                    objectives. From the evidence, it seemed that Sutti Corp, with its extensive\n                    health food distribution network in the United States of America\n                    (“USA”), was viewed as playing an important role in the\n                    contemplated introduction of Euoro’s products into the USA. However, while\n                    it was arguablydesirableandconvenientfor Euoro to have a USA partner such as Sutti Corp in\n                    the future, that argument did not show that Sutti Corp’s continued\n                    involvement in a shell company was anecessaryterm of the investment, and there was no contemporaneous evidence of that. It\n                    must be remembered that Nate Corp was a shell company and the indefinite\n                    involvement of Sutti Corp in a dormant shell company was something that ought to\n                    have been (but was not) discussed and agreed upon if it was important to the\n                    investment for Euoro to break into the USA market (or any subset thereof) with\n                    Sutti Corp’s involvement. 31     There was one other point. Clause 3.4\n                    expressly provided for the termination of the tripartite agreement in specific\n                    situations. Any other situation that could have triggered the termination\n                    provision that was not expressly spelled out by the parties must, as a matter of\n                    construction, fall outside of the scope of the right to terminate. Even if the\n                    failure of Sutti Corp to remain a 30% shareholder of Nate Corp was an implied\n                    term, it could not trigger theexpresstermination\n                    provision in cl 3.4. 32     In conclusion, for the reasons given, I found\n                    and held that Marashi was not in breach of the conditions precedent to the\n                    payment of the third tranche. Accordingly, I dismissed Indulge’s claim\n                    against Marashi as pleaded in the Statement of Claim.",
        "Marashi’s counterclaim for the payment of the third and fourth\n                tranches": "33     I now come to Marashi’s counterclaim for\n                    the third and fourth tranches. It was pointed out in my oral judgment that a\n                    dismissal of Indulge’s claim did not automatically lead to judgment in\n                    Marashi’s favour on his counterclaim. It would have been evident from the\n                    various issues raised by this court after the trial that there were pertinent\n                    and difficult obstacles to overcome, both in procedural and substantive\n                    law. 34     The most immediate procedural problem faced by\n                    Marashi in his counterclaim was that Euoro, to whom the third and fourth\n                    tranches were to be paid, was not made a party to the present proceedings. Euoro\n                    was a party to the Subscription Agreement and would havelocus standito sue to enforce its own rights. I noticed that\n                    there was an early application by Marashi to join Euoro, pursuant to directions\n                    given by the Assistant Registrar. The application to join Euoro was heard\n                    together with applications filed by both parties for summary judgment. The\n                    Assistant Registrar hearing the applications allowed Indulge’s application\n                    for summary judgment, dismissed Marashi’s application for summary\n                    judgment, and made no order on Marashi’s application to join Euoro.\n                    Marashi appealed to Choo Han Teck J and successfully obtained unconditional\n                    leave to defend Indulge’s action. However, Marashi did not appeal against\n                    the “no order” made on its earlier application to join Euoro. In\n                    short, there was no subsequent attempt to join Euoro. Mr Kumar did not\n                    provide any explanation as to that state of affairs when I directed parties to\n                    explain and submit on the absence of Euoro in these proceedings.\n                    Mr Kumar’s stance was that there was no need to join Euoro and, if\n                    anything, it was for Indulge to take the initiative to do so. That last\n                    contention was misplaced: it was Marashi and not Euoro who had to return the\n                    first $500,000 to Indulge under cl 3.4, while the next $500,000 was to be\n                    paid to Euoro and not Marashi. Mr Kumar also argued that: (i)     Marashi had the standing to claim\n                        against Indulge for the payment of the third and fourth\n                    tranches; (ii)     the\n                        court could revive Marashi’s original application to join Euoro,\n                        and (iii)     the\n                        court could exercise its discretion under O 15 r 6(2)(b) of the Rules of\n                        Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) to join\n                    Euoro. His arguments were addressed and rejected on 10\n                    December 2009 for the reasons stated below.",
        "Specific performance in favour of third party": "35     Mr Kumar’s first argument that\n                    Marashi could claim specific performance for a third party like Euoro was a\n                    short point that could be dealt with quickly. Marashi confirmed that he had not\n                    suffered any loss from the non-payment of the third and fourth tranches and he\n                    was not seeking any damages from Indulge on the usual principles. It was\n                    therefore necessary for him to proceed on other bases. Mr Kumar’s\n                    argument that Marashi had the proper standing to claim specific performance\n                    against Indulge for Euoro’s benefit was based on cases such asBeswick v Beswick[1968] AC 58 andFamily Food Court v Seah Boon Lock[2008] 4 SLR(R) 272\n                    at [34] (“Family Food Court”), which\n                    operated to alleviate the difficulties caused by the doctrine of privity of\n                    contract. Those decisions were plainly distinguishable from the present case,\n                    where Euoro was privy to the Subscription Agreement and could sue in its own\n                    right, and was unable to do so only because of Marashi’s procedural\n                    omission to join it as a party to the proceedings. I was therefore of the\n                    opinion that Marashi’s counterclaim for specific performance which was\n                    madeon behalf of Euorowas legally unsustainable\n                    and must fail. If Euoro were to recover, it must claimin its\n                        own right. I would add, for completeness, that the same reasons\n                    would also apply to a claim by Marashi for substantial damages on the\n                    “board ground” based onFamily Food\n                        CourtandChia Kok Leong v Prosperland Pte\n                        Ltd[2005] 2 SLR(R) 484 (“Chia Kok Leong v Prosperland”). 36     In addition, for the reasons that I will\n                    elaborate when discussing the result of a claim brought directly by Euoro,\n                    Marashi’s claim for specific performance must also fail because the\n                    requirement of reciprocity needed for such an order was not met (see below,[74]). In determining this requirement\n                    of reciprocity, I considered and concluded that the commercial purpose of the\n                    $1m investment was to expand the business by opening more stores and that\n                    Marashi, as the party seeking specific performance, was himself unable to\n                    perform the terms of the contract on his part – principally his obligation\n                    to use his best endeavours to achieve the business plan of opening more stores\n                    agreed to by the parties- because of the cessation of the floral and herbal tea\n                    business in August 2008. It followed that since Marashi was not able to perform\n                    his part of the contract, he would not be able to obtain specific performance of\n                    it.",
        "Non-joinder of Euoro": "37     In relation to Mr Kumar’s second\n                    argument, I was in entire agreement with Ms Nithi that Marashi’s\n                    original application to join Euoro was determined when the Assistant Registrar\n                    made no order upon it: seeHo Kian Cheong v Ho Kian\n                        Guan[2004] SGHC 104 at [7]. It was for Marashi to\n                    raise the issue on appeal, which he failed to do. 38     In relation to Mr Kumar’s third\n                    argument, I was not persuaded that the court’s discretion to join Euoro\n                    should be exercised. First, this case was not one where no attempt at all to\n                    join Euoro was made. Marashi was aware of the need to join Euoro and indeed an\n                    application was filed on his behalf. Second, there was no appeal against the\n                    Assistant Registrar’s “no order” on the joinder application.\n                    Third, Mr Kumar did not explain, even though he was specifically asked, why\n                    nothing was done after the Assistant Registrar made no order upon\n                    Marashi’s application to join Euoro and following Choo J’s\n                    order granting Marashi unconditional leave to defend Indulge’s claim.\n                    Without any explanation, despite being specifically asked to explain, the court\n                    was left with the impression that the absence of an appeal on joinder was by\n                    choice or an oversight. In the premises, nothing of an extenuating nature and\n                    circumstance was proffered to enable the court to assess whether this was a\n                    proper case to exercise its discretion. I noted Indulge’s objection to the\n                    late joinder for the reason that the conduct of Indulge’s litigation would\n                    have been different with Euoro in the proceedings. Indulge would have pursued\n                    separate claims against Euoro. It would be prejudiced if Euoro were to be joined\n                    at this late stage as Indulge would not have the opportunity to include and\n                    prosecute its separate claims against Euoro. 39     For the reasons stated on the non-joinder as\n                    well as the ruling on the claim for specific performance for a third party like\n                    Euoro, the counterclaim was not sustainable and it was accordingly\n                    dismissed.",
        "The action for an agreed sum": "40     Even if Euoro had been joined in the\n                    proceedings before me, the outcome would still have been the same in that Euoro\n                    would have been unable to recover the third and fourth tranches. If Euoro were\n                    to sue, the claim would be brought in an action for an agreed sum, and not for\n                    specific performance. As mentioned, the parties were directed to submit on the\n                    relevance of Euoro’s cessation of business and its consequent inability to\n                    perform its obligations to expand the business as required under the\n                    Subscription Agreement. The parties’ submissions were outlined at the\n                    beginning of this judgment (see[5]above). 41     Mr Kumar submitted that a party could\n                    always recover a contractually agreed sum once the condition precedent for its\n                    payment had been met. I noted in my oral judgment that this proposition was\n                    incongruent with the more principled position for the specific performance of\n                    non-monetary obligations, and also with the concept of the performance interest,\n                    as applied to the interest of the party liable to pay coupled with his\n                    reasonable expectation of the counterparty’s performance. I also alluded\n                    to the fact that the historical bases for the action for an agreed sum were not\n                    entirely satisfactory, and further doubted that, on the facts, the parties\n                    intended the $1m to be payable independent of the rest of the obligations in the\n                    Subscription Agreement. I now elaborate on those reasons. For the avoidance of\n                    doubt, the modern formulation is referred to in this judgment as an action for\n                    an agreed sum to distinguish it, for the purposes of discussion, from the\n                    ancient action of debt.",
        "The modern formulation": "42     The clearest judicial statement of the action\n                    for an agreed sum in modern times is that of Millett LJ inJervis v Harris[1996] 1 Ch 195 at\n                    202–203: … a debt is a definite sum of money fixed by the agreement of the\n                        parties as payable by one party to the other in return for the performance\n                        of a specified obligation by the other party oron the\n                            occurrence of some specified event or condition; whereas\n                        damages may be claimed from a party who has broken his primary contractual\n                        obligation in some way other than by failure to pay such a debt. The plaintiff who claims payment of a debt need not\n                            prove anything beyond the occurrence of the event or condition on the\n                            occurrence of which the debt became due. He need prove no loss; the\n                            rules as to remoteness of damage and mitigation of loss are\n                            irrelevant; and unless the event on which the payment is due\n                        is a breach of some other contractual obligation owed by the one party to\n                        the other the law on penalties does not apply to the agreed sum. It is not\n                        necessary that the amount of the debt should be ascertained at the date of\n                        the contract; it is sufficient if it is ascertainable when payment is\n                        due. [emphasis added] 43     Millett LJ did not cite any case law (he\n                    cited the learned authors ofChitty on Contracts,\n                    Vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell, 27thEd, 1994), at\n                    para 21-031), and the quoted passage was strictly speakingobiter dicta. However, the essence of thegeneralformulation is well recognised (seeChitty on Contracts, Vol 1 (Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        30thEd, 2008), at paras 21-040 and 26-009\n                        (“Chitty”);Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol 9(1) (Butterworths,\n                        4thEd Reissue, 1998) at para 942\n                        (“Halsbury’s”); JW Carter\n                    & DJ Harland,Contract Law in Australia,\n                    (LexisNexis Butterworths, 4thEd, 2002) at\n                    paras 2201–2206 (“Contract Law in\n                        Australia”)). 44     In any case a direct authority is to be found\n                    inMattock, Executor of Southwood v Kinglake(1839) 10 Ad & E 50. In that case, K agreed to pay S on a fixed\n                    day, and in exchange S agreed to convey certain properties to K. In the event, S\n                    did not convey and K did not pay, and S’s executor M brought an action of\n                    debt to recover the payment. All four judges of the Queen’s Bench allowed\n                    the action. The judgment of Littledale J (at 56) is particularly relevant\n                    for present purposes. The learned judge held: A time being fixed for payment, and none for doing that which was the\n                        consideration for the payment, an action lies for the purchase-money without\n                        averring performance of the consideration. An action for not executing a\n                        conveyance of the premises might have been maintained by the defendant\n                        before the day of payment and in such action no allegation of payment would\n                        have been necessary. The covenants are independent, and each party has\n                        relied upon his remedy by action against the other. Mattock v Kinglakewas cited with\n                    approval by Lord Alverstone CJ inWorkman, Clark & Co.\n                        Limited v Lloyd Barzileno[1908] 1 KB 968 at\n                    976–977. The dispute in the latter case is not material for present\n                    purposes. 45     Furthermore, if the payment has fallen due, it\n                    is an accrued right which survives a termination of the contract as a result of\n                    an accepted repudiation (seeChitty,[43]above at para 24-051;Halsbury’s,[43],\n                    above, vol 9(1) at para 1003;Contract Law in\n                        Australia,[43]above at\n                    paras 2225–2226.)",
        "The historical bases of the action": "46     From a necessarily rough survey of the\n                    histories and historical sources, set out below, it seems that the present form\n                    of the action for an agreed sum is most clearly correlated with three historical\n                    doctrines: (i) the proprietary conceptions underlying the ancient action of\n                    debt; (ii) the juristic basis of theindebitatus\n                        assumpsitaction as an action on a separate undertaking; and\n                    (iii) the doctrine of independent promises. 47     I begin with the action of debt. The wrong\n                    complained of in an action of debt was the defendant’s misfeasance of\n                    wrongfully detaining something which he owed to the plaintiff (debet et detinet), and not, as we would nowadays think\n                    of it, the nonfeasance of breaching an obligation to do something. In other\n                    words, the action was tied to quasi-proprietary concepts. It was not restricted\n                    to moneys owed, or to contractual obligations; it could be brought for chattels\n                    wrongfully detained, and for non-contractual obligations to pay money. In time,\n                    debt for chattels evolved into the separate action of detinue, while debt for\n                    non-contractual obligations to pay money continued to be available even today,\n                    where we speak of debts created by deed, by statute, by judgment, and so on. For\n                    the history of the action of debt, see generally, Oliver Wendell Holmes,The Common Law(Little, Brown and Company,\n                        51stEd, 1881) (Lecture VII,\n                    “Contract”) at pp 251–252; JB Ames, “Parol\n                    Contracts Prior to Assumpsit” (1894) 8 Harv L Rev 252 at p 260;\n                    Sir Frederick Pollock and Frederic William Maitland,The\n                        History of English Law before the Time of Edward I, (Reissue)\n                    Vol 2 (Cambridge University Press, 2ndEd,\n                    1968), at pp 204–205; AWB Simpson,A History of\n                        the Common Law of Contract: The Rise of the Action of Assumpsit(Clarendon Press, 1987) at pp 76–77 and 79–80. 48     The notion of an action of debt as involving\n                    the recovery of something owed by the defendant to the plaintiff explains\n                    several characteristics of the action. It explains why debt laid only for a sum\n                    certain. It explains why a debt is recoverable in full without the need to prove\n                    and quantify loss. It explains why an accrued debt is recoverable\n                    notwithstanding the termination of the contract. As Dixon and Evatt JJ\n                    explained inWestralian Farmers Ltd v Commonwealth\n                        Agricultural Service Engineers Ltd(1936) 54 CLR 361 at\n                    379–80, the action is brought upon “a debt, a distinct chose in\n                    action which for many purposes is conceived as possessing proprietary\n                    characteristics.” 49     In time, the action ofassumpsit, specificallyindebitatus\n                        assumpsitcame to overshadow the action of debt. The expansion ofindebitatus assumpsitculminated inSlade’s Case(1602) 4 Co Rep 92b, where\n                    it was resolved by all the Justices of England and the Barons of the Exchequer\n                    thatindebitatus assumpsitlaid concurrently with\n                    debt (with a few exceptions that are immaterial for present purposes). That\n                    resolution, together with other developments, established a general promissory\n                    action which was eventually to give rise to the modern law of contract. It was\n                    also resolved in the same case (at 94b) that: the plaintiff in [an] action on the case on assumpsit should not recover\n                        only damages for the special loss (if any be) which he had, but alsofor the whole debt, so that a recovery in this action\n                            should be a good bar in an action of debt brought upon the same\n                            contract. So vice versa ..[emphasis added] The passage above made clear that a debt continued to be recoverable\n                    as such, notwithstanding that the action was brought inassumpsit, which generally sounded in damages to be assessed\n                    (see Simpson, above[47]at p 309; and\n                    DJ Ibbetson,A Historical Introduction to the Law of\n                        Obligations(Oxford University Press, 1999) at\n                    pp 132–133, 147–149, and 151). 50     A claim inindebitatus\n                        assumpsitbasically alleged that the defendant, being indebted\n                        (indebitatus), undertook to pay (assumpsit solvere) (see Simpson, above[47]at p 309). The action was thus based on\n                    an undertaking separate from the promise which created the debt, and this\n                    remained so even afterSlade’s Case–\n                    the third resolution in that case (at 94a–94b) was that “that every\n                    contract executory imports in itself anassumpsit”, a formulation which made clear that theassumpsitwas distinct from the contract. Consequently,\n                    theassumpsitor undertaking could be sued upon\n                    separately from the rest of the agreement. Thus, inTurner v\n                        Bladin(1951) 82 CLR 463 (“Turner v Bladin”) at [14], the High Court of Australia\n                    held that an action to recover sums due under an agreement to sell land was not\n                    an action on the agreement but an action ofindebitatus\n                        assumpsit, and was therefore not caught by the New South Wales\n                    equivalent of s 4 of the Statute of Frauds 1677 (c 3) (our equivalent is\n                    contained in s 5(d) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed)). In\n                    this connection, theassumpsitregime was\n                    diametrically different from an action of debt on a simple contract (as opposed\n                    to a specialty contract), which laid only upon aquid pro\n                        quo,vizan agreed benefit actually\n                    conferred by the plaintiff (see SJ Stoljar,A History of\n                        Contract at Common Law(Australian National University Press,\n                    1975) at p 11;Young v Queensland Trustees\n                        Ltd(1956) 99 CLR 560 at [11]). 51     I come finally to the doctrine of independent\n                    promises. It is unnecessary to trace the development of the doctrine here (for\n                    an account see SJ Stoljar, “Dependent and Independent Promises: A Study\n                    in the History of Contract” (1956–1958) 2(2) Syd L Rev 217). The\n                    doctrine was distilled into five separate rules by Sergeant-at-law John Williams\n                    in his notes toPordage v Cole(1669) 85 ER 449\n                        (“Pordage v Cole”) at\n                    450–454, which were in turn treated extensively by Sir Thomas Willes\n                    Chitty KC, Alfred Thompson Denning (as he then was) and Cyril Pearce Harvey, the\n                    editors ofSmith, A Selection of Leading Cases on Various\n                        Branches of the Law(Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        13thEd, 1929) at p 10. For present purposes\n                    it is sufficient to set out Professor Stoljar’s summary (at\n                    pp 245–246) of the Sergeant’s five rules: (1) if the date of payment is to, or may, happen before the other’s\n                        performance, the payor’s promise is independent, i.e. [the] actor can\n                        claim payment without having to aver performance; (2) if such payment is\n                        appointed after performance, the payor’s promise is subject to a\n                        condition whose fulfilment [the] actor has to aver; (3) if a covenant goes\n                        only to part of the consideration, it is independent so that [the] plaintiff\n                        may maintain an action without, averring performance, but (4) if mutual\n                        covenants go to the whole consideration, they are mutual conditions and must\n                        be averred, and (5) if two acts are to be done at the same time, neither\n                        party can maintain an action without showing performance or an offer to\n                        perform. It is readily apparent that a strict application of Sergeant\n                    Williams’ rule (1) will yield the result that obligations which arise at\n                    different times or on different conditions will be actionable independently of\n                    each other.Pordage v Cole, on which rule (1) is\n                    based, is still regarded as good law byChitty,\n                    above,[43]at paras 24-035 to\n                    24-037.",
        "Rationalising the action": "52     It is plain that these historical doctrines\n                    cannot stand today as convincing rationales for the action for an agreed sum. An\n                    action for an agreed sum is an action to directly enforce a contractual promise.\n                    It is not an action to assert or protect property in a thing. It is not an\n                    action on a fictional undertaking subsequent to, or otherwise distinct from, the\n                    contract which contains the promise to pay. And while the doctrine of\n                    independent promises as restated in Sergeant Williams’ rule (1) may have,\n                    in its time, played an important role in expanding the scope ofassumpsitinto executory contracts (which were not\n                    actionable in debt because of the requirement forquid pro\n                        quo), it is an anachronistic exception to the modern law of\n                    contract, which no longer views a contractual term literally and in isolation,\n                    but rather approaches it in light of the contract as a whole and the underlying\n                    commercial and business purpose of the parties in entering into the contract\n                    (seeZurich Insurance(above[9]) at [131], followed inTiger\n                        Airways Pte Ltd v Swissport Singapore Pte Ltd[2009]\n                    4 SLR(R) 992 at [25]). AsChittyremarked (above,[43]at para 24-036),\n                    cases involving independent promises are “exceptional”. I agree,\n                    and add that Sergeant Williams’ rule (1), if it continues to be a rule at\n                    all, cannot be immutable, but must instead yield to an approach which better\n                    reflects the parties’ commercial intentions and expectations as\n                    objectively expressed or ascertained in the contract. 53     Specifically, it is far from obvious to me\n                    that a contractual promise to pay money is necessarily enforceable once its\n                    conditions precedent have been met, without regard to the rest of the contract.\n                    Certainly, such an approach would not be congruent with the position in relation\n                    to the grant of specific performance of non-monetary obligations, which is\n                    subject to the condition described as follows in G R Northcote,Fry on Specific Performance, (Stevan & Sons,\n                        6thEd, 1921), Chapter XX at p 435,\n                    §922: With regard to the matters to be done by the plaintiff according to the\n                        terms of the contract, it is, from obvious principles of justice, incumbent\n                        on him, when he seeks the performance of the contract, to show, first, that\n                        he has performed or been ready and willing to perform, the terms of the\n                        contract on his part to be then performed; and secondly, that he is ready\n                        and willing to do all matters and things on his part thereafter to be done;\n                        and a default on his part in either of these respects furnishes a ground\n                        upon which the action may be resisted. Sir Edward Fry refers to this requirement by the unwieldy name of\n                    “default on the part of the plaintiff”; I prefer the label\n                    “reciprocity”, which more aptly captures the mutual and dependent\n                    nature of the several obligations which constitutes a contract. 54     The requirement as stated by Sir Edward Fry is\n                    commonly viewed as a specific expression of the related equitable doctrines that\n                    he who comes to equity must come with clean hands, and must also do equity. But\n                    it seems to me that the requirement of reciprocity can – and should\n                    – be divorced from the equitable concepts of conscience and discretion and\n                    rationalised in accordance with the principles of contract. Specifically, the\n                    requirement of reciprocity as a principle of contract law recognises that, when\n                    the several obligations of a contract areon their true\n                        constructionpart of one indivisible bargain, a party cannot\n                    expect to enforce his counterparty’s obligations when he himself did not,\n                    cannot, or is unwilling or able to, perform his own obligations. In other words,\n                    it prevents the plaintiff from recovering the covenanted benefit free from the\n                    covenanted burden. It ensures that the whole bargain is recovered, the good with\n                    the bad, no less, and certainly no more. This is certainly a principle that\n                    applies with equal force to the enforcement of monetary as well as non-monetary\n                    primary obligations. 55     In my view, the requirement of reciprocity can\n                    also be said to be consistent with, and in fact to flow from, the modern and\n                    developing concept of the performance interest. As recently defined by the Court\n                    of Appeal inFamily Food Court(above,[35]at [34] of the report), the performance\n                    interest is “the plaintiff/promisee’s interest in the contract\n                    being performed and (consequently) his receiving the benefit which he had\n                    contracted for”. 56     The concept of the performance interest has\n                    been applied to found the “broad ground” on which a party can\n                    recover substantial damages for a breach of contract notwithstanding the fact\n                    that he has not thereby suffered actual loss (seeChia Kok\n                        Leong v Prosperland(above,[35]) and the English authorities reviewed there). While this\n                    application of the concept is not pertinent to the present case, it must be\n                    borne in mind that theconceptof the performance\n                    interest is a wide one: the Court of Appeal inFamily Food\n                        Court(above,[35]at [34]\n                    and [48]) described it as “an integral part of the\n                        common law of contract” (emphasis added). 57     In my judgment, the most fundamental sense in\n                    which a party is interested in the performance of his counterparty is that such\n                    performance constitutes thequidin return for\n                    which he undertook to render thequo. To enforce\n                    thequowhen thequidhas not or will not be rendered is to ignore thequid pro quobasis on which the parties assumed their\n                    mutual obligations. Therefore, in order for the performance interest to be fully\n                    protected, it cannot only operate as a sword to found a claim for specific\n                    performance or substantial damages against a party in breach – it must be\n                    capable of operating as a shield for a party to resist performance when the\n                    counterparty did not, cannot, or will not, render performance,iewhen there is a lack of reciprocity. Once again, this\n                    applies equally to the enforcement of non-monetary primary obligations, where\n                    reciprocity already applies, as well as to monetary primary obligations, where\n                    reciprocity should also be applicable. 58     Put in another way, the rationale underlying\n                    the requirement of reciprocity can be met by two possible remedial responses.\n                    Where there exists an effective and adequate counterclaim, it is for the party\n                    to bring a counterclaim against his counterparty for the appropriate remedy.\n                    Such a counterclaim may take the form of specific performance, which is,\n                    provided that any loss caused by the delayed performance is adequately\n                    remediable by damages, a perfect substitute for the counterparty’s failure\n                    to perform in the past or unwillingness or inability to perform in the future.\n                    It may also take the form of substantive damages, if such damages are an\n                    adequate substitute for the counterparty’s performance. The requirement to\n                    bring a counterclaim in such situations strikes an appropriate balance between\n                    the performance interests of the party and the counterparty – the party\n                    will not be deprived of the counterparty’s performance if he (the party)\n                    is susceptible to a counterclaim that will adequately meet the\n                    counterparty’s performance interest. This is, to my mind, the better\n                    justification for the result inMattock v Kinglake(above,[44]) – K, who was liable to\n                    pay, could bring an action against S for the conveyance which was promised in\n                    return. However, it is not in every case that a party’s performance\n                    interest can be adequately vindicated by a counterclaim, and in such cases the\n                    law ought to afford him a full defence against performing. This defence\n                    recognises that a party should not be liable to perform when he has not received\n                    what he has bargained for or an adequate substitute. The converse result –\n                    requiring a party to perform when he has not received what he has bargained for\n                    or an adequate substitute – would be entirely inconsistent with the\n                    parties’ reasonable commercial expectations. 59     Here it is apposite to note that the concept\n                    that a party can refuse to perform on the grounds that the other party has not\n                    performed, or is unwilling or unable to perform, is hardly novel to the law of\n                    contract. It is the basis of the related common law doctrines of repudiatory\n                    breach and anticipatory breach, the origins of which can be traced back to Lord\n                    Mansfield’s judgment inBoone v Eyre(1789)\n                    1 H Bl 273 (see the references to that case inHong Kong Fir Shipping Co Ltd v Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd[1962]\n                    2 QB 26, which is the modern point of departure) and Lord Campbell\n                    CJ’s judgment inHochster v De La Tour(1853) 118 ER 922 respectively. The requirement of reciprocity as it\n                    applies to specific performance in equity is equally venerable (see the\n                    authorities collected inFry on Specific\n                        Performance, above,[53]at\n                    §922ff). While each doctrine has its distinct scope of application, they all\n                    spring from the commonsensical recognition, mentioned earlier at[54]and[57],\n                    that when the several obligations of a contract areon their\n                        true constructionpart of one indivisible bargain, it is\n                    inconsistent both with principle and with the parties’ intentions to\n                    insist that one party perform when the other did not, cannot or will not do\n                    so. 60     I now come to the scope of, and the exceptions\n                    to, the reciprocity requirement. No question of reciprocity will arise in cases\n                    where the contract has been fully executed on one side – the requirement\n                    is necessarily satisfied in such cases. An example is a simple credit\n                    relationship where the creditor has fully executed his obligation to extend the\n                    credit, with the debtor’s obligation to repay being the only obligation\n                    outstanding in the contract. The requirement of reciprocity is in practice\n                    concerned with situations where each side has breached the contract and/or has\n                    obligations to perform in the future. 61     There are two commonsensical exceptions to the\n                    requirement of reciprocity. The first exception is that a defendant cannot\n                    insist on reciprocity to the extent that the lack of it is caused by him (seeFry on Specific Performance, above, [53] at\n                    p 442, §941). In other words, a defendant cannot insist on his performance\n                    interest when he has himself defeated it. The second exception is that a breach\n                    which does not go to the root of the contractmaynot constitute sufficient grounds for resisting performance or payment. This is\n                    consistent with the position for the specific performance of non-monetary\n                    remedies (see Spry,The Principles of Equitable\n                        Remedies(Sweet & Maxwell, 7thEd,\n                    2007) at 213–214). The second exception essentially balances the gravity\n                    of the performance interests at stake. 62     Before turning to the facts, I must add, for\n                    the avoidance of doubt, that everything I have said above is directed at the\n                    direct enforcement, at common law, of primary contractual obligations to pay\n                    money. It is not directed at non-contractual obligations to pay money, secondary\n                    obligations to pay damages, and statutes such as the Sale of Goods Act\n                    (Cap 393, 1999 Rev Ed). In those cases it might well be appropriate\n                    for the action of debt to apply strictly. In the case of statutory provisions,\n                    it should also be borne in mind that they might have been enacted with reference\n                    to the common law as it stood at the time of enactment, and might need to be\n                    interpreted in like manner (seeegthe\n                    interpretation of the New South Wales equivalent of the Statute of Frauds inTurner v Bladin, discussed at above,[50]). Separately, given my view of the facts, I\n                    have not found it necessary to decide whether the right to sue on a primary\n                    obligation to pay an agreed sum survives a termination of the contract. Suffice\n                    it to say that the juridical basis of that rule merits serious reconsideration\n                    in an appropriate case in the future.",

It was a view which Marashi and Euoro correctly\n                    maintained in their solicitors’ letter of 4 May 2007 which expressly\n                    held Indulge to its (Indulge’s) obligations under the Subscription\n                        Agreement.[note: 6]At all\n                    material times, the Subscription Agreement remained fully in\n                force. 64     The relevant provision is cl 7.2 of the\n                    Subscription Agreement and the material part of cl 7.2 provides as\n                    follows: The parties agree that each of them will use their best endeavours to\n                        ensure the continued growth of revenues of [Euoro] in Singapore in the first\n                        phase in accordance with the business plan in Annex A ...

As cl 7.2 was a “best endeavours” clause, Marashi had\n                    to show that he had taken all reasonable steps which a prudent and determined\n                    person acting in his own interests and anxious to perform cl 7.2 would have\n                    taken (seeTravista Development Pte Ltd v Tan Kim Swee\n                        Augustine and others[2008] 2 SLR(R) 474 at [22]).\n                    Notably Marashi admitted during cross-examination that Euoro and he were bound\n                    to open new herbal stores and stores-in-stores under the Subscription\n                        Agreement.[note: 8]There was also the unchallenged\n                    evidence of Sajen G Aswani, a director of Indulge, who was also appointed to\n                    Euoro’s board pursuant to cl 8(b), that the money invested in Euoro\n                    was to be used to fund its expansion to create sales.[note: 9]The parties thus accepted that the $1m\n                    was earmarked for the envisaged expansion and specifically that Euoro through\n                    Marashi had to take reasonable steps to open within the time frame the number of\n                    stores that were to be opened. 65     There was no evidence to show that Euoro\n                    through Marashi had used its best endeavours. In fact, it was clear on the\n                    evidence that the first two tranches were not being applied towards the opening\n                    of new stores. In fact, no new stores were opened – Marashi contended that\n                    two or three stores-in-stores were in fact opened,[note: 10]but that contention was contradicted by Marashi’s admission that there was\n                    one store and five stores-in-stores when the Subscription Agreement was signed\n                    read with a sales report dated 2 April 2007 that referred also to one store\n                    and five stores-in-stores.[note: 11]This evidence was corroborated by the\n                    accounts in evidence,[note: 12]which only showed sales for one herbal store and\n                    five stores-in-stores. A profit and loss statement dated 7 May 2007 had\n                    entries for three new outlets,[note: 13]but the sales figures for each of those\n                    outlets was zero, and in the absence of any further evidence, it was\n                    questionable whether those outlets were in fact opened and operational. In any\n                    case, even if Marashi was right Euoro would still have fallen far short of the\n                    targets set in Annex A. It particularly failed to open any new stores,\n                    which would have been of a bigger scale and required more capital than\n                    stores-in-stores. Certainly, with Euoro’s cessation of business, Euoro and\n                    Marashi would no longer be able to meaningfully fulfil their continuing\n                    obligation under cl 7.2 to expand the business in accordance with the\n                    Marketing Plan in Annex A. That constituted a clear failure of\n                    reciprocity. 66     In addition, Euoro’s inability to expand\n                    the business in accordance with cl 7.2 certainly went to the root of the\n                    Subscription Agreement. I also rejected the plea in the Defence that\n                    Indulge’s non-payment had caused Euoro to suffer loss and\n                        damage,[note: 14]and more specifically the\n                    allegation in Marashi’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief that Euoro’s\n                    financial difficulties (and by implication its inability to perform cl 7.2)\n                    were partially caused by Indulge’s non-payment.[note: 15]In reality, it was obvious that Euoro could not,\n                    even with Indulge’s investment, fund its existing business, let alone at\n                    the same time expand the business as required under the Subscription Agreement.\n                    The evidence pointed to Euoro’s inability to continue to perform\n                    cl 7.2 and its other obligations under the Subscription Agreement was not\n                    attributable to Indulge’s non-payment of the third and fourth tranches,\n                    but were instead a result of Euoro’s inherent business and financial\n                    weaknesses. 67     Euoro’s audited accounts for the\n                    financial year 2006 showed that the company suffered a net loss for the year of\n                    $392,703 as compared to a smaller loss of $20,095 in 2005.[note: 16]From the financial year\n                    2006 Cash Flow Statement, net cash used in operating activities rose sharply to\n                    $180,429 from a mere $6,622 in the previous year.[note: 17]That was significant as it meant that\n                    Euoro’s existing operations were not cash generative enough to cover its\n                    own operating expenses but instead was consuming cash at an alarming rate. The\n                    financial year 2005 comparatives also showed a smaller cash consumption of\n                    $6,622 by Euoro’s operations.[note: 18]Even with the\n                    injection of $250,000 by Indulge in 2006, the company was in a serious cashflow\n                    problem – the financial year 2006 balance sheet[note: 19]showed that Euoro’s\n                    current assets of $192,616 were insufficient to meet current liabilities of\n                    $234,319, indicating that the company was technically insolvent. 68     The situation continued to worsen in the\n                    following first quarter of 2007 to 31 March 2007 as reflected in\n                    Euoro’s management accounts.[note: 20]Sales, which were already in a declining\n                    trend since 2006, fell sharply further to $298,493 as compared to a budgeted\n                    sales of $531,000 for the first quarter of 2007.[note: 21]That had the effect of exacerbating the\n                    already strained cashflow position as could be gleaned from the first quarter\n                    2007 Cash Flow Statement with cash used up in operating activities amounting to\n                        $174,924[note: 22]. If\n                    not for the injection of the second tranche of $250,000 in February 2007,\n                    Euoro’s state of affairs would have been worse. 69     A reasonable observation of the events during\n                    the above period from the financial year 2006 to 31 March 2007, was that\n                    Euoro’s operations were not generating sufficient sales to cover its\n                    expenses even as far back as 2005. This was exacerbated by its inability to\n                    collect previous debts, resulting in a bad debt write-off of $271,368 in\n                        2006.[note: 23]In the three-month\n                    period to 31 March 2007, the downward trend deteriorated further with\n                    actual sales significantly below its target sales in order for the operation to\n                    survive. In other words, Euoro’s operations were not able to sustain its\n                    own existence let alone expand in accordance with the Subscription Agreement.\n                    The trend evinced in the events from the financial year 2006 to 31 March\n                    2007 here is reinforced in Euoro’s April 2007 management accounts, where\n                    actual sales of $102,337 were down 58.4% compared to the month’s budgeted\n                    sales of $246,000, resulting in a loss of $62,464 when a profit of $23,000 was\n                        expected.[note: 24]Instead of generating cash, Euoro’s April 2007 operations consumed\n                    $27,682, and that further depleted its cash balance from $28,611 in the previous\n                    month to $929 at the end of April 2007.[note: 25]Here it will be recalled that there was\n                    no reliable evidence that new stores were in fact opened. There were pressing\n                    creditors to be paid, and the funds were used to meet current expenses and pay\n                    Euoro’s creditors. 70     Euoro’s finances were plainly such that,\n                    had the third and fourth tranches been paid and used to keep the business\n                    afloat, it still would not have the resources needed to fulfil the business\n                    plan. Marashi testified that Euoro did not close any of the outlets (meaning to\n                    trim expenses) as the company was obliged to expand under the business\n                        plan.[note: 26]That evidence would exacerbate the\n                    company’s financial position as explained above. I also did not think that\n                    Euoro could validly claim that it would have expended money from the third and\n                    fourth tranches on opening new stores and fulfilling its obligations under the\n                    Subscription Agreement. From Euoro’s past conduct in its utilisation of\n                    the funds from the first and second tranches, and bearing in mind the state of\n                    the business as explained earlier, Euoro would probably have used the moneys\n                    from the third and fourth tranches to repay the demands of creditors instead of\n                    opening new stores to maintain its existing operations. There was nothing in the\n                    evidence to suggest that it would change its approach in respect of the third\n                    and fourth tranches. 71     On a related point, I also rejected\n                    Ms Nithi’s submission that Indulge did not have a chance to lead\n                    evidence to challenge the allegation made in Mr Kumar’s further\n                    submissions that Indulge’s non-payment caused Euoro’s cessation of\n                    business. That allegation was clearly encompassed in the pleading in the Defence\n                    and the allegation made in Marashi’s evidence which I have referred to (at[66]above), and Indulge was fully able,\n                    if it had so wished, to challenge them in the course of the trial. In any case,\n                    since I have concluded that the allegation has not been proven, the issue is\n                    academic. 72     Indulge would not have a counterclaim that\n                    could adequately remedy Euoro’s breach. It would be unable to obtain\n                    specific performance of Euoro’s cl 7.2 obligation to expand the\n                    business for any number of reasons, including the impossibility of performance\n                    now that Euoro had ceased business. Indulge would also be unable to obtain\n                    substantive damages – the success of Euoro’s business was at best a\n                    matter of speculation.Yet, and this must be emphasised, it\n                        could not be denied that Indulge’s bargain with Euoro involved Euoro\n                        performing its obligations to take reasonable steps to implement the agreed\n                        business plan, and that Euoro would not be able to do so. Here I\n                    must reject Mr Kumar’s contention that Indulge’s obligation to\n                    pay the investment sum, including the third and fourth tranches, related only to\n                    the issuance and purchase of shares in Euoro, and that that exchange was\n                    severable from the rest of the Subscription Agreement. Indulge plainly did not\n                    agree to invest $1m just for the sake of being issued shares in Euoro. It did so\n                    in the overall context of an agreement with Euoro and Marashi to expand and\n                    develop the business of Euoro. It was entirely inconsistent with the\n                    parties’ commercial purposes to treat the investment sum as payment for\n                    Euoro’s shares alone, divorced from the parties’ agreement to expand\n                    the business using the investment money. 73     Given the circumstances – a failure of\n                    reciprocity by Euoro which cannot be adequately remedied by a counterclaim,\n                    which went to the root of the Subscription Agreement, and which was not caused\n                    by Indulge’s failure to pay the third and fourth tranches – I was of\n                    the opinion that an action for an agreed sum to recover the third and fourth\n                    tranches, if brought by Euoro, would not be sustainable. I would add, for the\n                    avoidance of doubt, that it was not Euoro’s cessation of businessper sewhich precluded its recovery of the\n                    third and fourth tranches. By the same token, Indulge was not relieved of\n                    payment simply because it entered into what seems like a bad bargain. Quite the\n                    contrary. Euoro was precluded from recovery, and Indulge was relieved from\n                    paying, because of Euoro’s inability to fulfil its continuing obligations\n                    under the Subscription Agreement. If, hypothetically, Euoro had fully executed\n                    all its obligations under the Subscription Agreement, the fact that it hadsubsequentlyceased business would not be a\n                    bar at all to its recovery of the third and fourth tranches. The requirement of\n                    reciprocity protected the sanctity of the exchange agreed to by the parties; it\n                    does not allow a party to escape from a bad bargain. 74     Since cl 7.2 applied equally to Marashi\n                    and he would similarly be unable to fulfil it, he would also be prevented, as I\n                    had earlier mentioned at[36]above, from\n                    directly enforcing Indulge’s obligation to pay the third and fourth\n                    tranches. Separately, Indulge would also be able to set up Euoro’s\n                    non-performance as a defence against Marashi’s counterclaim for payment to\n                    Euoro. 75     Consequently, if Euoro had brought a claim, it\n                    would be reduced to its remedy in damages. The quantum of damages would be\n                    assessed in order to put Euoro in the position it would be in had the\n                    Subscription Agreement been fully performed by all sides,iethe position Euoro would be in had Indulge paid the third and\n                    fourth tranches and Euoro performed its obligation to open new herbal stores and\n                    stores-in-stores as set out in Annex A to the Subscription Agreement. In my\n                    judgment, since the original chain of stores had failed without the third and\n                    fourth tranches, the infusion of the third and fourth tranches for the purpose\n                    of opening new stores would in all likelihood have also ended in failure. In\n                    other words, Euoro would be in the same position it was in at the time of the\n                    trial had the third and fourth tranches been paid. It would therefore only be\n                    entitled to nominal damages, had it been a party to the current\n                    proceedings.",
        "Conclusion": "76     For the reasons stated, both Indulge’s\n                    claim against Marashi and Marashi’s counterclaim against Indulge on behalf\n                    of Euoro were dismissed. Since both parties had failed in their respective\n                    claims, I made no order as to costs on the main action and the\n                    counterclaim.
