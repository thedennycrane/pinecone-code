        "Introduction": "1       The\nplaintiff, Wellspring Investments Ltd (“the Plaintiff”), is the owner\nof shop unit #B1-08 (“B1-08”) in a row of units in a development\nat No 17 Dairy Farm Road. The defendants, Samuel Sam and Chow Siow\nMay (“the Defendants”), are husband and wife. They are the owners\nof an adjoining shop unit #B1-09 (“B1-09”). The Plaintiff claimed\nthat the Defendants’ B1-09 was encroaching on its B1-08. The Plaintiff\nbrought this action to claim various reliefs, including a mandatory\ninjunction for the Defendants to pull down a wall separating the\ntwo units and to erect a new wall on an alleged proper boundary\nbetween the two units. 2       I\nheard submissions on 28 October 2013. Thereafter, I granted the Plaintiff\nthe reliefs it had sought with damages to be assessed by a judge\nand costs. I also granted a stay of one of my orders which required\nthe Defendants to pull down and reinstate the wall along the proper\nboundary pending an appeal to the Court of Appeal. At the Defendants’\nrequest, I heard further arguments. That hearing was on 20 January\n2014. Thereafter, I affirmed my earlier decision.",
        "The issues": "3       The\nDefendants’ arguments raised the following issues: (a)     whether\nB1-09 was in fact encroaching on B1-08; and (b)     whether\nthe terms of the Plaintiff’s purchase of B1-08 or of the Defendants’\npurchase of B1-09 were relevant.",
        "Whether B1-09 was in fact encroaching\non B1-08": "4       The\nPlaintiff’s case was straightforward. It had purchased B1-08 from a\nmortgagee bank (“Maybank”). According to an online search of the Singapore\nLand Authority (“SLA”) database, the area of B1-08 was stated to be\n41sqm. However, the actual physical area on site was smaller. 5       The\nPlaintiff engaged a surveyor, Mr Tang Tuck Kin (“Mr Tang”), in 2005\nto conduct a survey of B1-08 and the adjacent units. According to\nthe survey, B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08. The area of B1-09 was\nstated in a similar online search to be 41sqm,ie,\nthe same as that for B1-08. However, the actual physical area of\nB1-09 was about 61sqm whereas the actual physical area of B1-08\nwas about 21sqm. It appeared that B1-09 had encroached on B1-08\nby about 20sqm,ie, by about half\nof B1-08’s 41sqm. 6       The\nDefendants initially denied that B1-09 had encroached on B1-08. They\nsuggested that the encroachment was by unit #B1-07 (“B1-07”) instead.\nHowever, they did not engage a surveyor to pursue this allegation and\nindeed they stopped pursuing this point. 7       The\nDefendants’ second argument was that there was in fact no encroachment\nby B1-09. They alleged that the existing boundary wall between B1-09\nand B1-08 is in the correct place because that boundary wall is\ncorrectly placed between two sets of external windows. They implied\nthat the intention of the developer could not have been to place\na boundary wall in the midst of a set of external windows. If the\nboundary wall was moved as the Plaintiff wanted, it would split\nup one set of external windows which the developer could not have\nintended. Therefore, their position was that the survey plan for\nthe row of units in question had not been updated as should have\nbeen the case. The alleged error was in the failure or omission\nby the developer to amend the plan to be in line with the existing\nphysical situation on site. Therefore, the existing boundary wall\nbetween B1-09 and B1-08 is not in the wrong place. 8       There\nwas also a survey plan that was prepared by Mr Tang in 1993, which\nshowed that the areas of B1-08 and B1-09 were both 41sqm. The Defendants\nsuggested that this survey plan was there only to apportion the share\nvalues for each strata title. This argument did not make any sense. There\nwas no reason for the survey plan to give wrong information just\nto apportion the share values for each strata title. 9       As\nfor the second argument that the 1993 survey plan was incorrect, the\nDefendants faced various hurdles. 10     First,\nthere was no evidence from the developer to support the Defendants’\nsuggestion. 11     Secondly,\nthe existing boundary wall between two other units,ie,\nB1-07 and B1-08 was already placed in the midst of a set of external\nwindows. If the developer was using the set of external windows\nas the guide for which each boundary wall was to be placed, then\nthe boundary wall between B1-07 and B1-08 was placed at the wrong\nlocation. Yet there was no suggestion by anyone, including the Defendants,\nthat this was the case. 12     Thirdly,\nMr Tang was the surveyor who had prepared the 1993 plan of the development.\nHe was also the surveyor engaged by the Plaintiff in 2005, after\nthe Plaintiff had purchased B1-08. Mr Tang did not say that there\nwas an error in the 1993 plan or that there was an omission to update the\nplan. On the contrary, his survey in 2005 indicated that B1-09 had encroached\non B1-08, as stated above. 13     Fourthly,\nthe area of each unit was stated in the database of the SLA. The\nsuggestion that the areas for B1-08 and B1-09 were wrongly stated\nwas quite astounding, as there was no real evidence to support the\nDefendants’ suggestion. The location of the external windows was\nunreliable and inadequate evidence to support the Defendants’ suggestion,\nin the absence of any evidence from the developer to that effect. 14     In\npassing, I mention one other point. It was unclear who was responsible\nfor the position of the existing boundary wall between B1-08 and\nB1-09. Was it placed there by the developer, or one of the previous owners\nbefore Maybank sold B1-09 to the Defendants? The Defendants had initially\nspeculated that the existing wall was put up by the mortgagor but switched\ntheir position later and suggested that the existing wall was put\nup by the developer. In any event, it was immaterial who was responsible\nfor the position of the existing boundary wall. 15     The\nDefendants’ third argument was that the boundary wall was already\nin existence when they bought B1-09. However, that was immaterial to\nthe Plaintiff’s claim for encroachment. 16     The\nDefendants’ fourth argument was that the search on SLA’s database\nfor B1-08 revealed that there was no encumbrance. Therefore, the Plaintiff\ncould not claim that B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08. I was of the view\nthat the Defendants had got the argument backwards. It is for the person\nclaiming a valid interest to lodge or register the appropriate instrument\non the land register. The absence of notification of any encumbrance\non the land register is to the benefit of the Plaintiff and not the\nDefendants. If the Defendants were right, then an owner may encroach on\nthe property of his neighbour, and when his misdeed is discovered,\nhe is entitled to say that because no encumbrance is recorded in\nthe particulars of the neighbour’s property in the relevant land\nregister, his neighbour cannot complain about his encroachment.\nThat is not correct. The same point applies even if the encroachment\nwas committed by a previous owner and not the current owner.",
        "Whether the terms of the Plaintiff’s\npurchase of B1-08 or of the Defendants’ purchase of B1-09 were relevant": "17     I\ncome now to the second issue. In relation to this issue, the Defendants\nhad two arguments. The Defendants’ first argument was that they\ntoo had bought their unit from Maybank. They inferred that Maybank’s\nterms of sale of B1-08 to the Plaintiff would be the same as Maybank’s\nterms of sale of B1-09 to them (the Defendants), even though the\nsale of B1-09 to the Defendants was in 2001 and the sale of B1-08\nto the Plaintiff was in late 2004 or early 2005. 18     The\nDefendants argued that it was likely that the Plaintiff would have bought\nB1-08 on an “as is where is” basis just as they did when they bought B1-09.\nThey also referred to several terms of their purchase which would preclude\na purchaser from raising with Maybank any objection to the area of\nthe unit purchased from Maybank. However, the obstacle facing the Defendants\nwas that there was no privity of contract between the Plaintiff and\nthe Defendants. Even if the terms of sale of B1-08 precluded the Plaintiff\nfrom complaining to Maybank about the area of B1-08, the Defendants\nwere not entitled to the benefit of those terms. To overcome this\nhurdle, the Defendants relied on s 46(2)(b)\nof the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 2004 Rev Ed) (“the LTA”) which\nstates: (2)    Nothing\nin this section shall be held to prejudice the rights and remedies\nof any person— … (b)    to enforce against a proprietor\nany contract to which that proprietor was a party; … 19     I\nwas of the view that the Defendants had misinterpreted s 46(2)(b) of the LTA. It merely preserves the\nright of a person to enforce against a proprietor a contract to\nwhich that proprietor was a party. It does not create a new right\nif none existed. The person seeking to enforce the contract must first\nestablish his right to do so. The Defendants were not able to establish that\nright since they were not a party to the contract of sale between Maybank\nand the Plaintiff. 20     The\nDefendants’ second argument was that the Plaintiff was getting a windfall.\nThey suggested that the Plaintiff must have inspected B1-08 and have\nknown that the area of that unit was less than 41sqm. This was “supported”\nby the fact that the Plaintiff had paid only $90,000 for B1-08. On\nthe other hand, the Defendants had paid $240,000 for B1-09. By referring\nto the price they had paid, the Defendants were suggesting that they\nhad paid a much higher price than the Plaintiff because they were supposed\nto get a much larger unit than the Plaintiff; whereas, if the Plaintiff\nwere entitled to the reliefs sought, the area of the two units would be\nabout the same. The Defendants attempted to show that the Plaintiff\nhad paid an unusually low price for a 41sqm unit and that they (the\nDefendants) had paid an unusually high price for a 41sqm unit by\nreferring to prices reflected in online property searches done for\nthe periods 2002 to 2003 and 2004 to 2005 respectively. 21     As\nregards such evidence, the Plaintiff pointed out that, firstly,\nthe online property searches were general and were not even confined\nto the Dairy Farm area. They covered District 23 which included\nHillview, Bukit Panjang and Choa Chu Kang. Secondly, the Defendants\nhad bought B1-09 in or about April 2001. Yet they were using figures\nfor the period 2002 to 2003. This suggested that the 2001 figures\nwould not support their contention that they had paid an unusually\nhigh price for a 41sqm unit. I agreed with these two submissions\nmade by the Plaintiff. 22     The\nDefendants did not adduce any other evidence to support their allegation\nthat the price they had paid was for a 61sqm unit. At the first hearing\nof the Plaintiff’s application on 30 July 2013, the Defendants’ counsel,\nMr Godwin Campos (“Mr Campos”), had already raised the allegation\nthat the price that the Defendants had paid was much more than what\nthe price for a 41sqm unit would have been. When I asked him whether\nhe had verified this allegation with the solicitors who had acted\nfor the Defendants in their purchase of B1-09, he said he had not.\nI granted an adjournment to give the Defendants time to file an\naffidavit in response to the first affidavit filed for the Plaintiff. 23     The\naffidavit in response was the first affidavit of the first Defendant filed\non 7 August 2013. There was no letter or supporting affidavit from\nthe solicitors acting for the Defendants in their purchase of B1-09.\nThere was therefore no evidence from the solicitors acting for them\nin their purchase to support their contention that they had paid\nfor a unit larger than 41sqm. This omission, coupled with their\ntactic of referring to prices for the period 2002 to 2003 of properties\nin District 23, instead of 2001 prices for properties in Dairy Farm\nestate only, led me to conclude that their allegation that they\nhad paid for a larger unit was untrue and that it was they who were\nseeking to reap an undeserved windfall. 24     More\nimportantly, it seemed to me that the issue was not whether the Plaintiff\nwould be obtaining a windfall or whether the Defendants would have\nsuffered a loss if the court were to grant the reliefs which the\nPlaintiff sought. The real question was whether the Defendants had\nacquired title to a unit of about 61sqm when they paid $240,000.\nIf the Plaintiff was obtaining a windfall at the expense of Maybank,\nthat was not the Defendants’ concern. Even if the Defendants had\ncontracted with Maybank to purchase B1-09 on the basis that B1-09\nhas a floor area of 61sqm, that would not assist the Defendants\nvis-à-vis the Plaintiff if B1-09 in fact has a floor area of 41sqm.\nThe Defendants’ recourse would be possibly against Maybank only.\nHowever, if they were precluded by the terms of their purchase from\nmaking any claim against Maybank, then they would have to bear the\nloss. Therefore, the terms of the Plaintiff’s purchase of B1-08\nand the Defendants’ purchase of B1-09 were irrelevant. 25     In\nthe circumstances, I did not accept the Defendants’ argument that the\naction should have been commenced by way of a writ of summons, as opposed\nto an originating summons. The Defendants were suggesting that there\nwere major disputes of relevant facts because the terms on which\nthe Plaintiff had purchased B1-08 from Maybank were relevant. However,\nas stated above, the Defendants were not a party to that contract. Furthermore,\nthe Plaintiff did establish that B1-09 was encroaching on B1-08. 26     Accordingly,\nI granted the Plaintiff the reliefs it had sought with damages to\nbe assessed by a judge and costs. I also ordered a stay as mentioned\nabove.",
        "Further arguments": "27     Subsequent\nto my decision on 28 October 2013, the Defendants’ solicitors, Godwin\nCampos LLC (“Campos”) wrote on 4 November 2013 to request an opportunity\nto present further arguments. Various reasons were given but the\nmost pertinent one was in para 4 of Campos’ letter. It stated that\nthe Defendants had found old letters (in the plural) written to\nthem by Maybank’s solicitors before Maybank sold B1-08 to the Plaintiff.\nThe allegation was that Maybank always knew that B1-08 was only\n21sqm. Maybank had asked the Defendants to buy the said 21sqm. The\nDefendants had declined and Maybank subsequently sold B1-08 to the\nPlaintiff. The letters were said to be “pivotal to any adjudication\nof the present matter”. 28     Paragraph\n6 of Campos’ letter stated that the Defendants do not have their\nsale and purchase agreement as the Defendants’ previous solicitors, M/s\nBoswell, Hsieh & Lim (“BH&L”), had ceased practice some\nyears ago. A letter confirming this could be produced if so required. 29     Paragraph\n11 of Campos’ letter stated that Maybank and Jones Lang Lasalle\n(who conducted the auction of B1-08 to the Plaintiff) ought to be made\nparties to the Plaintiff’s action “to bring the fullest facts …\nfor fair and final determination”. 30     Campos’\nletter did not enclose the alleged letters from Maybank’s solicitors\nas should have been done. Nevertheless, I decided to accede to the request\nfor further arguments to be presented. Subsequently, I directed\nthe Registrar of the Supreme Court to write to notify the solicitors\nof both sides that the old letters which had been referred to in\npara 4 of Campos’ letter had not been enclosed with that letter\nand also to inform them that the time for filing an appeal pending\nthe outcome of the further arguments was suspended. 31     On\n6 December 2013, Campos wrote to forward one letter dated 23 September\n2002 from Rajah & Tann LLP (“R&T”) (Maybank’s solicitors) to\nthe Defendants (“the R&T Letter”) and one letter dated 12 November 2003\nfrom BH&L to the Defendants. The contents of each letter were revealing\nas I will elaborate on later. 32     The\nfurther arguments took place on 20 January 2014. Mr Campos, counsel\nfor the Defendants, did not even seek to elaborate on why the Defendants\ncould not find the two letters from R&T and from BH&L earlier. 33     In\nany event, the letter from BH&L did not help the Defendants’\ncase. It showed that BH&L had informed the Defendants in November\n2003 that BH&L would cease practice from 1 January 2004. That\nletter also asked the Defendants to “collect the complete file”\nrelating to B1-09 for their own safe-keeping. This letter came as\na surprise to me. As mentioned above, I had given time to the Defendants\nto try and get whatever information they might need from the solicitors\nwho had acted for them in the purchase of B1-09. Mr Campos did not\ndisclose then that their previous solicitors had ceased practice\nand that the Defendants already had an opportunity to collect the\ncomplete file from the previous solicitors. Perhaps Mr Campos did\nnot know about BH&L’s letter dated 12 November 2003. Eventually, Mr Campos\nconfirmed that the Defendants did in fact collect the complete file\nfrom BH&L. 34     As\nfor the R&T Letter, it referred to a letter dated 25 June 2002\n(from R&T to the Defendants) and an email dated 28 June 2002\n(from the Defendants to R&T). Mr Campos said that the Defendants\ncould not locate the earlier letter dated 25 June 2002 or their\nemail. No elaboration was given. Mr Campos did not ask R&T for\na copy of either. His only excuse was that the communication was\nso long ago. In any event, the R&T Letter was revealing. 35     It\nshowed that the Defendants had realised in 2002, if not earlier,\nthat B1-09 only had a floor area of 41 sqm, and that the Defendants\nhad already made an issue of this with Maybank. The R&T Letter\ndid not agree with the Defendants that they were entitled to an\nadditional 20sqm. This suggested that the Defendants were not truthful\nwhen they contended that they had in fact contracted to buy a unit\nof 61sqm. They might have thought that the unit was of that size\nbut that was different from saying that their contract specified\nthat size. Indeed, they were unable to produce any document to support\nthe latter. 36     Furthermore,\nthe R&T Letter did not say that B1-08 was only 21sqm as was\nalleged in Campos’ letter dated 4 November 2013. On the contrary, the\nR&T Letter had proposed that the Defendants purchase the additional area\noccupied by them (about 20sqm) and the “remaining” area of B1-08 (about\n21sqm) at a price to be agreed. R&T also threatened to take\nsteps to recover “the encroached area” from the Defendants if there\nwas no agreement on the proposal. Paragraph 4 of Campos’ letter\nwas therefore misleading. 37     Ironically,\nthe substance of the R&T Letter made the Defendants’ case worse.\nIt showed that: (a)     The\nDefendants knew that their allegation in the present action that\nany encroachment was by B1-07 (and not B1-09) or that there was\nno encroachment of B1-08 was false. They already knew in 2002 that\nB1-09 was encroaching upon B1-08. (b)     If\nthe Defendants genuinely believed that an error had been made in\nthe 1993 survey plan, they would have made an application for rectification\nin 2002 or 2003 after R&T’s letter. They did not do so and only\nmentioned rectification in 2013 and 2014 in the proceedings before\nme. (c)     Maybank\nwas disputing with the Defendants that they were entitled to 61sqm,\ncontrary to the Defendants’ suggestion. This reinforced the point\nthat the Defendants’ emphasis on their purchase price was irrelevant. (d)     The\nDefendants were given the opportunity to buy B1-08 comprising the\nencroached area of 20sqm and the remaining area of 21sqm. They chose\nnot to do so. (e)     Maybank\nknew that B1-08 was 41sqm and knew about the problem of the encroachment.\nThere was no basis to suggest that Maybank had sold or transferred\nonly 21sqm to the Plaintiff when Maybank sold B1-08. 38     Unsurprisingly,\nPlaintiff’s counsel did not pursue his objection to the Defendants’\nintroduction of the two letters from BH&L and from R&T. 39     As\nfor the Defendants’ repeated arguments that more information should\nbe given about the terms of the contract between the Plaintiff and Maybank,\nI have said above that such terms were irrelevant. The Defendants\nare not a party to that contract and they acquired title to their own\nunit of about 41sqm only. 40     I\nwas of the view that the Defendants had been economical with the truth.\nThey have had the benefit of wrongfully occupying the additional 21sqm\nfor about 12 years with full knowledge of the encroachment. I affirmed\nmy orders given on 28 October 2013 including the stay order pending\nan appeal."
