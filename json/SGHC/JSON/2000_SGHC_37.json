        "Background facts": "3 The plaintiffs were manufacturers and suppliers of strip ceiling\n\nsystems. They were incorporated in Singapore in 1992 as a subsidiary of the well-known\n\nSwiss corporation Gema Metaldecken AG, one of the world's leading metal ceiling\n\nmanufacturers.4 The defendants, a company incorporated in Malaysia, were the\n\nnominated sub-contractors engaged by Perspect-Tasisei Kajima Shimizu Hazama Consortium\n\n(\"the main contractor\") for the construction of Hyperbolic-Parabolic and Curved\n\nMetal Linear Strip Ceilings on the underside of the roof to the main terminal building,\n\ncontact pier and baggage handling system of the Kuala Lumpur International Airport at\n\nSepang in Malaysia (\"the KLIA Project\").5 By the terms of the contract between the defendants and the main\n\ncontractor, the defendants were responsible for the design and installation of the metal\n\nceiling system in both the internal and external areas of the KLIA. The present dispute\n\nrelates only to the external metal ceiling system at the KLIA.6 Annexed to the sub-contract documents between the defendants and the\n\nmain contractor was a list of specifications issued by the airport authorities as part of\n\nthe main contract documents. In the section titled 'H31 Architectural Specifications -\n\nMetal Sheet Covering: Roof and Combined Ceiling', it was specifically stated at Clause 42\n\nthat the installation shall withstand a wind loading relative to a maximum wind velocity\n\nof 35.5 m/s. At the same time, the sub-contract document itself also specified that\n\nChapter V: Part 2 of the British Standard Code of Practice for the structural use of\n\naluminium was to be the applicable design code for wind loads in relation to the KLIA\n\nProject.7 Between late 1995 and early 1996, negotiations ensued between the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendants concerning how they could work together in respect of the\n\nKLIA Project. Throughout this time, many meetings were held by the parties either at the\n\nplaintiffs' or the defendants' office. Any negotiation or correspondence between the\n\nparties would be conducted mainly through Mr Werner Bolt (PW1) on behalf of the\n\nplaintiffs, and Mr Masahito Nanko (DW1) on behalf of the defendants.8 On 13 November 1995, PW1 and DW1 met at the defendants' office in\n\nKuala Lumpur. At this meeting, the following matters were agreed upon:(i) The plaintiffs would appoint someone from their side as a Design\n\n  Manager to provide Computer Assisted Drawings (CAD) and attend site meetings in Kuala\n\n  Lumpur;(ii) The Design Manager appointed by the plaintiffs would be\n\n  responsible for preparing most of the drawings required by the main-contractor in respect\n\n  of the KLIA Project;(iii) The plaintiffs would issue their official quotation for the strip\n\n  ceiling system to the defendants as soon as possible; and(iv) The submitted price in the quotation would be inclusive of the\n\n  cost of supplying the Design Manager and the work to be undertaken by him..9 On 23 November 1995, the plaintiffs submitted a quotation in writing\n\nto the defendants for the supply of strip ceilings. It stated,inter alia, that:The price reduction for supply\n\n  only without any technical and drawing service would be 20%.10 On 13 January 1996, the defendants issued a letter of intent\n\n(\"the letter of intent\") to the plaintiffs confirming their intention to enter\n\ninto a contract with the latter for the design and supply of metal ceiling materials for\n\nthe KLIA Project. This letter was expressed to be subject to satisfactory negotiation of\n\nterms and conditions.11 Various other correspondence and meetings between the parties\n\nfollowed, although no formal contract was ever entered into between them. A practice soon\n\ndeveloped whereby purchase orders for various components of the metal ceiling system would\n\nbe issued by the defendants to the plaintiffs and the said components would subsequently\n\nbe delivered by the plaintiffs to the defendants. The plaintiffs also issued invoices for\n\npayment in respect of the deliveries made. Aside from the invoices for goods supplied,\n\nseparate invoices were also issued by the plaintiffs containing the words 'Being costs for\n\ndesign, engineering and draughtsman work' in the column titled 'Description'. The date of\n\nthe first purchase order issued by the plaintiffs was 11 June 1996.12 At this juncture, it is perhaps pertinent to set out in some detail\n\nthe structure of the external metal ceiling system at the KLIA.Structure of the external metal ceiling system at the KLIA13 The entire external metal ceiling system used in the KLIA can be\n\ndescribed as a sort of suspended ceiling system. It can roughly be divided into two\n\nseparate sections. The first, or upper section consists of layers of stainless steel\n\nsheets, cement boards and rock wool which are firmly attached to the steel roof structure\n\nof the ceiling by way of steel purlins (Exhibit D5). Attached to the purlins by way\n\nof special clips are the vertical ceiling hangers which hang perpendicularly to the roof\n\nstructure. At the lower end of each hanger is a feature called the Primary Angle, an\n\nelongated L-shaped steel bar which is attached to the hanger via nuts and bolts. This\n\nentire upper section of the ceiling may be referred to as the suspension system or simply,\n\nthe upper section.14 Below the suspension system is the lower section of the ceiling\n\nwhich consists of supporting carrier rails (Exhibit D2) that are screwed on to the\n\nPrimary Angles in such a way that they run horizontally, or parallel to the steel roof\n\nstructure. Attached at cross-angles to the underside of the carrier rails are the metal\n\nstrip ceilings (Exhibit D1). Each strip is made of a thin, flat piece of aluminium\n\nmeasuring about 100mm in width and up to 3.2m in length. One side of the strip consists of\n\na timber finish. In order to install the strips onto the ceiling system, the ends of each\n\nstrip along its length are bent inwards, so that the curved edges can be secured to the\n\ncarrier rails by way of clip-ins, or flaps in the carrier rails which are punched-out and\n\nfolded down to allow the curved edge of the ceiling strips to be clipped around them. The\n\nceiling strips are placed closely together with its timber surface facing downwards. Each\n\nstrip is separated by what is known as a capping profile (Exhibit D3), a long, thin\n\nand flat strip of metal which, together with the clip-ins, aid in securing the strips to\n\nthe carrier rails. The distance between each carrier rail is not fixed and can be varied\n\ndepending on the design of the system. Before or at the time of the incidents (described\n\nbelow), the carrier rails used at the KLIA were supported at a distance or spacing of\n\n1.2m.15 For the purposes of the KLIA Project, only D1, D2 and D3 were\n\nsupplied by the plaintiffs to the defendants. The other parts of the metal ceiling system,\n\nparticularly, those comprising the upper section, were sourced by the defendants from\n\nlocal suppliers in Malaysia and elsewhere. The total surface area of strip ceilings\n\nsupplied by the plaintiffs to the defendants for the KLIA Project was in the region of\n\nabout 120,000 square metres, while the total value of the plaintiffs' charges for the\n\nexternal ceiling system amounted to about RM5m.The incidents16 On 27 June 1997, a few of the metal ceiling strips (i.e., D1)\n\ndislodged from the carrier rails and fell. This was followed by one or two similar\n\nincidents over the next six months. It is significant that on each occasion in which the\n\nstrips dislodged, the carrier rails and everything else above them, i.e., the upper or\n\nsuspended section of the ceiling system, remained intact and did not fall.17 Subsequently, a series of wind-pressure and wind-tunnel tests were\n\ncarried out on a mock-up of the KLIA ceiling system in Hong Kong by a firm of engineering\n\nconsultants called J A Shillinglaw & Associates. It appears that the first test on 11\n\nDecember 1997 was commissioned by the plaintiffs, while subsequent tests carried out on\n\n12, 13, 30 and 31 December 1997 (\"the later tests\") were commissioned by the\n\ndefendants only. There was some measure of disagreement at the trial whether or not the\n\nplaintiffs were aware or approved of the later tests carried out by the defendants. In the\n\nsame vein, much argument was also raised before the trial regarding the admissibility of\n\nthe later tests' results and/or the opinion given thereon on the ground of hearsay. I\n\nshall address these arguments later on in my judgment.18 Following the above tests, the defendants requested the plaintiffs\n\nto design and produce a security clip which would prevent the strip ceilings from falling.\n\nThe plaintiffs subsequently manufactured and supplied these security clips (Exhibit D10)\n\nto the defendants, although it appeared that no agreement was ever reached regarding\n\npayment for the clips.19 Apart from installing the security clips which served to fortify and\n\nstrengthen the grip or connection between the curved edges of the strip ceilings and the\n\ncapping profiles, the defendants also undertook various other rectification works in\n\nrespect of the external ceiling system.20 The KLIA became fully operational and was officially opened at the\n\nend of June 1998.The Plaintiffs' Case21 The plaintiffs' claim was in the main for two separate sums of\n\nS$143,250 and RM232,943.45 respectively. It is proposed to deal with these two amounts\n\nseparately.Claim for S$143,25022 This amount was for the security clips supplied by the plaintiffs to\n\nthe defendants after the collapse of the strip ceilings at the KLIA. Upon receiving the\n\ndefendants' request for the supply of the security clips, the plaintiffs requested for the\n\nissuance of formal purchase orders. The defendants refused, stating that they had\n\nunderstood the supply of the clips to be free of charge. This suggestion was rejected by\n\nthe plaintiffs who alleged that the defendants had, at the time when they requested for\n\nthe supply of the clips, already defaulted in payments approximating the sum of RM500,000.\n\nAs a result, the plaintiffs counterproposed in writing to the defendants, requesting the\n\nlatter to first make payment of the arrears amounting to RM500,000 in which event the\n\nusual credit terms would be granted to the defendants in respect of the security clips.\n\nAlternatively, the clips would be supplied on a strictly cash-on-delivery basis. The\n\ndefendants replied that they would pay the RM500,000.23 In consequence, the plaintiffs contended that there was an\n\nacceptance by the defendants of the former's terms of supply for the security clips, i.e.,\n\nthat the clips would be paid for, albeit on the usual credit basis. The plaintiffs also\n\ndrew the court's attention to the following words contained in their standard form\n\ninvoice:Please check that our\n\n  interpretation of your order is correct and in accordance with your requirements and\n\n  inform us immediately in case of any discrepancies. Gema is not responsible for items\n\n  manufactured incorrectly but in accordance with our acknowledgement.In view of the fact that the defendants made no objection in writing\n\nupon receipt of the disputed invoice for the security clips, the plaintiffs submitted that\n\nthey had proven their claim for S$143,250 on a balance of probability.Claim for RM232,943.4524 This claim comprised of various allegedly unpaid invoices.Invoice No. 602526This was for a sum of RM225.20 for which the plaintiffs agreed at the\n\ntrial to give a credit note to the defendants.Invoice No. 97568This was for a sum of RM21,251 in respect of certain airfreight charges\n\nwhich the plaintiffs alleged they did not agree to bear. Again, the plaintiffs submitted\n\nthat no objection in writing was made by the defendants upon receipt of this invoice and\n\nas such the defendants should be liable for the invoiced sum.Invoice No. 97693This was for a sum of RM2,830.46 for the supply of certain tiles to the\n\ndefendants. No other evidence was led by the plaintiffs in respect of this claim save that\n\nthey again pointed out that no objection in writing was made by the defendants upon\n\nreceipt of this invoice as a result of which the defendants were liable for the sum\n\nclaimed.The remaining invoicesThe balance of the plaintiffs' claim under this head totalled\n\nRM208,636.79. This amount was in respect of various invoices issued for components D1, D2\n\nand D3 which were supplied to the defendants before the first collapse of the ceiling\n\nstrips at the KLIA (\"the original supply\").The Defence and Counterclaim25 Save for the plaintiffs' claim for the original supply of D1, D2 and\n\nD3, the rest of the plaintiffs' claim was denied by the defendants. The defendants alleged\n\nfirstly that there was a contract between the parties in which it was the plaintiffs'\n\nresponsibility both to design, as well as to supply the materials for, the metal ceiling\n\nsystem. It was submitted that the plaintiffs had breached the contract for design in that\n\nthey had failed to design a ceiling system which complied with the specifications for the\n\nKLIA Project as set out in the nominated sub-contract documents. Secondly, the defendants\n\nalso alleged that the plaintiffs were late in delivering certain capping profiles (D3),\n\nleading to them having to incur additional transport, customs and other miscellaneous\n\nexpenses. Thirdly, the defendants alleged that the plaintiffs failed to deliver various\n\nshipping and other documents in time for clearance from customs, resulting in additional\n\nport and storage charges having to be incurred. Various other claims were also put forward\n\nby the defendants at the start, although most of them were readily abandoned by counsel at\n\nthe close of the trial. It is thus not proposed to go into these other heads of claims. I\n\nshall proceed to deal only with the three heads as set out above.Claim for breach of contract in the design of the metal ceiling system26 The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs had contracted with\n\nthem not only to manufacture and supply the requisite quantities of D1, D2 and D3, but\n\nalso to design the external ceiling system intended for use at the KLIA. It was the\n\ndefendants' contention that the scope of the plaintiffs' responsibility to design the\n\nmetal ceiling system covered not only the technical design of D1, D2 and D3, but also\n\nincluded the determination of the appropriate spacing between D2 (i.e, the supporting\n\ncarrier rails). In any event, it was incumbent on the plaintiffs to ensure that the design\n\nof the metal ceiling system as a whole was suitable and fit for its purpose and that the\n\nsystem as a whole together with its individual components were of merchantable or\n\nsatisfactory quality.27 The defendants sought to prove that the scope of the contract\n\nincluded design (as opposed to just supply) by reference to the following. First, the\n\ncourt's attention was drawn to the various invoices issued by the plaintiffs which were\n\nstated to be in respect of costs for 'design, engineering and draughtsman work'. DW1, a\n\ndirector of the defendant company, in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief pointed out the\n\nfact that the apportionment of costs for materials supplied and services rendered in the\n\nproportion of 70:30 meant that the plaintiffs had charged a whopping RM1.5m for design and\n\nengineering services altogether. As such, they could not now deny that the scope of the\n\ncontract did not include design of the metal ceiling system. DW1 also denied PW1's\n\nsuggestion that the apportionment was a sham entered into to allow the defendants to evade\n\nMalaysian import tax. He stated that the initial request to split the costs into cost for\n\nsupply and cost for services originated from the plaintiffs themselves. This was clearly\n\nborne out in the plaintiffs' fax of 23 November 1995 stipulating that any reduction in\n\nprice for \"technical and drawing service\" would be 20% (see  9 above). It was\n\nonly subsequently that the defendants requested for the split to be in the proportion of\n\n70:30. DW1 explained that the reason for this was because fees for services were paid in\n\ncash while that for materials were paid by way of letter of credit (\"L/C\"). As\n\nsuch, by increasing the non-L/C or cash component of payment from 20% to 30%, the\n\ndefendants would obtain a larger safety margin to hold back payment in the event of\n\nproblems with their suppliers. While DW1 admitted that he was aware from experience that\n\ntax on services was normally less than tax on materials, the fact that his company's\n\nproposal of allocating costs in the proportion of 70:30 might inadvertently lead to a\n\nsavings in tax did not occur to him at that time. DW1 testified that his only concern was\n\nthat the total price charged by the plaintiffs fell within his overall budget for the KLIA\n\nProject and it did not really matter to him how the costs for materials and services were\n\nfinally apportioned.28 Next, it was also stressed that the plaintiffs had constantly\n\nprovided shop drawings to the defendants which drawings the defendants relied on to\n\ninstall the metal ceiling system. It was the defendants' case that these drawings could\n\nonly have been produced by the party responsible for designing the system. One Kenneth\n\nJames Patterson - Kane (DW2), a civil engineer by training and profession, gave expert\n\nevidence on behalf of the defendants. DW2 opined that the shop drawings produced by the\n\nplaintiffs were in essence engineering or technical designs or plans, given the fact that\n\nthe structural elements of the ceiling together with their respective sizes and spacings\n\nwere all defined. He confirmed that it was industry practice to refer to such drawings as\n\n\"shop drawings\". DW2 also explained that the expression \"for approval\"\n\ncontained in many of the shop drawings supplied by the plaintiffs meant only that the\n\ndrawings were for the approval of the owners' consultants, in this case, the airport\n\nauthority's consultants. He added however that any approval given by the owners'\n\nconsultants was normally subject to such conditions or restrictions as would exclude\n\nresponsibility for design and dimensions. In DW2's view, such drawings would also\n\neventually be used to install the ceiling as detailed in the drawings. DW2 further\n\nconfirmed that any shop drawings submitted for approval would normally be based on the\n\napplicable structural design in accordance with applicable design loads. Such technical\n\ninformation and data, it was said, was proprietary and could only have been within the\n\nplaintiffs' exclusive possession. In support of this contention, the defendants relied on\n\nthe following which was printed at the top right-hand corner of the shop drawings supplied\n\nby the plaintiffs:GEMA METAL CEILINGS GROUP CLAIMS\n\n  PROPRIETARY RIGHTS IN THE INFORMATION DISCLOSED HEREIN.In the defendants' view, the fact that the plaintiffs found it\n\nnecessary to reserve their claims of proprietary rights in the information disclosed was\n\nclear evidence that the plaintiffs regarded the information as their property which was\n\nnot to be used by others without their prior consent. Reference was further made to a\n\nspecific shop drawing in which the carrier rail (D2) was expressly described as a\n\n'continuous galvanised steelproprietarycarrier profile'. That all necessary data\n\nwas within the exclusive purview of the plaintiffs pointed to the fact that responsibility\n\nfor design could only have been theirs.29 Emphasis was also placed on the fact that the plaintiffs had\n\ncontinually refused to divulge important technical information and data on D1, D2 and D3\n\nto the defendants, despite repeated requests by the latter. It was confirmed by DW2 that\n\nD1, D2 and D3 were all proprietary components. As such, it was not possible for the\n\ndefendants to have designed the ceiling system when crucial technical information on the\n\nceiling components was not forthcoming. Counsel for the defendants referred to a fax dated\n\n10 May 1996 from the defendants to the plaintiffs wherein DW1 had requested for technical\n\ninformation on the \"tensile load\" for certain components of the ceiling system.\n\nMore specifically, there was a request for information on 'how tight the strip ceiling\n\nwill clip/hold when wind pressure is given'. In reply, the plaintiffs wrote:Such a test for pull down is not\n\n  existing and as far as I know nobody has such a test ever done, I am sorry, I can't help\n\n  you in this matter.Nothing whatsoever was said about the \"tensile load\"\n\ninformation requested for by the defendants, nor was it specifically stated that the\n\nceiling system could not withstand prevailing wind pressures. Dissatisfied with the\n\nresponse, DW1 wrote again to the plaintiffs on 13 May 1996, stating:Please let us know your comment as manufacture for such\n\n  a doubt. Do you have any recommendation of material for inside and outside after\n\n  considering such a doubt?Nothing further was received from the plaintiffs with regard to this\n\nmatter. Under cross-examination, DW1 testified that he did at some point orally ask PW1 if\n\nthe ceiling system could withstand the \"situation of the Project\", to which PW1\n\nhad replied, \"No worry, no problem\". As a result, DW1 trusted that the\n\nplaintiffs would design the metal ceiling system properly. He further explained in\n\ncross-examination that the defendants did not go to some other expert or engineer to\n\nobtain the information which the plaintiffs refused to provide because to do so would have\n\nbeen an exercise in futility. The reason for this was because the information was\n\nproprietary, and as such, the only party privy to it were the plaintiffs. Hence, the\n\ndefendants had no choice but to trust the plaintiffs and to proceed with the installation\n\nbased on the shop drawings provided by the latter. No further insistence on a disclosure\n\nof the information was made as it was assumed that the plaintiffs were legitimately\n\nseeking to protect their proprietary rights. DW2, the expert, also gave evidence that\n\nwithout the relevant technical data of the ceiling components, it would not have been\n\npossible for the defendants or anyone for that matter to calculate with accuracy the\n\nmaximum wind speed which the ceiling system would be able to withstand. Such calculations\n\ncould only be done if information contained in the manufacturer's data sheets or the load\n\ntest results were disclosed.30 DW1 also gave evidence that before liasing with the plaintiffs, the\n\ndefendants had in fact previously negotiated with a leading firm of metal ceiling\n\nspecialists, M/s Chicago Metallic for the design of the metal ceiling system. These\n\nearlier negotiations had failed precisely because Chicago Metallic could not provide\n\ndesign services for the ceiling system, which services the defendants required. While it\n\nwas admitted that the defendants were no doubt in the construction industry, it was\n\nexplained that the metal ceiling system intended for use in the KLIA was a complex\n\nthree-dimensional system with which the defendants had had no prior experience nor\n\nexpertise. As such, they specifically required a separate firm of professionals to design\n\nthe system for them.31 DW1 further testified that during the period between 8 September\n\n1995 to 19 February 1998, both the defendants' and the plaintiffs' representatives,\n\nincluding DW1 and PW1, held over 37 meetings to discuss the various aspects of the works\n\nto be carried out by the respective parties. Throughout these meetings, PW1 had frequently\n\nemphasised that part of the Gema Group's strategy was the provision of design and\n\nengineering services. DW1 also stressed that the defendants were very careful to select a\n\npartner with the necessary expertise in designing the metal ceiling system, and that this\n\nwas in fact his \"basic condition\" in determining who to work with. He further\n\nopined that if the plaintiffs' role had indeed been confined only to the manufacture and\n\nsupply of D1, D2 and D3, then there would absolutely have been no need for them to have\n\nproduced shop drawings in relation to the KLIA Project. Moreover, DW1 also referred to a\n\nmeeting between himself and PW1 at the plaintiffs' office in which DW1 had personally\n\nhanded over a ring-binder file (Exhibit D6) containing the tender documents for the\n\nKLIA Project together with the full specifications for the metal ceiling system to PW1. He\n\ntestified that PW1 left the room with the file, but came back in shortly without it. The\n\nfile was subsequently returned to DW1 only some two or three hours later, leading him to\n\nassume that the plaintiffs must have or must be taken to have made photocopies of the\n\ncontents therein.32 Reference was next made to the meeting held at the defendants'\n\noffice on 13 November 1995 (see  8 above) at which it was agreed that the plaintiffs\n\nwould appoint a Design Manager and would produce CAD drawings required by the main\n\ncontractor. Furthermore, Mr Sam Kiew Hong (PW2) of the plaintiffs, with whom the\n\ndefendants frequently dealt during the course of the Project, consistently referred to\n\nhimself as a \"Design Manager\" in all of his correspondence with the defendants.\n\nAdditionally, he had also written several letters to the defendants in which were\n\ncontained illustrations and comments on how the components of the suspension system should\n\nbest be affixed. Furthermore, reliance was also placed on PW2's admission in court that he\n\nwas the one who had determined for the spacing between the carrier rails to be fixed at\n\n1.2m. All this, the defendants contended, was evidence that the plaintiffs were actively\n\ninvolved in making recommendations on the design and dimensions of the ceiling system.33 With respect to the letter of intent dated 13 January 1996, DW1\n\nexplained that he had used the words 'subject to satisfactory negotiation of terms and\n\nconditions' to mean that only conditions relating to price and the terms of payment were\n\nleft outstanding at that time. In his view, the agreement to design had already been\n\nconfirmed and as such, there was no need to negotiate further on this.34 Finally, the defendants relied on the expert evidence of DW2 to show\n\nthat the design of the metal ceiling system was faulty and that the system provided by the\n\nplaintiffs was not fit for its purpose. It was not in dispute that DW2 did not attend any\n\nof the tests carried out by J A Shillinglaw & Associates in Hong Kong. He had the\n\nopportunity however to examine the reports and results of those tests and gave his opinion\n\nin the form of a written report dated 18 October 1999 which was exhibited to his affidavit\n\nof evidence-in-chief. In his report, DW2 opined that the design of the metal ceiling\n\nsystem at the KLIA was deficient in two respects:(a) The strength of the clip connections between the ceiling strips and\n\n  the carrier rails was inadequate; and(b) The carrier rails were not strong enough to span the 1.2m distance\n\n  or spacing between their supports.Strenuous objection was taken by counsel for the plaintiffs with\n\nrespect to the admissibility of this evidence on the ground that it was an opinion based\n\non hearsay evidence as the makers of the Shillinglaw reports were not called to testify.\n\nAs before, I shall revert to this point again later in my judgment.35 In court, DW2 gave evidence that the design code normally used in\n\nMalaysia to establish design wind pressures is the British Standard Code of Practice,\n\nChapter V Part 2 and that this would normally be within the knowledge of any civil\n\nengineer in Malaysia doing design work. In DW2's view, the design wind speed that is\n\nnormally adopted for use in Malaysia, albeit not specified in any construction regulation,\n\nis 30 m/s. It was also added that it is standard industry practice for the party designing\n\nan external metal ceiling system to take into account prevailing wind pressures in the\n\narea.Claim for late delivery of capping profiles36 In support of this claim, the defendants relied on a fax written by\n\nPW1 to the defendants dated 7 May 1997 in which PW1 expressly admitted that there was a\n\ndelay in the delivery of the capping profiles due to a \"production mistake in the\n\nfactory\". When cross-examined on this in court, PW1 conceded that this must have been\n\nthe case, given that he had written the fax himself.Claim for late delivery of documents37 The defendants contended that the terms of shipment and delivery\n\nwere CIF Port Klang in Malaysia. An endorsement printed on Purchase Order No.\n\nITC/GEMA/P/035 required all shipments to be made between 1 November 1996 and 31 May 1997.\n\nWhilst conceding that all the containers of goods did in fact arrive before or within the\n\nmonth of May 1997, it was nevertheless submitted that this was not a sufficient discharge\n\nof a seller's obligations under a CIF contract. In the defendants' view, the obligations\n\nof the plaintiffs in this case could only be said to have been fulfilled when the relevant\n\nbills of lading and insurance policies were actually handed over to the defendants. As\n\nsome of these documents were only received after May 1997, the defendants submitted that\n\nthere was breach of the CIF terms of the contract on the part of the plaintiffs.Plaintiffs' defence to counterclaim38 The plaintiffs denied that an agreement was ever reached between the\n\nparties in which the plaintiffs had agreed to undertake the structural design and\n\nengineering of the KLIA Project in accordance with the specifications of the sub-contract\n\ndocuments. It was submitted that it is the court's duty to ascertain the intention of the\n\nparties from the evidence before it, and to this end, what needs to be determined is the\n\nobjective intention of the parties. Throughout the trial, considerable emphasis was placed\n\nby counsel for the plaintiffs on the fact that it was the defendants who were the\n\nnominated sub-contractors of the KLIA Project, and as such, responsibility for design of\n\nthe ceiling system must have been something within their exclusive province.39 In response to the defendants' attempt to use the plaintiffs'\n\ninvoices which prescribed a fee for 'design, engineering and draughtsman work' as evidence\n\nshowing agreement by the plaintiffs to undertake the design of the ceiling system, PW1\n\ntestified that the idea for the apportionment of costs into that for materials and that\n\nfor services originated from the defendants. He personally had no objection to this as it\n\nmeant nothing to the plaintiffs who were only concerned with the total value invoiced. PW1\n\nfurther testified in court that from his experience in the business, he imagined that the\n\ndefendants' intention in requesting for the apportionment was presumably to reduce import\n\ntaxes payable on materials in Malaysia. He added that the words 'design, engineering and\n\ndraughtsman work' used in the invoices had no particular meaning and were meant only to\n\nmake the plaintiffs' quotation or offer more competitive. He conceded however that all\n\nthis was not mentioned in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief but explained that the reason\n\nfor this omission was that he did not want to get the defendants into further trouble in\n\nview of the then fairly good relationship between the parties. PW1 also alluded to the\n\nfact that 30% of the total price of the contract amounted to nearly RM2.4m which was a\n\npreposterous sum to pay for drawings. According to the defendants' own witness DW2, the\n\nmost that he would charge for design inclusive of calculations was approximately S$100,000\n\nfor a total of 50 drawings. As such, the 30% apportioned for services in this case could\n\nnot possibly have reflected the actual services rendered. It was further implied that\n\nDW1's reasons for varying the apportionment were questionable in view of his admission\n\nthat he knew from previous experience that tax on services was generally less than tax on\n\nmaterials. Moreover, DW1 had also admitted that the defendants did in some way benefit\n\nfrom the import duty saved.40 The plaintiffs next produced a table of Profit and Loss Comparison\n\nwhich purportedly showed that there was only a mark-up of 2.08% as at the date of\n\nquotation between the 70% invoiced to the defendants for materials and the cost price at\n\nwhich the plaintiffs had purchased those materials. This, it was submitted, was before the\n\nplaintiffs' usual security factor of some 35% for exchange rate fluctuations was even\n\ntaken into account. As such, it was contended that the plaintiffs' 70% invoice could not\n\nbe a true reflection of the actual sale price of the materials to the defendants, which\n\nwas really 100% of the value stated on the defendants' purchase orders.41 PW1 also averred in his affidavit that the only responsibility which\n\nthe plaintiffs undertook in this case was to assist in designing and producing Computer\n\nAssisted Drawings (CAD). Such drawings, it was said, were mere Proposal Drawings, which\n\nwere not the equivalent of engineering or technical designs or plans. Rather, such\n\ndrawings were mere illustrations proposing the general concept of strip ceiling suspension\n\nsystems. In this case, the Proposal Drawings were produced based on instructions provided\n\nby the defendants and it was alleged that the defendants were free to and did in fact make\n\nchanges or alterations to the drawings without the prior approval of the plaintiffs. Much\n\nreliance was also placed on the fact that all the drawings produced by the plaintiffs had\n\nthe words \"for approval\" stamped on them and that the plaintiffs were\n\nconsistently described as being manufacturers only. In the same vein, PW2 also gave\n\nevidence that he was only employed as a designer and a draughtsman and was not a\n\nprofessional engineer by training. The difference between a mere draughtsman and an\n\nengineer was recognised by DW1 who himself testified that a drawing done by a draughtsman\n\ncould not be regarded as sound or safe until an engineer had certified it to be so. PW2\n\nadmitted however that it was he who had suggested that the carrier rails in this case be\n\npositioned at a distance or spacing of 1.2m. Nevertheless, it was alleged that the\n\ndefendants had their own Project Manager, one Mr. Y Ishino, and a full-time draughtsman,\n\none Mr Aidros Osman, both of whom could have designed or checked on the design of the\n\nmetal ceiling system. Moreover, the defendants had themselves chosen not to follow the\n\nplaintiffs' proposals for the suspension system but elected instead to source for the\n\ncomponents of the suspension system (i.e., the upper section) from their own local\n\nsuppliers. In addition, DW1 had also chosen D1, D2 and D3 himself, without having to rely\n\non PW1's advice or opinion. Thereafter, the defendants had also appointed their own firm\n\nof contractors, Decolite Industries, headed by one Dr C K Lim, a specialist ceiling\n\nconsultant, to install the entire ceiling system, which included the components D1, D2 and\n\nD3 supplied by the plaintiffs. Dr Lim, whom it was alleged was privy to most of the\n\nongoing negotiations between the parties at that time, was not called by the defendants as\n\na witness. As such, it was submitted that the court ought to draw an adverse inference\n\nagainst them.42 The plaintiffs further made the point that at no time did either\n\nparty document any agreement whereby the plaintiffs expressly agreed to design the ceiling\n\nsystem. Instead, the contemporaneous written correspondence referred only to quotations\n\nfor metal ceilingmaterials, as opposed to the metal ceilingsystem. That\n\nDW1 might have intended for both to mean the same thing was irrelevant so far as the\n\nplaintiffs were concerned as they could not be presumed to have been aware of DW1's own\n\nsubjective intention. The plaintiffs also brought forward the point that there was no\n\nwritten contract to design the system. This omission, it was said, was particularly\n\nglaring given that the value of the entire KLIA Project totalled some RM21m, coupled with\n\nthe fact that there was a comprehensive sub-contract in writing between the defendants and\n\nthe main contractor which set out in considerable detail the defendants' obligations and\n\nliabilities. Moreover, DW1 had himself admitted that it was normal practice for parties to\n\nenter into a written contract in such cases. As for the letter of intent dated 13 January\n\n1996, PW1 testified that the fact that it was stated to be subject to satisfactory\n\nnegotiation of terms and conditions showed that there was then no contract at all. As no\n\nnegotiation ever took place, it could not be said that any contract was ever entered into\n\nin pursuance of this letter of intent.43 In relation to the defendants' fax of 10 May 1996 requesting for\n\ninformation on the \"tensile load\" of certain materials and the plaintiffs' reply\n\nsaying that they could not help, the plaintiffs submitted that it was inconceivable that\n\nthe defendants or any client would simply accept such a reply and let the matter rest if\n\nthe plaintiffs were indeed employed as the engineer or designer responsible for designing\n\nthe metal ceiling system. The fact that the defendants were content not to pursue the\n\nmatter further showed that the plaintiffs could not have been appointed as engineers in\n\ncharge of designing the ceiling system. Reference was also made to a fax dated 27 March\n\n1996 in which the plaintiffs had expressly informed the defendants that the latter's\n\nrequest for technical details and static calculations far exceeded what the plaintiffs as\n\nmetal ceiling manufacturers were bound to provide. It was further stated in the said fax:… [W]e are not an civil\n\n  engineer office to give calculation into the market. We have done test according to the\n\n  German DIN norm system, and therefore will guarantee certain facts.But in no way do we give know-how for calculations or\n\n  manufacturing/design into the market, if for example a certain dead load is requested we\n\n  either confirm that our ceiling system has been tested for it or is unable to comply. But\n\n  we do not provide calculation details.It was submitted that the above showed that the plaintiffs were only a\n\nsupplier of metal ceiling materials, and that the provision of a draughtsman was merely\n\nincidental. The plaintiffs further relied on a Durability Warranty for materials issued by\n\nthem to the defendants at the latter's request. It was contended that as the warranty\n\nextended only tomaterials, there could not possibly have been an assumption of\n\nresponsibility for designing thesystemon the plaintiffs' part.44 Counsel for the plaintiffs further submitted that little reliance\n\nshould be placed on the alleged verbal or oral assurance by the plaintiffs that they could\n\ndesign the metal ceiling system, or to the effect that it was \"no worry, no\n\nproblem\". First, it was contended that mere oral testimony unsubstantiated by\n\ndocumentary proof was necessarily subject to the failings of memory and the passage of\n\ntime. This problem was further compounded in the present case in view of DW1's limited\n\ngrasp of the English language. At the trial, counsel for the plaintiffs attacked DW1's\n\ncompetency, or the lack thereof, in the English language. It was DW1's own testimony that\n\nat the start of the parties' negotiations in 1995, he could understand about 70% or 80% of\n\nthe oral English in an ordinary conversation. Moreover, the fact that a Japanese\n\ninterpreter had to be present in court to assist DW1 in his testimony must be taken as\n\nfurther indication that the actual degree of his ability to express himself clearly in the\n\nEnglish language was in serious doubt. As such, any form of communication emanating from\n\nDW1, whether in written form or orally made, should be treated with circumspection by the\n\ncourt. In particular, it was pertinent that DW1 did not refer to any alleged oral\n\nassurance by PW1 in any of his faxes to the plaintiffs after the strip ceilings fell.45 With respect to the defendants' assertion that they had no choice\n\nbut to trust the plaintiffs as the latter refused to disclose crucial material data and\n\ntechnical information, the plaintiffs relied on DW1's admission that the defendants\n\nalready had possession of samples of D1, D2 and D3 from as early as December 1995 or\n\nJanuary 1996. Furthermore, the defendants had thereafter built their own mock-up using D1,\n\nD2 and D3 and locally-obtained materials for the suspension system. Counsel for the\n\nplaintiffs even went so far as to suggest that DW1 could in any event have obtained any\n\nraw material data which he required directly and personally from the plaintiffs' factories\n\nin Europe by himself! Alternatively, the defendants could and should have engaged their\n\nown civil engineer to verify and calculate if the metal ceiling system met the wind speed\n\nrequirement of 35.5 m/s. Such an engineer would then have been able to arrange for the\n\nappropriate wind loading or other test to be carried out to determine if the requirements\n\nof the sub-contract were met, and if necessary, to build a mock-up of the entire ceiling\n\nand subject it to a wind-tunnel test similar to that which was done in Hong Kong after the\n\nincidents.46 Reliance was next placed on DW1's admission that wind speed\n\nrequirement was an important design consideration. Despite the importance of this to him,\n\nDW1 confirmed that he did not highlight the specific wind speed requirement of 35.5 m/s to\n\nthe plaintiffs because he assumed that it was a common thing which PW1 ought to have\n\nknown. While PW1 did not deny that DW1 did indeed hand over an entire file of documents (Exhibit\n\nD6) to him at his office, it was asserted that there was no written acknowledgement or\n\nrecord of exactly what documents were contained in the file at the time it was handed\n\nover. PW1 further testified that he only took copies of those pages relating to the\n\nmanufacturing requirements of ceiling materials and did not recall seeing any wind speed\n\nrequirement. In any event, even if he had seen such a requirement, he would not have paid\n\nmuch regard to it as the plaintiffs were merely suppliers of D1, D2 and D3. Hence, it\n\ncould not be said that the defendants had made known to the plaintiffs their intention to\n\nuse D1, D2 and D3 in a metal ceiling system which was capable of withstanding a wind speed\n\nof 35.5m/s.47 It was further submitted that even if the plaintiffs were\n\nresponsible for designing the ceiling system, the maximum wind speed which they would have\n\ncatered for was only 30 m/s, which according to DW2, was the design speed normally adopted\n\nfor use in Malaysia, and not 35.5 m/s.48 Finally, it was asserted that DW1 was a resourceful person, capable\n\nand competent enough to secure a contract as valuable as the KLIA Project for his company.\n\nBeing a man of business, it was reiterated that if there had indeed been a contract for\n\ndesign of the metal ceiling system, such contract would certainly have been documented in\n\nwriting by DW1. In view of the fact that no such written contract was entered into, it was\n\nsubmitted that the only probable inference must be that there was no agreement to design\n\nthe system in the first place.49 In answer to the defendants' claim for late delivery of documents,\n\nPW1 testified that the plaintiffs had used their best efforts to obtain the necessary\n\nshipping and other documents from the relevant third parties as soon as possible. In any\n\ncase, the defendants had failed to adduce any evidence showing that there was in fact any\n\ndelay at all in the delivery of the documents. As a matter of law, a CIF seller's only\n\nobligation is to make every reasonable exertion to send the bill of lading as soon as\n\npossible after he has shipped the cargo to the consignee. As such, the plaintiffs cannot\n\nbe blamed for any delay due to the fault of third parties over whom the plaintiffs had no\n\ncontrol.The issues(1) Was there a contract for design between the parties?50 There was no doubt that the parties in this case did not enter into\n\nany written agreement, whether for the sale and supply of the metal ceiling materials, or\n\nfor the design of the metal ceiling system. Any contract between them must thus be\n\ncollected from the words and documents which have passed between them. An acceptance by\n\none party of the other's offer may also be inferred from the conduct of the former. The\n\ntask of inferring an assent and of fixing the precise moment at which a meeting of the\n\nminds may be said to have emerged is one of obvious difficulty, particularly when, as in\n\nthis case, the negotiations and relationship between the parties have stretched over a\n\nlong period of time and there were also numerous correspondence and meetings. The function\n\nof the judge nevertheless is to try, as far as practical experience allows, to ensure that\n\nthe reasonable expectations of honest men are not disappointed. For this purpose, the law\n\nadopts an objective test of agreement. The classic formulation of the principle was stated\n\nby Blackburn J inSmith v Hughes(1871) LR 6 QB 597 as follows:If, whatever a man's real\n\n  intention may be, he so conducts himself that a reasonable man would believe that he was\n\n  assenting to the terms proposed by the other party, and that other party upon that belief\n\n  enters into the contract with him, the man thus conducting himself would be equally bound\n\n  as if he had intended to agree to the other party's terms.Locally, inSAL Industrial Leasing Ltd v Teck Koon (Motor) Trading\n\n(a firm)[1998] 2 SLR 325, the Court of Appeal held that the question whether or not\n\nthere was an intention by the parties to enter into a legally binding contract was an\n\nobjective one. The following passage fromR v Lord Chancellor`s Department, ex p Nangle[1991] ICR 743at p 751 was quoted with approval:[I]n our judgment, that the\n\n  question whether there is an intention to create legal relations is to be ascertained\n\n  objectively, and where the terms of the relationship are, as here, to be derived solely\n\n  from the documents, depends upon the construction of those documents. It is possible for a\n\n  party to believe mistakenly that he is contractually bound to another when in fact he is\n\n  not; and conversely to believe that he is not when he is. His belief is immaterial. While\n\n  this remains a subjective belief uncommunicated to the other party, this is plainly\n\n  correct. But where such a belief is expressed in the documents it must be a question of\n\n  construction of the documents as a whole what effect should be given to such a statement.To this I would add that the contemporaneous conduct of the parties, in\n\naddition to documents, can and should also be taken into account in order to determine the\n\nexistence of an agreement between the parties: see e.g.,Harvey v Johnson(1848) 6\n\nCB 305;Brogden v Metropolitan Railway(1877) 2 App Cas 666.51 Applying the above principles to the present case, I found that\n\nthere was ample evidence to support the defendants' contention that there was a contract\n\nfor design of the metal ceiling system between the parties. In the first place, it was\n\nclear that the plaintiffs had separately invoiced the defendants for 'design, engineering\n\nand draughtsman work'. DW1, whom I found to be a truthful witness, testified that both the\n\nplaintiffs and defendants agreed to apportion the sums payable by the defendants to the\n\nplaintiffs into costs for materials, and costs for services in the proportion 70:30. On\n\nthis apportionment, the total amount charged to the defendants for design and engineering\n\nservices was some RM1.5m, not RM2.4m as PW1 seemed to have suggested in court. Clearly the\n\nreasonable inference to be drawn from this is that some responsibility for design and\n\nengineering must have been undertaken by the plaintiffs. PW1 himself, in his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief, did not deny that the invoice billing of 30% was for services rendered.\n\nHis explanation then was that the term 'design, engineering and draughtsman work' was\n\nmerely a commonly used or standard phrase which described PW2's proposal drawings, but\n\nwhich did not cover responsibility for design work. In court, PW1 sought to alter his\n\nstory by stating that the request to split the costs into that for supply and that for\n\ndesign emanated from the defendants, whose purpose was to reduce the amount of import tax\n\npayable by them in Malaysia. I found this explanation to be completely unsubstantiated on\n\nthe facts. In the first place, it was the plaintiffs who, in their initial quotation in\n\nwriting to the defendants dated 23 November 1995, stated that the price for materials\n\nsupply and 'technical and drawing service' was split into the proportion 80:20. Further,\n\nthe reason given by PW1 for the defendants' alleged request for the price apportionment\n\nwas not documented in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. His feeble explanation that the\n\nreason for the omission was that he did not want to get the defendants into further\n\ntrouble was thus unworthy of belief. By the time this action was commenced on 25 November\n\n1998, the KLIA was already fully operational and it may be assumed that there was no\n\nlonger a working relationship between the parties. Having started this litigation in the\n\nfirst place, it is unbelievable that PW1 or the plaintiffs would have had any qualms about\n\ngetting the defendants into trouble. If it was indeed true that the defendants were\n\nconcerned about wanting to reduce or avoid import taxes, such an important fact would have\n\nbeen crucial or at least greatly relevant to the plaintiffs' defence to the defendants'\n\ncounterclaim. As such, there was no reason for PW1 not to have mentioned it in his\n\naffidavit.52 In any event, PW1, under cross-examination, agreed that any tax\n\nsaving between an apportionment of 80:20 and 70:30 was only a meagre 2%, the result of\n\nwhich is that little monetary benefit would have accrued to the defendants upon the\n\nre-apportionment. In my opinion, the words 'The price reduction for supply only without\n\nanytechnicaland drawingservicewould be 20%' as contained in PW1's fax of\n\n23 November 1995 plainly revealed an implied offer on the part of the plaintiffs to do\n\ndesign and engineering work for the defendants. In my view, 'technical service' would\n\nencompass 'design and engineering services'. This offer was subsequently accepted by the\n\ndefendants who accepted and paid for the invoices issued by the plaintiffs in respect of\n\n'design, engineering and draughtsman work'.53 I accepted DW1's evidence that the defendants' reason for changing\n\nthe apportionment from 80:20 to 70:30 was so that the defendants could have a larger\n\nsafety margin to hold back payment in the event of problems with their suppliers. This was\n\nin fact corroborated by a fax written by PW1 on 26 November 1996 confirming that payment\n\nfor invoices comprising 70% of the total cost would be made via L/C while the remaining\n\n30% for design, engineering and draughtsman work would be invoiced on a normal telegraphic\n\ntransfer basis. I also found it reasonable that the defendants' main concern at that time\n\nwas for the entire price of the contract to be within the overall budget, and that it did\n\nnot really matter to them how the costs for materials and services were split. Counsel for\n\nthe plaintiffs attempted to suggest that the 70:30 arrangement was a sham as RM1.5m was a\n\npreposterous sum to be charging for design and technical service. In my view, this\n\nargument plainly ignored the fact that the true amount charged for services as originally\n\nproposed by the plaintiffs was actually 20% of the total price, i.e., RM1m, which by any\n\nmeasure is a substantial fee. While it is true that DW2 testified that the normal amount\n\nchargeable for the design services rendered in this case was around S$100,000, this was,\n\nin my view, only DW2's own personal opinion as to what he himself would charge if he was\n\nassigned to undertake purely design work. DW2's estimate did not include attendances at\n\nsite meetings. It was thus natural for the plaintiffs, an internationally-recognised\n\npremier organisation, to charge a premium for the design, engineering and draughtsman\n\nservices for their proprietary ceiling system. I accepted DW1's evidence that the\n\ndefendants had no experience whatsoever in what to my mind was a specialised type of\n\nsuspended ceiling intended for construction at the KLIA. As such, DW1 would hardly have\n\nbeen aware of the usual or market price for the design of such ceilings, if there was even\n\na market for such a proprietary type of ceiling in the first place. In DW1's view, he had\n\na fixed overall budget to keep to, and so long as the total cost fell within that amount,\n\nthere was really nothing else for him to be concerned with.54 With respect to the table of Profit and Loss Comparison (Exhibit\n\nP6) relied on by the plaintiffs, this was tendered to the court only at the end of the\n\ntrial in response to my earlier request for evidence of invoices from the plaintiffs'\n\nsuppliers in Germany. I had asked for this in order to determine if the amount invoiced to\n\nthe defendants in respect of materials only was realistic after taking into account the\n\nplaintiffs' cost of sales.Exhibit P6revealed, from a side-by-side comparison of\n\nsuppliers' invoices and the invoices issued by the plaintiffs, that the plaintiffs' profit\n\nmargin from materials was only 2.08% based on an apportionment of 70:30 i.e.\n\nplaintiffs’ invoiced price to defendants for materials being 70% of the contract\n\nprice and the plaintiffs’ own cost price being 68.57% of the contract price would\n\ngive a 2.08% profit margin. As the profit margin could not possibly be so low as 2.08%,\n\ncounsel for the plaintiffs therefore submitted that the amount actually invoiced to the\n\ndefendants for materials should not be 70% but in reality, should have been 100% of the\n\ncontract price without any deduction in the contract price of 30% (or more accurately\n\n31.43% based on these calculations) for 'design, engineering and draughtsman work', which\n\nthe plaintiffs alleged to be nothing but a sham. Assuming that the plaintiffs were correct\n\nin this regard, the plaintiffs’ profit margin purely in respect of materials supply\n\nwould then soar to 45.83%. This the plaintiffs submitted was more realistic than 2.08%. In\n\nan attempt to explain away part of this extraordinarily large profit margin of 45.83%, it\n\nwas further alleged that the plaintiffs' usual provision for exchange rate fluctuations\n\nwas some 35%. In my view, this evidence was plainly unbelievable. In the first place, the\n\nsuggestion that a 35% security factor was provisioned for exchange rate fluctuations was\n\nludicrous and completely out of line with normal business practice especially when the\n\ncontract between the plaintiffs and defendants was finalised well before the recent asian\n\ncurrency crisis, and I very much doubted that a reasonable businessman would have made\n\nprovisions for or envisaged currency exchange rates fluctuations in the RM, S$, Sfr, and\n\nDM in the range of 35%. In my view, the invoices issued by the plaintiffs to the\n\ndefendants in respect of materials should have been 80% of the total price charged to the\n\ndefendants. That was how the plaintiffs had originally priced their materials. This 80%\n\nwas however subsequently reduced to 70% on paper, because of the defendants' wish for a\n\nlarger safety margin in respect of payment. Nevertheless, this did not affect the overall\n\namount which the plaintiffs had in fact charged for materials, which remained at 80% of\n\nthe total amount invoiced to the defendants, and the remaining 20% was in truth charged\n\nfor substantive 'design, engineering and draughtsman work'. On this view, the plaintiffs'\n\ntotal profit margin in respect of materials would work out to be around 16.66% (i.e. based\n\non 80/68.57 X 100%), which in my opinion, was certainly more realistic than a 45.83%\n\nprofit margin. A plausible supposition would be that some 10-12% of the total profit\n\nmargin of 16.66% accounted for the plaintiffs' mark-up in respect of sales alone while the\n\nremaining 4-6% represented provision for exchange rate fluctuations, which to my mind was\n\nfar more reasonable than a provision of some 35%. In the result, I had no doubt that the\n\ninvoices issued in respect of 'design, engineering and draughtsman work' were genuine at\n\nleast up to an amount of 20% and the defendants were indeed billed for substantial design,\n\nengineering and draughtsman work done by the plaintiffs. I did not think that the\n\ninvoicing for 'design, engineering and draughtsman work' was merely a faade or a\n\nfraudulent and illegal scheme by the defendants to evade import taxes as alleged by the\n\nplaintiffs.55 Next, it was also not disputed that the plaintiffs produced shop\n\ndrawings in respect of the KLIA Project, a fact which showed that the plaintiffs were\n\nclearly acting in performance of an earlier-concluded agreement to design, or at the very\n\nleast, that they were conducting themselves in a manner which was consistent with their\n\nearlier offer to provide design services as may be gleaned from the plaintiffs' fax of 23\n\nNovember 1995. The shop drawings provided by the plaintiffs were adopted for use by the\n\ndefendants to install the metal ceiling system at the KLIA and were in turn handed over by\n\nthem to the main contractor and thereafter to the airport authorities for approval. DW2,\n\nthe defendants' expert witness, upon examining the drawings produced by the plaintiffs,\n\nopined that they were in essence engineering or technical designs and plans. No expert\n\nevidence was led by the plaintiffs to refute this. In the premises, I accepted DW2's\n\nevidence that the shop drawings produced by the plaintiffs were engineering or technical\n\ndesigns or plans. From my own perusal of these drawings, it was clear that the structural\n\nelements of the ceiling system as well as the respective sizes and spacings of the\n\nindividual components were all set out in considerable detail. In my view, only the party\n\nin charge of designing the system would have taken it upon himself to state in such\n\nprecise terms the dimensions of the individual components and other measurements between\n\neach component in the system. The width and thickness of the material to be used for each\n\ncomponent of the system had been explicitly set out in the key to all the drawings.\n\nClearly, these drawings could not possibly have been mere \"Proposal Drawings\"\n\nintended only for the purposes of providing a rough or vague concept of the system or a\n\ngeneral manner of installation. There is no doubt that the production of the drawings in\n\nquestion must have involved extensive work, calculation and responsibility, which to my\n\nmind, would only have been done by a party tasked with the duty of designing the system.\n\nPW1's assertion that the complex, detailed, and to-scale drawings given by the plaintiffs\n\nto the defendants was merely a goodwill gesture was thus completely unbelievable.56 I was fortified in the above view by the fact that CP100 is a\n\nproprietary system. The shop drawings themselves stated clearly that the plaintiffs claim\n\nproprietary rights in the information disclosed therein. As such, it would have been\n\nimpossible for the defendants, even if they had wanted to, to seek confirmation or\n\nverification with their own firm of engineers on the structural integrity of D1, D2 and D3\n\nwhen fitted together as a system, having regard to their profiles, dimensions, spacings,\n\nmethod of clipping, and the wind loading that the system ought to be capable of\n\nwithstanding. Without information on the grade of the material or components used for the\n\nsystem and material properties like tensile strength, which information the plaintiffs did\n\nnot disclose, calculations on structural integrity could not be done. DW2 testified that\n\nD1, D2 and D3 were all proprietary components, a fact which was attested to by PW1\n\nhimself. Of course, it would have been open to the defendants to carry out their own\n\nmaterial load testing on D1, D2 and D3 in order to obtain the necessary technical data\n\nwhich would enable independent engineers to verify the structural integrity of D1, D2 and\n\nD3 when fitted together. But in my view, this was not a reasonable solution in the\n\ncircumstances and not one in which the defendants were obliged to take, given the very\n\nsubstantial fee that the plaintiffs had charged for design services. Having paid a\n\nhandsome design fee, I think it was reasonable for the defendants to have assumed that D1,\n\nD2 and D3, when installed as an integrated system in accordance with the shop drawings of\n\nthe plaintiffs would be safe and capable of withstanding the required design wind loads.\n\nDW2's expert evidence as documented in the report exhibited to his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief was that proprietary systems utilise components and connection details\n\nwhich are specifically developed by the manufacturer for each application. They are not\n\nassembled from separate standard structural sections which can be purchased from different\n\nsources. In DW2's view, proprietary systems are specially designed systems built by a\n\nmanufacturer and only they would have the knowledge or information on the characteristics\n\nor strength of each individual part to the exclusion of others. Should others wish to\n\nutilise the system, they would have to rely on the manufacturer for the requisite\n\ninformation on the relevant characteristics or strengths. No expert witness was called by\n\nthe plaintiffs to displace these propositions which I acceptedin toto.57 It was also significant that the defendants did in fact attempt to\n\nobtain crucial technical information from the plaintiffs but none whatsoever was\n\nforthcoming from the latter. In the faxes dated 10 and 13 May 1996 referred to above,\n\nconsecutive requests for technical information were made by DW1 to the plaintiffs. No\n\nsatisfactory reply however emanated from the plaintiffs. In my view, this constant refusal\n\nto divulge important information supported the inference that the plaintiffs had\n\nundertaken full responsibility for designing the system. It might be supposed that by\n\nrefusing to give information which would have allowed the defendants to conduct their own\n\ntests or checks, the plaintiffs were in fact impliedly warranting that installation of D1,\n\nD2 and D3 in accordance with their shop drawings could be adopted wholesale by the\n\ndefendants and no modifications were necessary. The earlier fax of 27 March 1996 written\n\nby PW1 to the effect that the plaintiffs did not give know-how for calculations for\n\nmanufacturing or design into the market also provided strong evidence of the fact that the\n\nplaintiffs had the necessary load test data needed to design the ceilings for the required\n\nloadings. The reason why they did not provide this information to the defendants was\n\nbecause they regarded it as confidential and commercially sensitive data. Contrary to the\n\nplaintiffs' view that this fax negatived the existence of an agreement to design on their\n\npart, I found that it was precisely because they did not divulge certain information that\n\nthey must be taken to have impliedly assumed responsibility for the rest of the\n\ninformation which they did in fact provide, as there was otherwise no reasonably\n\npracticable way for the defendants to verify the dimensions and installation details in\n\nthe shop drawings supplied by the plaintiffs. DW2's expert opinion after all was that a\n\nthird party, without the relevant technical data, would not have been able to calculate\n\nand determine the loading capacity of a proprietary ceiling system with any degree of\n\naccuracy. In my view, it was absurd for the plaintiffs to expect that the defendants\n\nshould have conducted their own load tests to obtain the relevant data, given that the\n\nformer had already charged an almost exorbitant fee for design services, and that the\n\ndefendants themselves had a fixed budget to adhere to.A fortiori, the suggestion\n\nthat the defendants should have built their own full-scale mock-up to test the system\n\nbefore installing it was both ridiculous and completely unreasonable in the circumstances.\n\nTo my mind, where A has contracted with B to design a system, then in the absence of\n\nfurther provision, B is entitled to assume that A had performed his duties under the\n\ncontract properly. The concept of responsibility would become superfluous if B had to\n\nconstantly double-check on whether or not A had accomplished its side of the bargain. Take\n\nfor example the case where I ask an architect and a civil engineer to design a house for\n\nme. Thereafter I build the house according to the design supplied by them. The house later\n\ncollapses and it is revealed that their design was flawed. Can it be that I should\n\nthereafter have no recourse against them because I ought to have hired another architect\n\nand civil engineer to conduct a separate, independent check on the design before building\n\nthe house? I think this clearly cannot be the position at law. In any case, it must be\n\nremembered that the plaintiffs' failure in the present case to divulge information was not\n\nbecause they did not have the necessary expertise to do so nor were they unqualified in\n\nthis respect, as counsel for the plaintiff suggested in his closing arguments. On the\n\ncontrary, as their business catalogue and ISO 9001 Certificate revealed, the Gema group is\n\nworld-renowned for its design and engineering expertise. I can only surmise that the\n\nreason for the non-disclosure in this case was because the plaintiffs were concerned with\n\nprotecting their proprietary rights in the material and the system as a whole, not because\n\nthey were not competent to give the necessary calculations or data. As a result, the\n\ndefendants had no other practical alternative but to rely fully on the drawings and\n\ndimensions supplied by the plaintiffs. The same can also be said about the mock-up of the\n\nceiling system built by the defendants using D1, D2 and D3 and locally-obtained suspension\n\ncomponents. In my view, this was done more to ensure the general functionality of the\n\nsystem as a whole and to observe its overall aesthetic quality. I did not think that the\n\ndefendants ever intended for this mock-up to be used as a test of the structural integrity\n\nof the design of the system as supplied by the plaintiffs. In any case, as I have found,\n\nit was neither reasonable nor practicable for the defendants, or for the plaintiffs to\n\nexpect the defendants to conduct their own wind-loading or wind-tunnel tests on the\n\nmock-up, given that the plaintiffs had withheld crucial technical information on the\n\nstrengths and characteristics of the materials supplied. In the same vein, I also attached\n\nno weight to the manufacturer's note printed on the shop drawings supplied by the\n\nplaintiffs, stating that all dimensions were to be checked by the sub-contractor prior to\n\nmanufacture and installation. To me, this was merely a standard phrase pre-printed on the\n\nshop drawing sheets as a matter of course. As the statement was inconsistent with the\n\nconduct of the plaintiffs in refusing to divulge crucial information necessary for the\n\ndimensions to be verified, I found that the note could not have the effect of altering the\n\nfact that responsibility for design lay with the plaintiffs throughout. The position with\n\nrespect to the words \"for approval\" on the shop drawings was likewise no\n\ndifferent. In any case, I accepted DW2's expert opinion that the words \"for\n\napproval\" referred to the approval of the airport authority's consultants, which\n\napproval, if given, did not ordinarily encompass responsibility for design and dimensions.58 Counsel for the plaintiffs also sought to play up the fact that DW1\n\ndid not take issue with the plaintiffs' refusal to provide information and merely let the\n\nmatter rest as it was. He submitted that if the plaintiffs had indeed been tasked with\n\ndesigning the system, then a client's likely response would have been to send a nasty\n\nletter reminding the designers and/or engineers of their appointment and demanding an\n\nanswer. In my view, this submission was completely without merit. I think it was clear\n\nfrom the documentary evidence that repeated requests for information had been made by DW1\n\nto the plaintiffs. Each request however was consistently met with the same response from\n\nthe plaintiffs to the effect that they could not divulge the necessary information. In\n\nfact, DW1 testified that he had, upon receiving the non-committal response from the\n\nplaintiffs, spoken to PW1 over the phone querying if the ceiling system could withstand\n\nthe \"situation of the Project\", to which PW1 had replied \"no worry, no\n\nproblem\". Moreover, DW1 had also earlier enquired of PW1 if the plaintiffs could\n\ndesign the metal ceiling system to which the latter had replied in the affirmative. Having\n\nobserved the demeanour of DW1 in the witness box, I found that he was a truthful witness,\n\nwho, despite his slight handicap in the English language, was nevertheless able to\n\nexpressly himself with sufficient clarity. In this respect, I also found the plaintiffs'\n\nattacks on DW1's competency in the English language to be completely unwarranted. Despite\n\nhaving engaged the services of a Japanese language interpreter to assist him in court, DW1\n\nchose to and did in fact give most of his evidence in English, without the aid of the\n\ninterpreter at all. I recognised that most of the written correspondence and oral\n\ncommunication between the parties in this case occurred between 1995 and 1996.\n\nNevertheless, I accepted DW1's evidence that his grasp of English at that time was around\n\n\"70 to 80%\", which to my mind, was sufficient for him to accurately convey his\n\nintentions to the plaintiffs in simple English. A perusal of some of the letters or faxes\n\nwritten by DW1 during the relevant period revealed that his command of the English\n\nlanguage, even in writing, was no where as lamentable as the plaintiffs would have me\n\nbelieve. I found that DW1 was able to express himself clearly and to a reasonable degree\n\nof preciseness. While errors in grammar were no doubt present, this did not in any way\n\naffect the substance of what DW1 intended to convey, and any reasonable person looking at\n\nthe documents written by him would have little difficulty understanding their purport and\n\nscope.A fortiori, I think the reasonable inference must be that DW1's grasp of\n\nspoken or oral English must have been of an equal standard, if not higher. In the\n\npremises, I accepted DW1's evidence that PW1 had orally assured him that it was not a\n\nproblem for the plaintiffs to design the ceiling system and that the system as designed by\n\nthe plaintiffs could withstand \"the situation of the Project\". In fact, if PW1\n\nhad said anything otherwise in response to DW1's query, then I think as a matter of common\n\nsense, the defendants would thereafter have terminated their working relationship with the\n\nplaintiffs. After all, they had specifically discontinued discussions with Chicago\n\nMetallic precisely because the latter could not undertake the design of the 3-D ceiling\n\nsystem at the KLIA. As such, I found that it was reasonable for the defendants, after\n\nhaving met with continuous refusals to divulge critical information, to assume that the\n\nplaintiffs were legitimately seeking to protect their proprietary rights, and to rely on\n\nthe shop drawings and dimensions specified by the plaintiffs. That the defendants had\n\nrequested for the information in the first place did not have the effect of casting\n\nresponsibility for design on their shoulders. Rather, it merely allowed them the\n\nopportunity of carrying out their own independent checks or verifications on the\n\nspecifications supplied, which they were fully entitled to do. This did not however change\n\nthe fact that responsibility for design rested with the plaintiffs. At this point, I\n\nshould also state that I found the plaintiffs' argument that no weight should be placed on\n\nPW1's alleged oral assurances because this was not specifically pleaded in the defence and\n\ncounterclaim to be wholly unsustainable. I did not think that the defendants did at any\n\ntime attempt to rely solely and exclusively on these one or two verbal assurances to found\n\ntheir entire cause of action. In my view, these oral assurances were merely part of the\n\noverall evidence adduced before the court from which I was asked to infer an agreement for\n\nthe plaintiffs to design.59 Further evidence of the existence of a contract for design can be\n\ngarnered from the fact that the defendants had passed Architectural Drawings supplied by\n\nthe main contractor onto the plaintiffs. If the plaintiffs' assertion that their only\n\nresponsibility was to supply D1, D2 and D3 to the defendants, then there would have been\n\nabsolutely no need for the Architectural Drawings to be passed to the plaintiffs, nor\n\nwould it have been necessary for them to produce detailed shop drawings specifying\n\ndimensions and other highly-particularised measurements.60 It was also significant that PW2 consistently referred to himself as\n\na \"Design Manager\" in all of his correspondence with the defendants. Throughout\n\nthe trial, the plaintiffs continually tried to run the argument that their only\n\nresponsibility was to provide the defendants with a draughtsman who was in no way\n\nresponsible for the drawings which he produced and one who would only draw in accordance\n\nwith the defendants' instructions. I found this argument tenuous in the circumstances. In\n\nthe first place, if the plaintiffs' only intention had been to appoint a draughtsman, then\n\nthere would have been no reason for PW2 to have addressed himself otherwise. I think the\n\nobvious inference from the fact that PW2 called himself a \"Design Manager\" was\n\nthat both parties were agreed that the plaintiffs were responsible for designing the\n\nsystem. Moreover, to my mind, it was also improbable that PW2 had to take instructions\n\nfrom the defendants in designing the metal ceiling system given, as I have alluded to in\n\nthe preceding paragraphs, that all the necessary technical data and load test results were\n\nwithin the exclusive province of the plaintiffs. At this juncture, I should also highlight\n\nthe point made by DW1 that it was the plaintiffs who had proposed the appropriate\n\nthickness of the metal strip ceiling to be used, thus impliedly warranting the strength,\n\nand hence capacity of the system as a whole. A thinner strip ceiling would obviously not\n\nsecure as well onto the carrier rails as a stronger and thicker strip ceiling since the\n\nsecuring depended on the curved edges of the strip ceiling holding on to the hooks or\n\nclip-ins on the carrier rails. It was further admitted by PW1 himself that the plaintiffs\n\nalso advised on the suitable thickness of the capping profiles to be used. In addition,\n\ndetailed illustrations of the way in which the components of the suspension system should\n\nbe installed were also forwarded to the defendants. It was clear from all this that the\n\nplaintiffs were at all times actively involved in the details of the entire ceiling\n\nsystem. Their efforts in explaining to the defendants how the suspension system should be\n\ninstalled went beyond the duties of a mere supplier of materials. What was also telling\n\nwas the fact that it was the plaintiffs who had determined the appropriate spacing between\n\nthe carrier rails, which to me, was an important element of the structural integrity of\n\nthe design. It is incredible that a mere supplier would actually be involved in making\n\ncrucial technical decisions like these, particularly when such decisions involved integral\n\ndesign components of the metal ceiling system. I rejected the plaintiffs' suggestion that\n\nPW2 could not have been tasked with making detailed engineering drawings as he was not a\n\nprofessional engineer by training. PW2 himself testified that he had a certificate in\n\ndrafting and basic design concepts and was at all times working under the supervision of\n\none Mr Kevin Butler, whom I understood to be PW2's boss and who was also involved in\n\ndesigning the system. In the absence of further clarification from the plaintiffs, I\n\naccepted DW1's evidence that Mr Butler contributed to the designing of the ceiling system\n\nas well, and was presumably qualified to do so.61 Counsel for the plaintiffs next sought to impress upon me the fact\n\nthat the plaintiffs had described themselves as mere suppliers in the shop drawings. I\n\nfound this argument to be completely misleading. A quick look at the shop drawings\n\nsupplied revealed that the plaintiffs did not actually describe themselves as suppliers.\n\nThey had merely filled in their name into a blank space entitled 'Manufacture' on the\n\nstandard form drawing sheet.. That they were the manufacturers of the system was certainly\n\nnot in doubt, and as such, the so-called description was not incorrect. Nevertheless, this\n\ndid not mean that they could not also have been responsible for designing the ceiling\n\nsystem, particularly when no corresponding blank or space for 'Design' was provided for on\n\nthe standard drawing sheet.62 The allegation that the defendants had modified the shop drawings\n\nsupplied by the plaintiffs was also not sustainable on the facts. DW1 confirmed that the\n\nonly time in which the drawings were modified was after the collapse of the ceilings at\n\nthe KLIA. Security clips were added to the strip ceiling in order to avert another\n\ncollapse and even then, such was done only upon consultation with the plaintiffs. Any\n\nother modification to the drawings were merely remedial measures, undertaken as part of\n\nthe rectification works which the defendants carried out after the dislodgement of the\n\nceiling strips. There was no evidence that the defendants had modified the plaintiffs'\n\nshop drawings before the incidents, or before forwarding them on to the main contractor.63 Counsel for the plaintiffs also sought to emphasise the point that\n\nDW1 had, in the letter of intent dated 13 January 1996, used the words 'intention to enter\n\ninto a contract… for the design and supplying Metal CeilingMaterials'. This,\n\ncounsel contended, showed that the defendants only intended for the plaintiffs to supplymaterials,\n\nand not to design thesystemas well. In my view, this argument was completely\n\nuntenable as it ignored the fact that the word \"design\" was also used in the\n\nsentence. The word \"design\" used in this context, could only have been a\n\nreference to a design of the system. Surely the objective intention could not have been to\n\ndesign the materials, which were really standard products pre-developed for specific\n\npurposes, and this, I had no doubt, must have been within the knowledge of PW1. In any\n\ncase, this letter of intent was but one out of many pieces of evidence which showed\n\ndistinctly the existence of an agreement to design.64 Counsel for the plaintiffs also based a large part of his arguments\n\non the assumption that the existence of a contract for design must either have been\n\nconcluded by a specified time or never at all. First, counsel sought to show that there\n\ncould not have been an agreement for design as at the date of the defendants' fax, i.e.,\n\n13 November 1995 which set out the minutes of the parties' meeting on the same day. The\n\nreason for this was because the parties had only agreed to provide a design manager to do\n\nCAD drawings, but not an engineer who was able to make technical calculations. As such, it\n\ncould not be said, based on this fax, that there was an agreement by the plaintiffs to\n\ndesign the system. Counsel then went on to make a similar point with respect to the letter\n\nof intent dated 13 January 1996. In this case, counsel sought to show that the words\n\n'subject to satisfactory negotiations of terms and conditions' indicated that there was no\n\nagreement as to price and the terms of payment and consequently, no agreement for design\n\neither. Finally, counsel also referred to various other contemporaneous correspondence\n\nwhich he claimed, showed that there was never any discussion on the structural design or\n\nengineering of the metal ceiling system.65 In my view, the above arguments were wholly misconceived. The\n\nexistence of the contract for design in this case was founded not merely upon one or two\n\npieces of correspondence between the parties. In determining whether or not there was a\n\ncontract in this case, the court must be concerned to take into account the totality of\n\nthe evidence before it. While I accepted the view that there might not have been a\n\nconcluded contract for design at the date of the letter of intent, the subsequent conduct\n\nof the parties presented unmistakable evidence that they must have reachedconsensus ad\n\nidemat some point during the entire period of the working relationship between the\n\nparties. For example, the issuance of invoices for 'design, engineering and draughtsman\n\nwork' by the plaintiffs, the production of shop drawings and the concomitant refusal to\n\ndisclose critical technical information, as well as the appointment of PW2 as a Design\n\nManager may all be taken as conduct from which an offer to provide design services may\n\nunequivocally be inferred. Consequent acceptance of this offer can be seen from the fact\n\nthat the defendants passed on relevant Architectural Drawings of the KLIA to the\n\nplaintiffs, that the contract and tender documents were also handed to the plaintiffs, and\n\nthat the defendants accepted and paid for invoices issued in respect of 'design,\n\nengineering and draughtsman work.' Alternatively, the situation may also be analysed such\n\nthat it was the defendants who had made the initial offer for the plaintiffs to design the\n\nsystem through their cumulative acts of asking PW1 whether or not the plaintiffs could\n\ndesign the system, of requiring the plaintiffs to appoint a Design Manager who would also\n\nattend site meetings, and of passing the contract documents and Architectural Drawings on\n\nto the defendants. This offer was clearly accepted by the plaintiffs via the provision of\n\nshop drawings and a Design Manager, the refusal to disclose critical technical information\n\nand the constant assertion of their proprietary rights in the system supplied, and the\n\nissuance of invoices for 'design, engineering and draughtsman work'. It is trite law that\n\nan acceptance may be by conduct. For example, an offer to buy goods may be accepted by\n\nsupplying them; an offer to sell goods may be accepted by the buyer using them, and an\n\noffer contained in a request for services may be accepted by beginning to render them: seeChitty on Contracts, Volume 1: General Principles (28thEd, 1999) at \n\n2-027. Hence, returning to the facts of the present case, whichever way one looks at it,\n\nit is clear that the mere fact that no agreement was reached by the parties at the meeting\n\non 13 November 1995 concerning the appointment of an engineer was not conclusive of the\n\nfact that there was never or that there could never be an intention for the plaintiffs to\n\nassume responsibility for design. Likewise, while the words 'subject to satisfactory\n\nnegotiation of terms and conditions' in the letter of intent might mean that there was no\n\nconcluded contract at that point in time, they do not preclude the possibility of an\n\nagreement arising subsequently. If I were to take the plaintiffs' argument to its logical\n\nconclusion, that the words 'subject to satisfactory negotiation of terms and conditions'\n\nmeant that there could not have been a concluded contract for design at that point and\n\nafter because terms relating to price and method of payment were still outstanding, then\n\nlogically, there would also never have been an agreement for the sale of materials, since\n\nthe price and other payment terms had also not been finalised with respect to materials as\n\nat the date of the letter of intent. Yet no argument was ever made of the fact that there\n\nwas a contract for the sale of materials, which unarguably was also evidenced by the\n\nsubsequent practice of issuing purchase orders and invoices respectively. In the premises,\n\nI found that the ensuing conduct of the parties in this case clearly disclosed an\n\nobjective intention that the plaintiffs were responsible for designing the metal ceiling\n\nsystem. At this juncture, I think it is also appropriate to deal with the plaintiffs'\n\nargument that it was \"striking\" that the defendants did not bother to enter into\n\na written contract for design when the value of the entire KLIA Project was some RM21m,\n\nand when there was a comprehensive nominated sub-contract between the defendants and the\n\nmain contractor. In my view, there are many ways in which a company could conduct its\n\nbusiness. The degree of trust that one party might place in another could well vary with\n\nthe reputation and track-record of the latter. Where the entity concerned is a\n\nworld-renowned organisation professing to deliver services of world-class standards, I do\n\nnot think it is unusual for men of business to rely on the oral assurances and other\n\ncontemporaneous conduct moving from that organisation. In any event, in the present case,\n\nit was not imperative that the defendants should have entered into a written agreement\n\nwith their designers or engineers just because the value of the KLIA Project was large.\n\nAfter all, they had not seen it fit to enter into a written contract for the sale of\n\nmaterials either, a fact which clearly exemplified the level of trust which they placed in\n\nthe plaintiffs. Finally, the argument that the contemporaneous correspondence contained\n\nonly requests for quotations for materials was also not borne out by the evidence. It was\n\nclear from the defendants' faxes that numerous requests were made by them for shop\n\ndrawings and PW2 did in fact supply detailed illustrations of various sections of the\n\nceiling system to the defendants. Moreover, shop drawings were also provided in due\n\ncourse. In any case, there was no need for the defendants to have requested for quotations\n\nas to the cost of design when PW1 had already, in his earlier fax of 23 November 1995,\n\nindicated that service charge would be an automatic 20% of the total quoted price and the\n\nbalance of 80% would be the price for supplying materials. As such, any negotiation on the\n\nprice of materials would directly affect the price for design, engineering and draughtsman\n\nservices.66 I move on to deal with the argument of plaintiffs' counsel that his\n\nclients could not possibly have been responsible for designing the metal ceiling system\n\nwhen they were not the nominated sub-contractor for the KLIA Project. Great emphasis was\n\nplaced by counsel on the proposition that as the defendants were the nominated\n\nsub-contractor for the KLIA Project, responsibility for design must have been theirs\n\nsolely. I found this argument to be completely fallacious and misconceived as it ignored\n\nthe basic and fundamental doctrine of privity of contract. There was never any doubt that\n\nthe defendants had all along been the nominated sub-contractor for the KLIA Project, and\n\nthat under the terms of the sub-contract, responsibility for design was that of the\n\nnominated sub-contractor. Nevertheless, the sub-contract did not prohibit the nominated\n\nsub-contractor from sub-sub-contracting its obligations out to a third party, which was\n\nwhat the defendants did in this case. While the defendants would certainly remain liable\n\nto the main contractor for any failure to fulfil their obligations under the sub-contract,\n\nincluding obligations of design, this does not affect the duties of the third party, i.e.,\n\nthe plaintiffs, to the defendants under the sub-sub-contract. As such, the fact that the\n\ndefendants were the nominated sub-contractor vis--vis the main contractor was a matter\n\nwholly separate and distinct from their relationship with the plaintiffs. In my view, any\n\nargument along the line that because the plaintiffs were not the nominated sub-contractor\n\nvis--vis the main contractor therefore they could not have been responsible for design\n\nof the system was completely untenable. In this respect, the same can also be said of the\n\nobligation contained in the nominated sub-contract on the part of the nominated\n\nsub-contractor to obtain a certificate from the plaintiffs stating that the requirements\n\nof the nominated sub-contract were all met. In my view, the failure of the defendants to\n\nobtain such a certificate from the plaintiffs might well amount to a breach of the\n\nformer's obligations to the main contractor, but this breach in no way affected the scope\n\nof the plaintiffs' duties under their own sub-sub-contract with the defendants. I think it\n\nis clear in this case that the defendants had sub-sub-contracted its obligations of design\n\nunder the nominated sub-contract to the plaintiffs. For this purpose, it was not necessary\n\nfor the use of precise words or phrases by the parties. Their conduct was more than\n\nsufficient for such an intention or agreement to be objectively inferred.67 With respect to the Durability Warranty for materials issued by the\n\nplaintiffs, I accepted DW2's undisputed evidence that no similar warranty exists in the\n\nindustry for services rendered. As such, no similar warranty for technical and engineering\n\ndesign service was given by the plaintiffs nor could one be expected to be given. Hence,\n\nthe fact that the only warranty issued in this case was one relating to materials added\n\nnothing to the plaintiffs' case.68 With regard to the allegation that the defendants had their own\n\nProject Manager, i.e., Mr Y Ishino and as such were equipped to undertake design\n\nresponsibility, I think this was adequately countered by the defendants' explanation that\n\nMr Ishino was merely an architect by training and not an engineer. As such, he was not\n\nqualified to comment on the adequacy of the structural design as detailed in the shop\n\ndrawings supplied by the plaintiffs. As for the fact that the defendants had their own\n\ndraughtsman, one Mr Aidros Osman and thereafter one Ms Hanita, I find, on the evidence,\n\nthat these persons were employed to draw a different type of ceiling for a different\n\nsection of the KLIA. Any drawing which Ms Hanita might have made in respect of the ceiling\n\nwhich is the subject-matter of the dispute in this case, was done only after the collapse\n\nof the ceiling strips, and merely as part of the overall rectification work. As for Dr C K\n\nLim of Decolite Industries, I think it was adequately explained by DW1 that the former was\n\nneither an engineer nor a metal ceiling consultant employed by the defendants. He served\n\nas a director in the defendants' company and was initially employed only for his\n\nadministrative experience in labour and payroll matters in Malaysia. After all, his\n\ndoctorate was in Agricultural Studies and Forestry, which were hardly the qualifications\n\nof an engineer. At most, I was willing to make the assumption that Dr Lim could have been\n\nroped in by the defendants to assist in the installation of the ceilings as well, but this\n\nin no way translated to his being further tasked with having to examine and give advice on\n\nengineering and other technical matters, which he was undoubtedly not qualified to give.\n\nAs such, I rejected the plaintiffs' request for me to draw an adverse inference against\n\nthe defendants for not having called Dr Lim to testify. In my view, Dr Lim's presence in\n\ncourt would not have altered the substance of the defendants' evidence.69 In the light of the foregoing reasons, I had no doubt that there was\n\nan agreement for the plaintiffs to design the metal ceiling system. The intention of the\n\nparties was plainly evident from the objective evidence before the court. In particular,\n\nthe plaintiffs' conduct throughout the relevant period showed that they had impliedly\n\nassented to undertake responsibility for design. I think any reasonable person, looking at\n\nall that had transpired between the parties during the material time would have had no\n\nhesitation in coming to the conclusion that both sides had agreed that the plaintiffs\n\nwould not only supply the materials for the KLIA Project but would also design an\n\nappropriate metal ceiling system in respect thereof.(2) What was the scope of the contract for design?70 Having found that there was a contract for design, the necessary\n\nimplication must be that the contract contained all the terms which were essential to\n\nallow it to be workable as a matter of commercial common sense:Trollope and Colls v\n\nAtomic Power Constructions[1963] 1 WLR 333 at p 337. In this case, one would imagine\n\nthat it was an implied term of the contract that the plaintiffs were to design a metal\n\nceiling system which was capable of withstanding the requirements of the KLIA Project.\n\nThere was no doubt that from the start, the plaintiffs knew that they were being engaged\n\nin connection with the KLIA Project. Next, the entire bundle of tender and sub-contract\n\ndocuments containing the requisite specifications were handed over to PW1 at a very early\n\nstage of the negotiations. Counsel for the plaintiffs attempted to suggest that as the\n\ndocuments were contained in a ring-binder file (Exhibit D6), it was possible for\n\nthe defendants to have altered its contents between the time that the file was handed over\n\nto PW1 and the time of the trial. I found this spurious suggestion to be completely\n\nspeculative and unwarranted on the evidence. In my mind, there was nothing to indicate\n\nthat PW1 did not receive the whole set of tender and sub-contract documents together with\n\nthe specifications. In fact, PW1 himself admitted that DW1 did indeed pass him a file\n\nsimilar toExhibit D6. His explanation however was that he did not make copies of\n\nthe specifications which were irrelevant to him as a manufacturer. In particular, he\n\ndenied that he had seen copies of certain wind-speed tables which were part of the\n\nsub-contract documents. Looking at all the circumstances of the case, I disbelieved this\n\npiece of evidence entirely. PW1 claimed that each specification had an index in the front\n\nwhich indicated where he, as a manufacturer could find details which were important to\n\nmanufacture and supply. Having perused the file of documents tendered asExhibit D6,\n\nI found that no such index as PW1 described existed. Rather, the various specifications\n\nwere contained in separate sections in the contract and tender documents. Each such\n\nsection was preceded by a cover page which set out in bold print the general title to the\n\nsection in question. There was a main contents page right at the top of all the documents\n\ncontained in the file, which set out the title to each separate section. With respect to\n\nthe wind-speed tables, they were contained in that section of the documents titled 'A52:\n\nArchitecture - General Requirements'. According to PW1, he took copies of documents which\n\ncontained technical descriptions of the ceiling as designed by architects and other\n\ntechnical explanations. In my view, section A52 clearly fell within this scope as apart\n\nfrom the wind-speed tables, it contained information relating to architectural materials,\n\nwork samples and other conditions of construction. As such, even taking PW1's case at its\n\nbest, and assuming that he had not perused through every single page of the documents, he\n\nmust at least have looked first at the main contents page. From there, he would have\n\nsieved out the relevant sections and directed for copies to be taken of those sections\n\nwhich appeared from their title to be germane to a manufacturer. Alternatively, he would\n\nhave determined the relevancy of each section by flipping to the respective cover pages\n\nand looking at the titles printed on them. Since the subject-matter \"general\n\nrequirements of architecture\" was clearly relevant to a manufacturer, I had no doubt\n\nthat PW1 must have directed for this entire section, inclusive of the wind-speed tables,\n\nto be photocopied. On a balance of probability, I found that the plaintiffs did in fact\n\ntake copies of all the relevant sections contained inExhibit D6, including Section\n\nA52. I accepted DW1's evidence that upon handing over the file to PW1, the latter left the\n\nroom with the file for a few minutes and thereafter returned without it. The file was only\n\nhanded back to DW1 some two or three hours later. The obvious inference from this was that\n\nPW1 had simply passed the file on to one of his employees with instructions to take copies\n\nof sections which were relevant. It was unlikely that in the short time that PW1 was away,\n\nhe could have given any detailed instruction to anyone about specific pages within each\n\nsection to make copies of. In any case, that the plaintiffs were in possession of all the\n\ncontract documents was corroborated by PW1 himself, who admitted without qualification in\n\nhis affidavit of evidence-in-chief that the defendants had indeed given a full set of the\n\ncontract documents to him. He further admitted perusing through these documents personally\n\nand that he was familiar with the responsibilities of the defendants under the nominated\n\nsub-contract. In the circumstances, it was incontrovertible that the plaintiffs were aware\n\nof the requirements and specifications of the KLIA Project, and must be taken to have\n\nagreed to design a ceiling system which met those requirements. To my mind, the parties\n\nmust have intended it to be a term in their contract, for why else would the defendants\n\nhave contracted with the plaintiffs to design the ceiling system if they were not going to\n\nadhere to the specifications stipulated for the KLIA Project?71 Counsel for the plaintiffs further sought to take issue with the\n\nfact that the defendants did not specifically highlight the wind speed requirement in the\n\nKLIA Project to the plaintiffs. In my view, there is no requirement in law for the\n\ndefendants to specially bring this to the plaintiffs' attention. There was no doubt that\n\nthe contract documents were replete with references to wind velocity. It was stated\n\nthroughout that the metal ceiling system had to withstand a maximum wind speed of 35.5m/s.\n\nHaving obtained and perused the contract documents, the plaintiffs must be taken to have\n\nbeen aware of this requirement and it must have been apparent to them that this was an\n\nessential term of the design contract. In fact, PW1 had himself given evidence that\n\nwind-loading was a specific design criteria for the plaintiffs' products. Moreover, he\n\nalso agreed with the question posed by me that as the ceiling in this case was to be used\n\nexternally, his awareness of wind concerns had in fact led him to make provision for wind\n\nloading in determining the spacings between the carrier rails. In my view, there was no\n\ndoubt that wind speed requirement was a relevant factor which must be taken into account\n\nby the party in charge of designing the ceiling system. In any event, even if the specific\n\nrequirement of 35.5m/s was somehow construed as not being part of the design contract, I\n\nthink it would at least be possible, or perhaps even necessary, to imply a term to the\n\neffect that the plaintiffs would design a metal ceiling system which was capable of\n\nwithstanding normal design wind speeds, given that the ceiling was intended for use\n\nexternally. In my view, such a term ought to be implied whether because it is necessary to\n\ngive business efficacy to the contract for design, or whether because an officious\n\nbystander would deem it as being such an obvious thing to do. I also accepted DW2's expert\n\nevidence that it was common industry practice for the party designing an external\n\nsuspended ceiling to take account of prevailing wind pressures in the locality. Therefore,\n\nat the very least, it must have been a term of the contract that the plaintiffs were\n\nrequired to design a ceiling which was capable of withstanding the design wind speed\n\nnormally adopted for use by Civil Engineers in Malaysia, which, in DW2's expert opinion,\n\nwas 30m/s.(3) Was there a breach of the contract for design?72 Neither party disputed the fact that several strip ceilings\n\ndislodged from the carrier rails on at least two or three occasions after they were\n\ninstalled at the KLIA. The obvious inference from this was that there must have been\n\nsomething wrong with the design of the system. I do not think there was ever any\n\nsuggestion or proof that the installation of the ceiling was faulty. In any event, having\n\nexaminedExhibits D1, D2 and D3myself, I had no doubt that it is extremely\n\ndifficult, perhaps even impossible, given the design of the carrier rails with its clip-in\n\nfunction, for the strip ceilings to slip out as a result of inadequate installation. It\n\nwas a simple, albeit extremely tedious, process of clipping the ceiling strips onto the\n\nclip-ins in such a way that it would either automatically snap snugly into position or not\n\nfasten at all. It was unlikely that the strips could have been attached only half-way onto\n\nthe clip-ins without fully clipping in. If any part of the length of the strip is not\n\nclipped in yet, it would be very obvious to the person installing it because that part\n\nwould protrude downwards and be out of alignment with the rest of the strips, a matter\n\nwhich could easily be detected with the naked eye.73 I was fortified in the view that there was a defect in the design\n\nsupplied by the plaintiffs by the fact that the problem of the strips dislodging did not\n\nrecur after several specifically design-related remedial measures were adopted by the\n\ndefendants after the incidents as explained by DW1. Firstly, the distance between the\n\ncarrier rails was reduced from 1.2m to 0.6m, and second, security clips were affixed along\n\nvarious lengths of the ceiling strips and capping profiles. It was significant that there\n\nwere no more incidents of strips falling off after these measures were implemented. In my\n\nview, the obvious inference from this was that there must have been something wrong with\n\nthe initial design supplied by the plaintiffs. Apart from the above, two further steps\n\nwere also taken by the defendants after the incidents. First, 'borders' were added to\n\nprevent wind from entering the hollow cavities in the ceiling, and second, screws were\n\nadded to secure the short intermediate joining pieces to the main ceiling strips. In my\n\nview, it was entirely reasonable for the defendants to adopt the remedial measures they\n\ndid to overcome what I considered to be a dangerous defect. Strip ceilings falling from\n\nsuch heights could kill. In an airport where human and vehicular traffic is going to be\n\nvery heavy, such a dangerous defect is clearly unacceptable.74 At this juncture, I should add that in reaching the above\n\nconclusion, I attached no weight whatsoever to DW2's analysis of the adequacy of the\n\nceiling system design as well as his postulations on the possible reasons for the\n\ndislodgement of the strips as documented in the 18 October 1999 report exhibited to his\n\naffidavit. I recognised and accepted counsel for the plaintiffs' point that the section of\n\nthe report dealing with the adequacy of the system design was based mainly on the\n\nShillinglaw test reports in respect of the wind-loading and wind-tunnel tests conducted in\n\nHong Kong on 12, 13, 30 and 31 December 1997. As the makers of the Shillinglaw reports\n\nwere not called, there was no doubt that the Shillinglaw reports relating to these later\n\ntests were classic hearsay and hence clearly inadmissible. In my view, none of the\n\nexceptions to the hearsay rule as set out in the Evidence Act (Cap. 97) were applicable on\n\nthe facts. The law on the interrelationship between hearsay and opinion evidence is clear.\n\nWhere an expert seeks to give an opinion the basis of which is dependant upon the truth of\n\nhearsay evidence, that expert's evidence is likewise inadmissible. Put another way, an\n\nexpert is only permitted to give his opinion when the primary facts upon which that\n\nopinion is based are capable of being proved by admissible evidence: Colin Tapper,Cross\n\n& Tapper on Evidence(9thEd, 1999) at pp 514-515. Where the material\n\nupon which his opinion is based have merely been reported to him by hearsay, then that\n\nexpert's opinion is inadmissible. Returning to the facts of the present case, it was not\n\nin doubt that the Shillinglaw reports were not admissible by reason of them being hearsay.\n\nIn the premises, I found those parts of DW2's opinion i.e., Sections 4.0-6.0 of the 18\n\nOctober 1999 report, which relied for its basis on the truth or accuracy of the\n\nShillinglaw reports, to be similarly inadmissible and excluded them completely. I\n\nrecognise that most experts frequently employ hearsay to some degree in forming their\n\nviews. In fact, as a matter of convenience, courts have sometimes tended not to insist\n\nupon proof of the extrinsic materials customarily employed by experts to perform their\n\nwork, namely understanding obtained from the use of professional libraries and knowledge\n\nacquired in the discharge of professional duties. Nevertheless, I did not think that the\n\nShillinglaw reports fell within that category of so-called common professional knowledge\n\nwhich an expert is entitled to rely on when he has had no personal knowledge of how that\n\nknowledge was arrived at. In my view, the reports were merely the results of specific\n\ntests conducted for a specific purpose. As such, I found that it was unsafe for me to rely\n\non the opinion given on those reports. Hearsay evidence as the basis of expert opinion\n\nmade it impossible for the court to evaluate that opinion and had the effect of turning\n\nDW2 into a conduit for the makers of the Shillinglaw reports who could not be\n\ncross-examined to test the substance of their evidence.75 I should also state at this point that I did not give a ruling on\n\nthe admissibility of DW2's opinion and/or the Shillinglaw reports during the course of the\n\ntrial because counsel for the defendants had, before the commencement of the trial,\n\nindicated in chambers that his clients would be calling one of the makers of the\n\nShillinglaw reports to testify. As such, I allowed the parties to proceed without making a\n\nruling on admissibility. At the end of the trial however, counsel for the defendants\n\ninformed me that no one from J A Shillinglaw & Associates would be called. In the\n\nresult, I directed myself that the Shillinglaw reports relating to the later tests as well\n\nas those parts of DW2's opinion that were based upon the truth of those reports would be\n\nexcluded from my final determination.76 Having done this, I found that the inference was nevertheless clear\n\nfrom the facts proved before me that there must have been something wrong with the design\n\nof the ceiling system as supplied by the plaintiffs. I described at the start of this\n\njudgment that the ceiling in question comprised two main parts, namely the upper,\n\nsuspended section, which consisted of the hangers, purlins and primary angles, and the\n\nlower section directly beneath it consisting of the carrier rails, capping profiles and\n\nceiling strips. It was not disputed that the plaintiffs supplied all the three components\n\nused in the lower section of the ceiling. It was also not disputed that during the\n\nincidents, only the ceiling strips fell. All the carrier rails and everything else above\n\nit i.e., the entire upper section, remained intact. From this, I was able to infer that\n\nthe design of the lower section of the ceiling must have been flawed. Throughout the\n\ntrial, counsel for the plaintiffs constantly tried to pin blame on the local suppliers\n\nfrom whom the defendants had purchased the materials for the upper section of the ceiling.\n\nIn my view, this was completely unwarranted and missed the obvious point that nothing in\n\nthe upper section of the ceiling fell. In fact, even the carrier rails, which were\n\nattached to the vertical hangers via the primary angles did not fall. At all times, it was\n\nonly the ceiling strips (Exhibit D1) which fell. As such, I think it was grossly\n\nunfair for the plaintiffs to make unsubstantiated allegations impugning the integrity of\n\nthe materials obtained locally or in attacking the adequacy of the installation process.77 To my mind, it was clear that the plaintiffs had failed to discharge\n\ntheir obligation under the contract to design a ceiling intended for external use which\n\nwas capable of withstanding the normal environmental conditions at the KLIA, and in\n\nparticular one which was capable of withstanding the stipulated design wind speed of\n\n35.5m/s. I think it is a matter of common inference that wind travelling at 35.5m/s is of\n\nsomewhat significant strength. That 35.5m/s was stated as the maximum velocity required\n\nfor the external ceiling at the KLIA further indicated that wind of that speed must be one\n\nof substantial force, bearing in mind that 35.5m/s was the statedmaximummeaning\n\nthat a not insignificant margin from the norm must have been taken into account by the\n\nairport authorities in reaching this design requirement. Hence, as it was not suggested\n\nthat the KLIA was subject to hurricane winds or freak weather conditions at the time of\n\nthe incidents, I could only infer that the dislodgement of the ceiling strips occurred at\n\na time when wind speeds were significantly less than 35.5m/s (or 127.8km/h). I was\n\nsupported in this conclusion by the fact that Sepang, Malaysia is not known for\n\nextraordinary climate or atmospheric changes nor was any such change reported around the\n\ntime of the incidents. In the premises, the only logical inference must be that the strips\n\nhad collapsed under normal circumstances, in which case the plaintiffs had clearly\n\nbreached their obligation to design a ceiling system which was at the very least, capable\n\nof withstanding normal environmental conditions.(4) Claim under the Sale of Goods Act (Cap. 393)78 Even if I was wrong in holding that there was a contract for design\n\nin the circumstances when there was in fact only a contract for sale, I found nevertheless\n\nthat the situation here fell squarely within the ambit of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap. 393)\n\n(\"the SGA\").79 The current version of the SGA was amended in 1996 via the Sale of\n\nGoods (Amendment) Act 1996 (Act 43/1996) (\"the Amendment Act\"). Under s 1(2) of\n\nthe Amendment Act, the provisions in the current SGA apply only to contracts for sale\n\nwhich are made or entered into on or after 1 January 1997. Contracts made prior to this\n\ndate remain to be governed by the old 1994 Revised Edition of the SGA.80 In order to determine which version of the SGA was applicable on the\n\nfacts here, it was necessary for me to identify the period of time in which the contract\n\nof sale was entered into between the parties. It was clear that the parties did not at any\n\ntime enter into a written contract. Nevertheless, the practice of issuing purchase orders\n\nand invoices started from 11 June 1996. At the same time, it was also evident from the\n\nlist of Chronology of Events submitted by the defendants, which was not disputed by the\n\nplaintiffs, that installation of the metal ceiling system at the KLIA commenced around\n\nOctober 1996. In view of these facts, I had no doubt that the contract of sale must have\n\nbeen concluded at the very latest, by October 1996, when installation works began. That\n\nthe defendants could commence installing the ceiling was a clear indication that a\n\nsubstantial quantity of the materials had already been delivered by the plaintiffs\n\npursuant to the purchase orders issued by the defendants. As a matter of fact, I was\n\npersonally inclined to the view that the contract for sale was concluded way before\n\nOctober 1996, presumably before the first purchase order was issued on 11 June 1996. In my\n\nview, the issuance of the purchase orders and invoices and the subsequent correspondence\n\nwere merely evidence of an earlier contract reached between the parties. The purchase\n\norders, invoices and subsequent correspondence did not constitute the contract itself, but\n\nmerely evidenced an earlier contract entered into way before these documents came into\n\nexistence. To put it another way, the conduct of the parties in issuing the purchase\n\norders, invoices and other correspondence can be seen as a performance or execution of\n\ntheir duties under the earlier contract for sale. While it is not possible to pin-point an\n\nexact date on which the contract for sale was entered into, I had no doubt that it must\n\nhave been concluded sometime between the date of the letter of intent, i.e., 13 January\n\n1996 and the time of the commencement of installation on site, i.e., October 1996. In the\n\npremises, I found that it was the 1994 Edition of the SGA which applied to the present\n\ncase.81 Section 2 of the 1994 Edition of the SGA provides that a contract of\n\nsale of goods is a contract by which the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the\n\nproperty in the goods to a buyer for a money consideration, called the price. All tangible\n\nmovable property to be delivered in that state is considered as goods. The word\n\n\"goods\" is defined in s 61 to include all 'things attached to or forming part of\n\nthe land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under contract of sale'.82 It was next pertinent for me to define the exact scope of the\n\ncontract of sale between the parties in order to determine if it was a contract which fell\n\nto be governed by the SGA. To my mind, the fundamental question was really one of whether\n\nthe defendants had merely agreed to buy and the plaintiffs to sell D1, D2 and D3\n\nseparately and independently of each other, or, whether the defendants had agreed to buy\n\nand the plaintiffs to sell a standard profile metal ceiling system.83 I think it was plain from the evidence that the subject-matter of\n\nthe parties' agreement was not merely in respect of the individual components D1, D2 and\n\nD3. The real state of affairs was that the defendants had asked for, and the plaintiffs\n\ncorrespondingly agreed to supply, the entire lower section of the external ceiling system\n\nat the KLIA. In this respect, I relied on the testimony of PW1 himself, who admitted that\n\nwhat the defendants had purchased was a standard profile strip ceiling. The following\n\nextract from PW1's cross-examination was relevant:Q: The Defendants bought an\n\n  off-the-shelf ceiling system from your company?A: The Defendants bought a standard profile strip ceiling. No special\n\n  design of the profile for the Defendants. I think the profile number is CP100, bought by\n\n  Defendants.Q: That CP100 is exactly the same system that is now in the Kuala\n\n  Lumpur Airport?A: If Defendants installed what we supplied, then the answer is yes.…Q: Is D1, D2 and D3 called CP100?A: It is part of CP100. CP100 also has hangers, stiffeners, profiles\n\n  for external ceiling, plugs in the concrete. We have edge profiles, acoustic inlays. These\n\n  are about the major components. Therefore if a customer simply orders CP100, he gets all\n\n  the above items including D1, D2 and D3.Subsequently, PW1 also explained that CP100 referred to the width of\n\nthe ceiling strip. \"100\" stood for the 100mm width of each strip while\n\n\"CP\" or \"curved profile\" referred to the curved or bent edges along\n\nthe length of each strip.84 In my opinion, it was clear from the above that what the defendants\n\nhad purchased from the plaintiffs was a composite standard profile ceiling system,\n\ncomprising D1, D2 and D3, which when installed as a whole unit would together form the\n\nentire lower section of the external ceiling system at the KLIA. I accepted DW1's evidence\n\nthat before he commenced negotiations with the plaintiffs, he had no idea how to construct\n\na suspended ceiling system, nor was he aware of the components involved in such a system.\n\nI also accepted that the external ceiling system in question was not one of the usual tile\n\nor plank ceilings, nor was it a typical flat strip ceiling. Rather, it was a complex\n\nthree-dimensional hanging or suspended ceiling, something which the defendants had had no\n\nprior acquaintance with. As a result, they consulted the plaintiffs with the relevant\n\nArchitectural Drawings and informed them that they wanted a ceiling that would satisfy\n\nthose architectural requirements. I therefore had no difficulty in forming the conclusion\n\nthat the idea or recommendation to use CP100 originated from the plaintiffs. There was no\n\nquestion that CP100 was a proprietary system. As such, only the plaintiffs would have\n\nknowledge of the appropriate strip ceiling profile that would best meet the defendants'\n\nrequirements. Any suggestion that CP100 should be purchased by the defendants must thus\n\nhave emanated from the plaintiffs. I surmised that what probably happened was that the\n\nplaintiffs had produced drawings of the way to construct the entire ceiling system (i.e.,\n\nboth the upper and lower sections of the system), and having examined the drawings, the\n\ndefendants decided only to purchase the entire lower section of the system. This decision\n\nhowever did not have the effect of converting the intention to enter into a contract for\n\nthe sale of a ceiling system, (albeit it was now a contract to purchase only the lower\n\nsection of the system), into an intention for the sale merely of its individual\n\ncomponents. Counsel for the plaintiffs constantly strived to place emphasis on the fact\n\nthat the defendants had purchased the components comprising the upper section of the\n\nceiling system from Malaysian suppliers. In my mind, this was completely irrelevant as it\n\nhad nothing to do with the lower section of the system, which of itself was still a\n\ncomposite, proprietary unit as attested to by PW1 himself, and which the defendants in\n\nfact purchased from the plaintiffs. It must be remembered that CP100 referred only to the\n\nlower section on its own. The description had absolutely nothing to do with the upper\n\nsection. I was further of the view that the fact that the buyers had to personally install\n\nand assemble the constituent components into the final product also did not have the\n\neffect of altering the character of the contract of sale. The situation here can perhaps\n\nbe said to be akin to that of a person buying a typical \"do-it-yourself\" item,\n\ne.g., a bicycle. Suppose I walk into a shop, inform the owner that I want to buy a\n\nbicycle, and in consequence the owner hands me a large brown box in which are contained\n\nall the necessary components and accessories for assembling a bicycle like wheels, chains,\n\nhandle bars etc. At the same time, the box also contains instructions on how to assemble\n\nthe pieces together. In such a situation, can it be said that what the shop owner had just\n\nsold and what I had just bought were mere wheels, chains and handle bars and not a\n\nbicycle? I think the obvious answer must certainly be no.85 In the circumstances, I found that the contract for the sale of the\n\nceiling system as a composite unit fell squarely within the scope of the SGA. The entire\n\nlower section of the ceiling system came within the definition of \"goods\" in the\n\nSGA. It was clear that the components comprising the system were sold and delivered as\n\ntangible, movable property to be assembled, and this I found was sufficient to bring the\n\nceiling system within the definition of \"goods\" in the SGA. In my view, any\n\nsubsequent annexation of a chattel to land which has the effect of converting the chattel\n\ninto a fixture does not take that chattel out of the realm of the SGA.86 Under the SGA, various terms are statutorily and compulsorily\n\nimplied into all contracts for the sale of goods which fall within the ambit of the Act.\n\nIn so far as they are relevant for the purposes of this case, the material provisions of\n\nthe 1994 Edition of the SGA are as follows:Implied terms about quality or fitness14. - (1) Except as provided by this section and section 15 and\n\n  subject to any other enactment, there is no implied condition or warranty about the\n\n  quality or fitness for any particular purpose of goods supplied under a contract of sale.(2) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business, there is\n\n  an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are of merchantable\n\n  quality, except that there is no such condition -(a) as regards defects specifically drawn to the buyer's attention\n\n    before the contract is made; or(b) if the buyer examines the goods before the contract is made, as\n\n    regards defects which that examination ought to reveal.(3) Where the seller sells goods in the course of a business and the\n\n  buyer, expressly or by implication, makes known -(a) to the seller;…any particular purpose for which the goods are being bought, there is\n\n  an implied condition that the goods supplied under the contract are reasonably fit for\n\n  that purpose, whether or not that is a purpose for which such goods are commonly supplied,\n\n  except where the circumstances show that the buyer does not rely, or that it is\n\n  unreasonable for him to rely, on the skill or judgment of the seller……(6) Goods of any kind are of merchantable quality within the meaning of\n\n  subsection (2) if they are as fit for the purpose or purposes for which goods of that kind\n\n  are commonly bought as it is reasonable to expect having regard to any description applied\n\n  to them, the price (if relevant) and all the other relevant circumstances.Merchantable quality87 ss 14 (2) and 14(6) set out the requirements of merchantability. InMCST\n\nPlan No 1166 v Chubb Singapore Pte Ltd[1999] 3 SLR 540, it was held, followingCammell\n\nLaird and Co Ltd v Manganese Bronze and Brass Co Ltd[1934] AC 402 that for the\n\npurpose of determining if the goods in question were fit for the purpose or purposes for\n\nwhich goods of that kind are commonly bought, it is unnecessary to establish exclusive\n\nreliance on the seller's skill and judgment. If matters such as the choice of sufficient\n\nand necessary components and the nature and properties of the components are peculiarly\n\nwithin the skill and judgment of the seller, the seller automatically assumes the\n\nresponsibility. It has also been held that the requirement of \"merchantable\n\nquality\" is satisfied so long as the goods were fit for some, albeit not all, the\n\npurposes for which goods of that description are commonly used: seeHenry Kendall &\n\nSons v William Lillico & Sons Ltd[1969] 2 AC 31.Reasonable fitness for purpose88 s 14(3) of the SGA on the other hand sets out the terms of the\n\nimplied condition relating to fitness for purpose. In theChubbcase (supra),\n\nit was held that this provision is particularly relevant in cases where the customer pays\n\na huge amount of money for a thing to be custom-built. A breach of this implied condition\n\nenables the buyer to either rescind the contract, or claim damages for breach. I\n\nrespectfully adopt the following passage from the judgment of Selvam J in theChubbcase:In one sense fitness for purpose\n\n  may connote a general purpose such as when a car is purchased for driving on the roads.\n\n  Fitness for purpose in that sense also includes good quality, that is merchantability. If\n\n  the car is not fitted with proper brakes or if the radiator breaks down or if the sun-roof\n\n  is stuck in open position on hot days it would be unfit for the purpose for which it was\n\n  sold. Fitness for purpose may also apply to a specific purpose communicated to the seller\n\n  or supplied such as when the coast guard orders a vessel for chasing pirates. If the\n\n  engines of the vessel supplied heats up at high speed and breaks down each time the coast\n\n  guard gives chase it would be utterly unfit for the specified purpose. The suppliers\n\n  cannot escape responsibility by saying that the vessel can go at low speeds.89 The distinction between merchantability and fitness for purpose was\n\nalso alluded to in theChubbcase. Briefly, it was said that merchantability\n\ngoverns the sale of a particular thing which can be applied to a range of possible uses.\n\nFitness for purpose on the other hand governs the sale of a particular thing for a\n\nparticular purpose, with the word \"particular\" understood to mean\n\n\"given\", \"disclosed\" or \"ascertained\". The common feature\n\nbetween the two however is that liability for both is strict. In other words, a seller may\n\nbe liable for a breach of either implied condition even though he had exercised all\n\npossible care.90 Returning to the facts of the present case, I accepted that CP100,\n\nor that whole composite section of the metal ceiling system which the defendants purchased\n\nfrom the plaintiffs might not always be purchased for use externally. One of its likely\n\npurposes could well have been for use as an internal suspended ceiling. In the absence of\n\nfurther proof, I was willing to assume that the system as supplied by the plaintiffs may\n\nhave been merchantable as an internal suspended ceiling, which is not exposed to the wind\n\nand other natural elements. Following the decisions inHenryKendall & Sons\n\nv William Lillico & Sons Ltd(supra) andAswan Engineering Establishment\n\nCo v Lupdine Ltd[1987] 1 WLR 1, the definition of \"merchantable quality\" is\n\nsatisfied so long as the goods are fit forsomeof their usual purposes. There is\n\nno need for the goods to be fit foreveryconceivable purpose for which they might\n\nbe used. As such, I found that the defendants' claim for breach of the implied condition\n\nof \"merchantable quality\" was not proved on a balance of probability.91 The position with regard to the implied term of \"fitness for\n\npurpose\" however is different. Here, the words \"particular purpose\" have\n\nalways been given a very broad interpretation by the courts, the reason being to broaden\n\nthe scope of remedies available to a buyer so that if for some reason s 14(2) on\n\nmerchantable quality cannot be invoked, then he would still at least have a second-string\n\nargument under s 14(3). Hence, both inKendall v Lillico(supra) andAshington\n\nPiggeries Ltd & anor v Christopher Hill Ltd[1972] AC 441, it was held that\n\nalthough the goods may be quite satisfactory for a wide range of uses, the seller will be\n\nliable if the goods are in fact unsuitable for anyone of those uses to which the buyer\n\nputs the goods.92 The key issue with regard to s 14(3) is really that of reliance:\n\nthere must have been something said or done to bring home to the seller the fact that he\n\nwas being relied upon to supply goods fit for the buyer's particular purpose. The court is\n\naided in its determination of the question of reliance by the laying down of a presumption\n\nin the section that once a particular purpose has been made known to the seller, it is\n\nassumed that the buyer will have relied on the seller to provide goods fit for that\n\npurpose. Hence, the only onus on the buyer in the first instance is to show that he has\n\nmade known the purpose for which the goods are being bought.93 Reverting to the facts of the present case, I had no doubt that the\n\ndefendants made it known to the plaintiffs right at the outset that they intended to\n\npurchase a ceiling system which was intended for use externally. This can be seen from the\n\nfact that the architectural drawings of the KLIA, the tender documents, and the\n\nspecifications contained in the nominated-subcontract were all handed over to PW1 at an\n\nearly stage of the negotiations. Moreover, representatives from the plaintiffs had also\n\nattended site meetings at the KLIA itself, in consequence of which they must have known of\n\nand personally seen the exact locations in which the ceiling system was going to be\n\ninstalled. In any case, I did not think that even the plaintiffs themselves ever\n\nquarrelled with the fact that they knew that the ceiling system was being purchased for\n\nuse exteriorly.94 I also found that the presumption of reliance was not rebutted by\n\nthe plaintiffs in this case. As before, I accepted DW1's evidence that prior to being\n\nawarded the KLIA Project, the defendants had had no experience whatsoever with the\n\nspecialised type of three-dimensional suspended ceiling in question. Throughout the\n\nworking relationship of the parties, the defendants had constantly relied on the\n\nplaintiffs for suggestions and instructions on the mechanics of installation, the\n\nsuitability of the type of material to be used, and more importantly, to propose a system\n\nwhich complied with the requirements of the KLIA Project. Moreover, it was also not in\n\ndoubt that the Gema group was well-known not only in Asia but throughout Europe for their\n\nexpertise and vast experience in metal ceiling systems. PW1 himself admitted in court that\n\nthe plaintiffs had previously supplied ceiling systems for various major projects in\n\nSingapore, including Changi Airport, UIC Building and Suntec City. Further evidence of\n\nreliance can also be gleaned from the fact that CP100 was a proprietary system, and that\n\nthe plaintiffs had continuously refused to divulge critical technical information which\n\nmight have allowed the defendants to run tests on the system to check if it was compliant.\n\nIn the result, I had no hesitation in finding that absolute reliance was placed by the\n\ndefendants in the plaintiffs to supply a ceiling system which was reasonably fit for the\n\npurpose of being used as an external suspended ceiling.95 With respect to the question whether or not there was a breach of\n\nthe implied condition of fitness for purpose, the above findings under sub-heading (3) on\n\nwhether there was a breach of the contract for design were similarly applicable here. For\n\nthe sake of brevity, I shall do no more than to repeat only the more pertinent points\n\nhere. The ceiling system supplied and installed at the KLIA was clearly deficient in that\n\nthere were at least two or three separate occasions on which the ceiling strips dislodged\n\nfrom the carrier rails and fell, all of which occurred in normal and ordinary weather. The\n\nnecessary implication from this must be that there was something wrong with the system\n\nsupplied. This dangerous \"defect\" however was remedied once the security clips\n\nwere affixed to the strips and the capping profiles, and the distance between the carrier\n\nrails halved. I think all this was sufficient to show that the initial composite system as\n\nsupplied by the plaintiffs was defective. The ceiling system when used internally might\n\nnot have caused any problems. But that is not the purpose for which the defendants had\n\npurchased it. The fact that certain modifications made to the original set-up or design of\n\nthe thing in question (e.g., halving the carrier spacing), or fixing additional components\n\n(e.g., security clips) could render the thing fit for its purpose is irrelevant to a\n\nfinding that the thing was in the first place, not reasonably fit for its purpose.\n\nReturning to the example I gave earlier of a non-ready-assembled bicycle. Suppose I\n\nassemble the bicycle utilising all the parts or components supplied with the package and\n\nin accordance with the instructions given. After riding around for a while, the chain\n\nsnaps or loosens and I am unable to continue riding the bicycle as this problem keeps on\n\nrecurring. It turns out that the reason for the chain coming loose was because the\n\nmanufacturers of the bicycle failed to include say a special fastener necessary to hold\n\nthe chain in place. In this situation, can it be denied that the manufacturers or sellers\n\nof the bicycle had breached their duty to supply me with a bicycle which was reasonably\n\nfit for its purpose? Applying the analogy of the bicycle to the facts of the present case,\n\nI had no doubt that the plaintiffs had breached the implied condition under s 14(3) of the\n\nSale of Goods Act. At this juncture, I should perhaps set out the facts of theChubbcase (supra), as they are somewhat similar to the facts here. Briefly, what\n\nhappened in that case was that the defendants, Chubb, supplied and installed a videophone\n\nsecurity system for the Mandarin Gardens condominium. Part of the system comprised an\n\naudio-video communication system which was located at the condominium's two main road\n\nentrances. Subsequently, the system became plagued by various problems. Of these, one of\n\nthe more significant was its tendency to become crippled whenever there was lightning\n\nactivity in the vicinity. Selvam J had no difficulty in reaching the conclusion that the\n\ndefendants had breached their obligation under s 14(3) of the SGA. In his view, Chubb\n\nshould have fitted the system with surge arresters and co-axial cables. It was\n\nunreasonable and preposterous to expect the plaintiffs, their predecessors or their\n\nconsultants to detect these faults and build in rectification measures. It was Chubb's\n\ncontractual duty to come up with a system in accordance with the specifications provided\n\nto them.96 I should add that even if the contract for sale in the present case\n\nwas deemed to have been concluded after 1 January 1997 such that it is the current edition\n\nof the SGA which applied to the facts here, the position would still be the same as s\n\n14(3) was left unchanged by the Amendment Act.97 Finally, with respect to counsel for the plaintiffs' attempt to rely\n\non the Durability Warranty Form issued by the plaintiffs to the defendants. In my view,\n\nthis Form was of no avail to the plaintiffs as their breach of s 14(3) fell outside the\n\nlimited scope of the Warranty, which was concerned mainly with the durability of the\n\nindividual components themselves, rather than the functionality of the composite system.\n\nIn any case, I found that the words of the Warranty did not have the effect of excluding\n\nliability. They merely offered a so-called guarantee period in which the products supplied\n\nwere guaranteed to be free from certain defects, much like the Defects Liability Period\n\ncommonly used in contracts for the sale of real property. The effect of such\n\n\"warranties\" is really to reduce the possibility of litigation in the event that\n\ndefects occur within the stated period. In such a case, the \"warrantor\", having\n\ngiven the warranty, would generally remedy the defects or replace the defective goods as a\n\nmatter of course. If there is a dispute, the buyer can simply rely on that warranty or\n\nguarantee to establish his cause of action. After the period however, should the buyer\n\nwish to claim against the seller, then the buyer must establish a valid cause of action in\n\nlaw. But in no way do such \"warranties\" cause a buyer to lose or relinquish his\n\nright to sue the seller for defects in the goods after the period of the guarantee has\n\npassed.98 Having considered all the circumstances of this case, I allowed the\n\ndefendants' claim for breach of the contract to design a proper metal ceiling system\n\nand/or breach of s 14(3) of the Sale of Goods Act. I further directed that interlocutory\n\njudgment be entered and for damages to be assessed. In the result, I dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs' claim for S$143,250 in respect of the security clips supplied by them to the\n\ndefendants after the collapse of the ceiling strips as this cost was incurred as a result\n\nof the plaintiffs' breach of contract in the first place. The claim for RM225.20 in\n\nrespect of Invoice No. 602526 was also dismissed in light of PW1's agreement to give the\n\ndefendants a credit note for it. I allowed however the plaintiffs' claim for RM208,636.79\n\narising from unpaid invoices issued in respect of materials supplied before the incidents\n\nat the KLIA.99 I should also add at this point that I did not think it was\n\nnecessary for me to deal with the defendants' claim in negligence in the light of my\n\nfindings with respect to their claim in contract. In any event, where the parties were\n\nclearly involved in a contractual and commercial relationship, there is nothing to the\n\nadvantage of the law's development to search for liability in tort: per Lord Scarman inTai\n\nHing Cotton Mill Ltd v Liu Chong Hing Bank[1986] AC 8o at p 107. Indeed the\n\nconsequences flowing from either cause of action are different and are liable to be\n\nconfused, as can be seen from the plaintiffs' misguided argument that no remedy lies in\n\nrespect of pure economic loss. I think the law is clear that this statement holds true\n\nonly in respect of negligence claims, while contractual ones are governed solely by the\n\nprinciples of remoteness of damage as laid down inHadley v Baxendale(1894) 9 Exch\n\n341.(5) Plaintiffs' claim for RM21,251 in respect of Invoice No. 97568100 This was the claim for certain airfreight charges which the\n\nplaintiffs alleged they did not agree to bear. In the absence of any evidence from the\n\ndefendants to refute this allegation, I allowed the plaintiffs this head of claim.(6) Plaintiffs' claim for RM2,830.46 in respect of Invoice No. 97693101 This was the claim for the supply of certain tiles to the\n\ndefendants. The defendants' defence was that they were not obliged to pay under this\n\ninvoice as the wrong tiles were sent. When asked if this was true, PW1 replied that he had\n\nno idea. As a result, I found that the plaintiffs had not established this head of claim\n\non a balance of probability and I consequently dismissed it. I found that the standard\n\nwords printed on the plaintiffs' standard form invoice as referred to in  23 of this\n\njudgment did not avail the plaintiffs as no evidence was adduced that the defendants had\n\nindeed acknowledged receipt of the tiles.(7) Defendants' claim for late delivery of capping profiles102 In light of PW1's concession that the delay was indeed due to a\n\nproduction mistake in the factory, I allowed the defendants this head of claim.(8) Defendants' claim for late delivery of documents103 This claim can easily be dealt with. The law on CIF contracts is\n\nclear. The seller, having procured the necessary documents, must make every reasonable\n\neffort to send the documents forward as soon as possible after he has destined the goods\n\nshipped to the buyer, but without reference to the arrival or unloading of the cargo.\n\nThere is no implied condition in a CIF contract that the seller should deliver the\n\ndocuments to the buyer in sufficient time to enable the buyer to send on the bill of\n\nlading to meet the arrival of the ship, or in time to reach the place of discharge before\n\ncharges on the goods are incurred there: Sassoon,CIF & FOB Contracts(4thEd, 1995) at pp 195-197. InSanders v Maclean(1883) 11 QBD 327, Brett MR stated\n\nthe position as such:It is… equally impossible, to\n\n  my mind, to say that even a stipulation ought to be implied in the contract that the bill\n\n  of lading should be delivered so that it may arrive before or at the time of the arrival\n\n  of the ship or before charges are incurred.104 On the evidence before me, I found that the plaintiffs had\n\nadequately explained the processes and inherent difficulties involved in obtaining some of\n\nthe necessary documents, particularly where third party institutions were involved. They\n\nhad exerted all reasonable efforts to procure the documents as soon as was practicable in\n\nthe circumstances and I was satisfied that this was a sufficient discharge of their\n\nobligations under a CIF contract. As such, I ruled against the defendants in respect of\n\nthis claim.105 The remainder of the defendants' counterclaim which was not alluded\n\nto in this judgment was also dismissed. At the same time, I ordered that judgment for the\n\nplaintiffs on both the claim for the original supply of materials and for the airfreight\n\ncharges be stayed pending the assessment of damages.Costs106 This entire litigation started out with each side advancing many\n\ndifferent heads of claim. In the end however, I found for the defendants on the main issue\n\nof liability although a number of the plaintiffs' smaller heads of claims were also\n\nallowed. Nevertheless, I think it was clear that the defendants were the eventual victors\n\nin this case, as a result of which I ordered the plaintiffs to pay the defendants' costs\n\nto be taxed less S$12,000 in recognition of the former's success in the RM21,251 claim for\n\nairfreight. I did not attach any weight to the fact of their success in the claim for the\n\noriginal supply of materials as this was not in any event disputed by the defendants and\n\nwould effectively be set-off against the defendants' counterclaim at the assessment stage\n\nanyway.CHAN SENG ONNJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
