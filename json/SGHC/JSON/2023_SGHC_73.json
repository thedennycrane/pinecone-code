        "Introduction": "1 The roots of this dispute run deep – like the proverbial pebble in the pond that leaves far-reaching ripples in its wake, the plaintiff’s attempts to enforce judgments obtained in previous lawsuits against one Dr Goh Seng Heng (“Dr Goh”) have culminated in the present proceedings against the defendants, who are his wife and two of his children. 2 In this suit, the plaintiff claims that Dr Goh has fraudulently disposed of his assets by transferring them to or purchasing them in the names of the defendants.",
        "Background": "",
        "Dramatis personae": "3 The plaintiff, Wang Xiaopu (“Mdm Wang”), is a Chinese national and Singapore Permanent Resident. She is in the business of manufacturing, marketing and retailing facial and skincare products in the People’s Republic of China.1Foot Note 1×Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 3) (“SOC”) at para 1. 4 The defendants are family members of Dr Goh. For clarity, Dr Goh is not a party to the present proceedings.

        "Business dealings between Mdm Wang and Dr Goh": "6 Mdm Wang was introduced to Dr Goh in October 2013 through Lin Pei-Li (“Ms Lin”), who was Mdm Wang’s bank relationship manager and also a shareholder of AMP. On 15 October 2013, a meeting took place on Dr Goh’s yacht between Mdm Wang, her husband (“Mr Sun”), Dr Goh, Ms Lin and Mr Lee Kin Yun (“Mr Lee”). Mr Lee was an employee of a subsidiary of AMP and a shareholder in AMP. He is a close associate and friend of Dr Goh.4Foot Note 4×Wang Xiaopu’s 11th affidavit for SUM 3092/2021 dated 5 July 2021 at para 97; Transcript of 8 September 2021 at p 56 ln 18 to ln 23.Mdm Wang entered a Memorandum of Understanding (the “1st MOU”) whereby she agreed to purchase 20,000 shares in AMP for the price of S$500 per share. The details of this transaction are set out inWangXiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another[2019] SGHC 284 (“WXP2019”) at [8] to [11], [62]. 7 In 2014, Mdm Wang and Mr Sun agreed to buy out a group of minority shareholders in AMP (the “angel investors”) from Dr Goh at the price of S$450 per share (at [18]). Mdm Wang entered a second Memorandum of Understanding (the “2nd MOU”) on or around 25 September 2014, which provided that she was to purchase 50,000 shares from Dr Goh (at [21]). The shares were to be transferred and paid for in three tranches. Only the transfer and purchase of the first two tranches were completed (at [22]).",
        "Related lawsuits": "Suit No 686/2015 (“Suit 686”) against Dr Goh and Dr Michelle 8 Mdm Wang commenced Suit 686 against Dr Goh and another daughter of his, Dr Michelle Goh (“Dr Michelle”) on 6 July 2015.5Foot Note 5×See Writ of Summons for S 686/2015 filed 6 July 2015.With respect to the 1st MOU, she claimed that Dr Goh had made three misrepresentations which induced her to enter the 1st MOU, namely that: (a) He had previously sold AMP’s shares at S$600 to S$700 per share to other doctors and minority shareholders and was willing to sell her the 20,000 shares at a discount price of S$500 per share. (b) He would not sell his shares in AMP to any other third party before AMP’s initial public offering (“IPO”) without Mdm Wang’s consent. (c) AMP had made pre-tax profits of S$10m in the financial year of 2013, and AMP’s pre-tax profit was growing at a rate of more than 30% a year (WXP2019at [25]–[27]). 9 In the alternative, Mdm Wang claimed that Dr Goh had breached his contractual obligations under the 1st MOU (WXP 2019at [30]–[32]). 10 With respect to the 2nd MOU, Mdm Wang claimed that Dr Goh and Dr Michelle had made three misrepresentations which induced her to enter the 2nd MOU (WXP2019at [35]): (a) An erroneous figure for AMP’s pre-tax-profit and compensation calculation for the shortfall in pre-tax profit under the 1st MOU was conveyed to Mdm Wang. (b) Dr Goh represented that the angel investors were only willing to sell their shares at S$450 per share when they were content to sell at S$350 per share. (c) Dr Goh impliedly represented that he would continue not to sell any of his shares in AMP without Mdm Wang’s permission. 11 In the alternative, Mdm Wang submitted that Dr Goh had, in the course of the implementation of the 2nd MOU, offered to transfer 22,000 of his shares in AMP to Mdm Wang (to prevent delay in Mdm Wang receiving her second tranche of shares), before acquiring the same number of shares from the angel investors, but had no intention of buying back the 22,000 shares from the angel investors due to AMP’s precarious financial situation (WXP2019at [36]). Alternatively, Mdm Wang claimed for a breach of contract in respect of the 2nd MOU (at [37]–[39]). 12 Dr Goh counterclaimed against Mdm Wang for repudiatory breach of the 1st MOU (as amended), and both defendants counterclaimed against Mdm Wang for repudiatory breach of the 2nd MOU. Mdm Wang had purported to avoid and rescind both agreements based on Dr Goh’s misrepresentations, and the defendants’ position was that she was in repudiatory breach of both agreements as her claims of misrepresentation were not valid (WXP2019at [50]). 13 For the 1st MOU, Mdm Wang succeeded in her claims for misrepresentation in respect of the discounted share price representation and the no further sales representation, but not the AMP business growth representation (WXP 2019at [109], [134] and [165]). As for the 2nd MOU, Mdm Wang succeeded in her claim for misrepresentation in respect of the August 2014 EBITDA representation and the AI share price representation, but not the second no further sale of shares representation (WXP 2019at [218], [237] and [244]). Accordingly, on 5 December 2019, the court granted the following reliefs (WXP2019at [265]): (a) A declaration that the 1st MOU (as amended) and the 2nd MOU have been validly rescinded by Wang. (b) [Dr] Goh is to repay the sales proceeds of S$30,700,000 from the sale of 66,000 shares in AMP to [Mdm] Wang in exchange for the re-transfer of those shares, with interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum from the dates on which the payments were made as set out in ... [Dr] Goh is to bear any duty or charge associated with the re-transfer of those shares. (c) In the event that [Dr] Goh does not repay the sales proceeds of S$30,700,000 from the sale of 66,000 shares in AMP to [Mdm] Wang within 30 days from the date of this decision, [Dr] Goh is to account for the sales proceeds and a consequential tracing order for those proceeds is granted. For the avoidance of doubt, the time to repay may be extended by agreement between [Dr] Goh and [Mdm] Wang or by order of court. (d) [Dr] Goh is to repay the stamp duty and bank charges with interest at a rate of 5.33% per annum from the dates on which the payments were made as set out … Suit No 1311/2015 (“Suit 1311”) against Dr Goh and Dr Michelle 14 Suit 1311 was commenced by Liberty Sky Investments Limited (“Liberty Sky”) against Dr Goh and Dr Michelle on 31 December 2015.6Foot Note 6×See Writ of Summons for Suit 1311 filed 31 December 2015.(Liberty Sky InvestmentsLtd v Goh Seng Heng and another[2020] 3 SLR 335 (“LibertySky 1311”) at [2]). Liberty Sky was a company incorporated in the Seychelles. 15 Liberty Sky alleged that Dr Goh and Dr Michelle had made fraudulent misrepresentations to its representatives Ms Florence Gong and Mr Andy Lin, which induced Liberty Sky to enter into a sale and purchase agreement to buy shares in AMP from Dr Goh (“the Sale and Purchase Agreement”) (LibertySky 1311at [1]). In essence, the representations were to the effect that there would be an imminent trade sale of all AMP shares to an important person in Singapore, that Dr Goh intended to list AMP through an initial public offering on the Singapore Exchange if the trade sale did not materialise, and that Dr Goh required Liberty Sky’s financial support to buy out minority investors in AMP with voting rights who could stifle the trade sale or the initial public offering (at [4]). Dr Goh counterclaimed for nominal damages for wrongful repudiation of the Sale and Purchase Agreement (at [117]). 16 At the end of the trial, Liberty Sky stated that it would not pursue its claim against Dr Michelle (LibertySky 1311at [29]); in any event, the court found that Liberty Sky had failed to prove its case against Dr Michelle (at [34]). The court found that Liberty Sky had proved its case against Dr Goh on fraudulent misrepresentation with respect to the representations that a trade sale was imminent and likely and that AMP was working towards an initial public offering, and that Dr Goh would also have been liable under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (at [96]). Since Dr Goh had been found liable for fraudulent misrepresentation, his counterclaim was dismissed (at [117]). Suit No 457 of 2017 (“Suit 457”) against Dr Goh and AMP 17 Liberty Sky also claimed it had entered into an indemnity agreement with AMP whereby AMP would indemnify Liberty Sky for the sale price of the shares plus 15% annualised internal rate of return should AMP not achieve a trade sale or public listing within 24 months of the Sale and Purchase Agreement being executed. As the trade sale and initial public offering did not occur, Liberty Sky filed Suit 457 against Dr Goh and AMP to claim against AMPvis-à-visthis indemnity agreement (Liberty Sky Investments Ltd v Goh Seng Heng andanother[2019] SGHC 40 at [2]). The court found that there was no separate and independent indemnity agreement (at [48]–[49], [62] and [68]–[69]). Appeals against decisions in Suit 1311 and Suit 457 18 In CA/Civil Appeal No 57 of 2019, Dr Goh appealed unsuccessfully against the court’s finding on liability for misrepresentation in Suit 1311 (Liberty Sky Investments v Aesthetic Medical Partners Pte Ltd and other appeals and anothermatter[2020] 1 SLR 606 (“Liberty Sky Appeal”)). 19 In CA/Civil Appeal No 56 of 2019, Liberty Sky appealed unsuccessfully against the court’s finding in Suit 1311 that it was entitled only to damages for 1,500 AMP shares (Liberty Sky Appealat [31]). In CA/Civil Appeal No 55 of 2019, Liberty Sky appealed against the court’s finding in Suit 457 that there was no indemnity agreement between Liberty Sky and AMP and was also unsuccessful (at [32]). Suit No 546 of 2015 (“Suit 546”) commenced by Dr Goh 20 Dr Goh, as the Managing Director and a shareholder of AMP,7Foot Note 7×SOC (Amendment No. 1) for Suit 546 at para 1.commenced Suit 546 against several shareholders in AMP and parties related to them. Mdm Wang was initially the seventh defendant to Suit 546.8Foot Note 8×SOC (Amendment No.1) for Suit 546 at paras 6–12.Dr Goh discontinued the action against Mdm Wang on 10 June 2015.9Foot Note 9×See Notice of Discontinuance for Suit 546 filed 10 June 2015. 21 Essentially, Dr Goh’s case was that the parties had entered into several agreements for Dr Goh or Dr Michelle to sign resolutions on behalf of and/or exercise voting rights in relation to shares belonging to the defendants. However, in breach of these agreements, an extraordinary general meeting was held on 9 June 2015 whereby resolutions were passed appointing one of the defendants as a director of AMP, removing Dr Goh as director and managing director of AMP and removing Dr Michelle, Ms Goh and Mdm Koh as directors of AMP.10Foot Note 10×SOC (Amendment No.1) for Suit 546 at paras 30–31. 22 In their counterclaim, the first to third defendants averred that Dr Goh was in breach of their agreements in issuing new shares to other parties without the first defendant’s consent.11Foot Note 11×Defence and Counterclaim (“DCC”) (Amendment No.1) for Suit 546 dated 24 July 2017 at paras 36–38.The fourth to sixth defendants counterclaimed for misrepresentations allegedly made by Dr Goh, for breaches of the agreement between them, and for breaches of Dr Goh’s fiduciary duties.12Foot Note 12×DCC (Amendment No.1) for Suit 546 dated 3 August 2017 at paras 44–45, 49–54. 23 Suit 546 was discontinued by Dr Goh as of 13 September 2017.13Foot Note 13×See Notice of Discontinuance for Suit 546 filed 13 September 2017. Suit No 111 of 2016 (“Suit 111”) against Dr Goh, Dr Michelle, Mdm Koh, Ms Goh, Mr Lee and Quikglow 24 Suit 111 was commenced by AMP, its subsidiary, Aesthetic Medical Holdings Pte Ltd (“AMH”), and AMH’s subsidiary, PPP Investments Pte Ltd (“PPP”), against Dr Goh, Dr Michelle, Mdm Koh, Ms Goh, Mr Lee and a clinic named Quikglow Pte Ltd which was controlled by Dr Goh’s family.14Foot Note 14×See SOC (Amendment No. 2) for Suit 111. 25 The plaintiffs to Suit 111 averred that the defendants had conspired to engage in a series of unlawful acts in breach of their contractual, fiduciary, statutory and/or common law duties, with intention to injure and/or cause loss and damage to the plaintiffs.15Foot Note 15×See SOC (Amendment No. 2) for Suit 111.Dr Goh and Dr Michelle, in turn, counterclaimed that the plaintiffs had defamed them in a notice published on or about 5 February 2016 in AMH’s outlets.16Foot Note 16×DCC (Amendment No. 2) for Suit 111 at paras 70–94. 26 The plaintiffs successfully applied for a Mareva injunction against Dr Goh and Dr Michelle (the “Suit 111 Mareva Injunction”).17Foot Note 17×SUM 754/2016 filed 18 February 2016; see ORC 1614/2016.On 3 May 2016, the Mareva injunction was discharged after the defendants put up security to satisfy the plaintiffs.18Foot Note 18×See ORC 2816/2016. 27 Suit 111 was discontinued by the plaintiffs on 12 September 2017.19Foot Note 19×See Notice of Discontinuance for Suit 111 dated 12 September 2017.",
        "Aftermath of proceedings against Dr Goh": "Bankruptcy application by Dr Goh 28 On 6 March 2020, Dr Goh applied for bankruptcy,20Foot Note 20×See Originating Summons (Debtor’s Bankruptcy Application) for B 940/2020 filed 6 March 2020.stating that he was unable to pay his debts and that the cause of his insolvency was business failure.21Foot Note 21×Goh Seng Heng’s affidavit in support of debtor’s bankruptcy application dated 6 March 2020 at paras 2–3.Dr Goh was declared a bankrupt on 19 March 2020.22Foot Note 22×See ORC 5201/2021 for B 940/2020. Committal proceedings against Dr Goh 29 Following Dr Goh’s failure to repay the proceeds of S$30.7m from the sale of AMP’s shares to Mdm Wang (as ordered in Suit 686, see above at [13]), Mdm Wang applied for an order of committal against Dr Goh on 16 November 2020.23Foot Note 23×See SUM 5041/2020 filed 16 November 2020.On 19 October 2021, I found Dr Goh to be in contempt of court for lying to the court:WangXiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another[2021] SGHC 282 at [1]. Dr Goh’s appeal against the sentence was dismissed on 27 June 2022:DrGoh Seng Heng v Wang Xiaopu[2022] 2 SLR 769 at [29]. Mdm Wang then sought costs of and incidental to the committal proceedings against both Dr Goh and Dr Michelle, who had acted as Dr Goh’s litigation sponsor in the committal proceedings. I ordered costs on an indemnity basis against Dr Goh but did not find that the circumstances of the case justified a costs order against Dr Michelle:WangXiaopu v Goh Seng Heng and another[2022] SGHC 272 at [10] and [39].",
        "Parties’ cases": "30 Mdm Wang’s case is that Dr Goh has sought to delay, hinder and/or defraud his creditors by fraudulently placing his assets beyond his creditors’ reach via various asset purchases and transfers.24Foot Note 24×SOC at paras 28 and 29.The defendants’ case is that the transactions relied on by Mdm Wang were made in good faith and without knowledge of any intention to delay, hinder and/or defraud Dr Goh’s creditors and/or to make Dr Goh judgment-proof.25Foot Note 25×Defence at paras 23–25.",
        "Properties transferred to or purchased in the names of the defendants": "31 Mdm Wang avers that Dr Goh had sought to place his assets beyond his creditors’ reach by transferring the following properties to Dr Goh’s family members:26Foot Note 26×SOC at paras 28 and 29. (a) On 12 April 2019, Dr Goh transferred his joint tenancy interest in his matrimonial home (“36 Cove Way”) to Mdm Koh for the sum of S$5,250,000.27Foot Note 27×SOC at paras 31–43.

(c) On 29 May 2015, Dr Goh purchased a unit in Seascape, 59 Cove Way (“Seascape”), in Dr Jeremy’s name for S$5,800,000.29Foot Note 29×SOC at paras 54–64. 32  The defendants’ position is that these transactions were made in good faith.30Foot Note 30×Defence at para 24.With respect to the sale of Dr Goh’s joint tenancy interest in 36 Cove Way to Mdm Koh for S$5,250,000, the defendants aver that Mdm Koh had engaged United Valuers Pte Ltd to value the property. The latter had opined that the open market value of 36 Cove Way was S$10,500,000 at the material time, such that the value of Dr Goh’s equal share in 36 Cove Way would be S$5,250,000 at the time of sale.31Foot Note 31×Defence at paras 34 and 35, 61.Mdm Koh had paid the consideration for 36 Cove Way from her own funds out of a bank account held by her alone.32Foot Note 32×Defence at paras 38 and 61.Mdm Koh said that she had purchased Dr Goh’s joint tenancy interest so that she did not have to make decisions jointly with Dr Goh as to whether Mdm Koh’s mother could continue residing in 36 Cove Way.33Foot Note 33×Defence at paras 38–39. 33 With respect to Berth and Seascape, the defendants aver that although the properties were purchased using monies in a bank account (“the OCBC 501 Account”) which  Dr Goh and Mdm Koh jointly held, only Mdm Koh operated the account and exercised full control over the monies in it.34Foot Note 34×Defence at paras 46, 65 and 81.The defendants aver that Ms Melissa is the full legal and beneficial owner of Berth and Dr Jeremy is the full and beneficial owner of Seascape at all material times.35Foot Note 35×Defence at paras 51 and 70.Berth and Seascape were gifted to Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy respectively as Dr Goh and Mdm Koh knew that Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy were not earning enough money to afford comfortable homes at the material time.36Foot Note 36×Defence at paras 49 and 68. 34 Further, the defendants aver that Mdm Wang is a stranger to the sale of Dr Goh’s interest in 36 Cove Way, the gift of Berth and the gift of Seascape and has no standing to assert the existence of a constructive and/or resulting trust over these properties in Dr Goh’s favour.37Foot Note 37×Defence at paras 44, 61 and 81.",
        "Monies in OCBC bank account": "35 In March 2016, Dr Goh gifted monies of approximately S$18m or more in an OCBC bank account (the “OCBC 582 Account”) to Dr Jeremy. I will refer to this sum as the “OCBC 582 Monies”. Mdm Wang avers that this gift was made by Dr Goh with the intention to hinder, delay or defraud creditors by placing them in Dr Jeremy’s name, without any consideration or good faith on Dr Jeremy’s part, and that Dr Jeremy had intentionally knowingly assisted and/or abetted Dr Goh in doing so.38Foot Note 38×SOC at paras 29 and 65–75. 36 The defendants acknowledge that the beneficial interest in the OCBC 582 Monies (of about S$18,449,687.01 as of in or around March 2016) had been jointly held by the Goh family as of March 2016.39Foot Note 39×Defence at para 87.However, after Dr Jeremy consented to Seascape being offered as security in exchange for the discharge of the Suit 111 Mareva Injunction, the full beneficial interest in the OCBC 582 Monies was given to him by other members of Dr Goh’s family.40Foot Note 40×Defence at para 92. 37 Dr Jeremy withdrew S$18,465,000 from the OCBC 582 Account via three cashier’s orders on 7 May 2016 and deposited the same sum in a HSBC bank account held in his name on 9 May 2016. On 28 May 2016, he withdrew the remaining $20,399.29 from the OCBC 582 Account and closed that account; he expended this sum on personal living expenses.41Foot Note 41×Defence at paras 109(a)–109(c).Between August and November 2016, Dr Jeremy transferred S$18,000,000 out of his HSBC account via multiple cheque deposits to accounts held in Mdm Koh and Ms Melissa’s names.42Foot Note 42×Defence at paras 109(d)–109(i).",

The two companies (collectively, “the yacht companies”) are in the business of chartering ships and boats with crew. YM was incorporated on 6 December 2013 and SYC was incorporated on 11 October 2013, and Dr Goh and Mdm Koh were founding directors of the yacht companies.43Foot Note 43×SOC at para 80. 39 On 4 October 2017, Dr Goh ceased to be a director of YM. As for SYC, Dr Goh ceased to be a director on 14 September 2017 and transferred his 90% shareholding in SYC to Mdm Koh on 18 September 2017. The remaining 10% shareholding in SYC belongs to Ms Melissa.44Foot Note 44×SOC at para 80. 40 There is no explanation as to what happened to the loans when he declared bankruptcy. Mdm Wang’s position is that these loans were either wrongfully novated by agreement to Mdm Koh or paid to Dr Goh.45Foot Note 45×SOC at paras 80 and 81.Mdm Wang avers that the novation of the two loans and disposal of shares in the yacht companies were done with the intention to hinder, delay and/or defraud Dr Goh’s creditors, without valuable and/or good consideration or good faith, and/or with Mdm Koh having notice of Dr Goh’s intent.46Foot Note 46×SOC at para 83(1). 41 The defendants aver that SYC and YM are inactive as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, and the loans novated to and owing to Mdm Koh are unlikely to be recovered.47Foot Note 47×Defence at para 117.This novation and the transfer of SYC shares to Mdm Koh were done so that Mdm Koh could assume responsibilities, rights and liabilities in the yacht companies and to correct the yacht companies’ books and records, as Mdm Koh was the true lender who had financed these loans with her monies.",
        "Further evidence of intent to delay, hinder and/or defraud creditors": "Mortgage of properties 42 Mdm Wang avers that on 22 September 2017 and 23 January 2018, respectively, Seascape and Berth were mortgaged in favour of Standard Chartered Bank (Singapore Limited), which resulted in the diminution of their remaining equity value.48Foot Note 48×SOC at paras 76–77.The defendants’ position is that Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy had, in good faith and without knowledge of any intention to hinder, delay and/or defraud Dr Goh’s creditors, acted to their prejudice by mortgaging Berth49Foot Note 49×Defence at para 63.and Seascape50Foot Note 50×Defence at para 83.respectively. Bankruptcy application 43 Mdm Wang avers that Dr Goh’s bankruptcy application was an abuse of process intended to delay, hinder and/or defraud his creditors, particularly Mdm Wang herself. Dr Goh’s declaration of having no assets in his affidavit in support of his bankruptcy application and statement of affairs should be viewed against the following facts:51Foot Note 51×SOC at paras 78–83. (a) Between September 2013 and January 2015, Dr Goh received at least S$60,122,050 from a company named RSP Investments, Mdm Wang and Liberty Sky for the purchase of AMP Shares.52Foot Note 52×SOC at para 79. (b) Dr Goh did not explain what had happened to his unsecured interest-free loans to the yacht companies, and the loans were either wrongfully novated to Mdm Koh or paid out to Dr Goh without being accounted for.53Foot Note 53×SOC at paras 81–82.

Bank accounts jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh 45 Mdm Wang also avers that between March and November 2016, Dr Goh had disposed of his interest in three bank accounts jointly owned by himself and Mdm Koh. This was either done by deleting his name as a joint account holder or transferring the beneficial interest of the monies in these accounts to Mdm Koh or other third parties.57Foot Note 57×SOC at paras 83A–83D. Family cars purchased in Mdm Koh’s name 46 Mdm Wang states that Dr Goh had stated in his statement of affairs dated 6 March 2020 that he had sold two motor vehicles. Between March 2016 and August 2018, Mdm Koh purchased three vehicles in her name for family use.

        "Legal Principles": "",
        "Section 73B of the CLPA": "70 Mdm Wang seeks to rely primarily on s 73B of the CLPA, which provides: 73B.—(1) Except as provided in this section, every conveyance of property, made whether before or after 12th November 1993, with intent to defraud creditors, shall be voidable, at the instance of any person thereby prejudiced. (2) This section does not affect the law relating to bankruptcy for the time being in force. (3) This section does not extend to any estate or interest in property disposed of for valuable consideration and in good faith or upon good consideration and in good faith to any person not having, at the time of the disposition, notice of the intent to defraud creditors. 71 To make out a cause of action under s 73B of the CLPA, the burden of proof lies on the plaintiff to establish that: (a) that there has been a conveyance of property; (b) that this conveyance was made with the intent of defrauding creditors; and (c) that the plaintiff is a person prejudiced by the foregoing conveyance of property:Wong Ser Wan v Ng Bok Holdings Pte Ltd and another[2004] 4 SLR(R) 365 (“Wong Ser Wan”) at [5]. 72 The defendant, who is generally the recipient of the property conveyed, will be able to defeat the plaintiff’s action and retain the property if he can establish that: (a) he acquired the property for valuable consideration and in good faith, or for good consideration and in good faith; and (b) he did not have notice of the debtor’s intent to defraud his creditors:Wong Ser Wanat [5]. 73 For a finding of fraudulent intent to be made out, where the transfer was made for valuable consideration, it must be shown that the transferor acted with the actual intent to defraud creditors and that the transferee had notice of the transferor’s fraudulent intention. However, where a transfer is a voluntary conveyance,ie, it had been made without any or with nominal consideration, the intention of thetransfereewas not relevant and can be inferred from the circumstances surrounding the transfer, such that it is only necessary to show that thetransferorhad an intent to defraud creditors (Wong Ser Wanat [7]–[8], followingQuah Kay Tee v Ong and Co PteLtd[1996] 3 SLR(R) 637(“Quah KayTee”)). For voluntary conveyances, constructive fraud can be raised in additional to actual fraud, and in the case of constructive fraud, the court will, under certain circumstances, presume or deem a fraudulent intent (Quah Kay Teeat [14]). 74 I briefly caveat, for the sake of precision, that the court inQuah Kay Teehad applied the Statute of 13 Elizabethan 1571 (c 5) (UK) and not s 73B of the CLPA (at [10]). That being said, the Court of Appeal in the recent case ofRothstarGroup Ltd v Leow Quek Shiong and other appeals[2022] 2 SLR 158 has made clear (at [69]–[73]) that the applicable principles in bothQuah Kay TeeandWong Ser Wanare not in dispute – specifically, with respect to the burden of proof of proving the elements in s 73B(1) of the CLPA and the establishment of fraudulent intention (as stated inWong Ser Wanat [4]–[8] andQuan Kay Teeat [14]).",
        "Resulting and constructive trusts": "75 The law on resulting trusts, premised on the equitable position that the ownership of a property by a person who has not contributed any money towards its purchase, is well settled (YeoGuan Chye Terence and another v Lau Siew Kim[2007] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [48], citingCheng YokeKuen v Cheong Kwok Kiong[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1126). Resulting trusts are presumed to arise in two circumstances (Lau Siew Kim v Yeo GuanChye Terence and another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 108(“Lau SiewKim”) at [34]): (a) Firstly, where A makes a voluntary payment to B or pays (in whole or in part) for the purchase of property vested either in B’s name or in their joint names, there is a presumption that A did not intend to make a gift to B and the money or property is held on trust for A proportionate to his contribution. (b) Secondly, where A transfers property to B on an express trust, but the trust declared does not exhaust the whole beneficial interest, then a resulting trust would operate to fill the gap in the beneficial ownership of property where an express trust fails. 76 Where there is evidence of financial contributions made by parties towards the purchase price of a property, this would give rise to the presumption of a resulting trust. However, if there is sufficient evidence of the existence of an express or inferred common intention that parties should hold the beneficial interest in the property in a certain proportion, this gives rise to a common intention constructive trust which would override the presumption of a resulting trust. 77 Where the evidence gives rise to a finding of a presumed resulting trust butnota common intention constructive trust, if there is sufficient evidence that the party who paid a larger share of the purchase price intended to benefit the other party with the entire amount he had paid, then he would be considered to have made a gift to the other party of the larger sum. If this gift is not established, the presumption of advancement (which is attracted by relationships such as transfers from husband to wife or father to child) may nevertheless operate to rebut the presumption of resulting trust (Chan Yuen Lan v See FongMun[2014] 3 SLR 1048 at [160];Lau Siew Kimat [60]). 78 I briefly touch on the law of constructive trusts as this was pleaded by the plaintiff as well. A constructive trust is generally defined as a trust which arises by operation of law whenever the circumstances are such that it would be unconscionable for a property owner to assert his own beneficial interest in the property and deny the beneficial interest of another. Here, unconscionability is a necessary but not a sufficient condition:Koh Kim Eng v Lim Geok Yian[2001] 2 SLR(R) 812 at [33].Zaitonbte Adom v Nafsiah bte Wagiman and anor[2022] SGHC 189 (“Zaiton”). at [104]. 79 An institutional constructive trust arises in real-time without requiring any resort to a court of equity (whereas a remedial constructive trust has to be imposed by the court). It also arises independent of any intention on the part of the beneficiary or trustee to create a trust or to constitute the trustee as a trustee for the beneficiary (Zaitonbte Adom v Nafsiah bte Wagiman and anor[2022] SGHC 189 (“Zaiton”) at [103]–[111]). For aninstitutionalconstructive trust to arise, one of the following (non-exhaustive) categories of unconscionability must arise (Zaitonat [107]): (a) fraud; (b) the retention of property acquired as a result of a crime causing death; (c) a profit in breach of a fiduciary duty; (d) the retention of property by a vendor after the vendor had entered into a specifically enforceable contract to sell the property; (e) the changing of a will by the survivor of two persons who had entered into a contract to execute wills in a common form; (f) the acquisition of land expressly subject to the interests of a third party; (g) the assertion of full entitlement to property after a common intention to share property had been formed (also known as a “common intention constructive trust”). 80 As counsel for the defendants rightly submits, if Mdm Wang intends to rely on fraud as the circumstance under which an institutional constructive trust is founded in the present case, she will have to plead fraud not in terms of fraudsimpliciter, but in terms of a situation whereby the defendant fraudulently relies on the informality of a transaction to deny the beneficial interest of the claimant:National Bank of Oman SAOG Dubai Branch v BikashDhamala and others[2021] 3 SLR 943 at [52].99Foot Note 99×Defendants’ Closing Submissions (“DCS”) at para 135(a).This has not been done. In any event, counsel for Mdm Wang submits that Mdm Wang’s claim in trust pertains specifically to aresultingtrust.100Foot Note 100×Plaintiff’s Closing Submissions (“PCS”) at para 210. 81 A remedial constructive trust arises, as mentioned above, where the court imposes a constructive trustde novoon assets not subject to any pre-existing trust (Zaitonat [141], citingChing Mun Fong (executrix of the estate of TanGeok Tee, deceased) v Liu Cho Chit[2001] 1 SLR(R) 856). The Court of Appeal inWee Chiaw Sek Anna v Ng Li-Ann Genevieve (sole executrix of the estate of Ng Hock Seng, deceased) andanother[2013] 3 SLR 801 (“AnnaWee”) accepted (at [182]) that the power to impose a remedial constructive trust is part of Singapore law but constrained it by saying that it “is not simply a response to some broad notion of unconscionability”. Hence, a remedial constructive trust cannot be imposed unless there is “unconscientiousness or unconscionability (as the conclusion of a process of legal reasoning in the main claim) affecting the knowledge of the recipient of the assets in question” (Anna Weeat [182]). 82 As counsel for the defendants submits, Mdm Wang has not pleaded any cause of action that would justify the imposition of a remedial constructive trust in favour of Dr Goh;101Foot Note 101×DCS at para 135(b).neither does counsel for Mdm Wang appear to rely on the doctrine of remedial constructive trusts in its submissions. I therefore see no need to venture deeper into this point of law.",

It was on his directions that both properties were mortgaged in 2017153Foot Note 153×PCS at paras 113–147.and Dr Goh was the primary beneficiary from the mortgage proceeds.154Foot Note 154×PCS at paras 148–154.Mdm Koh and Dr Goh, and not Dr Jeremy, had handled the tenancy and maintenance of Seascape.155Foot Note 155×PCS at paras 156–158.Mdm Wang also submits that Dr Goh had directed the private sale of Seascape to Mr Ang at an undervalue in April 2021.156Foot Note 156×PCS at paras 155, 235–303. 117 Alternatively, counsel for Mdm Wang submits that Berth and Seascape are held on resulting trusts for Dr Goh as they were purchased with his monies, and he had no intention of conveying the beneficial ownership of the properties to Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy.157Foot Note 157×PCS at paras 222–224. 118 Mdm Wang hence submits that the court should order the properties to be sold at an auction to be held by herself or the Official Assignee, and for the proceeds of sale to be applied to satisfy any outstanding mortgage on the properties, and the remaining money to be held by the Official Assignee in favour of Dr Goh’s estate in bankruptcy.158Foot Note 158×PCS at para 225. 119 On the other hand, while the defendants do not dispute that Berth and Seascape were purchased with monies from the OCBC 501 Account, they maintain that these monies belonged solely to Mdm Koh and hence the purchases did not cause prejudice to Mdm Wang by reducing the pool of assets available to Dr Goh’s creditors.159Foot Note 159×DCS at paras 157–159, 179. 120 In any event, Dr Goh had no intention to defraud creditors – he did not have any creditors at the times of purchase and was wealthy even without receiving funds from Mdm Wang and Liberty Sky. Moreover, the purchase of the two properties was genuinely intended to benefit Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy.160Foot Note 160×DCS at paras 160–163, 180–185. 121 The defendants also submit that Mdm Wang’s claim in resulting trust fails as the true intention to gift the property to Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy is clear from the evidence, and the purchase price for both properties was paid by Mdm Koh using the joint OCBC 501 Account.161Foot Note 161×DCS at paras 164–168, 186–188.Even if a presumption of resulting trust arises, the presumption of advancement between parent and child will arise to rebut it. For both properties, the defendants submit that the children had valid and credible reasons (such as that of inconvenience) for not living in the properties after marriage and retained autonomy in dealings such as rental, security, and mortgage of the properties.162Foot Note 162×DCS at paras 169–175, 189–199.For Berth, the circumstantial evidence shows that Ms Melissa had received and expended the rental proceeds. For Seascape, the defendants highlight that one’s decision to use a gift in a manner that benefits the donor does not negate the gift or rebut the presumption of advancement. It is believable that Dr Jeremy would agree to put up Seascape as security and/or give his father the mortgage proceeds as he was grateful to his parents for his upbringing.163Foot Note 163×DCS at paras 198–199. 122 Lastly, no constructive trust exists in favour of Dr Goh as Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy have no knowledge of any alleged scheme to defeat, hinder or delay Dr Goh’s creditors and did not actively assist or abet Dr Goh in any attempt to do so.164Foot Note 164×DCS at paras 176–178 and 200–202.",
        "Whether Dr Goh’s monies had been conveyed into Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account": "86 The question of whether monies belonging to Dr Goh had been conveyed is premised on the preliminary question of whether the sum of S$18m in the OCBC 582 Account belonged to Dr Goh in the first place. Counsel for the defendants, in support of their position that the OCBC 582 Monies did not come from Dr Goh, highlight the provenance of the S$18m as follows:109Foot Note 109×DCS at paras 206, 211–223. (a) S$4,800,816.53 from Mdm Koh’s OCBC single account on 24 February 2016. (b) S$1,800,000 from Mdm Koh’s UOB Single account on 3 March 2016. (c) S$212,006.12 from Mdm Koh’s DBS single account on 8 March 2016. (d) S$3,352,509.61 from Mdm Koh and Ms Melissa’s OCBC joint account on 4 March 2016. (e) S$918,648.38 from Mdm Koh and Ms Melissa’s BOS joint account, and S$1,954.663.98 from Mdm Koh and Dr Michelle’s BOS joint account on 7 March 2016. (f) S$1,873,320.63 from Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s joint OCBC 501 Account on 7 March 2016. (g) S$640,071.71 from Mdm Koh’s joint HSBC account on 8 March 2016. (h) $933,989.52 from Mdm Koh’s joint DBS account on 9 March 2016. (i) $265,000 over 4 March 2016 and 11 March 2016 from Ms Melissa’s single OCBC account. 87 I do not find there to be sufficient evidence to suggest that Dr Goh had an interest in monies transferred from accounts not belonging to him (see above at [86(a)]–[86(e)] and [86(g)]–[86(i)]). In fact, Mdm Wang’s submissions only go so far as to say that Dr Goh hadbenefittedfrom monies in bank accounts not belonging to him.110Foot Note 110×PCS at para 58.Mdm Wang’s submissions focus on the monies in accounts which were held either solely by Mdm Koh or jointly with Dr Goh; for the purposes of this issue I will hence consider primarily the S$1,873,320.63 transferred from Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s joint OCBC 501 Account on 7 March 2016 (see above at 86(f)). The monies in the OCBC 501 Account are jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh 88 Counsel for Mdm Wang submits that the monies in the OCBC 501 Account were solely owned by Dr Goh while Mdm Koh operated the account with his permission. The account was funded by monies owned by Dr Goh, who had accessed monies in the account without any protest from Mdm Koh and liberally transferred or caused to be transferred monies between this account and another joint account. Further, the monies in the OCBC 501 Account were used to pay for Dr Goh’s essential expenses and not that of Mdm Koh.111Foot Note 111×PCS at paras 25-–31. 89 On the other hand, the defendants submit that regardless of who contributed the monies in the joint OCBC 501 Account, Mdm Koh was the sole owner of the monies and controlled how it was spent. Dr Goh had been named as a holder of the bank account purely for probate reasons and had set up other singly-held bank accounts to demarcate monies owned by himself from monies owned by Mdm Koh.112Foot Note 112×DCS at paras 137–148. 90 It is not disputed that both Dr Goh and Mdm Koh had transferred their earnings into the OCBC 501 Account and that Dr Goh earned significantly more than Mdm Koh did.113Foot Note 113×Transcript of 15 Sep 2022 p 130 ln 23 to p 131 ln 12.The question at hand is whether the monies, once deposited in the OCBC 501 Account, were given to Mdm Koh for her sole use and control.114Foot Note 114×Transcript of 14 April 2022 at p 182 ln 19 to ln 25; Transcript of 15 Sep 2022 p 131 ln 19 to p 132 ln 11. 91 I am of the view that Mdm Koh was not the sole owner of the monies in Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s joint OCBC 501 Account. While Mdm Koh attempts to suggest that she was in control of the monies and how they could be used, this is not borne out by the evidence. In submissions and during trial, counsel for Mdm Wang drew attention to a transfer of S$3m out of the joint OCBC 501 Account into Dr Goh’s sole Citibank account a few weeks after he had transferred S$6m from that same Citibank account into the joint OCBC 501 Account in January 2015.115Foot Note 115×PCS at para 28.When questioned on this transfer of S$3m, Dr Goh’s evidence was as follows: Q. So you're saying that you demanded [S]$3 million, and your wife just gave it back to you, never asked you what it was for? A. I asked her for the money. Q. But she never asked you, \"Why are you asking for this money back? It's mine already\"? A. I believe that I have given her so much over the last 30 years -- Q. It's not what you believe. The question I asked you is: what did she ask you, or did she ask you anything in giving you the money? A. I asked her for [S$]3 million, and she gave it to me. Q. Just like that? A. For the large amount that I've given her, I believe she would have given me without asking a question. COURT: Dr Goh, answer the question. Did she ask you what you wanted the money for? A. No, I don't think so. Thank you. MR YIM: And she put up no resistance whatsoever? A. Not at that time.116Foot Note 116×Transcript of 14 April 2022 p 184 ln 22 to p 185 ln 16. 92 When cross-examined on the same transfer of S$3m, Mdm Koh stated that her reason for doing so was that Dr Goh must have asked her for money for “business” reasons.117Foot Note 117×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 109 ln 7 to ln 22.Despite acknowledging that it was a large sum of money, she could not remember why there was a movement of S$3m or why the sum was exactly S$3m. When pressed further on why she would have transferred such a large sum suddenly, she merely stated that “this is [her] husband” whom she was transferring money to.118Foot Note 118×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 108 ln 14 to p 110 ln 2.She further stated that this was not the first time he had asked for money in this fashion and that while she knew he was asking for monies to buy shares at one point, that “he [does not] really want to tell [her]” for “other reasons”.119Foot Note 119×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 111 ln 19 to p 112 ln 5. 93 It appears to me that despite their assertions to the contrary, Dr Goh and Mdm Koh appeared to treat the monies in the OCBC 501 Account as belonging to both of them. It does not appear that Mdm Koh’s permission was material to Dr Goh’s withdrawals from the OCBC 501 Account or that she had knowledge of what his withdrawals would be for – neither does she seem to have expressed any interest or ability to find out before approving such money transfers. Against this factual backdrop, the claim that Mdm Koh was the owner of the monies and that Dr Goh’s name had been added to the account only for probate purposes is untenable. 94 Mdm Koh’s conduct vis-à-vis another joint account between herself and Dr Goh (the “BOS Joint Account”) is also consistent with the approach of treating monies in their joint accounts as a common pool owned by both of them. As with the OCBC 501 Account, Mdm Koh took the position that she, too, had sole ownership of the BOS Joint Account. She said that the BOS Joint Account was opened with the “private banking arm” of OCBC Bank, and since she owned the OCBC 501 Account, the BOS Joint Account would also be owned by her.120Foot Note 120×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 71 ln 24 to p 73 ln 3.Mdm Koh acknowledged that Dr Goh had made significant share purchases using money from the BOS Joint Account,121Foot Note 121×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 77 ln 9 to to p 79 ln 25.whereas she did not approve of all his investments, and preferred to use monies in the BOS Joint Account to trade in smaller sums of monies or through purchasing less risky financial products that had a longer maturity period.122Foot Note 122×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 80 ln 8 to p 81 ln 12.When asked why she would allow Dr Goh to expose monies that were supposedly under her sole ownership to risks, she said that “You can't say ‘no’ to him all the time … We would be quarrelling all day” and that she tried “not to irritate him”.123Foot Note 123×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 82 ln 10 to p 83 ln 7.That being said, it was highlighted that save for Dr Goh’s purchase of shares in AirAsia, she hadneverrefused his investments using monies in the BOS Joint Account. Mdm Koh resisted the suggestion that she could not refuse as Dr Goh had a beneficial interest in the monies, explaining that “if he [makes] money, what can I say?”124Foot Note 124×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 83 ln 8 to ln 18. 95 The next inconsistency in Mdm Koh’s story pertains to the instance where she had refused Dr Goh’s purchase of AirAsia shares using the BOS Joint Account. She stated that as she did not approve of the purchase, he then transferred monies into the BOS Joint Account from his sole account for the purchase.125Foot Note 125×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 85 ln 2 to ln 6.However, she did not appear to reimburse the monies to him after the shares were sold,126Foot Note 126×Agreed Bundle of Documents (Volume 9) (“9AB”) p 4791.and Dr Goh said that when stocks (even those she did not approve of buying) had gone up in value, she would still be the one keeping the profits.127Foot Note 127×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 47 ln 5 to ln 10.This appears to be more consistent with the common pool approach than the clear delineation of joint account assets (as belonging to Mdm Koh only) and assets that stayed within Dr Goh’s sole ownership. 96 Additionally, the defendants’ position that the monies in the OCBC 501 Account belonged solely to Mdm Koh is also inconsistent with the earlier affidavit evidence provided by Dr Goh in previous suits as to his assets. In Suit 111, Dr Goh had been ordered to disclose all assets in his name and whether he solely or jointly owned it. Pursuant to this disclosure order, he then stated on affidavit that the monies in the OCBC 501 Account belonged jointly to him and his wife.128Foot Note 128×Transcript of 14 April 2022 at p 75 ln 17 to ln 22.Dr Goh sought to explain this by saying that the joint ownership was only “in name” and that he “could have been more clear” and stated that “the joint accounts [belong] to [his] wife, although in name it’s jointly owned”. When pressed on why it was so difficult for him to have stated that and why he had declared in 2016 that the account was jointly owned, Dr Goh could not come up with any explanation, merely reiterating that he was not clear in that affidavit.129Foot Note 129×Transcript of 14 April 2022 at p 76 ln 8 to p 77 ln 20. 97 Moreover, although Dr Goh stated that he had not been involved in the decision to gift S$18m to Dr Jeremy,130Foot Note 130×Transcript of 14 April 2022 p 113 ln 3 to ln 20.the decrease in Dr Goh’s assets between March 2016 and November 2016 corresponds to the transfer of this sum into the OCBC 582 Account. Counsel for Mdm Wang raised that in Dr Goh’s affidavit of means (“AOM”) filed November 2016, he stated that he only had one bank account containing $34,546,81 left in a sole bank account, down from around $19m in several bank accounts (including the BOS joint account, the OCBC 501 Account and the OCBC 582 Account) declared in his March 2016 AOM.131Foot Note 131×Agreed Bundle of Documents (Volume 2) (“2AB”) p 842–843, 1098.Counsel suggests that this was because Dr Goh and his family had in May 2016 discussed the matter of gifting the monies to Dr Jeremy. Apart from repeatedly asserting that the $18m was not his and stating that the March 2016 affidavit was “miscommunicated”, Dr Goh did not appear to be able to explain why he had changed his position at that point in time.132Foot Note 132×Transcript of 14 April 2022 p 114 ln 4 to p 118 ln 14. 98 In essence, I am unpersuaded by Mdm Koh’s overall assertion that Dr Goh had told her that all the money he earned, or money he put in their joint accounts would belong to her, for three reasons. First, Dr Goh did not seem to have any problem getting large sums of money from her out of those accounts or from their children’s accounts which were pumped up from money from Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s joint accounts. As such, the manner in which they treated the money in their OCBC 501 Account and BOS Joint Account is not consistent with this assertion. Second, Mdm Koh does not satisfactorily explain Dr Goh’s access to the monies other than that he had a bad temper, and nobody dared refuse him. Thirdly, Mdm Koh relies solely on oral evidence. While her oral evidence is corroborated by Dr Goh, he has an interest in the matter at hand and his own evidence in this regard has not been consistent either. More importantly, her evidence in the witness box is not convincing, with quite a few unbelievable answers and shifting evidence, and she has contradicted herself in the previous affidavits she had filed. Conveyance of monies 99 I hence find that there had been a conveyance of monies belonging to Dr Goh to Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account – specifically, the sum of S$1,873,320.63 transferred from Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s joint OCBC 501 Account on 7 March 2016.",
        "Whether this conveyance was made with the intent of defrauding creditors": "100 According to the defendants, the conveyance was made in return for Dr Jeremy’s agreeing to put up the Seascape property as security. I note that Dr Jeremy was unable to provide concrete details surrounding this provision of consideration on his part. He vaguely stated that Dr Goh and Dr Michelle had probably stated “the situation” to him after which he offered his property as security. However, when questioned further, Dr Jeremy stated that he could not remember to whom this request was made in the presence of, whether any group discussions were had regarding the putting up of Seascape to discharge an injunction, any conversations he might have had with Dr Goh in their WhatsApp chat groups where Dr Goh had said “he needed help” as well as who had come up with the idea of mortgaging Seascape.133Foot Note 133×Transcript of 13 September 2022 at p 171 ln 5 to p 181 ln 21.Neither could he recollect any details of precisely when and where the “family discussion” at which he had been told that his mother and two sisters agreed to gift over S$18m to him had occurred, save that it occurred at 36 Cove Way sometime in May.134Foot Note 134×Transcript of 14 September 2022 at p 109 ln 17 to p 112 ln 4.Dr Jeremy’s account of events (or more accurately, his complete inability to provide an account of events) is odd at best and suspicious at worst. 101 In any event, even assuming that the defendants are to be believed in saying that consideration was made for Dr Goh’s transference of monies into the OCBC 582 Account, I am of the view that that Dr Goh had acted with the actual intent to defraud creditors and Dr Jeremy had notice of Dr Goh’s fraudulent intention. My reasons are as follows. 102 First, Dr Goh appeared to be very much involved in transactions involving the OCBC 582 Account. During the examination of Dr Goh, counsel for Mdm Wang highlighted several instances where Dr Goh had stated on affidavit that he had an interest in the OCBC 582 Account. For one, Dr Goh had stated in March 2016 that “[t]he money in the account is family money … it is jointly owned by my [w]ife, my children and me for our joint family investments”. Dr Goh’s explanation was that the S$18m did not come from him or from any of his single bank accounts.135Foot Note 135×Transcript of 14 April 2022 at p 87 ln 15 to p 88 ln 13; 2AB at p 843.When it was suggested to him that the judge in Suit 1311 had understood that Dr Goh had an interest in the S$18m in Dr Jeremy’s account and that Dr Goh’s counsel then had not corrected the judge on this point, Dr Goh’s response was that “my counsel was incorrect”.136Foot Note 136×Transcript of 14 April 2022 at p 94 ln 22 to p 95 ln 12.Dr Goh’s responses were not able to address why he had in previous lawsuits declared to the court that he had an interest in the OCBC 582 Account. 103 Moreover, even though Dr Jeremy claimed that the OCBC 582 Account bank statements were not shared with his family, when questioned on why Dr Goh appeared to know the amount in the account as of 17 March 2016 (which Dr Goh had declared in his AOM137Foot Note 137×2AB at p 843.), Dr Jeremy began by saying he did not know if he had shared with his father how much money he had in his accounts at the time. Dr Jeremy went on to say that Dr Goh had “probably asked” him, but then stated that he could not remember specifically if he had been asked by Dr Goh.138Foot Note 138×Transcript of 15 September 2022 at p 47 ln 3 to p 48 ln 2. 104 Second, Mdm Wang relied on a WhatsApp message sent on 12 February 2016 by Dr Michelle in a group chat comprising her and the rest of Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s children (the “Elves Group Chat Message”139Foot Note 139×15DPD; Transcript of 15 September 2022 at p 32 ln 16 to ln 19.). In that message, Dr Michelle stated that: This morning [Dr Goh] said that he is prepared to go bankrupt, divorce [Mdm Koh] and transfer all the assets to us. So that if they sue him or [Mdm Koh], they will get nothing. 105 Dr Jeremy acknowledged that he understood the message in its plain meaning but that he believed that Dr Michelle may have exaggerated the matter.140Foot Note 140×Transcript of 15 September 2022 at p 32 ln 23 to p 33 ln 23.Dr Jeremy denied that when he received the various transfers soon after receiving the message, he knew these monies had come from Dr Goh, and instead stated that they came from his mother and siblings.141Foot Note 141×Transcript of 15 September 2022 at p 38 ln 1 to ln 10. 106 However, Dr Jeremy’s claim is shaken by the third reason, which is that Dr Jeremy has not been able to furnish any satisfactory explanation – or any explanation at all – as to why he had then transferred out monies of S$18.465m to his HSBC account in May 2016, and then disbursed S$15m of that sum to Dr Goh on his request, through Ms Melissa on three occasions between August to November 2016.142Foot Note 142×Jeremy Goh’s AEIC at paras 43–47. 107 With regard to his transfer of over S$18m to his HSBC account on 9 May 2016, Dr Jeremy explained, vaguely and without certainty, that he “may have wanted to transfer to another of [his] bank accounts”. Dr Jeremy acknowledged that the decision to gift the beneficial interest in the monies to him had not been made by his family before May 2016. When asked why he was transferring out monies which were not really his own, Dr Jeremy’s justification was that it was his business which account he put the money in, and that he did not recall the details of why he had shifted it to his HSBC account.143Foot Note 143×Jeremy Goh’s AEIC at para 43; Transcript of 14 September 2022 at p 121 ln 19 to p 122 ln 20. 108 With regard to the monies transferred to Ms Melissa on three occasions at Dr Goh’s request, Dr Goh testified that he had told Dr Jeremy he needed S$15m for “business” and that Dr Jeremy “did not protest” at this.144Foot Note 144×Transcript of 9 Sept 2022 at p 48 ln 2 to ln 13.Dr Jeremy himself stated that his father had said “he needed help and that this was for both business and legal expenses”, but he could not remember if his father had asked for the exact sums he had transferred each time, or whether his father had asked for the total sum of S$15m to be transferred in three tranches (though he did not think the latter scenario was as likely).145Foot Note 145×Transcript of 15 Sept 2022 at p 5 ln 1 to p 7 ln 17. 109 Taking the evidence in its totality, the picture that emerges is as follows. Dr Jeremy had received his alleged gift of S$18m in the OCBC 582 Account, which Dr Goh had at points declared to the court was an account in which he had joint ownership and was aware of the precise quantities of monies held therein. Within a few months of receiving a WhatsApp message from Dr Michelle on Dr Goh’s willingness to transfer his assets to his family and go bankrupt so that his creditors would get nothing, Dr Jeremy then proceeded to transfer S$18m into his HSBC account, and then to route much of that sum to Dr Goh via Ms Melissa. Dr Goh was not able to explain away his seeming knowledge and involvement in transactions involving the OCBC 582 Account, and it is undisputed that he had eventually directed that S$15m be routed back to him. 110 Dr Jeremy has not been able to furnish any alternative explanation as to why he had gone about making these transfers. The extent to which he appears to have purged details of any understanding or discussions he may have had with Dr Goh regarding these monies and their movement from his memory is so thorough as to be incredible. There is simply no ring of truth to his account that he accepted the monies as a gift and subsequently transferred the monies to his father purely to help him financially. I find from the evidence that the conveyancing of monies into Dr Jeremy’s account from Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s OCBC 501 Account had been orchestrated by Dr Goh with the intent to defraud his creditors, and Dr Jeremy had notice of Dr Goh’s intention to do so.",
        "Whether the plaintiff is a person prejudiced by the foregoing conveyance of property": "111 While it is true (as the defendants highlight in their submissions) that judgment against Dr Goh in Suit 686 and Suit 1311 was only obtained in 2019, the suits were commenced in 2015. Dr Goh’s conveyance of monies over the course of 2016 would directly impact whether Mdm Wang would be able to enjoy the fruits of litigation in the event that she should succeed in Suit 686 (as she eventually did), and she was hence prejudiced by the conveyance made.",
        "Alternative claim of resulting trusts": "112 As I have found that Dr Goh’s conveyance of monies from the OCBC 501 Account into Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account is voidable under s 73B of the CLPA, I need not address the alternative claim on whether a presumption of resulting trust arises in Dr Goh’s favour vis-à-vis his contributions into Dr Jeremy’s OCBC 582 Account. Briefly, I note that for the reasons I have given above, the presumption that the money is held on trust for Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, proportionate to their contribution, has been established by Mdm Wang. 113 The defendants submit that any resulting trust arising in Dr Goh’s favour would be rebutted by the presumption of advancement.146Foot Note 146×DCS at paras 133 and 242–249.However, given that I have found that Dr Goh and Mdm Koh did not intend to gift the monies to Dr Jeremy and that Dr Goh had intended to route the monies back to himself in a way that would evade his creditors, the presumption of advancement does not arise.",

        "Preliminary finding: Dr Goh was involved in the purchase and gifting of Seascape and Berth": "123 Having found above that the funds in the OCBC 501 Account are jointlyowned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, it stands to reason that the properties purchased using monies from the OCBC 501 Account were purchased by both Dr Goh and Mdm Koh and not by Mdm Koh alone. 124 Moreover, the evidence gives rise to a strong inference that Mdm Koh had not acted alone in buying the properties in her children’s names. Contrary to Mdm Koh’s position that Seascape was a gift from only her to Dr Jeremy, Dr Jeremy’s evidence is that he “thought [Seascape] was from the both of [his parents]”.165Foot Note 165×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 122 ln 6 to ln 11.While he acknowledged that Seascape was the first huge property gift he had received in his life, he could proffer no recollection of what his parents had told him regarding the gift beyond saying that his mother had told him about it. Dr Jeremy was unable to definitively say whether his father had affirmed that it was a gift from both parents or not.166Foot Note 166×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 123 ln 3 to p 124 ln 18. 125 I also find Mdm Koh’s evidence that she had gifted the property as “the money [came] from [her]” whereas Dr Goh only “morally supported” that decision167Foot Note 167×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 23 ln 18 to p 24 ln 6.untenable in the face of her original pleadings and her inconsistent affidavit evidence. 126 First, it was only in her pleadings, as amended in April 2022, and her further affidavit filed in June 2022, that she made clear that the monies in the OCBC 501 Account were under, not just her ownership, but hersoleownership, and that she was hence thesolegiver of Berth and Seascape.168Foot Note 168×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 10 ln 2 to ln 8.Mdm Koh sought to draw a distinction between her and Dr Goh’s decision to give the properties (which she says was made jointly) and the payments for the properties which were made from the account she claimed to own alone.169Foot Note 169×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 21 ln 16 to ln 18.The artificiality of this distinction was pointed out to her when counsel for Mdm Wang queried that “if [Dr Goh] didn’t have anything to give, what is there to give?”170Foot Note 170×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 21 ln 25 to p 22 ln 1.To this, Mdm Koh could only repeatedly state that in her understanding, it was good enough to say that she owned the monies.171Foot Note 171×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 22 ln 6 to ln 7; p 23 ln 1 to ln 3. 127 The unpersuasive nature of such an explanation is exacerbated by the different position taken in Mdm Koh’s affidavit evidence for Suit 1311 in 2017. Her evidence in Suit 1311 was that she and Dr Goh had “purchased” the Berth and Seascape property for Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy. When cross-examined on this, Mdm Koh protested that she did not know how else she could have crafted the same sentence. When it was suggested to her that she could have stated what she wrote in her present affidavit for this suit,ie, that she had used monies belonging to her and was the sole giver, Mdm Koh could only make the feeble excuse that writing that would be “easy for [counsel for Mdm Wang], but not easy for me”.172Foot Note 172×Transcript of 16 September 2022 p 24 ln 7 to p 27 ln 2.In other words, Mdm Koh was unable to explain why she could not have come clean from the start or to reconcile her shifting positions on the purchases of Berth and Seascape across multiple suits.",
        "The purchase of Seascape is voidable under s 73B of the CLPA": "128 I am of the view that the purchase of Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name is voidable under s 73B of the CLPA. 129 On a balance of probabilities, it appears Dr Goh had made this gift of Seascape to Dr Jeremy with the intent to defraud his creditors. The suggestion of such an intent is found in the Elves Group Chat Message sent by Dr Michelle in February 2016. This was corroborated in respect of Seascape by the conduct of Dr Goh and his family members – namely, in effecting the mortgage of Seascape and in arranging for its private sale to Mr Ang. 130 I begin by highlighting Dr Goh’s messages in a WhatsApp chat group, “Internal Party Property”, which appear to evince that he was not only in control of Seascape but also exercising this control with the aim of defrauding his creditors. The chat group was created by Dr Goh on 18 April 2017 and included Dr Jeremy, Ms Melissa, Mr Lee and the Finance Manager of AMP,173Foot Note 173×Goh Seng Heng’s affidavit for Suit 636 dated 7 April 2022 at p 548.Chan Yue Kwan (referred to as “Ms Denie”).174Foot Note 174×Goh Seng Heng’s affidavit for Suit 636 dated 7 April 2022 at para 180; GSH-1 Annex Z.He stated that “we need to convert asset to cash n we need to caveat both properties away from vultures” (the “Vultures Message”). During trial, Dr Goh clarified that “vultures” referred to persons who had sued him, including Mdm Wang.175Foot Note 175×Transcript of 9 September 2022 at p 10 ln 10 to ln 14.He had also addressed a message to Ms Melissa and Dr Jeremy to “please assist [Ms] Denie [and] [Mr Lee] to furnish information … to assist the processing of the loan”.176Foot Note 176×Goh Seng Heng’s affidavit for Suit 636 dated 7 April 2022 at para 180; GSH-1 Annex Z. 131 Dr Jeremy stated that he had opened but never read the Vultures Message or Dr Goh’s subsequent message instructing him to assist Ms Denie and Mr Lee. Oddly enough, however, he stated that he had managed to read Ms Denie’s private message to him on the same day asking for documentation required to effect the mortgage.177Foot Note 177×Transcript of 15 September 2022 p 12 ln 2 to p 15 ln 24. 132 When asked why he could read Ms Denie’s private message and not Dr Goh’s group message, he merely said that he was busy and had a lot of group chats, and so he would not read all the messages in his group chats all the time. Further, he said that he was not interested in the creation of this new chat group or the fact that his father had addressed a specific request to him, as he had discussed the matter with his father beforehand.178Foot Note 178×Transcript of 15 September 2022 p 12 ln 2 to p 15 ln 24.I found this to be an unconvincing explanation of why Dr Jeremy had selectively read some messages pertaining to the mortgage of Seascape but not others, when these messages pertained to the same matter and were sent in the same time frame. The story put before this court is hence that Dr Jeremy was aware that he was to mortgage Seascape and had proceeded to work with Ms Denie (who had been asked by Dr Goh to assist) to do so but had conveniently missed out on the messages which would highlight any intent to defraud creditors in mortgaging Seascape. 133 Further, the bulk of the mortgage proceeds from both properties either went back to Dr Goh or was used for his benefit.179Foot Note 179×PCS at para 220; Defence at para 111(b).It is clear that Dr Goh had the power to direct how Seascape was to be dealt with, and the mortgage was orchestrated by Dr Goh to keep them away from his creditors. 134 The subsequent auction of Seascape to Mr Ang was also carried out under spurious circumstances. Seascape had been put up for public auction on 8 April 2021 at the reserve price of S$8.5m. Mr Ang was the only bidder and began bidding at S$4.41m. His bid was not accepted as it was too low, and Seascape was withdrawn from the auction. After the auction ended, Mr Ang made a S$4.5m counteroffer, which was accepted.180Foot Note 180×Jeremy Goh’s Supplementary AEIC at para 32–38; Bernard Ang’s affidavit dated 12 July 2021 at paras 43–44 and p 221. 135 Mdm Wang’s case is that Dr Goh’s calls with Mr Ang on the day of the auction were part of a conspiracy for Mr Ang to buy Seascape at an undervalue.181Foot Note 181×PCS at para 155.Dr Jeremy, however, claims that he was the one who had given Mr Lee instructions on the auction day via Telegram calls, and that he had consented to the counteroffered price of S$4.5m as he believed this was the best possible price he could get.182Foot Note 182×Transcript of 14 September 2022 p 56 ln 24 to p 57 ln 19; Jeremy Goh’s Supplementary AEIC at para 30. 136 However, Dr Jeremy’s version of events is unsupported by evidence. Although he claims to be the person instructing Mr Lee on the auction day, no calls or messages were discovered on Dr Jeremy’s phone. Dr Jeremy stated on affidavit that he did not know why records of his calls did not appear in the data extracted from his phone183Foot Note 183×PCS at p 85.and that he did not know what had become of the call logs. Only at trial did Dr Jeremy say that he had a practice of regularly deleting his Telegram messages and calls.184Foot Note 184×Transcript of 13 September 2022 at p 134 ln 4 to p 135 ln 24.It was put to him that he had hence not been telling the truth when he said he did not know what had become of “them”. Dr Jeremy disagreed, saying: I was responding that I did not have it any more [sic] and that I do not know what has become of the data.185Foot Note 185×Transcript of 15 September 2022 p 59 ln 14 to ln 16. He also stated that what he did not know was “after I delete, what has become of it, is it retrievable, is it not”.186Foot Note 186×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 139 ln 5 to ln 7. 137 This attempt to reconcile his assertion that he did not know what had become of the call logs with his admission that he had deleted them smacks of prevarication. At no point had Dr Jeremy been ordered to furnish evidence on the possibility of retrieving deleted data from Telegram. He had only been asked to account for what had happened to those logs. It would have been easy for Dr Jeremy to say from the outset that he had deleted his Telegram logs. Saying that it was the “data” he did not know about rather than the call logs suggests that he had, in his original statements, been trying to draw a ludicrously fine distinction between the messages and the data constituting them. 138 The suspicious nature of the sale of Seascape is reinforced by the calls exchanged between Dr Goh and Mr Ang on the same day of 8 April 2021. I begin by noting that Mr Ang has declined to testify. His phone records pertaining to that period of time have also been lost as his Old Phone was damaged. The expert opinions produced by Mdm Wang concluded that the Old Phone was soaked in seawater rather than dropped accidentally in the toilet, as Mr Ang claimed, and their evidence has not been shaken in cross-examination. 139 Given the loss of records from Mr Ang’s Old Phone, all we have to rely on is Dr Goh’s evidence of their communications on the day of the auction. I find his evidence in this regard to be highly inconsistent and not credible. 140 As mentioned above, Dr Goh’s affidavit evidence was that he had called Mr Ang on 8 April 2021 to wish him a happy birthday and discovered then that Mr Ang was attending the auction. On the same day, Mr Ang called Dr Goh and told him he had placed a deposit to buy Seascape. In cross-examination, it was highlighted to Dr Goh that his evidence was only of two calls and hence did not account for all ten calls that were made between him and Mr Ang on 8 April 2021.187Foot Note 187×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 53 ln 23 to ln 25.To this, Dr Goh said that there were “some other conversations going on, so [he does not] believe there was [sic] only two [calls]”188Foot Note 188×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 54 ln 3 to ln 7.and that “this is [an] incomplete affidavit”189Foot Note 189×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 54 ln 12.. Again (as seen above at [102]), Dr Goh appears to discard his earlier evidence when the inconsistencies between his past and present positions were highlighted, with no satisfactory explanation for them. 141 Further, it was highlighted to Dr Goh that the calls had been made at timings which coincided with developments at the auction. It appeared that Mr Ang had called Dr Goh at the start of the auction, again after Mr Lee had been advised on the opening bid, a third time after Mr Lee had given instructions to open the bidding at the price of S$4.4m, two more times after Mr Lee confirmed this opening price and four more times when the property was withdrawn from the auction. After Mr Ang’s counteroffer was made and the deal was concluded, Mr Ang then made a final call to Dr Goh.190Foot Note 190×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 44 ln 21 to p 50 ln 3.However, Dr Goh did not provide any concrete explanation of why they had exchanged these calls and gave dismissive answers such as this one:191Foot Note 191×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 54 ln 13 to 24. Q. As we’ve established, you no longer had any more business, gambling business with [Mr] Ang. Why were there all these long, long phone calls you had with him that coincided with what was happening at the auction? A. Your Honour, we have been buddies for more than about [ten] years, since 2010, so just because I don’t go gambling means we cannot have fellowship, breakfast, calls regularly, so that’s -- your narrative accusing me that [Mr] Ang have [sic] no longer talk to me because I’m no more a gambler, no money to gamble, he's not that kind of person. 142 The issue at hand was not whether he was still friends or in contact with Mr Ang; the vague justification that they still had fellowship, meals and calls on a regular basis does nothing to explain why as many astenphone calls were made in one day, in uncanny coincidence with developments at the auction of Seascape. In sum, Dr Goh was a witness whose glib and evasive responses did little to reconcile the gaps and inconsistencies in his evidence. Given the timing and volume of calls made on 8 April 2021, coupled with Dr Goh’s inconsistent and sketchy evidence of these calls, I find that Dr Goh had been involved in the sale of Seascape by private treaty at S$4.5m. I also find that Mr Ang’s Old Phone had, more likely than not, been contaminated, probably by immersing it in seawater. 143 I am hence of the view that Dr Goh had purchased Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name with the intent to defraud his creditors, and that Dr Jeremy had notice of Dr Goh’s intention to do so. Further, Mdm Wang would be prejudiced by this purchase. The sale and purchase agreement for Seascape was signed on 29 May 2015 and the sale to Dr Jeremy was completed on 11 August 2015,192Foot Note 192×SOC at paras 54–55.after the commencement of Suits 686 and 546. Mdm Wang, being a litigant in Suits 686 and 546, is hence a person prejudiced by the purchase.",
        "In the alternative, Dr Jeremy holds Seascape on resulting trust in Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s favour": "144 Even if I am wrong in finding that the purchase of Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name is caught by s 73B of the CLPA, the presumption of resulting trust would still arise insofar as Seascape was paid for using monies jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh. 145 The evidence militates against any possibility that this is a gift. Neither would the presumption of advancement arise to defeat this presumption of a resulting trust. As mentioned above, Dr Jeremy has little distinct recollection as to the circumstances under which the alleged gift of Seascape was extended to him. Moreover, not only is his evidence on the making of this gift patchy, Dr Jeremy does not appear to have treated Seascape as a gift under his ownership. 146 Although Dr Jeremy’s evidence is that he “made the decisions” relating to the renting of Seascape after completion, this is not borne out by the evidence.193Foot Note 193×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 125 ln 7.The documentary evidence reflects that Dr Jeremy and his parents were in a chat group with their property agent, in which a discussion was conducted in 2017 on renewing their tenants’ lease.194Foot Note 194×9AB at p 4974.Dr Jeremy stated on the stand that he did not remember if there were any other persons in the group chat and who had started the group195Foot Note 195×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 127 ln 15 to ln 23.– it was later pointed out to him that in his own affidavit he had stated that the group was created by Mdm Koh and comprised multiple individuals including Mr Lee and Ms Denie.196Foot Note 196×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 130 ln 1 to p 131 ln 15. 147 It also appears that Mdm Koh was very much involved in matters relating to Seascape, such as reminding him to ensure rent and property tax had been paid and to confirm the arrangements for paying fire insurance.197Foot Note 197×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 157 ln 22 to p160 ln 20.She would also keep track of the precise amounts of rent paid.198Foot Note 198×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 162 ln 2 to p 164 ln 14.When questioned on his mother’s involvement in managing the property, Dr Jeremy denied that he was reporting to his mother on the property, stating instead that she was “just trying to help”.199Foot Note 199×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 164 ln 11 to ln 14.Neither does Dr Jeremy appear to have made any decisions in the chat groups with the agents, although he claimed that he was making the decisions at home and communicating them verbally to Mdm Koh.200Foot Note 200×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 165 ln 10 to p 166 ln 16. 148 Further, not only did Dr Jeremy not live in or manage the rental of the property at all, he mortgaged it on Dr Goh’s instructions and gave the mortgage proceeds to him. The sale of Seascape also appears to have been orchestrated and directed by Dr Goh without Dr Jeremy’s involvement. 149 In light of the above evidence, the presumption of advancement does not apply, and Dr Jeremy cannot therefore be considered the true owner of Seascape.",
        "The purchase of Berth is not voidable under s 73B of the CLPA": "150 As for Berth, the property purchased in Ms Melissa’s name, I do not think that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing that Dr Goh had purchased Berth with an intent to defraud creditors. 151 To reiterate, the sale and purchase agreement for Berth was entered into in November 2014, and the purchase was completed in February 2015.201Foot Note 201×SOC at para 44–45.The evidence is insufficient to suggest that in November 2014, Dr Goh had harboured any intention to defraud his creditors. Rather, both Dr Goh and Mdm Wang’s evidence is that they still shared a positive relationship in February 2015, and Mdm Wang had not informed Dr Goh of her intention to commence proceedings at that point.202Foot Note 202×Transcript of 1 March 2022 at p 29 ln 14 to p 33 ln 16; Transcript of 9 September 2022 at p 173 ln 3 to ln 21; Goh Seng Heng’s Affidavit filed 7 April 2022 at para 65.",
        "Ms Melissa holds Berth on a resulting trust in Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s favour": "152 As is the case with Seascape, since I have found that the funds in the OCBC 501 Account are jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, it follows that Berth was purchased with those funds by both Dr Goh and Mdm Koh. The presumption of resulting trust arises such that the beneficial interest in Berth falls to Dr Goh and Mdm Koh. 153 I find that Dr Goh and Mdm Koh did not intend to gift Berth to Ms Melissa. Also, the presumption of advancement does not arise to defeat my finding of a presumed resulting trust. The evidence, in fact, suggests the opposite – that Dr Goh and Mdm Koh appeared in control of Berth and all that was done with it. 154 The tenancy and maintenance of Berth were handled by Mdm Koh. Ms Melissa claimed that she would tell Mdm Koh about tenancy and maintenance matters and Mdm Koh would communicate Ms Melissa’s instructions to the agent.203Foot Note 203×Transcript of 6 October 2022 at p 122 ln 11 to p 123 ln 3.Although Ms Melissa claimed that there would have been correspondence between herself and Mdm Koh regarding the tenancy and maintenance of Berth, she also stated that she no longer had this correspondence as she deleted her WhatsApp and Telegram messages approximately once a year.204Foot Note 204×Transcript of 6 October 2022 at p 123 ln 4 to p 124 ln 25.It was then pointed out to her that she had been asked on April 2022 to check for written communications on her phone regarding a tenancy agreement concluded less than a year prior. In response, Ms Melissa stated that in early 2022, her young son had accidentally deleted her messaging application by pressing on it for too long, and she was not able to restore the messages in time.205Foot Note 205×Transcript of 6 October 2022 at p 125 ln 2 to p 127 ln 1.However, Ms Melissa made no mention of her habit of deleting messages or of her son’s deletion of her messages in the leadup to trial in her affidavit evidence, merely stating that she was not able to locate or access the correspondence. She justified her omission to do so by saying that she thought affidavits should be kept “short and sweet”.206Foot Note 206×Transcript of 6 October 2022 at p 132 ln 14 to p 133 n 19. 155 I do not find Ms Melissa’s evidence to be reliable. She has furnished justifications at every turn to fortify her narrative that she had been involved in managing the tenancy and maintenance of Berth. These justifications appear to be more of an afterthought to cover up weaknesses in her evidence. I hence do not find the evidence sufficient to suggest that Ms Melissa had dealt with Berth as an owner – the evidence, in fact, suggests that Berth was never meant to be a gift for Ms Melissa to manage, control or use as she wished. 156 Ms Melissa’s evidence about putting up Berth as security to discharge the Suit 111 Mareva Injunction is similarly not credible. In contradiction to Mdm Koh’s evidence that it was Mdm Koh or Dr Goh who had asked her to do this, Ms Melissa stated that she had offered the property without being asked: Q. Now, do you agree with Mdm Koh that it was either her or Dr Goh that asked you to offer up the property for the discharge of the Mareva? Do you agree with that? A. No. Q. And your evidence remains that it's just you offering of your own accord? A. Yes. If they asked me, I would have said \"no\". Q. Now, you offered it of your own accord, but if they asked you, you would have said \"no\"? A. Just to be spiteful. Q. Just to be spiteful? A. I offered it on my own accord.207Foot Note 207×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 136 ln 11 to ln 23. 157 She also stated that she did not recall that the subject of offering up Berth as security was discussed within the family.208Foot Note 208×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 137 ln 20 to ln 23.However, she did appear to suggest that some form of discussion regarding the injunction had taken place: A. No. They were facing a trade injunction back then, so they couldn't practice, so they couldn't make money. And then we needed, like, cashflow for living expenses. COURT: Yes. A. Yeah, so we needed to -- I think they said we needed to put up something so that they can practice. COURT: So there was some conversation about this? A. I can't remember exactly what the conversation was. COURT: But there was some conversation? A. Yeah.209Foot Note 209×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 139 ln 9 to ln 18. 158 Ms Melissa then explained that her position was that she had spontaneously offered to put up the Berth as security and that she knew that it was an option because she had heard about it from “other lawyer friends”.210Foot Note 210×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 141 ln 2 to ln 15.She also stated that she did not know whether Dr Jeremy, who had put up Seascape to discharge the same injunction at the same time, had done so on his own accord or been asked to do so.211Foot Note 211×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 141 ln 16 to ln 19. 159 In my view, Ms Melissa’s account of events surrounding the decision to put up Berth as security often appears to be either lacking in coherence or incomplete. If I were to take her words at face value, this appears to be a situation where: (a) She had been made privy to the difficulties her parents were facing due to the injunction, but no request had been made of her to assist. (b) She decided to assist by putting up Berth as security, yet her willingness to help without being asked would be negated out of spite should any request have been made of her. (c) Dr Jeremy had put up his own property as security for the same purpose at the same time, and yet she was not aware of how he had come to a decision to do so. 160 To believe Ms Melissa’s account of events, I would have also to believe that her decision to put up Berth as security is characterised by a confusing mix of altruism and caprice and that Dr Goh’s children have somehow managed to deal with their properties in a perfectly synchronised manner, without any coordination between any members of the family. 161 The untenability of Ms Melissa’s attempts to suggest that she did not know of any attempt to defraud creditors on her father’s part becomes clearer when she was cross-examined on the Elves Group Chat Message. She stated point-blank that Dr Michelle was lying when she said that Ms Melissa had been messaging their father about the ongoing lawsuit against him, as Dr Michelle “was just ranting nonsense and rubbish … to get our attention” and “likes to exaggerate to make a big deal out of things” because the siblings “[do not] give her attention”.212Foot Note 212×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 144 ln 17 to p145 ln 25; p 147 ln 1 to ln 8.Yet, Ms Melissa herself had responded in the Elves Group Chat, saying that “they are trying to sue [her] and [Mdm Koh] too”.213Foot Note 213×Transcript of 6 October 2022 p 146 ln 1 to ln 13.While Ms Melissa’s testimony is that she is uninvolved and ignorant of Dr Goh’s lawsuits and legal troubles to the point of callous disregard, this does not sit well with the evidence of her actions and her responses in the Elves Group Chat. The evidence instead reflects her recognition of Dr Goh and her family’s difficulties and her willingness to deal with Berth in ways that would alleviate these difficulties. 162 This is again evinced in the mortgaging of Berth for S$2.64m. Ms Melissa states that she had initiated the idea of mortgaging Berth as she wished to help the family with cash flow and living expenses. In contradiction to Dr Goh’s evidence that he had asked Ms Melissa to consider mortgaging Berth, Ms Melissa’s evidence is that Dr Goh had never spoken to her about mortgaging Berth.214Foot Note 214×Transcript of 7 October 2022 p 25 ln 24 to p 27 ln 7.While she acknowledged that Ms Denie had assisted her with the process of mortgaging Berth and acknowledged being part of the “Internal Party Property” chat group where Dr Goh had sent the Vultures Message and instructed her and Dr Jeremy to assist Ms Denie with the mortgage process,215Foot Note 215×Transcript of 7 October 2022 p 27 ln 15 to ln 24.she said she did not recall the group chat and did not read the messages in the group chat.216Foot Note 216×Transcript of 7 October 2022 p 28 ln 2 to p 29 ln 19.Ms Melissa also contradicted Dr Goh’s evidence that he had verbally talked to them before the message was sent on mortgaging the property by saying that she did not remember such a conversation and that her father “says a lot of nonsense” and she “[does not] listen half the time”.217Foot Note 217×Transcript of 7 October 2022 p 30 ln 2 to p 31 ln 17. 163 Again, Ms Melissa’s account of events appears contrived to exclude any possibility of her parents being involved in dealings surrounding Berth. I find it unconvincing that Ms Melissa should have been so thoroughly oblivious to her father’s direct communication to her of his intentions surrounding Berth and yet proceeded to do exactly as he wished after his communication was made. 164 The defendants’ position is that out of the S$2.64m in mortgage proceeds, S$600,000 was given to Mdm Koh, S$2m to Dr Michelle, and S$40,000 expended by Ms Melissa herself on personal living expenses. I do not think the evidence suffices to support Mdm Wang’s submission that Dr Goh was the beneficiary of the S$2m transferred to Dr Michelle.218Foot Note 218×PCS at para 153.In any event, the main point is that the evidence shows that Ms Melissa entered the mortgage on Dr Goh’s instructions, and much of the money was not for her benefit. Like her putting up Berth as security, her decisions were not made voluntarily as the true beneficial owner of the property. 165 In summary, I hence find that the beneficial interest in the Berth lies with Dr Goh and Mdm Koh by operation of the presumption of a resulting trust in their favour.",

        "Parties’ Submissions": "201 Counsel for Mdm Wang submits that the evidence showed that Dr Goh advanced loans to the yacht companies, and the novation of the loans in September 2017 was intended to divest his assets. The net effect of the novation was that Mdm Koh received more monies from the yacht companies than she had lent to them.273Foot Note 273×PCS at paras 163, 173–174.The plaintiff submits that Dr Goh was the driving force of the yacht companies and had been reflected as the lender in documentary evidence.274Foot Note 274×PCS at paras 164–169.Further, neither Dr Goh nor Mdm Koh could explain why a novation agreement was required to achieve their alleged purpose of correcting their internal accounts.275Foot Note 275×PCS at para 170. 202 Mdm Wang hence submits that the novation of the loans is voidable under s 73B of the CLPA, as Mdm Koh had paid no consideration for them, and the novation was not executed in good faith. She seeks for Mdm Koh to pay the sums of S$424,000 and S$2,815,000, which were paid to Mdm Koh by SYC and YMPH, respectively, into Dr Goh’s bankruptcy estate for the benefit of the creditors.276Foot Note 276×PCS at paras 176, 233– 234. 203 On the other hand, the defendants submit that Dr Goh wanted Mdm Koh to take over the management of the yacht companies and his shareholding in SYC as he was focused on various lawsuits. Moreover, Mdm Koh was the true lender of the monies, as all monies advanced to or on behalf of the yacht companies came from her joint bank accounts and single bank accounts. They submit that the yacht companies’ accounts had wrongly recorded the SYC’s loans as being from “Dr/Mrs Goh”, and YM loans as being from Dr Goh.277Foot Note 277×DCS at paras 252–254.Dr Goh and Mdm Koh hence entered into the novation as they, being laypersons, thought that it was the simplest and cheapest way to transfer responsibilities, rights and liabilities in the yacht companies to Mdm Koh.278Foot Note 278×DCS at para 254; DRS at para 201. 204 Further, the defendants submit that Dr Goh’s victories and amicable resolutions in various suits in 2017 also meant that Dr Goh did not expect himself to have any creditors as at September 2017 and that there is no positive material to show Dr Goh’s actual intention to defraud creditors.279Foot Note 279×DCS at paras 255–256; DRS at para 194.Mdm Wang has also not fulfilled her burden of showing what was Mdm Koh’s state of mind at the time of novation, and establishing that Mdm Koh had notice of any intention to defraud creditors when entering into the novation agreements.280Foot Note 280×DRS at para 203.",
        "My findings": "205 I am unconvinced by the defendants’ claim that the novation had been done to correct misstatements in the yacht companies’ internal records. Since much of the two loans were given from the OCBC 501 Account, and having found that the OCBC 501 Account is jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, it cannot be that this was a loan solely or mostly extended by Mdm Koh. 206 When on the stand, Dr Goh was asked why he only gave the reason that he had entered the novation agreement so that he could focus on the lawsuits during his bankruptcy proceedings but omitted to say that he was seeking to correct their internal records. Dr Goh simply answered that he “could be incomplete”.281Foot Note 281×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 90 ln 24 to p 91 ln 5.Neither was Mdm Koh able to explain why the loan ledger entries in the yacht companies’ internal accounts (which she sought to rely on) did not tally with the financial statements for 2015, 2016 and 2017, which she had signed.282Foot Note 282×Transcript of 29 September 2022 p 176 ln 24 to p 177 ln 8. 207 Essentially, we are faced with a situation where all other evidence flies in the face of Mdm Koh and Dr Goh’s suggestion that Mdm Koh is the true lender of the loans to the yacht companies. It is not enough for Mdm Koh and Dr Goh to assert blandly that the accounts belied the truth; in the absence of supporting evidence, I find that the loans were more likely than not extended by Dr Goh. 208 Further, it appears to me that this novation was made with the intent of defrauding Dr Goh’s creditors. It is inconsequential whether the suits were going well as of 2017. As early as 2016, Dr Goh had begun (as I have found above) the process of dissipating his assets. Given the untenability of Dr Goh’s claim that he was trying to correct the yacht companies’ accounts, it is more likely than not that his novation of the loans was done with the aim of defrauding creditors. 209 Furthermore, Mdm Koh had only provided S$1 in exchange for the novation of the loans. Also, as mentioned above, since she had well been aware of Dr Goh’s intention to defraud creditors prior to the novation and given the flimsiness of the claim that she is the true lender, I am of the view that she had notice of Dr Goh’s intent to defraud his creditors. 210 Similarly, even though Dr Goh and Mdm Koh claimed that he had transferred his shares in SYC to her as he was burdened by his ongoing lawsuits, there is no evidence to support this claim. During trial, Dr Goh began by calling SYC a mere “hobby business”, but went on to say just a few minutes afterwards that because the company had been managed by Mdm Koh, he was “not involved” or “even aware” of the loans made to SYC.283Foot Note 283×Transcript of 13 September 2022 p 49 ln 9 to ln 14.On the face of his evidence, neither characterisation of SYC suggests that he would need to transfer his shares so as to focus on his lawsuits. This business was either not a core business for Dr Goh that would distract him from his legal concerns, or not even a business which he had a hand in managing, despite being a significant shareholder. 211 Also, as highlighted during Dr Goh’s examination, Dr Goh’s two reasons for the novation of loans and transfer of shares (ie, to correct the accounts and because he wanted to focus on his lawsuits) do not cohere with each other. If all he had wanted was to have Mdm Koh be responsible for running SYC so that he could focus on his lawsuits, then it would be sufficient for him to transfer the shares to her and not also to novate the loans. If the issue was that the accounts were wrong, he did not have to give up responsibility for running SYC for them to be amended.284Foot Note 284×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 93 ln 22 to p 95 ln 8.If both reasons were separate ones that co-existed alongside each other, then that begets the question of why the reason that the accounts had to be corrected was brought up so late as to almost seem like an afterthought. 212 Given Dr Goh’s conduct of systematically dissipating his assets to his family members, and against the backdrop of their inconsistent and unconvincing evidence regarding the novation of the loans to the yacht companies to Mdm Koh, I find that the transfer of shares was for the purpose of defrauding Dr Goh’s creditors. The novation of the yacht companies’ loans is hence caught by s 73B of the CLPA.",
        "Whether Mdm Koh had notice of Dr Goh’s fraudulent intention": "194 It is undisputed that Mdm Koh knew the lawsuits were ongoing and that Dr Goh was under a lot of stress from these lawsuits. She, however, stated that he had never mentioned to her that he wished to move his assets.263Foot Note 263×Transcript of 16 September 2022 at p 128 ln 13 to p 129 ln 1.To the contrary, the evidence suggests that Mdm Koh knew all along that her husband was seeking to dissipate his assets through various means, and she has not been honest in her evidence in this regard. 195 For example, with respect to the mortgage of Berth, she said she only found out about the mortgage in 2020 after Dr Goh told his family about his bankruptcy. When asked why this incident was not stated on affidavit, she explained that she did not wish to wash dirty linen.264Foot Note 264×Transcript of 29 September 2022 p 56 ln 6 to ln 11.She was then shown her examination in Dr Goh’s bankruptcy proceedings265Foot Note 265×Agreed Bundle of Documents (Volume 12) (“12AB”) p 6994.where she had given evidence under oath about the mortgage of Berth back in January 2018, which she had discovered when she received letters addressed to Ms Melissa. Mdm Koh was unable to reconcile her inconsistent evidence and gave the ambiguous response that “for Melissa it was probably after – maybe before or after bankruptcy”.266Foot Note 266×Transcript of 29 September 2022 p 59 ln 19 to p 62 ln 18. 196 With respect to the mortgage of Seascape, her claim that she had only learnt of it after Dr Goh declared bankruptcy was also contradicted by her evidence in the bankruptcy proceedings,267Foot Note 267×12AB p 7006.during which she clearly said she found out about the mortgage from Dr Goh or Dr Jeremy at the time. When confronted with her evidence in the bankruptcy proceedings, Mdm Koh was evasive in her responses, insisting that her answers were given in November 2021 – but this was irrelevant to the fact that she appeared to have known about the Seascape mortgage before 2020.268Foot Note 268×Transcript of 29 September 2022 p 62 ln 7 to p 67 ln 6. 197 Mdm Koh’s knowledge of Dr Goh’s intent to divert his assets to his family is also evinced through the sale of Dr Goh’s cars. Dr Goh claimed that he had sold two of his cars in November 2019 before he had gone bankrupt, to raise money for gambling.269Foot Note 269×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 80 ln 15 to p 81 ln 4.During the same period, Mdm Koh bought two cars, which, like Dr Goh’s cars previously, were open to usage by members of the family, including Dr Goh.270Foot Note 270×Transcript of 8 September 2022 at p 81 ln 21 to p 82 ln 9.Dr Goh’s evidence was that no questions were raised by Mdm Koh about his sale of the cars and that she simply went ahead to buy two cars in the same time frame. Additionally, it would be quite obvious that he had sold two cars and she required two more cars for family usage, so Mdm Koh did not give any reason for her purchase.271Foot Note 271×Transcript of 8 September 2022 p 86 ln 25 to p 88 ln 14. 198 Mdm Koh’s explanation was that Dr Goh’s cars were “petrol-guzzlers” and were reaching five years old, at which point they would normally change cars. However, she was asked why she could not directly use the sales proceeds of Dr Goh’s two cars to buy the two new cars. To this, Mdm Koh said that it was because she was paying for the new cars and Dr Goh did not wish to.272Foot Note 272×Transcript of 5 October 2022 p 128 ln 3 to ln 16. 199 If Dr Goh’s account is to be relied on, it makes no sense why Mdm Koh would have replaced his cars without seeking any clarification as to why he had sold them. If Mdm Koh’s account is to be relied on, it makes no sense why Dr Goh would sell his cars, and she buys new cars separately. 200 Taking the evidence in its totality – that Mdm Koh had knowledge of Dr Goh’s legal pressures, that Mdm Koh knew of the Berth and Seascape transactions which occurred years before the sale of 36 Cove Way (and is attempting to conceal that knowledge from this Court), and also given her suspicious conduct with regard to the family cars soon after the sale of 36 Cove Way, I find it more likely than not that Mdm Koh had notice of Dr Goh’s intention to defraud his creditors through the sale of his share in 36 Cove Way.",
        "Issue 4: The yacht companies’ transactions": "",
        "Summary of findings": "213 For the foregoing reasons, I find that the following transactions are voidable under s 73B of the CLPA: (a) the conveyance of the OCBC 582 Monies to Dr Jeremy; (b) the purchase of Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name; (c) the sale of Dr Goh’s half-share in 36 Cove Way to Mdm Koh; and (d) Dr Goh’s novation of loans to the yacht companies to Mdm Koh. 214 I also find that the beneficial interest of Berth lies with Dr Goh and Mdm Koh by operation of the presumption of resulting trust. 215 The conveyance of S$1,873,320.63 of the OCBC 582 Monies as well as the purchases of Seascape and Berth were done with monies from the OCBC 501 Account, which I have found to be jointly owned by Mdm Koh and Dr Goh.",
        "Reliefs granted": "216 I hence make the following orders. 36 Cove Way 217 For 36 Cove Way, I grant a declaration that the transfer of Dr Goh’s joint interest in 36 Cove Way to Mdm Koh on 12 April 2019 is void and of no effect, pursuant to s 73B of the CLPA, such that Dr Goh remains the joint interest owner of 36 Cove Way. Dr Goh is therefore liable to refund to Mdm Koh the sum of S$5.25m paid by Mdm Koh to him. OCBC 582 Monies 218 For the monies in the OCBC 582 Account, I grant a declaration that the transfer of monies of S$1,873,320.63 into that OCBC account (which is in Dr Jeremy’s name) is void and of no effect pursuant to s 73B of the CLPA, and make an order that Dr Jeremy, within seven days from the date of this judgment, pay over monies in the OCBC 582 Account to the Official Assignee. 219 I also grant a declaration that if any of the monies in the OCBC 582 Account had been used to purchase any asset or is transferred to any other bank accounts, that these assets and/or monies in the relevant bank accounts are to be transferred to the Official Assignee. Berth and Seascape (1) Whether property purchases from a joint account are exigible 220 Counsel for the defendants rely onTiming Ltd v TayToh Hin and another[2021] 4 SLR 1040 (“Timing 2021”) andTiming Ltd v TayToh Hin and another[2020] 5 SLR 974 (“Timing 2020”) to suggest that monies in the OCBC 501 Account would have been exigible only if the monies belong solely to the debtor.285Foot Note 285×DCS at para 158.As such, the defendants’ position is that insofar as Mdm Koh has a joint interest in the OCBC 501 Account, this poses a hindrance to Mdm Wang’s claim against Berth and Seascape. To this, counsel for Mdm Wang says that this proposition is only limited to garnishee proceedings.286Foot Note 286×PRS at para 72. 221 With respect to counsel, I do not think that the defendants’ submission was the proposition being forwarded in the two cited authorities. Those authorities were concerned with the narrower issue of whether the court should allow joint bank accounts to be garnished. In any event, the position in Singapore law on garnishing joint accounts has not yet been settled. On one hand, these two cases take the position that joint accounts may be garnished if there is strongprimafacieevidence that the money therein belongs to the judgment debtor, with Aedit Abdullah J commenting inTiming 2020(at [24]) that: … To hold otherwise would permit debtors to insulate their assets by holding them in joint accounts, and would result in an arbitrary position where the recoverability of a judgment debt depended in large part on the manner in which the debtor had decided to organise his personal finances. Such a position would unduly undermine the position of judgment creditors, and would permit judgment debtors to, fortuitously or otherwise, frustrate the rulings of a court. 222 However, inOne Investment and Consultancy Ltd and another v ChamPoh Meng (DBS Bank Ltd,garnishee) [2016] 5 SLR 923 (“One Investment”), Kannan Ramesh JC (as he then was) took the opposing position that joint accounts cannot be garnished as “a bank has no visibility as to the respective contributions of the joint account holders” and is ill-suited to conduct a determination of parties’ respective contributions. The garnishing of joint accounts may also cause banks to incur operational and legal costs in notifying joint account owners and responding to their complaints, whereas the garnishee process is supposed to be fairly uncomplicated (at [16] and [19]). 223 I make two observations on counsel’s application of these two cases. The first is to reiterate that the state of law on garnishing orders with respect to joint accounts is simply not relevant to the present case. This can be seen from how the court inOne Investmenthas centred much of its reasoning around the nature and purpose of the garnishing process, such as the implications that garnishing of joint accounts would hold for banks. 224 The second is that even inTiming 2020, the question of whether the account should be garnished is still ultimately premised on the question of whether the monies in the joint account belong to the judgment debtor. Similarly,Timing 2021concerns a garnishing application by the appellant with respect to two of the respondent’s accounts with Standard Chartered Bank, which were in joint name with the respondent’s wife (Timing 2021at [1]). The court held that the evidence did not suffice to establish on a balance of probabilities that all the monies in the joint accounts belonged beneficially to the respondent: at [31]). 225 Turning back to our present case, the evidence does not show that Mdm Koh had no beneficial interest in the monies in the joint account in the first place. She may not have stopped Dr Goh from using the monies in the OCBC 582 Account, but nothing suggests that she too could not access the monies. She, too, had contributed monies to the account. Moreover, as established earlier, she was also involved in the purchase of Berth and Seascape using the monies. I hence do not think the finding that the OCBC 582 Monies are jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh places any obstacles to the reliefs sought by Mdm Wang. (2) Severance of joint beneficial interest in Berth and Seascape 226 Counsel for Mdm Wang submits that as Berth and Seascape were bought with monies jointly owned by Dr Goh and Mdm Koh, and given that Mdm Wang is seeking an order for the sale of these two properties, the Court should sever the joint tenancy in the properties and apportion 80% to Dr Goh and 20% to Mdm Koh.287Foot Note 287×PRS at paras 73–74.The basis on which counsel for Mdm Wang submits for an 80-20 apportionment is because Dr Goh contributed more of the monies in the OCBC 501 Account. 227 However, it appears that Dr Goh and Mdm Koh had approached the monies in the OCBC 501 Account as a common pool between them regardless of their respective contributions. I am therefore of the view that an even split of 50% of the interest in the properties to Dr Goh and Mdm Koh would be more appropriate. (3) Reliefs granted 228 For Berth, I grant a declaration that Ms Melissa holds Berth on trust for both Dr Goh and Mdm Koh. I also order that Ms Melissa sell Berth within three months and account for and pay 50% ofthe monies from this sale to the Official Assignee. 229 For Seascape, I grant a declaration that the purchase of or transfer of monies for the purchase of Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name is void and of no effect pursuant to s 73B of the CLPA. I also order that Dr Jeremy sell Seascape within three months and account for and pay 50% ofthe monies from this sale to the Official Assignee. Yacht loans and shares in the yacht companies 230 I grant the declaration that Dr Goh’s novation of the loans to SYC and YMC and disposal of the SYC shares are void and of no effect pursuant to s 73B of the CLPA.",
        "Conclusion": "231 For the foregoing reasons, I hence find that the transfer of monies from the OCBC 501 Account into the OCBC 582 Account, the purchase of Seascape in Dr Jeremy’s name, the sale of Dr Goh’s half-share in 36 Cove Way and the novation of loans to the yacht companies and transfer of SYC shares to Mdm Koh, are all conveyances which were carried out with an intent to defraud Dr Goh’s creditors and are voidablepers 73B of the CLPA. Additionally, the presumption of resulting trust arises with respect to Berth in Dr Goh and Mdm Koh’s favour. 232 Parties have liberty to apply for any orders that are necessitated by the declarations and orders I have made. I will thereafter hear parties on costs.
