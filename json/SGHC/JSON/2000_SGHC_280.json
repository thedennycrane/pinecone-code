When I went back to PIE, I was caught.(Numbering added)7. The officer who acted as the Hokkien interpreter during the\n\nrecording of this statement, Cpl Gabriel Ong Kok Leng conceded that the sixth answer could\n\nbe to visit, travel, sightsee or shop, and the eighth answer should be he was going to\n\nEunos, not going back to Eunos.8. The first accused also made a cautioned statement thatI cannot understand why I am being charged. Three names mentioned in\n\n  this charge, I only know Yau Hock Seng. I came to Singapore with him to visit. I took him\n\n  to the coffee shop in Bukit Panjang to have a cup of coffee. The owner of the coffee shop\n\n  can recognise me as I am a regular customer. After that, we went to Joo Chiat coffee shop\n\n  for something to eat. And then I drove my car to Thomson Road with my friend. At Thomson\n\n  Road, a friend called my handphone from Malaysia and asked to borrow my brother’s\n\n  car. Because the key was with me, I tried to head back to Malaysia. At Thomson Road, my\n\n  friend and I were arrested. I have nothing more to say because I do not know how to\n\n  explain.",
        "The second accused’s statements": "9. Two statements made by the second accused were also admitted in\n\nevidence without objection. The first was an investigation statement recorded on 5 January\n\n-1 Q: What time did you come to Singapore today?A: 9.10 a.m.2 Q: How you came to Singapore?A: My friend fetched me here in the car.3 Q: What is your friend’s name?A: I don’t know his name.

So we were going back to Malaysia. That was when we were caught.(Numbering added)Sgt Lee Keng Hiang who acted as the interpreter in the recording of\n\nthis statement conceded that the seventh answer could also be to go visiting or\n\nsightseeing.10. The other statement was a cautioned statement recorded after the\n\ninvestigation statement on the same day in which the second accused saidI did not give any heroin to any person.11. Motor car SBQ 3367J made its way to Onan Road where it came to a\n\nstop outside 253A, a two-storey house at about 10.55 am. SSgt Lim Jit Tong who was\n\ndeployed to keep surveillance on the house saw the third accused get out of the car and\n\nwent into the house empty-handed. A few minutes later he came out of the house and went\n\nback to his car. He took a white carrier bag from the car and went back to the house with\n\nit. Subsequently he returned empty-handed to the car and drove off.12. The third accused was eventually arrested at about 11.25 am at the\n\njunction of Clementi Avenue 6 and Jalan Lempeng by CNB officers who intercepted his car.\n\nWhen he was searched, a bunch of two keys and other items were recovered from his left\n\ntrousers pocket. Senior Staff Sgt Ang Oon Tho questioned the third accused in the car at\n\nthe scene of arrest. The questions and answers were recorded by the sergeant and signed by\n\nthe third accused. The statement which was admitted without objection, readsQ1: ‘Tow Seng Ti Toh Lok Lai?’(Where did you come from?)A1: ‘Johor’(Johor)Q2: ‘Chin Nung Kee Soh See Ti Toh Lok Eh?’ (I show accused\n\n  Gue Huay Quee a bunch of two keys seized from his left trousers pocket earlier)(Where this two keys belongs to?)A2: ‘Johor Long Tow’(Factory at Johor)Q3: ‘Chia Teng Woo Tok Ping Boh?’(Is there any drugs in your car)A3: ‘Noh’.(No).13. The third accused was taken from the scene of arrest back to 253A\n\nOnan Road. The CNB officers conducted a raid on 253A Onan Road in the presence of the\n\naccused. They gained entry into his rented room on the ground floor of the premises with\n\none of the keys seized from him. The officers seized a carrier bag on a study table in the\n\nbedroom. The bag is predominantly white in colour with a logo and the words \"Super\n\nMobile\" printed in blue and grey, and blue and grey panels along the sides. SSSgt Ang\n\nOon Tho and Sgt Henry Chong Wee Loong gave evidence that after they entered the room when\n\nSSSgt Ang asked the third accused where the drugs were, he pointed with his chin to the\n\ntable where the bag was on. Inside the bag were three packets of granular substance which\n\nform the subject matter of the joint charge against the accused persons. Other drugs and\n\ndrug trafficking paraphernalia were recovered from the bedroom and other parts of the\n\nhouse which are not related to the charge.14. He was questioned by SSSgt Ang again in the room. The third accused\n\ndisputed the admissibility of this statement as well as four investigation statements\n\nwhich the investigation officer Inspector Saherly bin Limat recorded from him on 10, 13\n\nand 24 January and 15 February.15. A joint trial-within-a-trial was conducted to determine the\n\nadmissibility of these five statements.",
        "Trial-within-a-trial": "16. SSSgt Ang questioned the third accused in Hokkien when they were in\n\nthe bedroom and the third accused answered him in Hokkien and recorded the questions and\n\nanswers in his pocket book as that happened. After that he read them back to the third\n\naccused, then the statement was signed by the third accused.17. After that statement was recorded and signed, when officers had\n\nsearched the bedroom, he asked the third accused whether there were any more drugs in the\n\nbedroom, and the third accused replied in the negative.18. Mr Dhillon, counsel for the third accused put to the sergeant that\n\nhe was very aggressive and high-handed towards the third accused when he recorded the\n\nstatement. He also put to him that he agreed to let him smoke a cigarette if he signed the\n\nstatement. The sergeant denied these allegations.19. When the third accused gave evidence on the recording of his\n\nstatement, he said that some of the answers recorded by the sergeant were not his answers.\n\nHe signed the statement because the sergeant threatened to hit him on his stomach if he\n\nrefused to sign, and because he was told that he could have a drink and a cigarette after\n\nhe signed. He added that the drink and cigarette were given to him by Sgt Henry Chong Wee\n\nLoong after the statement was signed. He said that he would not have signed the statement\n\nif the threat and inducement were not made.20. Under cross-examination by the prosecutor, he said that he signed\n\nthe statement because the sergeant threatened to beat him if he did not, and also told him\n\nthat he should sign because the statement would serve as a record, and that he should not\n\nbe afraid if the things did not belong to him. In answer to another question he confirmed\n\nthat he would not have signed the statement on the offer of a cigarette.21. The prosecutor pointed out to him that it was not put to SSSgt Ang\n\nthat he had threatened to hit him on his stomach, or that he offered to give him a drink\n\nif he signed the statement. The prosecutor asked him for an explanation why that was not\n\nput, but did not receive any.22. Inspector Saherly recorded the first three statements from the\n\nthird accused on 10, 13 and 24 January in his office. The last statement was taken on 15\n\nFebruary at the Queenstown Remand Centre. Mr Wu Nan Yong acted as the Hokkien interpreter\n\nfor the first two statements and Ms Ong Lee Eng was the Hokkien interpreter for the last\n\ntwo statements.23. Mr Dhillon cross-examined the inspector at some length. He\n\nestablished from the inspector that a cautioned statement was recorded on 5 January in\n\nwhich the third accused said \"I am confused and I do not know what to say.\"\n\nCounsel then put to the inspector that he was very angry with the third accused when the\n\nstatement was recorded and he warned him to co-operate or he will face the death penalty\n\nand told him that he will give him a few days to think before another statement will be\n\nrecorded, and advised him to admit his involvement.24. Counsel also put to the inspector that during the recording of the\n\nstatement of 10 January, he told the third accused that if he did not co-operate he could\n\nface a very severe punishment, and if he did not admit to the carrier bag in his bedroom\n\nhe will be charged with all the drugs found in the house. Counsel added that during the\n\nrecording the inspector suggested to the third accused that he placed the bag on the table\n\nand locked the room, but the third accused remained silent. When the statement was\n\ncompleted and read back the third accused looked at him in amazement, but he stared at the\n\nthird accused, who remained silent after that.25. On the recording of the second statement of 13 January, counsel put\n\nto the inspector that he repeated the warning that if he did not co-operate he will be\n\ncharged with all the drugs recovered from the premises. On 24 January when the statement\n\nwas recorded, although the accused said \"white paper bag\", but it became\n\n\"white paper bag with blue wordings\" when the statement was read back to him.\n\nThe third accused looked at him when the statement was read back, but he stared at him,\n\nand the third accused remained silent.26. During the recording of the last statement on 15 February the third\n\naccused was again unhappy with the statement when it was read back to him. He looked at\n\nthe inspector but remained silent because the inspector stared at him. The inspector\n\ndenied all these allegations.27. Mr Wu Nan Yong gave evidence relating to the recording of the\n\nstatements of 10 and 13 January. He interpreted everything that the accused said in\n\nHokkien into English to Inspector Saherly, and affirmed that no inducement, threat or\n\npromise was offered by Inspector Saherly or himself. In cross-examination, he said that he\n\nlooked at the accused when he read back the statement to him. However, it was not put to\n\nMr Wu that the third accused had looked at the inspector, and remained silent after the\n\ninspector glared at him.28. Ms Ong Lee Eng’s evidence on the recording of the statements\n\nof 24 January and 15 February was that no inducement or threat or promise was made during\n\nthe recording of the statements. Mr Dhillon asked her about the third accused looking at\n\nthe inspector and the latter staring at him but she did not notice or remember that.29. The third accused gave his account on the recording of the four\n\ninvestigation statements. In relation to the first statement of 10 January, his evidence\n\nwas that before the recording commenced the inspector told him to co-operate, lest he\n\nwould be in trouble and face capital punishment. When the statement was read back to him,\n\nhe told the inspector it was not what he had said, but the inspector stared at him and he\n\nremained silent after that.30. Before the recording of the statement of 13 January, the inspector\n\nasked him again to co-operate and told him that if he did not co-operate, he will be\n\ncharged with all the drugs found in the house. He was frightened and shocked when he heard\n\nthat, and was afraid that the inspector would frame him, so he decided to co-operate and\n\ndid not object to what the inspector wrote. However when the prosecutor questioned him he\n\nsaid he wanted to make some amendments to the statement recorded, and the inspector told\n\nthe interpreter to let him make the amendments.31. On 24 January when his statement was recorded, the inspector again\n\nasked him to co-operate or he would face the capital punishment. When the statement was\n\ncompleted and read back to him, he realized that portions thereof were not his words. He\n\nwanted to amend them, but the inspector reminded him to co-operate. He contradicted\n\nhimself on this point by saying that he did not express any desire to amend the statement,\n\nand had told the inspector he could write what he did.32. After hearing the third accused and all the witnesses in thevoir\n\ndire, I ruled that the statements in question were voluntary statements. The\n\nallegations made by the third accused and his counsel were inconsistent and contradictory.33. When SSSgt Ang gave evidence, Mr Dhillon accused him of being\n\naggressive and high-handed and alleged that he had offered to let the third accused smoke\n\na cigarette if he signed the statement. When the third accused gave evidence himself, the\n\nsergeant’s alleged wrong-doings grew. He alleged that the sergeant threatened to hit\n\nhim on the stomach, assured him that the statement was just a draft or a record in which\n\nhis answers were recorded as \"I do not know\" or \"I am not sure\", and\n\noffered him a drink as well as a cigarette if he signed. The common complaint that was put\n\nby Mr Dhillon and mentioned by the third accused was the offer of a cigarette. That was\n\ndenied by SSSgt Ang and Sgt Henry Chong Wee Loong who was alleged to have handed him the\n\ncigarette.34. With regard to the first three statements recorded by Inspector\n\nSaherly, Mr Dhillon put to the inspector that when each statement was read to the accused,\n\nhe stared at the third accused and caused him to sign the statement in silence. That\n\ndiffered from the third accused’s own evidence that he asked to amend those three\n\nstatements, and was not intimidated into silent submission.35. I did not believe the third accused’s evidence and found that\n\nhe had not raised any reasonable doubt that the statements were made voluntarily. I\n\ntherefore admitted the statements in evidence.36. The statement recorded by SSSgt Ang readsUpon entering the bedroom, I questioned the accused Gue Huay Quee some\n\n  questions in the Hokkien dialect and accused Gue Huay Quee answered in the Hokkien\n\n  dialect. The following were the questions and answers that were recorded in my pocket\n\n  book:Q1: ‘Pang Keng Lai Bin Woo Mee Kia Boh?’(Is there any drugs inside the room)A1: ‘Woo’.(Yes)Q2: ‘Woo See Mee’(What’s that)A2: ‘Peh Hoon’(Heroin)Q3: ‘Woo Lua Chuek Pek Hoon’(How much heroin are there)A3: ‘Woo Neng Sar Liap’(Two to three packets)Q4: ‘Pek Hoon See Siang Eh’(These heroin belong to whom)A4: ‘Ai Giah Hor Lang Eh’(Wanted to hand over to somebody)Q5: ‘See Siang’(To who)A5: ‘Wah Beh Cheng Cho’(I’m not sure)The above questions and answers were read to accused Gue Huay Quee in\n\n  the Hokkien dialect after they were recorded. He affirmed it to be true and correct. He\n\n  was invited to make any correction or alteration, but he declined the offer. Accused Gue\n\n  Huay Quee then signed on my pocket book. After that, I also appended my signature.37. The statement of 10 January recorded by inspector Saherly readsI am known as ‘Ah Quee’, ‘Pui Kia’ or ‘Ang\n\n  Moh’ to my friends. I am a partner of the above mentioned company dealing in timber.\n\n  My partner is Lim Gek San. I have been working there for about two years. My company is in\n\n  Malaysia and I stay in Singapore. I travel to Malaysia about 5 to 6 days in a week. I\n\n  normally drive my car, SBQ 3367 J.2. On 4.1.2000 at about 8.00 pm I drove into Malaysia. On the way\n\n  there, I went to a moneychanger to buy about RM$7500 using my own Singapore currency. I\n\n  reached my workplace at about 11.00 pm. I then went to the workers’ quarters and gave\n\n  my foreman RM$1200 for my workers’ advance pay for the coming Hari Raya. I then left\n\n  my factory. As I left my factory, one ‘Ah Hou’ paged for me. I then called him\n\n  at 020196513286. He asked me to meet him at a restaurant in Senai. When we met, he said\n\n  that there is something for him to do tomorrow and asked me whether I want to do it. The\n\n  thing that he wanted me to do is for him to pass something to me. The something is\n\n  actually ‘Pei Hoon’. He did not tell me exactly what it is but I know because we\n\n  have done this a few times before. At first, I did not want to do it but he scolded me and\n\n  I agreed after that. I then asked him to call me tomorrow morning before he enters\n\n  Singapore. I am shown a photo of a male Chinese and I recognise the person as ‘Ah\n\n  Hou’. (Recorder’s note: Ah Hou is one Kum Mun Hou, M/24, Malaysian IC No:\n\n  760902-05-5257). I then went to meet my girlfriend. I sent her home at about 2.00 am on\n\n  5.1.2000. I then checked into Lion City Hotel and spend the night there.3 On 5.1.2000 at about 10.00 am, ‘Ah Hou’ paged me again.\n\n  When I called him, he told me that he is already in Singapore. I then said that I am still\n\n  in Johor Bahru. He then told me to meet him at a Shell petrol station near Joo Chiat\n\n  Police Post. At around 11.00 am I reached the petrol station but I could not see Ah Hou. I\n\n  then called his handphone and we arrange to meet at an Esso petrol station nearby. At the\n\n  Esso petrol station, I stopped my car along the exit road of the station. Ah Hou then\n\n  drove up and stopped his car next to mine. A young boy seated on the front passenger seat\n\n  then opened the car door and I lowered my window. The boy then passed me a white paper bag\n\n  with blue wordings. They then drove off. I am shown a photo of a male Chinese and I\n\n  recognised the person as the small boy. I do not know his name as this is the first time I\n\n  saw him. (Recorder’s note: The small boy is one Yau Hock Seng, M/19, Malaysian IC No:\n\n  811113-05-5657) I then went to 253A, Onan Road. I entered the house and went to a room on\n\n  the ground floor. I then placed the bag on a table and locked the room before leaving.4 I then wanted to drive to Bukit Batok to meet my sawmill partner. At\n\n  the junction of Jalan Lempeng and Clementi Ave 6, I was arrested by a group of people who\n\n  identified themselves as government men.38. The statement of 13 January reads5 My previous statement was read back and explained to me in Hokkien by\n\n  the interpreter. I do not wish to make any corrections.6 I rented the room at 253A Onan Road about one year ago from someone\n\n  whom I called ‘Er Lang’. I pay a monthly rental of S$500 cash to ‘Er\n\n  Lang’. I met ‘Er Lang’ during one of my visits to his Karaoke Lounge a few\n\n  years ago to entertain my friends. I only stay in the room occasionally as I am staying\n\n  with my mother at the Whampoa flat. I let my friends who just came in from Malaysia to\n\n  stay in the room while they find their own accommodation. I do not know the other tenants\n\n  staying in the house. I also do not know much about ‘Er Lang’ and his\n\n  girlfriend. When I rented the room, ‘Er Lang’ gave me two keys, one for the main\n\n  door and one for my room. I made two sets of duplicate keys to give to my friends who used\n\n  to stay in the room. One set was given to a Vietnamese lady but she had already left\n\n  Singapore to return to Vietnam. I forgot to get the set of keys from her when I sent her\n\n  to the airport to see her off. The other set was left in the room.7 In October 1999, I was in financial difficulties. I met a Malaysian\n\n  Chinese whom I called ‘Ah Boy’ at a night club in Johor Bahru. I told him that I\n\n  needed some fast money. He said that he will take care of it and took down my handphone\n\n  number. He told me to pass something to someone in Singapore. I could sense that it was\n\n  something illegal. Some days later, ‘Ah Boy’ had called me on my handphone and\n\n  asked me to make a spare key and leave the key in the room. He also gave me instructions\n\n  to leave the main door and the room door unlocked so that someone could come and collect\n\n  the set of keys. I do not know who took the key. A few days later, ‘Ah Boy’\n\n  called again and told me to be on standby in Singapore. I was then told to park my vehicle\n\n  at near the Joo Chiat Food Centre. I did as I was told. Someone then came and park his car\n\n  beside mine. The driver then said to me in Mandarin, \"Friend, working one.\" He\n\n  would then pass me a plastic bag. Out of curiosity, I opened the bag and saw one packet of\n\n  yellow substance wrapped in few layers of plastic. I knew that the yellow substance was\n\n  ‘Pei Hoon’ from my understanding from friends and news media and also from the\n\n  big payment that I was promised for doing the job. I then drove to 253A, Onan Road and\n\n  placed the bag on a table in the rented room. I then left the room and locked it up. The\n\n  next day, ‘Ah Boy’ called me again to inform me to collect my payment from the\n\n  rented room. I then went to the room and collected my first payment of S$500.8 I have done this for about six to seven times including the day I was\n\n  arrested. The number of packets of ‘Pei Hoon’ varies from one to two packets\n\n  each time. The day I was arrested was the first time that I had received three packets of\n\n  ‘Pei Hoon\". Since I gave a set of keys to ‘Ah Boy’, I did not stay in\n\n  the room or check the things in the room. I only went to the room to put the ‘Pei\n\n  Hoon’ and to collect my payment. I do not know anything about the other tablets found\n\n  in my room. I also do not have any knowledge about the drugs found in the cabinet in the\n\n  living room. I do not consume any drugs. I am also not aware of the items which were\n\n  recovered from the cupboard.39. The relevant parts of the statement of 24 January are14 When I returned called to Ah Hou on 5.1.2000 morning, he told me\n\n  that he was already in Singapore. I was surprised because he did not called me earlier and\n\n  that I would need at least one hour to reach Joo Chiat to meet him. He then answered that\n\n  he can wait. I reached the hawker centre opposite the Joo Chiat Police Post at about 11.00\n\n  am but I could not find him. I then called Ah Hou at the same handphone number mentioned\n\n  in Para 2. I asked him where he was and he answered that he was nearby. I then proceeded\n\n  to make a turn and saw Ah Hou in a car with a Malaysian plate. Ah Hou was driving and\n\n  there was a small boy sitting beside him. I then turned and stopped in front of a Shell\n\n  station and waited for Ah Hou to stop his car behind mine. After that I started to move\n\n  off and Ah Hou followed behind.15 I then drove until I reached an Esso petrol station. I entered the\n\n  station and Ah Hou followed. I then parked my car near the air pump and came out of my car\n\n  to pump my tyre. Ah Hou stopped his car on the right side of mine. He then came out and\n\n  went into the toilet. After I finished pumping my tyre, I went into the toilet. Ah Hou was\n\n  inside and we spoke. I told him that there is no one around. Ah Hou mentioned further up.\n\n  I then agreed. We then left the toilet and entered our cars. I then drove out very slowly\n\n  along a small slip road. Ah Hou then drove from behind and stopped beside my car, blocking\n\n  it slightly. The small boy sitting in the front passenger seat then opened the car door\n\n  and passed a white paper bag with blue wordings onto my lap. I then took the bag and\n\n  placed it on the front passenger seat. We then left in separate ways. I then drove to\n\n  253A, Onan Road to place the bag in my rented room on the ground floor.40. The statement of 5 February did not add significantly to the\n\nprevious statements, and need not be set out here.",
        "Close of the prosecution case": "41. At the close of the prosecution case I reviewed the evidence\n\nagainst the accused persons. The third accused had in the statement to SSSgt Ang made in\n\nthe bedroom admitted his knowledge and involvement with the drugs recovered. In his\n\ninvestigation statements to Inspector Saherly he explained the drugs came into his\n\npossession. His account clearly implicated himself, the first accused Kum Mun Hou who he\n\nsaid had arranged the delivery, and to a lesser extent the second accused Yau Hock Seng\n\nwho was with him when the drugs were transferred and who physically handed the drugs over.\n\nI therefore called all three of them to enter their defences.",
        "Defence of the first accused": "42. The first accused is 24 years old. He has attended school up to\n\nForm 5 (equivalent to the \"O\" level in Singapore) and had taken courses in\n\nbusiness management and fashion design after that. His home town is Bahau, Negri Sembilan,\n\nbut he was residing in Johor Bahau at the time of his arrest. He was employed in the\n\nrunning of video arcades in Johor Bahru since May 1999, and was staying in a rented room.\n\nHe has known the second accused Yau Hock Seng who is also from Bahau, for more than two\n\nyears. They were very good friends and were working for the same employer and sharing the\n\nrented room at the time of their arrest.43. He became acquainted with the third accused in August 1999. The\n\nthird accused had told him that he was engaged in rearing fishes and that he has a sawmill\n\nin Senai. On 21 December 1999 the third accused told him that his sawmill was due to open\n\non 22 December and needed some timber. He arranged for the third accused to get the timber\n\nfrom his cousin who was in the timber business.44. He gave an account of his activities and visits to Singapore on the\n\ndays before his arrest. On the evening of 1 January, he and the second accused had visited\n\nSingapore in his brother’s car between 7 pm and 9 pm. On 3 January his employer told\n\nhim that he did not have to work for a few days because the police were raiding video\n\narcades.45. On 4 January at about 9 am, he came to Singapore again with the\n\nsecond accused to look for a friend in Boon Lay. They met up with the friend at a coffee\n\nshop at Boon Lay, and returned to Johor Bahru at about 11 am. At about 6.39 pm, he paged\n\nfor the third accused. He wanted to know if the third accused was in Singapore, and if he\n\nwas, he wanted to look him up. At about 7 pm he entered Singapore again by himself to look\n\nfor a friend. At about 7.51 pm he received a call from the third accused on his mobile\n\nphone. He asked the third accused whether he was in Singapore and if he could look him up.\n\nThe third accused told him he was busy and told him to page him again at 10 pm. He\n\nreturned to Johor to his rented room at about 9 pm and paged for the third accused at\n\nabout 10 pm. The third accused returned his call and requested him to go to Singapore the\n\nnext morning as he had something to discuss with him. The third accused told him to meet\n\nhim at Joo Chiat, but did not say what he intended to discuss.46. On 5 January he woke up at about 8 am and at about 8.30 am he left\n\nthe house with the second accused in motor car JCV 4973 which belonged to a friend called\n\nAh Loke. After entering Singapore, they had breakfast in a coffee shop in Bukit Panjang.\n\nAt about 9.30 am they set off for Joo Chiat. They went to a Shell petrol station where he\n\nparked the car, and they went to a coffee shop across the road, and he paged for the third\n\naccused. The third accused returned his call and said he would be slightly late. He went\n\nback to the petrol station, where he used the toilet and bought some toll coupons. Then he\n\ndrove around the vicinity with the second accused. Eventually he saw the third\n\naccused’s car near the junction of Dunman Road and Joo Chiat Road, travelling in the\n\nopposite direction to him. He made a U-turn and drove towards the third accused’s\n\ncar. The third accused gestured for him to follow and he followed the third accused’s\n\ncar to a Esso petrol station along Still Road.47. At the Esso petrol station the third accused stopped his car,\n\nalighted and pumped the tyres. He also left his car and went to the toilet behind the\n\npetrol station. The third accused followed him there and told him he had something to do\n\nand was not free to talk, and proposed that they meet in Johor that night, and he agreed.48. After that exchange they went back to their cars and drove away\n\nfrom the petrol station. While they were travelling along the side road, the third accused\n\nstopped his car and wound down the window and he too stopped his car next to it. The\n\nsecond accused opened the car door, and the third accused said to him (the first accused)\n\nto meet that night. After that the second accused closed the car door, and they both drove\n\noff.49. He had intended to go to Sin Ming to meet a friend. While he was\n\ndriving along Thomson Road his mobile phone rang and he answered the call from Ah Loke. Ah\n\nLoke wanted to borrow his brother’s car. As the keys to the car were with him, he\n\ndecided to return to Johor instead of visiting his friend in Sin Ming.50. Mr Goswami, counsel for the second accused, put to him that when\n\nthe two cars stopped abreast along the side road, he told the second accused to reach\n\nunder his seat to take out a bag and hand it to the man in the other car. The first\n\naccused denied this.51. Counsel then put to him that it did not make sense for the third\n\naccused to arrange to meet him, and then keep the appointment only to say he did not have\n\ntime and that they were to talk that night when he could have telephoned him to reschedule\n\nthe meeting.52. Under cross-examination by Mr Dhillon, the first accused confirmed\n\nthat the second accused did not know the third accused.53. The prosecutor asked him about his reaction when the third accused\n\ntold him at the Esso petrol station about the postponed discussion. He said he was not\n\nangry or upset over that, and did not ask the third accused why he did not tell him about\n\nthe postponement earlier.54. When the prosecutor asked him if it struck him as strange that the\n\nthird accused would stop his car along the side road and repeat what he had just said at\n\nthe petrol station toilet, he said that did not occur to him.55. When he was referred to his cautioned statement, he admitted that\n\nit was not correct that he only know the second accused, and not the third accused and\n\nthat he had not disclosed that he had met the third accused that morning. He explained\n\nthat when he made the statement he wanted to dissociate himself from the third accused.",
        "Defence of the second accused": "56. Like the first accused, he is from Bahau. He was 18 years 2 months\n\nold when he was arrested. He attended Chinese school up to the primary six level. After\n\nthat he worked as a house painter in Bahau. In December 1999 he went to Johor Bahru when\n\nthere was no work as a house painter. He was working in Johor Bahru with the first accused\n\nwhom he had known for three to four years. They were good friends and shared accommodation\n\nfrom 1 January 2000.57 He was not familiar with Singapore roads. He had come to Singapore\n\nwith the first accused on 1 January 2000 for a drive in the latter’s brother’s\n\ncar NAY 9960. On 2 January he came again with someone known to him as Yieh Chee or Ah Yap\n\nin motor car JCV 4973 belonging to the latter and they went shopping. On 4 January he came\n\nto Singapore again in the morning with the first accused in NAY 9960. He intended to buy\n\nclothes for the Chinese New Year. They met the latter’s friend at a coffee shop, then\n\nthey went shopping for clothes but did not buy anything. They went back to Johor Bahru at\n\nabout noon. In the afternoon, he entered Singapore again by himself in JCV 4973 for a\n\ndrive. He had not gone very far before he lost his way and ended up in Johor Bahru. He\n\nturned round, re-entered Singapore and drove around for about half an hour, then returned\n\nto Johor Bahru.58. On the next day, 5 January, the first accused woke him up in the\n\nmorning and asked him if he wanted to accompany him to Singapore. He asked the first\n\naccused to bring him to buy clothes and the first accused agreed. Subsequently they drove\n\ninto Singapore in JCV 4973. He sat in the front passenger’s seat. He did not carry\n\nanything with him to the car, and did not see any bag in it.59. They entered Singapore at about 9.10 am, stopped to have breakfast,\n\nand then made their way to a Shell petrol station at Dunman Road. The first accused parked\n\nthe car there. They went to a coffee shop for about half an hour, then returned to the\n\npetrol station. The first accused bought some coupons, then they got into the car and\n\ndrove around. At that time he asked the first accused where they were going, and was told\n\nthat he was waiting for a friend.60. After a while the first accused made a U-turn and went behind the\n\nthird accused’s car, then both cars moved off and went to the Esso petrol station\n\nalong Still Road. Both cars stopped at the petrol station. The first accused told him that\n\nhe wanted to go to the toilet, and left the car. About five minutes later, he returned and\n\ndrove off, but after travelling a short distance he stopped his car next to the grey car.\n\nThe first accused told him there was a bag under his seat, and instructed him to take it\n\nout and pass it to the person in the grey car. He bent down, felt for the bag, took it\n\nout, opened the car door and handed it to the third accused who was in the grey car\n\nthrough the window which was wound down, then the two cars drove off. The whole\n\ntransaction was over in about five seconds. He only remembered there was some white in the\n\ncolour of the bag, and that it was folded up, and he did not look inside it. When the bag\n\nrecovered from the third accused’s bedroom was shown to him in court, he could not\n\nsay if that was the bag.61. When he passed the bag to the third accused, the third accused did\n\nnot say anything. There was no prior arrangements between him and the first accused to\n\nhand over the bag to anyone, and that was the first time he saw the third accused. He had\n\nnot spoken with him before and had no dealings with him.62. Mr Dhillon put to the second accused that when the bag was passed\n\nover, the third accused said to the first accused \"I am busy. Why?\" and the\n\nfirst accused replied \"We’ll meet at night.\" The second accused’s\n\nresponse was that he did not hear this exchange.63. He admitted under cross-examination by the prosecutor that\n\nthroughout the investigations when statements were recorded from him on 11 and 19 January\n\nand 9 March, he did not mention the rendezvous at Dunman Road and Still Road. His\n\nexplanation was that he was very frightened and confused and did not know what to do.",
        "Defence of the third accused": "64. He is a Singapore citizen, 35 years old. He completed secondary one\n\nbefore he left school. At the time of his arrest he had an interest in a sawmill in Johor\n\nBahru and he had been going to Johor regularly since 1997.65. He had rented the bedroom on the ground floor of 253A Onan Road\n\nsince mid 1995. There were other bedrooms on the second floor of the premises which were\n\nrented out to and occupied by other tenants. He rented the bedroom so that his friends who\n\ncame to Singapore can use it instead of checking into hotels. A Vietnamese lady friend had\n\noccupied it at one time. His friends’ workers and his workers would use the room. He\n\nsaid that he seldom used it himself, and had not used it since the sawmill was\n\nincorporated on 23 November 1999, and had never spent the night there.66. He had known the first accused since 31 August 1999, and are normal\n\nfriends. The first accused had helped him in a purchase of timber on 22 December 1999. He\n\ndid not know the second accused and had not met him before the day of the arrest, and\n\nnever had any dealings with him.67. On 4 January he went to Johor to pay his employees in advance of\n\nHari Raya. After paying the salaries he received a page from the first accused and\n\nreturned his call. The first accused asked to meet him at a restaurant in Senai. When they\n\nmet there, the first accused told him that he had something to show him the next day and\n\nalso wanted to discuss matters pertaining to timber with him. He told the first accused\n\nthat he will be busy over the next few days and asked him not to show him timber samples.\n\nHe also told the first accused that if he wanted to look for him in Singapore, he should\n\ncheck in advance if he was in Singapore or Malaysia.68. After the meeting at the restaurant, he visited his girlfriend, and\n\nthen spent the night in a hotel in Johor Bahru by himself. In the morning of 5 January, he\n\nreceived a page from the first accused at about 9.45 am. When he returned the call the\n\nfirst accused told him he had something to show him and wanted to meet him in Singapore.\n\nHe told the first accused that he would only be in Singapore in an hour, and the first\n\naccused told him he would be at a hawker centre in Joo Chiat.69. He left the hotel at 10 am and drove to Joo Chiat. When they met in\n\ntheir respective cars he signaled to the first accused to follow him. He drove to a Esso\n\npetrol station in Still Road. He intended to fill up on petrol and pump his tyres at the\n\nEsso petrol station which was his regular petrol station for getting petrol. When he\n\nreached the petrol station he got out and pumped his tyres. The first accused also got out\n\nof his car, and proceeded to the toilet. After he pumped the tyres he also went to the\n\ntoilet because he needed to use it. When they met at the toilet the first accused told him\n\nhe had something to hand to him. He told the first accused \"no\", that he was\n\ngoing to a meeting with his shareholder, and was very busy, and departed from the toilet\n\nwithout asking the first accused what it was that he wanted to hand to him.70. He returned to his car, drove away, having forgotten about filling\n\npetrol. The first accused followed in his car, horned and blocked the way with his car.\n\nThe second accused opened the door of the first accused’s car and in a swift motion,\n\ndropped a bag onto his lap. He was surprised and told the first accused \"I’m\n\nbusy. What’s up?\" The first accused replied \"See you tonight\" and\n\ndrove off.71. After he received the bag he placed it on the front passenger seat\n\nof his car. The bag was taped, and he did not open it to check its contents. When his\n\ncounsel showed him the bag recovered from the bedroom he said it was not the bag he\n\nreceived. As he did not want to have so many things in his car, he drove to 253A Onan Road\n\nand left the bag on a table in the living room on the ground floor of the premises. While\n\nhe was there he wanted to use the toilet. He found the one on the ground floor was locked,\n\nand used the toilet upstairs. Then he left the premises after locking the main door.72. His counsel brought to his attention Sgt Lim Jit Tong’s\n\nevidence that he had entered the house twice, first empty-handed and then carrying a bag\n\n(to which there was no disagreement when Sgt Lim was cross-examined). He disagreed with\n\nSgt Lim’s evidence.73. After leaving the house he was driving to Bukit Batok to meet a\n\nshareholder when he was arrested in Clementi by CNB officers. They brought him back to the\n\nhouse where drugs and drug-related paraphernalia were recovered. He agreed that the bag\n\ncontaining the drugs was recovered from the study table in the bedroom but denied that he\n\nhad pointed to it with his chin when SSSgt Ang asked him where the drugs were. He denied\n\nthat the three packets inside the bag belonged to him or were handed to him by the second\n\naccused. He said that the other drugs and paraphernalia recovered did not belong to him,\n\nand that he had not seen them before.74. He claimed that the bag was shown to him in the bedroom after SSSgt\n\nAng had asked the first question recorded, which he understood to be whether there were\n\nanything in the room, not whether there was any drugs in the room. He denied that he gave\n\nthe second answer recorded that there was \"peh hoon\", and said that his answer\n\nwas that he did not know, and was not sure. He also did not give the third recorded answer\n\nthat there were two or three packets, but had said that he did not know. He did not say in\n\nreply to the fourth question that the heroin was to be handed to somebody, but had said\n\nthey did not belong to him. (Counsel had put this to SSSgt Ang, who disagreed with him.)\n\nHowever he confirmed that he gave the fifth answer recorded.75. He said that he signed the statement because his request for a\n\nsmoke and drink was turned down and SSSgt Ang threatened to hit his stomach if he did not\n\nsign.76. Counsel then brought him to the investigation statements recorded\n\nby Inspector Saherly with regard to the statement of 10 January. With regard to paragraph\n\n2 he confirmed that on 4 January the first accused had told him he wanted to pass\n\nsomething to him without stating what it was. However he denied that he had said he knew\n\nit would be \"peh hoon\" because they had done it a few times before.77. In paragraph 3 he had only said \"a white paper bag\"\n\nwithout the additional \"with blue wordings\". He also did not say that he went to\n\na room on the ground floor, but only that he entered the house. In the last sentence of\n\nthe paragraph, he did not say that he locked the room door before leaving but had said\n\nthat he locked the main door before leaving.78. When he was referred to the statement of 13 January, he said that\n\nparagraph 7 was not what he had said. As for paragraph 8, he disavowed the first three\n\nsentences and the reference to going to the room to deposit \"peh hoon\" and\n\ncollect payment.79. He also referred to paragraph 15 of his statement of 24 January. He\n\ndenied telling the first accused that there was no one around, or that they agreed to go\n\nfurther up. He repeated that he had only referred to a white paper bag (without reference\n\nto blue wordings) and that he placed the bag in the living room, and not his rented room\n\non the ground floor.80. Under cross-examination by the prosecutor he said that he did not\n\nwant to accept what the first accused wanted to hand over to him because he assumed they\n\nwere timber samples. After the bag came into his possession he did not open it, and\n\nintended to return it to the first accused.81. The prosecutor asked him why he kept the bag at 253A Onan Road when\n\nby his evidence he went there infrequently, and had not been there since 23 November 1999.\n\nHis reply was that the premises were the nearest to the Esso petrol station, and he had\n\nthe keys to the premises with him.82. He also explained that he did not place the bag in the bedroom he\n\nrented because somebody was staying there. When asked why he left the bag in the living\n\nroom which is accessible to other occupants and visitors to the house, he replied that he\n\nthough it was the natural thing to do.",
        "Evaluation of the evidence": "83. After hearing all the evidence, I reviewed the case of each accused\n\nperson.",
        "The first accused": "84. He knew the third accused, and they kept in touch by paging and\n\ntelephoning. He admitted that there was an appointment for him and the third accused to\n\nmeet on the morning of 5 January and they met at Dunman Road before going to the Esso\n\npetrol station at Still Road. He did not dispute that a bag in his car was passed over to\n\nthe third accused that morning.85. In addition to that the third accused and the second accused had\n\nmade damning allegations against him. The third accused, in his investigation statements,\n\nhad stated that the first accused had arranged to deliver to him something which through\n\nprevious transactions, he knew to be heroin. The second accused’s evidence was that\n\nhe instructed him to hand the bag over to the third accused.86. The first accused had put forth his account of the events, which I\n\nfound unsatisfactory. In his statement of 5 January, he stated that he had come to\n\nSingapore for sightseeing and that after breakfast at Bukit Panjang, he was going to Eunos\n\nto eat. This statement is untruthful because by his own evidence he did not make the trip\n\nto sightsee but had come to keep an appointment with the third accused, and that he did\n\nnot go to Eunos to eat, but went to Joo Chiat to meet the third accused.87. His cautioned statement is also untruthful. He knew that the person\n\nGue Huay Quee named in the charge is the third accused. Furthermore he did not go to the\n\nJoo Chiat coffee shop for something to eat, but to keep the appointment with the third\n\naccused.88. His account of the appointment and the postponement of the\n\ndiscussion lacked credibility. He said that he agreed to meet the third accused in\n\nSingapore for a discussion without being told what the third accused wanted to discuss,\n\nwithout knowing whether it would be of interest to him. On that morning when they spoke\n\nover the telephone when the third accused told him he would be late, and they met in Joo\n\nChiat before they went to the Esso petrol station at Still Road before the third accused\n\ntold him that he was too busy to talk. Any reasonable person in his position would be\n\nupset or annoyed to be put through all the trouble of coming to Singapore, and waiting for\n\nthe third accused, to be told that the discussion was to be postponed when it could have\n\nbeen rescheduled over the telephone, yet he was neither angry nor upset, and did not ask\n\nthe third accused why he did not reschedule the discussion earlier.89. His account of the events outside the Esso petrol station was also\n\nnot credible. His evidence was that the third accused had told him that he was not free to\n\ntalk, and asked to meet that night at Johor, and he had agreed. It did not make sense for\n\nthe third accused to stop his car along the side road to say again that they were to meet\n\nthat night.90. I also cannot accept his evidence that the second accused had acted\n\non his own during the brief unplanned stop to hand over the bag to the third accused who\n\nwas a stranger to him.",
        "The second accused": "91. His evidence that he did not know the third accused and had not\n\nseen him before 5 January and had no dealings with him was not disputed. The third accused\n\nconfirmed this in his statements and evidence.92. There was no direct evidence which implicated him. Neither the\n\nfirst nor the third accused said that he was involved in their appointment.93. On the other hand, he was not truthful when he said in his\n\ninvestigation statement that he and the first accused had gone shopping. He withheld\n\ndisclosure that he passed the bag to the third accused when he made his cautioned\n\nstatement and in his subsequent investigation statements.",
        "The third accused": "94. The drugs in question were recovered from his rented bedroom. SSSgt\n\nAng and Sgt Henry Chong gave evidence that he pointed to the bag containing the drugs when\n\nhe was asked where the drugs were.95. He had made statements to SSSgt Ang and Inspector Saherly which\n\nwere admitted in evidence after thevoir dire. I found that the statements were not\n\nonly voluntary, but that he was speaking the truth when he made them despite the\n\ninconsistency between his evidence and SSgt Lim’s whether he entered 253A Onan Road\n\nonce or twice that morning. I did not regard that to be material as he admitted that he\n\ntook the bag received from the first accused into the house.96. I did not accept his evidence that he was surprised when the bag\n\nwas delivered to him and had said \"Why? I am busy.\" It was significant that the\n\nsecond accused did not hear him say that.97. I also did not accept his explanation for keeping the bag at 253A\n\nOnan Road because he did not want to have too many things in his car. The bag was neither\n\nbulky nor heavy, and could easily be kept in the car without causing clutter or\n\noverloading. He said he was keeping the bag at 253A Onan Road till he can return it to the\n\nfirst accused. It was unreasonable for him to keep it at those premises which he claimed\n\nhe had not been to since 23 November 1999, thereby necessitating a return trip to the\n\npremises to retrieve it when he could have kept it in the car and returned it to the first\n\naccused when they met that night. His evidence that he had left the bag unguarded on the\n\ndining table in the living room accessible to the other occupants or visitors to the\n\npremises was unbelievable.",
        "My findings": "98. I accepted SSSgt Ang and Sgt Chong’s accounts of the recovery\n\nof the bag and found that the third accused’s statements to Inspector Saherly truly\n\ndescribed the events that took place. I also found that the first accused had instructed\n\nthe second accused to hand the bag to the third accused. I therefore found that the first\n\nand third accused were involved in trafficking the drugs in question.99. With regard to the second accused there was no direct evidence\n\nagainst him beyond his handing over of the bag, and that his co-accused did not implicate\n\nhim. I was mindful that he was not forthcoming in his cautioned statement and\n\ninvestigation statements. I took into account his age, education and employment background\n\nand his explanation for the non-disclosures. Upon careful review and consideration, there\n\nwas a reasonable doubt that he knowingly engaged in the dealings between the other two\n\naccused persons.100. I acquitted the second accused and amended the charge against the\n\nfirst and third accused toYou, KUM MUN HOU and GUE HUAY QUEEin furtherance of your common intention, on the 5thday of\n\n  January 2000, at about 11.00 a.m., along Still Road, Singapore, did jointly traffic in a\n\n  controlled drug specified in Class \"A\" of the First Schedule to the Misuse of\n\n  Drugs Act, Cap. 185, to wit, by having in your possession for the purpose of trafficking,\n\n  3 packets containing not less than 76.53 grams of diamorphine at the aforesaid place,\n\n  without any authorisation under the said Act or the regulations made thereunder, and you\n\n  have thereby committed an offence under section 5(1)(a) read with section 5(2) of the\n\n  Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap. 185 and section 34 of the Penal Code, Cap. 224 and punishable\n\n  under section 33 of the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap. 185.and convicted them, and passed the mandatory death sentence.101. The two convicted persons appeal against my decision.Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
