        "BACKGROUND": "4.    In this action, S3 seeks to rescind an agreement it had with\n\nSky Technology pursuant to which Sky Technology had assigned the patent rights of its invention to\n\nS3. S3 is alleging that Sky Technology had intentionally suppressed material information relating to\n\nthe patent rights. I was not informed as to what Sky Technologys counterclaim was about.5.    On 25 November 2000, the Writ of Summons was filed.6.    On 5 December 2000, S3 served an application for summary\n\njudgment.7.    On 15 January 2001, Sky Technology was granted unconditional\n\nleave to defend by SAR James Leong.8.    On 30 January 2001, S3 served its Notice of Appeal to a\n\njudge in chambers. On 31 January 2001, Sky Technology served its Defence and Counterclaim.9.    On 13 February 2001, Lai Siu Chiu J dismissed the appeal of\n\nS3. On 14 February 2001, S3 served its Reply & Defence to Counterclaim.10.    On 27 February 2001, S3 wrote in for further arguments\n\nbefore Lai J.11.    On 28 February 2001, the parties Counsel appeared before\n\nthe Registrar for further directions. By that time, the list of documents had been filed by Sky\n\nTechnology, and presumably by S3 too, in compliance with earlier directions. Furthermore, Sky\n\nTechnology had served an Amended Defence & Counterclaim and S3 had filed and served an Amended\n\nStatement of Claim.12.    At the hearing before the Registrar on 28 February 2001,\n\nvarious directions were given. The pertinent ones were:(a) The AEICs were to be exchanged by 30 March 2001 and objections thereto were\n\n  to be taken by 6 April 2001.(b) Leave was granted to Sky Technology to adduce the evidence of the following\n\n  witness orally at the trial of this action:(i) A representative from Allen & Gledhill,(ii) A representative from Chu Chan Gan & Ooi.(c) Trial be fixed for five days from 27 April 2001 to 4 May 2001 and to be set\n\n  down by 9 April 2001.13.    Mr Lok said that as at 28 February 2001, he was not aware\n\nof S3s request for further arguments. After he was aware, Sky Technology submitted further\n\nwritten arguments to Lai J on 3 March 2001.14.    On 5 March 2001, the parties Counsel attended before Lai\n\nJ for further arguments. The judge then ordered that Sky Technology be granted conditional leave to\n\ndefend instead. The condition was that Sky Technology was to provide $600,000 security for S3s\n\nclaim by 26 March 2001.15.    On 9 March 2001, Sky Technology wrote to request further\n\narguments before Lai J. The judge declined to hear further arguments and the parties solicitors\n\nwere informed of this in writing also on the same day.16.    On 16 March 2001, Sky Technology filed an appeal to the\n\nCourt of Appeal, as well as an application for an expedited appeal.17.    The parties Counsel attended before Chao Hick Tin JA for\n\nthis application to be heard at 3 pm of the same day.18.    The application was granted and directions were given. The\n\nappeal was subsequently heard on 22 March 2001.19.    The appeal to the Court of Appeal was unsuccessful. Sky\n\nTechnology then orally sought and was granted an extension of time of two weeks by the Court of\n\nAppeal to provide the security of $600,000, ie two weeks from the original dead-line of 26 March\n\n2001 under Lai Js decision. The new dead-line for provision of security was therefore 9 April\n\n2001.20.    Thereafter Sky Technology and its solicitors attempted to\n\nprepare and finalise the AEICs by 30 March 2001 but they were unable to do so.21.    On 30 March 2001, S3s solicitors Manjit & Partners\n\nsent a fax to Sky Technologys solicitors Rodyk & Davidson to arrange a time for the exchange\n\nof the AEICs.22.In response, Mr Lok Vi Ming of\n\nRodyk & Davidson called Mr Govind Menon of Manjit & Partners to say that Rodyk &\n\nDavidson would need an extension of about two weeks to exchange the AEICs. The reason given was that\n\nMs Winnie Tham of Allen & Gledhill was overseas. This implicitly meant that Rodyk & Davidson\n\nwere trying to contact her to get her evidence but were unable to do so by 30 March 2001.23.    This request drew a riposte from Manjit & Partners who\n\nquickly sent a telefax to Rodyk & Davidson to state, inter alia, that:Our clients find this last minute adjustment totally astonishing and\n\n  unsatisfactory. No proper regard has been given to the learned Registrars Order or the proper\n\n  administration of the Courts, not to say anything about the prejudice you are occasioning to our\n\n  clients by our inability to prepare for trial without your affidavits.24.    Rodyk & Davidson replied the same day stating, inter\n\nalia:As explained, Ms Winnie Tham from Messrs Allen & Gledhill is one of the\n\n  witnesses whom our clients had indicated they wish to call. She is currently overseas at a\n\n  Conference and will only be back after 4 April 2001.We will be grateful for your kind indulgence in this matter.25.    Thereafter, Rodyk & Davidson filed a Notice for Further\n\nDirections also on 30 March 2001 for an EOT to file the AEICs by 14 April 2001 and consequential\n\norders.26.    There was one supporting affidavit (the 2ndaffidavit) from Lim Yeow Beng, the Intellectual Property and Contracts Director of Sky Technology.\n\nIt said, inter alia:2. This action involves an agreement (\"the Agreement\") pursuant to\n\n  which the Defendant assigned the patent rights of their invention to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff\n\n  seeks to rescind the Agreement on the basis inter alia that the Defendant had intentionally\n\n  suppressed material information relating to the patent rights.3. At a hearing before the learned Registrar on 28 February 2001, the following\n\n  directions, inter alia, were made:a) That the Affidavit of evidence-in-chief be filed by 30 March 2001.b) That the objections to the Affidavits be made by 6 April 2001.c) That the action be set down for trial by 9 April 2001; for trial from 27\n\n    April 2001 to 4 May 2001.4. The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the\n\n  affidavits. Meanwhile, the Defendants efforts to prepare the affidavits expeditiously have been\n\n  affected by the following circumstances:-(a) The Plaintiff obtained leave, subsequent to the giving of the directions,\n\n    to make further arguments before Justice Lai Siu Chiu in respect of her earlier dismissal of\n\n    their appeal for summary judgment. The further arguments were heard on 5 March 2001 and, at the\n\n    end of a lengthy hearing, the learned Judge gave conditional leave to defend.(b) The Defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal against the learned Judges\n\n    order, and the appeal was heard on an expedited basis on 22 March 2001. The appeal was\n\n    unsuccessful. Much of the Defendants attention and effort were taken up by the hearing of the\n\n    further arguments and the appeal.(c) The Defendant had also previously indicated that they may call a lawyer\n\n    from M/s Allen & Gledhill to testify. In this regard, Ms Winnie Tham of M/s Allen &\n\n    Gledhill, who acted for the Defendant in the subject patent application, has been out of the\n\n    country since 23rdMarch 2001 and is understood that she will only return to\n\n    Singapore after 4 April 2001.27.    The application for EOT was served on 2 April 2001 at about\n\n3.35 pm. By then, Manjit & Partners had filed S3s application on 2 April 2001 at 3.19 pm to\n\nstrike out the Defence & Counterclaim with a supporting affidavit from Ho Kah Meng executed on 2\n\nApril 2001.28.    Sky Technologys application was fixed for hearing on 4\n\nApril 2001. S3s application was fixed for hearing on 6 April 2001 but was subsumed in the hearing\n\non 4 April 2001.29.    As I have mentioned, the Registrar dismissed Sky Technologys\n\napplication and ordered that its Defence be struck out and its Counterclaim be dismissed with costs.30.    On the same day, Rodyk & Davidson filed an appeal to\n\nthe judge in chambers. This was fixed for hearing on 10 April 2001.31.    Mr Lok Vi Ming for Sky Technology informed me that, as it\n\nturned out, the AEICs of two principal witnesses ie Gordon and Loewe Goh were completed and signed\n\nin the evening of 4 April 2001, ie on the same day that the Registrar dismissed the application for\n\nan extension of time. On that very day he was at an arbitration hearing, a lawyer from his firm was\n\npresenting arguments before the Registrar and a third lawyer was attending to the witnesses. Mr Lok\n\nsaid the AEICs for Sky Technology were voluminous and one was in three volumes. A statement of\n\nintended evidence from Mr Gan Choon Beng of Chan Gan & Ooi had been prepared and a similar\n\nstatement from Winnie Tham had also been prepared.32.    On 5 April 2001, another affidavit (the 3rdaffidavit) of Lim Yeow Beng was filed for the appeal to the judge-in-chambers. S3 responded by\n\nfiling the 3rdaffidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling on 9 April 2001.33.    In response, another affidavit, this time by Joanna Foong,\n\na solicitor with Rodyk & Davidson, was served on Manjit & Partners on 9 April 2001 at 6.55\n\npm.34.    According to the 3rdaffidavit of Mr Lim and/or\n\nthe affidavit of Joanna Foong, Gordon and Loewe Goh were supposed to attend at Rodyk & Davidsons\n\noffice in the week commencing 26 March 2001 to prepare the AEICs. They were however unable to attend\n\non 26 March 2001 due to urgent business commitments.35.    On 27 March 2001, they attended at Rodyk & Davidsons\n\noffice from the morning up to 8 pm with a lunch break in-between. On 28 and 29 March 2001, Joanna\n\nFoong and another lawyer were in the office until 1.30 am to complete the drafts. Drafts of the\n\nAEICs were going back and forth.36.    In the meantime, Ms Foong had contacted Winnie Thams\n\noffice on 27 March 2001 and learned that she was away in Melbourne at a patent seminar and would not\n\nbe back until 4 April 2001.37.    The AEICs could not be completed by 30 March 2001 although,\n\nby then, substantive draft AEICs had been prepared.THE LAW38.    Mr Manjit Singh for S3 repeatedly emphasized that the\n\nparamount consideration is the efficient administration of justice. According to him, a litigant who\n\nseeks any EOT is affecting the efficient administration of justice which would cause public\n\nprejudice. Such a litigant must show extenuating circumstances or that his is a special exception to\n\njustify an EOT.39.    Mr Singh also repeatedly submitted that there was no\n\nmaterial before the Registrar to grant an EOT. He said that even the new affidavits filed for Sky\n\nTechnology, after the Registrars decision and without leave of court, were not sufficient to\n\npersuade the court to allow the appeal for an EOT.40.    On the other hand, Mr Lok citedThe Tokai Maru[1998] 3 SLR 105.41.    In that case, an order was made for AEICs to be exchanged\n\nby 11 October 1996.42.    The applicants filed their AEICs only on 1 July 1997, about\n\nnine months after the dead-line, and served a copy on the respondents solicitors who refused to\n\nserve their clients affidavits in exchange. The applicants applied for an EOT and the respondents\n\napplied to strike out their defence. Both applications were heard on 15 July 1997 by a judge who\n\ndisallowed the application for an EOT and ordered the defence struck out and the applicants to pay\n\nthe respondents whatever sum might be found due to them on their claim.43.    The applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal on both the\n\ndecisions and both appeals were allowed.44.    The judge inThe Tokai Marucase had adopted the\n\nprinciple from the judgment of Lord Guest inRatnam v Cumarasamy[1965] 1 WLR 8 at p 12 that:The rules of court must prima facie be obeyed, and in order to justify a\n\n  court extending the time during which some step in procedure requires to be taken there must be\n\n  some material upon which the court can exercise discretion. If the law were otherwise, a party in\n\n  breach would have an unqualified right to an extension of time which would defeat the purpose of\n\n  the rules, which is to provide a time table for the conduct of litigation.45.    However Tan Lee Meng J, delivering the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeal inThe Tokai Maru,pointed out that inRatnam v Cumarasamy, Lord Guest\n\nhad made a point which distinguished an application for an EOT to file a notice of appeal and other\n\napplications for EOT. Lord Guest said, at p 12:In the one case, the litigant has had no trial at all; in the other he has\n\n  had a trial and lost.46.The judgment of Tan Lee Meng J\n\nthen went on to cite with approval the judgment of Sir Thomas Bingham MR inCostellow v Somerset\n\nCounty Council[1993] 1 All ER 952 at 959:As so often happens, this problem arises at the intersection of two\n\n  principles, each in itself salutary. The first principle is that the rules of court and the\n\n  associated rules of practice, devised in the public interest to promote the expeditious dispatch\n\n  of litigation, must be observed. The prescribed time limits are not targets to be aimed at or\n\n  expressions of pious hope but requirements to be met. This principle is reflected in a series of\n\n  rules giving the court a discretion to dismiss on failure to comply with a time limit: O 19 r 1, O\n\n  24 r 16(1), O 25 r 1(4) and (5), O 28 r 10(1) and O 34 r 2(2) are examples. This principle is also\n\n  reflected in the courts inherent jurisdiction to dismiss for want of prosecution.The second principle is that a plaintiff should not in the ordinary way be\n\n  denied an adjudication of his claim on its merits because of procedural default, unless the\n\n  default causes prejudice to his opponent for which an award of costs cannot compensate. This\n\n  principle is reflected in the general discretion to extend time conferred by O 3 r 5, a discretion\n\n  to be exercised in accordance with the requirements of justice in the particular case. It is a\n\n  principle also reflected in the liberal approach generally adopted in relation to the amendment of\n\n  pleadings.Neither of these principles is absolute. If the first principle were rigidly\n\n  enforced, procedural default would lead to dismissal of actions without any consideration of\n\n  whether the plaintiffs default had caused prejudice to the defendant. But the courts\n\n  practice has been to treat the existence of such prejudice as a crucial, and often a decisive,\n\n  matter. If the second principle were followed without exception, a well-to-do plaintiff willing\n\n  and able to meet orders for costs made against him could flout the rules with impunity, confident\n\n  that he would suffer no penalty unless or until the defendant could demonstrate prejudice. This\n\n  would circumscribe the very general discretion conferred by O 3 r 5, and would indeed involve a\n\n  substantial rewriting of the rule.The resolution of problems such as the present cannot in my view be governed by\n\n  a single universally applicable rule of thumb. A rigid, mechanistic approach is inappropriate .Cases involving procedural abuse (such asHytrac Conveyors Ltd v Conveyors\n\n  International Ltd[1982] 3 All ER 415, [1983] 1 WLR 44) or questionable tactics (such asRevici\n\n  v Prentice Hall Inc[1969] 1 All ER 772, [1969] 1 WLR 157) may call for special treatment. So,\n\n  of course, will cases of contumelious and intentional default and cases where a default is\n\n  repeated or persisted in after a peremptory order. But in the ordinary way, and in the absence of\n\n  special circumstances, a court will not exercise its inherent jurisdiction to dismiss a plaintiffs\n\n  action for want of prosecution unless the delay complained of after the issue of proceedings has\n\n  caused at least a real risk of prejudice to the defendant. A similar approach should govern\n\n  applications made under O 19, O 24, O 25, O 28 and O 34. The approach to applications under O 3 r\n\n  5 should not in most cases be very different. Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances,\n\n  it can rarely be appropriate, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny the\n\n  plaintiff an extension (where the denial will stifle his action) because of a procedural default\n\n  which, even if unjustifiable, has caused the Defendant no prejudice for which he cannot be\n\n  compensated by an award of costs. In short, an application under O 3 r 5 should ordinarily be\n\n  granted where the overall justice of the case requires that the action be allowed to proceed.47.    Tan Lee Meng J then stated the following principles:(a)(b) The rules of civil procedure guide the courts and litigants towards the\n\n  just resolution of the case and should of course be adhered to. Nonetheless, a litigant should not\n\n  be deprived of his opportunity to dispute the plaintiffs claims and have a determination of the\n\n  issues on the meritsas a punishmentfor a breach of these rulesunlessthe other\n\n  party has been made to suffer prejudice which cannot be compensated for by an appropriate order as\n\n  to costs.(c)Save in special cases or exceptional circumstances, it can rarely be\n\n  appropriate then, on an overall assessment of what justice requires, to deny a defendant an\n\n  extension of time where the denial would have the effect of depriving him of his defence because\n\n  of a procedural default which,even if unjustified, has caused the plaintiff no prejudice\n\n  for which he cannot be compensated by an award of costs.[Emphasis added.]48.    The distinction between an application to appeal out of\n\ntime and other applications to extend time was reiterated in the judgment of Lai Kew Chai J for the\n\nCourt of Appeal inLim Hwee Meng v Citadel Investment Pte Ltd[1998] 3 SLR 601which citedThe\n\nTokai Maruwith approval.49.Since then, the observations\n\nof Sir Thomas Bingham MR inCostellowhave been cited again with approval in the judgment of\n\nL P Thean JA for the Court of Appeal inLeong Mei Chuan v Chan Teck Hock David[2001] 2 SLR 17.50.It was therefore clear to me\n\nthat the arguments of Mr Singh were departing from the principles as laid down by our Court of\n\nAppeal.51.Mr Singh was bringing to the\n\nforefront the principle about the public interest in the efficient administration of justice while\n\npushing back to the background the other competing principle that a litigant should not be denied an\n\nadjudication of his position on its merits because of procedural default.52.Furthermore, Mr Singhs\n\nrepeated emphasis on the public interest was really to advance the interest of his own clients.53.After citing the legal\n\nprinciples, Tan Lee Meng J then considered the following questions:(a) Was the delay of nine months (inThe Tokai Maru) justified?(b) Was prejudice caused to the respondents?(c) Were there exceptional circumstances to warrant dismissing the application\n\n  for extension of time?WAS THE DELAY BY SKY TECHNOLOGY JUSTIFIED?54.    Adopting a similar approach, the first question I\n\nconsidered was whether the delay by Sky Technology was justified.55.The first and only reason\n\ngiven by Mr Lok in the telephone conversation of 30 March 2001 with Mr Menon and in the written\n\nreply of Rodyk & Davidson (see para 24 above) was the absence of Winnie Tham of Allen &\n\nGledhill. This was also one of the reasons stated in the 2ndaffidavit of Lim Yeow Beng\n\nbut it was not the only reason.56.I noted that when the\n\ndirections were given by the Registrar on 28 February 2001, leave had already been granted to Sky\n\nTechnology to adduce the evidence of a representative from Allen & Gledhill orally.57.Mr Lok said that, even so, the\n\nRegistrar had directed that a statement of the intended evidence should be filed.58.The draft Order of Court of 28\n\nFebruary 2001 which has been approved by both solicitors does not reflect this requirement, although\n\nit is a common requirement when leave is granted to adduce the evidence of a witness orally.59.    Besides, even if Mr Lok were correct, the AEICs of the two\n\nprincipal witnesses of Sky Technology, and the statement of intended evidence from Gan Choon Beng\n\ncould and should still have been completed on time.60.    Had this been done, leaving only the statement of intended\n\nevidence from Winnie Tham to be done, Mr Singh might not have objected to an EOT for that statement\n\nto be furnished later. Even if Mr Singh were to object, Sky Technology would have had a much better\n\nchance of persuading the Registrar to grant an EOT for this sole outstanding item, although I saw no\n\nreason why the statement of intended evidence from Winnie Tham should await her return. The very\n\nreason why Sky Technology had to obtain leave to adduce her evidence orally was, presumably, because\n\nshe might not co-operate. That should not stop Sky Technologys solicitors from filing a statement\n\nof the intended evidence that they were seeking from her. The statement would only identify the\n\nareas of fact on which her evidence was sought.61.The truth of the matter was\n\nthat Rodyk & Davidson and Sky Technology had used the absence of Winnie Tham to seek an EOT when\n\nthe real reason was something else. To this extent, their conduct was unsatisfactory.62.Unfortunately, theirs is not\n\nthe only instance of such conduct.63.Solicitors who have misjudged\n\nthe amount of time required to carry out a task and/or who have been too busily engaged in other\n\nmatters or who have overlooked a matter should have the courage to admit this in an application for\n\nEOT. I appreciate that some may fear that this will encourage their own clients to take action\n\nagainst them should the application for EOT fail, but, all things considered, I am of the view that\n\nit is preferable that they be candid with their opponents, the court and their clients.64.The true reason for the delay\n\nwas that Rodyk & Davidsons time and attention had been taken up and distracted by the\n\nhearings before Lai J and the Court of Appeal in respect of the application for summary judgment and\n\nconditional leave. They had misjudged the time required to prepare the AEICs.65.Although I had some sympathy\n\nfor the situation they found themselves to be in, the true reason was still not satisfactory. After\n\nall, S3s AEICs were ready by 30 March 2001.66.Hence, the delay was\n\nunjustified.WAS UNDUE PREJUDICE CAUSED TO S3?67.    The prejudice must be other than having to meet the case of\n\nSky Technology if an EOT is granted. Otherwise, every application for an EOT will be doomed from the\n\nstart.68.    I make this point because I am aware of submissions by\n\ncounsel in other cases that an EOT should be denied simply because, if it were to be granted, their\n\nclients would have to meet a case which they would not otherwise have to meet if the extension were\n\nnot granted.69.I prefer to use the label undue\n\nprejudice to emphasize the point that an EOT will often prejudice the other side to some extent,\n\nbut that, per se, is not sufficient to deny an EOT. It depends on the nature of the prejudice and\n\nthis is encapsulated in the principle that the prejudice must be one that cannot be compensated by\n\nan appropriate order as to costs.70.Mr Singh took exception to Mr\n\nLoks argument based on such a principle. He argued that to sanction such a principle would mean\n\nthat the efficient administration of justice can be bought off or overreached by an award of costs.71.I was of the view that Mr\n\nSinghs argument was an exaggerated one. The principle relied on by Mr Lok has been endorsed by\n\nthe courts in England and Singapore. Furthermore, no one has suggested that costs can be a cure-all.\n\nIndeed, theCostellowandThe Tokai Maruhave cautioned that in special or exceptional\n\ncircumstances, the payment of costs will not be sufficient to obtain an EOT.72.As for prejudice, Mr Singh\n\nargued that there was prejudice to S3 because although Sky Technology was not asking for the trial\n\ndates to be vacated, S3 would be compelled to do so in view of Mr Singhs other commitments.73.Mr Singh said that on 11 April\n\n2001, he had another hearing. On 17 April 2001, he was due to see a Queens Counsel in London on\n\nan unrelated matter. He would be back in Singapore by 23 April 2001. That would leave him with 23\n\nApril 2001 to 26 April 2001 (four days) before the trial starting on 27 April 2001. He pointed out\n\nrepeatedly that his was a small firm.74.On the other hand, when Mr\n\nSingh was submitting that there was no valid reason for Sky Technology to fail to comply with the\n\noriginal dead-line for the exchange of AEICs, he had submitted that the case was simple. He also\n\nsubmitted that in the light of the proceedings for summary judgment, Sky Technology already knew\n\nwhat was the substance of the case before the court.75.These very arguments of Mr\n\nSingh militated against his argument that he would not have sufficient time to prepare for trial if\n\nan EOT were granted to allow Sky Technology to exchange AEICs by 14 April 2001. Furthermore, as\n\ntheir AEICs, and statements of intended evidence, were ready by the time of the hearing before me,\n\nthey could be exchanged with the AEICs of S3 immediately or the next day ie 11 April 2001. Mr Singh\n\nshould have some time before he was to fly to meet Queens Counsel on 17 April 2001 and some time\n\nafter his return by 23 April 2001.76.It was clear to me that Mr\n\nSingh was blowing hot and cold.77.Furthermore, although Mr Singhs\n\nfirm is a small one, he is assisted by Mr Menon who appeared to have been involved with the case for\n\nsome time already if not right from the beginning.78.    Mr Menon could continue to take the witnesses of S3 through\n\nthe AEICs and statements of intended evidence for Sky Technology and prepare them for\n\ncross-examination when Mr Singh was away in London.79.Besides, as S3 is the\n\nplaintiff, Mr Singh would not have to do any cross-examination on the first day of trial. Mr Lok\n\nwould have to do that.80.As 27 April 2001 would be a\n\nFriday, there would be a weekend for Mr Singh to do some more preparation, if that was necessary.81.In the circumstances, the\n\nargument that S3 would be compelled to seek a vacating of the trial dates was without merit.82.This is reinforced by another\n\npoint.83.On 10 April 2001, Mr Singh had\n\ntwo matters before me. One was the appeal of Sky Technology in the present action. The other was an\n\nappeal in another action ie Suit No 229 of 200 between Les Placements Germain Gautheir Inv c Hong\n\nPian Tee (the Other Action). Mr Singh was representing the defendant in the Other Action.84.    The appeal in the Other Action was listed for hearing\n\nbefore the hearing of Sky Technologys appeal. However it was adjourned to a special date to be\n\nfixed.85.When I was considering the\n\ndirections I should make about that special date, Mr Singh requested that I direct that the appeal\n\n(in the Other Action) be fixed for hearing on a date after the trial dates of the S3 action against\n\nSky Technology. He explained that if Sky Technologys appeal was successful, he would then be\n\nengaged in the trial of S3s action.86.In the light of Mr Singhs\n\nrequest, I directed accordingly. Yet he was arguing emphatically before me in Sky Technologys\n\nappeal as to how S3 would have to seek a vacating of the trial dates because of his tight schedule\n\nif an EOT was granted to Sky Technology.87.I stress that even if Mr Singh\n\nhad not made the request I have mentioned, my conclusion about the lack of merits in his argument\n\nabout the vacating of the trail dates would have been the same.88.In the circumstances, the\n\ncases cited by Mr Singh, ie the unreported decision of Chan Seng Onn JC in Suit No 320 of 1997 andChan\n\nKern Miang v Kea Resources Pte Ltd[1999] 1 SLR 145were not applicable because these were cases\n\nin which a party was applying for the trial dates to be vacated.89.I was of the view that there\n\nwas no undue prejudice to S3 if EOT was granted to Sky Technology to exchange the AEICs by 11 April\n\n2001 ie one day after the hearing before me.WHETHER THERE WERE EXCEPTIONAL CIRCUMSTANCES TO WARRANT DISMISSING THE\n\nAPPLICATION FOR EXTENSION OF TIME90.    The affidavits filed for S3, the written submissions and Mr\n\nSinghs oral submissions advanced numerous arguments about the conduct of Sky Technology and/or\n\ntheir solicitors.First Argument91.    First, Mr Singh argued that the excuse about Winnie Tham\n\nwas not a true one. I have already dealt with that and need say no more on it, except to add that\n\nwhile I found the attempt to rely on the Winnie Tham excuse unsatisfactory, I would stop short of\n\ncalling it deplorable.Second Argument92.    (a) Mr Singh stressed that Rodyk & Davidson should have\n\ninformed his firm much earlier that they were unable to complete the AEICs in time. He even pointed\n\nout that at the hearing before the Court of Appeal on 22 April 2001, Rodyk & Davidson had asked\n\nfor an EOT to provide the $600,000 security but did not do so for the AEICs.(b) However, as Mr Lok put it, Rodyk & Davidson did not have prior knowledge\n\nthat they would be unable to meet the dead-line for the AEICs. They were trying their best to meet\n\nthe dead-line but were unable to do so.(c) The fact that they informed Manjit & Partners on the very last day and\n\nonly after they had received a fax from Manjit & Partners is immaterial. I have no doubt that if\n\nthey had informed Manjit & Partners just the day before about their predicament, he would still\n\nhave objected to an EOT.Third Argument93.    (a) Mr Singh argued that if Sky Technology was granted an\n\nEOT, this would mean that it would have had more time to prepare its AEICs than S3. I was of the\n\nview that while this is true as a fact, it was not a valid argument. If S3s AEICs had not been\n\nready by the dead-line, S3 would be in no position to object to the application for an EOT by Sky\n\nTechnology.(b) While it is to the credit of S3 and their solicitors that they have met the\n\ndead-line, notwithstanding all the distractions in-between, this did not in turn mean that the\n\napplication of Sky Technology for an EOT should be rejected. It is in the very nature of an\n\nobjection to such an application that the party who is objecting has met the dead-line whereas the\n\nother has not.(c) Besides, Mr Singh was not suggesting that if an EOT was to be granted to Sky\n\nTechnology, then S3 should have the same EOT to file supplementary AEICs if S3 thought fit to do so.Fourth Argument94.    (a) Mr Singh argued that he was not informed that the AEICs\n\nof the principal witnesses had been signed by the evening of 4 April 2001. He only learned about it\n\nat the hearing before me. He went on to say that had he been informed, the AEICs could have been\n\nexchanged before the hearing of the appeal on 10 April 2001. While he was implying that he would\n\nhave agreed to such an exchange then, he stopped short of actually saying so.(b) However, I note that in para 6 of the 3rdaffidavit of Mr Lim\n\nexecuted on 4 April 2001, and filed on 5 April 2001, Mr Lim had said that Sky Technology was in a\n\nposition now to file and serve the affidavits of Gordon Goh and Loewe Goh. This 3rdaffidavit was served on Manjit & Partners on 5 April 2001 at 4.30 pm whereupon they prepared and\n\neventually filed an affidavit, ie the 3rdaffidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling, in response on\n\n9 April 2001. Manjit & Partners were therefore aware some time before the hearing on 10 April\n\n2001 that the AEICs for Sky Technology had been completed on 4 April 2001. Yet they did not suggest\n\nthat the AEICs be exchanged before 10 April 2001.Fifth Argument95.    (a) An argument was also raised that Sky Technologys\n\nrepresentatives were more interested in crucial business negotiations than in meeting the courts\n\ndead-line.(b) This argument was raised because Sky Technology had sought to explain why\n\nGordon and Loewe Goh were unable to attend at Rodyk & Davidsons office for the preparation of\n\ntheir AEICs on 26 April 2001.(c) I was of the view that Sky Technology was trying to be candid but S3 sought\n\nto turn this explanation against it by the argument I have mentioned. S3 even labelled the\n\nnon-attendance, for one day, as disgraceful.(d) I was of the view that this was an exaggeration by S3.Sixth Argument96.    (a) Mr Singh complained that his firm was not even informed\n\non 30 March 2001 that Rodyk & Davidson were filing an application for an EOT. He knew about it\n\nonly when it was served on 2 April 2001 at 3.35 pm but by then his firm had already filed S3s\n\napplication against Sky Technology for its failure to meet the dead-line.(b) While Rodyk & Davidson should have informed Manjit & Partners that\n\nthey were filing an application for extension, I did not read as much into it as Mr Singh wanted me\n\nto. Obviously Rodyk & Davidson were themselves hard-pressed and inadvertently omitted to give\n\nManjit & Partners advance notice of their intention.(c) Besides, their omission was immaterial.Seventh Argument97.    (a) After Lim Yeow Bengs 2ndaffidavit was\n\nfiled for Sky Technologys application for EOT, and a 3rdone was filed thereafter for\n\nthe appeal before me, Mr Singh complained that the Gohs should have executed these affidavits and\n\nnot Mr Lim who had no knowledge about the dispute.(b) I was of the view that this complaint was not a valid one. Mr Lim is the\n\nIntellectual Property & Contracts Director of Sky Technology. There was no material to suggest\n\nthat only the Gohs can sign affidavits for an application for EOT. Such affidavits were not the\n\nAEICs.Eighth Argument98.    (a) Mr Singh drew my attention to paragraph 4 of the 2ndaffidavit of Mr Lim which began with this sentence:The directions provided a short time frame for the preparation of the\n\n  affidavits.Mr Singh said that this was an implied criticism of the courts.(b) In Mr Lims 3rdaffidavit, he said that no disrespect was\n\nintended to the court by the sentence I have mentioned. However, this did not satisfy Mr Singh. He\n\nstressed that there was no retraction of the offending sentence and no apology to the court.(c) As the parties had been given slightly over a month to prepare the AEICs, I\n\nwas of the view that Mr Lims sentence should have been more carefully worded. However, I was also\n\nof the view that in the light of his 3rdaffidavit, nothing more should turn on it. Also,\n\neven if his 3rdaffidavit had not been filed, I was of the view that offence should not\n\nbe taken too quickly as his 2ndaffidavit was obviously prepared in a rush and should be\n\nread in the context of the other matters that occupied the time and attention of Rodyk &\n\nDavidson.(d) I was also of the view that it was not for Mr Singh to take umbrage on behalf\n\nof the court.Ninth Argument99.    (a) Mr Singh also submitted that the two new affidavits by\n\nMr Lim and Joanna Foong should have been brought to the attention of the Registrar in the context of\n\nfurther arguments so that the Registrar could deal with the new material in these affidavits. He\n\nsaid it was unfair for Sky Technology to require me to reverse the Registrars decision not on\n\nmaterial placed before the Registrar but on new material consciously not pleaded before the\n\nRegistrar.(b) I did not accept this argument. In the first place, the two affidavits were\n\nprimarily to elaborate on points already taken in Mr Lims 3rdaffidavit.(c) Moreover, Sky Technology was not consciously withholding the material in the\n\ntwo new affidavits. They had filed Mr Lims 2ndaffidavit on an urgent basis to support\n\nits application for EOT. When this application failed, the only natural step was to file a Notice of\n\nAppeal to the judge on an urgent basis if the trial dates were not to be jeopardised. Pending the\n\nhearing of the appeal, the two new affidavits were filed.(d) Furthermore, if Sky Technology had sought further arguments before the\n\nRegistrar and was unsuccessful again, precious time would have been wasted and the appeal to the\n\njudge would have been heard even later.(e) Indeed, if Sky Technology had sought further arguments before the Registrar\n\nand was unsuccessful, I would not have been surprised if Mr Singh was then to argue that Sky\n\nTechnology should not have sought further arguments and should have appealed immediately to the\n\njudge.Tenth Argument100.    (a) Mr Singh argued that when Sky Technology chose to move\n\nquickly, it could do so. Hence, the application for EOT was filed on the same day when Rodyk &\n\nDavidson had informed his firm that they were unable to exchange the AEICs on time.(b) I was of the view that this too was not a valid argument. On that day, Rodyk\n\n& Davidson knew that they were unable to complete the AEICs on time and also knew that they were\n\nnot going to get any quarter from Manjit & Partners in view of their strong objection. The\n\napplication for EOT had to be filed immediately.(c) Besides, I did not agree that Sky Technology and Rodyk & Davidson had in\n\nthe past been dragging their feet as Mr Singhs argument was suggesting.Eleventh Argument101.    (a) Mr Singh also pointed out that when Rodyk &\n\nDavidson were seeking an urgent date for the hearing of the appeal to the judge, they did not give\n\nthe right reason to the Duty Registrar and instead gave some unconnected reason.(b) I was of the view that while that was true, it was neither here nor there\n\nsince Mr Singh was not suggesting that there was any attempt to deceive the Duty Registrar.Twelfth Argument102.    (a) Mr Singh said that when the hearing date of 10 April\n\n2001 was obtained for the appeal before me, Rodyk & Davidson did not check whether that date was\n\nsuitable for him. He complained that they were only acting to suit themselves.(b) I did not agree. Rodyk & Davidson themselves had no advance knowledge\n\nwhat date would be given for the appeal. Besides, developments were occurring quickly and they had\n\nto move even more quickly. They did not have the luxury of contemplating whether to keep Manjit\n\n& Partners informed of each and every development. Also, they were not legally obliged to keep\n\nManjit & Partners so informed.(c) Mr Singh also said that previously as regards Sky Technologys application\n\nfor an expedited appeal to the Court of Appeal against Lai Js decision, he was given less than\n\ntwo hours notice to appear before Chao JA and he was being required to work to the timetable of\n\nSky Technology.(d) Again I did not agree. It was the Duty Registrar who had fixed the\n\nappointment before Chao JA in view of the intention to have an expedited appeal. The Duty Registrar\n\nwas being helpful and solicitors from both sides had to work on an urgent basis. This was not a\n\nsituation of Mr Singh having to work to the timetable of Sky Technology.Thirteenth Argument103.    (a) Mr Singh argued that the Notice of Appeal against the\n\nRegistrars decision on EOT still sought a fourteen day extension in defiance of the Registrar.(b) I was of the view that this was not a valid argument. Sky Technology had\n\noriginally sought a fourteen day extension and the Notice of Appeal had sought the same extension.\n\nThere was no question of defying the Registrar as Sky Technology was exercising its right to appeal.Fourteenth Argument104.    (a) Paragraph 4 of the affidavit of Ho Kah Meng for S3 to\n\nresist the initial application for EOT accused Sky Technology of unilaterally deciding to vary the\n\ndirections of the Registrar given on 28 February 2001.(b) Again, this was not a valid argument. Sky Technology had not unilaterally\n\ndecided to do anything. It was unable to meet a dead-line and had to apply for EOT.Fifteenth Argument105.    (a) Mr Singh stressed repeatedly that Rodyk & Davidson\n\nstill had not listed the names of their witnesses notwithstanding his requests to them to do so as a\n\nresult of which he could not extract the order of 28 February 2001.(b) However, I did not think this was deliberate on the part of Rodyk &\n\nDavidson. So many things were happening, the most important of which was the appeal to the Court of\n\nAppeal and, on the conditional leave, the provision of the security thereafter and the preparation\n\nof the AEICs. The action was only required to be set down by 9 April 2001. If the AEICs (for Sky\n\nTechnology) could have been completed on time, Rodyk & Davidson would no doubt have provided the\n\nlist of their witnesses upon being reminded that it was still outstanding.Sixteenth Argument106.    (a) The submissions of S3 also pointed out another\n\ninstance of alleged delaying tactic on the part of Sky Technology. Apparently, on or about 14 March\n\n2001, Manjit & Partners had sought copies of correspondence for preparation of AEICs for S3 and\n\nthese copies were not provided promptly.(b) The letter dated 14 March 2001 was not produced to me.(c) In any event, as a general rule, an instance of delay in responding to a\n\nrequest cannot be categorised as deplorable conduct and there is no evidence before me that the\n\ndelay was deliberately intended to hinder the preparation of the AEICs for S3.Summary107.    Ultimately, I was of the view that S3 and Mr Singh were\n\njust trying to find fault with every act or omission of Sky Technology and of Rodyk & Davidson\n\nso that they would be punished by a denial of EOT.108.    S3 and Mr Singh also used a plethora of words like deplorable,\n\ndisgraceful, cavalier, lackadaisical, no apology, no retraction, offensive,\n\nconsciously, in defiance and unilaterally deciding for their mission. However, I\n\nwas unmoved.109.    Their arguments were not valid and the use of such\n\nlanguage did not advance their position any further.Order 25 Rule 3(2) Rules of Court110.    Mr Singh pointed out that the Singapore Rules of Court O\n\n25 r 3(2) states:Where any party fails to comply with the Courts directions for the filing\n\n  and exchange of affidavits, an application may be made by summons at any time after the default\n\n  for an order to enter judgment or to dismiss the action, as the case may be, or for such other\n\n  order as to costs or otherwise that the Court thinks just in the circumstances.111.    He stressed that this provision was peculiar to Singapore.\n\nHe was suggesting that a failure to exchange AEICs on time would lead to more drastic consequences\n\nthan a failure to comply with any other provision in the Rules of Court in time.112.    I did not agree.The Tokai Marualso involved a\n\ncase of the late filing or exchange of AEICs. Indeed the length of the delay there was much longer\n\nand the reason for delay there was even less justifiable. I presumed that the Court of Appeal inThe\n\nTokai Maruwas aware of O 25 r 3(2).113.In any event, in the absence\n\nof any express provision to the contrary, I was not prepared to treat the failure to exchange AEICs\n\nin time as an exception to the principles laid down inThe Tokai Maru.114.    In the circumstances, there was no exceptional reason to\n\nwarrant the dismissal of the application for EOT.115.    Indeed, as Mr Lok submitted, this was not a situation\n\nwhere Sky Technology was in the habit of allowing dead-lines imposed by the court to pass without\n\ndoing anything.116.    Furthermore, the parties had gone through an application\n\nfor summary judgment before a registrar, an appeal to a judge in chambers, further arguments\n\nthereon, an expedited appeal to the Court of Appeal and Sky Technology had provided the security of\n\n$600,000. It was also ready with its AEICs before the appeal to me was heard.117.    I would add that my decision would have been the same even\n\nif the two fresh affidavits (ie Mr Lims 3rdaffidavit and Joanna Foongs affidavit)\n\nwere not filed after the Registrars decision on 4 April 2001. I allowed arguments thereon because\n\nthey contained primarily elaboration. Furthermore, S3 had filed an affidavit of Dr Yang Jian Ling in\n\nresponse to Mr Lims 3rdaffidavit and Mr Singh was, to his credit, in a position to\n\nadvance arguments in response to Joanna Foongs affidavit.Interference with the Registrar decision118.    Mr Singh cited the case ofWright Norman v\n\nOversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd[1992] 2 SLR 710for the principle that in the absence of clear\n\nerror of law or principle, an appellate court should not interfere.119.    I noted that that principle was said in the context of an\n\nappeal to the Court of Appeal and not an appeal from a registrar to a judge.120.    Mr Singh further submitted that the Registrar had acted on\n\nestablished principles, meaning the principle he was advocating.121.    However, he stopped short of saying that the Registrar had\n\nacted on the principles laid down inThe Tokai Maruand the subsequent decisions of the Court\n\nof Appeal that I have mentioned.122.    I was of the view that the principles laid down in those\n\ndecisions lead to the inevitable conclusion that an EOT should be granted to Sky Technology.123.    As the hearing of the appeal concluded at about 6.30 pm, I\n\ngranted an EOT for the AEICs of both sides to be exchanged by the next day with consequential orders\n\nfor the date for objection to be taken and for setting down to be extended.COSTS124.    In Mr Singhs request for further arguments, he said,\n\ninter alia, that S3 could not appreciate why it was not awarded costs (of its application before the\n\nRegistrar, Sky Technologys application before the Registrar and Sky Technologys appeal before\n\nme) on an indemnity basis. I rejected the request for further arguments.125.    I was of the view that the argument that S3 could not\n\nappreciate my decision on costs was an emotional argument and, hence, irrelevant. A partys\n\nargument is not augmented by its failure to appreciate the courts view or decision.126.    The usual rule is that costs are granted on a standard\n\nbasis, in the absence of a contractual provision to the contrary.127.    Hence, even if a defendant is dragged to court through no\n\nfault of his own, he is still awarded costs on a standard basis.128.    Another illustration is where one party seeks to amend his\n\npleading. The costs of that application and any costs consequential on the amendment are, again,\n\nusually awarded to the other side on a standard basis even though the amendment arises through no\n\nfault of the other side.129.    As for applications for EOT, these are not uncommon and\n\nare usually again met with an order for costs on a standard basis. The nature of such applications\n\nand the legal principles are not novel or complex.130.    The facts of the application of Sky Technology for EOT\n\nwere also not complex.131.    I also did not think that the conduct of Sky Technology\n\nand/or Rodyk & Davidson was so bad that it warranted an order for costs on an indemnity basis.132.    It is true that there was considerable urgency, but that\n\ndid not warrant an order for costs on an indemnity basis. Besides, I took into account the element\n\nof urgency before I fixed the quantum of the costs.133.    As for the length of the hearing before the Registrar,\n\nthere was no suggestion that it was particularly long.134.    As for the hearing before me, this took about three hours.\n\nThis was mainly because of the numerous, but invalid, arguments advanced by Mr Singh and also\n\nbecause he repeated some of his arguments from time to time. In view of that I had contemplated\n\nwhether S3 should even be awarded full costs on a standard basis.135.    However, as Mr Lok did not dispute that S3 should be\n\nentitled to full costs on such a basis, I awarded S3 its full costs on a standard basis and fixed it\n\nat $14,000.Woo Bih LiJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
