        "1STCHARGE": "on the 21stday of May 2001, at or\n\n  about 10.30 a.m., at Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd, Tanglin Shopping Centre, #03-07, Singapore, did\n\n  cause grievous hurt to one Neo Aee Kee, f/41 years, to wit, by pouring inflammable liquid on the\n\n  said Neo Aee Kees head, face and body and setting her on fire, with such intention and under\n\n  circumstances that if, by these acts, you had caused death, you would have been guilty of murder\n\n  and by such acts, you had caused grievous hurt to the said Neo Aee Kee and you have thereby\n\n  committed an offence under section 307(1) of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.\"In addition, he pleaded guilty to one Charge of criminal breach of trust by a\n\nservant under Section 408 of the Penal Code in respect of $3,297. He also admitted one other charge\n\nunder Section 408 of the Penal Code involving $2,750.65 and consented that this be taken into\n\nconsideration for the purpose of sentence.2 Section 307 of the Penal Code is in these terms:\"307.(1) Whoever does any act with such intention or knowledge\n\n  and under such circumstances that if he by that act caused death he would be guilty of murder,\n\n  shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years, and shall also be\n\n  liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such act, the offender shall be liable\n\n  either to imprisonment for life, or to such punishment as is hereinbefore mentioned and shall also\n\n  be liable to caning.(2) When any person offending under this section is under sentence of\n\n  imprisonment for life, he may, if hurt is caused, be punished with death.\"\"Hurt\" i.e. \"bodily pain, disease or infirmity\" (as defined\n\nin 319 of the Penal Code) is sufficient to attract life imprisonment and caning. Section 408\n\nprovides for mandatory imprisonment of up to 7 years and a discretionary fine. I sentenced the\n\nAccused to life imprisonment on the First Charge, deemed to have commenced on 21 May 2001, and to 6\n\nmonths imprisonment on the Second Charge, both sentences to run concurrently.THE FACTS3 The Prosecutions Statement of Facts set out the circumstances surrounding\n\nthe two Charges proceeded with:\"Facts Leading to the 1stCharge (Section 307 of the\n\n  Penal Code)The victim is Neo Aee Kee, Stella, female/41 years old. She is an\n\n  administration clerk working for M/s Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd, located at Tanglin Shopping Centre\n\n  #03-07, Singapore. The company was incorporated in 1999.2 The accused is Ng Kwok Soon, male/50 years old, residing at Blk 80, Chay Yan\n\n  St #03-08, Singapore. He is one of the three directors of Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd.3 The witnesses are:(i) Kong Chee Seng, male/44 years old. He is the victims husband and\n\n    another one of the directors of Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd.(ii) Chan Ee Me, female/47 years old. She is a stall helper employed by M/s\n\n    Tanglin Delight located at #03-45 Tanglin Shopping Centre, which unit faces M/s Interior Fabrics\n\n    Pte Ltd.",
        "First Information Report & Police Response": "4 On 21 May 2001 at about 10.30 a.m., the accused made a 999 call and\n\n  reported that \"There is a fire and one lady got burnt. I am the culprit who burnt her\".5 Police officers were immediately despatched to the scene. On arrival at the 3rdfloor of Tanglin Shopping Centre, the police officers saw the victim seated on a sofa inside shop\n\n  unit #03-07 (Interior Fabric Pte Ltd). They noticed that she had sustained burns on her head, face\n\n  and both her hands. Upon interviewing her, the victim told the police that her injuries were\n\n  inflicted by the accused. The accused was then standing outside the shop unit. When the police\n\n  officers walked towards him, he admitted he had set the victim on fire. He also informed them that\n\n  he had made the 999 call and reported the incident.6 The accused was then placed under arrest and conveyed to Tanglin Police\n\n  Division. The victim was conveyed to Singapore General Hospital (SGH) for medical treatment by\n\n  ambulance.",
        "Events leading up to the Commission of the Offence": "7 Investigations revealed that the accused and the victim were colleagues in\n\n  M/s Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd. The victim, who was the wife of Kong Chee Seng (one of the\n\n  directors) was employed as the administration clerk and managed the administration and financial\n\n  work of the company.8 A few months after the company was set up, the accused and the victim had\n\n  some disagreements over the debts owed to the company by the accuseds customers and the general\n\n  operations of the company. As a result their working relationship deteriorated.9 On 21 May 2001 at about 7.30 a.m., before leaving for work, the accused took\n\n  two empty glass bottles. He later filled them up with methanol spirit, a flammable liquid. He had\n\n  purchased the methanol spirit from a hardware shop sometime earlier.10 At about 9.10 a.m., the accused was already in their shop office when the\n\n  victim and her husband, Kong Chee Seng, arrived. Moments later, the victim raised her voice and\n\n  demanded that she wanted to have a meeting immediately to discuss the matter of the debts owed to\n\n  the company. In the course of the meeting, the victim asked the accused to explain why he had not\n\n  been able to collect outstanding debts from his clients, some dating as far back as June 2000. Not\n\n  receiving a satisfactory reply, the victim demanded that the accused write a letter of explanation\n\n  for his inability to collect the debts. Thereafter the meeting concluded. About 20 minutes later,\n\n  the victims husband left the office for an appointment.11 A while later, while the victim was seated at her table doing some\n\n  paperwork, the accused got up from his chair and took the two bottles containing the methanol\n\n  spirit. He quietly opened the caps of the two bottles and walked towards the back of the victim.\n\n  Then, standing close behind the victim, the accused called out to the victim by her name.12 When the victim turned around to face him, the accused immediately poured\n\n  one of the bottles of methanol spirit onto her head. He then quickly lighted a tissue paper and\n\n  threw it on the victims head. As the victim screamed in pain, the accused took the second\n\n  bottle and poured the contents onto her body. A short while later, one Chan Ee Me, who was working\n\n  at a snack bar, M/s Tanglin Delight, located directly opposite Interior Fabric Pte Ltd, saw the\n\n  victim crawl out of the office with her body ablaze. The accused was seen walking behind the\n\n  victim. The victim saw a basin of water inside the snack bar and poured it over her face to douse\n\n  the flames. Chan Ee Me too helped the victim by putting out the fire with a piece of cloth.",
        "Medical Examination of the Victim": "13 In a medical report dated 6 June 2001 (please refer to medical report at\n\n  Annex A), Dr Mark Thong of Singapore General Hospital stated that the victim sustained burns over\n\n  35% of her total body surface. She underwent an operation for excision and skin grafting of neck,\n\n  chest and both upper and lower limbs on 23 May 2001. He also added that the victims injuries\n\n  required her to be intubated and artificially ventilated. The victim was very ill and unstable.\n\n  She also developed septicaemia and hypotension requiring inotropic support and close fluid\n\n  monitoring.14 In another report dated 29 October 2001 (please refer to medical report MR/06510/2001\n\n  at Annex B), Dr Tan Kok Chai, Senior Consultant Plastic Surgeon and Head of Department of Plastic\n\n  Surgery at Singapore General Hospital highlighted that the victim had undergone further operations\n\n  for excision and skin grafting on 25 May 2001, 28 May 2001, 30 May 2001, 1 June 2001 and 4 June\n\n  2001 before being discharged on 7 September 2001. The victim was readmitted on 15 October 2001 to\n\n  release contractures of neck and axillaes before being discharged again on 26 October 2001. Dr Tan\n\n  is of the opinion that the victim will require further surgery and follow-up.15 In yet a further report dated 5 November 2001 (please refer to medical\n\n  report MR/06510/2001 at Annex C), Dr Tan elaborated that the victim had sustained serious life\n\n  threatening burn injuries that required prolonged intubation and ventilation. She was listed as\n\n  critically ill for more than 4 weeks. She also requires secondary corrections of contractures of\n\n  necks, face and arms. Dr Tan highlighted that the victims scarring of burning areas will\n\n  be permanent.",
        "Facts leading to the 2ndCharge (Section 408 of the Penal Code)": "16 The complainant is Kong Chee Seng, male/44 years old. He is a director of\n\n  Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd.17 The witness is Madam Elvi Yanti Sie, female/37 yrs, an Indonesian national\n\n  residing at River Place #07-28, Havelock Road, Singapore.18 On 31 May 2001 at about 5.23 pm, the complainant lodged a police report at\n\n  Tanglin Police Division to report that the accused had taken his companys (M/s Interior Fabrics\n\n  Pte Ltd) money.19 Investigations revealed that sometime in June 2000, Madam Elvi Yantie Sie\n\n  contacted the accused, who is a director of M/s Interior Fabrics Pte Ltd, for the purpose of\n\n  furnishing her residence with curtains in the living room, dining room and the bedrooms. The\n\n  accused charged her a sum of S$5,997. Madam Elvi Yantie Sie gave the accused a cash deposit\n\n  amounting to S$2,700 which the accused subsequently handed over to the company. Madam Elvi Yantie\n\n  Sie agreed to pay the balance amount of S$3,297 to the accused upon completion of the work.20 In August 2000, on completion of the work, Madam Elvi Yantie Sie paid the\n\n  remaining sum of S$3,297 in cash to the accused. The accused collected the payment but did not\n\n  hand it over to the company. The accused admitted that he had spent the sum of S$3,297 on himself.\n\n  He is accordingly charged.\"4 12 photographs of Madam Neo Aee Kee taken by her husband at their home in\n\nOctober 2001 were also tendered in Court.The Prosecutions Submissions on Sentence5 The Accused had no criminal record prior to this incident.6 The Prosecution asked that a sentence be passed which would adequately reflect\n\nthe Accuseds evil act and the victims suffering. It was a brutal attack which was not the\n\nresult of what the victim said or did in the morning of 21 May 2001. It was also planned. That was\n\nevident in the Accused bringing the two empty bottles to the office that morning, filling them up\n\nwith the flammable liquid and waiting until after the victims husband had left for an appointment\n\nbefore striking.7 The Accused was deaf to the victims screams. He mercilessly poured the other\n\nbottles contents on her to intensify her pain and suffering, showing his clear intention of\n\nsending her to the grave.8 The Accused did not have any past history of psychiatric illness. Two days\n\nafter the attack, he was assessed at the Woodbridge Hospital and found to be depressed and on the\n\nverge of tears at certain times but could give a coherent and relevant account of the events of 21\n\nMay 2001. He was started on antidepressant medication and his mood improved over the next two weeks.\n\nHe was cooperative and consistent in his account of his behaviour and also expressed remorse for his\n\naction. His depression did not amount to unsound mind at the time of the offence as he knew what he\n\nwas doing and that it was against the law. He was also found fit to stand trial.9 The victim was now extremely fragile and a pale shadow of her former self. She\n\nwas listed as critically ill for more than four weeks. She had undergone six operations so far and\n\nwould require further surgery and follow-up.10 The Prosecution highlighted four cases of convictions under Section 307(1) of\n\nthe Penal Code (at first instance or on appeal). In three cases, the sentences ranged from 8 years\n\nimprisonment and 6 strokes of the cane to 10 years imprisonment and 12 strokes. In the one instance\n\nwhere life imprisonment was imposed, that sentence was academic in that the accused there was also\n\nsentenced to death for murder in a related charge.THE MITIGATION PLEA11 The Accused is single. He lived alone in a rented room in a HDB flat. His\n\nfather died of cancer in 1964. He is the youngest child out of the eight children in his family and\n\nwas therefore particularly close to his late mother whose death in 1973 affected him greatly. Even\n\nnow, he still dreamt about her. He would visit her grave without fail on the first and fifteenth\n\ndays of each lunar month and also on her birth and death anniversaries.12 After achieving two passes in the GCE O level exams, he performed\n\nNational Service and later worked in several different jobs before settling in the carpet/fabric\n\ntrade in which he worked for more than 15 years. After running his own business for about a year and\n\nfailing, he became an employee again.13 While he was a showroom manager at Interior Showplace Pte Ltd in July/August\n\n1999, he met the victims brother who was very pleased with his performance. The victims\n\nbrother then proposed setting up a company dealing in curtains and fabrics, Interior Fabrics Pte\n\nLtd. There were three directors and shareholders  the Accused, the wife of the victims brother\n\nand the husband of the victim.14 The Accused devoted a lot of time to community work and received good\n\ntestimonials from people he worked with who found him to be helpful, happy, ready to help and\n\nunaggressive.15 The Accused had understood that he would be in charge of the business and that\n\nthe victim and her husband would be answerable to him. After the victim and her husband had picked\n\nup knowledge and experience in the business, the victim started behaving as if she was in control of\n\nthe company, often invoking her brothers name to pressurize the Accused into giving way to her.\n\nThe victim also refused to bear responsibility for her mistakes. All these made the Accused very\n\nupset and disillusioned.16 In one quarrel over a quotation that the victim wished to be written in a\n\ncertain way, the Accused refused to sign it as he did not think it had been done properly. The\n\nvictim then swore at the Accused using vulgarities on his beloved late mother. That shocked and\n\ndistressed the Accused completely.17 About one month before the incident on 21 May 2001, the Accused became\n\ndepressed and upset. He began to feel a great aversion to the office and tried to stay away as much\n\nas possible. The victim would however check on him by calling him frequently on his handphone. She\n\ncriticized his inability to obtain sales and payment, even unilaterally deducting uncollected debts\n\nfrom his salary. She also accused him of taking her wallet which she had left in the office.18 At night, the Accused began to hear his own inner voice telling him to bring\n\nthe victim to see his late mother to apologise to her for the vulgarities uttered against her. He\n\ncould not sleep well and felt very troubled. He considered and began looking for another job.19 He also had constant thoughts of ending his own life. About a week before the\n\nincident, as he was walking along Orchard Road, he suddenly felt like doing so and started walking\n\nten steps away from the pavement, hoping to be run down by traffic. However, he snapped out of it\n\nabruptly, realizing that he would get the driver of the car into trouble.20 On Saturday 19 May 2001, the victim called the Accused to ask why he had not\n\nreported for work when he was attending to a customer elsewhere. She then told the Accused to go to\n\nthe office to sign some documents on Monday 21 May 2001, refusing to explain what the documents\n\nwere.21 That night (19 May 2001), the Accused could not sleep. The inner voice was\n\nurging him to do something quickly and bring the victim to see his late mother to apologise to her.\n\nHe could think of no suitable way to accomplish this except to burn the victim. He knew that there\n\nwas methylated spirit in the office which had been purchased earlier for cleaning the furniture.22 The following night, he had no peace as the inner voice urged him to bring the\n\nvictim quickly as he did not have much time left.23 On the morning of 21 May 2001, he left early for the office carrying two empty\n\nbottles with him. The inner voice was still telling him to carry out the act. In the office, he\n\npoured the methylated spirit which was in a big bottle into the two smaller bottles he had brought\n\nalong so that it would be easier to pour the liquid on the victim. He then walked to the next\n\nbuilding and threw the big bottle away in a dustbin. He then returned to the office to read the\n\nnewspapers.24 Shortly thereafter, the victim and her husband arrived at the office. In a\n\nloud commanding voice, the victim demanded an immediate meeting to discuss certain outstanding debts\n\nowed to the company. The Accused reprimanded the victim for raising her voice, with the victims\n\nhusband supporting him. The victim then demanded explanations from the Accused on some old debts\n\nwhich he had not been able to collect and threw him some accounting documents and asked him to sign\n\nthem. Both the Accused and the victims husband signed. She then demanded a letter from the\n\nAccused explaining his inability to collect the outstanding debts. The meeting ended and the victims\n\nhusband left the office.25 The victim shoved two letterheads at the Accused and ordered him to write\n\nletters to two customers regarding the outstanding payments. She also told him to resign if he was\n\nnot happy. She rang a customer, handed him the telephone and made him ask for the director to\n\nenquire about an outstanding payment. She also made him ring another customer about payment to the\n\ncompany.26 It was this taunting and nagging that got the Accused so upset and angry that\n\nhe, as if in a trance, did what he did to her. After that, he suddenly realized how serious it was.\n\nHe then sat down, took out his handphone and called the police. He also called his sister to tell\n\nher what had happened, that it was because of the victim cursing and scolding their mother using\n\nvulgarities. He waited for the police and surrendered himself when they arrived.27 Defence Counsel tendered a medical report dated 9 November 2001 prepared by Dr\n\nKok Lee Peng, a Consultant Psychiatrist practising at Gleneagles Medical Centre, who examined the\n\nAccused on 4 and 13 July 2001 and 9 November 2001. Dr Kok reported (\"Stella\" refers to the\n\nvictim):\"Diagnosis: Major Depressive EpisodeA Major Depressive Episode is a mood disorder, that in Mr Ngs case was\n\n  characterised by a low, depressed mood, feeling of fatigue and lethargy, poor concentration,\n\n  insomnia, suicidal thoughts and hearing voices talking to him, telling him to bring Stella to see\n\n  his mother.",
        "Progress": "Mr Ng was reviewed by me again on 9 Nov 2001. He appeared well, was not\n\n  depressed or suicidal, said that he was sleeping well and his appetite was fairly good. He did not\n\n  have depressive thoughts, had achieved great peace of mind with the help of Christianity, and\n\n  found solace in praying 5 times daily. He expressed remorse for what he had done, and wished he\n\n  could apologise to Stella. Mr Ng said that he came to realise his blessings  of his faith and\n\n  family support, and in future, if he were to face any difficulties, he would resort to prayer, and\n\n  would seek the advice of his family, instead of keeping things to himself.Mr Ng said that he was still taking medications regularly, and had stopped\n\n  hearing the voices since a month ago.",
        "Opinion": "I am of the opinion that on 21 May 2001 at the time of the alleged offence for\n\n  which he has been charged under Sec 307(1) of the Penal Code, Mr Ng Kwok Soon was suffering from a\n\n  Major Depressive Episode. This mental illness did not however render him to be of such unsoundness\n\n  of mind that he did not know what he was doing or that it was wrong or contrary to law. As a\n\n  result of the Major Depressive Episode, Mr Ng heard imaginary voices talking to him, telling him\n\n  to bring Stella to see his mother so as to apologise to her; he interpreted this to mean that\n\n  Stella had to die and then would apologise to his mother in the afterworld.This Major Depressive Episode started around April 2001. Mr Ng was depressed\n\n  and troubled by insomnia, had constant suicidal thoughts, attempted suicide by walking recklessly\n\n  on the road, heard voices talking to him and thought ceaselessly about bringing Stella to see his\n\n  mother. On the morning of 21 May 2001, he was apparently further aggravated by Stellas remarks.\n\n  He said that he would not have carried out the act that day if he had not been upset, but\n\n  unfortunately, what Stella apparently said made him feel angry and aggrieved, and he carried out\n\n  the act.Since then Mr Ng has been on treatment for his mental illness, and the voices\n\n  have stopped a month ago. He has shown remorse for what he has done, has changed his religious\n\n  belief from Buddhism to Christianity and spends his time in prayer.Mr Ng has responded well to treatment and the voices have stopped since a month\n\n  ago after he has been on treatment for about 5 months. He should be treated with the\n\n  antidepressants for at least a year, after which the medications can be slowly reduced and stopped\n\n  if symptoms of the Major Depressive Episode do not recur. The prognosis in his case is likely to\n\n  be good, as the stress of the unhappy and difficult relationship with Stella will not recur, and\n\n  also because he has very good family support and understands now the importance of confiding in\n\n  his family members if he has any problems in future, and very importantly because he has found\n\n  solace and strength in his new faith ie Christianity and is able to accept whatever fate will mete\n\n  out to him, as he believes that is Gods will. He is very remorseful for what he has done and is\n\n  unlikely to commit such an act in future.At the time of the other 2 offences of criminal breach of trust in August 2000\n\n  and Dec 2000, Mr Ng was not suffering from any mental disorder.Currently he is not of unsound mind and is fit to stand trial.\"28 Defence Counsel also referred to a letter dated 10 October 2001 by Dr Chong\n\nSiow Ann, a Consultant Psychiatrist in Woodbridge Hospital, who was requested to comment on an\n\nearlier report by Dr Kok Lee Peng. Dr Chong said:\"The history that was documented by Dr Kok is consistent with the account\n\n  that the accused had given during his remand period in Woodbridge Hospital. My diagnosis of his\n\n  condition was that he was suffering from depression. In particular, the presence of depressed\n\n  mood, markedly diminished interests, sleep disturbances, fatigue, loss of concentration and\n\n  suicidal ideation would qualified his condition to be a major depressive episode. However, I am\n\n  not convinced that his \"inner voice\" which he said to have experienced was a form of\n\n  auditory hallucination. In view of this, and the absence of other psychotic symptoms like\n\n  delusion, disorganisation of thinking/behaviour, I do not think that the accused had psychotic\n\n  depression.Although his depression might induce a state of \"abnormality of\n\n  mind\", it did not seem to be of that degree as to substantially impair his responsibility for\n\n  his action.\"29 The Accused was deeply remorseful for his actions in putting the victim in so\n\nmuch pain and agony. He came to his senses almost immediately, called the police, surrendered\n\nhimself and made a completely clean breast of things in his statement to the police the next day. He\n\nexpressed the same remorse in his cautioned statement under Section 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure\n\nCode made on 11 June 2001.30 Based on the above and the Accuseds progress and prognosis for his\n\ncondition, it was submitted that \"he clearly falls within the limb of Section 307(1) that\n\nprovides for imprisonment for a term which may extend to 10 years\" and that \"life\n\nimprisonment should not even be considered in this case since the three conditions laid down in the\n\nCourt of Criminal Appeal case ofNeo Man Lee v PP[1991] 2 MLJ 369are not satisfied\".31 Where the Charges under Section 408 of the Penal Code were concerned, the\n\nAccused had made full restitution of the amounts embezzled. Defence Counsel asked that the\n\nimprisonment term for the Second Charge be ordered to run concurrently with that for the Charge\n\nunder Section 307(1) of the Penal Code.THE DECISION OF THE COURT32 As indicated earlier, where \"hurt\" (see Section 319 of the Penal\n\nCode) is caused in attempted murder, the higher tier of punishment may be invoked and that includes\n\nlife imprisonment and caning. In this case, the First Charge went further and specified that\n\n\"grievous hurt\" had been caused. That was justifiable as the injuries in question would\n\ncome within the definitions in Section 320(f) and (h) of the Penal Code. By virtue of Section 231(c)\n\nof the Criminal Procedure Code, no caning could be ordered as the Accused was more than 50 years of\n\nage.33 Cases likeNeo Man Lee v PP[1991] 2 MLJ 369,PP v Ong Wee Teck[2001] 3 SLR 479,PP v Dolah bin Omar[2001] 4 SLR 302andPP v Kwok Teng Soon(CC No.\n\n46 of 2001) all concerned accused persons who were suffering some form of mental illness and who had\n\ncommitted culpable homicide under Section 304(a) of the Penal Code. The accused persons in those\n\ncases were all sentenced to imprisonment for life. However, the guidelines inNeo Man Lee v PPrelating to accused persons of unstable character did not mean that persons not suffering from\n\nmental disorder should not be sentenced to imprisonment for life. One must still examine the acts\n\nconstituting the offence, the motives behind them and their consequences.34 It appeared to me that the Accused here was nothing less than a cold-blooded\n\nwould-be murderer. He had obviously made up his mind to do the dastardly acts when he was leaving\n\nhis home for the office in the early morning of 21 May 2001. He brought two smaller bottles along so\n\nthat it would be easier for him to pour the flammable liquid onto the victim.35 His acts were not the uncontrolled reaction of a person who had been suddenly\n\nassaulted verbally or physically. He was cunning and calculative. He waited for the victims\n\nhusband to leave the scene. He opened the caps of the two bottles containing his medium of\n\ndestruction quietly and approached the victim in stealth. Why did he call her by name? Obviously it\n\nwas to cause her to turn around so that he could incinerate her face and destroy her looks\n\npermanently.36 How did he manage to pour one bottle of flammable liquid on the victims\n\nhead, light a piece of tissue and throw it on her so quickly that she had no time to react? Plainly,\n\nhe had got all his tools ready before he decided to pounce, again showing that all his actions were\n\ndeliberate and premeditated.37 He was not content to see the victim ablaze with the first bottle of liquid.\n\nHe literally added fuel to the fire, as if determined that the flames of his hatred should miss no\n\npart of her body. He was then seen walking in apparent nonchalance behind the terrified victim who\n\nwas crawling out of the office writhing in fiery agony.38 I agree that the present Accused was far removed from the likes ofNeo Man\n\nLeewho were unfortunate to have problems in their heads. Here, the problem of the Accused was\n\nin his heart, clearly a very sadistic and cruel one, fired not by love for his deceased mother but\n\nscorched by hatred for the victim.39 Where the consequences of his wicked acts were concerned, if a picture paints\n\na thousand words, the 12 recent photographs of the victim would constitute a veritable encyclopaedia\n\nof unspeakable sorrow and inexplicable horror.40 Defence Counsel pointed out to me that in two other cases of fiery assaults\n\ndealt with in the Subordinate Courts, the perpetrators of the crimes received 6 years imprisonment\n\nand 12 strokes (PP v See Chai Seng, DAC 43392 of 2000) and 3 years imprisonment (PP v Tan\n\nKim Hock William, MA 38/93/01) respectively. In the last mentioned decision, the original\n\nsentence of 8 months imprisonment was enhanced to 3 years imprisonment by the High Court on appeal\n\nby the Public Prosecutor. Both cases involved offences punishable under Section 326 of the Penal\n\nCode, i.e. voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means. The punishments provided\n\nin Section 326 of the Penal Code are exactly the same as those stipulated in Section 307(1) of the\n\nPenal Code.41 While it is correct that Section 326 of the Penal Code also provides for life\n\nimprisonment, one must not forget that the punishments meted out in those cases were circumscribed\n\nby the sentencing powers of the Subordinate Courts. The Subordinate Courts cannot pass a sentence of\n\nlife imprisonment. A District Court may not ordinarily impose imprisonment terms exceeding 7 years\n\n(Section 11(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code). In any event, what a particular sentence ought to be\n\nin a particular case is determined by its facts.42 On the facts of this case, I had no doubt that the appropriate sentence was\n\none of life imprisonment and I so sentenced the Accused. The Accuseds clean record, his plea of\n\nguilt and his cooperation with the police would have earned him some merit if I could impose caning\n\nas well (and I most certainly would have done so) but, as I have stated, the Accused was not liable\n\nto be caned due to his age.43 Where the Second Charge was concerned, bearing in mind the charge taken into\n\nconsideration, the amounts involved and the fact that full restitution had been made, a term of 6\n\nmonths imprisonment would be appropriate. Because of the life imprisonment imposed, this sentence of\n\n6 months became quite academic as life imprisonment meant incarceration for the remaining natural\n\nlife of the prisoner subject to the possibility of parole after 20 years pursuant to rule 119A of\n\nthe Prisons Regulations. I therefore ordered it to run concurrently with the life imprisonment\n\nsentence deemed to have commenced on 21 May 2001, the date of arrest. If I had decided to impose a\n\nterm other than life imprisonment in respect of the First Charge, I would have ordered the 6 months\n\nimprisonment sentence to run consecutively with that sentence as the two offences in question were\n\ntotally unrelated in time and in nature.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
