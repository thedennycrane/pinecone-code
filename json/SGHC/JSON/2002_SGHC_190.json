        "Background facts": "5        The brief background facts\n\nare that the appellant is a Singaporean PR, originally from Hong Kong. He was employed by\n\nPhilips Electronics Singapore Pte Ltd (\"the Company\") in 1998 as the Regional\n\nService Logistics Manager of Philips Consumer Communications Service (\"PCC\"). In\n\nMarch 2000, the appellant was additionally appointed as Accessories Sales and Marketing\n\nManager, PCC. Donald Puah Boon Leng (\"Donald\"), aged 36, was the Service\n\nDelivery Manager of PCC , responsible for overseeing field data operations. He and the\n\nappellant came into frequent contact during the course of work.6        The appellant was\n\nresponsible for logistic management of service in the Asia Pacific region. This included\n\nthe requisitioning of inventories for either stock support to service centres in the\n\nregion or quality assurance testing.7        The procedure for drawing\n\ninventories is that PCC would need to requisition it from JSI Shipping Pte Ltd\n\n(\"JSI\"), a third party logistics provider for the Company. Any PCC staff could\n\ninitiate the requisition from JSI by giving them a requisition form. When JSI received a\n\nrequisition form, it would send or fax a Picking List to the requestor for confirmation.\n\nUpon return of a signed Picking List by the requestor, JSI would then arrange delivery of\n\nthe goods. A PCC staff who received the goods had to acknowledge receipt on a delivery\n\norder (\"DO\") provided by the JSI’s forwarder. PCC employees in the service\n\nlogistics department reported to the appellant and each of them could requisition for\n\ngoods from JSI.8        All the stocks in\n\nJSI’s warehouse are goods belonging to the Company, which were under the eventual\n\nmanagement responsibility of the appellant, within the scope of his job as Regional\n\nService Logistics Manager. Equally, goods moved from JSI to PCC would also come under the\n\nmanagement responsibility of the appellant, since they came under the management control\n\nof the appellant’s department. Besides the appellant, another person responsible for\n\nthe goods was one MC Wong (\"Wong\"), to whom he reported and who had the overall\n\nresponsibility for service in the Asia Pacific region.",
        "Prosecution’s version": "9        I now move to the\n\ntransactions which are the subject matter of the charges faced by the appellant. Sometime\n\nbetween 1 to 6 May 2000, the appellant had approached Donald in the office and asked him\n\nto find buyers for some transceivers and handphone accessories. The appellant said that\n\nthe goods were ready in JSI and that they were not in the inventory records. Donald and\n\nthe appellant agreed to split the proceeds of the sale equally.10        From 7 to 13 May 2000,\n\nDonald agreed with two persons – Anthony Chia Kin Boon (\"Anthony\"), who had\n\nmet him while working with Motorola, and ‘Johan’, an Indonesian businessman who\n\nhad met Donald when Donald went there for a business trip, to sell them the items as laid\n\nout in Annex B.11        The price and quantities\n\nwere agreed after Donald had consulted with the appellant. Anthony agreed to pay $173,500\n\nand ‘Johan’ agreed to pay $26,500.12        Thereafter, Donald was\n\ninstructed by the appellant to liase with one Agnes Yup Mei Li (\"Agnes\"), an\n\nemployee in PCC who worked under the appellant, regarding the transfer of the needed\n\nquantities of items to PCC from JSI. Donald also got one Teo Eng Chye (\"Teo\"),\n\nwho was employed as an engineering assistant in PCC and reported to Donald, to count and\n\npack the items into smaller cartons and prepare corresponding delivery orders.13        Between 8 May to 17 May\n\n2000, Agnes requisitioned large quantities of transceivers and accessories from JSI on the\n\ninstructions of the appellant. An email dated 8 May 2000 was sent to JSI requesting for 20\n\ntransceivers each of Genie, Xenium 15, Xenium 16 and Savvy to be delivered daily from 8\n\nMay to 12 May 2000, making a total of 80 transceivers in all. A copy of this mail was sent\n\nto the appellant. In addition, she also requested another 100 each of the transceivers\n\nlisted above, making a total of 400 transceivers in all.14        Similarly, Agnes sent\n\nanother email dated 12 May 2000 requesting 100 transceivers each of Genie, Xenium 15,\n\nXenium 16 and Savvy. Added to her earlier requests, that made 800 transceivers in all\n\nrequested from JSI. All the transceivers were delivered by 12 May 2000.15        Agnes also requested for\n\naccessories such as chargers, batteries and user manuals on four separate occasions –\n\n11, 12, 15 and 17 May 2000 via emails. As before, four picking lists were signed by her,\n\nand she acknowledged receipt of the items by signing the delivery orders, save for the\n\nlast delivery order dated 16 May 2000 which was signed by one Fu Yock Buay@Fu XueMei\n\n(\"Charmaine\") on her behalf. Not all accessories ordered were delivered.16        When the requested\n\ntransceivers and accessories arrived, Agnes informed the appellant and was told by him to\n\nhand them over to Donald, who in turn requested that she pass them to Teo for unpacking.17        On 17 May 2000, Donald\n\ncontacted Anthony and asked him to proceed to the Company to collect the items. A Delivery\n\nOrder dated 17 May 2000 was prepared by Teo. The DO was to allow Anthony to be able to\n\ntransport the goods out of the Company. The goods taken were the property of the Company.18        The items were taken out\n\nby Anthony’s assistant. That evening, Donald met Anthony to sort out the\n\ndiscrepancies between what Anthony had brought out and what he had ordered. Donald\n\ntestified that he had earlier removed quantities of some of the ordered items from the\n\nCompany, thus he was able to make up the shortfalls. After settling matters with Anthony,\n\nDonald then delivered the items ordered by \"Johan\" to a member of his staff that\n\nsame night.19        Donald collected the\n\npayment for the goods from ‘Johan’ and Anthony on 21 May 2000 and 22 May 2000\n\nrespectively. Both paid him in cash. After receiving payment from ‘Johan’,\n\nDonald put $10,000 into an envelope, being the appellant’s share of the money, on the\n\nsame night.20        On 23 May 2000, Donald\n\npassed the envelope to the appellant at about 8.30 am. He noticed the appellant putting\n\nthe envelope into his drawer. Later that day, the appellant and Donald were called up for\n\ninternal investigations unrelated to the transactions. The appellant was called up in the\n\nmorning and did not return to his office until 5 – 6 pm. He packed his things and was\n\nthen escorted out of the office. Donald himself was also called up soon after on the same\n\nday and both he and the appellant were subsequently suspended from their duties.21        On 24 May 2000, before he\n\nleft for work in the morning, one Alvin Lim Eng Boon (\"Alvin\"), a former\n\nemployee of PCC, received a call from the appellant. The appellant asked Alvin to help him\n\nretrieve an important document from the drawer of his desk in his office. He also asked\n\nAlvin to get the key from one Ekajanty Alamsjah (\"Eka\"), an employee in the\n\nlogistics department, or Teo since his door was locked. The appellant mentioned that he\n\nand Donald had been suspended.22        Shortly after, Alvin\n\nreceived a call from Donald asking him to meet Donald at the carpark of Toa Payoh Driving\n\nRange after retrieval of the document.23        On arrival at the office,\n\nAlvin told Teo that he needed to retrieve something from the appellant’s office and\n\nasked Teo for the key, which Teo could not provide. He then got the key from Eka. Alvin\n\nwent into the room and retrieved the envelope. He told Eka that he was meeting Donald, and\n\nreturned the key to her.24        While driving to meet\n\nDonald, Alvin opened the envelope and found a thick stack of $1,000 notes. He resealed the\n\nenvelope and then passed it to Donald at Toa Payoh. He did not discuss the incident again\n\nafter that day with anyone.25        Subsequently, on 24\n\nNovember 2000, the appellant called Alvin and asked him not to tell the Commercial Affairs\n\nDepartment (CAD) that he saw cash in the envelope. Alvin refused. He received a few more\n\ncalls from the appellant that morning, but refused to pick it up after one or two times.\n\nLater that evening, the appellant called Alvin again. They subsequently met up at White\n\nSands, Pasir Ris, where the appellant again asked Alvin not to reveal that Alvin had\n\nretrieved the envelope filled with cash. Alvin refused and left. The appellant was\n\nsubsequently charged with the present offences.",
        "Appellant’s version": "26        The appellant denied all\n\ninvolvement in the transaction and disputes many of the facts above. He claimed that he\n\nhad relinquished his post as Service Logistics Manager at the relevant time and further\n\nthat there was a conspiracy to frame him.27        He denied approaching\n\nDonald in the office to suggest that they sell the goods. With regards to the ordering of\n\ngoods by Agnes, the appellant denied having ever given her such instructions.28        The appellant claimed no\n\nknowledge of the existence of the envelope in his office. He claimed that he had locked\n\nhis drawers on 23 May 2000. He further denied making any calls to Alvin on 24 November\n\n2000. According to him, he had bumped into Alvin on that day in the evening and they had\n\nchatted for a while.",
        "The discrepancy in quantities": "29        I digress here to\n\nhighlight a key feature in this case, which is the discrepancy between the quantities of\n\ngoods ordered by Agnes and delivered by JSI and the quantities of these goods eventually\n\nsold to Anthony and \"Johan\". In the proceedings below, this discrepancy was\n\npointed to repeatedly by counsel for the appellant and it was again raised on appeal as\n\ncasting doubt on the prosecution’s version of events.30        The quantities of certain\n\nitems delivered by JSI in response to Agnes’ request did not match what Donald sold\n\nto Anthony and \"Johan\" in certain cases. Nor did the quantities correspond to\n\nthe DO prepared by Teo. This is set out in the table below:S/NoDescriptionOrdered by AgnesDelivered by JSIDOSold to AnthonySold to \"Johan\"1Genie transceivers2002006427002X15 transceivers200200402003X16 transceivers200200402004X15/X16 chargers4804804004005X15/X16 batteries3803804004006Savvy C12 transceiver200200402007Savvy C12 chargers3003001284008Savvy C12/C13 manuals11110069699Savvy C12 batteries1007020020031        As can be seen, the\n\nquantities listed in DO were more than what was delivered in some cases and less in\n\nothers. The quantities also showed divergence from the amount sold to Anthony and\n\n\"Johan\" and those ordered by Agnes and delivered by JSI.32        Neither Donald nor Agnes\n\nwere able to explain where the excess goods not ordered by her came from. The differences\n\nin quantities affected the charge fundamentally, since the prosecution evidence proved\n\nonly that the appellant was entrusted with dominionover Philips goods stored in JSI.\n\nHence, at first instance, the prosecution was ordered to amend the charges to reflect the\n\nfact that only the quantities of each item ordered by Agnes could be reflected in the\n\ncharge against the appellant. Any other goods in excess of what was ordered by Agnes (in\n\nterms of quantity) sold by Donald to Anthony and \"Johan\" were deleted from the\n\nparticulars of the charge.",
        "Decision of the trial judge": "33        The learned trial judge\n\nmade the following findings of fact:",
        "The appellant was the Service Logistics Manager at the time": "34        The trial judge relied in\n\nmaking this finding on the evidence of both Charmaine and Ng Lu Ping (\"Lu\n\nPing\"), who was the Assistant Service Logistics Manager in PCC, who were unequivocal\n\nthat the appellant was still the boss in the logistics department and that they still\n\nreported to him.35        The appellant was also\n\nunable to provide any evidence of his relinquishment of position, save for the testimony\n\nof one Linda Tan Leng Leng (\"Linda\"),who was not\n\neven an employee of PCC.",
        "The appellant was entrusted with dominion over Philips’ goods\n\nstored in JSI": "36        The trial judge relied on\n\nthe evidence of Alan Sparks (\"Sparks\"), the Senior Vice President of PCC, Asia\n\nPacific to arrive at this finding. Sparks gave evidence to the effect that in his capacity\n\nas Service Logistics Manager, the appellant had eventual responsibility for the goods in\n\nJSI and their movement. She further found that this would fulfil the requirement of\n\nexercise of dominion.",
        "There was a conspiracy to sell goods belonging to Philips, stored in\n\nJSI, which the appellant abetted": "37        The trial judge found\n\nDonald’s version of the events to be credible and cogent, as well as supported in\n\nvarious aspects by evidence from other witnesses such as Anthony, Agnes, Teo and Alvin.\n\nShe therefore found, in reliance on Donald’s evidence, that the appellant had abetted\n\nDonald by conspiring with him to sell the goods belonging to Philips which were entrusted\n\nto his dominion.",
        "That the goods delivered were the same ones that had been delivered\n\nfrom JSI": "38        The appellant had argued\n\nthat the discrepancies in quantity and evidence given by Donald and Anthony suggesting\n\nthat the goods sold were not new meant a break in the chain of evidence linking the goods\n\nsold to those under the appellant’s dominion. As already mentioned, the particulars\n\nof the charges were amended in response to this problem.39        In coming to her finding,\n\nthe trial judge found that Donald’s and Anthony’s evidence were not conclusive\n\nas to whether the goods were new or not. She also relied on evidence given by both Donald\n\nand Teo that prior batches of goods ordered by Agnes were packed and removed before 17 May\n\n2000, which could explain the difference in quantities between what was listed in DO and\n\nwhat was sold. As to goods whose quantities ordered were in excess of that listed in the\n\nDO, the trial judge accepted on Teo’s evidence that there were excess goods still\n\nlying around the office after 17 May 2000.",
        "There was no conspiracy between Donald, Agnes, Teo and Alvin to frame\n\nthe accused": "40        The trial judge dismissed\n\nthis part of the appellant’s defence as without basis in fact.",
        "The appeal": "41        The appellant appealed\n\nagainst his conviction on the following grounds: a) that entrustment of dominion as stated\n\nin the charge had not been proven by the prosecution; b) that the property over which he\n\nhad been entrusted with dominion had not been proven to be the same property that was sold\n\nto Anthony and \"Johan\"; and c) that the credibility of prosecution witnesses was\n\nsuspect and a conviction based on their evidence was unsafe. I shall deal with them each\n\nin turn.",
        "Entrustment of dominion not proven by prosecution": "42        This ground of defence had\n\nalready been put before the judge at first instance, and was rejected.43        The argument revolves\n\naround two aspects – factual and legal. The factual aspect is whether at the material\n\ntime of the offences the appellant was still holding on to his position as a Service\n\nLogistics Manager; corollary to this is whether the responsibility of such a position\n\nentailed management responsibility over the relevant goods.44        The legal aspect is on\n\nwhether management responsibility for the goods could be equated to entrustment of\n\ndominion over them. It was also the submission of counsel for the appellant that sole\n\ndominion was necessary for the purposes of criminal breach of trust.45        With regards to the first\n\naspect, the trial judge had found that the appellant had not relinquished his position at\n\nthe time the offences were committed. Evidence given by all of the employees of PCC at the\n\ntrial confirmed that the appellant was still acting as Service Logistics Manager then,\n\ndespite his added appointment in March 2000. His argument that his duties had been\n\nrelinquished to Lu Ping was facetious since clear evidence was given by Lu Ping and Agnes\n\nthat they still reported to the appellant. The only evidence to support the\n\nappellant’s contention was given by an employee of JSI, an outsider. I found that the\n\ntrial judge was plainly right in her finding.46        The appellant also\n\nquestioned the accuracy of Spark’s evidence on the responsibilities of Service\n\nLogistics Manager since Sparks was not certain in other parts of his evidence. This, in my\n\nview, is totally without merit. Sparks was clear and firm in his description of the\n\nappellant’s job scope. His uncertainty was only with regard to his memory of recent\n\nchanges in appointments within PCC.47        As to the legal aspect,\n\nthe question to be answered is whether the appellant could be said to be entrusted with\n\ndominion over the goods simply because he had management responsibility for them, and, if\n\nso, whether sole dominion over the goods was a necessary element of criminal breach of\n\ntrust.48        InCriminal Law in\n\nSingapore and Malaysia (Koh, Clarkson and Morgan, 1989), the learned authors\n\nopined at page 588 that \"the factor which effectively determines whether there is\n\nentrustment …… of dominion is the degree of control exercised by the\n\naccused\".49        InBirmala Charan Roy(1913) 35 All 361, a water inspector who was under a duty to check and supervise the\n\ndistribution of water from the water works was held to have dominion over the water\n\nbelonging to his employers. Further, inState of Rajasthan v Kesar Singh[1969] Cri\n\nL J 1595, the court held that where a person had dominion in the sense of \"general\n\ncontrol and supervision\" over property entrusted to him in his position as an\n\nemployee, he could be liable for criminal breach of trust if he misappropriated the\n\nproperty or was party to a criminal breach of trust by another person.50        Both the above cases\n\nplainly support the proposition that a general degree of control can amount to dominion\n\nover a property.51        I turn next to consider\n\nwhether sole dominion is necessary for an offence of criminal breach of trust to be made\n\nout. Such a requirement does not appear within the provision itself. InCriminal Law in\n\nSingapore and Malaysia,the authors stated that it is possible to convict an accused\n\nfor criminal breach of trust even if there is concurrently another person in overall\n\ncontrol of the operations or day-to-day running of operations.52        InKesar Singhitself,\n\nthe accused was an employee of a palace with supervisory power over its staff and affairs.\n\nThe alleged offence was in relation to grain stocks not under his direct control. Another\n\nemployee was in charge of the delivery and receipt of grain, but had to tender a report to\n\nthe accused on each delivery or receipt of grain, which the accused would endorse. The\n\ngrain was found to be short and the accused was charged with criminal breach of trust.53        Although the accused was\n\nfound not guilty in that case, this was due solely to the fact that there was a lack of\n\nevidence connecting him to the pilferage of the grain. As such, the case shows clearly\n\nthat sole dominion is not a necessary condition to establishing criminal breach of trust.54        In my opinion, this is\n\nplainly right. The essence of the offence lies in the entrustment of property to an\n\nemployee and his subsequent betrayal of that trust. Whether or not there is sole dominion\n\nover the property is irrelevant; what is important is only the fact that the trust was\n\nbreached, and this is so equally whether or not dominion of the property was entrusted\n\nsolely to a specific employee or to a number of employees, one of whom subsequently\n\nmisappropriates the property. It would be ludicrous to say that the latter could not have\n\ncommitted criminal breach of trust simply by reason of the fact that others werealsoentrusted with dominion over said property.55        On the facts of the case,\n\nthe job scope of the appellant clearly involved supervisory and general control over the\n\ngoods stored in JSI. He could request for the goods whenever he wanted and have it sent\n\nwhere ever he wished. He was responsible for their movements and was the overall head of\n\nthe department which managed the movement of the goods – the logistics department.56        Based on the foregoing, I\n\naccordingly found that once the fact of the appellant’s position as Service Logistics\n\nManager was established at the material time of the transactions, entrustment of dominion\n\nover the relevant property was established.",
        "Property entrusted with dominion over was not the same property which\n\nwas misappropriated": "57        It was argued by the\n\nappellant that that there was a break in the chain of evidence to show that the goods the\n\nappellant was entrusted with dominion over was not the same as those sold by Donald. He\n\nrelied on evidence given by Donald and Anthony to the effect that the subject matter of\n\nthe transactions were second-hand refurbished phones. Teo, who had packed the goods for\n\nsale, also admitted under cross-examination that he was unsure if the goods were new. The\n\nlearned trial judge had accepted that the goods ordered by Agnes for the purposes of the\n\ntransactions were all brand new.58        The trial judge dismissed\n\nthis as neither Donald nor Anthony had actually examined all the goods sold. She found\n\nthat Anthony’s belief that the goods were second-hand came solely from his\n\nconversation with Donald when negotiating the transaction and prices. Agnes had given all\n\nthe goods she received to Teo, who had packed them personally. Donald’s evidence on\n\nthe goods being second-hand was in the context of the prices that he had negotiated for\n\nthem, that is, the price he had sold the goods at were the prices a second-hand version of\n\nthe goods would fetch. It is highly plausible that Donald told Anthony the goods were\n\nsecond-hand in order to alleviate any suspicions of illegality Anthony might have.59        Teo had given evidence\n\nthat, from what he could see, the goods were new. He also gave evidence that goods given\n\nto him by Agnes were packed by him into cartons, and he personally witnessed the delivery\n\nof the carton of goods to Anthony on 17 May 2000. The trial judge had found that the goods\n\nsold by Donald were the same as those over which the appellant had been entrusted\n\ndominion. Having examined the evidence, I see no reason to conclude that she had clearly\n\nreached a wrong decision.",
        "The credibility of prosecution witnesses was suspect and a conviction\n\nbased on their evidence was unsafe": "60        The crux of this\n\nsubmission was that the reliability of the evidence given by three prosecution witnesses\n\n– Donald, Agnes and Alvin; was suspect.",
        "Donald’s evidence": "61        Donald’s evidence\n\ndirectly implicated the appellant in the conspiracy. The defence challenged his\n\ncredibility on many grounds, which include:i It is implausible that the appellant would have approached him to\n\n  suggest the conspiracy since they were not on close terms.ii Donald’s evidence that the appellant approached him in the\n\n  office to suggest the conspiracy from 1 to 6 May 2000 was implausible since there was only\n\n  one day during that period when this would have been possible.iii It is highly likely on the evidence that Donald could have\n\n  fulfilled the transactions on his owniv Donald’s evidence was riddled with other inconsistencies which\n\n  rendered his evidence suspect.v That the fact of Donald being an accomplice coupled with the many\n\n  inconsistencies in his evidence meant that he should be presumed unworthy of credit via\n\n  exercise of the court’s discretion under s116(b) of the Evidence Act (Cap. 97)62        These had all been argued\n\nbefore the trial judge, who rejected all of these contentions. I agree with her findings.\n\nDonald’s job scope enabled him to travel widely and meet many people, a fact known to\n\nthe appellant. Thus it was not unlikely that he should have been chosen. The appellant\n\nwould also have known Donald well enough to seize him up and have an idea of his\n\nsuitability as a partner in crime, given that they had been colleagues for over a year.63        I found the submission in\n\n(ii) to be totally without merit. Donald’s recollection of the appellant’s\n\napproach was clear and unambiguous. The appellant’s absence from office during five\n\nof the six days in the period simply meant that he must have approached Donald in the\n\noffice on the day he was present, which was 3 May 2000. This by itself does not cast any\n\nreasonable doubt on Donald’s testimony, especially since there was no evidence that\n\nthe appellant could not have approached Donald on that day.64        With regard to\n\nDonald’s ability to perform the transactions on his own, the evidence clearly showed\n\nthat Donald did not have the power to requisition such large quantities of goods as for\n\nthe transaction. Only with the appellant’s, or someone from the logistics department,\n\nhelp would the goods have been able to be requisitioned. Furthermore, there was also\n\nindependent evidence which implicated the appellant in the transactions.65        The appellant had sought\n\nto use the discrepancy in quantities which I have highlighted earlier to support his\n\ncontention that Donald was engaged in his own private dealings and that his allegations\n\nagainst the appellant were false. However, I was of the opinion that the problems raised\n\nby the discrepancy had already been fully dealt with by the trial judge in her findings\n\nand I saw no reason to disturb them.66        Various other\n\ninconsistencies were raised, all of which were fully dealt with by the trial judge in\n\ncoming to her decision.I could see no fault in her finding\n\nthat Donald’s evidence was generally cogent, believable and supported by evidence\n\nfrom other prosecution witnesses.67        With regard to the\n\nsubmission in (v), the trial judge had borne in mind provision 116(b) of the Evidence Act\n\n(Cap 97) when she scrutinised the Donald’s evidence and explicitly cautioned herself\n\nas to this fact. InJimina Jacee d/o CD Athananasius v PP[2000] 2 SLR 205, I held\n\nthat s116(b) of the Evidence Act did not mean that an accomplice’s evidencemustbe\n\npresumed to be unworthy of credit. The correct approach should be:Whether or not the accomplice’s evidence is reliable will depend\n\n  on all the circumstance of each case.All that the court is required to do is to\n\n  scrutinise such evidence carefully[italics added]68        In the present case, the\n\ntrial judge had correctly directed herself in examining Donald’s evidence.\n\nFurthermore, the fact that Donald had already been charged and sentenced for his part in\n\nthe transactions was another factor for believing in the truth of his evidence. The\n\ndefence contention that Donald’s testimony was inherently improbable is\n\nunsupportable, and I found their suggestion that he had fabricated his evidence to get a\n\nlighter sentence by minimising his role without any merit, especially since Donald freely\n\nadmitted to playing a major part in the transactions.69        Furthermore, Donald’s\n\nevidence was supported in many respects by evidence of other witnesses. For instance, his\n\ndescription of the arrangement for collecting the goods for sale pursuant to his agreement\n\nwith the appellant was supported by both Agnes and Teo. The strongest supporting evidence\n\nfor the existence of the conspiracy comes from the evidence of Alvin in his narration of\n\nthe phone calls to him by the appellant, requesting for his aid in covering up evidence of\n\nthe appellant’s wrong-doing. In view of all this, I found that the trial judge was\n\ncorrect in accepting the evidence of Donald and relying on it to prove the existence of\n\nthe conspiracy.",
        "Agnes’ evidence": "70        Evidence provided by Agnes\n\nhelped linked the appellant to the goods which were sold. Agnes gave evidence that the\n\ngoods were all ordered on the instructions of the appellant; this, coupled with Teo’s\n\nevidence that the goods sold were taken from Agnes, as well as the correspondence of the\n\nitems ordered to those sold, clearly implicated the appellant.71        The trial judge had found\n\nthat Agnes was edgy and had difficulty in expressing herself. Although there were material\n\ndiscrepancies in evidence given by Agnes, these related to other incidents in the sequence\n\nof events leading to the transaction, for example, Agnes had stated that she kept the\n\ndelivered goods in a locked cupboard. This was contradicted, however, by Teo and\n\nCharmaine, both of whom asserted that the goods were lying around.72        With regards to her\n\nevidence on the appellant’s instructions, however, Agnes’ was found by the trial\n\njudge to be reliable. In respect of both her ordering of the goods and the communications\n\nwith Donald, the trial judge found that Agnes was clear that she was acting on the\n\nappellant’s instructions. This was consistently held to by her despite vigorous\n\ncross-examination.73        InPP v Gan Lim Soon[1993] 3 SLR 261, the court stated:As with so many cases, where the lapse of time has caused memories to\n\n  blur and fade, and result in throwing up many discrepancies in evidence, it is vitally\n\n  important that courts do not lose sight of the wood for the trees.InNg Kwee Leong v PP[1998] 3 SLR 942, I also held that a court\n\ncan decide to accept one part of a witness’ testimony while rejecting the other.74        Applying this approach, I\n\nfound nothing wrong in relying on Agnes’ evidence in part. The actual dates and\n\ncircumstances of the appellant giving instructions to her are immaterial; what was\n\nimportant was that these instructions were in fact given. On this, Agnes’ evidence\n\nwas cogent and reliable. The fact that she had copied one of her emails ordering the goods\n\nto the appellant lends more weigh to her testimony, as he would surely have suspected\n\nsomething was amiss if he had truly not been involved in the transactions. I found it hard\n\nto believe the appellant’s explanation that he had not seen the email. The same\n\napproach was adopted by the trial judge, who relied only on the parts of Agnes’\n\nevidence which proved that the goods were ordered on orders from the appellant. She was\n\nentitled to do so.",
        "Alvin’s evidence": "75        Alvin’s evidence\n\nconcerning the envelope containing the money is strong circumstantial evidence of the\n\nappellant’s involvement in the conspiracy, as well as supporting Donald’s\n\nversion of events.76        In relation to the\n\nretrieval of the envelope, Alvin’s version of events was corroborated in various\n\naspects by Eka, Teo and Lu Ping. The defence’s suggestion that the envelope was\n\nplanted is far fetched as Donald would have had to know some six months in advance (he was\n\ninvestigated for these offences in November 2000) that the transactions would be found\n\nout.77        Further, when coupled with\n\nthe evidence of the phone calls by the appellant, I found that a strong inference arises\n\nof the appellant’s guilt.78        The appellant denied ever\n\nmaking the alleged phone calls to Alvin. He pointed out that Alvin’s phone records on\n\n24 May 2000, when he claims the appellant called him numerous times to ask for his help,\n\nshowed no trace of the appellant’s handphone number.79        The trial judge accepted\n\nthat the appellant called from an unregistered number – marked as\n\n\"ex-directory\" in the phone records. I examined the evidence, and in my opinion\n\nshe was right in finding this part of Alvin’s evidence to be credible.80        Counsel for the appellant\n\nargued strenuously that Alvin’s readiness to assist Donald and the appellant in\n\nretrieving the envelope, even though he had known or must have suspected there something\n\nwas amiss, was not normal behaviour. The appellant’s counsel further pointed out that\n\neven after Alvin opened the envelope and saw the money, he continued to keep in contact\n\nwith Donald on a regular basis. It was submitted that these actions when viewed together\n\ncast doubt on Alvin’s portrayal of himself as an innocent party to the transactions\n\nin this case, and hence his credibility should be suspect as well.81        I found this submission to\n\nbe without merit. The only way Alvin’s evidence can be excluded would be if one were\n\nto accept that he was part of a plot to frame the accused. However, the appellant could\n\nnot offer any reason why Alvin would wish to frame him. Furthermore, the Alvin’s\n\nretrieval of the envelope (on 24 May 2000) happened a full six months before the appellant\n\nand Donald were investigated in relation to transactions in issue (24 November 2000). It\n\nis hard to imagine that a plot to frame the appellant would have been hatched so long\n\nbeforehand. The trial judge had already found Alvin to be a reliable witness. Having\n\nconsidered the above factors, I found that she was entitled to rely on Alvin’s\n\nevidence.",
        "Alleged conspiracy": "82        The appellant suggested\n\nthe existence of a plot to frame him, involving Donald, Teo, Agnes and Alvin. He raised\n\nthe following points in support:i That he had had a few incidents at work in which unhappiness arose\n\n  between him and Donald – in particular, the appellant had once told Donald that he\n\n  would be laid off if Donald went for an operation. According to the appellant, Donald had\n\n  thought he was lying and swore to \"get him\" if he was. The appellant alleges\n\n  that this caused Donald to bear a grudge against him.ii That Agnes bore a grudge against him as he was a harsh taskmaster\n\n  and had once scolded her to tears.iii That there was general ill-will towards him as he was from Hong\n\n  Kong and a harsh taskmaster83        These allegations were\n\ndismissed by the trial judge. She found the appellant’s version of events to be\n\nunsubstantiated. Donald denied that he had a grudge against the appellant, and Agnes\n\ndenied that the incident in (ii) even occurred. She found the third ground to be without\n\nany basis in fact.84        In my opinion, the\n\nappellant’s allegation here is plainly fallacious. Supporting evidence pointing to\n\nthe appellant’s guilt in some fashion or another had been given by other prosecution\n\nwitnesses. To suggest that Donald could have planned such an intricate web of deception\n\nbeggars belief, and the trial judge was right in dismissing this.",
        "Conclusion": "85        It is settled law that an\n\nappellate court should be slow to disturb a trial judge’s finding of fact. Reference\n\ncan be made toPP v Victor Rajoo s/o Pitchay Muthu[1995] 3 SLR 417, where the\n\nCourt of Appeal stated:The learned trial judge, who had the benefit of seeing\n\n  and hearing the complainant and the accused giving evidence made findings of fact based on\n\n  the veracity and credibility of their respective evidence. Due regard must be given to the\n\n  learned judge’s findings, and such findings should not be disturbed unless we are\n\n  satisfied that he has clearly reached a wrong decision.Having reviewed all the evidence, I see no reason for me to conclude\n\nthat the trial judge has clearly reached a wrong decision. She had the opportunity to\n\nobserve the demeanour of all the relevant witnesses in trial, and there is nothing to\n\nsuggest to me that her findings were wrong in any way.86        For the reasons stated\n\nabove, I dismissed the appeal against conviction.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
