        "Adverse possession": "7 The defendants were not represented by\n\ncounsel. But counsel for the plaintiffs, Miss Hong, in the best tradition of the Bar,\n\npresented her clients' case fairly and provided me with invaluable support in relation to\n\nthe authorities that might favour the defendants.8 The first consideration is whether the\n\ndefendants might have acquired any title to the Land by adverse possession. There is some\n\nevidence that the defendants, or their predecessors-in-title, had been using the Land\n\nsince 1961 for access, parking and for their business much in the same manner as they are\n\nusing it today. Although such evidence was not given by way of formal affidavit, Miss Hong\n\ndid not dispute it. The plaintiffs came into the picture after the vendors developed\n\nAlexandra Centre and the management corporation was constituted in 1982. Up to that time\n\nno action was taken by the vendors against the defendants or their predecessors-in-title\n\nin respect of their use of the Land. Even after 1982, the plaintiffs did not take any\n\naction until shortly before this summons was filed in December 1999. In the affidavit\n\nfiled by Tan Kok Peng (\"Tan\") on behalf of the plaintiffs, Tan deposed that the\n\nLand was being used by the defendants to the exclusion of the plaintiffs. Hence the\n\ndefendants had been using the Land continuously in this manner to the exclusion of the\n\nplaintiffs for almost 40 years.9 There may have been other impediments to\n\na claim in adverse possession, but an inquiry as to that is rendered unnecessary by virtue\n\nof the Land Titles Act. This is because the defendants had not taken out any application\n\nunder section 172(8) of that Act. Any title they might have been able to claim had been\n\nremoved by operation of section 50, which provides as follows:50. Except as provided in section 172(8)\n\n  and (9), no title to land adverse to or in derogation of the title of a proprietor of\n\n  registered land shall be acquired by any length of possession by virtue of the Limitation\n\n  Act or otherwise, nor shall the title of any proprietor of registered land be extinguished\n\n  by the operation of that Act.Section 172(8) obliges a person to make\n\nhis claim in adverse possession by 1 September 1984. The defendants had not made any claim\n\nat all and section 50 of the Act would now exclude such a claim.",
        "Prescription": "10 The second consideration is whether any\n\neasement had been acquired by prescription on the basis of the doctrine of lost modern\n\ngrant. This doctrine applies in Singapore in respect of unregistered land - seeXpress\n\nPrint v Monocrafts Pte Ltd & Anor(Unreported) Civil Appeal No. 202/1999 (24 July\n\n2000) at paragraph 36. In the present case there is some evidence that the defendants had\n\nbeen using the Land to park their vehicles since their units were completed in 1960 or\n\n1961, i.e. almost 40 years before the plaintiffs took out this action. If the defendants\n\nhad been doing this for a period of 20 years before the Land was brought under the\n\nprovisions of the Land Titles Act, they could have acquired an easement over it. Such an\n\neasement would not be affected by the subsequent conversion to registered land because\n\nsection 46 provides that such land is held subject to any subsisting easement.11 However, from the Certificate of Title\n\nit can be seen that a qualified Certificate of Title was issued on 6 November 1978.\n\nTherefore the requisite 20 years would not have elapsed since the defendants' units were\n\nonly completed around 1960. Once the Land has become registered land, no easement can be\n\nacquired by prescription by virtue of section 97 of the Land Titles Act. Accordingly,\n\nthere could not have been an easement acquired by prescription.",
        "Indenture": "12 The remaining question is the scope of\n\nthe easement granted in the indenture. The plaintiffs exhibited the deeds of indenture in\n\nrespect of all the defendants' units. They are similar in nature and I reproduce below a\n\ntypical indenture, which relates to one of the first-storey units:THIS INDENTURE is made the 24th day of\n\n  October One thousand nine hundred and sixty two (1962) Between ASIA TRUST &\n\n  DEVELOPMENT LIMITED, a Company incorporated in the State of Singapore and having its\n\n  registered office at Netherlands Trading Society Building, Cecil Street, Singapore\n\n  (hereinafter called the Vendors) of the one part and LOK BOK SIM of No. 3 Astrid Hill,\n\n  Singapore, Company Director (hereinafter called the Purchaser) of the other part.WHEREAS the Vendors are seised for an\n\n  estate in fee simple free from incumbrances of the lands and premises described in the\n\n  First Schedule hereto and have agreed to convey an undivided moiety or equal half share\n\n  thereof to the Purchaser in consideration of the Covenants hereinafter appearing and of\n\n  the Purchaser having already taken a Lease for 9999 years of the ground floor of the\n\n  Building erected thereon.NOW THIS INDENTURE WITNESSETH as follows:I.

Commercial Bank\n\n      Limited of the one part and the Vendors of the other part.13 It can be seen from this indenture that\n\nan undivided half share of the land in fee simple was conveyed to the purchaser of the\n\nunit who had also taken a lease on the first-storey of the building for 9,999 years. The\n\nother undivided half share of the land was conveyed to the purchaser who had taken a\n\nsimilar lease on the second-storey of that building. The First Schedule to the indenture\n\ndescribes the land in question and the interest conveyed. This comprises the land upon\n\nwhich the building is built and includes the rights described in the words underlined\n\nabove.14 Miss Hong agreed that those words\n\nrelate to the grant of an easement, the dominant tenement being the land the subject of\n\nthe indenture, i.e. the land on which the particular unit is built. The servient tenement\n\nis described in the indenture as\"the Service Road\"and the\"open\n\nspace\"coloured brown in the plan annexed to the indenture. It is not clear from\n\nthe copies of the indenture exhibited exactly what were coloured brown. But the plaintiffs\n\nwere prepared to concede that this refers to the Land. The plaintiffs agree that the sole\n\nquestion for determination is the scope of this easement.15 Before making this determination, it is\n\nnecessary to set out the following facts by way of background. The conveyances of the\n\ndefendants' units were made in 1961 and 1962. The government had since acquired a part of\n\nthe original land, apparently for widening of Alexandra Road. Indeed, it was because this\n\nor a later widening exercise caused the loss of parking space along Alexandra Road\n\npreviously enjoyed by the plaintiffs' subsidiary proprietors that prompted them to take\n\nout this action. Therefore for almost 40 years, from 1960 to 1999, the defendants had\n\nenjoyed continuous, uninterrupted use of the Land.16 From the survey plan exhibited by the\n\nplaintiffs, it can be seen that the front of the defendants' buildings were constructed\n\nright up to the boundary line of the Land. This means that the defendants' units are\n\nlandlocked and the only means of access to the public thoroughfare, Alexandra Road, was\n\nthrough the Land. The plan annexed to the indenture shows a private service road built on\n\nthe Land. In front of the defendants' units this service road makes a full loop around an\n\nunpaved oval area. There appears to be no provision for parking of vehicles apart from\n\nparallel parking along the service road. In the course of the submissions, one of the\n\ndefendants said that at that time their cars were parked along the service road. However\n\nthis evidence was not made on affidavit although Miss Hong did not object to nor dispute\n\nit. Nevertheless, it is an inference that can be readily drawn from the circumstances and\n\nI so infer.17 The defendants produced some evidence\n\nthat in 1977 they had been asked by the vendors, who at the time were the proprietors of\n\nthe Land, to contribute a sum of money towards the repair and upkeep of the service road.\n\nThe defendants also claimed that they had, since the conveyance of their units, been\n\npaying for the maintenance and upkeep of the Land. Again this was not by way of affidavit,\n\nbut this was not denied by the plaintiffs. In any event, there is covenant in clause II(i)\n\nof the indenture binding each defendant to contribute a fair sum for the maintenance of\n\nthe service road which would be consistent with the defendants' assertions.18 There is a further point in respect of\n\nclause II(i) of the indenture. For convenience, I set it out again. It covenants the\n\nproprietor:To contribute from time to time a fair and\n\n  rateable proportion of the cost of maintaining and keeping in repair the Service Road\n\n  marked Private Lot 396 and coloured brown in the said plan annexed and also all culverts\n\n  pipes cables or water drains now or hereafter on or under the Estate the proportion in\n\n  case of difference to be ascertained at the option of the Vendor by an arbitrator or\n\n  arbitrators appointed for that purpose in terms of the Arbitration Ordinancebut only\n\n  until the same are taken over and maintained by the Singapore City Council or other\n\n  competent authority.The service road and Private Lot 396\n\nmentioned in this covenant relates to the Land. The words underlined suggest an intention\n\non the part of the vendors to eventually surrender, among other things, the service road\n\nto the local authority for the latter to take over and maintain it. As it has turned out,\n\nthis was not done and shortly before 1982, the vendors developed Alexandra Centre of which\n\nthe Land forms a part.19 In any event it appears that part of\n\nthe original land was compulsorily acquired by the government for the widening of\n\nAlexandra Road. What remained after acquisition comprises the Land, which became reduced\n\nin area by about 45%. As a consequence of this the looped service road no longer exists.\n\nIn its place, the unpaved oval area appears to have been paved over and is being used for\n\nboth access to the defendants' units and the parking of their vehicles.20 It is in this context that I have to\n\ndecide the scope of the easement granted in the indenture. Miss Hong agreed that the\n\ndetermination in respect of one indenture would apply in respect of the 13 other\n\nindentures.21 Firstly it is clear that the easement\n\ncannot operate to exclude the plaintiffs, the proprietor of the servient tenement, from\n\nthe use of their land. Accordingly, I made declarations (i) and (v). Secondly, it is also\n\nclear that the expression\"to pass and repass with or without … motor cars\n\nand other vehicles\"grants a right of way whether on foot or by vehicles. Hence\n\ndeclaration (iv) was made.22 The remaining questions are whether the\n\ndefendants are entitled (a) to store their goods on the Land, which is the subject of\n\ndeclaration (ii), and (b) to park their vehicles on the Land, the subject of declaration\n\n(iii). I first deal with the issue of parking.23 Miss Hong does not dispute that the\n\nright to park vehicles can be the subject of an easement. Her point is that this is not\n\nstated in the indenture and was therefore not part of the rights granted therein. Although\n\nit is true that it is not specifically stated in the indenture that the grantee had the\n\nright to park vehicles on the Land, I was of the view that the words in the indenture\"to\n\nenjoy the open space\", in the context of the rest of the indenture as well as the\n\ncircumstances at the time of the grant, are sufficient to include the right to park\n\nvehicles. My reasons are as follows. It is not clear whether the defendants' units were\n\nsold before construction was underway or only after completion. But even if there were no\n\nstructures at the time of sale, the purchasers would have seen a model of the development\n\nor, at the very least, a drawing of the site. They would have noticed the provision of the\n\nservice road, and the fact that apart from this access road there would be no other means\n\nof access to the units and no other place to park their vehicles. The first storey units\n\nwere sold as shophouses and the second storey units as apartments for dwelling as provided\n\nin clause II(ii) of the indenture. As is common today, it is likely that the question of\n\nvehicular parking would have been on the minds of the purchasers. In fact clause II(i) of\n\nthe indenture obliges the proprietor to contribute towards maintenance of the service road\n\nand appears to state that this service road would eventually be handed to the local\n\nauthority for maintenance. As it turned out, this was not only not done, but the Land was\n\nsubsequently conveyed to the plaintiffs as part of the land comprised in Alexandra Centre.\n\nAlthough there is no evidence of the state of the adjoining Alexandra Road at the time, it\n\nwould not be difficult to imagine that parking would be envisaged along the service road\n\nif it were wide enough. Such evidence as is available before me seems to indicate that it\n\nwas and that vehicles were in fact parked on it. Finally, in developing Alexandra Centre\n\nwith both Lot 2059L and the Land, the vendors had obtained the benefit of the Land even\n\nthough it is stated in clause II(i) of the indenture that the local authority would take\n\nover and maintain it.24 The question then is, in the factual\n\nmatrix before me, whether the words in the indenture, i.e.:to pass and repass with or without horses\n\n  cattle and other animals carts carriages motor cars and other vehicles of every\n\n  description along the Service Road and to enjoy the open space coloured brown in the said\n\n  plan annexed.are sufficiently wide to include the right to\n\npark vehicles. I am of the view that they are, for it is inconceivable that in the\n\ncircumstances, vehicular parking would not have been provided for. Furthermore, parking of\n\nvehicles is incidental to access by vehicles. If there were no right to park, it would\n\nmean that the defendants were only entitled to be conveyed to their units by vehicle, such\n\nas in a taxi. If they owned cars, they would have had to park them elsewhere and walk\n\nback. Although the expression\"pass and repass\"by itself would not\n\ninclude the right to park, I would hold that the words\"to enjoy the open\n\nspace\"in the context of the indenture and the circumstances of the case, cover\n\nparking of vehicles consistent with the defendants' right of way over the Land.\n\nAccordingly the defendants are entitled to the rights in declaration (iii).25 As for declaration (ii), in my view the\n\neasement granted does not cover the use by the defendants of the Land for the purpose of\n\nstoring goods or other chattel. Such use is not incidental to the right of way over the\n\nLand. Therefore the plaintiffs are entitled to declaration (ii).Lee Seiu KinJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
