        "THE PLAINTIFFS’ CASE": "12 Mr Alain Gallochat, a European Patent Attorney and Trademark\n\nAttorney, has been the General Counsel of the First Plaintiff since 1987. The First\n\nPlaintiff and the Second Plaintiff entered into a Collaboration Agreement on 26 March 1981\n\nwhich was subsequently renewed on 11 July 1990 pursuant to which the Second Plaintiff\n\nbecame the exclusive licensee of the Patent and of foreign filings for a number of\n\ncountries including Singapore.13 He explained that the European Patent in question covered a pioneer\n\ninvention made by Professor L Montagnier and his co-workers at the First Plaintiff\n\nrelating to the HIV-2 virus. The application for the Patent was filed with the European\n\nPatent Office (\"EPO\") on 22 January 1987 and was granted on 2 November 1989\n\nafter substantive examination at the EPO. One of the countries designated in the EPO\n\nfiling was the United Kingdom. The substantive examination was aimed at verifying\n\nconformity of the claimed invention with the main European patentability requirements of\n\nnovelty, inventive step, industrial application and sufficiency of disclosure. Many prior\n\nart references were considered in the process.14 Opposition to the Patent was lodged by Abbott Laboratories sometime\n\nin August 1990 but that was subsequently withdrawn in September 1991. When Abbott\n\nLaboratories lodged the opposition, it had already obtained a sub-licence of the rights to\n\nthe Patent. The fact of withdrawal could be construed as a clear recognition of the\n\nPatent’s validity. Further, the Opposition Division of the EPO could have examined\n\nthe case of its own motion under Article 114(1) of the European Patent Convention but did\n\nnot exercise such right and the Patent was maintained unamended.15 The Patent was registered under the Registration of United Kingdom\n\nPatents Act in Singapore on the basis of the United Kingdom part of the European Patent.\n\nThe Patent was in force at all material times under the Patents Act and the First\n\nPlaintiff was therefore entitled to all privileges and rights in the Patent in Singapore\n\nsubject to the conditions provided in the Act.16 Insofar as the subject matter of the Patent was concerned, the\n\nPlaintiffs summarized the claims of the Patent as covering the following:(1) Claims 1 to 9 - the HIV-2 virus and variants thereof;(2) Claims 10 to 19 - the antigens of HIV-2;(3) Claims 20 to 32 - the compositions for in vitro detection of HIV-2\n\n  antibodies;(4) Claims 33 to 37 - the processes for the in vitro detection of,\n\n  inter alia, HIV-2 antibodies;(5) Claims 38 to 40 - diagnostic kits for the in vitro detection of,\n\n  inter alia, HIV-2 antibodies.17 Mr Gallochat explained that the Patent was the first to claim a\n\nnovel type of Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (HIV-2) and was therefore a pioneer invention\n\nof considerable significance. This new type HIV retrovirus was capable of causing AIDS in\n\nman. Previously, the only known virus that was pathogenic to man was the HIV-1 virus.18 The Patent also claimed all further aspects of patentable nature\n\nconnected with, and/or derived from, the HIV-2 retrovirus, in particular, specific HIV-2\n\nviruses deposited with depository institutions in France and in the United Kingdom and\n\nvariants thereof, antigens of such viruses, assay methods and kits based on such antigens\n\nfor the in vitro detection of HIV-2 antibodies, i.e. for the diagnosis of HIV infection.\n\nThe Patent also claimed nucleic acid sequences of the HIV-2 genome and recombinant vectors\n\ncomprising of the said sequence.19 Mr Gallochat then proceeded to explain the various technical terms\n\nused. A retrovirus is a polyprotein made up of a long sequence or chain of building blocks\n\ncalled amino acids. 21 different amino acids (each designated individually by a letter in\n\nthe alphabet, e.g. A, F, R) are known to exist and make up proteins. Some proteins have\n\nsome sugar content and these are called glycoproteins.20 A lysate is a disordered mixture of proteins produced when a virus\n\nis split under strong denaturing conditions such as heating.21 Certain short portions or lengths of amino acid units distributed\n\nall along the whole sequence of a viral polyprotein show immunological functionality in\n\nthat they are recognized specifically by antibodies formed and released in the blood of a\n\nperson infected by the virus. In this manner, infected human blood sera contain antibodies\n\nagainst the infecting virus and these antibodies recognize the said short portions or\n\nlengths of amino acid units in the same way as a sophisticated key recognizes and fits its\n\ncorresponding lock. Such short portions or lengths of amino acid units showing\n\nimmunological functionality are known as epitopes or antigenic determinants. When an\n\nepitope is found within a longer chain of amino acids, such a chain therefore has\n\nimmunological behaviour or reactivity and is known as an antigen.22 Antibodies are polyproteins which are formed and released in blood\n\nsera in response to the introduction of an extraneous or foreign agent into the body of a\n\nhuman or an animal. This foreign agent may be an antigen or a whole virus which contains a\n\nvariety of antigens. Such antibodies aim to neutralize the harmful effect of the antigen\n\nor virus on the body. They are therefore highly selective for the antigen which induced\n\ntheir production and specifically recognize it by binding to it or reacting with it when\n\nthe two are brought into contact. Such a reaction is termed an immunological reaction.23 The formation of such specific antigen-antibody pairs or complexes\n\nor immunological complexes or immunological conjugates has been the basis of modern\n\nimmunological methods and kits for use in diagnostics.24 One of the modern immunological methods makes use of the Western\n\nBlot or Immunoblot technic, whereby a viral lysate is submitted to an electrophoresis\n\nwhich, in turn, is a method to separate components such as proteins in a given solution by\n\nmeans of an electrical field in which single components separate from each other based on\n\ntheir net electrical charges. By this, the proteins, which were a disordered mixture in\n\nthe lysate, are separated into pure protein bands and affixed to a suitable medium such as\n\nnitrocellulose strips.25 A monoclonal antibody is a type of antibody whose specificity for\n\nits corresponding antigen is very high. It may therefore be used in recognizing and\n\ndetecting a specific part or fraction (i.e. the epitope) of its target antigen. Some\n\ndiagnostic methods, known as immuno assays, are therefore able to detect the presence of\n\nspecific antibodies in serum by using a specific bacterial or viral antigen, thus\n\ndemonstrating that the person in question is infected by the corresponding bacterium or\n\nvirus.26 As the Patent’s Claims 16 to 19 cover antigens which contain\n\nall or a part of the sequence of the antigenic proteins in Claims 10 to 15, fragments of\n\nthese proteins (peptides), which are parts of the whole sequence of the HIV-2 virus and\n\nwhich comprise at least one immunologically functional length or epitope capable of\n\nbinding to HIV-2 antibodies, are encompassed by Claims 16 to 19.27 In 1996 or thereabouts, the Plaintiffs became aware that HIV tool\n\nkits were being manufactured and sold by the First Defendants. In or about April 1998, the\n\nPlaintiffs instructed solicitors in Singapore to conduct further investigations into the\n\nsuspected infringement of the Patent. On 30 June 1998, private investigators were\n\ninstructed to conduct a trap purchase of the First Defendant’s HIV-2 Western Blot 1.2\n\nand HIV Blot 2.2 test kits. They managed to purchase the kits from the Second Defendant on\n\n17 July 1998.28 On 29 July 1998, the First Plaintiff sent the said kits to Professor\n\nJacques Henri Max Cohen, Professor of Immunology at the Centre Hospitalo –\n\nUniversitaire of Reims, for testing. Mr Gallochat also studied the instruction manuals\n\nfound in the packaging of the First Defendant’s two test kits together with Professor\n\nCohen’s findings. Both kits were subsequently found to have infringed the Patent. In\n\nparticular, the First Defendant’s HIV Blot 2.2 test kit and its use were found to\n\nhave infringed Claims 19, 20, 33, 34, 35, 38 and 39 and the HIV-2 Western-Blot 1.2 test\n\nkit and its use were found to have infringed Claims 12, 13, 20, 22, 24, 33, 34, 35, 38 and\n\n39.29 The Patent claimed priority from the French application which was\n\nregistered on 22 January 1986. Before this first priority date of the Patent, only one\n\ngroup of retroviruses was known to be infectious and pathogenic to humans, i.e. the virus\n\nknown as HIV-1. The First Plaintiff never intended the Patent to cover HIV-1 and this\n\ncould be seen from the description of the Patent which expressly acknowledged HIV-1 as\n\nprior art.30 Mr Gallochat then discussed the documents and publications cited by\n\nthe Defendants as evidence of lack of novelty in their attack on the validity of the\n\nPatent and concluded, with Professor Cohen, that they did not destroy the novelty of\n\nClaims 10 to 19 relating to antigens, Claims 20 to 23 on compositions, Claims 38 to 40 on\n\nkits containing them and Claims 33 to 37 on immuno assays.31 Further, nothing in the cited documents made Claim 33 and its\n\ndependent Claims obvious or lacking in inventive step.32 The First Plaintiff had to overcome two major difficulties in making\n\nthe invention, including Claim 33. The first was the conceptual difficulty because at the\n\ntime of the invention, it was simply inconceivable or at least not shown that another type\n\nof HIV other than HIV-1 existed. The other was the factual and practical difficulty\n\ninvolved. The inventors had access to African AIDS patients from Cape Verde Islands and\n\nGuinea Bissau who either could not be or were very weakly detected as seropositive by\n\nconventional HIV-1 antibody tests. This intriguing finding, that patients with overt AIDS\n\nsymptoms but who were not HIV-1 antibody reactive, which led to the invention was a\n\nfundamental chance event which could not be predicted at all. The inventors had to\n\nexercise their skill and expertise to surmise that it was not HIV-1 that was causing AIDS\n\nin these African patients but a different pathogen. The First Plaintiff’s work to\n\nisolate this new virus incurred much in terms of time, money and research. The importance\n\nof this discovery could be seen in the wealth of scientific research generated and the\n\ninterest of numerous firms in obtaining a licence for the Patent. The World Health\n\nOrganization has also made it compulsory to test for HIV-2 in blood screening programmes\n\nsanctioned by it.33 As a result of the Defendants’ amendment to their Particulars\n\nof Objection to include a challenge to the novelty and inventive step of Claim 19 of the\n\nPatent, Mr Gallochat was given leave to affirm a Second Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\n(\"AEIC\") after the first tranche of trial dates.34 In this second AEIC, Mr Gallochat said that the EPO had examined and\n\nallowed all the Claims of the Patent by applying the test of whether a person skilled in\n\nthe art found the Claims novel and inventive, in the same way it would have applied the\n\ntest in an attack on the validity of the Claim.35 In the EPO, a person skilled in the art would be presumed to be an\n\nordinary practitioner aware of what was common general knowledge in the art at the\n\npriority date claimed by a Patent. It would also be presumed that he had access to\n\neverything in the state of the art and had at his disposal the normal means and capacity\n\nfor routine work and experimentation.36 In particular, where biotechnology was concerned, this notional\n\nperson could be represented by a team of specialists oriented towards practicalities and\n\nthe development of the art normally expected of him did not include solving technical\n\nproblems by performing scientific research in areas as yet unexplored. In genetic\n\nengineering, the skilled person was not to be defined as a Nobel Prize laureate, even if a\n\nnumber of scientists working in this field at that time were actually awarded the Nobel\n\nPrize.37 It followed therefore that, in 1986, a skilled person in the field\n\nof AIDS research was an average technician having a good knowledge of this field and\n\ngeneral knowledge. He did not need be an opinion leader. Instead, he would follow the\n\nadvice of the known opinion leaders in the field. In 1986, AIDS was a new field which had\n\nnot been well explored.38 An invention would be considered new if it was not part of the state\n\nof the art which comprised all that was publicly available before the priority date here\n\n(22 January 1986). Novelty was to be determined by considering whether all the claimed\n\nsubject matter could be found in its entirety in the prior art document. Before something\n\ncould be said to be lacking in novelty, all the distinctive features or characteristics of\n\nthe claimed subject matter must be completely and clearly disclosed in a given prior art\n\ndocument or can be clearly, directly and unambiguously derived by the skilled person from\n\nthe said prior art document.39 An invention would be considered as involving an inventive step, if,\n\nhaving regard to the state of the art, it was not obvious to a person skilled in the art.\n\nThe inquiry was not whether the skilled person could have performed the invention but\n\nwhether he would have done so at the priority date, in the expectation of solving the\n\nunderlying technical problem. It was often possible to show after an invention had been\n\ndeveloped that a person skilled in the art could have been led to it by combining separate\n\npieces of prior art, but such considerations would have to be disregarded since they\n\nresulted from ex post facto analysis.40 The fact that other teams or persons were working contemporaneously\n\non the same project might suggest that it was obvious to try or that it was an interesting\n\narea to explore but that did not necessarily imply that there was a reasonable expectation\n\nof success, which was not the same as hoping to succeed. A reasonable expectation of\n\nsuccess implied the ability of the skilled person to predict rationally, on the basis of\n\nthe knowledge existing before a research project was started, the successful conclusion of\n\nthe project within acceptable time limits.41 The law applied by the EPO, as stated above, was the same or\n\nsubstantially the same as that of the United Kingdom.42 Applying Professor Cohen’s conclusions in his second AEIC on\n\nthe cited prior art documents and the abovestated principles, nothing in those documents\n\ncould be construed as adversely affecting the novelty of Claim 19. Similarly, applying\n\nProfessor Cohen’s conclusion on \"inventive step\" and the relevant\n\nprinciples, nothing in those documents made Claim 19 obvious either.43 In cross-examination, Mr Gallochat explained that a European Patent\n\ncould be revoked only at the EPO in an opposition proceeding. However, a Patent could be\n\ndeclared invalid by a national Court. National Courts have also differed from decisions of\n\nthe EPO.44 In the Abbott Laboratories’ opposition to the Patent, the case\n\nwent no further than the notice of opposition and the reply by the proprietor of the\n\nPatent. There was no oral hearing and no opinion given by the EPO on the merits. However,\n\nin Mr Gallochat’s view, the EPO’s decision not to proceed, although it had the\n\npower to, after Abbott Laboratories’ withdrawal of its opposition showed that the EPO\n\nwas convinced by the First Plaintiff’s reply.45 Mr Gallochat declined to answer questions relating to science as he\n\nwas skilled in the art of Patent, not in science. The scientific statements contained in\n\nhis AEIC were there because of what the scientific experts had told him.46 Claim 19 was a product claim. It contained two parts – the\n\nstructural (amino acid sequence) and the functional claims. For infringement of the claim\n\nto take place, both parts must have been infringed. Infringement would take place if the\n\nsequence or part of the sequence was reproduced, so long as it raised the immunological\n\nreaction. One could not escape infringement just by adding or subtracting some part. In\n\ncontrast, Claim 33 was a process claim. If Claim 19 was infringed, Claim 33 would also be\n\ninfringed. However, Claim 33 could be infringed without infringing Claim 19.47 Professor Jacques Henri Max Cohen has been Professor of Immunology\n\nat the Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire of Reims since 1993. He was conferred the degrees of\n\nDoctor of Medicine in 1983 and of Doctor of Philosophy in Human Biology in 1989. He has\n\nbeen involved in the study of immunology for the last two decades.48 His relationship with the Plaintiffs was a purely scientific one due\n\nto the fact that the First Plaintiff was one of the major scientific research foundations\n\nin France. He was engaged on an independent basis. On 29 July 1998, the Plaintiffs asked\n\nhim to perform studies with the First Defendant’s said two diagnostic kits.49 Professor Cohen explained that the Patent in issue covered a major\n\ninvention by Professor L. Montagnier and his team relating to the HIV-2 virus isolation\n\nand ensuing applications such as the diagnosis of HIV infection or the screening of blood\n\ndonations. The invention was of great significance as it related to AIDS and provided\n\nscreening means where none existed before.50 The Patent made available to a person skilled in the art all the\n\ninformation needed for using this virus or a fragment thereof (such as a peptide or\n\nprotein) for in vitro diagnosis of HIV-2 infections. It enabled a person to use any strain\n\nof the virus or a desired fragment to design, inter alia, antigens reacting specifically\n\nwith the antibodies contained in the sera of patients infected with this new AIDS\n\npathogen. In particular, the Patent had information on the virus and the variants thereof,\n\nthe well characterized genome organization and viral antigenic proteins, peptide and\n\nnucleic sequences (for those who wished to work on peptides of any sizes or on nucleic\n\nacids) and reference procedures which a person skilled in the art would know how to apply\n\nor modify easily.51 The Patent also provided the full amino acid sequence of the antigen\n\ncontained in the viral envelope of HIV-2 and taught that compositions containing\n\nglycoprotein gp 36 could be used in HIV-2 infection diagnosis.52 The aim of Professor Cohen’s study was to evaluate whether the\n\nFirst Defendant’s kits used the invention covered by the Patent. On 12 and 13 August\n\n1998, experiments were performed by a technician under Professor Cohen’s direct\n\nsupervision. HIV-infected blood was brought into contact with the nitrocellulose test\n\nstrips provided in both kits.53 HIV-1 and HIV-2 have three basic levels of proteins – gag\n\n(core), pol (polymerase) and env (envelope). Both viruses share some similarities at the\n\nlevel of their gag and pol proteins and less at the env protein level. The first two\n\nlevels of proteins would therefore display a higher degree of cross-reactivity than at the\n\nenv level.54 The experiments, detailed in Professor Cohen’s first AEIC,\n\nshowed that both kits were able to specifically detect HIV-2 antibodies in serum samples.\n\nThe 2.2 kit was, in addition, able to differentiate HIV-2 antibody positive samples from\n\nHIV-1 antibody positive samples.55 A second series of experiments was conducted to identify the\n\nparticular HIV-2 env peptide used in the 2.2 test kit. The analysis of the antigens on the\n\nstrips tested with a monoclonal antibody proved that the HIV-2 env synthetic peptide used\n\nin the 2.2 kit contained an amino acid sequence or a part thereof which raised a specific\n\nimmunological reaction with HIV-2 antibodies and which was covered by Claim 19 of the\n\nPatent. In making a suitable synthetic peptide for specifically detecting HIV-2\n\nantibodies, a manufacturer would invariably incorporate at least one reactive epitope.\n\nOther amino acids on the peptide would not be involved in the immunological reaction but\n\nwere added for other reasons, such as to stabilize the entire peptide or to facilitate\n\ntheir binding to the nitrocellulose strips.56 The results of the experiments confirmed that both kits and the use\n\nof the assay procedure were within the claims of the Patent.57 Professor Cohen went on to explain the differences among HIV-1,\n\nHIV-2 and SIV. Retroviruses like these could infect a variety of mammals such as man,\n\nmonkeys and cats. The retrovirus that opened the way to multiple infections which could\n\neventually kill the host (AIDS) was called the Immune Deficiency virus, the one which\n\nattacked and infected man being termed Human Immune Deficiency virus or HIV. The two major\n\ntypes identified were HIV-1 and HIV-2 but as retroviruses mutated frequently, many\n\nvariants or isolates of these two types were known. HIV-1 was more pathogenic to man than\n\nHIV-2 although both could cause AIDS in man. HIV-1 had long spread worldwide whereas HIV-2\n\nwas found more frequently in West Africa and secondarily in Europe.58 The Immune Deficiency Viruses that infected monkeys were termed\n\nSimian Immune Deficiency Viruses or SIV. A variety of such SIV have been named according\n\nto the host animal which would appear as an abbreviated subscript. For instance, SIVMACwould refer to SIV in the macaque monkey and SIVAGMwould be the SIV in the\n\nAfrican Green Monkey and that in the Chimpanzee would be termed SIVCPZ.59 A family tree or phylogenic tree could be drawn to show the\n\nrelationship of some of the most well-known HIV and SIV viruses, which probably derived\n\nfrom a yet unidentified common ancestor. Such a tree was based on the compared sequences\n\nof the constitutive RNA (ribonucleic acid) of the various Immune Deficiency Viruses. The\n\ncloser any two viruses appeared in the phylogenic tree, the greater would be the identity\n\nshared by their respective RNA sequences.60 One peptide sequence in the envelope transmembrane protein is very\n\nimportant diagnostically because it is highly immunogenic (i.e. it induces the host’s\n\nproduction of a lot of antibodies against it and raises a specific immunological reaction\n\nwith antibodies so produced) and because it is rather well-conserved among the different\n\nHIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV viruses and isolates. This highly immunogenic peptide sequence is\n\nalso known as the immunodominant region.61 When comparing the immunodominant region in HIV-1, HIV-2 and SIV,\n\nall SIVs had at least the LNA sequence whereas HIV-2ROD(the HIV-2 prototype of\n\nthe Patent) had the LNS sequence. The 2.2 test kit clearly made use of a peptide located\n\nin the immunodominant region with the LNS sequence. That was exactly that of the patented\n\nHIV-2RODvirus included in the sequence of Claim 19 and not a sequence\n\nextracted from a SIV published in January 1990.62 Professor Cohen then went on to address the issue of lack of\n\nnovelty. Before the priority date of 22 January 1986, only HIV-1 was known to be\n\npathogenic to humans. At that date, a retrovirus discovered in a diseased macaque monkey\n\nwas identified and called SIV/STLV-III interchangeably. Having studied the five prior\n\npublications cited by the Defendants in their Particulars of Objection, Professor Cohen\n\nconcluded that the publications contained a few characteristics of SIV but did not reveal\n\nthe existence or characteristics of HIV-2. It was clear that HIV-2 was neither known nor\n\navailable to the public before the earliest priority date of the Patent. Consequently, its\n\nantigens could not have been identified.63 On the issue of lack of inventive step as far as Claim 33 and its\n\ndependent claims were concerned, Professor Cohen relied on his earlier discussion on the\n\nprior art publications. He reiterated that the virus whose existence had been envisaged by\n\nBarin was one not pathogenic to humans. Furthermore, it was then found that this HTLV-IV\n\nretrovirus was in fact a SIVMACretrovirus which contaminated a cell culture.\n\nEven if one disregarded this error, mere knowledge of a HIV virus would not have made it\n\npossible on 22 January 1986 to surmise the existence of a pathogenic HIV virus different\n\nfrom HIV-1. Consequently, the question of producing such a virus never arose. Barin in\n\nfact referred to a hypothetical virus which was not pathogenic to man. His article\n\ncontained nothing whatsoever which could have led the man skilled in the art to predict\n\nthe existence of retrovirus groups other than HIV-1.64 It was therefore clear that prior to the claimed invention, the only\n\nknown agent responsible for AIDS in humans was HTLV-III or HIV-1 as it is now called. The\n\nprior art articles cited by the Defendants did not suggest the existence of a problem at\n\nthe root of the invention – i.e. that the inventors had observed that serological\n\nstudies carried out with HTLV-III lysate led to the observation that some patients, who\n\nhad clinical and immunological signs of AIDS, nevertheless showed seronegative or very\n\nfaintly positive reactions. The solution to this problem (i.e. the identification and the\n\nproduction of the HIV-2) was not disclosed. This showed that Claims 1 to 9 of the Patent\n\nprovided evidence of inventive step. Since the other claims of the Patent were directly or\n\nindirectly related to Claims 1 to 9, this was sufficient proof of the inventive step of\n\nthe subsequent claims.65 On sufficiency of disclosure, Professor Cohen stated that the Patent\n\ndid enable a person skilled in the art to select a suitably reactive fragment/epitope as\n\nit taught everything the skilled person needed in order to prepare and identify a sequence\n\nfragment able to raise a specific immunological reaction with the antibodies against a\n\nHIV-2 retrovirus as claimed in Claim 19. The Patent did not need to teach things which\n\nwere part of the common general knowledge. The Patent also taught that the HIV-2 envelope\n\nantigens were little or not recognized by HIV-1 antibodies.66 Further, the Patent suggested clearly that the envelope was the best\n\ntarget antigen in terms of detection efficiency and taught that the envelope glycoprotein\n\nwas the protein antigen of choice in which epitopes were to be looked for and identified.67 The Patent’s teachings taken together with common general\n\nknowledge allowed the man of ordinary skill in the art to obtain peptides or epitopes\n\nwhich would specifically react with antibodies against the HIV-2 retrovirus as claimed in\n\nClaim 19.68 As for the Defendants’ averment that the Patent purported to\n\nclaim all processes for in vitro detection of HIV-2 antibodies but in fact did not teach a\n\nskilled person how to identify every single immuno-reactive epitope, Professor Cohen\n\nexplained that a single process for in vitro diagnosis of HIV-2 required only one\n\nimmuno-reactive epitope. The skilled person did not need to incorporate every single\n\nimmuno-reactive epitope into his diagnosis process/kit. Nevertheless, if such a person\n\nneeded to find further immuno-reactive epitopes, he could use well-known methods such as\n\nPepscan to do so.69 In response to the First Defendant’s averment that its\n\nsynthetic peptide was first synthesized on 14 January 1990 and that its LNS sequence was\n\nfound in many strains of SIV, Professor Cohen said that at that time, taking into account\n\nthe then SIV sequences, only the HIV-2 envelope sequence had the exact sequence of the\n\nFirst Defendant’s synthetic peptide. That peptide was and still is a HIV-2 peptide\n\ncovered by Claim 19. Few SIV sequences were published in January 1990 and they all at\n\nleast had the LNA sequence whereas HIV-2RODhad the LNS sequence. One could not\n\nlook at sequences of SIVs now known when the selection of the peptide was said to have\n\nbeen made in January 1990. The choice available in January 1990 was not the same as that\n\ntoday.70 In his second AEIC which was affirmed to address the challenge to\n\nClaim 19, Professor Cohen discussed the seven prior art documents cited by the First\n\nDefendant, out of which only four were relied on by the First Defendant in evidence\n\n(Daniel, Kanki-1, Kanki-2 and Barin). The other two were published in 1987 which was\n\nobviously after the priority date. The remaining one (Essex), published in November 1985,\n\nwas not cited in evidence by the First Defendant. In any event, it stated about the same\n\nthings as Kanki-2 did and his comments on Kanki-2 would apply thereto.71 Professor Cohen stated:\"Prior artDaniel8. The article Daniel et al., Science 228:1201, 1985\n\n  (\"Daniel\") disclosed the isolation of a simian retrovirus – now named SIVMAC– identified in macaques. This article only dealt with the isolation, cultivation,\n\n  morphological properties of the virus. Nothing was said regarding its antigenic\n\n  properties. Clearly, Daniel did not anticipate the HIV-2 envelope antigen claimed in claim\n\n  19 of the Patent.Kanki-19. The article Kanki et al., Science 228:1199, 1985 (Kanki 1)\n\n  disclosed the serological properties of the simian retrovirus, SIVMACreferred\n\n  to in Daniel. Kanki 1 disclosed the entire envelope proteins of SIVMACdesignated\n\n  GP160 and GP120 but not the fragments. The sequence of these proteins was not disclosed.\n\n  In fact, nothing in Kanki 1 indicated that either of these proteins had the sequence of\n\n  claim 19.10. As agreed by Professor Letvin when he gave evidence in Court,\n\n  nothing in Kanki 1 stated that SIVMACcould infect man. Consequently, there was\n\n  no statement that SIVMACGP160 and GP120 was used or could be used as antigen\n\n  to detect in humans infection by a human immunodeficiency virus – i.e. a virus\n\n  capable of causing AIDS in man.11. In addition, to the best of my knowledge, at the priority date, the\n\n  SIVMACvirus was not deposited, in an official cell collection such as, for\n\n  example ATCC (American Type Culture Collection). Therefore there was no way for the\n\n  skilled person before the priority date, firstly, to determine the sequence of SIVMAC’s\n\n  GP160 and GP120, and, secondly, to establish clearly whether the SIVMAC’s\n\n  GP160 and GP120 proteins could raise a specific immunological reaction with antibodies\n\n  directed against a human immunodeficiency virus other than HIV-1.Kanki 212. The article Kanki et al., Science 230:951, 1985 (\"Kanki\n\n  2\") disclosed the isolation of a simian retrovirus identified in African green\n\n  monkeys, named STLV-IIIAGM/SIVAGM. I agree with Professor\n\n  Letvin’s position, when he gave evidence in Court that nothing in Kanki 2 stated that\n\n  SIVAGMcould infect man and that the only \"closely related viruses\"\n\n  considered in the article only referred to immunodeficiency viruses then known, namely\n\n  HIV-1/HTLV III, SIVMACand SIVAGMand not to any other\n\n  immunodeficiency virus.13. As a matter of fact, when Kanki 2 indicated in page 953, right hand\n\n  column, lines 1 – 5:\"As is the case of HTLV III-infected people, the gp160/120 appear\n\n    to be the best serologic markers for infection by these closely related viruses.\"there was no statement that SIVAGM’s GP160 and GP120\n\n  was used or could be used to detect in humans infection by a human immunodeficiency virus\n\n  other than the only then known, HIV-1/HTLV III.14. Kanki 2 disclosed the entire envelope proteins of SIVAGM– (which was later known to be a culture contamination of SIVMAC) –\n\n  designated GP160 and GP120 as only assessed by Western Blot immunoanalysis using\n\n  polyclonal sera from infected subjects without any indication of sequence, immunodominant\n\n  fragments or epitope mapping. The sequence of these proteins was not disclosed either and\n\n  therefore the antigen of claim 19 having the \"envrn\" sequence was not\n\n  anticipated.15. It must be noted that after the priority date of the Patent it was\n\n  shown by Franchini et al (see page. 911 of the Agreed Bundle Volume III) in 1987, that the\n\n  genomic structure of STLV-IIIAGMdiffers from those of HIV-2. Franchini\n\n  demonstrates that \"STLV-IIIAGMand HIV-2RODare (more)\n\n  closely related to each other\" but not identical. This is an additional clear\n\n  evidence that the antigen of claim 19 was new in view of what was revealed in Kanki 2.Barin16. Barin disclosed, 4 years after the first identification of AIDS\n\n  (June 1981), serological studies made in Senegal, West Africa, a region where AIDS or\n\n  AIDS-related diseases had not yet been observed. HTLV III and STLV-IIIAGM/SIVAGMWestern Blot tests were performed on a variety of healthy subjects in Senegal. The SIVAGMGP160 and GP120 proteins were shown to react with serum from healthy human subjects. The\n\n  results suggest that some Senegalese people, while being healthy, i.e. with no symptoms of\n\n  AIDS or AIDS-related diseases, had been exposed to a virus-designated \"STLV-IIIAGM– like virus\" – that was more closely related to STLV-III than to\n\n  HTLV-III/HIV-1.17. As agreed by Professor Letvin when he was giving evidence in Court,\n\n  in this article, unlike the other three (3) articles, no virus had been isolated,\n\n  purified, let alone deposited and therefore no \"STLV-IIIAGM– like\n\n  virus\" had been made available to the public. In 1985, no skilled person was able to\n\n  clone and sequence a virus or isolate its envelope protein without first having the virus\n\n  at hand, or at least its nucleic acid in the form of an homogenous strain or cloned\n\n  nucleic acids. The difficulty was in the obtaining the virus. Consequently, no GP160 and\n\n  GP120 proteins from this so-called \"STLV-IIIAGM– like virus\"\n\n  had been directly disclosed, isolated or purified and no fragments thereof or the sequence\n\n  of these proteins either disclosed.18. Additionally nothing in Barin stated that the putative\n\n  \"STLV-IIIAGM– like virus\" GP160 and GP120 proteins were used or\n\n  could be used to detect in humans infection by a human immunodeficiency virus, capable of\n\n  causing AIDS in man, other than the only one then known, HIV1/HTLV III. Clearly, the SIVAGM-like\n\n  GP160 and GP120 proteins were not disclosed in Barin at the epitope or sequence level and\n\n  did not anticipate the antigen of claim 19 in the Patent.\"72 Professor Cohen concluded that as none of the prior art documents\n\nanticipated the HIV-2 antigen of Claim 19, the latter must be considered novel.73 On the question of inventive step of Claim 19, Professor Cohen\n\nstated that it was not obvious to arrive at the HIV-2 antigen when looking at the prior\n\nart documents mentioned above. Prior to 22 January 1986, the only known virus capable of\n\ncausing AIDS in humans was HIV-1.74 Of utmost importance was the fact that none of the prior art\n\ndocuments had identified, or had been faced with, the intriguing and challenging situation\n\nthe inventors were facing – the fact that some samples from Western African patients\n\nhaving clear AIDS symptoms gave seronegative or very weakly positive reactions with\n\nconventional HIV-1 based reagents. The problem of the possible existence of other human\n\npathogenic viruses had never been raised before the priority date.75 Barin, the closest prior art, in fact taught away from the patented\n\nHIV-2 invention by stating that HIV-1 caused AIDS in man and that human beings also\n\nharboured a virus close to STLV-III, so called STLV-IIIAGMor SIVMAC,\n\nthat did not cause any pathology. On the teachings of Barin, a skilled person could not\n\npredict rationally nor come to the conclusion that another virus existed which caused AIDS\n\nin man and that an antigen having the ENVRN sequence existed enabling detection of\n\ninfection of the said virus in the samples from the West African patients.76 The prior art documents, taken alone or in combination, did not\n\nsuggest the antigen covered by Claim 19, which could not therefore be said to be obvious.\n\nAccordingly, Claim 19 involved an inventive step.77 The First Defendant’s expert witness, Professor Norman Letvin,\n\nhad given evidence that it was obvious that HIV-2 could cause AIDS in man because SIVMAC= SIVSM= HIV-2 and SIVMACcaused AIDS in macaques. In response,\n\nProfessor Cohen pointed out that there were papers published shortly after the priority\n\ndate which showed that both SIVSMand the Essex team’s so-called HTLV-IV\n\nwere considered to be harmless to sootey mangabeys and to man respectively.78 Applying the principles that an invention must be new, must involve\n\nan inventive step and must be disclosed in a manner sufficiently clear and complete for it\n\nto be carried out by a person skilled in the art, Professor Cohen opined that Claim 19 met\n\nthose requirements and was therefore valid.79 Professor Cohen elaborated in oral testimony on the HIV-2’s 18\n\nmer sequence. This sequence was now known to be present in many isolates of SIV but,\n\nsurprisingly, not in the closest sub-type, SIVMAC. SIVMACwas the\n\nclosest to HIV-2 but there was at present no SIVMACsequence matching the 18\n\nmer exactly. As at 22 January 1986, no SIV sequence had been published. The First\n\nDefendant’s nitrocellulose strip had a 23 mer sequence but the antigenic part was the\n\n18 mer sequence of the Patent. The extra five amino acids were merely to allow the antigen\n\nto be correctly attached to the strip.80 In cross-examination, Professor Cohen agreed that the American term\n\nHTLV-III was now known as HIV-1 and that the official nomendature for STLV-III was now\n\nSIV. Before the priority date, it had been suggested but never demonstrated that other\n\nHIVs existed. Professor Cohen disagreed with the First Defendant’s case that it was\n\nalready known before the priority date that this other HIV was more closely related to SIV\n\nthan to HIV-1. He asserted that this virus was not known as Barin did not succeed in\n\ngetting a stable strain. Serological data suggested however that the place of this virus\n\namong the HIV family might be close to that of a SIV. Data to suggest that a retrovirus\n\nfrom the HIV family could have been transmitted from monkeys to man in evolution also\n\nexisted but there was no definitive evidence.81 Professor Cohen also disagreed that HIV and AIDS researchers at the\n\npriority date were alerted to the possibility that SIV could cause AIDS in humans. He\n\nmaintained that it was nothing more than a hypthothesis. There was nothing in the\n\npublications that would have alerted the researchers in this manner.82 Asked whether Barin’s article having been published in December\n\n1985 and the Patent having been filed on 22 January 1986 indicated that Barin or other\n\nteams were about to reach their destination by December 1985, Professor Cohen explained\n\nthat by 19 December 1985, the First Plaintiff’s virus had been registered with the\n\ndepository to obtain the priority and the rights. At the end of the day, the First\n\nPlaintiff got to the finishing line ahead of the others. Professor Cohen disagreed that\n\nthe invention was obvious at the priority date following the teachings of the four cited\n\nprior art documents, in particular Barin, because Barin was stating the opposite\n\nhypothesis that a non-pathogenic virus closely related to SIV could be present for a long\n\ntime in humans. Barin was interested in finding such a virus to obtain an attenuated\n\nstrain that might have been useful in vaccination to prevent HIV infection.83 Professor Cohen agreed that the data from Genbank showed that 69 of\n\n109 HIV-2 sequences contained the identical 18 mer sequence and that 40 did not but were\n\nconsidered HIV-2 nonetheless. The 40 were however recorded after the priority date. The 18\n\nmer sequence in HIV-2 could be found in some SIVs but that was not known at the priority\n\ndate. At the priority date, the only SIV known was SIVMACand no SIV sequence\n\nwas known. The 18 mer used by the First Defendant was not prior art because it was first\n\ndescribed by the Patent. The first time that the HIV-2 sequence was published was in\n\nGuyader’s article of 16 April 1987.84 The use of molecular weight to distinguish viruses was now obsolete.\n\nSequences were now used.85 The virus used in the four prior art documents was actually SIVMAC.\n\nIn Kanki-2 and Barin, it was referred to as STLVagmbut that was subsequently\n\ndiscovered to be a contamination which started in Kanki-2 and went on to Barin.86 Commenting on the First Defendant’s expert’s testimony\n\nthat while the articles did not say that SIVMACcould infect man, he and his\n\ncolleagues’ understanding was that it could cause AIDS, Professor Cohen said they\n\nmight have taken major precautions but likened the precautionary measures to putting\n\nastronauts who returned from the moon in quarantine although there was no evidence that\n\nthere was something on the moon that could affect man. It was the position taken by the\n\nHarvard Medical School Safety Committee and history had indeed shown that SIVMACcould infect man but that was long after the priority date. Professor Cohen tried to find\n\nSIVMACdeposits in the depositories before the priority date but did not manage\n\nto find any.87 The third witness for the Plaintiffs was Mr Christian Policard,\n\nChairman and CEO of the Second Plaintiff. He gave evidence on behalf of both Plaintiffs.\n\nHe testified that the Second Plaintiff was appointed exclusive licensee to the Patent in\n\nthe field of in vitro diagnostics pursuant to a collaboration agreement dated 26 March\n\n1981 and renewed on 11 July 1990. The Second Plaintiff’s exclusive rights included\n\nthe right to grant sub-licences to the Patent in all countries of the world except the\n\nUSA, Canada, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and India. A third company, Genetics Systems\n\nCorporation, now affiliated to the Second Plaintiff and incorporated in the USA, had the\n\nexclusive rights to grant sub-licences in these six countries.88 Genetics Systems Corporation’s work was to find partners in the\n\nfield of viral blood disease diagnosis, especially for blood bank markets. The company\n\ntherefore had contacts with Genelabs Diagnostics Inc. (\"GDI\") and Genelabs\n\nTechnologies Inc. (\"GTI\") in the USA. Sometime in 1992, Genetics Systems\n\nCorporation (\"GSC\") held discussions with GDI and/or GTI over the possibility of\n\nsub-licensing of the Patent in its territories. The First Defendant was wholly owned by a\n\nSingapore company known as Genelabs Asia Pte Ltd which, in turn, was wholly owned by GTI.89 In 1993, Mr Christian Mignon, then executive vice president of the\n\nSecond Plaintiff, reported to Mr Policard that some representatives of Genelabs\n\nDiagnostics SA of Switzerland (\"GDSA\"), another of the First Defendant’s\n\nrelated companies, had approached him to seek, among other things, a sub-licence of the\n\nPatent. Negotiations ensued between the Second Plaintiff and GTI and/or GDI (whose names\n\nwere used interchangeably) until December 1993 when the Second Plaintiff decided it was\n\nnot in its interest to accede to the request of GTI/GDI/GDSA. Accordingly, Mr Policard\n\ninstructed Mr Mignon to convey to GTI the Second Plaintiff’s decision to end\n\nnegotiations.90 The letter dated 23 December 1993 from the Second Plaintiff to GTI\n\nwas in the following terms:\"Re: HIV 2 license agreement.Dear Sir,Referring to our various conversation concerning an HIV 2 licence\n\n  agreement, we notify you our decision to put an end to our negotiations regarding PSD\n\n  territory HIV 2 rights for Genelabs or its affiliate Diagnostics Biotechnology.As a result, we would like to draw your attention to the fact that if\n\n  your Company continues, directly or indirectly through the medium of any affiliate, to\n\n  manufacture and/or sell products which could infringe our rights, it does so at its own\n\n  risk, as we are committed to take whatever legal action is necessary to protect and\n\n  enforce our valuable rights.Mr Bieker, as President of Genetics Systems will communicate separately\n\n  very soon with you concerning its exclusive HIV-2 licensing territory.\"91 Further correspondence followed in which GTI asked both the Second\n\nPlaintiff and GSC for the opportunity to discuss the matter further. The Second Plaintiff\n\nreiterated its stand that it was not possible to discuss any further the question of a\n\nsub-licence to GTI or its affiliates. On 25 February 1994, GSC wrote to GTI’s Mark\n\nVan Asten to emphasize that GSC had no desire or ability to sub-license to GTI in the\n\nabovesaid six countries and warned that \"any activities of your company that infringe\n\nupon Genetic System’s rights related to HIV-2 should cease immediately\".92 It was clear from the above that it was the First Defendant’s\n\nrelated companies, GDI/GTI/GDSA, that were trying to obtain the sub-licence from the\n\nSecond Plaintiff and such request for a sub-licence showed knowledge of the Patent and\n\nrecognition of the need for a licence. Since licence fees could be substantial, it would\n\nbe normal to expect any party requesting a licence to have investigated the validity of\n\nthe Patent.93 The Plaintiffs did not have any evidence of the commercialization of\n\nthe First Defendant’s infringing products until sometime in 1996 and were not aware\n\nof the publications relied upon in the Defence to infer knowledge on the part of the\n\nPlaintiffs. At any rate, the said publications did not disclose information on the\n\nprocesses and compositions of the assays or on the commercial availability of the items.\n\nEven if the Plaintiffs’ representatives had attended the conferences mentioned by the\n\nFirst Defendant, they would have been marketing personnel and not patent or scientific\n\nexperts and they would not have the requisite knowledge to scrutinize products exhibited\n\nat the conferences for evidence of infringement.94 It was in 1996 that the Plaintiffs received information that a\n\ncertain party in Singapore was manufacturing and commercializing infringing products\n\nwithout a sub-licence. Shortly thereafter, the Plaintiffs obtained photocopies of the\n\npackage inserts of infringing products being marketed in Europe and discovered that the\n\nmanufacturer thereof was the First Defendant.95 In May 1997, the Plaintiffs were informed by their subsidiary in\n\nTaiwan that Genelabs had filed an application to have its HIV Blot 2.2 kit registered at\n\nthe Department of Health in Taiwan. The First Plaintiff then sent Genelabs Taipei Liaison\n\nOffice a warning letter on 30 June 1997 and informed the Taiwan Department of Health about\n\nthe infringing kits.96 On 28 July 1997, Genelabs Biotechnology Co Ltd of Taiwan replied to\n\nsay that they did not believe that their \"activities in Taiwan with HIV Blot 2.2 test\n\nkits fall within the scope of this Taiwan patent\".97 The Plaintiffs did not commence legal proceedings against the First\n\nDefendant immediately for three reasons:(1) The Plaintiffs were very far from Singapore and did not have enough\n\n  information to reach a reasoned decision whether to sue;(2) The Plaintiffs did not have any operations or a representative\n\n  office here making it difficult to make inquiries here and were therefore relying on their\n\n  sub-licensees for information;(3) The Plaintiffs’ attention at that time was focused on other\n\n  infringement cases in important markets in other parts of the world, such as Europe.By the first half of 1998, the Plaintiffs decided to take steps to put\n\nan end to the First Defendant’s infringing activities and therefore appointed\n\nsolicitors and private investigators for this purpose.98 Mr Policard underlined the importance of the Patent to both\n\nPlaintiffs by stating that 90% of the HIV diagnostic kits sold in the world were sold\n\nunder licence from the Plaintiffs. The huge revenues generated were shared by the\n\nPlaintiffs equally to fund the research work of the First Plaintiff.99 Mr Tan See Wei was one of the private investigators instructed by\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ solicitors. His evidence was accepted without cross-examination. In\n\nJune 1998, the firm, Commercial Investigations, was instructed to conduct a trap-purchase\n\nof the HIV test kits in question and to establish where they were manufactured. Having\n\nbeen told that only specialized laboratories in Singapore carrying out HIV tests would\n\npurchase such kits, Mr Tan decided that the best way to go about his work was to try and\n\nbuy from the First Defendant or its distributor on the pretext that the kits were meant\n\nfor overseas customers.100 On 3 July 1998, he sent a request from a trading front used by\n\nCommercial Investigations called Walter & Mark Trading to the First Defendant to\n\npurchase one set each of the 2.2 and 1.2 kits purportedly on behalf of an Indonesian\n\ncustomer. He was informed by the First Defendant that enquiries concerning supply of these\n\nkits in Indonesia had to be directed to its exclusive distributor in Indonesia.101 On 9 July 1998, Mr Tan contacted the First Defendant again via the\n\nsaid trading front on the pretext that he wanted to buy the kits for customers in\n\nMalaysia. On the same day, the First Defendant’s Regional Sales Executive provided\n\nthe name of the Malaysian distributor, Nagase (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd, and gave its address in\n\nKuala Lumpur and the contact person and telephone numbers.102 Mr Tan then contacted the Malaysian company for quotations on the\n\ntwo kits, informing the company that the trading front was a Singapore business purchasing\n\nfor customers in Malaysia. The trading front then received a fax dated 11 July 1998 from\n\nthe Second Defendant whose letterhead showed the Second Defendant’s name with the\n\nKuala Lumpur address of Nagase (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd. At the bottom of the fax, however, the\n\nwords \"Singapore Office: …\" followed by a Singapore business address and\n\ntelephone number were printed. The fax was said to be from one Kon E’ Wa but was\n\nsigned by one Peter Lim, Medical and Healthcare Manager. It gave the unit price of the\n\nkits in Malaysian Ringgit and stated the following:\"Price : Nett Delivered, Malaysia.Delivery : 17/07/98 (Friday). Own collection.Terms : COD.Validity : 31stOctober 1998.Remarks : HIV Blot 2.2 and HIV-2 Blot 1.2 from Nagase (Malaysia) Sdn\n\n  Bhd to be supplied within Malaysia only.\"103 A confirmation order was sent by the private investigator to Ms Kon\n\nE’ Wa of the Second Defendant and copied to the said Peter Lim.104 On 17 July 1998, Mr Tan proceeded to the address of Nagase\n\n(Malaysia) Sdn Bhd and collected the two kits. A \"Performa Invoice\" from Nagase\n\n(Malaysia) and a Delivery Note from the Second Defendant, both dated 17 July 1998, were\n\nhanded over at the same time. Ms Kon E’ Wa, the representative of Nagase (Malaysia),\n\ninformed Mr Tan that the original invoice from the Second Defendant would be sent to him\n\nby post. The kits were then delivered by him to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors in\n\nSingapore.105 On 11 September 1998, Mr Tan received a telephone call from one\n\nBilly Goh, a representative of the Second Defendant, informing him that the original\n\ninvoice was ready for collection. He told Billy that he would collect it from his office\n\nat about 12 noon that day.106 When he arrived at the place of business of the Second Defendant,\n\nBilly was waiting for him at the reception area and handed him a Tax Invoice and a\n\nDelivery Order both signed by the said Peter Lim and bearing the Second Defendant’s\n\nletterhead with its Singapore business address and telephone numbers stated. The Delivery\n\nOrder, under \"Delivery Instructions\", stated \"Via : Road, Vessel/Flight :\n\nBy Lorry\" and that the Country of Origin was from Singapore to Selangor, Malaysia.\n\nBoth documents stated the delivery date as 1 August 1998.107 On 14 September 1998, Mr Tan made another telephone call to the\n\nFirst Defendant to enquire whether the kits could be purchased from the First Defendant\n\ndirect. He was informed that the kits should be purchased from the Second Defendant, the\n\nSingapore distributors.",
        "THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE": "108 Professor Norman L. Letvin is a Professor of Medicine at Harvard\n\nMedical School and the Chief, Division of Viral Pathogenesis, Beth Israel Deaconess\n\nMedical Centre in Boston, Massachusetts. He has studied AIDS at Harvard since 1982 and has\n\npublished extensively on AIDS, HIV and SIV.109 He testified that the antigen used in HIV Blot 2.2 was a synthetic\n\npeptide that included the 18 mer found in many isolates of SIV and HIV-2. A search of all\n\nSIV and HIV-2 sequences reported to Genbank as of 20 April 1999 revealed that 38 of 116\n\nSIV sequences and 69 of 109 HIV-2 sequences contained the identical 18 mer sequence.\n\nGenbank is a database of publicly available genetic information maintained and\n\nadministered by the National Institutes of Health in USA. Five out of the 23 amino acid\n\npeptide used by the First Defendant were not found in any corresponding position in any\n\nsequence disclosed in the Patent. The 23 amino acid peptide was not found in any isolate\n\nof HIV-2 or SIV and not disclosed in the Patent.110 SIV was first isolated from macaques with an AIDS-like syndrome but\n\nwhich were not infected with HIV-1, and HIV-2 was first isolated from cells of humans with\n\nclinical AIDS but with no evidence of HIV-1 infection.111 Before the priority date (22 January 1986), Professor Letvin\n\nco-authored an article isolating and characterizing the envelope glycoprotein of SIVMACin Science on 7 June 1985. The envelope glycoproteins GP160 and GP120 from SIV were\n\nisolated and purified by radio immunoprecipitation (RIP). These proteins were shown to be\n\nstrongly immuno-reactive with sera obtained from the blood of SIV-infected monkeys.\n\nInterestingly, these proteins were also shown to be weakly immuno-reactive with sera from\n\nconfirmed HIV-1 infected patients. To the best of his knowledge, this was the first public\n\ndisclosure of the isolation and purification of the SIV envelope glycoproteins. The 18 mer\n\nused in the HIV 2.2 kit was actually found in the envelope glycoprotein of many strains of\n\nSIV. In the same volume of the journal, Professor Letvin and his co-authors also reported\n\non the isolation and characterization of SIV from captive macaques inflicted with an\n\nimmune deficiency disorder similar to AIDS. To the best of his knowledge, that was the\n\nfirst public disclosure of any SIV strain.112 On 22 November 1985, Kanki-2 described the isolation and\n\ncharacterization of a second SIV strain from wild-caught African green monkeys. The\n\nauthors also wrote that the envelope glycoprotein of SIV might be useful in diagnosing\n\ninfection by SIV and other closely related viruses. In the Patent, the First Plaintiff\n\nacknowledged the teaching of the Kanki-2 prior art, i.e. that SIV envelope glycoproteins\n\nwere useful in detecting HIV-2 infection. Since the 18 mer was found in the envelope\n\nglycoprotein of many strains of SIV, the First Defendant’s use of the SIV 18 mer to\n\ndetect HIV-2 infection constituted practice of public domain art disclosed in Kanki-1 and\n\nKanki-2.113 Barin, on 21 December 1985, presented serological evidence that a\n\nvirus closely related to SIV infected humans in West Africa. Sera from 20 Senegalese\n\nprostitutes and five surgical patients, all of whom were deemed healthy and apparently\n\ninfected with some strain of HIV, were examined for the presence of antibodies to HIV-1\n\nand SIVAGM. The antibodies present in the sera from the patients reacted more\n\nstrongly with SIVAGMproteins than with HIV-1 proteins. Barin studied the\n\nviruses obtained from the Senegalese prostitutes and patients and reported that the virus\n\nthey found was more closely related to SIVAGM(or STLVAGM) than to\n\nreference strains of HIV-1 (or HTLV-III). Barin therefore represented the first report of\n\nHIV-2 and the first purification of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-2.114 Kanki-1, Kanki-2 and Daniel suggested the possibility of using SIV\n\nenvelope glycoproteins for detecting viruses related to SIV and Barin actually\n\ndemonstrated that sera from humans infected with a SIV-like virus (HIV-2) was\n\nimmuno-reactive with SIV envelope proteins.115 Professor Letvin went on to say that the First Defendant’s 2.2\n\nkit used a prior art SIV sequence (the 18 mer) and that the use of SIV antigens to detect\n\nviral infection was suggested in the prior art. For Claim 19, a person skilled in the art\n\nwould not be able to a priori select the 18 mer out of the 891 amino acids provided in\n\nthat Claim as a useful antigen in detecting HIV-2 infection. There was no teaching in the\n\nPatent that would lead a skilled person to look at this specific 18 mer when there were\n\n873 contiguous distinct 18 mers in the envelope glycoprotein. Further, the antigen used in\n\nthe 2.2 kit was one not found in the Patent or in any HIV-2 or SIV strain.116 Professor Letvin was of the opinion, along with many other experts,\n\nthat the various strains of HIV-2 were in fact SIV strains that crossed into humans from\n\nsimians. The possible transmission of SIV into humans was also recognized by Barin and\n\nothers as far back as 1989. It is now widely accepted by most of Professor Letvin’s\n\ncolleagues that HIV-2 represented zoonotic transmission of SIV into humans. Thus all of\n\nthe viral strains identified as HIV-2 were in fact SIV strains transmitted to humans from\n\nsimians.117 During the prosecution of the Patent, the First Plaintiff had\n\nrelied on alleged differences in the molecular weights of SIV and HIV-2 proteins to prove\n\nthat the two were not the same virus. However, the assertion that SIV and HIV-2 proteins\n\ndid not match was contradicted directly at least twice in the Patent specifications where\n\nthe First Plaintiff characterized the envelope glycoproteins of SIV and HIV as having the\n\nsame molecular weight of 130-140 kilodaltons and having the same immuno-reactivity. The\n\nassertion that the distinguishing characteristic between SIV and HIV-2 was molecular\n\nweight was thus unfounded. The molecular weights of every SIV and HIV-2 protein in fact\n\nfell within a 10% range. Every protein found in HIV-2 was also found in SIV and could not\n\nbe distinguished based on molecular weight nor by immunological properties.118 It was not surprising that the molecular weights and immunological\n\nproperties of the proteins of the two viruses were indistinguishable as SIV and HIV-2 were\n\nstrains of the same virus, HIV-2 being SIV that crossed over into humans from monkeys.119 In oral testimony, Professor Letvin explained further that we now\n\nknow that all of the viruses that caused AIDS in man originated in non-human primates,\n\ni.e. the African monkeys and apes. In their natural host species, these viruses caused no\n\ndisease. However, when they crossed over to man and to Asian monkeys, AIDS could occur.\n\nThe HIV-1 originated in the chimpanzee, which did not develop AIDS, and spread from there\n\nthroughout mankind. Similarly, a naturally occurring virus in the sootey mangabey resulted\n\nin HIV-2 when it was transmitted from monkeys to man. SIVSMcaused no disease\n\nin its natural host but when it infected Asian monkeys, they developed AIDS.120 The SIVMACwas a SIVSMtransmitted into the\n\nAsian macaque monkey. SIVSM= HIV-2 and SIVSM= SIVMAC.\n\nAccordingly, all three viruses were essentially the same virus. There were minor\n\nvariations in the genetic sequences but they were so closely related that they ought to be\n\nviewed as different isolates of the same virus.121 After isolating the first SIVMAC, it was known that it\n\ncould cause AIDS. Everyone therefore treated the virus as a potentially lethal virus for\n\nman. It was reported in two publications in 1990 and 1991 that SIVs clearly could infect\n\nhumans. It was also currently known that SIVSMcould infect humans and cause\n\nAIDS. While there was no published literature on this, the Centre for Disease Control in\n\nAtlanta, Georgia, USA had documentation of humans infected with SIVSMwho\n\nclearly had AIDS. This was not surprising since SIVSM= SIVMAC=\n\nHIV-2.122 Each taken by itself, the prior art articles of Daniel, Kanki-1,\n\nand Barin, did not necessarily predict that a virus similar to SIVMACcould\n\ninfect and cause AIDS in man. However, taken together, the observations in the three\n\narticles clearly indicated to the scientific community that a SIV-like virus infected and\n\ncould well cause AIDS in man. Taken together, Daniel and Kanki-1 indicated that a new\n\nvirus (SIVMAC) existed and could cause AIDS in monkeys and Barin’s\n\nobservation that humans could be infected by a virus closely related to SIVMACpredicted very clearly at that time that an AIDS virus related to SIVMACwould\n\nbe found in humans.123 At the time of publication of Barin’s article, while some of\n\nProfessor Letvin’s colleagues hoped that this virus would not cause AIDS in man, many\n\nof them assumed that it would eventually cause AIDS in humans, based on the knowledge that\n\nthere could be an average ten-year gap between infection and the onset of AIDS for HIV-1.\n\nAnyone skilled in the art should have expected the possibility of an AIDS illness in\n\nhumans infected with a virus similar to SIVMAC.124 HIV-1 makes a protein called vpu and not vpx while HIV-2 does not\n\nmake vpu but vpx. SIVMAC, like HIV-2, also does not make vpu but vpx, showing a\n\nvery close relationship between these two.125 In cross-examination, Professor Letvin said that his five existing\n\npatents and five pending ones related mainly to AIDS and to immunology observations and\n\ndiscoveries. He agreed that some people might say that he possessed an inventive mind but\n\ndisagreed that he was thereby more than the notional man skilled in the art. In his\n\nopinion, there were many people working in AIDS research who would have brought the same\n\nunderstanding and perspective as he had.126 Professor Letvin agreed that the test kits available as at the\n\npriority date of 22 January 1986 were intended for testing HIV-1 only. Test kits, however,\n\nalways lacked behind the knowledge in AIDS research. The available commercial kits were\n\ninefficient for detecting the SIV and HIV-2 family.127 Professor Letvin co-authored Daniel’s article published on 7\n\nJune 1985. He agreed that there was nothing in that article which stated that SIVMACcould be used to test for AIDS in humans or that SIV would infect humans. However, since\n\nthe first isolation of that virus occurred in his laboratory, there was concern among\n\nfellow researchers that it could infect man and cause AIDS. Extensive guidelines on how\n\nthe virus must be worked with were established by the Harvard University Committee on\n\nBiological Safety even before the publication of Daniel. The article did not mention the\n\nterms HIV-2 or SIV as those terms did not exist then. There was no discussion in Daniel of\n\nthis virus infecting humans or of the viral proteins. Neither was there any mention of\n\namino acid sequences, in particular the 18 mer.128 Professor Letvin also co-authored Kanki-1 published also on 7 June\n\n1985. His comments concerning Daniel would apply to Kanki-1 as well. However the proteins\n\nof SIVMACand consequently of HIV-2 were revealed here. Asked to point out\n\nwhere the 18 mer appeared in Kanki-1, Professor Letvin said he could not show it but there\n\nwas a description in Daniel and Kanki-1 of a virus and those skilled in the art would have\n\nbeen able to clone and sequence the amino acids of that virus. One could predict the 18\n\nmer or at least devise a series of peptides similar to the 18 mer.129 Kanki-2 published on 22 November 1985 was not co-authored by\n\nProfessor Letvin. The virus there was SIVAGM(or STLV-IIIAGM).\n\nAgain, no sequence was revealed here but Professor Letvin’s earlier comments on\n\nKanki-1 were applicable here. There was also no statement in the article that the virus\n\ncaused AIDS in humans but the Harvard Committee had determined at that time that any virus\n\nassociated with the African green monkey must be treated as though it could cause AIDS in\n\nman.130 Barin was published on 21 December 1985. Professor Letvin was not\n\none of the authors. Most readers of Barin felt that a virus of this type in the Senegalese\n\nwomen might well cause AIDS in humans. While no virus isolation was described in Barin,\n\nanyone learned in this field could have isolated the virus. It could be inferred from the\n\narticle that Barin hoped that the virus would not cause AIDS but many serious scientists\n\ndiscussing this at meetings and over the telephone at that time were not as optimistic.\n\nThe proteins of what was now called HIV-2 could be clearly inferred from Barin.131 Although a subsequent article revealed that the virus in\n\nBarin’s was actually a contaminated SIVMACculture, that did not take away\n\nBarin’s conclusion that humans infected by an AIDS virus reacted with SIVMAC.\n\nProfessor Letvin disagreed that todate no one knew exactly what the virus in the\n\nSenegalese women in Barin’s article was. It had been shown that it was very closely\n\nrelated to the SIVMACand one could assume that it was what was now called\n\nHIV-2.132 Professor Letvin was then referred to an article communicated in\n\nJuly 1985 and published in October 1985 in which he was a co-author. This was published\n\njust before Kanki-2 and Barin and three months before the priority date of the Patent.\n\nAsked whether the authors of this article thought that SIV differed from HIV, Professor\n\nLetvin said he was referring to HIV-1 and was comparing SIVMACwith HIV-1 when\n\nhe referred to the \"human AIDS virus\" as there was much controversy then on the\n\nterminology to use. He agreed that he thought SIVMACwas different from HIV-1.133 Professor Letvin disagreed that the discovery of HIV-2 was a major\n\nturning point for AIDS research as 98% of all AIDS cases worldwide were due to HIV-1. The\n\ndiscovery of HIV-2 was important for screening bloodbanks and for studying the\n\nepidemiology worldwide. If he was so concerned with patents, he would have patented SIVMACbut he did not because he was a scientist not concerned so much with personal gain.134 According to Professor Letvin, SIVMAChad been described\n\nbefore the priority date and HIV-2 was therefore not new since it was SIVMAC.HIV-2\n\nwas also obvious because in December 1985, Barin had indicated that that virus was in\n\nhuman populations. Once the virus was described before the priority date, the cloning, the\n\nsequence and the prediction of the peptides were obvious to anyone skilled in the art. The\n\nsequence of SIVMACand of SIVAGMwere not in the literature before\n\nthe priority date. The first time the HIV-2 sequence was published appeared to be on 16\n\nApril 1987 in Guyader’s article. A skilled man would then be able to look for the 18\n\nmer.135 Professor Letvin agreed that he had not referred to SIVSMin his AEIC but only in oral testimony in Court.136 Asked whether there was evidence of zoonotic transmission of the\n\nSIV to man, Professor Letvin replied that it could be readily inferred from the data that\n\nsuch a transmission had taken place. In the wild, sootey mangabey monkeys were infected\n\nwith SIVSMuniversally but did not become ill. This suggested strongly that\n\nsootey mangabey was the reservoir for the HIV-2. It was known at the priority date that\n\nSIVMACand HIV-2 were so similar as to be indistinguishable. He based his\n\nconclusion on zoonotic transmission on an article by Hirsch published on 1 June 1989.137 The second witness for the First Defendant was Dr Guan Ming, the\n\nManager of the Product Development Division in the First Defendant. Dr Guan Ming graduated\n\nwith a Ph.D. in biological sciences from the University of Exeter in 1989 and has been\n\nwith the First Defendant since January 1990.138 Dr Guan Ming stated that the First Defendant was principally\n\ninvolved in the research, development, manufacture and sale of diagnostic kits for the\n\ndetection of infectious diseases, its core business being the manufacture and sale of\n\nWestern Blot HIV and HTLV diagnostic kits and associated instruments/software. When he\n\njoined the First Defendant, he was involved with a team doing research, development,\n\nmanufacture and commercialization of peptides for diagnostic use. In 1986 or so, the First\n\nDefendant started research on the development of a diagnostic kit for the detection of\n\nHIV-2 infection. In 1988, research work was also started in collaboration with DuPont on\n\nthe development of a diagnostic kit for the detection of HIV-1 and HIV-2.139 Dr Guan Ming then provided some explanation of terms such as virus,\n\nretrovirus and HIV genome and gave a brief history of HIV and SIV. In 1983, researchers at\n\nthe National Cancer Institute, USA and in Paris, France co-discovered the HIV-1. The\n\nFrench researchers called the new virus LAV (Lymphadenopathy Associated Virus) while the\n\nAmericans referred to it as HTLV-III (Human T-Cell Lymphotropic Virus III). An\n\ninternational commission subsequently standardized the name to HIV to avoid confusion.140 In mid-1985, a group of research scientists at Harvard School of\n\nPublic Health (which included Professor Letvin) isolated a new simian retrovirus from a\n\nmacaque closely related to HIV-1. They named it STLV-III or SIV. They reported later in\n\nDecember 1985 that human sera from West Africa contained antibodies which reacted more\n\nreadily with SIV than with HIV-1. This was serological evidence of a strain of SIV which\n\nhad the capacity to infect humans and which they subsequently named HTLV-IV. These\n\nfindings were echoed by another group of researchers who isolated a virus from West\n\nAfrican patients which was found to be more closely related to SIV than to HIV-1, both in\n\nmolecular weight and in immunological properties. This second group named the virus HIV-2.141 HIV attacks the immune system in the human body. When a person was\n\ninfected with HIV-1 or HIV-2, he would develop virus-specific antibodies in his\n\nbloodstream, usually within a few weeks. Hence, diagnostic kits to detect the presence of\n\nsuch antibodies were used to test whether a person was infected with HIV.142 Immuno assay is one of the methods used for the serological\n\ndiagnosis of infection. The ELISA method is one such assay for the detection of specific\n\nantibodies. Although it is relatively inexpensive and simple to use, there may be cases\n\nwhere a positive or negative assessment may be difficult. It is also subject to\n\ncross-reactivity by non-specific antibodies. The screening results of ELISA are usually\n\nconfirmed by additional highly specific tests which, if performed or interpreted properly,\n\nusually do not produce false biologic positive results. One of these confirmatory tests is\n\nthe Western Blot.143 The Western Blot is generally considered the gold standard for\n\nconfirming the presence of HIV. It works on the same principle of antigen-antibody\n\nreaction. If the relevant antibody has formed a complex with any of the banded HIV\n\nproteins on the nitrocellulose strip, a colour reaction occurs at the band site. While the\n\nELISA can only provide a Yes or No answer, the Western Blot can provide information on the\n\npresence of a specific antibody or antibodies.144 The First Defendant’s 1.2 kit incorporates the HIV-2 antigenic\n\nproteins on the test strip. The 2.2 kit incorporates bands of HIV-1 antigenic proteins on\n\nthe test strip to confirm HIV-1 infection. It also includes a synthetic peptide band to\n\ndetect HIV-2 infection. This is a unique feature of the 2.2 kit. While other kits could\n\ndetect only HIV-1 or HIV-2, the 2.2 kit could detect both.145 The complete genetic sequence of HIV-2 comprises about 9900\n\nnucleotides. It could not be said with certainty where all the antigenic sites were on the\n\nHIV-2. Not all parts of the virus had antigenic effect. Determining the antigenic sites\n\nwas an expensive and time-consuming exercise. The First Defendant was guided by the\n\nliterature available which allowed for an educated trial and error approach, in particular\n\nan article by John Gnann in Science 1987. Gnann had a 12 mer peptide sequence.146 Eventually, the First Defendant, after extensive research,\n\ndevelopment and consultation, used a HIV-2 synthetic peptide component supplied by DuPont\n\npursuant to a development agreement. After much experimentation, the First Defendant\n\ndiscovered the 18 mer sequence which included Gnann’s 12 mer peptide sequence.\n\nFurther, to improve the binding effect of the peptide to the strip and hence improve the\n\nefficiency and accuracy of the test, five additional amino acids were added to one end of\n\nthe 18 mer sequence to produce a 23 mer peptide. This sequence of five amino acids was not\n\nfound in any part of the sequence of amino acids in the HIV-2.147 The peptide was first synthesized on 14 January 1990 and tested for\n\n15 months. The First Defendant then started selling the 2.2 kit in the second quarter of\n\n1991 and filed a patent application for a HIV-1/HIV-2 viral detection kit and method in\n\nthe USA, which was subsequently granted.148 Despite the publication of the First Plaintiff’s Patent,\n\nresearchers in 1991 were still struggling to identify the antigenic sites in the HIV\n\nvirus. There was nothing in the Patent that taught or directed researchers that the 18 mer\n\nwould be useful in detecting HIV-2 infection and that it had the ability to distinguish\n\nbetween HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection.149 Dr Guan Ming’s views on Claim 19 were that it was so wide it\n\ncould cover antigens not only from HIV-2 but also SIV that could react with HIV-2\n\nantibodies. There was also insufficient disclosure as it did not pinpoint which specific\n\npart or parts of the sequence was able to raise a specific immunological reaction with the\n\nHIV-2 antibodies. As stated earlier, researchers were still trying in 1991 to establish\n\nwhich proteins could be used for the specific detection of HIV-2. It could not be that the\n\nFirst Plaintiff could claim rights over all parts of the virus having antigenic effect\n\nwhen it could not identify what they were and hence did not disclose them in the Patent.150 The First Defendant’s 23 mer did not fall within any of the\n\nFirst Plaintiff’s Claims.151 As for Claim 34 concerning processes, Dr Guan Ming was of the\n\nopinion that it covered processes using antigens disclosed in the prior art which could\n\nreact with HIV-2 antibodies. There was also insufficient disclosure.152 Accordingly, Dr Guan Ming concluded, the First Defendant had not\n\ninfringed the First Plaintiff’s Patent.153 Asked in cross-examination what peptide DuPont gave to the First\n\nDefendant, Dr Guan Ming replied that he did not have the records concerning that but it\n\nwas a peptide that the First Defendant did not use. The team in the First Defendant\n\nderived a peptide themselves, relying on Gnann’s teachings. (DuPont had been sued as\n\nan infringer of the Patent in 1988 and had to take a licence from the Plaintiffs in 1990\n\nas part of a settlement agreement). Dr Guan Ming was not aware of the suit against DuPont\n\nand did not know why the collaboration with DuPont was halted. The First Defendant learnt\n\nfrom DuPont’s peptide that size made a difference. The First Defendant had made many\n\npeptides before the DuPont peptide was provided.154 Dr Guan Ming agreed that the additional five amino acids were for\n\nthe purpose of improving the binding effect of the 18 mer. Their hydrophilic properties\n\n(i.e. the ability to dissolve into water more easily) had been known for a long time. The\n\nfive amino acids helped in sticking and in dissolving. Although they had no\n\nimmuno-reactivity of their own, their absence would affect the performance of the peptide\n\ntesting. They therefore improved the performance of the peptide a great deal.155 The First Defendant did not take the 18 mer from the SIVMACsequences.156 Dr Guan Ming agreed that Guyader’s article in April 1987 was\n\nin the first occasion that the complete sequence of HIV-2 was published and that\n\nGnann’s article in July 1987 acknowledged Guyader’s when Gnann came up with his\n\n12 mer immunodominant region. He said however that he had received very confusing\n\ninformation in that there were people looking for a workable peptide even in 1991.157 Mr Eric Mun Ping Kuen is the Managing Director of the First\n\nDefendant. He informed the Court that the First Defendant was a fully-owned subsidiary of\n\nGenelabs Technologies Inc of Redwood City, California. The First Defendant has fully-owned\n\nsubsidiaries in other countries which function as marketing and sales organizations. The\n\nFirst Defendant employs more than 60 employees of whom some 54 are located in Singapore.\n\nThe company has an average turnover of US$10 million for the past three years. Its\n\nproducts are widely accepted and well regarded all over the world. It has also received\n\nvarious research grants from statutory boards here. The company and its parent have\n\napplied for and obtained a number of patents worldwide and the First Defendant also holds\n\nlicences from other patent owners.158 The First Defendant’s 1.2 and 2.2 diagnostic kits were\n\nlaunched in late 1987 and in 1991 respectively.159 The Second Defendant was appointed the First Defendant’s\n\nexclusive distributor in Malaysia in June 1997. At no time did the First Defendant discuss\n\nwith the Second Defendant the subject of patent rights, particularly the Patent in issue.160 The First Defendant and its parent company had on-going business\n\nrelationships with the Second Plaintiff since 1990 or so. Since late 1991, there were\n\nnegotiations between the First Defendant and the Second Plaintiff on the use of the HIV-2.\n\nThe First Defendant had developed and launched the 2.2 kit then and knowing that the\n\nPlaintiffs had a patent on the HIV-2, assumed that a licence would be required. The\n\nnegotiations included the possibility of cross-licensing of the HIV-2 Patent with the\n\nFirst Defendant’s parent company’s patents. After two years of negotiations, the\n\nSecond Plaintiff unilaterally and abruptly terminated discussions in late December 1993.161 The First Defendant attempted to re-open discussions in 1994 and\n\n1995 but was rebuffed. Todate, the First Defendant and the Second Plaintiff or its related\n\ncompanies still enjoy a mutually beneficial business relationship.162 Mr Eric Mun went on to state that the Plaintiffs’ inactivity\n\nand apparent disinterest in their Patent over the past nine years made it inequitable for\n\nthe Plaintiffs to now seek the relief sought and to stop the First Defendant from selling\n\nproducts contributing at least 25% of the company’s revenue. Substantial time and\n\nmoney had been invested over the last decade on the two kits which could have been spent\n\non other projects had the Plaintiffs not led the First Defendant to believe that they did\n\nnot object to the use of the HIV-2. Any injunction or damages ordered would have a severe\n\nimpact on the continued viability of the company.163 In cross-examination, Mr Eric Mun said he was aware of the Second\n\nDefendant’s letter dated 23 December 1993 warning against Patent infringement but the\n\nFirst Defendant did not normally discuss patent issues with its distributors. It was the\n\ncompany’s general policy to have an indemnity clause for distributors in distribution\n\nagreements.164 He stated that there was no record of any authorization from the\n\nPlaintiffs that the First Defendant could market its test kits. Asked about the First\n\nPlaintiff’s letter dated 30 June 1997 to its sister company in Taiwan, Mr Eric Mun\n\nagreed that it was a warning letter. However, the First Defendant’s head office had\n\nresponded by saying that their activities did not fall within the scope of the Taiwan\n\npatent.165 Mr Eric Mun explained further that as a small company which was\n\nbeginning to launch its products, it was the general practice to ask for licences,\n\ncross-licences and collaborations. The First Defendant was not in the business of\n\nchallenging the validity of Patents. Because of the long relationship with the Plaintiffs,\n\nthe First Defendant negotiated without questioning the Patent. Further, the First\n\nDefendant needed the approval of the USA Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\")\n\nfor its product and did not want its product to be hampered by Patent issues. Since 1987\n\nand 1991, the First Defendant had advertised and promoted its products in trade journals\n\nand at AIDS conferences.166 Mr Mark Van Asten joined the First Defendant in 1993. He held\n\ndiscussions with the President of the USA Subsidiary of the Second Plaintiff on the\n\npossibility of a cross-licensing arrangement in respect of the HIV-2 Patent. Prior to his\n\njoining the First Defendant, the company had initiated some informal communication with\n\nthe Plaintiffs on the possibility of obtaining a licence for the HIV-2. The commercial\n\nintent of the First Defendant was to enter the USA market for which approval from the FDA\n\nwas necessary. As the approval process would take time and require a high level of\n\ninvestment, it made strategic sense and was prudent to approach the Plaintiffs regarding\n\nthe HIV-2 Patent. No agreement was reached but the Second Plaintiff appeared seriously\n\nreceptive to the proposals.167 It came as a surprise to the First Defendant when it learnt that a\n\nletter dated 23 December 1993 had been received from the Second Plaintiff terminating all\n\nnegotiations on the HIV-2 and warning against infringement. Mr Van Asten therefore wrote\n\non 11 January 1994 to find out the cause for the sudden change in position and attitude.\n\nHis attempts to meet with the Second Plaintiff for further discussions were rejected\n\nalthough the door to other matters were left open.168 On 25 February 1994, he received a letter from the Second\n\nPlaintiff’s subsidiary stating that it did not wish to license its HIV-2 rights to\n\nthe First Defendant in the six territories (mentioned earlier in this judgment) and again\n\nwarning against infringement.169 On 18 March 1994, he wrote to the Second Plaintiff on further\n\nproposals. When the First Defendant heard nothing from the Second Plaintiff or its\n\nsubsidiary after that, the First Defendant continued to manufacture and sell the testing\n\nkits.170 In an article printed in AIDS 1993 (a foremost specialized medical\n\njournal on AIDS), the First Defendant’s test kits were listed among the types of test\n\nkits available in the USA market together with the Second Plaintiff’s test kits.171 Between 1991 and 1997, the First Defendant also advertised,\n\nexhibited and promoted its test kits at several international conferences, most of which\n\nwere attended by the Plaintiffs’ representatives. The First Defendant also published\n\nand presented scientific papers on its test kits in 1992 and 1993.172 From the termination of negotiations in late 1993 until the letter\n\nof demand dated 25 September 1998 from the Plaintiffs’ solicitors in Singapore, the\n\nPlaintiffs had not raised any issue nor complained to the First Defendant about its\n\nmanufacture and sale of the test kits.173 Asked whether he would, as a prudent businessman, confirm the\n\nvalidity of a Patent before requesting a licence, Mr Van Asten remarked that there was a\n\nhost of factors to consider, such as the business relationship with other companies,\n\nbesides the question of royalty fee. At the internal meetings of the First Defendant, no\n\nreason to be concerned about infringement for the 2.2 kit surfaced. That had been marketed\n\nbetween 1991 to 1993 without objection or complaint from the Second Plaintiff. The\n\nlaunching of the product in the USA was the primary concern for discussing with the Second\n\nPlaintiff. After the termination of negotiations, the First Defendant went ahead with the\n\nsale of the kits because it believed that there was no infringement of the Patent. His\n\nsubsequent letters to the Second Plaintiff were to explore business opportunities, not\n\nnecessarily in respect of HIV-2, and were not attempts to get the HIV-2 licence or to\n\ndevelop business opportunities concerning only the HIV-2. The First Defendant’s\n\ninternal legal counsel’s concerns about the need to disclose to the Security Exchange\n\nCommission the inability to obtain the HIV-2 licence (as part of the financial disclosure)\n\nwere expressed in the context of the situation as at end of December 1993 when the First\n\nDefendant had received only the first warning letter.174 Mr Van Asten was not aware of the First Plaintiff’s letter\n\ndated 25 June 2997 to the Taiwanese authorities when he said there was no complaint\n\nbetween 1993 until the letter of demand in 1998.175 Although neither the Second Plaintiff nor its subsidiary authorized\n\nnor informed the First Defendant that it could sell the kits, the First Defendant was in\n\nfact doing so without any legal action being taken against the company. The First\n\nDefendant believed there was no infringement. Some 12 months after the warning letters,\n\nthe Second Plaintiff’s principal officers visited the First Defendant’s parent\n\ncompany without raising the issue of the Patent in any form. In Mr Van Asten’s view,\n\nthe 1993 and 1994 letters were \"posturing\" rather than warning letters.176 In the light of all the matters between 1991 to 1993 that he had\n\ntestified about, he found it difficult to believe that the Plaintiffs did not realize that\n\nthe First Defendant was selling the kits until 1996.177 The only witness from the Second Defendant was Mr Peter Lim Kee\n\nHock, the General Manager of the Second Defendant’s Chemical and Healthcare Division.\n\nThe Second Defendant was incorporated in 1975 and has been principally in the business of\n\ndistributing engineering and commodity plastics and chemicals. On 1 June 1997, the Second\n\nDefendant entered into an agreement with the First Defendant to be the sole distributor in\n\nMalaysia of the First Defendant’s HIV diagnostic kits. Most of the sales were made to\n\nhospitals, clinics and laboratories.178 Until the Second Defendant received the Plaintiffs’\n\nsolicitors’ letter of 25 September 1998 concerning alleged Patent infringement, the\n\nSecond Defendant was not aware of the Patent at all. No one had informed the Second\n\nDefendant about the Patent, that a patent existed for such products or about the owners of\n\nthe Patent. Prior to the appointment, Mr Peter Lim had been informed by the First\n\nDefendant that it had been distributing the test kits since 1988 in Singapore without any\n\nproblems. Surprised by the said letter, he forwarded a copy thereof to the First Defendant\n\non 30 September 1998. The kits had been approved for sale by the health authorities and\n\nthere was nothing which indicated that they could not be sold. The Second Defendant has\n\nbeen selling the kits for two years in Malaysia.179 Mr Peter Lim testified that he had not seen the correspondence\n\nbetween the First Defendant or its affiliates and the Second Plaintiff or its affiliates\n\nconcerning licensing of the Patent or warning about infringement thereof. This was the\n\nfirst time that the Second Defendant had entered the health product business and it was\n\ntherefore not familiar with patent issues at all. If the First Defendant had disclosed the\n\nfailed negotiations to him, the Second Defendant would not have entered into the\n\ndistribution agreement. He assumed that the First Defendant did possess the necessary\n\nrights since it signed the agreement.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "180 Before the advent of our present Patents Act, there was no\n\nmachinery for examining patent applications here. A party seeking patent protection here\n\nhad to obtain a patent in the United Kingdom and then register it under the Registration\n\nof United Kingdom Patents Act. On 23 February 1995, the Patents Act (save for a couple of\n\nsections) came into operation. The transitional provision in Section 116(3) of the Act\n\npreserves patents registered under the repealed Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act\n\nas if they were granted under the Patents Act, which is modelled on the United Kingdom\n\nPatents Act 1977.181 Section 82(1)(a) of the Patents Act provides that the validity of a\n\npatent may be put in issue by way of defence in proceedings for infringement of the\n\npatent. The onus of proving invalidity is on the alleged infringer because validity is\n\npresumed. Section 82(3) provides that the only grounds on which the validity of a patent\n\nmay be put in issue are those on which the patent may be revoked under Section 80. Section\n\n80, in turn, allows the Registrar of Patents to revoke a patent on various grounds, the\n\nrelevant ones of which are:\"(a) the invention is not a patentable invention;…(c) the specification of the patent does not disclose the invention\n\n    clearly and completely for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art;…\"182 What then is a patentable invention? This is defined in Section\n\n13(1) as one that satisfies the following conditions:\"(a) the invention is new;(b) it involves an inventive step; and(c) it is capable of industrial application.\"Condition (c) is not in issue in these proceedings.183 On the issue of newness, the challenge to which is usually referred\n\nto as anticipation or lack of novelty, Section 14 explains as follows:\"14. (1) An invention shall be taken to be new if it does not form\n\n  part of the state of the art.(2) The state of the art in the case of an invention shall be taken to\n\n  comprise all matter (whether a product, a process, information about either, or anything\n\n  else) which has at any time before the priority date of that invention been made available\n\n  to the public (whether in Singapore or elsewhere) by written or oral description, by use\n\n  or in any other way.(3) The state of the art in the case of an invention to which an\n\n  application for a patent or a patent relates shall be taken also to comprise matter\n\n  contained in an application for another patent which was published on or after the\n\n  priority date of that invention, if the following conditions are satisfied:(a) that matter was contained in the application for that other patent\n\n    both as filed and as published; and(b) the priority date of that matter is earlier than that of the\n\n    invention.\"184 On the second condition of inventive step, Section 15 provides:\"An invention shall be taken to involve an inventive step if it is\n\n  not obvious to a person skilled in the art, having regard to any matter which forms part\n\n  of the state of the art by virtue only of Section 14(2) and without having regard to\n\n  Section 14(3).\"185 The priority date in the present case is undeniably 22 January\n\n1986.186 Section 113(1) defines \"invention\" as:\"113. (1) For the purposes of this Act, an invention for a patent\n\n  for which an application has been made or for which a patent has been granted shall,\n\n  unless the context otherwise requires, be taken to be that specified in a claim of the\n\n  specification of the application or patent, as the case may be, as interpretated by the\n\n  description and any drawings contained in that specification, and the extent of the\n\n  protection conferred by a patent or application for a patent shall be determined\n\n  accordingly.\"Section 25(4) stipulates that the specification of an application shall\n\ndisclose the invention in a manner which is clear and complete for the invention to be\n\nperformed by a person skilled in the art. Section 25(5) provides that the claim or claims\n\nshall:(a) define the matter for which the applicant seeks protection;(b) be clear and concise;(c) be supported by the description; and(d) relate to one invention or to a group of inventions which are so\n\n  linked as to form a single inventive concept.",
        "The validity of the Patent.": "187 A prior art document should be construed as at the date it was\n\npublished. In construing such a document, one must guard against interpreting it with\n\nhindsight or with knowledge that is acquired after the priority date. An invention lacks\n\nnovelty or is anticipated if it has been disclosed to the public before the priority date.\n\nInGeneral Tire & Rubber Co. v Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co Ltd[1972] RPC 457, the English Court of Appeal said:\"To determine whether a patentee’s claim has been anticipated\n\n  by an earlier publication it is necessary to compare the earlier publication with the\n\n  patentee’s claim. The earlier publication must, for this purpose, be interpreted as\n\n  at the date of its publication, having regard to the relevant surrounding circumstances\n\n  which then existed, and without regard to subsequent events. The patentee’s claim\n\n  must similarly be construed as at its own date of publication having regard to the\n\n  relevant surrounding circumstances then existing. If the earlier publication, so\n\n  construed, discloses the same device as the device which the patentee by his claim, so\n\n  construed, asserts that he has invented, the patentee’s claim has been anticipated,\n\n  but not otherwise.\"Although this case concerns the United Kingdom Patents Act 1949, it is\n\nconsidered good law under the United Kingdom Patents Act 1977 and has been followed and\n\napplied (Asahi Kasei Kogyo KK’s Application[1991] RPC 485;PLG Research\n\nLtd v Ardon International Ltd[1993] FSR 197;Merrell Dow Pharmaceutical Inc v\n\nNorton & Co Ltd[1995] RPC 233).188 The law concerning anticipation is strict to the patentee and to\n\nthe challenger of the patent. A claim is invalid if it covers any item of the prior art\n\nwhich has been disclosed to anyone (except in confidence), by any means (written or oral\n\nor by use), anywhere in the world, at any time in history (before the priority date). Even\n\navailability to a single member of the public will suffice. Similarly, availability to the\n\npublic is satisfied if the document can be found on the shelves of a public library. It is\n\nirrelevant whether anyone knew it was available or had inspected it. [Vitoria,\n\nEncyclopedia of United Kingdom and European Patent Law] Anticipation can therefore\n\nencompass a disclosure which the inventor was totally ignorant of.189 Similarly, anticipation does not include vague disclosures or near\n\nmisses. As the Court of Appeal inGeneral Tiresaid:\"To anticipate the patentee’s claim the prior publication\n\n  must contain clear and unmistakable directions to do what the patentee claims to have\n\n  invented\".190 Anticipation must be found within the document alleged to have\n\nanticipated the invention. It is not permissible to combine the teachings of two or more\n\ndocuments except where one of these directs the reader to study the other. One cannot\n\ncreate a \"mosaic of extracts\" from documents spread over a number of years [Von\n\nHeydon v Neustadt(1880) 50 LJ Ch. 126]. Similarly, \"it is not open to you to\n\ntake a packet of prior documents and by putting a puzzle together produce what you say is\n\na disclosure in the nature of a combination of the various elements which have been\n\ncontained in the prior documents. … it is necessary to point to a clear and specific\n\ndisclosure of something which is said to be like the patentee’s invention\" [Lowndes’\n\nPatent(1928) 45 RPC 48].191 Applying the principles pertaining to novelty, the prior art\n\ndocuments relied on by the Defendants, read individually or collectively, do not clearly\n\nand unmistakably disclose any antigen having the amino acid sequence or a part thereof as\n\ndescribed in Claim 19. The said Claim also deals with the function of detecting HIV-2.\n\nClaims 1 to 9 on the novelty of the HIV-2 have not been impugned. It would therefore be\n\nillogical to claim that prior art has already revealed the function of detecting a virus\n\nunknown to the prior art.192 Claim 33 is concerned with a process to detect a new virus. As\n\nstated above, if the virus is new or novel, the process to detect it must have the same\n\nattribute.193 On the issue of inventive step or obviousness,General Tireadvocated an objective test. Again, one must guard against looking at the issue with\n\nhindsight.194 \"A person skilled in the art\", like the \"reasonable\n\nman\", is a notional one. He is not \"the mechanician of genius nor … the\n\nmechanical idiot\" (Van der Lely N.V. v Bamfords Ltd[1961] RPC 296). He is\n\n\"assumed to be of standard competence at his work without being of an imaginative or\n\ninventive turn of mind\" (General Tire) or \"the normally skilled but\n\nunimaginative addressee in the art at the priority date\" (Windsurfing\n\nInternational Inc v Tabur Marine (Great Britain) Ltd[1985] RPC 59). He is \"not\n\nthe man of inventive imagination who might see straightaway what was required, but a\n\nhypothetical unimaginative technician skilled in the particular art\" (Van der Lely\n\nN.V. v Ruston’s Engineering Co Ltd[1985] RPC 461). Where more than one type of\n\nskill is required, this notional person may be a composite entity or a team.195 The proper approach to the question of obviousness is best\n\nsummarized by the EPO Guidelines C-IV 9.9 thus:\"It should be remembered that an invention which at first sight\n\n  appears obvious might in fact involve an inventive step. Once a new idea has been\n\n  formulated it can often be shown theoretically how it might have been arrived at, starting\n\n  from something known, by a series of apparently easy steps. The examiner should be wary ofex post factoanalysis of this kind. He should always bear in mind that the\n\n  documents produced in the search have, of necessity, been obtained with foreknowledge of\n\n  what matter constitutes the alleged invention. In all cases he should attempt to visualize\n\n  the overall state of the art confronting the skilled man before the applicant’s\n\n  contribution and he should seek to make a ‘real life’ assessment of this and\n\n  other relevant factors.\"196 It is axiomatic that the person skilled in the art will also\n\npossess common general knowledge which he will call upon.197 Inventiveness is not synonymous with complexity. An invention may\n\nwell be one because it is such a simple solution to what appears a highly complex problem.\n\nIt may sometimes be paradoxical that a simple solution ought to have been so obvious but\n\nwas not. Inventiveness may also reside not in designing a device to produce a particular\n\nresult but in appreciating what the result ought to be. Understanding the nature of a\n\nproblem may be part of the process of invention of a product needed to solve that problem.198 Bearing all this in mind, the inventive concept of Claim 19 was\n\nthat an antigen having the stated amino acid sequence had been discovered which was\n\ncapable of specifically bringing about the solution to a newly discovered problem, i.e.\n\nthe HIV-2. At the priority date, only two types of primate immunodeficiency virus were\n\nknown with another putative virus suggested in Barin which is unknown todate. It was also\n\na problem to find the HIV-2 and to identify and sequence the antigen of Claim 19.199 Did Barin reveal a virus which caused AIDS in man other than the\n\nknown HIV-1, thereby rendering the HIV-2 obvious? Barin did not think the virus in\n\nquestion was pathogenic to man. Some six months later, the same team of researchers was\n\nstill looking for a non-pathogenic human infecting retrovirus. With respect, if Professor\n\nLetvin and his colleagues felt differently from Barin, it was at best their hypothesis\n\nwhich was subsequently proven correct. It could not be said that Barin made the existence\n\nof HIV-2 obvious. That being the case, it must follow that it was not obvious to invent an\n\nantigen with the specified sequence capable of detecting that virus.200 None of the prior art writings contained any amino acid sequence,\n\nlet alone the 18 mer. All the SIV 18 mer sequences were submitted to Genbank after the\n\npriority date. At that date, no SIV sequence was known. The HIV-2RODwas the\n\nfirst sequence with the 18 mer. It was not possible for the prior art to envisage the use\n\nof SIV envelope glycoprotein to diagnose infection by HIV-2 when that virus was not even\n\nknown before the priority date.201 Where Claim 33 was concerned, the difference between the state of\n\nthe art and the invention was that there was previously no process for detecting HIV-2\n\n(being something not known then) and there was one invented in the Patent now. The\n\ninventiveness was manifested in the recognition that a new virus was responsible for\n\ncausing AIDS in the West African patients and providing the means to detect it by using an\n\nantigen. The First Plaintiff had discovered the \"lock\" and its \"key\"\n\nat one go. Claim 33 covers any antigen, including SIV ones, only if that is used to\n\nreproduce the process stated therein.202 I now come to the issue of sufficiency of disclosure. Disclosure\n\nunder Section 25 of the Patents Act does not entail minute, step by step directions. The\n\nperson skilled in the art is expected to display a reasonable degree of skill and common\n\nknowledge of the art and does not have to be told what is self-evident or part of common\n\ngeneral knowledge (Valensi v British Radio Corporation[1973] RPC 337;Mentor\n\nCorp. v Hollister Inc[1993] RPC 7). InBiogen Inc. v Medeva PLC[1997] RPC 1,\n\nthe House of Lords held that sufficiency of disclosure was to be determined as at the date\n\nof filing of the application. An insufficient application cannot therefore become\n\nsufficient because of general developments in the state of the art after that date.203 Claim 19 clearly covers a part of the entire sequence whatever the\n\nsize. Immuno-reactive epitopes could be selected by using the Patent in conjunction with\n\nsome or all of the information which was common general knowledge at the priority date,\n\nnamely that the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-2 was the best target antigen for detection\n\nefficiency, that the HIV-1 envelope transmembrane protein p41 was useful in finding\n\nantigens, that an 82 amino acid peptide from gp41 of HIV-1 could successfully detect 99%\n\nof HIV-1 infected patients and the use of the Pepscan method.204 Within some five months after the Claim 19 sequence was published\n\nafter the priority date by Guyader, one of the inventors of the Patent, Gnann was able to\n\nidentify the 12 mer.205 Where Claim 33 is concerned, a process to detect HIV-2 antibodies\n\nrequires only one immuno-reactive antigen. It was not necessary for every reactive antigen\n\nto be included. The Patent also discloses that the envelope glycoprotein gp140 of HIV-2 is\n\na suitable antigen for use in detecting HIV-2 antibodies.206 The Defendants’ attempts to impugn the validity of the\n\nPatent’s Claims 19 and 33 must therefore fail. I also note that the Patent was\n\ngranted by the EPO after substantial examination to ensure that the application met the\n\nEuropean requirements for patentability which are essentially the same as those in our\n\nAct. The four prior art documents were examined by the EPO which did not consider them to\n\nbe prejudicial to the validity of the Patent. Although the EPO’s views and decision\n\nare not binding on this Court, it would be churlish of me if I were to disregard such\n\nimpartial expert opinions altogether. As far as Abbott Laboratories’ withdrawn\n\nopposition was concerned, in the absence of clearer evidence, I would not read too much\n\ninto it as withdrawal of claims or opposition could be based on commercial rather than\n\nlegal or technical considerations.",
        "Infringement of the Patent": "207 Section 66 of the Patents Act defines infringement in the following\n\nway:\"66. (1) Subject to the provisions of this Act, a person infringes\n\n  a patent for an invention if, but only if, while the patent is in force, he does any of\n\n  the following things in Singapore in relation to the invention without the consent of the\n\n  proprietor of the patent:(a) where the invention is a product, he makes, disposes of, offers to\n\n    dispose of, uses or imports the product or keeps it whether for disposal or otherwise;(b) where the invention is a process, he uses the process or he offers\n\n    it for use in Singapore when he knows, or it is obvious to a reasonable person in the\n\n    circumstances, that its use without the consent of the proprietor would be an infringement\n\n    of the patent;(c) where the invention is a process, he disposes of, offers to dispose\n\n    of, uses or imports any product obtained directly by means of that process or keeps any\n\n    such product whether for disposal or otherwise.\"208 InCatnic Components Ltd v Hill & Smith Ltd[1982] RPC 183, the House of Lords sets out the following precepts in considering the question of\n\ninfringement by a variant:(1) A patent specification is to be treated as an unilateral statement\n\n  by the patentee, in words of his own choosing, addressed to persons skilled in the art, by\n\n  which he informs them what he claims to be the essential features of the new product or\n\n  process. These features constitute the \"pith and marrow\" of the claim.(2) A patent specification should be given a purposive construction\n\n  rather than a purely literal one.(3) The question in each case is: whether persons with practical\n\n  knowledge and experience of the kind of work in which the invention was intended to be\n\n  used, would understand that strict compliance with a particular descriptive word or phrase\n\n  appearing in a claim was intended by the patentee to be an essential requirement of the\n\n  invention so that any variant would fall outside the monopoly claimed, even though it\n\n  could have no material effect upon the way the invention works.209 InImprover Corporation v Remington Consumer Products Ltd[1990] FSR 181, Hoffmann J approached this issue by asking the following series of\n\nquestions:\"(1) Does the variant have a material effect on the way the\n\n  invention works?(2) Would it have been obvious to a man skilled in the art that a\n\n  variant would work in the same way?(3) Would the skilled reader nevertheless have understood that the\n\n  patentee intended to confine his claim to the primary meaning of (the product).\"210 The First Defendant’s case of non-infringement is essentially\n\nthat only 2% of the whole amino acid sequence in Claim 19 is found in the synthetic\n\npeptide in the 2.2 kit and that 20% of the synthetic peptide is not found in Claim 19. In\n\nrespect of the 1.2 kit, the First Defendant’s position amounts to nothing more than a\n\ngeneral denial of infringement. Even Professor Letvin was not aware of the 1.2 kit and was\n\ntestifying only in respect of the 2.2 kit.211 I accept Professor Cohen’s evidence that the test kits of the\n\nFirst Defendant infringe the relevant pleaded Claims of the Patent. The 18 mer is a highly\n\nimmuno-reactive portion of the amino acid sequence of Claim 19 and is therefore an\n\nessential part of the Patent. The other five amino acids in the First Defendant’s 23\n\nmer do not alter the character of the Plaintiffs’ 18 mer but only serve the function\n\nof being a fixing and stabilising agent for the all-important 18 mer on the nitrocellulose\n\nstrip.",
        "Laches and Acquiescence Defences": "212 Laches refers to the position that the delay in pursuing the remedy\n\nhas brought about and not to the delay itself. The Defendants must establish that there\n\nwas unreasonable delay in the commencement of proceedings and that, in all the\n\ncircumstances of the case, the consequences of such delay render the grant of relief to\n\nthe Plaintiffs unjust. Regard must be had to whether the Plaintiffs have gained an unjust\n\nadvantage or whether there is any change in the Defendants’ position to their\n\ndetriment which has resulted from the delay in commencing action (Spry, The Principles\n\nof Equitable Remedies 4thEdition, 1990).213 The starting point in computing the length of delay is the point in\n\ntime when the Plaintiffs came to know of the relevant facts giving rise to the cause of\n\naction.214 To establish the defence of acquiescence, two conditions must be\n\nmet:(1) an express or implied representation by the Plaintiffs that they do\n\n  not intend to enforce their rights or an assent or lying by on their part; and(2) in consequence of the above, it is unjust to grant the relief\n\n  sought. (seeSpry, supra).215 InSyed Ali Redha Alsagoff v Syed Salim Alhadad[1996] 3 SLR 410, Warren Khoo J said:\"The twin essential requirements for a case of acquiescence in the\n\n  circumstances of this case are knowledge, actual or constructive, of the wrongful acts of\n\n  the defendants in relation to the plaintiff’s property and a conscious omission to\n\n  stop them or prevent them from taking place or a knowing condonation of them.\"216 Can the defences of laches and of acquiescence apply to deny relief\n\nto the Plaintiffs here? In the same case cited above, Warren Khoo J said:\"Laches is essentially an equitable defence in answer to a claim\n\n  in equity. Here, the claim by the plaintiff as the administrator de bonis non is a claim\n\n  to assert rights at law of the estate over the property. It seems to me that the defence\n\n  of laches has no place in this context. It seems to me that this is a case where the maxim\n\n  equity follows the law aptly applies.\"217 The above views found favour with the Court of Appeal on appeal inScan\n\nElectronics (S) Pte Ltd v Syed Ali Redha Alsagoff[1997] 2 SLR 13. At paragraph 19 of\n\nthe judgment, the Court of Appeal said this in relation to the arguments on laches and\n\nacquiescence:\"The learned judge dealt with this question at pp 422 and 423 of\n\n  the report of his judgment. We entirely agree with what he said.\"However, at paragraph 20 of the judgment, the Court of Appeal appears\n\nnot to have endorsed what Warren Khoo J said about laches. The Court of Appeal stated:\"Thus, unreasonable delay or negligence in pursuing a right or\n\n  claim, particularly an equitable one, may be held to disentitle the plaintiff to\n\n  relief.\"The Court of Appeal went on to agree with the learned trial\n\njudge’s views that there was no factual foundation for laches or acquiescence to\n\nstand on in any case.218 The Plaintiffs say that the defence of laches is not applicable\n\nwhere a statutory limitation period has been prescribed. However, Section 32 of the\n\nLimitation Act and the decision inBritish and Malayan Trustees Ltd v Sindo Realty Pte\n\nLtd[1998] 2 SLR 495go against such a contention. Lai Siu Chiu J in that case held\n\nthat such an argument was clearly misconceived because of the said Section 32 which\n\nprovides:\"Nothing in this Act shall affect any equitable jurisdiction to\n\n  refuse relief on the ground of acquiescence, laches or otherwise.\"219 The Plaintiffs seek to distinguishBritish and Malayan Trustees\n\nLtdon the ground that the Court was dealing with the grant of specific performance of\n\na contract which is an equitable remedy. They argue that Section 32 Limitation Act and the\n\nabove case concern equitable rights.220 If the Plaintiffs are right, their claim for a declaration and an\n\ninjunction (equitable remedies) in respect of infringement of their Patent (rights at law)\n\nwould conceivably also come within the ambit of the said Section 32 although such remedies\n\nare provided for in Section 67(1) of the Patents Act. As shown above, the Court of Appeal\n\ninSyed Ali Redha Alsagoffdid not appear to have held that equitable remedies are\n\nprecluded in actions to enforce rights at law. On my part, I will deal with the equitable\n\ndefences here on the basis that they can apply to a case such as this.221 I accept the Plaintiffs’ evidence that they did not know of\n\nthe infringing activities of the First Defendant until sometime in 1996 and had proceeded\n\nwith reasonable despatch thereafter. There is no duty on the part of proprietors of\n\npatents to scan and survey the market constantly and vigilantly for infringers and to\n\npounce on them immediately when they are sighted. The Plaintiffs did not nip the First\n\nDefendant in the bud not because they did not care but because they did not notice this\n\nwild flower blossoming in the far reaches of their world garden. The Plaintiffs had made\n\ntheir position abundantly clear to the First Defendant in late 1993 and in 1994. It was\n\nthe considered decision of the First Defendant to carry on with the manufacture and\n\ncommercialization of the test kits after negotiations had come to a halt, abrupt though it\n\nmight have been. The Plaintiffs had never turned a blind eye to the activities of the\n\nFirst Defendant. When they met up with the First Defendant or its affiliated companies in\n\nthe USA after negotiations had been called off, it was to discuss their other business\n\narrangements and not to check on the First Defendant. In the context of the existing\n\ncordial relationship, the Plaintiffs surely could not be expected to enquire whether the\n\nFirst Defendant was infringing the Patent while they were visiting. The First Defendant\n\nhad also never intimated to the Plaintiffs that it was going ahead with its test kits\n\ndespite the lack of a licence. I therefore fail to see how the First Defendant was misled\n\nor lulled into continuing with their production and sale of the infringing test kits or\n\nwhy equity should intervene on the side of the First Defendant in any way.",
        "The Second Defendant": "222 Innocent infringement is no defence to a claim for infringement of\n\na Patent save for the question of whether damages are to be awarded. It is patently clear\n\nthat the Second Defendant was the conduit between the First Defendant in Singapore and\n\nNagase (Malaysia) in Kuala Lumpur. Some documents pertaining to the trap-purchase had the\n\nletterhead of the Second Defendant. It issued the tax invoice and the delivery order in\n\nSingapore. The delivery order shows that the test kits were transported from Singapore to\n\nMalaysia. The Second Defendant had therefore, in Singapore, disposed of or offered to\n\ndispose of or, at the very least, had kept the infringing kits for disposal or otherwise\n\nwithin the meaning of Section 66(1)(a) of the Patents Act. Disposal in this context would\n\ninclude sale but the word has wider meaning in the section. The Second Defendant need not\n\nhave disposed of the kits to the ultimate buyer. It is sufficient if it is the conduit.223 The Second Defendant relies onKalman v PCL Packaging (UK) Ltd[1982] FSR 406for the proposition that the offer to dispose must be one made in Singapore\n\nto dispose of the infringing product in Singapore. Since the quotation clearly states that\n\nthe test kits would be supplied within Malaysia only and the sale did take place in\n\nMalaysia, the Second Defendant argues there was no infringement.224 InKalman’s case, it was argued that the carriers had\n\ninfringed by warehousing (keeping for disposal) or carrying the goods into the United\n\nKingdom. This argument was rejected by Falconer J who was not persuaded that what British\n\nAirways had done in relation to the goods in carrying or warehousing and delivering them\n\nconstituted an infringing disposal. The Second Defendant argues that its case is even\n\nstronger as the kits were allegedly carried out of rather than into the jurisdiction.225 In my view, a proper reading of Section 66 does not support the\n\ncontention that the offer to dispose must be made in Singapore to dispose of the product\n\nin Singapore. The words in Section 66(1) – \"he does any of the following things\n\nin Singapore …\" – must be interpreted to read \"In Singapore, he makes,\n\ndisposes of, offers to dispose of …\". I do not think it is correct to juxtapose\n\nanother \"in Singapore\" at the end of each verb. Further, it would make little\n\nsense where the other verbs are concerned to say \"in Singapore, he uses or imports\n\nthe product in Singapore\". The only place in Section 66 where there is a repeat of\n\n\"in Singapore\" is in Section 66(1)(b) and that is inapplicable to our case here.226 It is also plain that the Second Defendant here is not a mere\n\nwarehouseman or carrier unlikeKalman’s case. It was obviously intimately\n\ninvolved in the transaction between the private investigator and Nagase (Malaysia).227 Although the Second Defendant has infringed the Patent, I accept\n\nthat it was not aware and had no reasonable grounds for supposing that the Patent existed.\n\nPursuant to Section 69(1) of the Patents Act, no damages shall be awarded nor an account\n\nof profits ordered against the Second Defendant.",
        "Section 75 Patents Act": "228 One final point emerges in the Closing Submissions of the\n\nDefendants. They rely on Section 75 Patents Act and submit that the Second Plaintiff\n\ncannot recover damages or obtain an account of profits because of its failure to register\n\nthe Collaboration Agreement it had with the First Plaintiff. Section 75 states:\"75. Where by virtue of a transaction, instrument or event to\n\n  which section 43 applies a person becomes the proprietor or one of the proprietors or an\n\n  exclusive licensee of a patent and the patent is subsequently infringed, the court or the\n\n  Registrar shall not award him damages or order that he be given an account of the profits\n\n  in respect of such a subsequent infringement occurring before the transaction, instrument\n\n  or event is registered unless –(a) the transaction, instrument or event is registered within the\n\n    period of 6 months beginning with its date; or(b) the court or the Registrar is satisfied that it was not practicable\n\n    to register the transaction, instrument or event before the end of that period and that it\n\n    was registered as soon as practicable thereafter.\"Section 43 applies to the assignment of a patent or application\n\ntherefor or a right therein and to the grant of a licence or sub-licence, among other\n\nthings.229 The Defendants argue as follows. The Patent was granted on 2\n\nNovember 1989. The Collaboration Agreement was signed on 26 March 1981 and renewed on 11\n\nJuly 1990. The Patents Act came into operation later on 23 February 1995 but applies by\n\nvirtue of the transitional provision in Section 116(3). One of the obligations is for a\n\nproprietor or an exclusive licensee to register the relevant document. Assuming that the\n\nPatents Act does not apply and the repealed Registration of United Kingdom Patents Act is\n\napplicable, Section 11 of the repealed Act required registration as well, the failure to\n\ndo which rendered the document inadmissible in any Court as evidence of the title to the\n\nrights and privileges. The Second Plaintiff registered the Collaboration Agreement only on\n\n1 June 1999, shortly before the trial commenced. No explanation has been offered as to why\n\nit was not done earlier. The fact of registration indicates the Second Plaintiff’s\n\nacknowledgement of the need to do so. The Defendants therefore submit that the Second\n\nPlaintiff is not entitled to damages or an account of profits.230 The short and simple answer is that no explanation was given as\n\nnone was asked for. This issue about Section 75 was not pleaded or alluded to in any way\n\nthroughout the trial. The rules of procedure dictate that the Defendants should not be\n\nallowed to raise this issue now but, as submissions have been made on it, I shall deal\n\nwith it nevertheless.231 If the repealed Act applies, the Second Plaintiff has complied\n\nbefore the trial and was entitled to admit the Collaboration Agreement. Section 75 of the\n\npresent Act could not have been intended to apply to past transactions such as the\n\ndocument in question here.

        "The Orders": "232 I therefore gave judgment for both Plaintiffs against the\n\nDefendants except that no damages or account of profits would be ordered against the\n\nSecond Defendant by virtue of Section 69(1). The Counterclaim was accordingly dismissed.\n\nThe First Defendant was ordered to pay full costs to both Plaintiffs in respect of the\n\nClaim and the Counterclaim while the Second Defendant was ordered to pay 90% of the costs\n\nfor the same as it had succeeded on the Section 69 issue. However, there would be only one\n\nset of costs in respect of the entire proceedings. I also ordered that costs of the\n\nassessment of damages be reserved to the Registrar concerned.",
        "The Defendants’ Stay Application": "233 On 18 February 2000, pursuant to the Defendants’ application,\n\nI ordered that the assessment of damages be stayed pending the appeal to the Court of\n\nAppeal but that taxation and payment of the costs of the trial should proceed. The\n\ninjunction and the order for delivery up of the infringing test kits were also stayed\n\npending the Defendants’ appeal. The First Defendant was ordered to state on affidavit\n\nthe number of test kits sold in the six years preceding the date of the Writ of Summons as\n\nwell as the number of test kits ordered as at the date of the affirmation of the\n\naffidavit, which was to be filed and served within three weeks. The First Defendant was,\n\npursuant to its proposal, ordered to pay an interim fee of US$2.20 per unit test sold and\n\ndelivered. The costs of this application will abide by the decision of the Court of\n\nAppeal.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONER31 March 2000Copyright © Government of Singapore."
