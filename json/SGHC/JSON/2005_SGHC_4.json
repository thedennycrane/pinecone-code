        "Introduction": "1On 9 May 1994 at about 6.30am, Henry Adolphus Lassiter (“HAL”) was crossing \nthe junction of Stevens Road/Scotts Road from Draycott Drive when a motor \nvehicle driven by the defendant, To Keng Lam (alias Jeanette Toh) (“the \nDriver”), collided with him. As a result, HAL was killed. He was 48 years old \nthen. He left behind his widow, Ann Masters Lassiter (“AML”), who was also 48 \nyears old then and four daughters. On 5 May 1997, AML filed an action in \nthe High Court for her own benefit and the benefit of other dependants of HAL. \nConsent judgment was subsequently entered against the Driver on the basis of 45% \nliability, with 55% liability attributed to HAL. 2AML claimed the following: (a)Loss of \ninheritance; (b)Loss of \nsupport; (c)Professional fees for post-mortem estate planning; (d)Various \nother items as special damages; and (e)Damages \nfor loss of bereavement. 3The assessment of damages was heard before an assistant registrar (“AR”) between \n28 February to 28 June 2002. The claims for loss of inheritance and \nloss of support were restricted by AML to claims for AML alone,ieexcluding the daughters. On 29 June 2002, the AR delivered a written \njudgment. The AR decided as follows: (a)The claim \nfor loss of inheritance was dismissed; (b)The claim \nfor loss of support (which the AR referred to as a claim for loss of dependency) \nwas assessed at US$130,000 per annum x eight years = US$1,040,000; (c)The claim \nfor professional fees for post-mortem estate planning was dismissed; (d)Most of \nthe various items claimed as special damages were allowed; (e)The \ndamages for bereavement were allowed at $10,000. 4The AR also made an award on costs although counsel for both sides had asked him \nto defer his decision on costs for the time being. 5The Driver filed an appeal, being Registrar’s Appeal No 600066 of 2002, \nagainst the AR’s decision in respect of the loss of support and on costs. AML \nalso filed an appeal, being Registrar’s Appeal No 600067 of 2002 against \nthe AR’s decision in respect of the following: (a)Loss of \ninheritance; (b)Loss of \nsupport; (c)Professional fees for post-mortem estate planning; and (d)Damages \nwhich were not allowed. 6Both appeals were heard by me and I now set out my decision and reasons. I would \nalso mention that at the outset, Mr Michael Hwang SC, counsel for AML, \nsaid that there was no claim for dependency for the daughters under AML’s \nappeal.",
        "Loss of \ninheritance": "7As I mentioned, AML made a claim for loss of inheritance. She was the main \nbeneficiary under HAL’s will. HAL was an entrepreneur who, it was alleged, \npreferred to put most of the profits he made back into his businesses rather \nthan have a higher earned income. Mr Hwang used the term “loss of \ninheritance” and “loss of savings” interchangeably and Mr Quentin \nLoh SC, counsel for the Driver, proceeded along those lines as well. It \nseems to me that “loss of inheritance” is not necessarily the same as “loss of \nsavings” and I shall elaborate on this later. The claim for loss of inheritance \nwas the largest head of claim. It was also the most contentious both on the law \nand on the facts. I will deal with the law first.",
        "The \nlaw": "8Mr Loh submitted that the claim for loss of inheritance was part of a claim \nfor lost years by an estate and that the estate’s claim for lost years was \nabolished in Singapore in 1987. That was why AML made the claim for loss of \ninheritance under a dependency claim. Mr Loh also submitted that a claim \nfor loss of inheritance was not maintainable under a dependency \nclaim. 9Mr Hwang accepted that an estate’s claim for lost years was abolished in \nSingapore in 1987. However, he submitted that a claim for loss of inheritance \nwas maintainable under a dependency claim in any event. 10As HAL died \non 9 May 1994, the applicable legislation is the Civil Law Act \n(Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) and not the 1999 Revised Edition. The relevant \nsections are ss 7, 12 and 14, and I set out below the relevant provisions \nthereof: 7.—(1) Subject to this section, on \nthe death of any person, all causes of action subsisting against or vested in \nhim shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the benefit of his \nestate: Provided that this subsection shall not \napply to causes of action for defamation or seduction or for inducing one spouse \nto leave or remain apart from the other or to any claim for damages on the \nground of adultery. (2)Where a \ncause of action survives as aforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a \ndeceased person, the damages recoverable for the benefit of the estate of that \nperson – (a)shall not \ninclude – (i) any exemplary damages; and (ii) any damages for loss of income in \nrespect of any period after that person’s death; (b)… (c)where the death of that person \nhas been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the cause of action, \nshall be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to his estate \nconsequent on his death except that a sum in respect of funeral expenses may be \nincluded. (3)… (4)The rights conferred by this \nsection for the benefit of the estates of deceased persons shall be in addition \nto and not in derogation of any rights conferred on the dependants of deceased \npersons by section 12 and so much of this section as relates to causes of action \nagainst the estates of deceased persons shall apply in relation to causes of \naction under that section as applies in relation to other causes of action not \nexpressly excepted from the operation of subsection (1). (5)… 12.—(1) If death is caused by any \nwrongful act, neglect or default which is such as would (if death has not \nensued) have entitled the person injured to maintain an action and recover \ndamages in respect thereof, the person who would have been liable if death had \nnot ensued shall be liable to an action for damages, notwithstanding the death \nof the person injured. (2)Subject to section 13(2), \nevery such action shall be for the benefit of the dependants of the person \n(referred to in this section and in sections 13 and 14 as the deceased) \nwhose death has been so caused. … (8)In this section, “dependant” \nmeans – (a)the wife or husband of the \ndeceased; (b)any parent, grandparent or \ngreat-grandparent of the deceased; (c)any child, grandchild or \ngreat-grandchild of the deceased; (d)any person (not being a child \nof the deceased) who, in the case of any marriage to which the deceased was at \nany time a party, was treated by the deceased as a child of the family in \nrelation to that marriage; (e)any person who is, or is the \nissue of, a brother, sister, uncle or aunt of the deceased. 14.—(1) In every action brought \nunder section 12, the court may award such damages as are proportioned to \nthe losses resulting from the death to the dependants respectively except that \nin assessing the damages there shall not be taken into account – (a)any sum \npaid or payable on the death of the deceased under any contract of assurance or \ninsurance; (b)any sum payable as a result of \nthe death under the Central Provident Fund Act; or (c)any pension or gratuity which \nhas been or will or may be paid as a result of the death. (2)… (3)In an \naction brought under section 12 where there fall to be assessed damages payable \nto a widow in respect of the death of her husband, there shall not be taken into \naccount the remarriage of the widow or her prospect of remarriage. (4)If the \ndependants have incurred funeral expenses in respect of the deceased, damages \nmay be awarded in respect of those expenses. 11As can be \nseen, s 7(2)(a)(ii) excludes an estate’s claim for damages for loss of \nincome in respect of any period after the death of the victim. For completeness, \nI would add that s 8 abolished the right to damages for loss of expectation \nof life except for one qualification which is unnecessary for me to \nmention. 12It is \nnecessary to go into some detail of the history of the legislation and cases of \nfatal accidents. I will focus first on the English position as Singapore \nlegislation on fatal accidents has followed English legislation closely most of \nthe time. 13Under the \ncommon law, a personal action did not survive a person’s death. This was \nconsidered to be unsatisfactory with the industrial revolution and the use of \ntrains and later, motor vehicles. In England in 1846, Lord Campbell’s Act \n(the Fatal Accidents Act) was passed to allow claims to be made for the death of \nthe victim for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the victim. \nAlthough there was no reference to dependants, Lord Campbell’s Act was \nconsidered to be for the benefit of dependants and not the estate. Since then, \nthere have been various legislation affecting such claims, for example, the \nFatal Accidents Act 1864, the Fatal Accidents Act 1959 and the Fatal \nAccidents Act 1976. 14In the \nmeantime, the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 was passed in \nEngland. It provided that a cause of action survived a person’s death for the \nbenefit of his estate, subject to some exceptions which are immaterial for \npresent purposes. 15Prior to \n1978, where a person’s death was caused by the negligence of another person, the \nwrongdoer was liable to compensate the deceased’s estate for loss of expectation \nof life but not for loss of future earnings. Secondly, the wrongdoer was also \nliable to compensate the dependants of the deceased for their loss of support \nwhich was known as a dependency claim or a loss of dependency. This claim would \nbe derived from but was not equivalent to the deceased’s loss of future \nearnings. Thirdly, the wrongdoer was liable to compensate any person or the \ndeceased’s estate for any additional disbursements incurred on account of the \naccident. However, the law on this began to change in 1978. 16InPickett v British Rail Engineering Ltd[1979] 1 All ER 774 \n(“Pickett”), a healthy 53-year-old man could have worked all the way \nuntil the retirement age of 65. However, due to exposure to asbestos, his life \nexpectancy was cut short to just one year. He sued for the loss of expectation \nof his life and for the loss of future earnings for that one year. Liability was \nnot denied. The defendants only challenged the claim on the question of quantum. \nThe trial judge allowed the claim for loss of expectation of life but only \nawarded him damages for loss of earnings during the one-year period that he was \nexpected to survive. The plaintiff appealed. He died before the matter reached \nthe Court of Appeal. His widow took over the action as the administratrix of his \nestate. 17The Court \nof Appeal did not award any sum for loss of earnings beyond the actual survival \nperiod. The administratrix appealed to the House of Lords contending that a much \nlarger amount ought to have been awarded in respect of loss of future \nearnings. 18A majority \nof the House of Lords allowed her appeal. They allowed the claim for loss of \nearnings during the deceased’s lifetime rather than the shortened span of his \nlife. What weighed heavily on the minds of the Law Lords there was the fact that \nhad they not allowed the appeal, the widow would be left with no recourse or \nclaim for her loss of dependency. 19Lord Wilberforce said at 778: This creates a difficulty. It is assumed \nin the present case, and the assumption is supported by authority, that if an \naction for damages is brought by the victim during his lifetime, and either \nproceeds to judgment or is settled, further proceedings cannot be brought after \nhis death under the Fatal Accidents Acts. If this assumption is correct, it \nprovides a basis, in logic and justice, for allowing the victim to recover for \nearnings lost during his lost years. This assumption is based on the wording \nof s 1 of the 1846 Act (now s 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976) and \nis not supported by any decision of this House. It cannot however be challenged \nin this appeal, since there is before us no claim under the Fatal Accident Acts. \nI think, therefore, that we must for present purposes act on the basis that it \nis well founded, and that if the present claim, in respect of earnings during \nthe lost years, fails it will not be possible for a fresh action to be brought \nby the deceased’s dependants in relation to them. 20He \ncontinued at 781: My Lords, in the case of the adult wage \nearner with or without dependants who sues for damages during his lifetime, I am \nconvinced that a rule which enables the ‘lost years’ to be taken account of \ncomes closer to the ordinary man’s expectations than one which limits his \ninterest to his shortened span of life. The interest which such a man has in the \nearnings he might hope to make over a normal life, if not saleable in a market, \nhas a value which can be assessed. A man who receives that assessed value would \nsurely consider himself and be considered compensated; a man denied it would \nnot. And I do not think that to act in this way creates insoluble problems of \nassessment in other cases. In that of a young child (cfBenham v \nGambling) neither present nor future earnings could enter into the matter; \nin the more difficult case of adolescents just embarking on the process of \nearning (cfSkelton v Collins) the value of ‘lost’ earnings might be real \nbut would probably be assessable as small. There will remain some difficulties. In \ncases, probably the normal, where a man’s actual dependants coincide with those \nfor whom he provides out of the damages he receives, whatever they obtain by \ninheritance will simply be set off against their own claim. If on the other hand \nthis coincidence is lacking, there might be duplication of recovery. To that \nextent injustice may be caused to the wrongdoer. But if there is a choice \nbetween taking a view of the law which mitigates a clear and recognised \ninjustice in cases of normal occurrence, at the cost of the possibility in fewer \ncases of excess payments being made, or leaving the law as it is, I think that \nour duty is clear. We should carry the judicial process of seeking a just \nprinciple as far as we can, confident that a wise legislator will correct \nresultant anomalies. 21InPickett, the victim himself had commenced action and obtained judgment \nbefore he died. However, inGammell v Wilson[1981] 1 All ER 578 \n(“Gammell”), two claims for loss of future earnings were allowed in cases \nwhere the plaintiffs, in two separate actions, were the parents of two young men \nwho had been killed in accidents as a result of the negligence of the respective \ndefendants. The claims were made under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 in the first \ncase, and the Fatal Accidents Acts 1846 to 1959 in the second case, by the \nplaintiffs on behalf of themselves as dependants and on behalf of the estate of \nthe deceased under the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (the “1934 \nAct”). 22At the \nhearing of the appeals before the House of Lords, the defendants contended that \nunder the 1934 Act, a deceased’s estate was not entitled to recover damages for \nloss of future earnings because the cause of action for such earnings was a \n“gain to the estate” while the loss of earnings was a “loss to the estate”, and \nthat in accordance with s 1(2)(c) of the 1934 Act, damages under the 1934 \nAct were to be calculated without reference to any loss or gain to the estate \nconsequent on the victim’s death. The appeals were dismissed by a majority of \nthe House of Lords on the basis that the right to recover damages for loss of \nfuture earnings vested in the deceased immediately before his death, and not on \nhis death, and the right passed to his beneficiaries whether they were his \ndependants or not. Section 1(2)(c) of the 1934 Act isinpari \nmateriawith s 7(2)(c) of the Civil Law Act. Paragraph (1) of the \nheadnote of the report states,inter alia: Accordingly, even though it produced a \nresult which was neither sensible nor just, the House was constrained to hold \nthat the plaintiffs were entitled to the damages awarded for the lost years \ndespite the fact that those damages far exceeded the amount to which they were \nentitled under the 1976 Act as dependants. 23Lord Diplock said at 583: If the deceased [inPickett] had \ndied before judgment in his action had been entered his widow would have had her \ncause of action under the Fatal Accidents Acts. This would have enabled her to \nrecover the value of the provision that he would have made for her needs out of \nhis earnings during those 11 ‘lost years’. But because he died after the \njudgment his dependent widow was deprived of that cause of action, and the \ngeneral damages for pain and suffering recoverable on behalf of his estate, of \nwhich she was the sole beneficiary, fell considerably short of the sum that she \nwould have been likely to recover under the Fatal Accidents Acts as the amount \nof the dependency if that cause of action had remained open to her. Here was an obvious injustice which this \nHouse remedied by overrulingOliver v Ashmanand holding that a living \nplaintiff could recover damages for loss of earnings during the lost years, but \nthat in assessing the measure of such damages there should be deducted from the \ntotal earnings the amount that he would have spent out of those earnings on his \nown living expenses and pleasures since these would represent an expense that \nwould be saved in consequence of his death. In the case of a married man of \nmiddle age and of a settled pattern of life, which was the case of \nMr Pickett, the effect of this deduction is to leave a net figure which \nrepresents the amount which he would have spent on providing for his wife and \nany other dependants,together with any savingsthat he might have set \naside out of his income.If one ignores the savings element, which in most \ncases would be likely to be small, this net figure is substantially the same as \nthe damages that would have been recoverable by the widow under the Fatal \nAccidents Acts: it represents the dependency. So, in the particular case of \nMr Pickett’s widow the result was to do substantial justice. My Lords, if the only victims of fatal \naccidents were middle-aged married men in steady employment living their lives \naccording to a well-settled pattern that would have been unlikely to change if \nthey had lived on uninjured, the assessment of damages for loss of earnings \nduring the lost years may not involve what can only be matters of purest \nspeculation. But, as the instant appeals demonstrates and so do other unreported \ncases which have been drawn to the attention of this House, in cases where there \nis no such settled pattern (and this must be so in a high proportion of cases of \nfatal injuries) the judge is faced with a task that is so purely one of \nguesswork that it is not susceptible of solution by the judicial process. \nGuesses by different judges are likely to differ widely, yet no one can say that \none is right and another wrong. Where Parliament has intervened by \npassing the Fatal Accidents Acts, the law relating to damages for death \nrecoverable by dependants is sensible and just with the possible exception of \nthe case of widows who have remarried or become engaged to do so by the time the \naction is heard. I join with your Lordships in thinking that it is too late for \nanything short of legislation to bring the like sense and justice to the law \nrelating to damages for death recoverable by the estate of the \ndeceased. [emphasis added] 24Lord Fraser of Tullybelton said at 588: It is, no doubt, just and sensible that, \nwhere the death of the family breadwinner is caused by the negligence of some \nother person, that person should be liable to compensate the deceased’s \ndependants for the injury which they have suffered from the death. The main \nelement of injurywill normally be loss of support. Such compensation is \nprovided for by the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. But it seems to me difficult \nto justify a law whereby the deceased’s estate, which may pass to persons or \ninstitutions in no way dependent on him for support, can recover damages for \nloss of earnings, or other income, which he would probably have received during \nthe ‘lost years’. [emphasis added] 25I have \ncited the above judgments not only to emphasise the point about the injustice of \ndouble recovery but because the judgments indicated that in England, loss of \nsavings is not part of a dependency claim. I will come back to this point \nagain. 26After the \ndecision inGammell, the UK Parliament passed the Administration of \nJustice Act 1982 (“the 1982 Act”) which took away the cause of action by the \nestate of a deceased person for loss of income in the lost years. Section 4 \nof the 1982 Act amended s 2(a) of the 1934 Act. Section 4(2) of the \n1982 Act states: The following paragraph shall be \nsubstituted for subsection 2(a) – (a)shall not \ninclude – (i)any \nexemplary damages; (ii)any \ndamages for loss of income in respect of any period after that person’s \ndeath [emphasis added] 27Gammellwas followed reluctantly by the Singapore Court of Appeal inLow Kok Tong v Teo Chan Pan[1982–1983] SLR 346 (“Low Kok \nTong”) where the claim was made under s 8 of the Civil Law Act \n(Cap 30, 1970 Rev Ed) before the amendments in 1987. Lai Kew \nChai J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at 350, \n[14]-[15]: We have, however, considered it necessary \nto state at the end of this judgment that the effect of our decision, \nreluctantly arrived at, could give rise to some undesirable consequences. It \ncould be questioned with some justification why persons other than the actual \ndependants of a deceased should be unjustly enriched by an award to the estate \nfor the ‘lost years’. … … It is the province of our legislature \nto reform the law. 28Following \nthe amendments in England by the 1982 Act andLow Kok Tong, Singapore \nsimilarly amended its legislation in 1987 so that an estate of a deceased person \nwas disallowed from claiming damages for loss of income for the lost \nyears. 29In \nParliament, the then Second Minister for Law, Prof S Jayakumar, said \non 4 March 1987 (Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Reportvol 49 at cols 66–69): This Bill will make certain reforms to \nthe law relating to damages payable in cases of fatal accidents. This is \nnecessary because of a change in the law brought about by a judicial decision in \nthe United Kingdom House of Lords in 1981. Similar amendments have been made to \nthe laws of other countries such as the United Kingdom and Hong Kong. Before 1981, when a person died in a \nfatal accident caused by the negligent act of another person, the wrongdoer was \nliable to compensate – First, the deceased’s estate for the \ndeceased’s loss of expectation of life; Secondly, to compensate the dependants of \nthe deceased for the loss sustained by them on account of his death, what is \nknown as “loss of dependency” claim; and Thirdly, any additional disbursements \nincurred by any person or the deceased’s estate on account of the \naccident. The income which the deceased would have \nearned had he not died was not a part of the damages payable by the wrongdoer. \nIn other words, damages for what is known in the legal jargon as the “lost \nyears” could not be claimed by the deceased’s estate. However, the law on this was changed in \n1981 when the United Kingdom House of Lords decided the case known asGammell \nv Wilson. The House of Lords in that case decided that damages for the “lost \nyears” could be claimed by the estate of a person killed in a fatal \naccident. That case was followed by our Court of \nAppeal in 1982 because it was based on the interpretation of a United Kingdom \nstatutory provision which is similar in all respects to section 8(2) of our \nCivil Law Act. Certain undesirable consequences may \narise from this changed state of the law: First, double compensation may be payable \nin cases where the deceased’s dependants are not also beneficiaries of the \ndeceased’s estate. The wrongdoer may have to pay damages to both the deceased’s \nestate for “lost years” and to his dependants for their “loss of dependency”, a \nresult which surely cannot be acceptable. Secondly, where the deceased has no \ndependants, other persons, eg, distant relatives, may receive a “windfall” and \nbe unjustly enriched by such an award. Thirdly, the estate claim for the “lost \nyears” is often higher than the “loss of dependency” claim. In some cases, \ndependants may obtain damages which are more than their actual loss of \ndependency. Such cases include cases where the dependants are already elderly \nand are likely to have died before the deceased person had he not met with a \npremature death in an accident. Sir, the need to reform this \nunsatisfactory state of the law was recognized by the House of Lords in the case \nof Gammell itself. Nearly all the judges in Gammell’s case called for \nlegislative intervention. So too in our own Court of Appeal, quote \nMr Justice Lai who called for reform, “It is in the province of our \nlegislature to reform the law.” … The third amendment, as mentioned, Sir, \nthe dependants of the deceased person can always claim for loss of dependency. \nHowever, at present the law recognizes only a few categories of persons as \ndependants for this purpose. Only the spouse, parent, grandparent, child, \nstepchild and grandchild of the deceased are eligible to claim for loss of \ndependency. Under our existing law, other relatives who are actually dependent \non the deceased but who do not fall within these narrow categories cannot claim \nfor loss of dependency, eg brothers and sisters, nephews and nieces. In order to \nprevent undue hardship or injustice, the Bill seeks to extend the categories of \ndependants to also include – (a)brother, \nsister, uncle, aunt, nephew, niece and first cousin of the deceased. (b)child \ntreated by the deceased and his wife as a child of their family; (c)great-grandchildren or great-grandparent of the deceased. I need to add, Sir, that to succeed in \nany such claim for dependency a person must not only fall within the categories \nof dependency which we have now enlarged, but must also be able to prove to the \ncourt that he was actually financially dependent on the deceased \nperson. 30Mr Hwang submitted that allowing AML to claim for loss of inheritance under \na dependency claim would not cause any of the three undesirable consequences \nmentioned by Prof Jayakumar. Firstly, there would be no double \ncompensation. Secondly, there would be no unjust enrichment as a person like AML \nwould have to qualify as a dependant first. Thirdly, since the estate claim for \nlost years was abolished, there was no question of aged dependants getting more \nthan their actual dependency. They would not be entitled to claim for loss of \nsavings even on a dependency claim as they would in the ordinary course of \nevents have passed away before the deceased. 31While it is \ntrue that a dependant’s claim for loss of inheritance was not one of the stated \nconsequences to be avoided, this does not necessarily mean that such a claim \nshould be allowed. I still have to consider what the law in Singapore before the \n1987 amendments was. Accordingly, when Mr Hwang citedHo Yeow Kim v Lai \nHai Kuen[1999] 2 SLR 246for the proposition that the 1987 \namendments did not alter the law on dependency claims, I had no difficulty \naccepting that proposition. However, that proposition still did not answer the \nquestion whether a claim for loss of inheritance was maintainable in a \ndependency claim in Singapore. 32Mr Hwang submitted numerous authorities for the proposition that both in \nEngland and in Singapore, a dependant could claim for loss of inheritance. \nIndeed, Mr Hwang submitted that so long as a claimant came within the \ndefinition of a dependant and had a reasonable expectation of benefit from the \ndeceased, then it would not matter whether the expectation wasquadependant orquaestate. He argued that the process of succession, \nwhether on intestacy or otherwise, was merely the mechanics of transmitting the \nmoney to a dependant. 33Mr Hwang relied onFranklin v The South Eastern Railway Company(1858) 3 H&N 211 at 213–214; 157 ER 448 at 449 where \nPollock CB said: The statute does not in terms say on what \nprinciple the action it gives is to be maintainable, nor on what principle the \ndamages are to be assessed; and the only way to ascertain what it does, is to \nshew what it does not, mean. Now it is clear that damage must be shewn, for the \njury are to “give such damages as they think proportioned to the injury.” It has \nbeen held that these damages are not to be given as a solatium; but are to be \ngiven in reference to a pecuniary loss. … It is also clear that the damages are \nnot to be given merely in reference to the loss of a legal right, for they are \nto be distributed among relations only, and not to all individuals sustaining \nsuch a loss; and accordingly the practice has not been to ascertain what benefit \ncould have been enforced by the claimants, had the deceased lived, and give \ndamages limited thereby. If then the damages are not to be calculated on either \nof these principles, nothing remains except they should be calculated in \nreference to a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit, as of right or \notherwise, from the continuance of the life. 34InDalton v The South-Eastern Railway Company(1858) 4 CB (NS) 296 \nat 305; 140 ER 1098 at 1102, Willes J said that “legal liability \nalone is not the test of injury in respect of which damages may be recovered \nunder Lord Campbell’s Act … but … the reasonable expectation of pecuniary \nadvantage by the relation remaining alive may be taken into account by the \njury”. 35Although \nthe judgments in these two cases appeared wide enough to include a claim for \nloss of savings by a dependant, they did not actually deal with such a \nclaim. 36InPym v \nThe Great Northern Railway Company(1862) 2 B&S 759; 121 ER \n1254, an action was brought by a plaintiff as widow and administratrix of a \ngentleman of fortune on behalf of herself and eight children to recover \ncompensation under Lord Campbell’s Act. She claimed,inter alia, the \nsavings which the deceased would have set aside for the benefit of his wife and \nchildren. Cockburn CJ was of the view that such a claim was sustainable in \nprinciple although he was aware of the serious consequences which would ensue in \nthe event of a fatal accident happening from negligence to an individual of a \nvery large fortune. However, he thought that that was a matter for the \nLegislature,ieas to whether any limit should be put on the liability. \nAlthough this decision showed that savings may be taken into account in a \ndependency claim, it should be borne in mind that at that time there was no \nlegislation to allow a claim by the estate. 37The test of \na reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit was reiterated inTaff Vale \nRailway Company v Jenkins[1913] AC 1 but this case did not \nexpressly deal with the question of savings. 38Nance v \nBritish Columbia Electric Railway Company Ld[1951] AC 601 \n(“Nance”) was an appeal from the Court of Appeal of British Columbia to \nthe Privy Council. The issue there was whether there was contributory negligence \non the part of the deceased and whether there was a misdirection by the trial \njudge to the jury. However, the Privy Council also dealt with the quantum of \ndamages. On the quantum of damages, Viscount Simon said at 614: The second question is, what principles \nthe court of first instance should itself apply in determining the quantum of \ndamages under the relevant British Columbian legislation, which reproduces with \ninconspicuous differences the Fatal Accidents Acts in force in the United \nKingdom. … The claim to damages in the present case \nfalls under two separate heads. First, if the deceased had not been killed, but \nhad eked out the full span of life to which in the absence of the accident he \ncould reasonably have looked forward, what sums during that period would he \nprobably have applied out of his income to the maintenance of his wife and \nfamily? … Secondly, in addition to any sum arrived at under the first head, the \ncase has been arguedon the assumption, common to both parties, that \naccording to the law of British Columbia it would be proper to award a sum \nrepresenting such portion of any additional savingswhich he would or might \nhave accumulated during the period for which, but for his accident, he would \nhave lived, as on his death at the end of this period would probably have \naccrued to his wife and family by devolution either on his intestacy or under \nhis will, if he made a will. [emphasis added] 39As \nMr Loh stressed, there was no issue inNancethat savings were \nclaimable in a dependency claim. This is important becauseNanceis cited \nin subsequent cases and textbooks as authority for the proposition that a claim \nfor loss of savings is maintainable in a dependency claim. 40InMallet v McMonagle[1970] AC 166 (“Mallet”), a claim \nwas made under the Fatal Accidents Act. Lord Diplock said at \n174–175: To assess the damages it is necessary to \nform a view upon three matters each of which is in greater or less degree one of \nspeculation: (1) the value of the material benefits for his dependants \nwhich the deceased would have provided out of his earnings for each year in the \nfuture during which he would have provided them, had he not been killed; \n(2) the value of any material benefits which the dependants will be able to \nobtain in each such year from sources (other than insurance) which would not \nhave been available to them had the deceased lived but which will become \navailable to them as a result of his death; (3) the amount of the capital \nsum which with prudent management will produce annual amounts equal to the \ndifference between (1) and (2) (that is “the dependency”) for each of the years \nduring which the deceased would have provided material benefits for the \ndependants, had he not been killed. 41As can be \nseen, there was no express mention about savings inMallet. 42InTaylor v O’Connor[1971] AC 115 (“Taylor”), the House \nof Lords, in assessing damages for a dependency claim under the Fatal Accidents \nActs, took into account the savings which the deceased would have made provision \nfor but for his death. Lord Reid said at 127–128: The general principle is not in doubt. \nThey are entitled to such a sum as will make good to them the financial loss \nwhich they have suffered and will suffer as a result of the death. But future \nloss is necessarily conjectural. If all had gone well, the husband would have \nearned very large sums for a long period so that he could have maintained them \nat least at their standard of living at the time of his death and made other \nprovision for their future. … It had been assumed that the wife’s \ndependency ought to be calculated on the footing that it would have ceased when \nthe husband ceased earning. I do not think that is right in this case. Before he \nreached 65 he would have been able to make ample provision for the future, \nwhether or not he survived, and I think that, if one is to be realistic, \ndependency should be taken on the basis that she would be maintained at the same \nrate of expenditure throughout her life. We were informed that her expectation \nof life was about 21 years. I regard this as the main element in the \nrespondent’s claim, and I think that any discount for contingencies should be \ncomparatively small. She or the daughter would also have an interest in any \ncapital which the deceased might have accumulated before his death. … But take the present case. The respondent \nwill have the £10,000 [being the amount saved so far] to which I have referred \nand damages in respect of (a) loss of her dependency and (b) loss of \nher interest in the savings which the husband would have made. 43Lord Pearson said at 141–142: The lost benefit.The next step was to estimate the pecuniary benefit which the \ndependants, the respondent and the daughter, probably would have derived from \nthe earnings of the deceased over the 15-year or 18-year period if the earnings \nhad not been lost. … The judge estimated that of the \ndeceased’s net spendable income, estimated at £6,000 per annum, two-thirds, that \nis, £4,000 per annum, would have enured to the benefit of the respondent and the \ndaughter. That must include both elements of the lost pecuniary benefit, namely, \nthe maintenance element and the savings element. Presumably the deceased would \nin the later years of his working life have been both maintaining the family and \nsaving for the benefit of the family. The savings would have provided some \npresent financial security not only for the deceased but also for the respondent \nand the daughter, and probably the savings or the residue of them would \nultimately have been inherited by the respondent and the daughter or one of \nthem. I think the £4,000 per annum was a moderate estimate of the lost \nbenefit. 44Although \nthis case appeared to be authority for the proposition that future savings \nshould be taken into account in a dependency claim, it seems to me that the \npoint was not in issue there. While Lord Reid appeared to treat the loss of \nsavings as a separate head of claim to loss of dependency, the judgments of the \nlaw lords do not indicate any argument that loss of savings should rightfully be \na claim by the estate. Lord Reid also did not think that the dependency \nought to be calculated on the footing that it would have ceased when the husband \nceased earning. While it may be true that a wife’s dependency does not actually \nstop when her husband stops earning, the fact is that, in Singapore, a wife’s \ndependency claim is calculated with reference to when the husband would stop \nearning had he not been killed in the accident. 45Although I \nhave not cited from the judgment of Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest inTaylor, I note that he referred to Viscount Simon’s judgment inNanceas regards the additional amount the husband inTaylorwould \nprobably have saved. However, as I have stressed,Nancehad assumed that \nfuture savings are claimable in a dependency claim. It seems to me thatTaylorwas no more an authority to support AML’s claim for loss of \ninheritance than my decision inTan Harry v Teo Chee Yeow Aloysius[2004] 1 SLR 513(“Tan Harry”) was such an authority. I will \ncome back toTan Harrylater. 46Mr Loh \nsubmitted thatTaylorhas not been subsequently cited as authority for \nthe proposition that future savings are claimable as part of a dependency claim. \nI note that, for example, althoughTaylorwas referred to inCookson v \nKnowles[1979] AC 556 (“Cookson”), the House of Lords \nthere did not say that future savings were claimable in a dependency claim. InCookson, Lord Diplock said at 567 and 568: When the first Fatal Accidents Act was \npassed in 1846, its purpose was to put the dependants of the deceased, who had \nbeen the bread-winner of the family, in the same position financially as if he \nhad lived his natural span of life. In times of steady money values, wages \nlevels and interest rates this could be achieved in the case of the ordinary \nworking man by awarding to his dependants the capital sum required to purchase \nan annuity of an amount equal to the annual value of the benefits with which he \nhad provided them while he lived, and for such period as it could reasonably be \nestimated they would have continued to enjoy them but for his premature death. \nAlthough this does not represent the way in which it is calculated such a \ncapital sum may be expressed as the product of multiplying an annual sum which \nrepresents the “dependency” by a number of years’ purchase. This latter figure \nis less than the number of years which represents the period for which it is \nestimated that the dependants would have continued to enjoy the benefit of the \ndependency, since the capital sum will not be exhausted until the end of that \nperiod and in the meantime so much of it as is not yet exhausted in each year \nwill earn interest from which the dependency for that year could in part be \nmet. 47At 571, \nLord Diplock also said: Quite apart from the prospects of future \ninflation, the assessment of damages in fatal accidents can at best be only \nrough and ready because of the conjectural nature of so many of the other \nassumptions upon which it has to be based. The conventional method of \ncalculating it has been to apply to what is found upon the evidence to be a sum \nrepresenting “the dependency,” a multiplier representing what the judge \nconsiders in the circumstances particular to the deceased to be the appropriate \nnumber of years’ purchase. 48AlthoughCooksondid not expressly say that savings were to be excluded in a \ndependency claim, the subsequent case ofGammelldid say this. I refer \nagain to the judgments of Lord Diplock and Lord Fraser ofTullybeltonwhich I have cited at [23] and [24] above. 49I come now \nto the interesting case ofCape Distribution Ltd v O’Loughlin[2001] EWCA Civ 178 (“O’Loughlin”). The judgment \nof Latham LJ sets out the facts in some detail as well as the reasons for \nhis decision. He said: 1.On \nthe 13th May 1995 Mr O’Loughlin died. He was 50 years of age, having been \nborn on the 17th September 1944. His death was due to mesothelioma contracted as \na result of exposure to asbestos dust while working for the appellants at their \nfactory in Uxbridge for four months in 1966. On the 2nd July 1999, Forbes J \nawarded his widow, the respondent, a total of £284,652.38 inclusive of interest \nin respect of the claims which she had made arising out of her husbands \n[sic] death on her own behalf, and on behalf of the two teenage sons of \nthe marriage, under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976, and of his estate under the \nLaw Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934. Of this award, £164,035.95 \nrepresented the loss of past and future financial dependency under the Fatal \nAccidents Act, and interest. In this appeal, the appellants challenge the \njudge’s findings upon which he based this part of his award. 2.This \nappeal raises once again the difficult question of how to assess the value in \nmonies worth of the loss of a husband and father when the family’s financial \naffairs are not straight forward. Mr O’Loughlin had, together with a \npartner, run a successful plant hire business in Ireland for some years. The \nrespondent’s claim was, however, based upon Mr O’Loughlin’s business \nactivities in and after 1989, when he severed his relationship with his partner. \nAlthough to begin with, these activities were based on plant hire, through the \nmedium of two companies, Ready Hire Ltd and Green Hire Ltd, they gradually \nconcentrated on property development, so that by 1994, the year before his \ndeath, property formed the sole basis of the family’s finances. … 3.When \nhe started property dealing in 1989, the family owned three properties, \nincluding the matrimonial home which was subject to a mortgage. Excluding these \nproperties, he had, by the time of his death built a property portfolio of some \nseven investment properties worth approximately £750,000, three of which were \nsubject to commercial mortgage of approximately £120,000. These properties were \nheld in the name of Mr O’Loughlin and the respondent, or Ready Hire Ltd. He \nalso had a 50% share in two companies together with Mr Howley, which owned \ntwo other properties. He was obviously successful; and by the time of his death \nhe had repaid the mortgage on the family home. Mr O’Loughlin’s income tax \nreturns disclosed substantial income receipts. His gross income was £92,527 for \nthe year ending 1992, £49,097 for 1993, £51,828 for 1994, and £59,283 for 1995. \nThese figures are to a great extent artificial, in significant part constructed \nso as to take as much fiscal advantage as possible of the period leading up to \nhis death. The rental receipts which underpinned his and the company’s annual \nearnings were approximately £32,000. After his death, the respondent did not \nsuffer any immediate financial disadvantage. She received the full value of all \nMr O’Loughlin’s capital assets. Although before his death she would help in \na secretarial capacity, she never involved herself in the management or \ndevelopment of the properties. After his death, she attempted to do so, but \nfound that she did not have the necessary skills. In order to maintain her life \nstyle, she has sold three of the properties and enjoys the investment income \nfrom these as well as the rental from the remainder. She has not been able to \ncarry on the property development side of the business. … 4.On \nbehalf of the respondent, it was submitted to the judge that the court had to \napproach the assessment of damages on the basis set out by Staughton LJ inWood-v-Bentall Simplex Ltd[1992] PIQR 332at \n349: One then turns to the case where the \nincome is in part derived from labour and in part from capital. Suppose that the \nhusband owns a boarding house and that he and his wife run it together. If he \nshould happen to be killed by a negligent wrongdoer and his widow inherits the \nhouse and continues to run it, should she recover to the extent of her \ndependency on the whole of the profit of the boarding house? This is not very \ndifferent from the present case. My answer is that one must again determine what \nthe dependants have lost. No question of deduction arises. The court has to \nascertain how much loss has arisen because the deceased is no longer alive and \nable to work, and how much the deceased’s income is derived solely from capital \nwhich the dependants have inherited. 5.On \nthat basis it was contended that the loss to the dependants as a result of \nMr O’Loughlin’s death was his flair, experience and entrepreneurial skills \nto manage and develop the property portfolio and the financial benefits that \nthat would bring to the family. It was contended that he would have continued to \nhave done so until at least aged 60. As a result, it could have been anticipated \nthat he would have increased the portfolio and the rental income by acquisition \nand development which are clear benefits which the dependants have now lost. It \nwas submitted that the most secure way to assess the value of these services \nwould be to determine what it would cost to replace them. A Mr Potterton of \na firm of estate agents produced a report in which he assessed the cost of \nreplacing these services at £28,000 per annum. 6.For \nthe appellants, it was submitted that in truth, the dependants had lost little. \nThe full value of the capital assets remained available to them. They had the \nbenefit of the rental income and interest on investments from the whole of the \ncapital assets of Mr O’Loughlin. They submitted that it was wholly \ninappropriate to assess the dependency on the basis of a valuation of the loss \nof services. This, it was submitted, failed to take any account of the fact that \nthe evidence before the judge showed that for the period immediately after his \ndeath, the respondent, and therefore the family, had lost little. More \nfundamentally, it was submitted that no proper basis had been put before the \ncourt on behalf of the respondent to determine the true nature and extent of the \ndependency which could enable the court to come to a proper conclusion as to the \ntrue value of the dependency. … 11.The \nstarting point must be the terms of the relevant provision in the Fatal \nAccidents Act 1976. Section 3(1) provides: In the action such damages, other than \ndamages for bereavement, may be awarded as are proportioned to the injury \nresulting from the death to the dependants respectively. This provision replicates, though not in \nprecisely the same words, the basis upon which damages have been assessed since \nthe passing of the Fatal Accidents Act 1846. … 12.The first \nclear expression of this principle to which we have been referred is in the \njudgment of Erle CJ inPym v Great Northern Railway Company, which I \nhave already cited. However, inTaff Vale Railway v Jenkins[1913] \n1 AC 1 the courts first recognised that a claim could be made in respect \nof services rendered gratuitously by the deceased. … 13.This \nprinciple has been applied time and time again by the court in cases where the \nclaimant has lost the services of a wife or mother. It has also been applied to \nthe loss of a husband’s services as handiman [sic], gardener, or any \nother such service activity as has been lost and has a money value in the sense \nthat it will cost money to replace. I can see no difference in principle between \nthe loss of services of that domestic nature, and the loss of services which \nhave a positive financial value to the family. For example, a husband may be so \nskilled and successful in dealing with the family’s investments that he has no \nneed of a stockbroker or other financial adviser. His death, whatever other loss \nmay result, will mean that the family will have to replace that expertise and \nadvice at the appropriate market cost. That cost is as much a loss to the family \nas could be the cost of a gardener. And, clearly, the position cannot be \ndifferent, indeed it is a fortiori, if the family’s sole source of support is \nthe investment portfolio managed by such a husband. 15.In the \npresent case, the judge came to the clear conclusion that the dependants had \nlost the flair and business acumen which would, by clear inference have resulted \nin a successful development of the property portfolio which represented the \nfamily’s assets, with consequential increases in both the capital and the income \nvalue of that portfolio. In my view the judge was clearly correct in concluding \nthat the dependants had thereby suffered a loss capable of being measured in \nmoney terms. He could, as submitted by Mr Alliott, have been asked to \nembark upon a complex evaluation of the extent to which the portfolio managed by \nMr O’Loughlin would have been more valuable than the assets managed by the \nrespondent. This would have involved a comparison of on the one hand, the likely \nincrease in income and capital to be expected from prudent investment by \nsomebody on the respondent’s behalf of these assets, for she herself on the \njudge’s findings, could not be expected to have managed them herself, and a \nprojection of the increase in income and capital values of the portfolio based \nupon an extrapolation from Mr O’Loughlin’s success between 1989 and 1995. \nIt seems to me that such an exercise, although theoretically possible, would be \nso riddled with uncertainty and speculation as to make it difficult for a judge \nto find a secure basis for any conclusions that he might seek to \nreach. 16.But one \nthing is certain, namely that the respondent would have to have professional \nadvice in order to manage the family assets properly and effectively. The cost \nof such advice therefore represents the most secure basis from which to attempt \nto place a pecuniary value on the loss to the dependants arising from \nMr O’Loughlin’s death. Whether she chooses to have such an advisor or not \nis another matter. But the fact will always remain that she and the dependants \nwill have lost the services of Mr O’Loughlin as the manager of the family \nassets, and that loss is capable of being valued in money terms. I have no \ndoubt, in these circumstances, that the judge was entitled to take the course \nthat he did. 17.… Implicit \nin the judge’s findings is the conclusion that Mr O’Loughlin, with his \nflair, could have produced greater benefit to the dependants than a manager \ncould. It follows that not only is there no benefit that I can see which could \nsensibly be prayed in aid by the appellants in reduction of the damages, but \nthis is not a case in which the cost of replacing services would exceed the \nlevel of the lost dependency. 50Judge LJ said: 23.The \nfeatures of the deceased’s working life which created difficulties in the ready \ncalculation of the appropriate level of damages to be allowed to his dependants \nwas that his formal earnings were very modest. Concentrating exclusively on the \nformal level of his remuneration gives a wholly misleading picture of the true \nfinancial worth of his working life. Sometimes, of course, the pay and rewards \nof an individual do not appear to bear any realistic relationship to the \nnotional value which might be attributed to the efforts and responsibilities \nborne by him, whether as an employee, or for that matter, self-employed. Some \nare under-paid: some run businesses which are, for reasons quite unconnected \nwith their own abilities, unsuccessful. In cases like these, where the earnings \nfigures of the deceased in the period leading up to his illness and death come \nto be analysed, there is no gainsaying the actual figures. So, unless, for \nexample, there is evidence to suggest that the individual in question would have \nchanged jobs for better rewards, the notional, often subjective, evaluation of \nwhat an individual’s work should have produced, as opposed to what it did \nproduce, is usually irrelevant. However where, as in the present case, the \ndeceased chose to reward himself very modestly while simultaneously increasing \nhis assets, or put another way, in effect took his rewards for his labour partly \nin income and partly by building up his capital and income creating assets, it \nwould be wholly unjust to assess the damages due to his dependants (or for that \nmatter, if rather than causing death, his injuries had made him permanently \nunemployable) as if the calculation of any consequent loss should be based \nexclusively on the modest salary he paid himself. And the difficulties of \nascertaining the appropriate and fair figure does not mean that the loss is \nspeculative, or unproved. It is merely difficult to quantify. 24.Faced with \nthe difficulties inherent in a claim arising from the dependency on a deceased \nwhose financial position was neither based exclusively, or nearly exclusively, \non income, nor exclusively or nearly exclusively on income derived from capital, \nForbes J accepted the submission that the calculation of the loss sustained \nby the dependants in this case would best be ascertained by evaluating “the \nlikely cost of maintaining developing and enhancing the property portfolio which \nexisted at the date of Mr O’Loughlin’s death”. 25.That \napproach followed from his conclusion, first, that despite her best efforts, the \nwidow of the deceased lacked her husband’s flair and skill as a property \ndeveloper, a view confirmed by the fact that by 1997 she had sold three of the \nproperties without reinvesting the proceeds in further properties, and second, \nby the concessions made by the accountant’[s] evidence called by the defendants \nthat the deceased’s efforts in managing the property portfolio and maintaining \nit, produced a clear economic benefit to the family as a whole. 26.I agree \nwith Mr Alliott’s submission that this was an unusual, probably indeed \nunconventional approach. The question however is whether it was inconsistent \nwith principle, or whether the result was disproportionate. In my view, in this \ncase it was not. Indeed although the analogy is incomplete, as Latham LJ’s \njudgment demonstrates, it is well established that the value of the unpaid \nservices provided by a deceased for his (or her) family may properly involve \nreference to the cost of supplying someone else to provide them. I merely sound \nthe cautionary note that where the court is invited to adopt an unusual or \nunconventional approach in a case of this kind, an additional burden is imposed \non the judge to ensure that the more conventional approach would not provide the \nfairest way to do justice between the parties, and, even if he is satisfied that \nit would not, he should stand back from the figure to which the unconventional \napproach had led him and examine whether it fairly reflected the practical \nrealities of the case. 51Schiemann LJ agreed with both judgments. Consequently, the appeal of the \ndefendants was dismissed with costs. 52O’Loughlinis interesting because it is a case after the UK had abolished \nthe estate’s right to claim loss of future earnings and the achievements of \nMr O’Loughlin were similar in nature to those of HAL although not as \nspectacular. Significantly, Mr O’Loughlin, like HAL, chose to reward \nhimself modestly while increasing his assets. On the other hand, \nMr O’Loughlin did not face the liquidity problem that HAL had come to face \nbefore HAL’s death, a point which I shall elaborate on later. 53InO’Loughlin, it was the defendant’s counsel who suggested that the trial \njudge should have considered the extent to which Mr O’Loughlin’s portfolio \nas managed by him would have been more valuable than the portfolio as managed by \nhis wife. Latham LJ was of the view that this exercise would be too \nspeculative. He therefore preferred the trial judge’s approach of awarding a sum \nequivalent to the cost of replacing the services which Mr O’Loughlin \nperformed, such services being that of a skilled property manager. Naturally, \nsuch services alone would not be an adequate assessment as Mr O’Loughlin, \nlike HAL, was more than a skilled property manager. He was an entrepreneur with \nconsiderable business acumen. Nevertheless, the Court of Appeal decided that \nthat would be an appropriate basis to make an award for loss of \nservices. 54Before me, \nAML’s claim for loss of inheritance was not presented on the basis of a loss of \nHAL’s services but rather a loss of what HAL would have accumulated. It seems to \nme that if such a claim had been made inO’Loughlin, the defendant’s \ncounsel would not have objected. Indeed, as I have said, it was he who suggested \nthat such an exercise be undertaken subject to a deduction for what the wife \ncould have accumulated on her own efforts. It appears that the Court of Appeal \nwas of the view that such an exercise was not objectionable in principle but \nthat it was too speculative to be undertaken. 55Therefore, \nalthough the claim inO’Loughlinfor loss of services was not the same as \nAML’s claim for loss of inheritance, it can be said that the Court of Appeal in \nthat case did not object to a claim for loss of inheritance in principle. \nHowever, it was not argued inO’Loughlinthat a claim for loss of \ninheritance is actually a claim to be made by the estate, and not the \ndependants, and that since the estate may not claim for loss of income after the \n1982 amendment a claim for loss of inheritance or indeed for loss of services \nwhich result in the accumulation of wealth is not maintainable. 56Therefore, \nas regards the claim for loss of Mr O’Loughlin’s services, it seems to me \nthat while one may say that there is no difference in principle between the loss \nof services of a domestic nature and the loss of services which have a positive \nfinancial value, there may well be a difference in the result. Services of a \ndomestic nature, while perhaps having some sort of financial value, do not \nresult in the kind of accumulation of wealth discussed inO’Loughlinwhereas those which have a positive financial value usually do. It is important \nto bear in mind that in the accumulation of wealth, it is really the estate that \nbenefits. The dependants do not benefitquadependants unless the \naccumulation results in an increase in the amount spent on them annually, which \nis a different point. Likewise, there may be services with a positive financial \nvalue which have an immediate financial impact on the dependants and are \nmaintainable in a dependency claim, but that again is a different \npoint. 57While it \nmay seem unjust from a plaintiff’s point of view that a claim for loss of \ninheritance should not be allowed in Singapore because of the 1987 amendment, it \nseems to me that the question is what our Legislature intended. This brings me \nback to the question whether a claim for loss of inheritance is maintainable in \na dependency claim in Singapore. I have so far considered the English position, \nwhich is not clear, and the Privy Council decision inNance,which has been cited in English cases, as well as in Malaysian and Singapore \ncases as I will elaborate later. 58In Hong \nKong, there has also been an amendment to disallow the estate from claiming \nfuture earnings but with the important proviso that the estate may claim for the \ndeceased’s accumulation of wealth. Section 20(2)(b)(iii) of the Hong Kong \nLaw Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance (Cap 23), \nstates: Where a cause of action survives as \naforesaid for the benefit of the estate of a deceased person, the damages \nrecoverable for the benefit of the estate of that person shall, where the death \nof that person has been caused by the act or omission which gives rise to the \ncause of action not include any damages for loss of property, whether income or \notherwise, in respect of any period after his death,except in so far as the \ncourt is satisfied that, but for the act or omission that gave rise to the cause \nof action, the deceased would have achieved an accumulation of wealth by the \ntime that he would otherwise have died, in which case damages may be awarded in \nrespect of the loss of that wealth: Provided that damages awarded under this \nsub-paragraph shall be subject to such deduction as the court considers it just \nto make in the circumstances of any particular case on account of the \naccelerated receipt of that wealth and in order to avoid \nover-compensation. [emphasis added] 59The Law \nReform Commission of Hong Kong’sReport on Damages for Personal Injury and \nDeath, which was presented on 5 October 1984, shows that in Hong Kong, \na dependency claim does not include a claim for savings, although there was a \nsuggestion by Roberts CJ that it should. Hence the Commission recommended \nthat the estate claim for savings should be retained although the rest of its \nclaim for loss of income was to be abolished. I quote parts of the report which \nsaid at ch XI, pp 54–60, 64–69: (a)Claims under the Fatal Accidents Ordinance 11.2The dependants of a \nperson who has died as a result of his injuries are entitled to claim for their \nloss of financial support under the Fatal Accidents Ordinance (‘FAO’). This \nremedy has been available in Hong Kong since 1889. 11.3There are two ways in \nwhich such a claim may be presented. The first and more cumbersome way is to \ncalculate the dependency of each claimant separately and then check the totals \nagainst the deceased’s net annual income at the date of his death. The second \nmethod is explained in Kemp and Kemp,The Quantum of Damages(4thed, 1975) vol 1, pp 235-6 as follows – Start with the deceased’s net income at \nthe date of his death: estimate how much of this he spent on himself: then, if \nhis pattern of life justifies the assumption, take the remainder of his net \nincome as being spent for the benefit of his dependants. In estimating how much the deceased spent \non himself, no account is taken of expenditure on things the cost of which \ncontinues unabated after his death, such as mortgage payments, lighting and \nheating. … (c)The claim under LARCO 11.8Section 20 of \nthe Law Amendment and Reform (Consolidation) Ordinance (‘LARCO’) provides, as a \ngeneral rule, that on the death of any person all causes of action vested in him \nshall survive for the benefit of his estate. This means that the persons named \nin the deceased’s will or, where there is no will, those entitled to claim under \nhis intestacy will obtain any damages recovered in respect of such causes of \naction. ... 11.14… \nThe English Court of Appeal has recently decided, however, that the calculation \nof living expenses for the purposes of the LARCO award are slightly different \nfrom those calculated under the FAO. For the purposes of the FAO the living \nexpenses are those sums which the deceased would have spentexclusivelyon himself, whereas under LARCO they include a pro rata share of sums spent for \nthe joint benefit of the deceased and others (eg rent) (seeHarrisvEmpress Motors Ltd(1984) 1 WLR 212). 11.15Another approach has been suggested in Hong Kong by Roberts CJ inWong \nSai-chuen v Tam Mei-chuen– I suggest that it is open to a trial \njudge, having assessed the FAO dependency:- (a)to apply \nthis figure as the first part of the free balance, unless there is evidence that \nthe amount of dependency might have varied during the lost years; (b)to add to \nthat the deceased’s notional savings during his lost years. As a starting point, it would be \nreasonable, in my view, to adopt the formula … of taking 10% of the deceased’s \nnet earnings as the amount of the notional savings … The natural thrift of the \ninhabitants of Hong Kong suggests that this is not an unreasonable \nassumption. 11.16This \napproach recognises that a person’s income may be used for three purposes – for \nsupporting his dependants, for personal expenses, and for savings. Whereas a \nclaim under the FAO only relates to the amount spent on the dependants, a claim \nunder LARCO should be for the whole of the net income minus the personal \nexpenses, and therefore should include any savings. Hong Kong courts have in a \nnumber of cases therefore awarded more under LARCO than under the FAO \n… … Reform \noptions 11.27We \nare in no doubt that the law relating to damages for the lost years in fatal \ncases is in need of reform. In our view, the fact that a defendant may have to \npay double compensation, under the FAO and LARCO, cannot possibly be justified. \nWe have therefore considered three ways of improving the law, \nnamely:- (a)to abolish \nthe claim under the FAO; (b)to abolish \nthe claim under LARCO; (c)to retain \nboth claims, but limit the claim under LARCO to the loss of net \nsavings. We now propose to consider each \noption. Option (a) 11.28Lord Scarman stated inGammell v Wilsonthat the ‘logical, but \nsocially unattractive, way of reforming the law would be to repeal the Fatal \nAccidents Act … This would leave recovery to the estate; and the dependants \nwould look, as in a family where the breadwinner is not tortiously killed, to \nhim (or her) for their support during life and on death. They would have the \nfinal safeguard of the Inheritance (Provision for Family and Dependants) Act \n1975.’ 11.29We \nare against this approach for several reasons. In our view it is the dependants \nof the deceased who are in the greatest need of compensation in respect of the \nfinancial loss caused by the death. It is therefore wrong to allow the estate to \nclaim the financial loss, since the money may not go to those dependants. It is \ntrue that certain dependants may claim reasonable provision out of the estate \nunder the Deceased’s Family Maintenance Ordinance but this is a round-about \nprocedure and in any event it only protects a limited class of persons. \nFurthermore the class under the FAO is well established and the courts are used \nto dealing with such claims. We conclude, as did Lord Scarman that ‘the \nprotection of the fatal accidents legislation has been with us for so long that \n[we] doubt whether its repeal would be welcomed.’ Option (b) 11.30The \nsecond approach is to abolish the claim under LARCO for damages for the lost \nyears in fatal cases. … 11.31There are, however, arguments against the complete abolition of the LARCO claim. \nThe main criticism of the present law is that it allows double recovery in \nrespect of the money which would have been spent on the dependants of the \ndeceased. If the LARCO claim were to be abolished, however, it would mean that \nthe deceased’s estate would be deprived not only of the sums which would have \nbeen spent on the dependants, but also of the amount which the deceased would \nhave saved. This leads us to consider our third option. Option (c) 11.32This \noption involves the retention of claims under both the FAO and LARCO, but is \naimed at eliminating any double recovery. As has been pointed out above, double \nrecovery may occur because the sums that would have been spent on the deceased’s \ndependants are not deducted from the LARCO award. This anomaly could be overcome \nby requiring the courts to make such a deduction. The effect would be that the \nLARCO award would be calculated by reference to the net savings which the \ndeceased would have made had he lived a normal lifespan (the “net savings \nmethod”). Such an approach was in fact adopted in the Hong Kong case ofVSL \nEngineers (HK) Ltd v. Yeung Wing[1981] HKLR 407, and although \nthe Court of Appeal subsequently disapproved this method of calculation, Roberts \nCJ thought it had some attraction. He observed that – The net savings method has attractions. \nIt involves a relatively simple calculation. It treats the amount which the \ndeceased handed to his wife for her maintenance in the same way as that which he \nhanded to her for his maintenance. It ensures that there would accrue to the \ndeceased’s estate only what, had he lived, would have been found in it at his \ndeath, because he would have saved it. And it avoids the inflation of LARCO \nawards by the amount of the dependency, which will appear in the FAO award as \nwell. (SeeWong Sai-chuen dec’d v Tam \nMei-chun(1982) Civ App No 133 of 1981) Since the net savings method takes into \naccount the sum which the deceased would have spent on his dependants there is \nno overlap between the LARCO claim and awards under the FAO. No merger of these \nawards should therefore take place. 11.33This \napproach is also consistent with the rule that in assessing damages for \npecuniary loss, the principle of full compensation should be applied. \n… Where the deceased would have saved part \nof his income during the lost years there is no doubt that his estate has been \ndeprived of that money. Damages should therefore compensate the estate for this \nloss. Our \nrecommendations 11.34The \nprovisional view of the sub-committee was that option (c) should be adopted. \n… 11.35Some \ncommentators pointed out that it was incorrect to regard the net savings as the \nonly surplus left from the net income after deductions are made for personal \nexpenses and sums spent on the dependants. We acknowledge the logic of this. \nThere may be other amounts which were dealt with in other ways by the deceased. \nNevertheless we are of the view that the estate should only be able to claim for \nthe loss of those sums which would have been saved by the deceased. If other \nuses made by the deceased of his money were to be taken into account we feel \nthis would create an unacceptable level of speculation as to whether that money \nshould be regarded as a loss to the estate. 11.36Another commentator considered that lost years awards had considerably increased \nthe level of awards and that the social cost of this increase was not justified. \nWe sympathise with this view but do not consider that this should lead us to \nrecommend that total abolition of damages for the lost years. Our recommendation \nthat only the loss of savings should be recovered would, if implemented, reduce \nthe level of awards considerably. 11.37The \nsame commentator also regarded the degree of speculation involved in lost years \nclaims as unacceptable. This does seem to us to be a valid criticism. A degree \nof speculation enters into claims for loss of dependency under the FAO, but in \nthe case of claims under LARCO, the amount of speculation may be much greater. \nIn some cases the courts have held that where some matters are very speculative \nthey would simply consider the facts as at the date of death and not make any \nguesses as to what the future might hold (see eg Lee Kai-cheungvYim \nTat-kuen(1983) HCA No 1374 of 1983). In our view this approach should \nbe adopted in all cases relating to lost years in fatal cases. We recommend that \na LARCO claim for damages for the lost years should only lie in respect of the \nloss of saving during the lost years, and that such a loss should be calculated \non the basis of the established pattern of savings (if there is one) of the \ndeceased prior to the accident. This approach will eliminate speculation as to \nthe future savings habits and will make settlements easier to arrange. It will \nenable the estate of a deceased person with an established pattern of savings \n(eg a middle-aged family man) to recover the loss of future savings, but will \neliminate claims in the case of a young person with no savings pattern. In our \nview this approach is preferable to the total abolition of damages for the lost \nyears and yet has a degree of certainty and simplicity. 11.38The \ndiscussion of the lost years has so far concentrated on the loss of income \nduring those years. In most cases this will be the only financial loss in that \nperiod. It is possible, however, that there may be other losses. In the recent \ncases ofAdsettvWest[1983] 3 WLR 437 it was held \nthat a claim for the lost years could include a claim for the loss of an \ninheritance during those years. That decision led to the rather bizarre result \nthat the father of the deceased who was the beneficiary of the estate, could \nclaim for his son’s loss of inheritance from the father. In our view such losses \nshould not be recoverable as being too speculative. … 60In the \nsummary of its recommendations, the Commission said (at ch XIII, \np 81): 13.26The \nlaw relating to the ‘lost years’ in fatal cases should be reformed \n(paras 11.1-27). The claim under LARCO for the lost years should be reduced \nso that it represents only the net savings which the deceased would have made \nduring the lost years. The award should be calculated on the basis of the \nestablished savings pattern (if any) of the deceased at the time of the accident \n(paras 11.32–40). 61The \nCommission suggested the following terms of amendment on this point (at p \n93): 2.Section 20 of the principal Ordinance is amended – (a)… (b)in \nsubsection (2) by deleting paragraph (a) and substituting the following \n– “(a)shall not include \n– (i)… (ii)… (iii)… (iv)any damages for \nloss of income in respect of any period after his death, except where before the \ndate on which the cause of action accrued he had established a pattern of making \nsavings from income, in which case the damages shall include an amount \ncalculated on the basis of that pattern, subject to such deduction as the court \nthinks fit on account of the accelerated payment of any such lost income for \nwhich damages are awarded;”; … 62As it \nturned out, the amendment was in different terms from those proposed by the \nCommission. I have set out the actual amendment in [58] above. It seems that in \nHong Kong, the estate may claim for loss of accumulation of wealth which is not \nconfined to any established pattern of savings. Be that as it may, it is clear \nthat in Hong Kong, a dependency claim does not include a claim for loss of \nsavings. 63Closer to \nhome is the Malaysian case ofChan Yoke May v Lian Seng Co Ltd[1962] MLJ 243. There, Suffian J was considering the amount of \ndamages to be awarded under s 7 of the Civil Law Ordinance 1956. \nCitingNance, he was of the view that the amount the deceased would have \nsaved should be included in the general damages. Again, there did not seem to be \nany dispute on the point in that case. Furthermore, Mr Hwang did not cite \nany recent Malaysian case which would demonstrate that in Malaysia, a claim for \nloss of inheritance is maintainable in a dependency claim. On the other hand, \nMr Loh did not cite any recent Malaysian case which would demonstrate that \na claim for loss of inheritance is not maintainable in a dependency \nclaim. 64For \nSingapore, neither counsel cited a case which was exactly on the point. However, \nMr Hwang relied onSingapore Bus Service (1978) Ltd v Lim Soon Yong[1982–1983] SLR 167 (“Lim Soon Yong”). There, the plaintiff’s \nhusband was killed in a motor accident on 26 May 1979,iebefore the \n1982 amendment in the UK and before the 1987 amendment in Singapore. The \nplaintiff brought a dependency claim under s 8 of the Civil Law Act(Cap 30, 1970 Rev Ed) on behalf of herself as well as the \nchildren and parents of the deceased. No claim was brought on behalf of the \nestate. One of the heads of claim was the contributions the deceased and his \nemployer would have made to the Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) for his account. \nContributions to the CPF are special savings mandated by law in Singapore and at \nthat time could be withdrawn by the wage earner when he reached 55 years of age. \nThis was one of the issues that the Court of Appeal had to grapple with. \nF A Chua J, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, said \nat 169, [14]–[15]: The contention of the appellants is that \nthe CPF contributions cannot form part of a dependency claim. It is money held \nin trust by the CPF Board and when the contributor reaches the age of 55 it \nwould go to the contributor. If the contributor dies before the age of 55 the \nmoney is paid to the nominee, but not as a dependant. It is not money on which \nthe family depends from day to day. We are unable to accept the contention of \nthe appellants. CPF contributions are not chargeable with estate duty. The money \ndoes not go to the estate of the contributor. In this case it goes to the widow \nand the parents of the deceased. Had the deceased lived to the age of 55 he \nwould have withdrawn the sum standing to his credit in the CPF and the widow and \nchildren would necessarily have benefited from the deceased having this money if \nnot for this accident. In our view, therefore, the CPF contributions do form \npart of the widow’s dependency claim. 65The \ndefendant appealed to the Privy Council (reported at [1985] 1 WLR \n1075) and the sole issue there was whether the claim for the CPF \ncontributions was maintainable. The Privy Council was aware that the appellant \nwas contending that such a claim should have been made by the estate instead. In \ndelivering the judgment of the Privy Council, Sir Edward Eveleigh cited the \njudgment of the Court of Appeal below. He also cited the judgment of Viscount \nSimon inNanceregarding the assumption that, according to the law of \nBritish Columbia, it would be proper to award a sum representing a portion of \nany additional savings which the deceased might have accumulated. \nSir Edward was of the view that Viscount Simon was dealing with a \ndependency claim and not an estate claim. Sir Edward then said at \n1079–1080: The deceased would have continued to \ncontribute [to the CPF] and so would his employer if the accident had not \noccurred for payment was compulsory under the Act [meaning the CPF Act]. … Had \nhe died before the age of 55 his dependants would have been entitled to their \nportions by virtue of section 12(5). The deceased might have lived beyond \n55 and withdrawn the sum standing to his credit. In that event it is reasonable \nto infer that he would have used the money not only for his own benefit but for \nthe benefit of his dependants. To the extent that he did not spend it he would \nhave saved it and his dependants, particularly his widow who was younger than he \nwas, would reasonably have expected to inherit from him. The fact that the deceased’s estate might \nhave had a claim for the value of lost contributions to the Fund in no way \naffects the right of the dependants to claim for their own loss. The fact that, \nin England, before the Administration of Justice Act 1982 damages could be \nclaimed by the estate for loss of the ability to earn over the “lost years” (seeGammell v Wilson) did not take away the right of dependants to claim for \ntheir loss of dependency. The claim by the estate might affect the valuation of \nthe claim by the dependants to the extent that they benefited from the estate \nbut the two claims are independently sustainable. 66The \napproach of the Privy Council inLim Soon Yongwas not exactly the same \nas that of the Court of Appeal. The Court of Appeal considered the CPF \ncontributions as distinct from the estate of the deceased and allowed such \ncontributions to be claimed because the deceased would have withdrawn the sum \nstanding to his credit in the CPF and spent it on his wife and children before \nhis death, although he had aged parents as dependants too. While the Privy \nCouncil took into account the point that the deceased would have withdrawn his \nCPF savings and spent it on his dependants (and not just on the wife and \nchildren), the Privy Council also took into account the fact that the wife was \nlikely to have inherited whatever the deceased would have saved from so much of \nhis CPF contributions which would not have been spent. The Privy Council also \nappeared to have been influenced by the fact that at that time, the estate was \nnot precluded by law from claiming the savings. 67With \nrespect, it seems to me that the Privy Council had erred in taking into account \nthe fact that the wife would have inherited the savings from the CPF \ncontributions. That would have been an estate claim. As I have said, inNance, it was assumed that a claim for savings was maintainable in a \ndependency claim. 68Lim Soon \nYonghas since been cited with approval in Singapore to allow a dependency \nclaim to include a claim for future CPF contributions. Apparently, it has not \nbeen cited for the proposition that future savings are claimable in a dependency \nclaim. Indeed, if future savings had been generally claimable in a dependency \nclaim, the CPF contributions would not have been an issue inLim Soon \nYong. 69Accordingly, it is my view thatLim Soon Yongis not an authority that \nsupports AML’s claim for loss of inheritance. Instead, it suggests that such a \nclaim is not maintainable. 70I come now \nto my decision inTan Harry. There, the dependants were aged parents of \nthe deceased who died intestate on 1 October 1999 after an anaesthetic \nprocedure administered by the first defendant. The deceased was not married and \nhad no children. One of the issues there was the amount of the multiplicand. The \nplaintiffs contended that the multiplicand used by the assistant registrar \nshould be increased by,inter alia, taking into account 50% of the \ndeceased’s savings. I did not take into account the deceased’s savings because \nit was unlikely that the plaintiffs would have outlived the deceased but for the \nunfortunate incident. It can be argued that had the plaintiffs been the younger \nwife and children of the deceased, I would have taken into account the savings \nand hence, in principle, a claim for loss of savings is maintainable in a \ndependency claim. However, inTan Harry,it was assumed that loss of \nsavings was a maintainable claim in a dependency claim. Neither counsel for the \nfirst defendant,iethe anaesthetist, or counsel for the second \ndefendant,iethe hospital, had taken the point that a claim for loss of \nsavings is really an estate claim and hence not maintainable in view of the 1987 \namendment. On the facts inTan Harry, I did not take into account the \nloss of savings, but for a different reason. In the circumstances,Tan \nHarryis not authority for the proposition that a claim for loss of savings \nis maintainable in a dependency claim. 71As I \nmentioned inTan Harry, thePractitioners’ Library –Assessment of Damages: Personal Injuries and Fatal \nAccidents(Butterworths Asia, 2001) suggests that the dependency claim is \ncalculated by adding up all the benefits received by the dependants or by \nsplitting the deceased’s income into what he would have spent on himself and on \nhis dependants. There is no express mention therein about loss of savings \nalthough that is not expressly excluded either. It seems to me that if loss of \nsavings were part of a dependency claim, it would have been expressly mentioned \nas a head of claim. 72It seems \nthat, generally, cases in England and in Hong Kong deal with loss of savings as \na part of earned income. This is different from the kind of claim which AML is \nmaking under loss of inheritance. AML is claiming for something over and above \nHAL’s earned income. In that context, loss of savings is not interchangeable \nwith loss of inheritance. 73Coming back \nto the speech of Prof Jayakumar when he was moving the second reading of \nthe Bill on the 1987 amendments, the minister was clearly aware of amendments \nmade in the UK and in Hong Kong as he had alluded to them. He said similar \namendments had been made in other countries but he did not say identical \namendments had been made there. He must have been aware that in Hong Kong the \nclaim for loss of savings is not part of the dependency claim and was saved for \nthe estate claim. As I have said, the Hong Kong amendment allows a claim for \nloss of accumulation of wealth which is potentially larger than a claim for loss \nof savingsper se. Singapore does not have that provision. The question \nthen is whether Singapore omitted to provide for a loss of inheritance or loss \nof savings claim for the estate claim because that was already part of the \ndependency claim or irrespective of it being excluded from the dependency claim. \nI am of the view that it was the latter. Such a claim has not been recognised as \nsuch by the Singapore courts. While this may appear unjust to claimants like \nAML, there are considerations at the other end of the scale. Such claims are by \nnature in the minority. The majority of people working in Singapore would be \nsalaried workers, not entrepreneurs. Even among entrepreneurs, not all are \nsuccessful and few can claim to be very successful. Of those few, there would be \nsome who pay themselves modest salaries and bonuses while keeping the rest of \ntheir gains for accumulation of further wealth. Others would still pay \nthemselves huge salaries and bonuses while also keeping a part of their gains \nfor accumulation of further wealth. However, in either case, where the \nentrepreneur has been very successful, the claim for loss of inheritance would \nbe very large indeed. Such a burden would eventually be borne by the public who \npay premiums for all kinds of insurance cover. A few would benefit at the \nexpense of the majority. In any event, it is not for this court to say how the \nscales should be balanced. Suffice it for me to conclude that at present, the \nLegislature has decided that the scales should be in favour of the majority by \nnot including the Hong Kong proviso which allows an estate to claim for loss of \naccumulation of wealth. For present purposes, I equate the loss of accumulation \nof wealth with a loss of inheritance although the former would probably not \ninclude the kind of claim for loss of inheritance as inAdsett v West[1983] QB 826. 74I would \nmention that to allow dependants to claim for loss of inheritance would be to \nintroduce a host of complexities. Supposing a child dependant would remain a \ndependant for only one more year after the death of the deceased but \nnevertheless has a reasonable expectation of being a beneficiary of the estate \nas she is named as a beneficiary in the deceased’s will. Will that child be \nentitled to claim her entire share of the loss of inheritance proportionate to \nwhat was given to her in the will or only a small percentage thereof, and if the \nlatter, how would that percentage be calculated? Take another example. Supposing \na wife has her own successful career and is dependent on her husband to a small \nextent, but enough to qualify her as a dependant. There are child dependants who \nenjoy more financial support from the deceased when he was living than the wife \nbut the children will not remain as dependants for very much longer. The wife is \nnamed as the main beneficiary in the deceased’s will. Would that mean that she \nis entitled to claim more for herself than the children in the loss of \ninheritance claim? 75Perhaps it \nis preferable to allow an estate claim for loss of inheritance with a cap on the \nquantum and with a qualification that such a claim is permissible only to the \nextent that the beneficiaries of the estate are also dependants so as to avoid \nbenefiting distant relatives of the deceased. That will not address all the \ncomplexities I have mentioned and others not mentioned, but it will address the \napparent injustice that someone like AML will face. In any event, that is a \nmatter for the Legislature, as I have said. 76I should \nmention that Mr Hwang also referred to cases from the US, Canada and \nAustralia to support the claim for loss of inheritance. It is unnecessary for me \nto deal with them as they do not assist me to reach a conclusion on the \nSingapore position. It is also unnecessary for me to refer to the various \ntextbooks which Mr Hwang cited as they rely on cases which I have dealt \nwith.",
        "Quantum of the claim for \nloss of inheritance": "77In the \ncircumstances, the quantum of the claim for loss of inheritance is academic. \nHowever, as much time was spent on this issue, I will say something about it. \nReferences to dollar values will be to dollars in the US currency unless \notherwise indicated. 78HAL had \nattended Georgia State College on a scholarship. After graduation, he began \nworking as an actuary with Life Insurance Company. In 1970, he resigned from his \njob and began selling life insurance with Aetna Life & Consulting Company \n(“Aetna”) and sold life insurance policies with premiums amounting to more than \none million dollars. It was during this period that he began to study real \nestate investments. While selling life insurance, he began to make investments \nin real estate and deal in real estate on weekends. By 1972, he quit his job at \nAetna and devoted his efforts to using real estate to accumulate \nwealth. 79In the \nearly 1970s, HAL bought inexpensive land in outlying rural areas, sub-divided \nthem and sold the sub-divided land to others. By the middle of the 1970s, he \nfocused on buying timber land. He would sell standing timber on the land before \ncompleting his land purchases. In this way, he used the proceeds of the timber \nsales to pay for most or all of the purchase prices for the land and standing \ntimber. He was a very hardworking man, working at least 16 hours a day for seven \ndays a week and subsequently, lesser hours on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. He \nhad no hobbies. 80HAL \nrewarded himself modestly, as much of the available funds were reinvested in \nland or used to pay bank borrowings. 81In 1983, \nHAL moved his business office from a house to an office complex. By the end of \nthe 1980s, HAL and a business partner, James Baker, were in the process of \nbuilding a 58,000 sq ft, freestanding office building or corporate \ncentre. 82In 1983, \nHAL’s family moved to a larger home and he invested in a condominium unit in \nFlorida where the family took their summer vacations. 83From 1990, \nHAL’s salaried income from the two companies he controlled increased. The two \ncompanies were Lassiter Properties, Inc (“LP”) in which he had a 100% interest \nand MDI International, Inc (“MDI”) in which he had a 98% interest. On \n6 February 1991, HAL also obtained a lease and option to purchase an \napproximately 10,000 sq ft house in Emerald Drive which was the only \nhouse situated on a four-acre peninsula on Lake Spivey in South \nAtlanta. 84Dr Bruce A Seaman was the expert witness for AML’s claim for loss of \ninheritance. He has an impressivecurriculum vitae. He is a tenured \nAssociate Professor of Economics and a Senior Associate in the Fiscal Research \nProgram in the Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, Georgia State University \nat Atlanta, Georgia. He formerly served as Chair of the Department of Economics. \nHe also has other appointments and was President of the Association for Cultural \nEconomics International at the time he issued his first and supplemental reports \non February 2001 and 2002. He has various professional affiliations and awards. \nHe has various fields of specialisation including Law and Economics/Forensic \nEconomics and Economic Impact Analysis. He has numerous publications and has \nextensive experience as an expert witness in civil trials and has testified in \nnumerous trials involving damages related to the value of a deceased’s life in \ncases throughout the US. 85In his \nfirst report, Dr Seaman noted that HAL’s estate was estimated at about \n$39.1m as at the date of his death. Using a five-year period from 1985 to 1990 \nas an example, he said HAL’s net wealth grew from about $25m to about $150m. The \ncompound annual growth rate was nearly 43%. Notwithstanding some financial \nproblems confronted by HAL in the early 1990s which HAL had to deal with through \nthe bankruptcy courts, Dr Seaman was of the view that this led to a \ntemporary reduction in HAL’s wealth at the time of death and HAL was “again \npoised to accumulate wealth”. Using 20% or 25% of the 43% compound annual growth \nrate would yield a compound annual growth rate of 8.6% or 10.75%. Assuming HAL \nworked until 70 years of age, Dr Seaman estimated HAL’s net worth to be \nabout $234m to $358m. If these figures were calculated to the value as at, say, \nthe date of his first report,ie15 February 2001, Dr Seaman \nestimated the loss of inheritance to be between about $98m to $149m, but in any \ncase, no lower than about $66m. 86In \nDr Seaman’s supplemental report dated 25 February 2002, he included an \nalternative approach by suggesting a 10.75% growth rate between 1994 to 2001 and \n4.3% growth rate (being half of 8.6%) beyond 27 February 2002. HAL would \nhave accumulated about $155m. The present value of that sum as at \n27 February 2002 would be about $69m. 87However, \nMr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman was an unreliable witness. 88Firstly, he \nsubmitted that although Dr Seaman had mentioned that HAL had faced some \nfinancial complications through the bankruptcy courts, Dr Seaman had not \nstated plainly in either of his reports that HAL had in fact filed for \nChapter 11 bankruptcy in November 1991. 89Secondly, \nalthough Dr Seaman had listed the documents he had considered for his \nreports, he did not list any bankruptcy documents which he subsequently admitted \nhe had considered, like a reorganisation plan and disclosure \nstatement. 90Thirdly, \nduring the evidence-in-chief of Dr Seaman, he decided to lower his \nassessment about the loss of inheritance to 45% of $66m,ieabout $30m, \nwhich he said would be his most defensible case for loss of \ninheritance. 91Fourthly, \nMr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman had not mentioned in his reports the \nchange in banking regulations from 1990 resulting in a savings and loan crisis \n(“S&L crisis”) which affected the viability of HAL’s real estate business. \nLoans were no longer easily available for the purchase of undeveloped land. On \nthe other hand, Dr Seaman claimed during cross-examination that he had \ntaken the S&L crisis into account as it changed how HAL was going to do \nbusiness. 92Fifthly, \nDr Seaman had used the years 1985 to 1990 to derive the compounded annual \ngrowth rate of nearly 43%. However, this was the highest growth rate for HAL. \nThe period between 1990 and 1994 would show instead a negative growth \nrate. 93Sixthly, \nDr Seaman had not mentioned in either of his reports that HAL had been \nindicted under the Georgia Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization \n(“RICO”) Act which would affect his standing with banks. Dr Seaman claimed \nin cross-examination that he had taken this into account. 94Seventhly, \nMr Loh criticised some errors in calculations made by Dr Seaman which \nit is not necessary for me to set out. 95Eighthly, \nMr Loh pointed out that Dr Seaman was floating around various figures \nas the loss of inheritance. I have mentioned some of them above. Others were \nmentioned by Dr Seaman during oral testimony. 96Ninthly, \nDr Seaman had claimed during cross-examination that HAL’s estate was worth \nactually $100m as at the date of his death. It was reduced to $39.1m because of \na downward adjustment made by the US government because of a key man discount \nsince HAL was no longer around. However, eventually Dr Seaman had to accept \nthat no such discount was applied to reach the $39.1m figure. 97Tenthly, \nMr Loh submitted that Dr Seaman’s recommendations relied heavily on \nthe views of others as Dr Seaman did not know HAL personally. \nDr Seaman himself said: However, there is no doubt that at the \ntime of his death, he was again poised to continue to accumulate wealth, as \nattested to by the other affidavits and financial documents that serve as a \nrecord in this case. 98I am of the view that the \narguments made by Mr Loh were well taken. Notwithstanding Mr Hwang’s \nattempts to counter Mr Loh’s arguments in order to portray Dr Seaman \nas a reliable and conservative expert witness, it is clear to me that \nDr Seaman was nothing of the sort. It was telling that Mr Hwang made \nthe following oral submissions before me: (a)“At the end of the day, I would not place so much \nemphasis on Dr Seaman’s evidence as expert evidence. He is putting together \na bunch of assumptions. In saying how much [HAL] would have earned, his guess is \nas good as yours or mine”; (b)“He is a vehicle for a mathematical table of \npossibilities”; (c)“Seaman gave us a platform to make our arguments which \nwe could have made without him”; (d)“We do not rely on Dr Seaman as the primary prover \nof the point that [HAL] was poised to accumulate wealth”; (e)“All we are offering Dr Seaman for is to offer a \nmethodology”. 99Furthermore, AML herself was not a credible witness. In her first affidavit of \nevidence-in-chief (“AEIC”), she had suggested that things were looking up from \n1990. For example, she said in para 21 of her first AEIC that by 1990, HAL \nwas not required to reinvest every dollar in the business to reach his goals. \nCommencing in 1990 until his death in 1994, his salaried income from LP and MDI \nsteadily increased. Paragraph 22(a) of her first AEIC mentioned how, in \nFebruary 1991, HAL obtained a lease and option to purchase the Emerald Drive \nproperty I have mentioned. Paragraphs 40 and 41 of her first AEIC stated \nhow HAL’s land dealings were conducted in his own personal way and as there was \nno one to take his place, AML had to adopt a ten-year liquidation plan for LP \nand HAL’s individual land holdings. Paragraph 42 of her first AEIC stated \nthat HAL was providing the leadership, vision and direction, and financing for \nMDI. In the preceding years before his death, MDI had been increasing its gross \nrevenues and net profits. MDI continued to operate profitably in 1995 as a \nresult of momentum but because of the void in leadership, vision and direction \ncaused by HAL’s death, MDI started to experience a net operating loss from 1996 \nwhich increased annually. By 1999, MDI itself had to file for Chapter 11 \nbankruptcy. 100As Mr Loh submitted, although LP was HAL’s main business, AML’s first AEIC \ndid not dwell on its business between 1990 and 1994 and focused instead on MDI. \nIt was after Dr Seaman’s first report was disclosed that Mr Loh had an \ninkling about the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings involving HAL and three \nof his companies,ieLP, Ansley Development Corporation and Little \nHenry’s Food Stores Inc. Mr Loh subsequently learnt that on 4 November \n1991, HAL had filed such proceedings for himself and the three companies. LP \nactually had a negative worth of $5.497m as at HAL’s death. 101Even for MDI, the Disclosure Statement filed for its own bankruptcy proceedings \nrevealed that increasing revenues disguised some fundamental problems that had \ndeveloped by early 1994,iebefore HAL’s death, and ultimately proved \nimpossible to overcome. This Disclosure Statement listed five factors for the \nfundamental problems: (a)MDI’s \nproducts were subjected to increasing competition from other companies. By the \nbeginning of 1994, the Small Computer Systems Interface (“SCSI”) Express product \nof MDI was experiencing competition from companies which were much better \ncapitalised than MDI and therefore enjoyed much larger budgeting for marketing, \nand for research and development; (b)MDI’s \nconcentration on a Novell operating platform subjected its products to \ncompetition from Microsoft NT; (c)MDI was \nnot able to reorient its SCSI Express products to Microsoft NT \nbecause: (i)MDI \nhad limited funds to undertake the necessary research and \ndevelopment; (ii)MDI had \naligned itself with Novell as a marketing partner, and had embedded itself in a \ndistribution and reseller network which was oriented toward Novell \nproducts; (d)Novell \nchanged its relationship from a marketing partner to a competitor; (e)The \ntwo-tier sales channel MDI used was falling apart due to a series of \nconsolidations, bankruptcies and liquidations of distributors with whom MDI had \ntraditionally done business. 102A sixth factor was the death of HAL. However, as Mr Loh pointed out, a \nMercer Capital valuation report, which had been prepared for estate filing, had \nmentioned that HAL had been withdrawing money from MDI to repay part of his \nloans to MDI because of his other financial commitments and so critical \ninvestments were not being made in product development and in strengthening the \nbalance sheet. 103Mr Hwang, however, relied on Daniel Pieplow’s evidence that had HAL been \nalive, he would have addressed MDI’s problems. Mr Pieplow was the Chief \nFinancial Officer of MDI. Yet, HAL’s involvement in MDI was described in a \nnewspaper article as follows: As he begins to expand and diversify his \nholdings … Lassiter will have to bring in outside talent, partners and \nexpertise. And he’ll have to curb his compulsive risk taking. A case in point: \nIn 1987 Lassiter invested $3 million in Micro Design International Inc … With no \nknowledge for computers, Lassiter apparently based the investment on an employee \nwho heard about the deal from a neighbour who knew a fellow who knew the man who \nran the company. Two years later Lassiter filed suit … claiming he’d been duped \n… The case has since been settled with Lassiter now assuming total control of \nMicro Design. 104It seems to me that in view of MDI’s problems even when HAL was alive, HAL was \nnot the panacea for MDI’s problems as Mr Pieplow wanted to believe. \nHowever, the same newspaper article also described HAL as a driven self-made \nmillionaire from the wrong side of Atlanta and described his one goal in life to \nbe a billionaire and his overriding interest to be to catch and surpass the \nultimate dealmeister, Donald Trump. 105Mr Hwang emphasised that HAL was a healthy, hardworking, intelligent, \nexperienced and skilled entrepreneur. He was not a one-trick pony. Furthermore, \nHAL’s estate was worth $39.1m and this was a figure assessed by the relevant \ngovernment organisation in the US. 106Mr Loh argued that the estate was hardly worth anything. HAL’s gross estate \nwas supposed to be worth $57.1m. From that sum, $10.1m should be deducted for \ninsurance. He had debts of about $7.9m leaving a net amount of about $39.1m. Of \nthis sum, about $20m was in stocks and bonds and this included stocks in MDI \nwhich was valued at about $18.3m by Mercer Capital but which eventually turned \nout to be worthless. There was also a loan of about $6.8m by HAL to MDI which \nwould also be worthless since MDI was going down. Mr Loh also submitted \nthat even AML had claimed that MDI was not worth $18.3m in order to minimise \nestate taxes. 107I am of the view that even if MDI were worthless, HAL’s estate was still worth \nabout $14m,ieafter deducting $18.3m and $6.8m from $39.1m. Furthermore, \nas Mr Hwang had stressed, HAL himself was not insolvent although he was \nfacing liquidity problems. The Chapter 11 reorganisation for HAL and his \nthree companies received creditor support and they were supposed to be paid \n100 cents to the dollar with interest at prime plus one per cent although \nthis would be over perhaps 15 years. There was no suggestion of any default. I \naccept that with the reorganisation, HAL would have been free to engage in \ndeals. He was a hardworking self-made man with proven entrepreneurial skills. \nThis is not a case of an infant victim where the evidence about the ability to \nearn income or accumulate wealth would be sparse. 108On the other hand, HAL’s successes were more in respect of his property deals \nfor which he would have had to be able to borrow large sums of money easily. He \nwould not be able to do this with the change in banking regulations. Secondly, \nhis reputation would have been tarnished by the Chapter 11 proceedings and \nthe charges under the Georgia RICO Act. Thirdly, he took great risks. In the \nsame newspaper article I have mentioned, AML was quoted as saying: [HAL] is a gambler. He thrives on it. If \nsomething went wrong, we’d be gone tomorrow. 109In \nthe circumstances, while it may be likely that HAL would have been able to \ncontinue providing AML with the same level of financial support as he had done \nbefore his death, it is difficult to say that he would have continued to \naccumulate wealth to the tune of millions of dollars and to say exactly how much \nwealth he would have accumulated. Accordingly, I would not have awarded more \nthan $1m for loss of inheritance if that claim were maintainable in a dependency \nclaim.",
        "Loss of \nsupport": "110As regards the claim for loss of support, Mr Loh submitted that because AML \nwould derive income from HAL’s estate which was assessed at $39.1m, the interest \non that alone would be sufficient to compensate AML for her loss of support. \nHence, AML had in fact suffered no loss. Mr Loh relied ondictainKandalla v British Airways Board[1980] 1 All ER 341, where \nGriffith J said at 349: As a further illustration, consider the \nposition of a very high earner of 38 years of age who is also possessed of a \nlarge fortune. Suppose he is contributing £10,000 per annum to the support of \nhis wife and family during his lifetime and on his death leaves them an estate \nof, say, £500,000. The interest on the estate is more than adequate to replace \nthe dependency of £10,000 per annum and so the accelerated benefit from the \nestate extinguishes any Fatal Accidents Acts claim. 111Mr Loh also submitted that although I had said inTan Harrythat \nthere should be no deduction for whatever a younger spouse may receive by way of \ninheritance, I should re-consider that decision. I also mention that although \nAML was of the same age as HAL, Mr Loh did not suggest that she was likely \nto pre-decease HAL but for the accident and Mr Loh’s argument was on the \npremise that AML would have survived HAL but for HAL’s accident. 112Mr Loh’s argument about interest being earned on HAL’s estate of $39.1m was \non the contingency that I might not agree with his contention that HAL’s estate \nwas not worth that amount at the time of his death. 113In any event, whether HAL’s estate was worth $31.1m, or $14m if MDI were \nworthless, I am of the view that I should not take into account the interest \nearned from the capital for the purpose of determining the quantum of AML’s loss \nof support. 114InTan Harry, I had referred to the Privy Council decision inKassam v \nKampala Aerated Water Co Ltd[1965] 2 All ER 875. In that case, \nthe Privy Council decided that there should not be a deduction in a dependency \nclaim for the acceleration of benefit which the young dependants had received \nfrom the estate of the deceased, having regard to the anticipated savings which \nthe deceased might reasonably have been expected to make. This decision was \ncited with approval by Choor Singh J inNeo Seo Thun v Ng Peng Hui[1975–1977] SLR 345. InTan Harry, I was of the view that there \nshould not be any deduction for the acceleration of benefit where the dependants \nwould in any event ultimately inherit the assets, although at a later time. That \nview was expressed in the context of the question as to whether there should be \na deduction for the acceleration of capital. If there should not be a deduction \nfor the acceleration of capital, there should also not be a deduction for the \ninterest earned on capital. I see no reason to depart from the view I expressed \ninTan Harryon the point. 115It was not suggested by Mr Loh that the capital as at HAL’s death would \nhave been eventually lost by HAL had he not been killed. In any case, that is \ntoo speculative an occurrence for me to give any weight to. 116Mr Loh also submitted that AML should not be entitled to claim for loss of \nsupport because, after HAL’s death, AML was drawing salaries from LP and MDI in \nexcess of what HAL had been providing her. Mr Loh relied onYap Ami v \nTan Hui Pang[1982] 2 MLJ 316(“Yap Ami”). In that case, \nthe deceased was killed in a hunting accident. He was a partner in a business \nand was drawing a certain sum per month. After his death, the partnership \ncontinued to pay the dependants what the deceased used to draw. The trial judge \nfound that there the dependants did not suffer any loss. In fact they were \ngetting more than when the deceased was still living as he would have retained a \nportion of what was drawn for his personal needs. The dependants’ appeal to the \nFederal Court of Malaysia was dismissed. 117Mr Loh also referred toJung Estatev Krimmer(1990) \n47 BCLR (2d) 145 (“Jung”). The deceased was a director of a company. \nHe was drawing a salary of $74,000 of which he provided $36,000 for family \nexpenses. After he died, his widow drew a director’s fee of $50,000. In that \ncase, the widow did not claim for loss of dependency. 118Therefore, although Mr Loh accepted that the law is such that what a \ndependant earns after the death of the deceased should be disregarded for the \nclaim for loss of support, Mr Loh submitted that an exception exists where \nthe dependant does not actually go out to the market and get a job but continues \nto draw the deceased’s salary in his stand as in the cases ofYap AmiandJung. Mr Loh relied on AML’s evidence that as chairperson of the \nboard of LP, she had no choice other than to adopt a ten-year liquidation plan \nfor LP. As the chairperson of the board of MDI, she had attempted to retain \nmanagers but eventually MDI was no longer able to continue its operations. \nMr Loh also relied on the evidence of Mr Pieplow who said that when \nAML and one of her daughters became involved in MDI, they did not really have \nany experience and one of the first things that had to be done was to make up a \ndictionary to explain basic terms to them. Thus Mr Loh submitted that AML \nwas not employed by LP and MDI for her abilities but rather so that she could \ndraw salaries from these two companies. 119I am prepared to accept that AML was paid, not so much for her abilities but \nbecause she was the wife of HAL. However, there was insufficient evidence before \nme to say how much should be attributed solely to her efforts and how much to \nher status as HAL’s wife. While AML was overpaid, this is different from saying \nthat she was paid for doing nothing. It appears that she did put in additional \neffort to do what she could, even if that was not enough. 120InYap Ami, there was no suggestion that any of the dependants had done \nanything to earn the amount paid by the business after the deceased’s death. InJung, the plaintiff did not pursue a claim for what the deceased had been \npaid and so it is of limited persuasive weight. 121Ultimately, AML had to take on certain roles in LP and MDI which she would not \nhave had to if HAL had not been killed. 122Mr Loh further argued that from 1997 onwards, AML’s salary began to dwindle \nbecause of the eventual collapse of MDI as well as LP. For LP, it had a negative \nvalue as at HAL’s death. Accordingly, Mr Loh submitted that even if HAL had \nbeen alive, the financial support he had been providing would have been \nsimilarly reduced. 123In my view, this argument assumes that HAL would not have been able to turn \nthings around and that he would not have been able to engage in other deals \nwhich would have been profitable. I am not prepared to make that \nassumption. 124In the circumstances, I am of the same view as the AR that AML is entitled to \nclaim for loss of support and there is to be no deduction either for interest on \ncapital inherited or for the amounts she earned from LP and MDI after HAL’s \ndeath. I come now to the multiplicand for loss of support.",
        "Multiplicand": "125Paragraph 4(c) of the Statement of Claim asserts that HAL gave a total of \n$250,000 as financial support for AML and her four daughters. Yet, in \npara 22(e) of AML’s first AEIC, she alleged that at the time of HAL’s \ndeath, he was providing approximately $160,000 per year either by direct \npayments to her or in kind for her daughters and herself. Then, in para 28 \nof the same affidavit, AML said she had various needs for support which HAL \nwould have provided and she listed out various items totalling $294,199 per \nyear. Subsequently, in the Opening Statement for AML for the assessment, her \nclaim for loss of support was reduced to $198,516 per year. 126Mr Siva Murugaiyan, who was AML’s other counsel, sought to explain the \ndiscrepancy between the figures of $160,000 per year and $198,516 per year in \nparas 5 to 6 of his written submission as follows: 5.In \nparagraph 22(e) of the Plaintiff’s affidavit, she has put forward a sum of \nUS$160,000.00. The difference[s] between this sum and the present sum of \nUS$198,516.00 are essentially as follows. (a)As regards \nclothing and food, the $160,000.00 per year claim includes $15,600.00 per year \nfor “food, clothing and incidentals”. The present claim separates food \n($11,511.00) and clothing ($15,000.00). The difference of $10,911.00 per year \nrelates primarily to the portion for food. (b)The \n$160,000.00 only included a sum of $3,600.00 for transport which only took into \naccount a monthly charge of $300.00. Whereas the present claim for \ntransportation is for $15,386.00 per annum which includes other costs of running \na car including purchase, insurance and maintenance. This accounts for a \ndifference of $11,786.00. (c)The \n$160,000.00 claim did not include any medical expenses. The present claim \nincludes medical expenses of $3,059.00. (d)The \n$160,000.00 per year amount did not include health insurance. The present claim \nincludes health insurance of $2,370.00. (e)The \n$160,000.00 per year claim did not include entertainment. The present updated \nclaim includes $4,598.00 for entertainment. Paragraph 22 overlooked any \nexpenses for entertainment, though HAL provided entertainment, usually by cash \noutlays. (f)The \n$160,000.00 sum also did not include miscellaneous incidentals which would \ninevitably be incurred in the normal course of life. The present claim for \n$198,516.00 includes a sum of $3,892.00. 6.The \nabove sums add up to $36,616.00 which is approximately the difference between \nthe present claim of $198,516.00 and the $160,000.00 claim put forward in \nparagraph 22. 127However, this submission did not explain how AML had come to make the alleged \nerrors in the first place or why four sets of figures had been advanced for loss \nof support for AML and her daughters. 128Mr Murugaiyan also submitted that AML’s evidence (presumably he meant her \nevidence for the sum of $198,516) was supported by the evidence of Herman \nKooymans who was the accountant of HAL personally as well as for LP and other \naffiliated companies since 1987. 129Paragraph 11 of Mr Kooymans’ first affidavit stated various amounts of \nmoney which HAL paid to AML or for her benefit. However, the amounts included \nsalaries drawn by AML from LP. A breakdown of Mr Kooymans’ figures can be found \nin a report prepared by Mr Foong Daw Ching, an expert witness for the \nDriver. Mr Foong is a certified public accountant and a partner of \nM/s TeoFoongWongLCLoong. The breakdown is as follows: Gross paymentto or for \n    AMLSalary to AMLAML from \n    LPNet amount providedby HAL to or for \n      AMLUS$US$US$199188,458.7236,000.0052,458.721992199,689.2537,800.00161,889.251993179,437.8239,720.00139,717.821994 (1 Janto \n      8 May57,810.2613,800.0044,010.26525,396.05127,320.00398,076.05 130So, even if the salary to AML were to be included and assuming Mr Kooymans’ \nfigures above are correct, they would still show an annual figure of less than \n$160,000 per year,ie$525,396.05 ÷ 40 months x 12 months = $157,618.82 \nper year, and not $198,516 per year. 131Paragraph 5.2.6 of Mr Foong’s report states that based on a review of \nthe cheques exhibited in Mr Kooymans’ first affidavit, the total payment by \nHAL to AML for the same 40-month period does not exceed $326,011.49. This works \nout to less than $98,000 per year. Yet in para 6.2.3 of Mr Foong’s \nreport where he commented on AML’s estimation of $160,000 per year, \nMr Foong estimated the annual support to AML to be $130,000 per year at \nmost, after deducting schooling expenses for the daughters. The AR had adopted \nthis $130,000 as the multiplicand. 132Mr Kooymans had criticised Mr Foong’s estimation of $130,000 per year \nbecause AML had not included her daughter’s education expenses in \npara 22(e) of her first AEIC when she mentioned the figure of $160,000 per \nyear. I note that while AML did not mention the daughter’s education expenses as \npart of the $160,000 figure, she did indicate that the $160,000 was to support \nher daughters and herself. In any event, Mr Foong had made his own checks \nand calculations from the documentary evidence supplied to support AML’s \nclaim. 133Mr Loh submitted that AML’s salary from LP before HAL’s death should not be \ntaken into account as loss of support, citingBurgess v Management Committee \nof the Florence Nightingale Hospital for Gentlewomen[1955] \n1 All ER 511 (“Burgess”). In that case, the widower was suing \nfor his loss of dependency as a result of the death of his wife. They were \nprofessional dancers and it was his contention that his income had been affected \nas he could no longer have his wife as his dance partner. It was held in that \ncase (as set out in the headnote of the report) that: [D]amages for injury to a husband \nresulting from the death of a wife were only recoverable under the Fatal \nAccidents Act, 1846, s 2, if they were attributable to the relationship of \nhusband and wife, and as no benefit arose from the dancing partnership of the \nplaintiff and his wife which could properly be attributed to their relationship \nas husband and wife, no damages were recoverable for the value of the wife to \nthe plaintiff as his dance partner. 134I am of the view thatBurgessis not applicable to the facts before me. \nThe salary which was paid to AML before HAL’s death was not because of her \nbusiness relationship with HAL but because of their relationship as husband and \nwife. It was HAL’s way,quahusband, of providing AML with some financial \nsupport and apparently she did no work or little work to earn that \nsalary. 135Mr Loh also submitted that Mr Foong’s figure of $130,000 per year did not \ntake into account other expenses of the daughter although the Opening Statement \nfor the Driver had urged that Mr Foong’s figures be adopted. It seems to be \nfrom Mr Foong’s summary worksheet that the expenses of the daughters, other \nthan the educational expenses, were minor and I am not inclined to make a \ndeduction for other expenses for the daughters. 136Mr Loh further submitted that AML had exercised her option to purchase the \nEmerald Drive property on 28 December 1995 and had reduced her outlay on \nthe mortgage of her house from $7,587.67 a month to $5,646.06 a month, a \nreduction of more than 25% or $23,299.08 per year. He submitted this should be \ntaken into account as well. However, Mr Loh’s reference to p 29 of \nAML’s first AEIC to support this factual assertion is not borne out by the said \np 29. 137In the circumstances, I am of the view that the multiplicand should remain as \n$130,000 per year.",
        "Multiplier": "138After considering the range of multipliers in a number of local cases, HAL’s \nhealth, his hardworking habits and the nature of his work, the AR adopted a \nmultiplier of eight years. 139Mr Murugaiyan had sought 16 years before the AR. Before me, he sought 14 to \n16, alternatively 12 or 13 and, then, at least 10 to 12 years. 140Mr Murugaiyan relied on a judgment of Judith Prakash J inLim Fook \nLau v Kepdrill International Incorporated SA[1993] 1 SLR 917where he claimed that the judge had said that it was not unusual for \nprofessionals or businessmen to work to their late 60s or even their 70s. That \nwas not an accurate representation of what Prakash J said. What the judge \nsaid, at 921, [9], was that the deceased doctor, who died when she was nearly 30 \nyears old, “could probably have worked till her late 60s”. Prakash J then \ntook the view that the deceased would therefore have a further working life of \nbetween 30 to 35 years but for the accident. 141Be that as it may, I accept that in view of HAL’s good health and working habits \nas well as his very ambitious character, it was likely that he would have worked \nto 70 years old. He was killed when he was 48 years old and AML was also 48 \nyears old then. Having considered the same range of multipliers as the AR did, I \nam of the view that a multiplier of ten years is fair. 142As I said inTan Harry, the multiplier is to be calculated from the date \nof HAL’s death.",
        "Claim for professional \nfees": "143After HAL’s death, the only will that was discovered was one made by him in 1970 \nwhich did not take into account subsequent changes in the law which would have \nenabled HAL to devise all his assets to AML without taxes. As a result, the US \ngovernment assessed HAL’s estate taxes to be about $14m plus interest which \namounted to a total of about $20m. AML disputed the assessment on the grounds \nthat prior to HAL’s departure to Singapore and his death, HAL had evinced an \nintention to update his estate planning and execute a new will to take into \naccount changes in the law. Consequently, lawyers’ fees, valuers’ fees, \naccountants’ fees and other related expenses were incurred to dispute the US \ngovernment’s assessment. The amount incurred was said to be $1,269,422.33, \nalthough the pleadings claimed a total of $984,971 only for such expenses. The \nUS Tax Court ruled in favour of the estate on 19 October 2000 that no taxes were \npayable. Mr Hwang submitted that had the US Tax Court not ruled \naccordingly, the $20m tax would have been a separate head of claim under the \nprinciple inDavies v Whiteways Cyder Co Ltd[1975] QB 262 \n(“Davies”). Accordingly, he submitted that AML should be entitled to \nclaim the professional fees incurred to avoid such taxes. 144InDavies, the deceased had made gifts of property and money to his wife \nand son. Within seven years of the gifts, he was killed in an accident. \nAccordingly, the value of the gifts was taken into account for the purpose of \nestate duty and an additional sum became payable as estate duty. The widow and \nson claimed,inter alia, the additional estate duty against the owners \nand driver of the lorry which had collided with the deceased’s car. \nO’Connor J allowed this claim. 145Mr Loh submitted thatDaviesis distinguishable on the facts. There \nthe gifts had already accrued to the dependants. Mr Loh submitted thatDaviesis not authority for the proposition that a dependant can claim \nfor post-mortem estate planning. The AR decided that AML’s claim for the \nprofessional fees did not fall within a dependency claim as it was an estate \nclaim. 146I am also of the view that such a claim is an estate claim and not a dependency \nclaim. Therefore, I will not allow it. 147The tax initially imposed was for the account of the estate and the expenses \nincurred to avoid the tax was for the benefit of the estate. Any benefit which \nAML would have derived from HAL’s estate would have beenquabeneficiary \nof the estate and notquadependant.",
        "Claim for US$85,000 for \npost-trial non-recurring expenses for the weddings of Christy and Cheryl \nLassiter": "148In Mr Hwang’s summary of reliefs claimed, there is an item of $85,000 for \npost-trial non-recurring expenses for the weddings of Christy and Cheryl \nLassiter. The AR had awarded $60,000 for such expenses. As AML’s appeal had been \nconfined to a claim for herself as dependant, it is not open for AML to claim \nfor an increase for such expenses. Secondly, this claim was not even pleaded. \nThirdly, no reason was given to show that the AR’s decision on this claim was \nwrong. Therefore, I will not increase the aforesaid wedding expenses to \n$85,000.",
        "Summary": "149In summary, the Driver’s appeal in respect of loss of support is \ndismissed. 150I allow AML’s appeal in part in that I will vary the multiplier for the loss of \nsupport for AML from eight years to ten years. The rest of her appeal is \ndismissed. 151I will hear the parties on costs of the appeals and the assessment below and on \nany other consequential orders that may be required. Defendant’s appeal dismissed and \nplaintiff’s appeal allowed in part."
