        "THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE": "6 The first three witnesses of the\n\nPlaintiff were Cambodians. They were part of an Investigation Committee formed to look\n\ninto the death of the accused. The Plaintiff did not manage to file their affidavits of\n\nevidence-in-chief and they therefore testified orally. All three gentlemen spoke in the\n\nKhmer language.7 Hun Sothy has been a police officer in\n\nCambodia for about 17 years. His duties and training included going to study the scenes of\n\ncrime and to analyse any bodies found. He explained that an Investigation Committee\n\ncomprising representatives from various government departments would be established\n\nwhenever there was a case involving the death of a foreign national.8 On 2 June 1997, he received a report\n\nfrom the police sometime after 1 pm that a man had died in Room 505 of the Pailin Hotel.\n\nHe ordered the room to be sealed.9 When he arrived at the hotel at about 2\n\npm, some members of the Investigation Committee were there. They waited for the rest to\n\narrive before entering the hotel room.10 He interviewed Lim Chok Young, a\n\nchambermaid of the hotel and an employee from the photography shop near the hotel. The\n\ntiming of the incident as told by the latter two was consistent with that narrated by Lim\n\nChok Young. The Investigation Committee examined the bedroom and the bathroom and found\n\nnothing unusual. There was nothing present at the scene that could have been used as a\n\nweapon. There was no sign of forced entry or of struggle. The floor in the bathroom was\n\nslippery because it was wet. The water level in the bath tub was very low because the\n\nwater had been flowing slowly into the drainage hole. There was no blood stain in the\n\nbedroom or in the bathroom.11 The deceased’s body (now clothed)\n\nhad been placed on the bed earlier. It was moved by the Investigation Committee to the\n\nfloor. They examined the body and found a scratch mark on the left cheek measuring 1 cm\n\nlong and 0.5 cm wide. There was no blood seen at the scratch. Another similar scratch mark\n\nwas found on the right arm of the deceased near the wrist.12 Based on all the above, the\n\nInvestigation Committee concluded that the deceased had died from drowning. The\n\ninvestigations concluded at about 5 pm that day.13 The translated report of the\n\nInvestigation Committee stated as follows:\"KINGDOM OF CAMBODIANATION RELIGION KINGPhnom Penh Municipal PolicePolice Technical and Criminal OfficeNo. 088/97 S.N.RPhnom Penh, 02 June 1997At 13h30, received from Mr. Houy Song,\n\n  Chief of Criminal Section, 7 Makara District, reported that a dead man, which happened at\n\n  12h15, on 02 June 1997, in the room 505, Pailin Hotel, Preach Monivong Street, Sangkat\n\n  Orussei IV, 7 Makara District.Composition of the Committees are:- Mr Prach Nhat, Occupation : Chief- Mr. Chim Panna + Mr. Sann Sopat + Mr. Try Sovannara- Mr. Houy Song, Chief of Criminal Section, 7 Makara District- Mr. So Vandy, Deputy Chief of Immigration Section- Mr. Sou Sara, Chief of Police Section, Orussei IV- Mr. Lek Se, Forensic medical doctor of Phnom Penh city- Mr. Thoung Ramy, Representative of Procurator of Phnom Penh City.The Witness:- Mr. Lim Chok Young, Nephew of the deadThe Committees started to examine at\n\n  14h00, on 02 June 1997.- The weather is fine with sun shine- The accident place : changedThe Committees examine the place:In the room 505, Pailin Hotel, Preach\n\n  Monivong Street, Sangkat Orussei IV, 7 Makara District.The view around the room:I.

After read the note, the above Committees signed as follow :ParticipantsResponsible examineReporterMr. Houy SongMr. Prach NhatMr. Chim PannaMr. So VandyMr. Sou SaraWitnessMr. Lek SeMr. Lim Chok YoungMr. Thoung Ramy.\"14 Although the above report did not state\n\nwhat the Committee’s findings were, Hun Sothy explained that they found no foul play\n\nand concluded that the deceased had slipped, fallen into the bath tub and drowned. They\n\nleft the report containing the Committee’s conclusions to the medical specialist, Dr\n\nLek Se.15 Under cross-examination, Hun Sothy said\n\nthat Lim Chok Young did tell them that he had tried to resuscitate the deceased after he\n\nwas removed from the bath tub but could not recall what exactly Lim Chok Young had said.\n\nAsked how the deceased could have ended up lying face down in the bath tub, he replied\n\nthat it all depended on whether the deceased fell into the bath tub face up or face down.\n\nThe Committee was informed that the deceased was naked and lying face down in the water.\n\nHe could not recall whether Lim Chok Young said anything about the position of the\n\ndeceased’s right arm when he was found in the bath tub.16 Hun Sothy emphasized that the\n\nCommittee’s conclusion was a collective one made after all the individual members,\n\nwho were specialists in their own field, had expressed their opinion. They felt that the\n\nscratch marks on the deceased’s left cheek could have been caused by him falling and\n\nscratching against a hard object, which could have been the bath tub, the tap or the wall.\n\nIt was most likely the bath tub as the deceased could have fallen on a hard object with a\n\nsmooth surface. He did not think the scratch marks on the cheek were indicative of a\n\ndefensive injury which would be larger. Further, if there was an attacker, there should\n\nalso be injuries on the deceased’s head and chest. They did not think it appropriate\n\nto ask Lim Chok Young about the injury on the deceased’s cheek as it was the\n\nCommittee’s task to investigate. They also did not examine Lim Chok Young’s\n\nbody.17 As for the deceased’s legs, if the\n\nlower portion of his body did not hit against anything hard, there would be no injuries\n\nthere.18 Hun Sothy explained that his opinions\n\nwere based on his 17 years of experience as a police office during which he examined about\n\n200 dead bodies annually. Although this was the only bath tub drowning case that he had\n\ninvestigated, he had experience with more than 40 cases of drowning. Lim Chok Young did\n\nnot pay any money to the Investigation Committee.19 The Chairman of the Investigation\n\nCommittee was Prach Nhat, the Chief of the Technical and Scientific Bureau of the\n\nMunicipal Police, whose duties included the identification of thumbprints and of documents\n\nand the examination of scenes of crime. According to him, the Committee concluded that the\n\ndeath was by drowning from the information given that the deceased was weak and had\n\ntravelled a lot, from the condition of the bathroom and the other information gleaned from\n\nthe interviews with Lim Chok Young and the two chambermaids of the hotel. Although the\n\nconclusions of the Committee were not in their report proper, the Medical Expertise Report\n\ndated 3 June 1997 by Dr Lek Se, another member of the Investigation Committee, formed part\n\nof the Committee’s report. The Medical Expertise Report stated:\"Medical Expertise Report- At the request of technical and\n\n  scientific police unit of the Ministry of Interior.- Following the instruction of the\n\n  director of Phnom Penh Municipal Health Directorate,On Monday, 2ndJune 1997 at 16\n\n  h00mn in room No. 505, on fourth floor of Pailin hotel,We, Dr. Lek Se, a surgeon of Phnom Penh\n\n  hospital and forensic medical doctor, accompanied by Mr. Yim Chan in charge of Phnom Penh\n\n  municipal sanitation, Mr. Prach Nhat, Chief of scientific and technical bureau, Mr. Hun\n\n  Sothy, deputy chief of technical and scientific bureau, examined the body of Lim Mah Chan,\n\n  sex: male, born in 1936, race: Singaporean, home address: Singapore, passport No. 5078984,\n\n  entry visa dated 30 May 1997.a) Circumstances surrounding the dead:- According to the nephew named Lim Chok\n\n  Yung, sex: male, born: in 1955, race: Singaporean, who traveled with him on tourist tour,\n\n  on 2ndJune 1997 at 12h 15 minutes, Mr. Lim Mah Chan went to the bath room, but\n\n  Mr. Lim Chok Yung himself came down to pick up the photo on ground floor for about\n\n  20minutes. When returned to the room, he didn’t see his uncle in the room, and being\n\n  alarmed, he pushed the door of the bathroom open. At that time he saw Mr. Lim Mah Chan in\n\n  the bath tub full of water. He shouted to Sreng Sokhim, sex: female, age: 23, race: Khmer\n\n  and Yem Sophea, sex: female, age: 20, race: Khmer, occupation: room cleaners in the hotel,\n\n  for helping him to carry his uncle out of the bath tub and to give first aid to his uncle.\n\n  But the effort failed to render any result, since the victim had already passed away.- Before his death, Mr. Lim Mah Chan did\n\n  not have any appetite for the food.- The hotel employees noticed that the\n\n  victim looked very tired and pale.b) The body examination:- The body was naked, lying face up.\n\n  There was some water coming out from his mouth as we pressed his abdomen. Nothing else was\n\n  noticed.Conclusion:- Based on the account given by Mr.\n\n  Lim Chok Young, the victim’s nephew.- Based on the account provided of the\n\n  hotel employees.- According to the actual examination of\n\n  the body.We make a conclusion that Mr. Lim Mah Chan\n\n  was really dead of fainting spell and drowning in the bath tub.Phnom Penh, 3rdJune 1997forensic medical doctor\"singed\"Seen and approvedPhnom Penh, 5thJune 1997Director of Phnom Penh Municipal Health\n\n  DirectorateDr. Suor Salorn\"signed and sealed\" Dr. Lek\n\n  Se\"20 Prach Nhat also emphasized that the\n\nviews of the Committee were reached after discussions and were consensual. The Committee\n\ndid not receive any payment from Lim Chok Young. He remembered Lim Chok Young telling them\n\nthat the deceased was found face down in the bath tub and that one leg was at the top of\n\nthe bath tub. He could not recall what Lim Chok Young said about the other leg.21 The final Cambodian witness was Dr Lek\n\nSe, Chief of Surgeon, Gynaecology Unit and Forensic Pathology in Phnom Penh University\n\nHospital since 1988. He has investigated more than 50 cases of victims who died in water.\n\nUnfortunately, Cambodia did not have the facilities for full autopsies. If there was a\n\nbullet wound, he would do a partial autopsy on the relevant part of the body. Due to this\n\nlack of facilities, the Committee investigating a cause of death would have to consider\n\nall aspects of the case, e.g. information from people who were living with the deceased,\n\nthe presence of any unusual objects and an examination of the dead body. If there were\n\nsuspicious circumstances, the Committee would inform the higher authorities. The forensic\n\npathologist would work closely with the police in conducting investigations.22 When the Committee arrived at the hotel\n\nroom, the deceased had been placed on a bed and had a t-shirt and a pair of shorts on. The\n\nbody was still a little wet. They interviewed Lim Chok Young about the medical history of\n\nthe deceased and then checked the deceased’s belongings to verify his statements as\n\nthey \"did not believe 100% the statement of Lim Chok Young\". Lim Chok Young told\n\nhim that the deceased had no previous health problems but was tired and had no appetite\n\nafter his arrival in Cambodia. That was consistent with what the hotel’s staff had\n\nseen. The Committee found no drug prescriptions, drugs or sleeping pills and saw no sign\n\nof forced entry or of struggle in the room.23 Lim Chok Young also told Dr Lek Se that\n\nthe deceased had fallen into the water, that his head was inside the water while his\n\nbuttocks were above the water, that one leg was inside the tub while the other was\n\noutside. That was again corroborated by the two chambermaids. When the naked body was\n\ntaken out from the bath tub, clothes were put on it to protect the modesty of the two\n\nchambermaids. They had tried to revive the deceased by moving his arms and legs up and\n\ndown.24 The Committee then carried the deceased\n\nfrom the bed to the floor of the bedroom and removed his clothes. They then examined the\n\nbody, noted the minor scratches on the face and the wrist and took black and white\n\nphotographs thereof. There was no blood, no blackness and no swelling at the scratch\n\nmarks. They were however recent injuries. They were not sure what could have caused the\n\nscratches, although they could not have been the result of physical blows as there were no\n\nbruises or fractures. Water emerged from the deceased’s mouth and nose when the\n\nabdomen was pressed. His private parts did not show the presence of sperm and his anus did\n\nnot have unusual stool. Dr Lek Se stressed that the physical examination lasted more than\n\nan hour and was a very careful one.25 After considering all the physical and\n\noral evidence, the Committee concluded that death was a result of syncope (or a fainting\n\nspell) and then drowning in the bath tub. This was because there was water in the lungs\n\nand in the stomach. They opined the deceased had syncope because he was a foreigner who\n\nhad travelled a lot and the temperature was very hot in Cambodia. Further, the deceased\n\nhad been seen by the hotel’s staff to be very weak and Lim Chok Young had said that\n\nhe had very poor appetite and the drowning was just before lunch time. While knocking the\n\nhead onto something or falling into water could revive a fainting man, the deceased was\n\nweak and his head was in the water. In the Committee’s view, drowning was the sole\n\ncause of death.26 Dr Lek Se agreed that in theory, an\n\nautopsy should have been done but said that was not possible in the circumstances. The\n\nCommittee had done their duty in the best possible way in the situation. If foul play was\n\nsuspected, the Public Prosecutor, a member of the Committee, would be informed\n\naccordingly. Further, if an autopsy was deemed necessary, information would be given to\n\nthe Courts which could approach the relevant embassy to have the body repatriated to the\n\ncountry of origin for a full autopsy to be conducted. In this case, there was no suspicion\n\nof foul play and neither did Dr Lek Se consider an autopsy necessary. It would have taken\n\na long process to repatriate the body in any event and the effectiveness of an autopsy\n\nwould be affected by the lapse of time.27 It was difficult to exclude the\n\npossibility that the deceased might have been drugged but the Committee did not suspect\n\nthat. Where there was no suspicion of foul play, the body would be released to the\n\nnext-of-kin. However, about six to eight hours after the occurrence of death, the body\n\nwould be checked again in case there were signs of change. Dr Lek Se did inspect the body\n\nagain at about 7 pm that same day at the temple where cremation was to take place and he\n\nsaw no unusual signs.28 Under cross-examination, Dr Lek Se said\n\nhe had performed about 20 to 30 cases of partial, localized autopsy but never a complete\n\nautopsy. He agreed that it was incorrect to say the cause of death was drowning merely\n\nbecause water came out of a corpse’s mouth when the stomach was pressed but added\n\nthat the other circumstances, in this case, the witnesses’ statements, were taken\n\ninto account as well. He also added that the Medical Expertise Report prepared by him was\n\nnot a detailed report but was a \"summary report\".29 Dr Lek Se opined that it was not\n\npossible to sustain the scratch marks on the left cheek if the deceased was standing\n\noutside the bath tub when he fell. It was possible if he were standing inside the bath tub\n\nwhen he fell. He did not think the light impact that caused the scratches could have\n\nrendered the deceased unconscious. He opined that the deceased fell into the water, tried\n\nto get up but could not and hence drowned.30 Insofar as the light scratch on the\n\nright wrist was concerned, Dr Lek Se said it could have been caused when the deceased\n\nstruggled to get up. Asked how the injury could have been caused if the right arm was at\n\nthe back of the deceased’s body, he replied that he did not know what the deceased\n\nwas doing prior to putting his hand at his back. He did not agree that the deceased could\n\nhave been held in an arm-lock and then forced into the water.31 Asked whether it was a medical fact\n\nthat when injury was inflicted, the bruise might only show up after one full day, Dr Lek\n\nSe said he would estimate it as a couple of hours and agreed that it depended on the size\n\nand the depth of the bruise.32 Dr Lek Se estimated that the body was\n\nin the water for some 15 to 20 minutes. The Committee excluded the possibility of drug\n\noverdose or of poisoning through their examination of the scene of the incident which\n\nshowed no sign of any drugs. They also detected no unusual smell from the body and he saw\n\nno chemical change in the body later that evening. This was the procedure that obtained in\n\nCambodia although he agreed that in theory, a post-mortem toxicology analysis would have\n\nbeen necessary in order to exclude medically the possibility of drug overdose or of\n\npoisoning. They could have been drawn a sample of the deceased’s blood or urine but\n\nthe difficult part was to get it analysed.33 In re-examination, Dr Lek Se went on to\n\nexplain why he did not think that the deceased had been held in an arm-lock and then\n\nforced into the water. That was because there were no signs of any struggle and neither\n\nwere there any hair loss or bruises. If the deceased had died before immersion, he could\n\nnot have water in the stomach and the lungs.34 The Committee’s consensus was that\n\nthe deceased was standing near the bath tub or with one leg inside the bath tub, which was\n\nslippery, when he had syncope and fell into the water. Due to his poor health and the long\n\ntravel, he could not get out of the water and he therefore drowned. The tap or the edge of\n\nthe bath tub could have caused the scratch marks found on his body.35 Asked by the Court whether he would\n\nhave done anything differently if he had been told that the deceased had taken out about\n\nUS$450,000 in insurance policies, that his nephew had helped procure those policies, that\n\nthe beneficiary was the ex-wife of the nephew and they were then living together again, Dr\n\nLek Se replied that they would look further but would have the same conclusion.36 The Defendants’ expert, Dr Gilbert\n\nLau, Director of Forensic Pathology in the Department of Forensic Medicine, was the next\n\nwitness to testify although the Plaintiff had not closed her case. I shall deal with his\n\ntestimony when I narrate the Defendants’ case.",
        "THE DEFENDANTS’ NOTICE FOR FURTHER\n\nDIRECTIONS": "37 On the morning of the third day of the\n\ntrial, there was a small measure of drama. The Defendants applied by way of Notice for\n\nFurther Directions for liberty to re-amend their Defence at paragraph 15 (b) thereof to\n\ninclude an averment that they require the Plaintiff to prove the alleged relationship of\n\nLim Chok Young to the deceased and for leave to call a further witness.38 Lek Siang Pheng, Counsel for the\n\nDefendants, in his affidavit filed on 19 July 2000, said that on the morning of 18 July\n\n2000, he received a telephone call in his office from one Tan Yong Chong who informed him\n\nthat he was calling on behalf of a relative of the deceased who could not speak English.\n\nWhen Lek told the caller that he was able to converse in Mandarin, the caller told him to\n\ncontact one Sim Chye Huat.39 Lek then spoke to Sim Chye Huat who\n\nclaimed to be the brother of the sister-in-law of the deceased. He said that he had seen\n\nthe photograph of the deceased published in The New Paper on 15 July 2000 and in the\n\nChinese press on 17 July 2000. He alleged that the deceased did not have a nephew named\n\nLim Chok Young and that the deceased’s family was shocked to learn of his death and\n\nthat someone was passing himself off as the nephew. Sim then faxed to Lek’s office a\n\ncopy of an obituary dated 24 January 1992 as well as a photograph of the deceased when he\n\nwas alive and attending Sim’s wedding. He said that the deceased had a brother and a\n\nsister and the obituary was that of the wife of the deceased’s late brother.40 Lek went on to state that he had given\n\na copy of the said obituary and the photograph to Counsel for the Plaintiff when the Court\n\nadjourned for lunch on 18 July 2000.41 The Defendants’ representative who\n\nwent to interview Sim found out that the deceased’s brother had passed away in 1998\n\nbut his adopted sister Lim Kim Poh was still alive and would be willing to testify in\n\nCourt. The Defendants therefore applied for leave to call Lim Kim Poh as an additional\n\nwitness. Sim Chye Huat was subsequently also called as a witness.42 The Plaintiff had no objections to the\n\napplication but responded by asking for leave to call three more witnesses – the\n\nmother, the brother and the adopted sister of Lim Chok Young – to testify that while\n\nLim Chok Young was not a blood relative of the deceased, his father was the\n\ndeceased’s \"sworn brother\".43 I granted the Defendants’\n\napplication and the Plaintiff’s consequential application.",
        "THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE (CONTINUED)": "44 The Plaintiff, a sales promoter drawing\n\na basic monthly salary of $1,000 is the executrix and beneficiary of the estate of the\n\ndeceased by virtue of a will made on 22 February 1997. She claimed to be related to the\n\ndeceased through her former husband, Lim Chok Young, as the deceased was his uncle.45 The Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young were\n\nliving in a three-room HDB flat in Hougang (\"the Hougang flat\") until after\n\ntheir divorce in 1994 when she transferred her share in the Hougang flat to Lim Chok\n\nYoung. In 1995, the Plaintiff purchased a new five-room HDB flat in Woodlands (\"the\n\nWoodlands flat\").46 The deceased started visiting the\n\nPlaintiff and Lim Chok Young at the Hougang flat more than ten years ago. Lim Chok Young\n\ninvited him to stay with them after learning that he was not happy staying with his\n\nfriends. The Plaintiff did not object as she found the deceased to be a simple,\n\nundemanding and quiet man with smoking as his only vice.47 After the deceased moved into the\n\nHougang flat, the Plaintiff helped him with his laundry and cooked for him. About seven or\n\neight years ago, he told the couple that he had received advice from a Taoist deity to\n\n\"adopt\" a god-child and asked the Plaintiff if she would like to be his\n\ngod-child. Upon her consent, a simple tea ceremony was held to solemnize the relationship.48 After their divorce in 1994, the\n\nPlaintiff and Lim Chok Young stayed in contact with each other as they had a daughter (now\n\n14 years old) whom they both loved. Lim Chok Young would go to visit the daughter\n\nregularly.49 In November 1996, the divorced couple\n\nconverted to Christianity and attended instruction classes together at the St\n\nAndrew’s Cathedral. Their relationship improved and Lim Chok Young visited the\n\nPlaintiff and their child more frequently at the Woodlands flat and stayed overnight there\n\noccasionally. In 1998, Lim Chok Young, who had purchased a three-room HDB flat in Yishun\n\n(\"the Yishun flat\") after the divorce, sold the Yishun flat and moved in with\n\nthe Plaintiff and their daughter. They were happy to be reunited as a family.50 The deceased would visit the Woodlands\n\nflat with Lim Chok Young or by himself. He would also stay overnight there occasionally.\n\nThe deceased had bought a three-room HDB flat at Petir Road (\"the Petir Road\n\nflat\") through the financial assistance of Lim Chok Young.51 The Plaintiff was aware that Lim Chok\n\nYoung and the deceased had travelled to Thailand and to Malaysia for holidays. She had\n\nnever travelled with the deceased but had gone on holiday with Lim Chok Young to China in\n\n1995 and to the USA and South Korea in 1996.52 The Plaintiff was not aware of the\n\ntravel insurance policies that the deceased had taken out for his trips and was also\n\nignorant of the fact that the deceased had made a will and named her as the sole\n\nbeneficiary. She discovered all these only after his death in Cambodia. The will dated 22\n\nFebruary 1997 appointed her as the sole executrix and trustee and devised and bequeathed\n\nthe Petir Road flat and all of the deceased’s properties to the Plaintiff.53 In 1997, Lim Chok Young telephoned the\n\nPlaintiff one night from Phnom Penh to tell her that the deceased had died in an accident.\n\nShe was very surprised and shocked. She knew that the deceased was fine before he left for\n\nthe tour with Lim Chok Young and that he had never complained about any major illness. Lim\n\nChok Young asked her whether they should bring the deceased’s body back to Singapore.\n\nWhen she learned that it would be very costly to do so, she agreed with Lim Chok Young\n\nthat the deceased be cremated in Phnom Penh and his ashes be brought home.54 Subsequently, Lim Chok Young brought\n\nthe deceased’s ashes to Singapore and placed his remains at the Mandai Columbarium.\n\nLim Chok Young did some prayers there. However, the Plaintiff was not there as she was\n\nvery busy working. There was no funeral or announcement of the death through an obituary.55 Later, Lim Chok Young informed the\n\nPlaintiff about the travel insurance policies and she asked him to help her notify the\n\ninsurance companies in question.56 The Plaintiff went on to state that she\n\ncould not understand why the Defendants were refusing to pay on the policies when the\n\nCambodian authorities had already certified that the deceased drowned in the bath tub. She\n\nwas very surprised that the Defendants were alleging criminal conduct on the part of Lim\n\nChok Young and that she was part of the conspiracy to murder the deceased for the\n\ninsurance monies. Lim Chok Young was very close to the deceased and she did not believe\n\nthat \"he would want to cause his uncle’s death to gain from the travel insurance\n\npolicies\".57 In cross-examination, the Plaintiff\n\nsaid that the deceased started to visit them at the Hougang flat in 1988 and, since mid\n\n1988, started to bring along some of his belongings to the flat. The deceased told them he\n\nwas a general worker then. Lim Chok Young treated the deceased well and the deceased liked\n\nhim very much. She did not know whether the two men were related by blood but they were\n\n\"something like father and son\". Lim Chok Young only told her that the deceased\n\nwas his uncle or his father’s younger brother. She did not know about the\n\ndeceased’s siblings or anything about him being a sworn brother of Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s father until the second day of the trial.58 Asked whether stating that the deceased\n\nhad \"no other relative\" in a Statutory Declaration dated 11 June 1997 (AB 264)\n\nmeant that she had already known that the deceased and Lim Chok Young were not related,\n\nshe disagreed and stated that she did not know why Lim Chok Young, as the nephew of the\n\ndeceased, could not have sworn the Statutory Declaration himself. She meant that the\n\ndeceased was not married and had no offspring.59 Asked when her relationship with Lim\n\nChok Young became good again after their divorce, the Plaintiff said that it was after\n\nthey attended counselling sessions at the church and were baptised in November 1996.60 It was Lim Chok Young who came up with\n\nthe money for the deceased’s Petir Road flat. The deceased did live in that flat but\n\nshe was uncertain about the period. One of the two bedrooms there was rented out. The\n\ndeceased would still stay at the Plaintiff’s Woodlands flat every now and then. She\n\ndid not know who collected the rental but Lim Chok Young did give the deceased money for\n\nhis living expenses. She did not know why the Petir Road flat was given to her instead of\n\nLim Chok Young.61 Asked when Lim Chok Young started to\n\nlive with her in the Woodlands flat, her reply was, \"After our baptism in November\n\n1996, after he sold his Hougang flat, he came to stay with me\". She added that Lim\n\nChok Young had also stayed over at the Woodlands flat after their divorce and before their\n\nbaptism. The Plaintiff agreed that she, Lim Chok Young and their daughter had gone to\n\nSouth Korea on holiday together in November 1996, by which time she had regarded Lim Chok\n\nYoung as her husband again.62 Asked whether she agreed that the\n\ndeceased was not a person who would plan financially for his future, the Plaintiff said he\n\nwas like that previously until she suggested to him that he should keep some money for\n\nhimself by saving. The deceased listened and nodded and began to change a lot by taking\n\ncare of himself. The deceased was very happy when he was with the Plaintiff who cared so\n\nmuch that she would remove the bones from the fish she cooked for his meals before serving\n\nit to him.63 The Plaintiff also agreed that the\n\ndeceased had no regular source of income and when he had no money, he would often go\n\nhungry. He did not have any bank account and had no savings. He would always spend his\n\nmoney on cigarettes while buying rice and canned food occasionally. Occasionally, the\n\ndeceased won in 4-D lotteries and would buy and bring a lot of things home. He would also\n\nspeak to a female insurance agent who went to the Woodlands flat but the Plaintiff did not\n\nask him whether he bought any policies.64 The deceased was unemployed during the\n\nperiod before his demise. The Plaintiff did not know why he required so much insurance\n\ncoverage in April and May 1997, something she found strange. She was not aware that he had\n\nalso applied to AIA for three other policies in May 1997.65 Asked when she discovered the\n\ndeceased’s will, the Plaintiff explained that she and Lim Chok Young went to the\n\ndeceased’s Petir Road flat after his death and she found some documents inside a box\n\nwhich she showed to Lim Chok Young as she was not literate in English. Lim Chok Young then\n\ntold her that the deceased had bought insurance.66 When Lim Chok Young and the deceased\n\ntravelled together overseas, they did not tell her about the trips before they left. In\n\nfact, she did not even know that the two of them had gone to Cambodia until the telephone\n\ncall came from Lim Chok Young bringing news about the death which caused her to cry. She\n\ndid not even know where Cambodia was. Lim Chok Young asked her over the telephone to go to\n\nthe travel agency at Golden Mile to fax over a document stating that she was the\n\ndeceased’s relative. There was no discussion about any insurance policies.67 In re-examination, the Plaintiff said\n\nthat Lim Chok Young and the deceased would visit her daughter at the Woodlands flat\n\ntogether. Occasionally, the deceased would go to the flat by himself and would also stay\n\novernight. She had given them the keys to the Woodlands flat. She gave the keys to Lim\n\nChok Young because their daughter was still young and he said he would like to visit their\n\ndaughter. The Plaintiff had to work and could not afford a maid. Initially, she was not\n\nhappy about the two men’s visits as she and Lim Chok Young had already gone through\n\nthe divorce. However, she permitted them to visit because of her daughter.68 Although probate of the deceased’s\n\nestate was granted to the Plaintiff, it was Lim Chok Young who was administering the\n\nestate.69 She reiterated that she was very upset\n\nby the allegations of criminal conduct and by the publicity in the press concerning this\n\ncase. She maintained that she had cared for the deceased and was happy with her life,\n\ngiving hardly any thought to money. Even if she hated someone, she would not go to the\n\nextent of killing him.70 In reply to my questions, the Plaintiff\n\nexplained that after the divorce in 1994, she continued to live at the Hougang flat for\n\nabout a year or so because her daughter was schooling in the vicinity. She and Lim Chok\n\nYoung had applied for a five-room Woodlands flat from the HDB some time back and she took\n\nover this flat after the divorce. She obtained possession of the Woodlands flat sometime\n\nabout 1996. The matrimonial home – the Hougang flat – was sold at the end of\n\n1995 for $130,000 and she got back her CPF contributions, together with interest, paid for\n\nthat flat. The Woodlands flat cost $130,000. It was purchased direct from the HDB and the\n\ninstalment payments were currently being serviced through her CPF account.71 The Plaintiff also said that after the\n\nHougang flat was sold, Lim Chok Young moved to the Woodlands flat and agreed that after\n\ntheir divorce, both never ceased to stay together. When questioned about Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s ownership of the Yishun flat, she replied that he bought that three-room flat\n\nbecause he wanted to earn extra income from renting out one of the two bedrooms. She then\n\nadded that Lim Chok Young lived at two places – sometimes at the Woodlands flat and\n\nsometimes at the Yishun flat . When they quarrelled, Lim Chok Young would stay at the\n\nYishun flat. She then added further that she and Lim Chok Young would stay sometimes at\n\nthe Yishun flat and sometimes at the Woodlands flat.72 The deceased would also stay in both\n\nthe said flats except that he stayed at the Yishun flat most of the time.73 The Plaintiff said that she was angry\n\nbecause Lim Chok Young spent a lot of time with the deceased in 1995 and 1996. When asked\n\nwhat led to the divorce in 1994, the Plaintiff explained that she and Lim Chok Young\n\nhardly talked to each other after the deceased moved in with them at the Hougang flat. The\n\ntwo men got along very well with each other and did not bother about her. On one occasion,\n\nLim Chok Young was out of the house for a few days and when questioned by her concerning\n\nhis whereabouts, he told her not to bother him. At times, he would shout at the Plaintiff\n\nor was very cold when he spoke to her.74 After she moved to the Woodlands flat,\n\nLim Chok Young asked for access to their daughter. She then gave him the keys to that\n\nflat. She also did not want her daughter’s schoolmates to find out about their\n\ndivorce. She then added that Lim Chok Young and the deceased were still living in the\n\nHougang flat after she had moved out. However, because of their daughter’s problems\n\nwith transport, she moved back to the Hougang flat and would return to the Woodlands flat\n\non weekends and on her days off from work.75 Asked how long such an arrangement\n\nlasted, the Plaintiff said it was not very long. After the Yishun flat was bought by Lim\n\nChok Young, the Hougang flat was sold and they moved to the Yishun flat. There, they again\n\ncould not get along with each other and the Plaintiff returned to the Woodlands flat. Lim\n\nChok Young remained at the Yishun flat and gradually moved to the Woodlands flat. She\n\nexplained it was because of all this that she was so confused in her testimony about which\n\nflat she was living in. None of the HDB flats in question had a long bath tub in the\n\nbathrooms. The conservancy and utility charges for the Woodlands flat were paid by Lim\n\nChok Young since he had gone to live there with the Plaintiff.76 The Plaintiff also said that she and\n\nLim Chok Young had resumed an occasional sexual relationship after the divorce. She could\n\nnot remember when they resumed such a relationship because it was not a recent event. She\n\nconfirmed what Lim Chok Young had stated in his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief, that they\n\nintended to re-marry. She explained that it was for the sake of their daughter.77 The divorced couple still had a POSB\n\naccount in their joint names. The Plaintiff explained that that was an old account used by\n\nLim Chok Young to pay the utility bills. The Plaintiff had never used this account\n\nherself. As for the $100,000 insurance money paid out by GE Life, the Plaintiff said the\n\ncheque was made out in her name but she could not recall where she banked it into. Money\n\nwas not that important to her, she explained. (Lim Chok Young would testify later that the\n\n$100,000 cheque was used to open a fixed deposit account in their joint names.)78 When they discovered the insurance\n\npolicies and the will in the Petir Road flat after the deceased’s death, the\n\nPlaintiff was shocked that the deceased had left so much money for her and was concerned\n\nthat people might misunderstand the situation. Lim Chok Young also wondered why the\n\ndeceased had given her so much money. He was also surprised that the deceased had all\n\nthose insurance policies and had made a will.79 When Lim Chok Young telephoned her from\n\nCambodia to inform her about the deceased’s demise, he told her to fax over a letter\n\nof authorization as there was a requirement there that only the relative of the deceased\n\ncould claim the deceased’s ashes after cremation. She faxed it over the next day. She\n\ndid not know why that was necessary as Lim Chok Young was the deceased’s nephew while\n\nshe was only his god-daughter. The Cambodian authorities apparently wanted someone from\n\nSingapore to fax over the said document. Asked why she was described as\n\n\"step-daughter\" of the deceased by the Singapore Embassy in Phnom Penh in their\n\nletter dated 3 June 1997 to Lim Chok Young to authorize him to have the deceased’s\n\nbody for cremation, the Plaintiff said that the person in the tour agency who prepared the\n\nletter of authorization for her must have translated \"god-daughter\" wrongly.80 In response to her own counsel, the\n\nPlaintiff explained that she had divorced Lim Chok Young in 1994 because she was very\n\nangry with him. She wanted to use the divorce to frighten him into treating her well\n\nagain. During the divorce proceedings, Lim Chok Young tried to dissuade her from\n\nproceeding but she was adamant. She maintained that the divorce was no sham. While she\n\nremained in the Hougang flat after the divorce, she was still hoping for a reconciliation.\n\nWhen she moved to the Woodlands flat, she had lost all hopes of reconciliation. She had\n\ngone to Lim Chok Young’s Yishun flat and walked about aimlessly, eventually going up\n\nto his flat probably because she was still thinking about him. The church counselling was\n\nthen going on and she was still hoping that they could get back together. Their decision\n\nto get back together again had nothing to do with the insurance monies in question. It was\n\ndue to the counselling sessions and to Lim Chok Young consoling her when she felt down.\n\nShe felt that he still loved her and their daughter.81 Lim Chok Young affirmed two Affidavits\n\nof Evidence-in-Chief. In the first one, he said he was working for the Ministry of the\n\nEnvironment as a container truck driver earning a month salary of about $1,600. The\n\ndeceased was his father’s younger brother. He had met the deceased at family\n\ngatherings. Sometime in the 1980s, he met his uncle again and learned that he was staying\n\nwith some friends and was then an odd job labourer. He then invited the deceased to the\n\nHougang flat.82 The deceased began to visit him and the\n\nPlaintiff frequently and would stay overnight for several days. They all got along well\n\nwith one another. The deceased complained about his living arrangements with his friends\n\nand, as his relative, Lim Chok Young felt sorry for him and invited him to live with his\n\nfamily temporarily. The deceased accepted.83 His uncle was not married and had no\n\nchildren. About seven to eight years ago, he decided to take the Plaintiff as his\n\ngod-daughter. He was a quiet man of simple needs and not given to consuming alcohol. He\n\nwould usually smoke a packet of cigarettes daily and sometimes would go to a Taoist temple\n\nto pray.84 In 1994, Lim Chok Young and the\n\nPlaintiff divorced. In her petition dated 23 May 1994, the Plaintiff stated the following:\"9. That the marriage has\n\n  irretrievably broken down.10. That the Respondent has behaved in\n\n  such a away that the Petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the Respondent.\n\n  (Section 88(3)(b), Cap. 353).PARTICULARSa) That since marriage, the Respondent\n\n  failed to provide sufficient maintenance to the Petitioner and the child. The Respondent\n\n  gave meagre sum towards maintenance and only on demand. As a result, the family and\n\n  household expenses were provided for by the Petitioner.b) That since marriage, the Respondent was\n\n  in the habit of keeping late nights. When questioned about his late nights, the Respondent\n\n  would quarrel with the Petitioner and the Petitioner was told not to interfere in his\n\n  private affairs.c) That due to the attitude and behaviour\n\n  of the Respondent, there were frequent quarrels between the Petitioner and the Respondent\n\n  whereby the Petitioner became mentally depressed and could not concentrate in her works.d) That throughout the marriage, the\n\n  Respondent neglected the family and never showed any love and concern for the Petitioner\n\n  and the child. The Respondent often went out alone without bringing the family along.e) That since early 1993, the Respondent\n\n  behaved very cold towards the Petitioner and the Respondent had for no apparent reason\n\n  moved into another room and had without the consent of the Petitioner, refused to resume\n\n  cohabitation with the Petitioner.\"Lim Chok Young did not enter an appearance\n\nand the divorce was not contested. Decree Nisi was pronounced on 25 August 1994. On 25\n\nNovember 1994, a consent order was made on the ancillary matters as Lim Chok Young had\n\nsigned a draft consent order containing the same terms on 27 October 1994 before the\n\nsolicitor acting for the Plaintiff in the divorce petition. The Plaintiff was given\n\ncustody of their daughter with reasonable access to Lim Chok Young. Lim Chok Young was to\n\npay the Plaintiff $250 per month as maintenance for the child and the Plaintiff was to\n\ntransfer her share and interest in the Hougang flat to Lim Chok Young upon repayment to\n\nher CPF account of the monies withdrawn (and interest) for the flat.85 In 1996, Lim Chok Young sold the\n\nHougang flat and bought the Yishun flat in the open market. The deceased moved with him\n\nfrom the Hougang flat to the Yishun flat.86 Despite their divorce, the couple\n\nstayed in contact with each other and Lim Chok Young would go to the Woodlands flat to\n\nvisit the daughter and to give her the maintenance money. In November 1996, they were\n\nbaptised after attending instruction classes together. Lim Chok Young went to say:\"As a result of our new religious\n\n  belief, we started to get back together, although we were legally divorced. I would go\n\n  over to the Plaintiff’s flat to stay there frequently. I sold off the Yishun flat and\n\n  in July 1998 moved in permanently at the Petitioner’s flat in Woodlands. We are now\n\n  reconciled as a family. We have plans to re-marry after the present matter is\n\n  resolved.\"87 In late 1996, Lim Chok Young helped the\n\ndeceased to purchase the three-room Petir Road flat by making the cash payment for him. He\n\nhad just sold the Hougang flat and therefore had available cash. They had agreed that the\n\ndeceased would sublet one of the two bedrooms to get some income to help pay the\n\ninstalments for that flat.88 In early 1997, Lim Chok Young and the\n\ndeceased started to take holiday trips to nearby countries such as Malaysia, Thailand and\n\nIndonesia as the deceased had won several thousand dollars in a lottery in late 1996 or\n\nearly 1997. Each time they went on a trip, they would buy travel insurance. Lim Chok Young\n\nexplained:\"I must explain that I have a very\n\n  strong conviction about the benefits of insurance. This came about when I witnessed a\n\n  colleague’s sudden death around 1978 or 1979. When I was at the funeral wake, I\n\n  learnt that the insurance company (NTUC) had paid out a sum of $15,000 even before the\n\n  body was cremated. This made a very deep impression on me that insurance could take care\n\n  of family needs that arose unexpectedly, such as the sudden death of my colleague. My\n\n  first insurance policy was with NTUC, a 15-year savings policy which has since\n\n  matured.\"In 1994, when Lim Chok Young went to\n\nChina, he bought $500,000 in travel insurance. He would buy travel insurance whenever he\n\ntravelled but he has discarded the policies upon their expiry.89 Coming back to the Cambodian trip, Lim\n\nChok Young said that the initial plan was to visit Vietnam on a five-day tour costing\n\n$888.00. Lim Chok Young and the deceased went to tour agencies to scout around for\n\nbargains and came across one at Golden Mile Tower offering a five-day tour to Phnom Penh\n\nfor $588.00. As that would result in savings of $300.00 per person, they decided to change\n\ntheir destination. They booked the tour on 21 April 1997 and paid a deposit of $400.00.\n\nThe tour was to take place from 30 May to 3 June 1997.90 As the deceased had indicated earlier\n\nthat he would like to purchase travel insurance for the trip, Lim Chok Young then went to\n\nthe First Defendants and handed in an application form on the deceased’s behalf. That\n\nform had been signed earlier on 8 April 1997 as it was originally intended for a trip to\n\nMalaysia and Indonesia. He paid the premium of $79 and was repaid by the deceased later.\n\nHe decided not to buy travel insurance for himself from the First Defendants as he felt\n\nthe premium was a bit too expensive and he could get better deals elsewhere.91 Between 21 April 1997 (when the tour\n\nwas booked) and 30 May 1997 (the departure date), Lim Chok Young and the deceased bought\n\nthe other travel insurance policies in question as they had learnt from speaking to others\n\nthat Cambodia was not a safe place, with its unstable social and political situation and\n\nthe landmines. They contemplated cancelling the tour but decided to proceed with it upon\n\nlearning that their $400.00 deposit would be forfeited. While the deceased bought five\n\ntravel insurance policies, Lim Chok Young bought three as he was already covered under\n\nother policies. Lim Chok Young’s policies were with the Second and the Fifth\n\nDefendants and Tai Ping Insurance Co.92 Lim Chok Young went on to explain how\n\nthe various policies came about. He bought from the First Defendants because both he and\n\nthe deceased had bought policies from them in February 1997. The next policy (from the\n\nFourth Defendants) was bought when both of them were shopping as they would walk into\n\ntravel agencies to look at the colourful posters. They had also bought travel insurance\n\nfrom the Fourth Defendants previously in March 1997. The third policy was bought from the\n\nFifth Defendants through the tour agency where they booked the Cambodian tour. They were\n\npersuaded to buy another policy despite having told the travel agent that they were\n\nalready covered by insurance. The fourth policy (from the Third Defendants) was bought on\n\nanother shopping trip as it was additional protection at relatively low cost. The fifth\n\npolicy was bought from the Second Defendants. Lim Chok Young had policies with the Second\n\nDefendants which had a branch in Yishun Central which he went to frequently as he was\n\nliving in the Yishun flat then. The staff there would encourage him to buy more travel\n\ninsurance for additional cover.93 The premiums for the various policies\n\nbought by the deceased were paid by Lim Chok Young first. He was reimbursed later in cash\n\nby the deceased, who was a very proud person who would always insist on paying for his\n\ntrips and insurance premiums.94 Both of them left Singapore on 30 May\n\n1997 for Phnom Penh. The tour group had six persons. They shared room 505 at the Pailin\n\nHotel there. They had dinner and returned to the hotel at about 9 pm.95 Day 2 was spent visiting temples and\n\nmuseums with short rest periods back at the hotel. The day’s programme ended at 9 pm.96 On Day 3, the deceased said his legs\n\nwere aching and he did not like the food and decided not to join the tour group on its\n\nouting. Lim Chok Young went with the group. The deceased joined them for lunch and for\n\ndinner at the hotel. He appeared normal.97 Day 4 (2 June 1997) had no activity\n\nplanned but it was to be the most eventful one. The other four members of the group\n\ndecided to fly to Siem Reap to tour the Angkor Wat. Lim Chok Young decided to keep his\n\nuncle company as the latter did not wish to go for the optional day trip. Both of them had\n\nbreakfast at the hotel and then chatted with the rest of the group in the lobby. A couple\n\nin the group asked Lim Chok Young to develop a roll of film for them at the photo studio\n\nopposite the hotel. He agreed to do so as he also had a roll to develop. He crossed the\n\nroad to the said studio and left the rolls of film there. He then went back to room 505\n\nwith the deceased. It was past 9 am then.98 Back in the room, they lazed around,\n\nwatched television and chatted. At past 10 am, two chambermaids entered the room to clean\n\nit for about 15 minutes. At about 11 am, Lim Chok Young had his shower. He then took some\n\ncoffee and tidied up his luggage. He suggested to the deceased to take a bath before they\n\nwent for lunch as the deceased enjoyed bathing in the bath tub because he could not do so\n\nat home. The deceased then turned on the water.99 At about 11.30 am, Lim Chok Young left\n\nthe room to collect the negatives and the photographs from the studio across the road.\n\nBefore he left, he informed the deceased to meet him at the lobby at about 12 noon. The\n\ndeceased was standing beside the bathroom and the bath tub was still being filled. Two\n\nchambermaids were in the corridor when he left the room.100 After collecting the negatives and the\n\nphotographs, Lim Chok Young returned to the lobby where he inserted the photographs into\n\nthe albums while waiting for the deceased. When he did not turn up at about 12.15 pm, Lim\n\nChok Young went up to the room. The two chambermaids he saw earlier were standing near the\n\npassageway to the room.101 He unlocked the door and noticed that\n\nthe bathroom door was shut and the television set was switched on. He put down the albums\n\nand knocked on the bathroom door. There was no response although there was the sound of\n\nrunning water. When he pushed the door open, he saw the naked deceased lying face down in\n\nthe bathtub filled with water. That scared him and he immediately called for help.102 The two chambermaids came running into\n\nthe room and they helped Lim Chok Young to lift the body out of the bath tub and onto the\n\nfloor. Immediately thereafter, many people went into the room to offer help. Some men\n\nhelped to move the body onto the bed. Lim Chok Young put a t-shirt and a pair of shorts on\n\nfor the deceased as the chambermaids were embarrassed by the naked body. The authorities\n\nthen arrived.103 Lim Chok Young was asked to go to\n\nanother room where he was questioned by the police until the evening. The police also told\n\nhim that there was no evidence of suicide or of murder.104 Later that evening, Lim Chok Young\n\ntelephoned the Plaintiff to tell her about the deceased's demise and discussed with her on\n\nwhat to do with the body. He had learnt that it would cost US$6,000 to bring the body back\n\nto Singapore. There would also be the attendant documentation. They decided that it would\n\nbe more convenient and would save them money to cremate the body and then bring the ashes\n\nhome. Lim Chok Young also called the tour agency in Singapore. The tour leader in Cambodia\n\nhelped him contact the Singapore Embassy for their assistance.105 The next day (Day 5, 3 June 1997), a\n\nrepresentative from the Singapore Embassy went to view the body which had been moved to a\n\ntemple for cremation. The Cambodian authorities did not tell Lim Chok Young whether an\n\nautopsy would be done. If he had known that the absence of an autopsy would lead to such\n\nallegations as had been made against him, he would certainly have brought the body back to\n\nSingapore for an autopsy.106 Lim Chok Young left Phnom Penh that\n\nday. The cremation took place on 4 June 1997 and he returned to Cambodia a few days\n\nthereafter to collect the ashes which were now kept at the Mandai Columbarium.107 Lim Chok Young then explained why the\n\ndeceased had bought so many travel insurance policies. The deceased had told him that if\n\nsome accident should cause him to become handicapped, the insurance monies would help take\n\ncare of his medical and nursing expenses as he had no children. He was looking to the\n\nPlaintiff to take care of him since she was his god-daughter. He was also afraid that he\n\nwould not be able to pay off the HDB loan for the Petir Road flat if anything untoward\n\nshould happen to him.108 As the deceased also told Lim Chok\n\nYoung that he wanted to make a will, he brought the deceased to a law firm (the\n\nPlaintiff’s present solicitors). He was not present when the deceased signed the\n\nwill. The deceased paid the legal fee himself.109 Lim Chok Young asserted that he had\n\nnothing to do with his uncle’s death and surmised that the Defendants were making the\n\nunfounded and malicious allegations against him and the Plaintiff to avoid paying on the\n\npolicies. The deceased was not suffering from any disease or illness and appeared to be in\n\ngood health on the day of departure for the tour. The only two occasions when Lim Chok\n\nYoung brought the deceased to see a Chinese physician were for an ache at his wrist and a\n\nskin problem at his feet. He found a Medical Examination Form dated 16 June 1990 in\n\nrespect of the deceased after his death. (That examination was apparently for the purpose\n\nof an application for a vocational licence by the deceased. The doctor who did the\n\nexamination was not called by the Plaintiff to testify although he had affirmed an\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief).110 Lim Chok Young helped the Plaintiff to\n\nlodge the clams with the various insurance companies. He was questioned by loss adjusters\n\nrepresenting the Defendants about the death and the circumstances leading to the purchase\n\nof so many policies. He told them that he was a \"strong believer in insurance\".\n\nPerhaps the deceased had been influenced when he saw Lim Chok Young buying insurance\n\npolicies so frequently. Lim Chok Young concluded his first Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nby reiterating his innocence in respect of the death.111 His second Affidavit of\n\nEvidence-in-Chief was in response to the Defendants’ first amendment to their Defence\n\nto allege that they had been induced to issue the policies by the deceased’s failure\n\nto disclose or concealment of material facts. Lim Chok Young said that the deceased’s\n\neye problem was nothing more than poor eyesight for which he wore corrective lenses. The\n\ndeceased had applied traditional Chinese ointment on his arms because of the skin\n\nirritation. He had not mentioned any infection or complained that it was painful. The\n\ndeceased was almost 61 years at the time of the last trip. His slowness in movements were\n\ntherefore nothing unusual.112 Except for the First Defendants, where\n\nan application form had been signed earlier for an intended trip to Malaysia and\n\nIndonesia, the deceased went personally to purchase the policies from the other four\n\nDefendants. When Lim Chok Young went to the First Defendants to purchase insurance for the\n\ndeceased, no questions were asked on whether the deceased had other insurance policies or\n\non the deceased’s state of health. However, Lim Chok Young was told that he could\n\ncall the First Defendants anytime for emergency help during the trip. As for the two\n\nearlier policies bought from the Second Defendants, it was the agent who filled in the\n\napplication form for the deceased who could not understand English. Where the travel\n\ninsurance policy bought from the Second Defendants on 27 May 1997 was concerned, similarly\n\nno questions other than those on the destination and the flight details were asked. That\n\nwas the same for the Third, Fourth and the Fifth Defendants.113 Lim Chok Young said he did not know\n\nthat the deceased had applied for insurance with AIA in 1996 or that he had gone for a\n\nmedical examination in connection therewith until informed by the Defendants’\n\nsolicitors. He was aware of the applications for personal accident insurance from AIA in\n\nMay 1997 as he had helped the deceased to forward the application forms to AIA. However,\n\nhe was not told that the applications had been turned down.114 In cross-examination, Lim Chok Young\n\nconfirmed that he had been interviewed by Chan Hwee Seng, the loss adjuster representing\n\nthe Defendants, and had made the statements shown in AB 197 to 209.115 He agreed that the Plaintiff and he\n\nwere currently living together as husband and wife although divorced in the eyes of the\n\nlaw. He helped to pay for the utilities bills of the Woodlands flat. He also confirmed\n\nthat they had a joint account which both of them were using.116 Although Lim Chok Young agreed that\n\none of the reasons for buying travel insurance was to provide for repatriation from abroad\n\nto receive treatment back home, he did not pay attention to such a provision in the\n\npolicies in question.117 The Petir Road flat of the deceased\n\ncost $133,000. Lim Chok Young paid the whole of the initial down payment of 20% of the\n\nprice to the HDB. The monthly instalments came up to about $500. The rental received for\n\nrenting out one of the two bedrooms was $900 per month. The difference of $400 was used by\n\nthe deceased for his daily expenses. The flat had since been sold for about $130,000.118 Lim Chok Young disagreed with the\n\nsuggestion that he had made use of the deceased to purchase the Petir Road flat as an\n\ninvestment for himself. He felt that as he had paid for the flat on the deceased’s\n\nbehalf, should the deceased die, he should be entitled to the flat. However, he did not\n\ncause any document to be signed by the deceased to ensure that. He disagreed that he\n\nprotected his interest by causing the deceased to make the will in February 1997. The will\n\nwas part of an arrangement between Lim Chok Young and the deceased who wanted him to\n\nmanage his estate. The deceased had asked him to go with him to see a lawyer and he did\n\nso. They went to the present solicitors through the recommendation of a security guard at\n\nthe commercial complex.119 He was then asked about the $100,000\n\npaid out by GE Life to the Plaintiff in 1998. Lim Chok Young said he went with the\n\nPlaintiff to place the amount in a fixed deposit in their joint names with the Standard\n\nChartered Bank. The money was withdrawn prematurely from time to time to pay various\n\nexpenses, with about $20,000 remaining.120 When the cross-examination resumed the\n\nnext day, Lim Chok Young corrected his earlier evidence and stated that the $100,000\n\ncheque from GE Life was deposited in a branch of the OCBC Bank near the Woodlands flat.\n\nThe fixed deposit account there was also in the joint names of Lim Chok Young and the\n\nPlaintiff. From there, $20,000 was withdrawn for Lim Chok Young to buy a second hand car\n\nand $10,000 was used for their legal fees and other expenses. The balance of $70,000 was\n\nthen placed in a fixed deposit in their joint names with the Standard Chartered\n\nBank’s branch at Tiong Bahru. From that fixed deposit, sums of money were withdrawn\n\nto pay their legal fees, leaving about $17,000 still in that account. Lim Chok Young then\n\nproduced an advice slip dated 23 September 1999 from the Standard Chartered Bank (PB 107)\n\nwhich showed that the 18-month fixed deposit of $70,000 was withdrawn prematurely.121 Lim Chok Young confirmed that they\n\nwould also deposit the $800,000 claimed in these proceedings into their joint accounts\n\nshould the Plaintiff succeed in her claim.122 Asked by the Court to clarify about\n\nthe car bought by him since the Plaintiff had told the Court earlier that neither of them\n\nhad a car, Lim Chok Young said he bought the car at the close of 1998 and sold it two or\n\nthree months later in February 1999. He sold it because he had no need for a car and had\n\nbought it only because the previous owner needed some money. He did not know that person\n\nvery well.123 Going back to the issue of the will,\n\nLim Chok Young testified that he and the deceased had discussed the question of who the\n\nbeneficiary should be but the deceased did not tell him his decision on that matter. He\n\ndid not ask the deceased about it but was quite sure that he would be named as the sole\n\nbeneficiary. He knew what the intended contents of the will would be but did not know how\n\nthe deceased obtained the Plaintiff’s particulars.124 He accompanied the deceased on the\n\nfirst visit to the law firm but the deceased met and discussed with the lawyer alone. The\n\ndeceased went by himself on another occasion to collect the will from the law firm.125 A few days later, Lim Chok Young went\n\nto the deceased’s Petir Road flat and enquired about the will. The deceased then\n\nshowed it to him. He was surprised that he was not named the beneficiary. After that, the\n\ndeceased kept the will somewhere in the bedroom.126 With regard to the exact nature of the\n\nrelationship between Lim Chok Young and the deceased, he had thought all along that the\n\ndeceased was his late father’s brother until the incident on the second day of the\n\ntrial (mentioned earlier). He then checked with his mother and found out that the deceased\n\nand his late father were actually sworn brothers. Lim Chok Young’s father passed away\n\n34 years ago aged slightly older than 40.127 Lim Chok Young agreed that it looked\n\nstrange for the deceased not to cancel the Cambodian trip and lose $200 each but\n\neventually pay $275 in premiums for all the travel insurance. If the premiums for the\n\nthree unsuccessful applications to AIA were included, the premiums would exceed $1,000.\n\nThe policies got cheaper and cheaper as Lim Chok Young bought more insurance. The more he\n\nbought, the better the protection, he explained.128 For the first policy (from the First\n\nDefendants), the deceased was not with him when he went to buy the insurance. Therefore,\n\neven though he thought the premium of $79 was rather expensive, he bought anyway as\n\nrequested to save himself the inconvenience of a second trip. After all, the deceased had\n\nhanded him the First Defendants’ application form with his thumbprint on it and would\n\nbe reimbursing him anyway. He did this although it was their habit to go around looking at\n\ntour agencies and he was going to buy insurance for himself from other insurance\n\ncompanies.129 When the policy was purchased from the\n\nFirst Defendants, a card listing the services provided together with a 24-hour emergency\n\nservice telephone number in Singapore was given by the insurance company. However, Lim\n\nChok Young said he did not read this information which was on the reverse side of the\n\ncard.130 Asked why the Fourth Defendants’\n\npolicy apparently issued on 15 May 1997 (AB 54) should bear the date stamp 6 March 1997,\n\nLim Chok Young said he was not able to explain. He also did not know why two policies (AB\n\n39 and 40) issued for earlier trips in March and April 1997 also bore the date stamp 6\n\nMarch 1997.131 Lim Chok Young’s hobby was to\n\nvisit tour agencies with the deceased tagging along. They would make enquiries with the\n\nstaff who would recommend their policies. That explained why the five travel insurance\n\npolicies were bought through different tour agencies. As for the policy from GE Life for\n\n$100,000, Lim Chok Young had opened a joint account with the deceased at OCBC Bank which\n\nhad a savings scheme insurance for account holders. He read the terms and conditions of\n\nthat scheme and, seeing that the premium was only about $10 per month, bought a policy.\n\nThe deceased also bought one. The joint account was opened because the deceased told him\n\nthat he had applied for a job for which the salary would be paid by cheque. They opened\n\nthe joint account in case the deceased was successful so that he could bank in his cheques\n\nand Lim Chok Young could withdraw money for him.132 The three unsuccessful applications to\n\nAIA came about this way. Two agents from AIA telephoned the Woodlands flat to look for the\n\ndeceased who was not in the flat then. They told Lim Chok Young that they had an\n\nappointment with the deceased. They also knew Lim Chok Young as they had obtained his\n\nparticulars from the Standard Chartered Bank. They asked whether they could go over to the\n\nWoodlands flat to discuss insurance matters. Lim Chok Young told them he had no intention\n\nof buying more as he already had several insurance policies. They said they would\n\nrecommend something to Lim Chok Young anyway.133 When they arrived, they said that the\n\ndeceased could buy only accident policies because of his age. They asked Lim Chok Young to\n\nbuy insurance for the deceased. Lim Chok Young telephoned the deceased who was at the\n\nPetir Road flat and told him about this. The deceased did not want to buy any. However,\n\nthe two agents from AIA were persistent. Lim Chok Young therefore told the deceased that\n\nhe was the one who had invited the agents to the Woodlands flat and that they were\n\nrefusing to leave. The deceased then relented and told Lim Chok Young to oblige them and\n\nbuy $100,000 worth of insurance. However, the agents persuaded Lim Chok Young to purchase\n\nhalf a million dollars worth instead. He told them the deceased was not working and they\n\nresponded by suggesting something in between the two figures – i.e. $300,000 –\n\nand told Lim Chok Young that the deceased could buy only up to the time he attained 65\n\nyears of age. The premium was $600 for every half year. They then filled up the\n\napplication form and told Lim Chok Young to bring it to the deceased for his signature.134 Lim Chok Young said that he had\n\nindicated his wish to join the optional tour of the Angkor Wat at the time of booking but\n\nwas not required to make any payment for the optional tour at that time. He disagreed with\n\nthe suggestion that he had no intention of visiting the Angkor Wat and had planned to use\n\nthat day to carry his plan to cause the deceased’s death. He did not go because the\n\ndeceased was weak, he had seen that the Cambodian aeroplane was not very safe, the airport\n\nfacilities were poor and there were many soldiers on the road. Besides , it would cost\n\nUS$100 per person. They could not leave for Singapore on the fourth day because the\n\nfive-day tour was a special promotion.135 Lim Chok Young confirmed that the\n\nPailin Hotel was airconditioned.136 Asked why he did not at least lift the\n\ndeceased out of the water in the bath tub when he discovered him lying in there, Lim Chok\n\nYoung said he thought the deceased wanted to splash water on him. When he had looked\n\ncarefully, he then shouted at the top of his voice. He could not have lifted the body out\n\nof the water by himself. In any event, he was in shock. He did not mention his thought\n\nthat the deceased wanted to splash water on him in his Affidavits of Evidence-in-Chief\n\nbecause he just recalled that the deceased used to joke with him.137 When he made the telephone call to the\n\nPlaintiff later that evening, he told her to inform the tour agency about the death and to\n\nsend someone over to help. On 3 June 1997, he sought the assistance of the Singapore\n\nEmbassy. Since he had heard that it would cost US$6,000 to send the body back, he wanted\n\nto borrow money from the Embassy. The Embassy could not lend him the money unless someone\n\nin Singapore deposited money in Singapore. The Plaintiff was not able to get this amount\n\nof money. The representative from the Embassy told him that it would be more convenient\n\nand less costly to cremate the body in Cambodia. He required two signatures before\n\napproving the cremation and Lim Chok Young therefore telephoned the Plaintiff to prepare\n\nthe document and fax it over. During all this time, it did not occur to him that he had\n\nfive insurance policies in the deceased’s name as he was pulled from one place to\n\nanother.138 Lim Chok Young forgot to bring the\n\nemergency service cards issued by his three insurers to Cambodia. It did not occur to him\n\nto contact one of the insurance companies anyway. On 2 June 1997 evening, he told the\n\nhotel’s staff to inform the tour agency in Singapore about the incident and to send\n\nsomebody over to Cambodia immediately. The next day, the tour agency called him and told\n\nhim to seek the assistance of the Singapore Embassy. He also told the tour agency to\n\ncontact the insurance companies but was told to contact the Singapore Embassy instead.139 The deceased had also forgotten to\n\nbring the cards containing the emergency telephone numbers of the insurance companies\n\nalong on the trip. Both of them intended to bring the cards with them but in the course of\n\npacking forgot to do it. It never crossed Lim Chok Young’s mind while he was in\n\nCambodia that the deceased had bought five travel insurance policies. Similarly, he did\n\nnot think about his own policies.140 The deceased had also applied to AIA\n\nfor a whole life policy of $30,000 on 1 October 1996. He borrowed money from Lim Chok\n\nYoung to pay the $770.90 premium. After some time, the deceased told him it was\n\ntroublesome to buy insurance and he did not want to do so anymore. Lim Chok Young then\n\nasked for the return of the money he had borrowed for the premium. The deceased paid him\n\nwith a cheque issued by AIA. Lim Chok Young did not know that the application was not\n\nsuccessful. The doctor who examined the deceased for the purpose of the application had\n\ncommented in the examination form then that the deceased was of low mentality and behaved\n\nolder than his 60 years. Lim Chok Young did not agree with such an assessment.141 Lim Chok Young claimed that he and the\n\nPlaintiff had gone together to the various insurance companies to submit the claim forms.\n\nWhen he was asked by the insurance companies to sign on the forms, he did so. That was why\n\nhis signature appeared on every claim form while the Plaintiff signed only one claim form.142 Asked whether he agreed that he only\n\nstarted travelling with the deceased after the making of the will in February 1997, Lim\n\nChok Young claimed that the trips had nothing to do with the will. The deceased was out of\n\njob during that period and kept asking him to go on overseas trips with him as he (the\n\ndeceased) was free.143 The sale proceeds of the Petir Road\n\nflat were paid by cheque to the Plaintiff who deposited it into their joint account. She\n\nalso repaid Lim Chok Young the 20% down payment he had made on the deceased’s behalf.\n\nNo profit was made from the sale. The deceased had lived in that flat for less than the\n\nminimum two and a half years and they had to apply to the HDB for permission to sell the\n\nflat in the open market before the minimum period expired as prices of resale flats were\n\nfalling. By the time it was sold in 1998, after deducting the mortgage payments, the\n\nagent’s commission and other expenses, there was a net loss. Defence Counsel then\n\npointed out to Lim Chok Young that the prospective buyer lodged the caveat against the\n\nflat only on 3 March 1999 and completed the sale on 18 June 1999 at the price of $133,000.\n\nLim Chok Young could not remember the dates but agreed that the sale price was $133,000,\n\nthe same as the price paid by the deceased for the flat.144 Lim Chok Young had asked the deceased\n\nwhy he did not name him as the beneficiary in the will but the deceased smiled and replied\n\nthat naming his wife as the beneficiary amounted to the same thing as they were all one\n\nfamily. He had also questioned the deceased about why he named the Plaintiff as the\n\nbeneficiary in some of the insurance policies. The deceased replied it was because the\n\nPlaintiff was his god-daughter and had taken care of him. Further, Lim Chok Young was\n\ntravelling with him.145 Asked to comment on the\n\nPlaintiff’s testimony that he expressed surprise when they found the will and the\n\npolicies after the death of the deceased, Lim Chok Young said he merely remarked casually,\n\n\"Wah, you would be in trouble\" and surmised that the Plaintiff must have drawn\n\nher own conclusion from that remark. Lim Chok Young said he meant that it was not going to\n\nbe easy to attend to so many matters in administering the estate, including the Petir Road\n\nflat.146 In re-examination, Lim Chok Young\n\nexplained that he helped the deceased to buy the $400,000 or so worth of personal accident\n\ninsurance as he (Lim Chok Young) had read that the accident rate for elderly persons was\n\nvery high and had been shown statistics of accidents happening to the elderly and the very\n\nhigh medical and living expenses. He would not want to send the deceased to an old\n\nfolks’ home if an accident should happen to the latter as he did social work by\n\nvisiting such homes and saw how difficult life was there.147 The deceased, although unemployed for\n\nabout six months in 1997, had some savings. He had also won the 4-D lottery at the end of\n\n1996. Even if he could not afford to pay for the policies, Lim Chok Young would help him\n\npay. After his death, Lim Chok Young found about $5,000 to $6,000 in the Petir Road flat\n\ntogether with some $1,000 in coins.148 He suggested to the deceased to buy\n\nthe Petir Road flat as prices were rising and he might not be able to afford one later. It\n\nwas more convenient for him to own a flat himself. Besides that, he could rent out one\n\nbedroom and earn some income. If prices rose further, they could sell and share the\n\nprofits.149 He suggested the will to the deceased\n\nas the HDB could repossess the Petir Road flat if the deceased passed away. After all,\n\nthey were only uncle and nephew.150 The deceased spoke in Hokkien to Lim\n\nChok Young, a Teochew. Lim Chok Young found it strange initially as the deceased was\n\nsupposed to be the youngest brother of his late father. He questioned the deceased about\n\nthis but he did not seem happy about it and so the matter was not pursued. That was over a\n\ndecade ago. He had never asked his mother about the deceased. Lim Chok Young had seen the\n\ndeceased at his late father’s funeral when he was four or five years old. He\n\nremembered that the deceased loved him very much. They met again a few years later at a\n\ndinner during the seventh lunar month. Lim Chok Young’s family was also at that\n\ndinner. They met again in town a few years later when the deceased chided him for not\n\naddressing him and mentioned Lim Chok Young’s father’s name. Ever since that\n\ntime, Lim Chok Young addressed the deceased as uncle. Lim Chok Young had never met the\n\nother three of his father’s brothers. He did not know the Defendants’ two\n\nadditional witnesses who were claiming to be the relatives of the deceased.151 The Fourth Defendants’ insurance\n\nforms (AB 39 and 40) could not be obtained unless one paid the premium for the policy.152 Lim Chok Young went on to explain why\n\nhe had thought the deceased was going to splash water on him when he opened the bathroom\n\ndoor in the hotel in Cambodia that fateful day. He gave two previous instances where the\n\ndeceased played practical jokes on him during their trips.153 Lim Chok Young ended by expressing his\n\noutrage at the malicious allegations of criminal conduct hurled at him in order to\n\n\"eat up\" the insurance monies. The deceased and he were like father and son, he\n\nhad looked after the deceased for more than 10 years, helped him pay for the flat, brought\n\nhim on trips because \"he wanted a taste of taking aeroplanes\". \"Why should\n\nI want to murder him?\" Lim Chok Young asked rhetorically. Further, GE Life had\n\ninvestigated the claim and paid the full amount insured.154 In reply to my questions, Lim Chok\n\nYoung said that his relationship with the Plaintiff had deteriorated in the past because\n\nhe kept late nights and she wondered where he had gone to with the deceased. He tried\n\nexplaining to her but she did not listen. After the divorce petition was served on him, he\n\ntried to make up but the Plaintiff avoided him and refused to talk to him. He then agreed\n\nto the divorce with much regret thereafter. Not long after the divorce, their daughter\n\nfell ill and they had to look after her and therefore began to communicate again. Their\n\nrelationship then improved.155 For about a year or so after the\n\ndivorce, Lim Chok Young and the Plaintiff continued to share the bedroom in the Hougang\n\nflat. The Woodlands flat was not ready and their daughter was schooling in Hougang. The\n\ndeceased would sleep in the other bedroom or in the living room of the Hougang flat.156 Towards the end of 1995, Lim Chok\n\nYoung bought the Yishun flat for $128,000 in the open market. The HDB permitted single\n\npersons older than 35 to buy a three-room flat in the suburban areas. He sold it about two\n\nand a half years later in July 1998 for $153,000. These HDB rules had been around for 10\n\nyears or so but he came to know about them only after the divorce when he was making\n\nenquiries with the HDB during the transfer of the Hougang flat. He rented out one of the\n\ntwo bedrooms of the Yishun flat for only three to five months at $450 per month. He had\n\ndecided to move out of the Hougang flat because it was not nice to meet the neighbours\n\nafter the divorce.157 Lim Chok Young said he shuttled\n\nbetween the Yishun and the Woodlands flats. If the daughter was not attending school, he\n\nwould stay in the Woodlands flat. If she went to the Yishun flat after school, he would\n\nstay in the Yishun flat. The daughter would stay in whichever flat an adult was present.\n\nIf Lim Chok Young went to fetch her from school, he would bring her to the Yishun flat\n\nwhere she would stay overnight. When the Plaintiff, whose work ended late in the evening,\n\ncalled and found that the daughter was at the Yishun flat, she would go there to sleep the\n\nnight.158 Despite the divorce, the two of them\n\nwere practically living together as husband and wife. They had slept in different bedrooms\n\nsoon after the divorce but resumed sleeping in the same room again thereafter. In fact, by\n\nearly 1995, they had resumed their sexual relationship.159 When the Plaintiff obtained possession\n\nof the Woodlands flat, there were not many people in that area. Lim Chok Young was\n\ntherefore worried for her and for their daughter. After listening to his reasoning, the\n\nPlaintiff gave him the keys to the Woodlands flat.160 Lim Chok Young was able to spend time\n\ntravelling with the jobless deceased although he was still working as he had accumulated\n\nhis \"time offs\" and had medical and annual leave entitlements. They paid for\n\ntheir own trips but most of the time, Lim Chok Young would treat the deceased.161 For the Cambodian trip, they\n\noriginally intended to buy only one travel insurance policy worth $200,000. When they\n\nrealized that the country was not a safe place, they went to other tour agencies to buy\n\none or two more policies. $400,000 or thereabouts would have been sufficient cover for\n\nthem. They could not buy everything at one place because there was a fixed coverage for\n\nthis sort of insurance. Further, some agencies would sell only one policy per trip and\n\nthey therefore could not upgrade their cover from $200,000 to $400,000. Eventually, they\n\nbought $800,000 worth because \"the more we bought, the cheaper it became\".162 Lim Chok Young and his family did not\n\ntravel with the deceased because it was more convenient and cost-effective to book only\n\none hotel room for the family.163 It was very hot in Cambodia. Lim Chok\n\nYoung would take a shower in the morning and bathe in the tub in the evening. The deceased\n\ntook one bath a day. He enjoyed bathing in the bath tub, making a lot of sounds in the\n\nwater and would take some time. On 2 June 1997, the deceased was tired and not feeling\n\nwell as he had no appetite for food for the past two or three days. He was, however, not\n\nill. Lim Chok Young suggested that he take his bath as he thought the deceased would feel\n\nbetter after that. After the deceased turned the water on, he continued to talk to Lim\n\nChok Young as he wanted to finish smoking his cigarette before taking his bath. While his\n\nmovements were not fast, he had never fainted before. Lim Chok Young could not remember\n\nwhether the deceased also bathed in the tub on the other trips.164 I asked Lim Chok Young whether he had\n\never moved out of the bedroom he shared with the Plaintiff while they were living in the\n\nHougang flat. This was because of what was alleged by the Plaintiff in her divorce\n\npetition that he had since early 1993 moved into another room without her consent and\n\nrefused cohabitation. Lim Chok Young’s initial reply was \"No\". He then said\n\nthat occasionally, he would sleep in the other bedroom as he would switch on the lights\n\nand take a shower when he came home and did not wish to disturb the Plaintiff and their\n\ndaughter who were sleeping in the room. He then added that he liked to sleep in a room by\n\nhimself while living in the Hougang flat as he did not like people to touch him. They were\n\nsleeping in separate rooms for a few months before the divorce. In his next breath, the\n\nfew months became a few years before the divorce.165 After the divorce proceedings, which\n\ntook about half a year to conclude, Lim Chok Young realized that it was a serious matter\n\nand decided to treat the Plaintiff better. Their relationship then got better.166 The next three witnesses for the\n\nPlaintiff were the family members of Lim Chok Young, called to testify about the\n\nrelationship between the deceased and Lim Chok Young’s late father. Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s wheelchair bound mother, Chng Sok Choo, a housewife aged 74, testified that\n\nshe has four sons and an adopted daughter. She referred to some photographs of the\n\ndeceased and said that she recognized him as the sworn brother of her husband who passed\n\naway more than 30 years ago. The first time she saw the deceased was when he came to visit\n\nher husband at their home. Her husband told her the deceased was his sworn younger\n\nbrother. She learned that he was a casual labourer. The second time she saw the deceased\n\nwas when he attended the funeral wake of her husband. He also visited her a few years\n\nlater. Lim Chok Young had mentioned to her previously that the deceased was staying with\n\nhim. As she had difficulty walking, she never visited Lim Chok Young at his home.167 Lim Chok Young’s mother did not\n\nknow anything about her late husband’s brothers except that they were in China. She\n\ncould not recall how many there were or what their names were. Lim Chok Young told her\n\nsome time ago about the demise of the deceased. She could not recall whether she had told\n\nLim Chok Young that the deceased was his father’s sworn brother. She addressed the\n\ndeceased as \"Bak Chang Chek\" or \"Uncle Dumpling\" in Teochew as\n\ninstructed by her late husband.168 Lim Ah Choek, the elder brother of Lim\n\nChok Young, a businessman, testified that he had seen the deceased at their father’s\n\nfuneral wake about 34 years ago. Lim Ah Choek was 16 years old then. The deceased told him\n\nthat he was their father’s sworn brother. After that, he did not see the deceased for\n\nmany years. In 1991, he went to Lim Chok Young’s Hougang flat to deliver a used\n\ntelevision set to him. he was surprised to see the deceased alone in the flat. The\n\ndeceased told him that Lim Chok Young had gone out and that he was staying with him. Lim\n\nAh Choek placed the television set in the flat and then left.169 Sometime later, he asked Lim Chok\n\nYoung about the deceased staying with them as he was concerned about the Plaintiff’s\n\nfeelings. Lim Chok Young told him that the Plaintiff had no objections and was helping the\n\ndeceased with his laundry and his meals, that the deceased was kind-hearted and would not\n\ncheat or take advantage of him. Having been thus reassured, Lim Ah Choek did not raise the\n\nmatter again. He has also not seen the deceased since then, even when he visited the\n\nHougang flat which was no more than once a year as he was a busy man.170 In cross-examination, Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s brother said he only knew the deceased was his uncle. He did not know the\n\ndeceased’s name and had never told Lim Chok Young that the deceased was the sworn\n\nbrother of their late father. Lim Chok Young told him over the telephone a few years ago\n\nthat their \"sworn uncle\" had passed away abroad. Asked whether Lim Chok Young\n\nalready knew at the time of the telephone conversation that the deceased was the sworn\n\nbrother of their late father, Lim Ah Choek said, \"yes\".171 The final witness for the Plaintiff\n\nwas Ng Guak Chuan, the adopted elder sister of Lim Chok Young, working as a cook in a food\n\ncourt. Her surname was not Lim as she was adopted. About 12 years ago, on the first day of\n\nChinese New Year, she visited Lim Chok Young at the Hougang flat after visiting their\n\nmother who also lived in Hougang Avenue 3. She remembered the year clearly because her\n\neldest daughter was 12 then and is now 22 years old. That was the one and only time she\n\nvisited Lim Chok Young at his Hougang flat. On that occasion, she saw a thin, old man\n\neating rice at the table. Lim Chok Young introduced him as their uncle, \"Bak Chang\n\nChek\". She has not met the deceased since then and neither did she visit Lim Chok\n\nYoung again.172 The adopted sister testified that she\n\nwould not be able to recognize the deceased now. When she was asked to be a witness, Lim\n\nChok Young and their mother mentioned the deceased’s name and Lim Chok Young reminded\n\nher that she had met the deceased at his Hougang flat about 12 years ago. Although she did\n\nnot speak to the deceased then, she maintained that she did see him at the Hougang flat.\n\nShe attended the funeral wake of Lim Chok Young’s father but did not see the deceased\n\nthere then.",
        "THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE": "173 Dr Gilbert Lau is the Director of\n\nForensic Pathology at the Department of Forensic Medicine, Institute of Science and\n\nForensic Medicine, Singapore. He has been practising forensic pathology since 1987. He was\n\nasked to render an expert medical opinion on the cause(s) of death of the deceased and on\n\nthe conclusions of Dr Lek Se based on the documents issued by the Cambodian authorities\n\nand on the preliminary report dated 29 July 1997 by the Defendants’ loss adjusters.174 In his opinion contained in a letter\n\ndated 5 April 1999 to the Defendants’ solicitors, Dr Gilbert Lau stated that the\n\nconclusion that the deceased had drowned in the bath tub, as a consequence of a fainting\n\nspell, appeared to have been based almost entirely on circumstantial evidence, the\n\nstrength of which he was unable to ascertain. He noted that the mere presence of water in\n\nthe stomach was not strictly diagnostic of drowning. In his view, such a case would\n\nwarrant a full autopsy, supplemented by a review of the deceased’s medical history\n\n(particularly of previous fainting spells, heart disease and strokes), in order to exclude\n\nthe possibility that the deceased:(1) died from natural causes such as a\n\n  heart attack or a stroke prior to immersion in water. This was particularly important\n\n  since the deceased was known to have been a heavy cigarette smoker;(2) died from a combination of drowning\n\n  and some underlying disease or abnormality;(3) drowned accidentally, irrespective of\n\n  any putative, pre-existing, natural disease; or(4) was a victim of homicide.Dr Gilbert Lau concluded his opinion by\n\nstating that he would not be able to gain access to the deceased’s past medical\n\nhistory as the death did not occur in Singapore and was therefore not reported to the\n\nCoroner. Further, he doubted that a trip by him to Cambodia would serve any useful\n\npurpose.175 In his Affidavit of Evidence-in-Chief,\n\nDr Gilbert Lau elaborated on his opinion that it was not possible to diagnose drowning as\n\nthe definitive cause or sole cause of death from only an external examination of the body.\n\nHe referred to various medical literature to support his view that it was not possible to\n\nconclude that drowning, either as a result of syncope or fainting or otherwise, was the\n\ncause of death merely from an observation that there was water in the deceased’s\n\nstomach. He elaborated that homicide included poisoning or drugging the deceased prior to\n\nimmersion in water and also holding him underwater.176 An autopsy would involve a\n\ncomprehensive external and internal post-mortem examination of the body, thus avoiding\n\nconjecture. In a case of suspected drowning, particular emphasis would be placed on\n\nestablishing the presence of froth or water in the airways and the lungs. A detailed and\n\ncareful autopsy would also be indispensable in excluding the presence of fatal or serious\n\ninternal injuries, particularly of the head, neck and abdomen, which may not be visible\n\nexternally. Only then can the possibility of foul play or homicide be ruled out.177 If no gross pathology (i.e. any\n\nabnormality visible to the naked eye) was found, ancillary investigations such as the\n\nhistological (microscopic) examination of relevant tissue specimens, especially of the\n\nheart and the lungs, would be necessary to exclude the possibility that the deceased died\n\nfrom natural causes or disease or a combination of drowning and some underlying disease.\n\nFurther, toxicological analyses of the deceased’s blood sample and other body fluid\n\nand tissue specimens such as urine, bile, gastric contents, vitreous humour and liver\n\ntissue, were necessary to exclude the possibility of poisoning, intoxication or drug\n\noverdose.178 Having heard the evidence of the three\n\nwitnesses from Cambodia, Dr Gilbert Lau maintained his opinions, based on his training and\n\nexperience in Singapore and in the United Kingdom.179 In cross-examination, Dr Gilbert Lau\n\ntestified that he would also study the surroundings at a scene of death particularly if\n\nthe death was a suspicious one. He was rarely shown statements made by witnesses to the\n\npolice and, if shown such statements, would ignore them anyway so that his professional\n\nopinion would not be affected. He referred to the report of the loss adjusters for the\n\nrelevant aspects pertaining to the circumstances of death and not for the quantum of the\n\nclaim. In fact, he did not accord much weight to it as it contained very little forensic\n\nor medical information.180 In Singapore, all unnatural death\n\ncases, which would include drowning, were subject to autopsy. That was also the practice\n\nin Britain. In other countries, an autopsy would not necessarily be done for unnatural\n\ndeath cases. It would not be unreasonable to conclude that the deceased might have drowned\n\nin this case but one could not ascertain this without an autopsy. If autopsy facilities\n\nwere unavailable, then the cause of death should have been left as unascertained. In his\n\nopinion, a forensic practitioner must, in all circumstances, arrive at his conclusion\n\nindependently of any committee.181 Dr Gilbert Lau was unable to say that\n\nit would not be wrong for Dr Lek Se to make the assessment of drowning in the\n\ncircumstances. If Dr Lek Se had said there was copious foam coming out from the nose and\n\nthe mouth of the deceased, he would have given more credence to the diagnosis of drowning\n\nbased purely on an external examination, provided that the possibility of mechanical\n\nasphyxia had been excluded and that, in turn, would require an autopsy.182 There was a difference of medical\n\nopinion as to the significance of the presence of water in the stomach. Some believed\n\nlittle weight could be attached to that fact, others held that as a sign that the person\n\nwas alive when he entered the water. Entry of water into the airways and subsequently the\n\nlungs could occur passively but it would not result in a thick formation of foam as in a\n\nclassical case of drowning.183 Most poisons and drugs would not\n\nproduce external diagnostic changes. Hence the importance of a toxicological analysis. If\n\nthe deceased had been poisoned and died before being put into the water, whether or not\n\nany froth was found at the mouth would depend on whether or not there was water in the\n\nlungs.184 Bruises might occur in the deeper\n\ntissues of the body that would not be visible to the naked eye initially. Severe internal\n\nbruising occurring without external signs was possible. That is why forensic pathologists\n\nhere would examine the body again after the autopsy was done and the organs removed. What\n\nDr Lek Se had done was to do a second external examination of a body which would have\n\nbegun to decompose in the hot weather and that would not be of much value. Dr Lek\n\nSe’s opinion was inconclusive based on very tenuous evidence.185 The Defendants’ second witness\n\nwas Chan Hwee Seng, the Managing Director of Crawford and Co. International Pte Ltd, the\n\nloss adjusters appointed by the Defendants on or about 13 June 1997 to investigate the\n\nclaims lodged by the Plaintiff. He interviewed Lim Chok Young on 30 June 1997, 14 July\n\n1997 and 19 July 1997. Lim Chok Young’s statements made at the interviews were taken\n\ndown in writing and signed by him (Lim Chok Young).186 Chan went to Cambodia on 3 July 1997\n\nto look at room 505 of the Pailin Hotel. He interviewed the two chambermaids who were at\n\nthe scene when the incident occurred on 2 June 1997, the General Manager of the hotel and\n\nthe salesgirl at the photo studio across the road. The results of his investigations were\n\nset out in a Preliminary Report dated 29 July 1997, in which he concluded that the\n\nPlaintiff’s claim was suspicious and stated that his enquiries were by no means\n\ncomplete. A summary from Lim Chok Young’s passport showed that he had made numerous\n\nshort trips of one to two days duration to Malaysia and Indonesia between 1988 and 1997,\n\nwith many of the trips occurring between January and May 1997 (both months included).187 The following were some of the salient\n\npoints made by Lim Chok Young in his statements:(1) \"We moved into our present\n\n  address at Blk 891B Woodland Drive #04-183 which I bought for $130,000. I was residing at\n\n  Blk 252 Hougang Ave 3 #09-340.\"(2) \"In 1996, we moved to the new\n\n  house at (the Woodlands flat).\"(3) \"It was my idea to sublet the\n\n  unit at (the Petir Road flat). The master bedroom was leased to a couple at $600 per\n\n  month. In fact, initially, we leased the whole unit to the couple. However, after protest\n\n  from HDB, we decided to lease the unit partially.\"(4) \"The monthly instalment of (the\n\n  Petir Road flat) is $540 per month for 25 years. My uncle, Lim Mah Chan, stopped work\n\n  about half year ago. He was a heavy smoker and occasionally he requested allowance from\n\n  us. We gave him about $100.00 or less. …… He strike lottery when he initially\n\n  moved into the new unit at Petir Road.\"(5) \"After some thought, I think my\n\n  uncle, Mr Lim Mah Chan, had purchased too many travel insurances. Without my suggestion\n\n  and influence, he will not have bought four travel insurances.\"(6) \"My uncle, Mr Lim Mah Chan, led a\n\n  care-free life style.\"188 In cross-examination, Chan Hwee Seng\n\nexplained that when he travelled to Cambodia on 3 July 1997 Wednesday, he had meant to\n\nstay until Saturday but decided to leave the country on Friday because of the unstable\n\npolitical situation. Although he tried to get in touch with the members of the Cambodian\n\nInvestigation Committee, he was not able to meet them. He took notes of his interviews\n\nwith the two chambermaids whom he met separately, with the hotel’s general manager\n\nacting as interpreter. He did not arrange to have them brought to Singapore for the trial\n\nalthough he had their particulars.189 Chan agreed that the smooth floor\n\ntiles in the toilet of the hotel room in question would be slippery when wet. The hotel\n\nhad central airconditiioning.190 He did not check whether a full\n\nautopsy could be performed in Phnom Penh and neither did he enquire about the cost and the\n\nprocedure of bringing the body back to Singapore.191 He has since done some follow-up work\n\nby checking with the clinics in the neighbourhood where the deceased lived to see if the\n\ndeceased had been there because of any illness. No positive results were obtained. He has\n\nalso gone to Woodlands to check with the neighbours on the relationship between Lim Chok\n\nYoung and the Plaintiff but no one was prepared to come forward to say anything.192 At the interviews with Lim Chok Young,\n\nChan found him cooperative and very forthright in answering his questions. He spoke to Lim\n\nChok Young in Mandarin.193 The loss adjusters wrote to the CID on\n\n12 August 1997 attaching a copy of the said Preliminary Report to see if the matter should\n\nbe referred to the police for further investigation. On 29 August 1997, the CID met the\n\nrepresentative of the loss adjusters and then replied that they had carefully studied the\n\nReport and found that there was insufficient evidence to substantiate any criminal offence\n\nbeing committed and that the CID would not be taking any further action in the matter.\n\nHowever, should the loss adjusters have any further information or evidence indicating any\n\noffence having been committed, they were invited to forward them to the CID for\n\nconsideration.194 Dr Lum Foong Poon, a medical\n\npractitioner having his own clinic, testified that he was an accredited medical examiner\n\nfor various insurance companies in Singapore, among them AIA. The medical records and the\n\nApplication for Life Insurance – Statement to the Medical Examiner Form filled up by\n\nhim on 1 October 1996 showed that he examined the deceased for an insurance application.\n\nThe doctor made the following findings in respect of the deceased after the examination:(1) he was suffering or had suffered from\n\n  syphilis;(2) he suffered from bilateral cataracts,\n\n  with visual acuity at 6/60 uncorrected for both eyes, indicating very poor eyesight;(3) he suffered from skin infection on the\n\n  right forearm probably due to poor hygiene and to scratching;(4) he tested positive for blood in his\n\n  urine, suggesting bleeding from the genito-urinary system, and also had traces of glucose\n\n  in his urine;(5) he was found to have a dropped beat in\n\n  every three to five beats, indicating irregular heartbeats in the sense that there was a\n\n  pause in every three to five beats. Such pause was due to the occurrence of an abnormal\n\n  premature heart beat followed by a compensatory pause. It could occur in a normal person\n\n  and its incidence increased with age. It could be related to over-indulgence in tobacco,\n\n  coffee or alcohol. It could also occur in a person suffering from heart disease.195 Dr Lum went on to say that he would\n\nnormally inform his patients of the positive findings he made. The results of blood tests\n\nwould be ready only after a few days. If there were positive results or unfavourable\n\nfindings from such tests, he would telephone his patients to inform them and to ask them\n\nto return for further evaluation or follow up treatment. He was sure he called the\n\ndeceased but whether the latter made an appointment or not, he was not certain. There were\n\nno subsequent records indicating that the deceased returned to the clinic. He had the\n\ndeceased’s telephone number stated as 7593981 and his address as the Woodlands flat.\n\nHe noted in the form that the deceased was slow in responding to questions, probably due\n\nto his low mentality. He also noted that the deceased behaved older than his age of 60\n\nyears.196 Dr Lum could not remember the language\n\nhe spoke to the deceased in. Physically, the deceased did not look like he was in poor\n\nhealth. There were no signs indicating active syphilis. Nowadays, the third or tertiary\n\nstage, i.e. the worst stage for syphilis, was very rare. That would be when the syphilis\n\nbecame life-threatening. In his opinion, the deceased was probably at the stage between\n\nthe second/secondary and third/tertiary stages during which there would be no symptoms or\n\nsigns at all. It was also possible that he had already been treated. His heart was normal.\n\nNo further test was conducted to determine the cause of the blood in the urine because the\n\ninsurance company did not so instruct and neither did the deceased return for follow-up\n\naction.197 The medical report was not sent to the\n\ndeceased as there was a confidentiality clause protecting against such disclosure. As such\n\ninsurance check-up cases were one-off patients, Dr Lum did not keep a case note like he\n\nwould for other patients.198 Florence Lim Tuan Lien, the Chief\n\nUnderwriting Manager of AIA, testified that the application for insurance form dated 1\n\nOctober 1996 of the deceased showed that he was a self-employed trishaw rider while the\n\nApplication for Life Insurance – Statement to the Medical Examiner Form of the same\n\ndate stated that he was retired. Both had the thumbprint of the deceased. Based on the\n\nmedical findings and Dr Lum’s comment, the insurance company decided to reject the\n\ndeceased’s application for insurance on 17 October 1996. His deposit of $782.40 for\n\nthe payment of premiums was refunded to him by a cheque dated 21 October 1996. The\n\ndeceased was notified by a letter dated 21 October 1996 addressed to the Woodlands flat\n\nindicating that his application was not accepted on account of \"Physical\n\nHistory\".199 Florence Lim clarified under\n\ncross-examination that the letter and the cheque both dated 21 October 1996 were sent to\n\nthe agent for her to forward to the applicant. She was not able to confirm whether the\n\nsaid cheque was presented for payment. She never met the deceased and had no knowledge of\n\nthe circumstances in which the application for insurance was filled up.200 Sim Chye Huat, aged 55, was one of the\n\ntwo witnesses who approached the Defendants’ solicitors during the trial. He\n\ntestified that he had known the deceased since he (Sim) was a little boy. The deceased\n\nused to live at No. 1, Farquhar Street while Sim lived next door at No. 2. Sim’s\n\nsister (now deceased) married Lim Boon Chok who was the deceased’s elder brother. Sim\n\nand the deceased, while they were neighbours in Farquhar Street, used to meet very\n\nregularly. Sim also produced photographs which showed the deceased was at Sim’s\n\nwedding on 26 December 1987.201 The deceased did not have a brother\n\nnamed Lim Ah Khoon (Lim Chok Young’s late father) and neither did he have a nephew\n\ncalled Lim Chok Young. The deceased also never had a sworn brother or a god-daughter.202 After the buildings along Farquhar\n\nStreet were demolished sometime at the end of 1995, the deceased went to stay at the\n\nbusiness premises (Lian Yick Tables and Chairs) of one of the Lim clan members in Defu\n\nLane for a few months. Sim had not heard from or seen the deceased since that time.203 The next time he heard about the\n\ndeceased was in early 1997 when the Chinese newspapers reported that an old man had gone\n\nto Haadyai, lost his passport and was found wondering in the streets there without any\n\nmoney. Sim was told that the deceased was allowed to stay in the Oriental Hotel there for\n\na few days and, because he was carrying a name card of Lian Yick Tables and Chairs, the\n\nmanager of the hotel managed to call the said Singapore business and arrange the\n\ndeceased’s transportation home.204 The next occasion Sim heard about the\n\ndeceased was when he read the report about his death and the present trial in the Chinese\n\nnewspapers of 17 July 2000.205 The deceased was a man of low\n\nmentality, very trusting and gullible. He remained single and had never held a steady job.\n\nHe had worked previously as a trishaw rider. He would be short of money frequently and\n\nwould even go hungry for a few days. He would then approach Sim for some money. Sim\n\nconcluded by saying that, as a relative of the deceased, he was unhappy and angry that\n\nsomeone was passing himself off as the deceased’s nephew.206 In cross-examination, Sim explained\n\nthat after his marriage on 26 December 1987, he moved out of No. 2 Farquhar Street. He\n\nstayed in his brother’s flat in Serangoon and since 1997, has been living in Jurong\n\nWest St. 81. Even after moving out of Farquhar Street, he kept in frequent contact with\n\nthe deceased. The deceased was then a trishaw rider ferrying tourists to Serangoon Road.\n\nHe would also help out at the funeral wakes of relatives as he would be given \"ang\n\npows\". Sim would give him $10 for food each time they met. Most of the\n\ndeceased’s clansmen had already moved out of No. 1 Farquhar Street by then. The\n\ndeceased was occupying the second level of that location which was essentially a\n\ncoolies’ hostel.207 At the end of 1995 to early 1996, the\n\npremises at Farquhar Street were acquired for re-development and were demolished. As the\n\ndeceased had nowhere to stay after the demolition, Sim sent him to his relatives at Lian\n\nYick Tables and Chairs. When they moved there, the deceased had only two packets of\n\nbelongings to bring along. The deceased did not inform Sim before 1995 that he was living\n\nin Hougang, Yishun or Woodlands.208 Sim reiterated that the deceased was\n\nnot a smart person. People nicknamed him \"Suku Bak Chang\" or \"Stupid Meat\n\nDumpling\" (apparently a word play on the deceased’s name). The deceased would\n\nnot scold or beat up people and would not steal. He was basically an honest man although a\n\nlittle greedy because he would buy food for others if given the excess small change.209 Although Sim seldom talked to the\n\ndeceased, he was certain that he did not have a sworn brother or a god-daughter as the\n\ndeceased had never mentioned such to Sim. The deceased also had no close friends. After\n\nSim’s marriage, he would visit the deceased every Saturday afternoon after his work\n\nand on Sundays at Farquhar Street. Sim was sure the deceased was residing there until\n\nend-1995 or early 1996.210 After sending the deceased to his new\n\nhome in the Defu Lane premises at the end of 1995 or early 1996, Sim did not meet the\n\ndeceased again as he was very busy with his work. He gave the deceased $100 for his living\n\nexpenses.211 About a month later, the\n\ndeceased’s relative who owned the Defu Lane premises telephoned Sim to inform him\n\nthat the deceased had a friend living in Yishun who wanted him to stay with him and who\n\nwould help the deceased to find some work. That relative did not know the address or\n\ncontact number of the said friend of the deceased.212 Sim thought that the said friend must\n\nbe up to no good since the deceased was old, jobless and penniless and had skin problems\n\nand poor eyesight. However, he was very busy and was very grateful to that person as it\n\nwould save Sim a lot of money. When Sim met the deceased’s said relative again, Sim\n\nasked him about the deceased but he did not have any information. Even after the deceased\n\nwas brought back to Singapore from Thailand on the occasion where he lost his passport,\n\nneither Sim nor that relative knew where the deceased was staying.213 Sim added in re-examination that the\n\ndeceased was not one who knew how to plan or save money for his future. So long as he had\n\ntens of dollars, he would not want to work. He never had any savings account during the\n\ntime Sim was in contact with him. The deceased never spoke about marriage or starting a\n\nfamily as he could not even support himself.214 Lim Kim Poh, a retiree aged 62, was\n\nthe final witness for the Defendants. She testified that the deceased, who was older than\n\nher by about two years, was adopted by her parents when he was a baby. She had only one\n\nother brother called Lim Boon Chok. Both her parents died decades ago.215 When her only other brother, Lim Boon\n\nChok, died in 1998, no obituary was published. However, when Lim Boon Chok’s wife\n\ndied in January 1992, there was an obituary in the Chinese newspapers. Lim Kim Poh\n\nproduced a copy of the obituary which showed the deceased listed as the subject’s\n\nbrother-in-law.216 Lim Kim Poh went on to state that she\n\nand the deceased grew up together and were close to each other. He would tell her things\n\nand confide in her. However, he had never mentioned any sworn brother or any god-daughter,\n\nsomething he would certainly have told his sister.217 In her assessment, the deceased was\n\nsomeone of low mentality who could not even count money properly and did not know how to\n\nuse a telephone. He was a very trusting person. He remained single and never had a steady\n\njob although he used to work as a trishaw rider. He was always short of money. At times,\n\nhe would go hungry for days, drinking only tap water. He would go to see Lim Kim Poh who\n\nwould give him a few dollars and also some milk to drink. He loved Guinness Stout and\n\nsmoking.218 The last time she saw the deceased was\n\nat the funeral wake of her sister-in-law in January 1992. A few years ago, she received a\n\ncall from a lady telling her that the deceased wished to speak to her. The telephone was\n\nthen passed to the deceased who told his sister that he was staying in Yishun and that\n\nsomeone was providing him with food. When she asked him why he was not working, he replied\n\nthat he was not able to because of his cataracts. Like Sim Chye Huat, she concluded her\n\nAffidavit of Evidence-in-Chief by stating that she was unhappy and angry that someone was\n\npassing himself off as the deceased’s nephew.219 In cross-examination, Lim Kim Poh said\n\nshe married in 1955 and moved out of the family home at No. 1 Farquhar Street. After she\n\nmoved into a HDB flat in 1977, the deceased visited her a few times a year but she did not\n\nvisit him. His last visit should be before the aforesaid funeral wake in January 1992.\n\nLike everyone else, she called the deceased \"Suku Bak Chang\". Prior to that last\n\nmeeting in 1992, the deceased was living in Farquhar Street. She knew that as a fact\n\nbecause she had many relatives who lived there. She could not invite the deceased to live\n\nwith her as her flat was a small one. She did not know whether the deceased was staying in\n\nHougang in late 1992.220 When the deceased telephoned her a few\n\nyears back to tell her he was living in Yishun and that a couple was housing and looking\n\nafter him, she thought that there were many kind people nowadays who would take care of\n\nthe elderly. When she asked for his address in Yishun, he was not able to tell her and so\n\nshe did not go to look for him. The deceased must have obtained her telephone number from\n\nher husband from whom she was separated.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "221 The burden of proof is on the\n\nPlaintiff here to establish that the insured peril occurred and that the deceased died\n\nfrom accidental drowning.222 As indicated earlier, there were three\n\npolicies taken out in the name of the deceased with the Second Defendants. The Personal\n\nAccident Insurance Policy issued on 22 January 1996 for one year and renewed until 21\n\nJanuary 1998 insured the deceased for $20,000 in the event of death. The scope of cover\n\nincluded \"… bodily injury caused by violent accidental external and visible\n\nmeans which is the sole cause of death …\". The Life Assurance Policy issued on\n\n25 January 1996 insured the deceased for 25 years for $7,000 in the event of death. The\n\nTravel Insurance for $200,000 covered \"… bodily injury caused by violent,\n\naccidental, external and visible means which is the sole cause of death …\".223 The First Defendants’ travel\n\ninsurance policy covered death \"caused by an accident, solely and independently of\n\nany other cause\". The Third Defendants’ policy covered death caused solely and\n\ndirectly by accidental means excluding any sickness, disease or medical disorder. The\n\ninsured peril in the Fourth Defendants’ policy was death \"caused by violent,\n\naccidental, external and visible means\". The Fifth Defendants’ policy covered\n\ndeath caused by the sustaining of accidental bodily injury by the deceased.224 With the greatest of respect for the\n\nCambodian Investigation Committee, although the course of action taken by them was\n\nprobably justifiable and acceptable according to their prevailing practice and in the\n\nlight of the circumstances then known to them, their finding that the deceased \"was\n\nreally dead of fainting spell and drowning in the bath tub\" could not be one that was\n\nconclusive on the cause of death. Although they did conduct an external examination of the\n\nbody and studied the surroundings, they probably placed rather too much faith in the\n\nstatements made by Lim Chok Young. I accept Dr Gilbert Lau’s expert evidence that, in\n\nthe absence of an autopsy, the cause of death could not really be ascertained.225 Even if the cause of death was\n\ndrowning, it would not be possible to conclude with any reasonable degree of confidence\n\nthat the deceased had somehow fainted while getting into the bath tub that was being\n\nfilled with water. The deceased was facing downwards in the bath tub with his right arm at\n\nhis back. Even if we ignore the recent minor injuries at the right wrist, the position of\n\nthe right arm would be quite unnatural for someone stepping into a bath tub, fainting and\n\nthen falling forwards into the water. Even if the deceased had regained some consciousness\n\nand was struggling to get back on his feet, it would still be highly improbable that he\n\nwas trying to do so by moving his right arm to his back.226 The absence of signs of forced entry\n\nand of struggle in the hotel room could indicate that there was no forced intrusion into\n\nand no struggle in the room. It could not however eliminate the real possibility that an\n\nassailant had access to the room (whether by possessing a key to the room door or by\n\nentering through the possibly unlocked room door). It could not also eliminate the real\n\npossibility that an assailant had surprised the deceased or was known to the deceased so\n\nthat there would be minimal struggle. Considering the size and the reported weak state\n\nthat the deceased was in prior to his death, there would be little cause for violent\n\nstruggle anyway. Even if a struggle did take place, it would not have been too difficult\n\nto clean up the scene thereafter.227 It was also evident that the use of\n\ndrugs or poison on the deceased could not be ruled out simply by an external examination\n\nof the body at the scene followed by another at the temple a couple of hours later. The\n\nabsence of drugs or poison in the hotel room or its surroundings could at best indicate\n\nthat the deceased did not possess and use such. It could not rule out the possibility that\n\nsome drug or poison was administered to the deceased and the implements subsequently\n\ndisposed of. One could not tell whether the deceased was rendered unconscious or had died\n\nfrom such and was then placed in the bath tub or was rendered so weak that holding his\n\nhead below the water level became easier than trying to keep a plastic ball below water.228 The Investigation Committee’s\n\nfinding that the deceased had fainted, then drowned was also fraught with difficulty. The\n\ndeceased did not appear to have been in poor health before he left for the Cambodian\n\nholiday. The flight to Cambodia could not have been a long one. He arrived on 30 May 1997,\n\njoined the group in the tour of the city on 31 May 1997 and rested on 1 June 1997. Even if\n\nhe was tired, he was apparently well enough to take baths in the bath tub on 31 May 1997\n\nand 1 June 1997, making happy noises in the water at the same time. On 2 June 1997, he was\n\nalso resting in the fully airconditioned hotel after having had his breakfast, light\n\nthough it might have been. Even if his appetite was poor and the incident happened at\n\nclose to lunch time, this was a man accustomed to hunger. He did not leave the hotel at\n\nall on 2 June 1997 and therefore could not have been affected by any heat wave outside. He\n\nwas chatting and watching television in the room with Lim Chok Young for about three\n\nhours. He must have been well for Lim Chok Young to suggest that he take a bath in the\n\nbath tub and then go for lunch three and a half hours after breakfast. He was even smoking\n\na cigarette while waiting for the tub to be filled with water. In those circumstances, it\n\nseems to me highly speculative to conclude that the deceased had a fainting spell. In\n\nfairness to the Investigation Committee, they did not have the advantage of the fuller\n\npicture that emerged in the course of the trial.229 It was therefore not possible to rely\n\non the Investigation Committee’s findings to conclude that death was by drowning and\n\nthat it was accidental.230 I now come to the testimony of the\n\nPlaintiff and Lim Chok Young. It is clear to me that their divorce in 1994 was nothing\n\nmore than a sham. They never ceased to live together as husband and wife even if the\n\nofficial records such as their Identity Cards showed them to have different addresses. The\n\nonly reason the Plaintiff was confused in her testimony about where she was living after\n\nher divorce was because her evidence was concocted and utterly false.231 Earlier on in this judgment (at\n\nparagraph 84,), I set out the particulars given by her in her divorce petition. Lim Chok\n\nYoung was said to have \"neglected the family and never showed any love and\n\nconcern\" for the Plaintiff and their daughter \"throughout the marriage\".\n\nThey married on 6 February 1979. The Petition was filed on 23 May 1994, more than 15 years\n\nlater. Their daughter was born on 16 November 1986, about seven and a half years before\n\nthe filing of the Petition. Lim Chok Young was also said to have behaved very coldly\n\ntowards the Plaintiff since early 1993 and had in fact moved into the other bedroom and\n\nrefused cohabitation. Throughout the seven months between the filing of the Petition and\n\nthe Decree Absolute, Lim Chok Young said in Court, he was trying to reconcile with the\n\nPlaintiff but to no avail. However, the Plaintiff, who affirmed in her Petition that she\n\n\"cannot reasonably be expected to live with\" Lim Chok Young nevertheless\n\ncontinued to live with him even after the Decree Absolute and barely a few months later,\n\nresumed a sexual relationship with him. Immediately after the divorce, Lim Chok Young\n\nsuddenly transformed into a loving father towards the daughter for whom he \"never\n\nshowed any love and concern\" for some seven to eight years. Why should a man like\n\nthat be so shaken by the divorce that he became a changed man almost immediately?232 The charade was made even clearer by\n\nthe Consent Order relating to the division of the matrimonial home. If the family and\n\nhousehold expenses were borne by the Plaintiff, who was not earning a substantial salary\n\nand who would be buying the five-room Woodlands flat on her own, it was indeed surprising\n\nthat the Plaintiff was quite contented to have only her CPF contributions and accrued\n\ninterest back, leaving the erstwhile irresponsible husband and father to benefit from the\n\nenhanced value of the Hougang flat (which left him with enough excess cash to make the\n\ndownpayment for the deceased’s Petir Road flat – but more about that later).\n\nFurther, why then was there a joint account with the POSB which, according to the\n\nPlaintiff, was used by Lim Chok Young all those years to pay the utility bills for the\n\nHougang flat?233 If the Plaintiff and Lim Chok Young\n\nhad practically reconciled by early 1995 (after their divorce in 1994), why was there a\n\nneed for Lim Chok Young to purchase another three-room flat in Yishun? He could have\n\neasily moved to the Woodlands flat with his family – after all, the new flat had\n\nthree bedrooms. There could also be no question of Lim Chok Young having to shift out of\n\nthe Hougang flat because he felt bashful about meeting the Hougang neighbours after the\n\ndivorce since Lim Chok Young and the Plaintiff continued to live as husband and wife in\n\nthe Hougang flat.234 Lim Chok Young’s failure to\n\nmaintain his family since the marriage did not sit well at all with the couple’s\n\notherwise touching story of how they took pity on an elderly relative whom Lim Chok Young\n\nhad not seen for years and provided him with food, lodging and living expenses. It was\n\nalso a glaring omission that no mention of the deceased was made at all in the Petition\n\nwhen he was allegedly one of the main reasons why Lim Chok Young did not spend time with\n\nthe Plaintiff and began to ignore her altogether. Further, despite their professed new\n\nreligious belief and their reconciliation, Lim Chok Young appeared to be carrying on the\n\nvery same \"like father and son\" relationship with the deceased that had\n\ncontributed to the marital break up, spending a lot of time with him and leaving together\n\nfor trips abroad in 1997 without even informing the Plaintiff!235 When the Plaintiff took possession of\n\nthe Woodlands flat in late 1995 or so, one of her first acts was to give a duplicate key\n\nto the flat to Lim Chok Young for the purpose of enabling him to visit their daughter. If\n\ntheir daughter was in the Woodlands flat, why was there a need for Lim Chok Young to have\n\nthe door key? If she was at school, why was Lim Chok Young given such free access to the\n\nWoodlands flat? If the purpose was to enable Lim Chok Young to buy food and to take care\n\nof their daughter, as the Plaintiff always appeared to be very busy at work while Lim Chok\n\nYoung seemed to have so much time on his hands, it was bizarre that Lim Chok Young\n\nreverted to his old, irresponsible ways in 1997 by going abroad for days without even\n\ntelling the Plaintiff so that she could make alternative arrangements for their beloved\n\ndaughter.236 If further evidence of the sham\n\ndivorce is required, it is found in the statements made by Lim Chok Young to the loss\n\nadjusters (see paragraph 187 of this judgment). I repeat them here emphasizing the very\n\ntelling evidence in italics:\"Wemoved intoourpresent address at (the Woodlands flat) whichIbought for $130,000. I was residing\n\n  at (the Hougang flat).\"\"In 1996,wemoved to the new\n\n  house at (the Woodlands flat).\"Do the above statements not support the\n\nclear position that the family never ceased to live together and that they treated the\n\nWoodlands flat as their new home? The couple was never put asunder and there is therefore\n\nno question of their religious belief putting them back together.237 The next question to ask must be, why\n\ndid they go through the charade of a divorce? The answer is simple – money. Under HDB\n\nregulations, the Plaintiff, with the daughter in her custody, was eligible to buy a flat.\n\nLim Chok Young, single after the divorce, was above 35 years in age and could purchase a\n\nthree-room flat on his own account. He knew that these regulations were in existence for\n\nyears and yet pretended to have learned about them only after the divorce. Obviously, one\n\nof the rooms in the Yishun flat was rented out to earn income for Lim Chok Young with the\n\nother room probably used to house the deceased at some point in time. After two and a half\n\nyears of possession, Lim Chok Young would be able to sell the Yishun flat, hopefully for\n\nthe same huge profits that he made from the capital gain on his Hougang flat. I take\n\njudicial notice of the fact that prices for all sorts of real property were in an upswing\n\nin 1993 and 1994. That was why they decided to \"divorce\" in 1994. Unfortunately\n\nfor Lim Chok Young, property prices did not continue their upward swing after 1996 and he\n\nwas lucky to be able to sell the Yishun flat (after the requisite two and a half years of\n\npossession) with some profit.238 The Petir Road flat was acquired by\n\nLim Chok Young in the name of the deceased for the same motives – to earn rental\n\nincome for two and a half years and then sell at a profit. The deceased, like Lim Chok\n\nYoung, met the same eligibility criteria. I accept as a fact that the deceased would never\n\nhave thought of purchasing a flat on his own. He did not have any savings, was unemployed\n\nand was not one given to planning for his future. He could never have afforded the luxury\n\nof owning a flat. The Petir Road flat was, for all intents and purposes, the property of\n\nLim Chok Young who was astute enough to protect his investment by causing the deceased to\n\nmake the will in February 1997, leaving all his earthly possessions to the Plaintiff.\n\nAgain, the deceased was not someone who would have known what a will was, much less\n\nthought about it and then decided to go to town to see a lawyer. The fact that Lim Chok\n\nYoung was willing to have the will name the Plaintiff as the sole beneficiary underlined\n\nonce again the obvious truth – they were never truly divorced. I revert again to\n\nparagraph 187 of this judgment where I set out the statements made by Lim Chok Young to\n\nthe loss adjusters concerning the Petir Road flat. They showed clearly that he was the\n\nbrains behind the acquisition of the Petir Road flat and its use. Due to circumstances\n\nbeyond his control, this flat did not turn out to be a money-spinning venture for him.\n\nProperty prices had dipped or were at best stabilising in 1998 and 1999.239 What sort of persons therefore are the\n\nPlaintiff and her principal witness, Lim Chok Young? They are a couple who were willing to\n\ngo to Court with patently false particulars in the Divorce Petition in order to obtain a\n\nsham divorce for financial gain. Lim Chok Young has demonstrated his acumen in money\n\nmatters. It is in this light that I must now examine their testimony about the deceased\n\nand the insurance policies.240 Firstly, I am willing to accept that\n\nthe deceased could have been the sworn brother of Lim Chok Young’s late father at\n\nsome point in time and that he could have regarded the Plaintiff as his god-daughter.\n\nHowever, I could not accept the assertions that the deceased was with Lim Chok Young and\n\nthe Plaintiff since the late 1980s or that Lim Chok Young had always believed that the\n\ndeceased was related to him by blood.241 As stated earlier, the deceased did\n\nnot feature in the Divorce Petition filed in 1994 although it was said in Court that his\n\nclose relationship with Lim Chok Young was one of the main reasons for the marital break\n\nup. I accept the testimony of Sim Chye Huat that the deceased was living in Farquhar\n\nStreet until about end-1995 when he helped the deceased move to Lian Yick Tables and\n\nChairs in Defu Lane. The Defu Lane industrial estate is practically next door to Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s Hougang flat in Block 252 Hougang Avenue 3. That must be about the time Lim\n\nChok Young came into contact with the deceased. By 1996, Lim Chok Young had the Yishun\n\nflat and he could house the deceased in one of the rooms there. This would also be\n\nentirely consistent with Lim Kim Poh’s evidence that the deceased had called her a\n\nfew years ago to say that he was staying with someone in Yishun.242 The evidence of Ng Guak Chuan (the\n\nadopted sister of Lim Chok Young) appeared to me to be contrived. The name of the deceased\n\nand the date of her visit to Lim Chok Young’s Hougang flat were obviously planted in\n\nher evidence for her. She could not even remember what the deceased looked like or what\n\nhis name was without having been prompted by Lim Chok Young and his mother. Having paid\n\nlittle attention to \"this uncle\" and not having visited Lim Chok Young ever\n\nagain, it was amazing that she could recall \"a thin-looking old man eating rice at\n\nthe table\" twelve years later. She could not even explain the hopelessly inconsistent\n\nstatements in her evidence where she recalled the incident as the first day of Chinese New\n\nYear 12 years ago and then claimed that she \"remembered the year clearly\"\n\nbecause her eldest daughter who was 12 years old then is now 22 years old, a difference of\n\n10 and not 12 years.243 Similarly, Lim Chok Young’s\n\nbrother’s evidence centred on one single incident about nine years ago when he\n\nallegedly met the deceased alone in the Hougang flat. I have serious doubts that such an\n\nincident could have been ingrained so deeply in his memory when he did not talk to Lim\n\nChok Young about it again all these years. It was strange that he never met the deceased\n\nagain since that occasion even if he visited only once a year and it was incredible that\n\nhe did not even ask about the uncle ever again. More fundamentally, Lim Chok Young’s\n\nbrother was 16 when he last saw the deceased 34 years ago at his father’s funeral.\n\nThe deceased would have been 30 years old then. By 1991, when he next saw the deceased,\n\nthe deceased would have been about 55 years old. It was simply incredible that the brother\n\ncould recognize the deceased immediately after all those years.244 Lim Chok Young’s mother’s\n\nevidence did not really assist the Plaintiff or Lim Chok Young. Even if Lim Chok Young did\n\nmention to her that the deceased was staying with him, she could not remember when that\n\nwas. It was unlikely to have been during the time Lim Chok Young was living in the Hougang\n\nflat as he would in all probability have brought the deceased to visit his wheelchair\n\nbound mother who was also living in Hougang Avenue 3 if the deceased had already been\n\nliving in the Hougang flat for several years.245 Therefore the most probable scenario\n\nwas that Lim Chok Young met the deceased sometime in late 1995 or early 1996 and\n\nsubsequently allowed him to stay in one of the two bedrooms in the Yishun flat (which Lim\n\nChok Young did not require as he was living in the Woodlands flat with the Plaintiff and\n\ntheir daughter).246 If the deceased did regard the\n\nPlaintiff as his god-daughter at some point in time, that was surely something suggested\n\nto him by Lim Chok Young for his sinister plans later. The Plaintiff could not have been\n\nclose to the deceased at all. She was apparently too busy to take care of her\n\ndaughter’s meals, much less the deceased’s while he was alive. The deceased was\n\nallegedly coming and going, even travelling out of the country, without so much as a\n\nwhimper to the Plaintiff about his plans. The two men did not even seem to bother to ask\n\nthe Plaintiff and her daughter whether they wished to go on some of the trips. The\n\ndeceased allegedly wanted the Plaintiff to take care of him for the remaining years of his\n\nlife but did not even tell the Plaintiff about his insurance policies and his will or\n\nwhere he had kept them. When Lim Chok Young returned from Cambodia a few days after the\n\ntragic incident with the remains of the deceased, the Plaintiff was too busy with her work\n\nto even accompany Lim Chok Young to lay the remains to rest!247 Lim Chok Young could not have believed\n\nthat the deceased, who was Hokkien, was the blood brother of his father, a Teochew. His\n\nexplanation that the deceased did not seem happy to discuss this matter was nothing more\n\nthan a lame excuse to gloss over the obvious.248 I find that the five travel insurance\n\npolicies in question in this trial were all applied for by Lim Chok Young, with or without\n\nthe presence of the deceased. The deceased was obviously an uneducated and happy-go-lucky\n\nman whose furthest thoughts about the future were probably his next meal and his next\n\ncigarette. He simply had no savings to splash on insurance-shopping or on tours. Insurance\n\nwas already something so foreign to him, what more $1.2 million worth just before a\n\nfive-day trip to Cambodia! I have no hesitation in rejecting Lim Chok Young’s\n\nassertions that the deceased was converted to his deep abiding faith in insurance and that\n\nthe deceased fortuitously came into lottery money just before he became unemployed. The\n\ntruth of the matter was that the deceased was never gainfully employed for any appreciable\n\nperiod of time due to his poor eyesight, low intellect and generally carefree approach to\n\nlife. Getting the deceased’s thumbprint or his handwritten name on application forms\n\nfor insurance would have been as easy as getting the deceased to light up a cigarette. As\n\nwas evident from Lim Chok Young’s own testimony, the insured did not even need to be\n\npresent at the agencies. All the premiums were paid by Lim Chok Young who needed no\n\nreimbursement as the policies were his idea anyway and they were small change compared to\n\nwhat he hoped to reap in the subsequent insurance claims.249 It was absurd that such a staunch\n\nbeliever in insurance as Lim Chok Young was able to go around town leisurely amassing\n\ninsured sums for the deceased, right up to three days before departure on the tour, but\n\nwould forget the contact cards of the insurance companies when packing. He seemed to have\n\nso much free time buzzing in and out of tour agencies in town. One wonders how long he\n\nneeded to pack for that short trip anyway.250 According to the Plaintiff and Lim\n\nChok Young, by early 1997, they were a couple experiencing a second spring of love. Lim\n\nChok Young’s former cold front must have melted in the warmth of their renewed love.\n\nYet the Plaintiff would have everyone believe that Lim Chok Young and the deceased were\n\ncarrying on as before, surreptitiously planning trips abroad and disappearing for days\n\nwithout so much as a little note on the refrigerator door to inform the Plaintiff of their\n\nwhereabouts. I find her evidence on this utterly unbelievable.251 The evidence of Lim Chok Young\n\nrelating to the three AIA applications which were subsequently rejected was so patently\n\nand pathetically false. As said earlier, the deceased was not someone who would be\n\nplanning for his future financial needs in this way in the first place. If the deceased\n\nwas not at the Woodlands flat but at the Petir Road flat, why could not Lim Chok Young\n\nsimply re-direct the insurance agents there? Was he someone who was likely to be cowed by\n\ntwo insurance agents who refused to leave the flat unless some business was transacted?\n\nClearly not. The deceased was portrayed as someone with ample cash to spare, who was\n\nwilling to \"oblige\" two agents not at his flat by buying $300,000 in insurance\n\nwithout even knowing what sort of policy it was. Clearly, Lim Chok Young was again lying\n\nin this matter. He had arranged the insurance himself.252 I now come to the fateful day of 2\n\nJune 1997 in room 505, Pailin Hotel, Phnom Penh. If the deceased had lost his appetite for\n\na couple of days, it was indeed strange that Lim Chok Young should arrange lunch to be at\n\n12 noon when they had finished breakfast at 8.30 am, only three and a half hours earlier.\n\nFurther, since the deceased did not leave the fully airconditioned hotel on 1 June 1997\n\nand 2 June 1997 and was not feeling well, why would he be taking a bath just before lunch?\n\nIt could not be because he was feeling hot. If Lim Chok Young merely wanted him to freshen\n\nup and feel better, knowing that it would take time to fill the bath tub and aware of the\n\nslow movements of the deceased, why suggest taking a bath – not a shower – when\n\nit was already 11.30 am and they were to meet at the lobby at 12 noon?253 The way the deceased was found lying\n\nin the flooded bath tub certainly did not suggest that he had fallen into the water,\n\nwhether because of a fainting spell or otherwise. The unnatural position of his right arm\n\nsuggested strongly that it had been held at his back by someone. As stated earlier, the\n\ndeceased was a man accustomed to hunger and it was highly unlikely that his poor appetite\n\n– if he ever had a good one – had affected him to such an extent. Further, Lim\n\nChok Young’s ridiculous additional evidence in the witness box about the possibility\n\nof the deceased wanting to splash water on him did not help the Plaintiff’s case at\n\nall.254 Once the entire chain of events and\n\nall the surrounding circumstances were considered together, rather than as isolated,\n\nunrelated parts, I could only arrive at the irresistible conclusion that Lim Chok Young\n\nand his wife, the Plaintiff, driven by their determination to become rich, conspired to\n\ncause the death of the deceased intentionally in order to benefit from the insurance\n\nmonies. Lim Chok Young was the prime mover of the whole scheme. Even if the Plaintiff was\n\nnot aware of the exact details of the plot to extinguish the life of the deceased, she\n\nobviously knew that an \"accident\" of some sort had been planned for the poor\n\nsimpleton abroad.255 The trips by Lim Chok Young and the\n\ndeceased to neighbouring countries between February and May 1997 were nothing more than a\n\nploy by Lim Chok Young to create the impression that they were constant, merry travelling\n\ncompanions. The trips were not made in order that a kind and altruistic \"nephew\"\n\ncould fulfil his aging uncle’s wish to travel by aeroplane – they were flights\n\nin the final journey leading to the eventual designated place of execution. Lim Chok Young\n\nalso did not want an autopsy to be conducted here for it might reveal the actual cause of\n\ndeath of the deceased. For this reason, he chose to forget all about the precious\n\ninsurance policies taken out to cover both of them in such an \"emergency\" and\n\nneglected to inform the insurance companies, thereby depriving them of the opportunity to\n\ndecide on repatriation of the body.256 Insofar as the deceased’s death\n\nwas not accidental, it was not covered by the policies concerning accidental death. In\n\nrespect of the policies covering death from any cause, violent or otherwise, public policy\n\nmust surely prevent the Plaintiff from claiming any money thereunder. As a fellow\n\nconspirator, the Plaintiff’s hands were as stained with blood as Lim Chok\n\nYoung’s. No one should be permitted to benefit directly or indirectly from his/her\n\nown wrong. Certainly no killer should be allowed to come to Court to collect blood money.\n\nThis is so even if I am wrong in finding that the Plaintiff was involved in the said\n\nconspiracy. If the Plaintiff was innocent, it would still be wrong to allow her to benefit\n\nfrom her husband’s criminal conduct as that would condone the criminal act done for\n\nthe sake of benefiting his family. That assumes that Lim Chok Young would not be\n\nbenefiting from the insurance monies. However, public policy applies with even greater\n\nforce here as Lim Chok Young would obviously have a share of the insurance monies if they\n\nwere paid out to the Plaintiff. He has agreed that would be so and the pay out of $100,000\n\nby GE Life put it beyond all doubt that both husband and wife would benefit jointly.257 I now deal with the secondary issues\n\nin this case. The first is whether there was material non-disclosure by the deceased\n\ninsured in respect of his health problems as revealed in the medical examination in\n\nOctober 1996 by Dr Lum Foong Poon and the subsequent rejection of his application for\n\ninsurance by AIA.258 It is trite law that a contract of\n\ninsurance is one of utmost good faith and that an applicant for insurance is under a duty\n\nto disclose all information which a prudent insurer would consider material. Such a duty\n\nexists regardless of whether the insured has been asked to complete a proposal form or\n\nwhether he has been asked any other questions by the insurer (The Asia Insurance Co Ltd\n\nv Tat Hong Plant Leasing Pte Ltd[1992] 1 CLJ 330at page 335).259 The insurance policies that came into\n\nbeing after October 1996 were the five travel insurance policies in issue in this case.\n\nThese policies insured generally against death or injury from violent or accidental means.\n\nThey excluded causes such as sickness, disease or medical disorder. It could not therefore\n\nbe said that the deceased’s state of health would have mattered to the insurers here\n\nand, consequently, the rejection of the October 1996 application on this ground. Insurers\n\nissuing travel insurance policies would only be interested in the personal particulars of\n\nthe proposed insured, the proposed destination(s), the total period of travel and perhaps\n\nthe purpose of travel. This was borne out in practice in the instances mentioned in this\n\ncase. One could easily buy travel insurance without being physically present at the\n\nagencies. It is also axiomatic that violent acts and accidents could happen to anyone\n\nwhether in the pink of health or weak and sickly. What may be material is how careful or\n\ncareless a person is, not how healthy or diseased he is.260 The second issue concerns the First\n\nDefendants’ policy, Clause 7 of which provided that the insured person could only be\n\ncovered under one such policy for the same trip whereas the deceased was covered by four\n\nother such policies. Further, Clause 1 of the said policy provided that the insured must\n\nbe fit to travel and not be aware of any circumstances which could lead to the\n\ncancellation or disruption of the trip. It was provided in the General Conditions that\n\ncompliance with the terms was a condition precedent to any liability of the insurers.261 The Defendants submitted that the\n\nCambodian Investigation Committee’s reports indicated that the deceased’s health\n\nwas not good since his arrival in Phnom Penh. In addition, the deceased had missed the\n\ntour on 1 June 1997. The Defendants therefore argued that the deceased had breached\n\nClauses 1 and 7.262 With respect, I disagree. The deceased\n\nmight have been tired or lost his appetite after travelling to Cambodia but these facts\n\ndid not imply that he was therefore not fit to travel. Anybody could become tired or feel\n\nqueasy while on tour without being unfit to travel. Where Clause 7 is concerned, there is\n\nno reason to read it broadly as preventing insured persons from buying further insurance\n\nfrom others if they so wish. \"One such policy for the same trip\" could be read\n\nmeaningfully as only one travel insurance policy from the First Defendants.263 The Defendants further contended that\n\nthe First, Third, Fourth and Fifth Defendants were deprived of their contractual right to\n\nconduct a post mortem examination or autopsy of the body by the failure to inform them of\n\nthe death and by the cremation on 4 June 1997. The Plaintiff argued that the term in the\n\npolicies relating to this (expressed in various terminology) did not go so far as to state\n\nthat unless the Defendants had an opportunity to do a post mortem examination, they would\n\nnot be liable. The Plaintiff contended the relevant term merely reserved the right of the\n\ninsurers to do a post mortem examination if they so wished.264 A reservation of a right necessarily\n\nimplies a duty to inform coupled with the giving of a reasonable opportunity to examine.\n\nThere would be nothing left of the right if the insurers were not informed of the death at\n\nall before cremation took place. Similarly the right would be a wholly illusory one if\n\nnotice of the death was given minutes before the body was turned into ashes. Where the\n\npolicy provides for a period within which notice must be given of any bodily injury or of\n\ndeath, that period can only begin to run from the time an opportunity arises for the\n\ngiving of notice. Say, for instance, an insured were trekking in jungles and got injured\n\nin some remote, deserted area without a cellular telephone. It would be absurd to require\n\nnotice, especially a written one, to be given immediately or even within one week if the\n\nrescue team could only reach the injured and return him to civilization after that period.\n\nThis must apply with even greater logical force to a case where death has unfortunately\n\noccurred because the party informing the insurers about the death would obviously not be\n\nthe insured! In the same example given, death could have occurred without anyone\n\ndiscovering it for some period of time. Further, if the body was cremated by some third\n\nparty or was somehow lost or destroyed, there could be no question of breach of any term\n\npertaining to the insurers’ right to repatriate and to perform an autopsy because\n\nthat would be compelling the impossible to be done.265 Coming back to the facts of this case,\n\nLim Chok Young could not plead that he was unaware of the policies in the deceased’s\n\nname. He had access to telecommunication facilities and to assistance from the Singapore\n\nEmbassy in Phnom Penh. He even spoke twice to the Plaintiff who was in Singapore. He and\n\nthe Plaintiff had every opportunity of informing any of the five insurers to seek their\n\nadvice or instructions on the repatriation of the body or its disposal but they did not do\n\nso. It was not a situation where the Cambodian authorities had ordered a cremation to be\n\ndone immediately or at all. The cremation was Lim Chok Young’s and the\n\nPlaintiff’s considered decision. In such circumstances, they have deprived the\n\ninsurers of their contractual right to examine the body or to bring it to Singapore or\n\nelsewhere for an autopsy to be conducted. The insurers were therefore entitled to deny\n\nliability on this ground as there was a breach of a condition precedent.",
        "THE CONCLUSION": "266 The Plaintiff’s claim against all\n\nfive Defendants must therefore fail. As I ruled against the Defendants’ contentions\n\nin respect of two of the secondary issues, I ordered the Plaintiff to pay 90% of the costs\n\nof this action, to be taxed or agreed.Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
