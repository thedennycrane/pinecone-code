        "Introduction": "1 In this application, the first applicant, Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin (“Mr Fu”), sought to have a company, Authorities Services Pte Ltd (“ASPL”), which he had previously applied to strike off the register of companies (the “Register”), restored to the Register (the “Application”). The purpose of restoration was to enable Mr Fu, the sole director and shareholder of ASPL, to use the company as a vehicle for investments. After considering the arguments put before me, I found that Mr Fu hadlocus standito bring this Application and that it was just to order the restoration. Therefore, I granted the application.",
        "Facts": "",
        "The parties": "2 The first applicant was Mr Fu, a Singaporean, who was at all times the sole director and shareholder of ASPL.1Foot Note 1×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 8. 3 The second applicant, ASPL, was a company incorporated by Mr Fu in Singapore on 16 October 2015. Mr Fu set up ASPL to provide consultancy services.2Foot Note 2×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at paras 6–7. 4 The respondent was the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”).",
        "Background": "5 On 8 February 2011, Mr Fu established a company, AF Holdings Pte Ltd (“AFH”). AFH provided, and continues to provide, real estate agency services.3Foot Note 3×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 5.On 16 October 2015, Mr Fu incorporated ASPL to provide consultancy services under a separate business. 6 In or around December 2018, Mr Fu decided to focus on his real estate agency business in AFH and cease offering consultancy services through ASPL. Since Mr Fu no longer required ASPL, in or around December 2018, Mr Fu, in his capacity as director of ASPL, applied to ACRA under s 344A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) for ASPL to be struck off.4Foot Note 4×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at paras 10–11.Pursuant to that application, on 7 March 2019, ASPL was struck off the Register.5Foot Note 5×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 5.At the time of striking off, ASPL had no assets and no liabilities.6Foot Note 6×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at paras 13 and 15.Since ASPL had been struck off the Register at the time of this Application, it cannot be an applicant in this action: see s 2(1) of the Interpretation Act 1965 (2020 Rev Ed) andReHaeusler, Thomas[2021] 4 SLR 1407 at [35]. Mr Fu is therefore the sole applicant. 7 On 29 December 2022, Mr Fu filed the present Application for ASPL to be restored to the Register, pursuant to s 344(5) of the Companies Act 1967 (2020 Rev Ed)(the “Companies Act”).7Foot Note 7×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 1.This is because Mr Fu sought to use ASPL as a vehicle to make investments,8Foot Note 8×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at paras 18–20; Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 6.and claimed that restoring ASPL to the Register required less time and lower costs than incorporating a new company.9Foot Note 9×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 19.",
        "The parties’ cases": "8 Mr Fu relied on the framework for restoration of a company to the Register set outin Re AsiaPetan Organisation Pte Ltd[2018] 3 SLR 435 (“Re AsiaPetan”) at [31]. 9 Mr Fu argued that he hadlocus standito make the Application, notwithstanding that he had applied for ASPL to be struck off the Register. Mr Fu relied on cases includingGanesh Paulraj v Avantgarde Shipping Pte Ltd[2019] 4 SLR 617 (“Ganesh”) and ReBlenheim Leisure (Restaurants) Ltd (No 2)[2000] BCC 821 (“Re Blenheim”). Mr Fu submitted that he was “the sole shareholder of ASPL and [had] an interest in restoring the company so that it may be used to make investments”.10Foot Note 10×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 16. 10 Moreover, Mr Fu argued that it would be “just” to restore ASPL to the Register because Mr Fu may thereby use ASPL to carry out investments, and this would confer Mr Fu the practicable benefit of saved time and costs of incorporating a new company.11Foot Note 11×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 18.Mr Fu claimed that ASPL had not been involved in any disputes with other parties and had no financial or tax problems.12Foot Note 12×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 19; Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 19.Additionally, there would be no prejudice to any party. Mr Fu asserted that “ASPL ha[d] no debts or liabilities, and there [we]re no unresolved claims or pending proceedings against it”.13Foot Note 13×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 19.He also “agreed to make any undertakings required, including bringing ASPL’s annual returns up to date.”14Foot Note 14×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 19. 11 This Application was unopposed. ACRA had been informed of the application to restore but did not participate in the present proceedings.15Foot Note 15×Applicants’ written submissions dd 13 January 2023 at para 3 and Annex 1.",
        "Issues to be determined": "12 In making my decision, I considered the following issues: (a) Whether Mr Fu, notwithstanding that he was the party who applied for ASPL to be struck off, had sufficient standing to make the present application. (b) Whether any practicable benefit would arise from the restoration of ASPL to the Register.",
        "The law governing restoration": "13 Section 344(5) of the Companies Act governs the restoration of companies struck off the Register, and it is reproduced below: Ifany personfeelsaggrieved by the name of the company having been struck off the[R]egister, the Court, on an application made by the person at any time within 6 years after the name of the company has been so struck off may,if satisfiedthatthe company was, at the time of the striking off, carrying on business or in operation or otherwisethat it is just that the name of the company be restored to the[R]egister, order the name of the company to be restored to the [R]egister … [emphasis added] It is part of s 344, which empowers the Registrar of Companies (the “Registrar”) to strike off a company which the Registrar has reason to believe is no longer carrying on business or not in operation (Re AsiaPetanat [15]). 14 Conversely, s 344A of the Companies Act came into force on 3 January 2016 and empowers the Registrar to strike off a company on the application of the company. Section 344A was the legal provision on which basis Mr Fu had applied to strike off ASPL. InRe AsiaPetan, at [16], the Honourable Judicial Commissioner Audrey Lim (as she then was) held that s 344(5) of the Companies Act is a general provision empowering the court to restore a company that was previously struck off by virtue of its own application, notwithstanding the fact that s 344A of the Companies Act does not contain a provision similar to that in s 344(5) of the Companies Act to restore a company. Mr Fu was therefore able to rely on s 344(5) of the Companies Act in this case, since it involved ASPL, a company struck off under s 344A of the Companies Act. 15 In order to restore a defunct company under s 344(5) of the Companies Act, the statute provides that an applicant must satisfy three requirements: (a) First, the applicant must be an “aggrieved person” (the “Locus StandiRequirement”). (b) Second, the application must be made within six years after the defunct company was struck off. The Application satisfied this requirement. (c) Third, the court must be satisfied that: (i) at the time of striking off, the company was carrying on business or in operation; or (ii) it is just that the name of the company be restored to the Register (the “Just Requirement”). 16 InRe AsiaPetan, Lim JC set out several principles for the determination of whether theLocus StandiRequirement and the Just Requirement (collectively, the “Requirements”) were satisfied (Re AsiaPetanat [31]). Subsequently, inGanesh, the Honourable Justice Aedit Abdullah  agreed with these principles and provided further guidance (Ganeshat [13]). I summarise and apply these principles when considering each Requirement, in turn.",
        "The Locus Standi Requirement": "",
        "The law": "27 To fulfil the Just Requirement, the court should have regard to all the circumstances of the case, including but not limited to: “(a) the purpose of restoring the company; (b) whether there would be any practicable benefit arising from the restoration; and (c) whether there would be prejudice to any persons” (Re AsiaPetanat [31]). Finally, “if the court were so satisfied, it should order a restoration unless there are exceptional countervailing circumstances” (Re AsiaPetanat [31]). Subsequently, inGanesh, Abdullah J clarified that these factors are not exhaustive and conclusive (Ganeshat [13]). 28 InRe AsiaPetan, an application for restoration was brought by a former shareholder and director of a company that had been struck off. The purpose of the application was to commence a derivative action in the company’s name against another director under s 216A of the Companies Act for breach of that other director’s fiduciary duties as a director (Re AsiaPetanat [4]). Lim JC found that any delay in bringing the restoration application did not cause prejudice to the allegedly errant director and that there was no other evidence of any prejudice or detriment that a third party might suffer if the company were restored (Re AsiaPetanat [37]). Therefore, considering all the circumstances of the case, she found it just to order the restoration of the company and allowed the application. 29 Subsequently, in the case ofGanesh, the applicant’s company (“Tuff”) and the respondent were the two shareholders of the company that had been struck off the Register (the “Company”) (Ganeshat [2]). Before the Company was struck off, the respondent entered into a contract with the Company for the provision of integrated project management services (the “Integrated Project Management Services Contract”). According to the applicant, the Company then entered into a back-to-back contract with Tuff for the same scope of work set out in the Integrated Project Management Services Contract. While the Company was the contracting party under the Integrated Project Management Services Contract, Tuff performed the actual work and received payment from the respondent. As a result of the apparent redundancy, an application was made for the Company to be struck off the Register. After the Company was struck off, it transpired that there remained an outstanding sum purportedly owed by the respondent to Tuff. According to the applicant, restoration of the Company was necessary to vindicate the applicant’s contractual claim (Ganeshat [4]). 30 The High Court found that the purpose of the Company’s restoration was to enable the pursuit of the contractual claim against the respondent. This was held to confer sufficient practical benefit, even if the contractual claim were unmeritorious, so long as it was not hopeless or very likely to fail (Ganeshat [24]–[25]). Further, the respondent’s exposure to the contractual claim would not count as relevant prejudice. The claim arose independently and did not lead to any new consequences for the respondent, and the respondent would have had to face the claim had the Company continued its existence (Ganeshat [27]). Additionally, the fact that the applicant had himself sought to strike off the Company in the first place did not negate any practical benefit from the restoration (Ganeshat [29]). Accordingly, the court granted the order sought by the applicant (Ganeshat [32]). 31 Mr Fu’s counsel also referred to the case ofReBlenheim.Re Blenheimconcerned a members’ application for the restoration of a company under s 635(2B) of the UK Companies Act 1985, which is worded similarly to s 344(5) of the Companies Act. The company had entered into agreements with the second respondent for the rent of three clubs. Subsequently, the company entered into agreements with a third company for the rent of the same three clubs for a higher rent (Re Blenheimat 821). Thereafter, on the mistaken advice of auditors, who had wrongly believed that the company had no assets, the same applicants for restoration made the application for striking off (Re Blenheimat 833). When the applicants later made their application for restoration, the court held that it was just to allow the company to be restored to the companies register. The most crucial factor to the court in arriving at that decision was the prospect of the company being solvent (although this was a highly speculative prospect, albeit not a fanciful one), which meant thatrestoration could produce something of value to the applicants(ie,the company’s shareholders) in the form of monies allegedly owed through the agreements (Re Blenheimat 834). The court also considered that the prejudice suffered by the respondents (ie,delays resulting from the application) did not outweigh the prospects of value being established, taking into account the sums owed by the company to the respondents, and the sums owed to the company for rents in the later arrangements (Re Blenheimat 835–836).",
        "The decision": "32 The core issue, in this case, was whether, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, it was just for ASPL to be restored to the Register. 33 InGaneshandRe Blenheim, the courts considered it just to restore the respective companies primarily to retain some benefit or value that would otherwise have been lost. InGanesh, the practicable benefit was the possibility of claiming the debt owed to the Company. InRe Blenheim, the benefit was the prospect of preserving value arising from the company’s agreements. Each of these cases presented a good basis for restoration. However, the question here was: what value was preserved by ordering the restoration of ASPL? In my judgment, the present facts crossed the boundary of establishing the Just Requirement, if only barely so. Practicable benefit 34 InRe AsiaPetan(at [31]), Lim JC did not specify that the practicable benefit arising from the restoration mustaccrue to thecompanybeing restored. In my view, there is nothing to preclude a benefit to be enjoyed by Mr Fu in the analysis of practicable benefit arising from the restoration of ASPL. In my view, the restoration of ASPL would have the following practicable benefits: Mr Fu has given affidavit evidence that he intends to use ASPL as a vehicle to carry out various investments.16Foot Note 16×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 18.Allowing a restoration of ASPL, as opposed to having to incorporate a new company, would likely confer Mr Fu the tangible benefit of time and cost savings. Consequently, the saved time would enable Mr Fu to commence business activity earlier. Additionally, the practicable benefits could extend beyond Mr Fu: if ASPL succeeds in its investments, it would have the potential to add value to the local economy and generate employment. 35 My decision was guided in part by the liberal approach taken in the line of Singapore authorities. InRe AsiaPetan(at [27]), Lim JC cited Lord Hoffmann of Chedworth’s statement inRe Forte’s (Manufacturing) Ltd Stanhope Pension Trust Ltd v Registrar of Companies[1994] BCC 84 (“Re Forte’s”)at 90A–90B that “the interest of an applicant under s 651 [of the UK Companies Act 1985] in having thecompany revived does not have to be firmly established or highly likely toprevail.It is sufficient that it is not ‘merely shadowy’”[emphasis added]. Lim JC found that the principle enunciated therein applied to applications under s 344(5) of the Companies Act. Therefore, only a more than “merely shadowy” threshold is required to establish the Just Requirement. Further, inGanesh, Abdullah J held that the purpose of pursuing a contractual claim against the respondent in that case would confer sufficient practical benefit, even if the contractual claim were unmeritorious, so long as the claim was not hopeless (Ganeshat [24]). Therefore, it appeared that a liberal view was taken in the case law when applying the Just Requirement. 36 Further, I was satisfied that there are safeguards to prevent applicants from frivolously and haphazardly applying to strike a company off the Register and subsequently applying to have it restored. First, the reduced limitation period for restoration under s 344(5) of the Companies Act provides a safeguard. Prior to the Companies (Amendment) Act 2014 (“Amd Act 2014”) coming into force on  3 January 2016, a company could be restored to the Register within 15 years if the court is satisfied that the company had been carrying on its business or remained in operation or otherwise that it was just for the company to be restored to the Register: see the Ministry of Finance’s Consultation Paper in June 2011 on the Report of the Steering Committee for Review of the Companies Act (the “2011 Consultation Paper”) at ch 5 [75]. However, s 344(5) of the Companies Act has since been amended by the Amd Act 2014, according to which an applicant must make a restoration applicationwithinsix yearsafter the name of the company has been struck off the Register. This would prevent frivolous applications made to restore a company long after the company has been struck off the Register. It would also shorten the waiting time for any interested person to use an identical name of the struck-off company to register a new entity: see the 2011 Consultation Paper at ch 5 [75]. 37 Second, under s 344(5) of the Companies Act, anyone who wants to restore a company has to engage the services of a lawyer and file an application to court, which may be costly and time consuming. The Steering Committee in the 2011 Consultation Paper recognised that “[h]aving to apply to the court for the restoration of a company is a form of deterrence for frivolous applications” (2011 Consultation Paper at ch 5 [78]–[79]); they also pointed out that the operation of this safeguard was exemplified by the limited number of companies that had previously applied to be restored to the Register. Prejudice to third parties 38 Finally, I was satisfied that the restoration of ASPL would cause no prejudice to any third party. Furthermore, ACRA made no objections to the present application. I also considered that Mr Fu had agreed to make any undertakings to bear the costs incurred by ACRA for the purposes of restoring ASPL to the Register.17Foot Note 17×Mr Fu Zhihui Alvin’s affidavit dd 28 December 2022 at para 23(b). 39 In the circumstances, I was satisfied that it was just for ASPL to be restored to the Register and found that there were no exceptional countervailing circumstances to decide otherwise.",

        "Conclusion": "40 Accordingly, I granted the order sought by Mr Fu. Lee Seiu Kin JJudge of the High Court Foo Chuan Min Jerald and Luis Inaki Duhart Gonzalez (Selvam LLC) for the applicant."
