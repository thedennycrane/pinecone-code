        "The facts": "5 In late September 1995 Panatron entered\n\ninto a licence agreement with Chemtour, the sole-proprietorship of Dettrick, for Panatron\n\nto manufacture and market waterproof paints and coatings in Singapore and the region. Such\n\npaints and coatings use chemical sealants. Panatron were introduced to Nuplex by Dettrick.\n\nNuplex’s related company in Australia had been supplying the chemical resins,\n\nchemically known as \"Viscopol 140\" (code-named PANVL) and \"Texicryl\n\n13031\"( code-named CHEMTEX, to Dettrick’s companies.6 Panatron started production in early\n\nJanuary 1996. They also started to purchase the two chemical resins from Nuplex. Each\n\nshipment was carried out in the following manner. Panatron’s plant manager or the\n\nSenior Vice-President, Peter Yin (\"Yin\") who gave evidence in this case for\n\nNuplex and who was one of the conspirators named by Panatron in the other suit, would\n\ncomplete a purchase requisition for the amount of resins needed. It was usually a full\n\ncontainer load (\"FCL\"). The President of Panatron, Phua Mong Seng\n\n(\"Phua\"), who gave evidence for Panatron, would approve and issue the purchase\n\norder. The purchase order set out the terms of each purchase, stating the mode of payment\n\nfor the resins (which was usually by means of a letter of credit) at the prevailing quoted\n\nprice, and the estimated time of arrival of the resins. The purchase order would then be\n\nfaxed to Nuplex who indicated their agreement by signing at the indicated portion and\n\nfaxing it back to Panatron. Nuplex would then ship the goods to Panatron CIF Singapore. At\n\nintervals of about every quarter, Nuplex would send to Panatron the revised prices for\n\ntheir products. On the face of it, each sale and purchase of the chemical resins was\n\npursuant to a separate and discrete contract.7 On 6 August 1996 Yin met the Export\n\nManager of Nuplex, Tony Leggett (\"Leggett\") for the first time when the latter\n\nvisited them in Singapore. Yin was instructed by Phua to arrange for Nuplex to place a\n\n\"consignment\" stock of the goods. The presence of such a stock of the resins\n\nwould prevent any disruption of the manufacturing process, quite apart from not having to\n\npay for them just yet. The terms of the agreement were indicated in a fax dated 7 August\n\n1996 which Nuplex sent to Panatron. The Fax was in these terms:\"FURTHER TO YOUR DISCUSSION WITH MR\n\n  LEGGETT HE HAS ADVISED THAT WE HAVE AGREED TO SEND 1 FCL TO YOU AS CONSIGNMENT STOCK.\n\n  PLEASE BE ADVISED OF THE FOLLOWING TERMS FOR CONSIGNMENT STOCK;CONSIGNMENT STOCK WILL REMAIN THE PROPERTY\n\n  OF NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD UNTIL SUCH TIME AS IT IS MUTUALLY AGREED TO TERMINATE THIS\n\n  ARRANGEMENT. AT SUCH TIME PANATRON PTE LTD WILL PAY NUPLEX INDUSTRIES LTD FOR THIS STOCK\n\n  AT THE MARKET PRICE PREVAILING AT THE TIME.CAN YOU PLEASE CONFIRM BY RETURN THAT YOU\n\n  ARE AGREEABLE TO THE ABOVE TERMS….\"The fax then went on to discuss the\n\narrangements for the shipment of the next three full container loads under apparently 3\n\ncontracts for the sales of goods.8 By a letter transmitted on 9 August 1996\n\nto Nuplex, Panatron referred to the fax and went on to state as follows:\"I confirm the following\n\n  understanding:1. The 1 x FCL consignment stock will\n\n  remain the property of Nuplex Industries Ltd.2. Panatron Pte Ltd will pay for the\n\n  consignment stock at the prevailing market price at the end of this arrangement.I will send you a P.O. for the\n\n  abovementioned FCL and advise the desired shipment ETA date.\"9 By a Purchase Order of 14 August 1996\n\nPanatron specified the details of the consignment stock required. They required 24x200kg\n\ndrums of PanVL (4.8 Mtons) and 72x200kg (14.4 Mtons). It noted as follows:\n\n‘CONSIGNMENT STOCK’ and the further notation was: \"No value or price\n\nattached as this shipment is for consignment only.\" Under the Terms and Conditions,\n\nthe following were agreed:\"Prices : CIF Singapore, based on\n\n  prevailing product prices at the time of the termination of the consignment agreement.Terms : L/C 60 days from the consignment\n\n  agreement termination date.…ETA\n\n          : Singapore 20 September 1996\"10 By early September 1996 it became\n\napparent that the 1 full container loan of chemical resins, which could meet\n\nPanatron’s manufacturing needs for about a month, was insufficient. Phua then\n\ninstructed Yin to obtain from Nuplex a second FCL buffer stock. Yin obtained\n\nLeggett’s agreement and the second buffer 1 FCL buffer stock was sent.11 On 23 August 1997 Dettrick terminated\n\nthe Licence Agreement with Panatron for the reasons mentioned in the other judgment. After\n\nthe cancellation of the licence Panatron were no longer authorised to manufacture the\n\nChemtour products of Dettrick. Panatron therefore no longer had any need to use PANVL or\n\nCHEMTEX.12 By a letter of 10 September 1997 signed\n\nby Yin, Panatron informed Nuplex of the amount of resins still held by the defendants and\n\ninquiring whether Nuplex wished to invoice Panatron for the amount of the buffer stock\n\nused to date. As for the balance of the stock, Yin asked whether he wanted to invoice\n\nPanatron for the balance, nominate a third party and assign them the rights to the stock,\n\nor dispose of it in any other way. He concluded by stating: \"As the stock with\n\nPanatron rightfully belongs to and is the property of Nuplex, I await your feedback on how\n\nyou (as the owner’s representative) wish to proceed…\" Yin explained in\n\nevidence that he wrote in this way, although Panatron was obliged to pay, because he was\n\nhoping that Nuplex would pick one of the other options he suggested. Nuplex’s\n\nresponse was to request for the payment of US$12,468 for the stock used. As for the\n\nbalance of the unused stock, Nuplex said they would revert after they had found a\n\nwarehouse. No payment was made by Panatron.",
        "The factual issues": "13 Phua in his evidence claims that the\n\nintroduction of Nuplex to Panatron in August/September 1995 to supply of the unique\n\nchemicals was \"part of the technology transfer\" by Dettrick under the Licence\n\nAgreement for Panatron’s manufacture of the products known as NewFlex, NewFlex R100,\n\nFlexicote, BlockFlex, Primer and Tuffcote. He further alleges that Nuplex (without naming\n\nanybody from Nuplex) and Dettrick \"represented to Panatron at the time of the\n\nintroduction that the chemicals were vital resin for Panatron’s manufacture of the\n\nproducts \"and also stated that (Nuplex) shall supply on a long term basis.\"\n\nPhua, as if to fortify his assertions, claims that the chemical resins \"are unique in\n\nnature and substance\" which Panatron would need on a long term basis to enable them\n\nto manufacture the products.14 Both Dettrick and Yin gave evidence\n\nwhich contradicted Phua’s version. Leggett in his evidence said that the 2 resins are\n\nnot unique in nature and substance. In the manufacture of paints, coatings and similar\n\nproducts the practice of the industry is to have alternative raw materials of all\n\ncomponents. This is a prudent measure to prevent disruptions or to prevent exploitation.\n\nHe points out that similar resins are available from 9 other suppliers worldwide,\n\nincluding Hoechst AG, Eternal Chemicals, Taipei and so on. Yin confirmed that Panatron was\n\nfree to source for the resins from other suppliers, after obtaining the approval of\n\nDettrick who put in this contractual requirement to ensure that quality control of the\n\nChemtour products was maintained.15 I come now to the circumstances\n\nsurrounding the cessation of supply by Nuplex. In early September, 1997, according to\n\nDettrick, he received a telephone call from Leggett. Leggett informed him that he had\n\nreceived an inquiry from a certain David Kinsman for Nuplex products. That was the first\n\ntime Dettrick had spoken to any employee of Nuplex. Other than this, Dettrick had never\n\nmaintained any contact with any employee of Nuplex. It was also during this telephone\n\nconversation that Dettrick informed Leggett of the termination of the Licence Agreement\n\nwith Panatron. Leggett confirmed this evidence.16 As between Nuplex and Panatron, the\n\npayment for the consignment stock became a bone of contention between the two parties.\n\nPanatron, through Phua, declined to pay. He also declined to release the balance of the\n\nunused buffer stock of the two resins. On 20 October 1997 Nuplex through their solicitors\n\nterminated the ‘consignment’ arrangements and demanded the return of the\n\nremaining unused stock from both Panatron and their warehouse keeper, Messrs KNT Transport\n\nServices. Panatron refused to pay for the portion used and declined to release the\n\nremaining buffer stock, alleging that Nuplex had agreed to the long term supply of the two\n\nresins and that the consignment arrangement was not terminable except with the consent of\n\nboth parties.",
        "My decisions": "17 I turn to the first question: did\n\nNuplex agree to supply the two resins in perpetuity for so long as Panatron wanted, as\n\nasserted by Panatron in paras 1, 2, 3 and 5 of their Re-Amended Defence and Amended\n\nCounterclaim? In evaluating the evidence, I am struck by the tenuous and tentative nature\n\nof Phua’s evidence. He was unable to give direct evidence. Much of his evidence is\n\nwithout basis. He is wrong to assert that the two resins are unique in substance and in\n\nnature. He is wrong to say that they can only be obtained from Nuplex. While I appreciate\n\nthat sometimes facts are stranger than fiction, I must say that in this instance, Phua has\n\nnot convinced me that there are any convincing circumstances which make it likely that\n\nNuplex would agree to what is, on the face of it, a rather burdensome obligation in\n\nperpetuity. I am driven to reject his evidence. Leggett, Dettrick and Yin are far more\n\ncredible witnesses in contrast to Phua.18 The next issue is a matter of\n\nconstruction of the two ‘contractual’ letters and turns on the circumstances, if\n\nat all, under which the ‘consignment’ agreement could be terminated. Panatron\n\nassert that it is terminable only and only if both parties agree. This is another way of\n\nsaying that this was an agreement which could not be terminated without the consent of\n\nPanatron. This contention calls to mind the pragmatically wise dictum of Lord Reid inWickman\n\nTools v Schuler AG[1994] AC 235 at p 251 E: \"The fact that a particular\n\nconstruction leads to a very unreasonable result must be a relevant consideration. The\n\nmore unreasonable the result the more unlikely it is that the parties can have intended\n\nit, and if they do intend it the more necessary it is that they shall make that intention\n\nabundantly clear.\" Reading the two letters between Nuplex and Panatron and evaluating\n\nthe conflicting oral evidence, there is, in my view, no justification to place too literal\n\na meaning to the phrase \"mutually agreed\" in Nuplex’s letter. That was an\n\noffer of a term which was left unanswered by Yin in his reply. The single phrase is far\n\ntoo narrow, and is certainly inapt, to express with sufficient clarity if the mutual\n\nintention was that the buffer stock agreement was to be terminable only with the consent\n\nof both parties. In my view, a reasonable construction is to imply the term that the\n\nagreement was terminable on reasonable notice. What is reasonable notice is in every case\n\na question of fact. Panatron also fail on this part of their claim.19 Finally, I will deal with Phua’s\n\nallegation that Nuplex had colluded and committed civil conspiracy with Dettrick to injure\n\nthe interest of Panatron. The allegation against Nuplex in the context of this case is so\n\nfar fetched that I am driven to remark that this notion is a figment of Phua’s\n\nfevered imagination. Dettrick was never in contact with anybody of any authority in Nuplex\n\nbefore the termination of his Licence Agreement with Panatron on 23 August 1997. There was\n\nno combination at all because the alleged civil conspirators had never been in touch in\n\nany way at all material times. The supply of the 2 chemical resins are easily available\n\nfrom many suppliers the world over and there was no basis or motivation for any sort of\n\nconspiracy.",
        "Conclusions": "20 Accordingly, there must be judgment\n\nwith costs on the High Court scale for Nuplex in the sum of US$49,364.00 together with\n\ninterest thereon at 6% p.a. calculated from 28 November 1997, the date Nuplex commenced\n\ntheir suit in the Subordinate Court. Panatron’s counterclaims are dismissed with\n\ncosts.Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
