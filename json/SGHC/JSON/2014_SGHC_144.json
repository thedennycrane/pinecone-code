        "Conclusion": "17     I therefore order that the husband pay $300,000 lump sum maintenance, failing which he is to pay the wife maintenance for the two children fixed at $3,500 a month. I award the wife 60% of the matrimonial assets, and the husband, the other 40%. I will hear the parties on submissions on costs on a later date and the manner of division if they are unable to agree."
