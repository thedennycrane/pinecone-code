        "26 THIRD AVENUE (‘26\n\nTA’)": "8.        \n\nAccording to Tong Djoe’s AEIC (para 9 and 10), his family together with Mdm\n\nTan’s mother, Mdm Ang Joo Poh, were living at 26 TA in the 1960s. He had rented it\n\nfrom one John Sum. In 1964, John Sum, the owner of 26 TA, approached him to purchase 26\n\nTA. Mdm Tan and Tong Djoe liked 26 TA and so Tong Djoe agreed to buy 26 TA for $250,000.\n\nThe purchase price was paid in instalments of $10,000 per month. However, he neglected to\n\nget 26 TA transferred until 1976 when it was transferred to Keng Tit. Tong Djoe added that\n\nin 1966, while Mdm Tan took an evening walk around 26 TA, she noticed an empty plot of\n\nland at 18 NC within walking distance of 26 TA. She told him about it and how the view was\n\nspectacular as it was sited on a slope. He then went to see this plot of land with her and\n\neventually he paid about $14,508 for it. The plot of land was, however, then registered in\n\nMdm Tan’s name.9.        Keng\n\nMeng’s AEIC (para 24) also asserted that the Tong family had lived in 26 TA since the\n\nearly 1960s, first as tenants and subsequently as owners. Keng Meng’s evidence was\n\nthat he knew that sometime around 1964, Tong Djoe had agreed to purchase 26 TA ‘from\n\nthe then owner John Sum’ and this property was paid for in instalments. When it was\n\npaid up, the property was transferred (presumably by John Sum) to Keng Tit.10.        \n\nHowever, according to a search (DBD 1023), John Sum was not the owner of 26 TA in the\n\n1960s. At that time, the owner was one Rachel Sum. On 18 November 1971, she conveyed 26 TA\n\nto John Sum.11.        I\n\nalso note that during cross-examination, Tong Djoe’s evidence was that he was staying\n\nboth at 61 Grange Road and 26 TA between 1968 to 1978, 61 Grange Road having been bought\n\nby Tunas (NE 25 to 27).12.        \n\nDuring cross-examination of Keng Meng, Keng Meng said that he and his parents were staying\n\nat 19 and 26 Third Avenue between 1964 to 1969 and from 1969 to 1978, they were staying at\n\n61 Grange Road (NE 72 and 73). Keng Meng’s wife Ming Min also said in\n\ncross-examination that when she married Keng Meng in 1973, the Tong family was staying at\n\n61 Grange Road and no where else (NE 132 to 133).13.        \n\nFurthermore, during cross-examination, Tong Djoe said that he had bought 26 TA for $40,000\n\n(NE 28). When it was pointed out to him that para 10 of his own AEIC referred to a\n\npurchase consideration of $250,000, he insisted that 26 TA was bought at $40,000 and he\n\npaid this sum in instalments of $10,000 per month. He said the $250,000 was ‘a\n\ntechnical point between John Sum and my son’. He then said that his son and Mdm Tan\n\nhad attended to the matter. All he knew was he paid $40,000. He did not know the details\n\n(NE 28 and 29).14.        I\n\nam of the view that even if Tong Djoe and the Tong family were residing at 26 TA in the\n\n1960s before moving to 61 Grange Road, this property was not bought from John Sum in 1964\n\nor thereabouts. If the purchase had been in or about 1964, Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan would not\n\nhave waited 12 years until 1976 to get the property transferred to Keng Tit’s name. I\n\nam also of the view that the purchase of 26 TA was at the price of $250,000 and not\n\n$40,000 and that the purchase was handled by Mdm Tan. Whether Tong Djoe paid the purchase\n\nprice or part of it is another matter.",
        "PURCHASE OF 18 NC": "15.        \n\nComing back to 18 NC, I accept that it was Mdm Tan who first became interested in it. It\n\nwas purchased in 1966/1967 and registered in Mdm Tan’s name. At that time, it was\n\nvacant land.16.        As\n\nI have said, Tong Djoe’s position was that he paid the purchase price of about\n\n$14,508. This was disputed by the liquidator because Keng Hiang and Jenny said that Mdm\n\nTan provided the funds for the purchase. Their position was that Mdm Tan came from a\n\nwealthy family. Furthermore, she was running a tailoring business selling garments to\n\nretail shops. The business was known as Li Ping from which she made profits. From these\n\nprofits, she bought 18 NC. Tong Djoe’s witnesses Keng Meng and Kheng Ann did not\n\naccept that Mdm Tan came from a wealthy family. For example, para 10 of Kheng Ann’s\n\nAEIC states that Mdm Tan came from a rather poor family. Her mother, Mdm Ang, used to run\n\na small provision shop in Singapore and Tong Djoe used to purchase goods from her. That\n\nwas how Tong Djoe came to know Mdm Tan. Yet this evidence was contradicted by Tong Djoe\n\nhimself. He said that when he got to know Mdm Tan, her mother owned a rubber plantation in\n\nMalaysia and was not running a provision shop (NE 8). As for Li Ping, Tong Djoe’s\n\nposition was that Mdm Tan did not make profits from that business.17.        Not\n\nsurprisingly, there was no documentary evidence as to who paid the purchase price for 18\n\nNC, given the very long lapse of time. In addition, witnesses like Keng Hiang, Keng Meng\n\nand Kheng Ann were young at the material time and then had left Singapore for studies\n\noverseas. In the case of Jenny, she was not yet married to Keng Hiang. Her evidence was\n\nbased on what Mdm Tan allegedly told her. Jenny had asserted that she was Mdm Tan’s\n\nconfidante, but, during cross-examination, she had to concede she was nothing of the sort.\n\nIt was also not really disputed that Keng Hiang had married Jenny in a hurry and without\n\nMdm Tan’s approval. Although Jenny sought to portray her relationship with Mdm Tan as\n\na close one, I am of the view that it was otherwise. I make this finding based on various\n\noral evidence and on a letter dated 7 March 1983 which she had written to Keng Tit and\n\nKheng Ann (Exhibit P3). In that letter, she had complained as to how Mdm Tan did not trust\n\nher. To be fair, Mdm Tan was not the trusting sort but the point is that Jenny’s\n\nrelationship with Mdm Tan was not close.18.        \n\nParagraph 31 of Keng Meng’s AEIC stated:‘31. I know that it is not\n\n    possible that my mother came up with her own monies to purchase and develop 18 Namly\n\n    Crescent. First of all, she was a housewife with little means of her own. Secondly, my\n\n    mother was always rather insecure about my father. He was (and still is to this day) a\n\n    very well-known and respected businessman. He was generous with money and many people\n\n    sought his friendship, including many women. My mother was extremely concerned that my\n\n    father would give his fortunes away so much so that she would try to take as much as money\n\n    from him as possible in order to avoid having him give these monies to outsiders.’While the first two sentences of\n\nhis para 31 are disputed, the rest are not.19.        In\n\naddition, it was not disputed that Tong Djoe gave Mdm Tan large sums of cash from time to\n\ntime as household expenses whenever she thought fit to ask for money.20.        On\n\nbalance, I find that Tong Djoe probably provided all or most of the monies to pay for 18\n\nNC.",
        "THE DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION\n\nOF A HOUSE AT 18 NC, THE INCORPORATION OF HUA ANN AND THE TRANSFER OF 18 NC AND 26 TA TO\n\nHUA ANN": "21.        In\n\n1973, the development of a house at 18 NC started. For convenience, I will refer to the\n\nhouse as ‘18 NC’ as well. It was not disputed that Mdm Tan was in charge of this\n\nand she spent much time on its design and supervising its construction in her own way,\n\nincluding checking on the supply of materials.22.        On\n\n29 September 1973, restriction on the ownership of residential property by non-Singapore\n\ncitizens was imposed although the actual legislation was enacted subsequently with\n\nretrospective effect. Although Mdm Tan could still retain ownership of 18 NC, which was\n\nresidential property, neither she nor Tong Djoe could acquire any interest in any other\n\nresidential property, unless approval was obtained from the relevant authority, because\n\nboth were not Singapore citizens at the material time. Hua Ann was incorporated in 1974.23.        The\n\nconstruction works for a house at 18 NC also commenced in 1974, according to Ming Min. On\n\n8 January 1975, the Registrar of Titles gave Hua Ann clearance to acquire residential\n\nproperty so long as all members and all directors of Hua Ann are Singapore citizens (DBD\n\n1063).24.        On\n\n31 July 1975, 18 NC was conveyed by Mdm Tan to Hua Ann for a consideration of $120,000.\n\nParagraph 6 of the Amended Statement of Claim states, ‘…It was not a sale. Mdm\n\nTan did not ask for any payment and there was no consideration for the transfer’.\n\nHowever, although Mdm Tan did not receive the purchase price, she was recorded as a\n\ncreditor of Hua Ann for the sale price. Therefore it is not true to say that there was no\n\nconsideration for the transfer.25.        In\n\nthat same year, various properties were also acquired by Hua Ann from Mdm Tan:(a) 28 Mt Senai (Sinai) Avenue(b) 18 Wattern (Watten) Park(c) 166 Wattern (Watten) Estate\n\n    Road(d) 8E Taman Serai (later known\n\n    as 2 Taman Serasi #06-08(e) Lot 1026 Mt Senai (Sinai)(see Jenny’s AEIC p 148\n\nwhich exhibits a letter from John Ching & Company, Chartered Secretaries and\n\nManagement Consultants, to the Comptroller of Income Tax (‘CIT’) dated 8 October\n\n1978 and see the searches on some of the properties in DBD Vol 9. According to para 15 of\n\nJenny’s AEIC, Hua Ann also owned other properties). The letter dated 8 October 1978\n\nfrom John Ching & Company was sent on behalf of Hua Ann and it stated that Mdm Tan was\n\na creditor in respect of the properties purchased from her. Another letter dated 15\n\nDecember 1978 from John Ching & Company also to CIT stated in the last para, ‘We\n\nwish to confirm that the Company is dealing in property and houses rental business. And\n\nMdm Tan Beow Hua is in no way related to the Company’. The last sentence was not\n\ntrue, although I am not saying that John Ching & Company knew it was untrue.26.        As\n\nI have mentioned, 26 TA was transferred in April 1976 by John Sum to Keng Tit for $250,000\n\n(DBD 1038). In May 1978, Keng Tit transferred 26 TA to Hua Ann for $200,000.00 (DBD 1056).\n\nIn the same year i.e 1978, a bank had repossessed 61 Grange Road where the Tong family had\n\nbeen staying and they moved to 26 TA.27.        The\n\ndesign and building of the house at 18 NC took about six years from 1973. It was common\n\nground that Mdm Tan was in charge and she spent much time on it, often changing her mind\n\nas to what she wanted. Tong Djoe said he assigned some employees from Tunas to help Mdm\n\nTan deal with the architects and contractors. I would add that Ming Min married Keng Meng\n\nin 1973 and Jenny married Keng Hiang in 1975. When Ming Min or Jenny was in Singapore,\n\neach would be asked to assist Mdm Tan. The construction was completed in late 1979 and the\n\nTemporary Occupation Permit or Licence was obtained in 1980.",
        "WAS 18 NC MEANT TO BE A FAMILY\n\nHOME AND A RETIREMENT VILLA FOR TONG DJOE AND MDM TAN?": "28.        As\n\nI have said, it was not disputed that Mdm Tan spent a lot of time in the design and\n\nconstruction of the house at 18 NC. It was and is a house with three levels each having\n\nits own bedrooms, bathrooms and living and dining area and its own kitchen. It has a\n\nswimming pool. The first and third levels are accessible from the Namly Crescent side\n\nwhereas the second level has its own access from Fourth Avenue. There is also an intercom\n\nsystem which allowed the occupants on the various floors to communicate with each other\n\nand a music system for music to flow throughout the whole house, including the garden (NE\n\n153).29.        \n\nTong Djoe’s position was that these features demonstrated that Mdm Tan intended the\n\nhouse to be used by the extended Tong family where each family staying there would have\n\nprivacy and yet stay together. The liquidator’s position was that the design of the\n\nhouse enabled it to be rented out to various tenants and the first and second levels were\n\nin fact, for much of the time, rented out to various tenants, whereas the third level was\n\nrented out for two years between 1 August 1992 and 31 July 1994.30.        The\n\nliquidator’s position was also that Hua Ann was a holding company and the use of 18\n\nNC as a family home would be contrary to its memorandum. Furthermore, 18 NC was also\n\ndescribed as an investment property in Hua Ann’s books. Hence, even if Mdm Tan had\n\nentered into an arrangement with Tong Djoe to allow him to live at the third level for the\n\nrest of his life, as claimed by him, this would not have been in the best interest of Hua\n\nAnn and would have infringed, in particular, Article 55 of Hua Ann’s Memorandum of\n\nAssociation which provides for the doing of all things to enhance the value of any\n\nproperty of Hua Ann (see para 68 and 69 of liquidator’s closing submission).31.        To\n\ncounter the liquidator’s assertions, Mr Woo, Counsel for Tong Djoe, pointed out that\n\neven when the first floor of 18 NC was being marketed to tenants, Mdm Tan had at one time\n\nrequired some space on the first floor to be set aside so that one of her sons could stay\n\nthere. Indeed, at one time when the first floor was let out , the occupant and his wife\n\nhad to sign letters to allow one of Mdm Tan’s sons to use two of the rooms on that\n\nfloor. As for Hua Ann being an investment holding company and 18 NC being described as an\n\ninvestment property, Hua Ann was a family company and there was nothing wrong with a\n\nfamily company using its properties for the residence of family members. Indeed, the\n\nliquidator accepted that it was not ultra vives the memorandum of Hua Ann for any of its\n\nproperties to be used for occupation by the Tong family (NE 181 and 183).32.        I\n\nam of the view that Mdm Tan had intended 18 NC to be a family home where Tong Djoe and her\n\ncould live in, if she so wished. That is why she spent so much time on its design and\n\nconstruction and why there is an intercom system and a music system connecting the entire\n\nhouse. However, her design of the house allowed separate levels to be rented out should\n\nshe so decide. The mere fact that Hua Ann is an investment holding company and 18 NC is\n\ndescribed as an investment property does not preclude family members from residing in 18\n\nNC. I note also that 26 TA was an investment property of Hua Ann but it was used as a\n\nresidence of the Tong family. However, if there is a dispute among shareholders on the use\n\nof properties owned by a company, then that is a different matter. Whether Tong\n\nDjoe’s claim to have a right to live at the third level of 18 NC for the rest of his\n\nlife is ultra vives the Memorandum of Association of Hua Ann is another matter. For\n\nreasons which are elaborated in my judgment, I need not decide on this point. However, I\n\nwould add that it is not sufficient for Tong Djoe to establish that 18 NC was originally\n\nmeant to be a family home and/or a retirement villa.",
        "WHO PAID FOR THE CONSTRUCTION AND\n\nRELATED COSTS AND RENOVATION COSTS OF THE HOUSE AT 18 NC?": "33.        \n\nTong Djoe claims that he provided the money for the construction and related costs, such\n\nas architects’ fees, and renovation costs of the house at 18 NC. For convenience, I\n\nwill refer to all such costs as ‘the construction costs’. However, the documents\n\nhe relied on did not establish that he had made direct payment for such costs.34.        In\n\nso far as Tong Djoe had exhibited receipts and cheques (see, for example, his AEIC p 63,\n\n67, 85), these documents illustrated that Hua Ann made the payments. As for some payments\n\nmade by Mdm Tan, they were credited in Journal Slips to her account meaning that she was\n\ntreated, probably by Hua Ann, as a creditor for these payments (see, for example, his AEIC\n\np 77 to 79). In so far as Tong Djoe relied on a list of names and amounts dated 30 April\n\n1981 (see his AEIC p 95), he was not able to establish that he had made direct payment of\n\nthe amounts in the list.35.        As\n\nfor payment vouchers of Tunas, there were two categories of such vouchers. The first\n\ncategory demonstrated that Tunas had made various payments to the Comptroller of Property\n\nTax in respect of 18 NC. However, these were not gifts by Tunas to Hua Ann. These were\n\npayments made on Hua Ann’s account and, in the absence of any contrary evidence, I\n\nhave to assume that they were debited against Hua Ann’s account with Tunas.\n\nAccordingly, these payments by Tunas could not be gifts by Tong Djoe to Hua Ann.36.        The\n\nsecond category of Tunas’ payment vouchers demonstrated that there were various cash\n\npayments made by Tunas mainly to Mdm Tan and some of which were made to her mother Mdm\n\nAng. Such cash payments were made on Tong Djoe’s account. Again, in the absence of\n\nany contrary evidence, I have to assume that these payments were debited against Tong\n\nDjoe’s account with Tunas. It was not in dispute that from time to time, Mdm Tan\n\nwould ask Tong Djoe for money as home expenses. Also, in cross-examination, Tong Djoe said\n\nthat the monies he provided for the construction costs were through Mdm Tan (NE 61).37.        \n\nFurthermore, Jenny produced cheque butts of a bank account of Hua Ann for various payments\n\ntowards the construction costs. In addition, the liquidator’s Supplemental Report\n\nalso exhibited documentary evidence showing payments made by Hua Ann or charged to Hua\n\nAnn’s account for the construction costs (see, for example, para 9.1, 9.16 to 9.19,\n\n9.23 to 9.29 of his Supplemental Report).38.        The\n\nnext question then is the identity of the source of Hua Ann’s money. As I have\n\nmentioned, Jenny and Keng Hiang gave evidence that Mdm Tan had been running a profitable\n\ntailoring business known as Li Ping. However, the liquidator’s closing submission did\n\nnot assert that the money for the construction costs came from the alleged profits. During\n\nthe trial, it was also suggested that rent from various properties were used to pay the\n\nconstruction costs of 18 NC but again the liquidator’s closing submission did not\n\nrely on this as being the source of the payments for the construction costs. The\n\nliquidator relied only on financing from Bank of East Asia as being the source of the\n\npayments (para 76 of liquidator’s closing submission). However, the documents relied\n\non by the liquidator, at most, demonstrated that Hua Ann’s account with Bank of East\n\nAsia was being used to make the payments. They did not establish where the funds in that\n\naccount came from. Besides, there was no evidence that a $120,000 facility from The Bank\n\nof East Asia Limited in April 1975 was ever drawn down or, if drawn down, was used to pay\n\nthe construction costs. Furthermore, the construction costs amounted to more than\n\n$600,000. Another facility from this bank in 1984 for $1.5 million (Jenny’s AEIC p\n\n360) was available only after 18 NC had been built.39.        As\n\nfor the monies which Tong Djoe gave Mdm Tan from time to time as household expenses, the\n\nliquidator’s position was that such monies were used to pay for Mdm Tan’s\n\npersonal expenses like car repair, home expenses, entertainment and funeral expenses. It\n\nwas submitted for the liquidator that there was no evidence that such monies were ever\n\nused to pay the constructions costs.40.       \n\nUnfortunately, the accounting records of Hua Ann produced before me were not complete.\n\nHowever, where available, they demonstrated that Mdm Tan had deposited various sums of\n\nmoney into Hua Ann from time to time. I am of the view that there would have been no need\n\nfor her to do so if the facility from Bank of East Asia was sufficient to pay the\n\nconstruction costs, as well as to buy other properties. Also, if the monies from Tong Djoe\n\nfor household expenses were used only for Mdm Tan’s personal expenses, she would not\n\nhave deposited them into Hua Ann. In my view, such monies were deposited into Hua Ann to\n\nhelp pay the construction costs, as well as to buy other properties. However, it is\n\nimportant to bear in mind that these deposits were not gifts by Mdm Tan to Hua Ann. Her\n\naccount with Hua Ann would show a credit in her favour for each sum deposited, meaning\n\nthat she was a creditor of Hua Ann for each sum.41.        \n\nAlthough I find that the monies deposited by Mdm Tan into Hua Ann came from Tong Djoe, I\n\nalso find that the monies were gifts to Mdm Tan by Tong Djoe although, at times, she would\n\ntell him what she wanted the money for (NE 45, NE 47).42.        I\n\nwould add that after Mdm Tan’s death in October 1986, Tong Djoe continued to provide\n\nmonies for home expenses but this was because he was the patriarch of the family, as he\n\nadmitted (NE 45). The monies he provided were of smaller amounts (NE 241) and there is no\n\nevidence that these monies were deposited with Hua Ann or that Hua Ann used them to pay\n\nthe construction costs of 18 NC or any other further renovation costs.",
        "WHOSE COMPANY WAS HUA ANN?": "43.        The\n\nname ‘Hua’ was taken from Mdm Tan’s name i.e Tan Beow Hua, and the name\n\n‘Ann’ was taken from the name of the youngest son Kheng Ann. The company was\n\nnamed Hua Ann Brothers because at that time it was meant eventually for the sons.44.        Mdm\n\nTan was an independent minded person. At times, she would even make decisions on financial\n\nmatters first before asking Tong Djoe for money (NE 64). Although neither Tong Djoe or Mdm\n\nTan was ever a director of shareholder of Hua Ann, Mdm Tan was, as I find, the person in\n\nde facto control of Hua Ann while she was alive. She passed away in October 1986 while\n\nswimming in a pool at 18 NC. No witness has disputed that she was in control of Hua Ann\n\nexcept for Keng Hiang. He had initially admitted that she was in control (NE 261), but\n\nthen chose to deny this later (NE 289 to 290). Mdm Tan decided who would be the directors\n\nand shareholders of Hua Ann from time to time. When her sons were not in Singapore, she\n\nused her friends and Ming Min as directors and/or shareholders. When she used friends as\n\nshareholders, she got them to sign trust deeds or declarations of trust in favour of her\n\nsons. Some of these documents are exhibited in the AEIC of Tong Djoe.45.        \n\nEven when the sons became shareholders, she apparently got them (or some of them) to sign\n\ntrust deeds of their shares in her favour. For example, there was a trust deed signed by\n\nKeng Meng of shares registered in his name (which he said belonged to Kheng Lay) in favour\n\nof Mdm Tan. Kheng Ann said that he too signed a trust deed in her favour. There was a\n\nletter from Chu Chan & Partners to Mdm Tan dated 3 March 1986 stating, inter alia,\n\nthat Kheng Ann, Keng Tit and Tong Yee (Keng Meng’s son) had signed trust deeds and a\n\nbill from the law firm for preparing five sets of trust deeds. However, no one from that\n\nlaw firm gave evidence on the letter or the bill. Even then, I am prepared to accept for\n\nthe purpose of the present litigation that at least some, if not all, of her sons signed\n\ntrust deeds in her favour. As I have said, Mdm Tan was not the trusting sort of person and\n\nthis lack of trust extended to her sons or at least some of them.46.        \n\nAlso, on 7 April 1975, a power of attorney was given by Hua Ann to Mdm Tan giving her\n\npower to manage the business of Hua Ann and to exercise the powers of the directors (2PSB\n\n1).47.        It\n\nis also significant to note that it was Mdm Tan, and not Tong Djoe, who was recorded as a\n\ncreditor for each sum of money deposited by Mdm Tan. Indeed, none of Hua Ann’s\n\naccounts which were available showed Tong Djoe to be a creditor of Hua Ann (NE 56). It was\n\nalso Mdm Tan, and not Tong Djoe, who decided how much monies she would deposit with Hua\n\nAnn (NE 46). I am of the view that this was because Tong Djoe was not supposed to have any\n\ninterest in Hua Ann. As Tong Djoe’s own witness Keng Meng had emphasized, Mdm Tan was\n\nconcerned about Tong Djoe’s generosity to his friends and his willingness to give his\n\npersonal guarantee for their businesses (see Keng Meng’s AEIC para 31 and NE 87, 89).\n\nI also note from the trust deed of shares she obtained from Keng Meng that the trust deed\n\nwas in her favour and not Tong Djoe and that after Mdm Tan passed away in October 1986,\n\nTong Djoe did not request any of his sons to sign a similar trust deed in his favour.\n\nFurthermore, after Mdm Tan’s death, Hua Ann was run by some of the sons from time to\n\ntime but never by Tong Djoe. Indeed, he was not even informed when shares in Hua Ann were\n\nallotted to Soh Ting’s children in 1988, after Mdm Tan’s death (NE 77 and 78).\n\nAlso, monies were being withdrawn from Hua Ann by the sons, after Mdm Tan’s death,\n\napparently without the need for Tong Djoe’s approval.48.        In\n\nmy view, Hua Ann was Mdm Tan’s company while Tunas was Tong Djoe’s company. I\n\nwould add that 18 NC was mortgaged by Hua Ann from time to time without Tong Djoe’s\n\nprior written consent.",
        "WHERE DID TONG DJOE STAY PRIOR TO\n\nMDM TAN’S DEATH?": "49.        As\n\nI have mentioned, the Tong family stayed at 61 Grange Road initially, although there is\n\nsome evidence that they stayed at 26 TA before they stayed at 61 Grange Road. After 61\n\nGrange Road was repossessed by a bank in 1978, they stayed at 26 TA. At that time, the\n\nconstruction of 18 NC had not yet been completed.50.        \n\nAccording to Tong Djoe, after 18 NC was completed, he chose to stay at the third level\n\nthereof as it had the best view and he and his wife moved to the third level (see his AEIC\n\npara 24 and 30). Yet he also said he stayed at 26 TA on weekdays, and lived at 18 NC on\n\nweekends and even then, it was only on some Sundays that the family would gather at 18 NC\n\n(see his AEIC para 34 and 73).51.        \n\nThis evidence was corroborated by Keng Meng (see his AEIC para 42 and NE 92), Keng Hiang\n\n(NE 310) and Jenny (NE 234). According to Keng Meng, it was Mdm Tan who would be insisting\n\nthat the family members attend the Sunday lunch if Tong Djoe was in Singapore (AEIC para\n\n42 and NE 93). In my view, 26 TA was the main residence of Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan. They\n\nwent to 18 NC occasionally. This was primarily for Sunday lunches with the rest of the\n\nfamily who would gather there.52.        In\n\nthe meantime, Keng Tit had returned from overseas in 1984 and he was residing in one of\n\nthe rooms at the third level of 18 NC until he passed away in 1991 (see Keng Meng’s\n\nAEIC para 38).",
        "WHERE DID TONG DJOE STAY AFTER\n\nMDM TAN’S DEATH?": "53.        I\n\nwill deal with the question as to where Tong Djoe stayed after Mdm Tan’s death in\n\nvarious stages:(a) From 1986 to 1991 when Keng\n\n    Tit died(b) From 1992 to 1994 when the\n\n    third level of 18 NC was rented out(c) From 1994 to February 1999\n\n    when 26 TA was sold(d) After 26 TA was sold.",
        "From 1986 to 1991": "54.        As\n\nI have said, Mdm Tan passed away in October 1986. I am of the view that Tong Djoe\n\ncontinued staying at 26 TA. Furthermore, with her death, the Sunday lunches and family\n\ngatherings either stopped or became less frequent, and, consequently, Tong Djoe’s\n\nvisits to 18 NC became less frequent too (see again Keng Meng’s AEIC para 42 where he\n\nsaid that the Sunday lunches continued until his mother passed away).",
        "Between 1992 to 1994": "55.        As\n\nI have mentioned, Keng Tit passed away in 1991. It is not disputed that for two years\n\nbetween 1 August 1992 to 31 July 1994, the third level of 18 NC was rented to an outsider.\n\nYet in the AEICs of Tong Djoe, Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, this fact was not\n\nmentioned. The impression from their AEICs was that Tong Djoe had been staying at the\n\nthird level all along.56.        For\n\nexample, in para 74 of Tong Djoe’s AEIC, he asserted that after Keng Tit’s\n\ndeath, he did not stay at the third level but he did not remove all his belongings. I am\n\nof the view that if he did not remove his belongings, the third level could not have been\n\nrented out, unless his belongings were stored somewhere else at the third level. In any\n\nevent, that is a different picture from what he had painted in his para 74. A second\n\nexample is Kheng Ann’s AEIC where at para 65 he states that Tong Djoe has been\n\nstaying at the third level since 1979/1980 ‘up to this date’ meaning the date of\n\nhis AEIC. He reiterated this at NE 160. It was only later at NE 167 that he raised the\n\nfact of the tenancy of the third level and then alleged, in NE 168, that Tong Djoe had\n\nmoved permanently to 18 NC from about July 1994.",
        "Between 1994 to February 1999": "57.        \n\nAccording to the AEICs of Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, when Kheng Ann came back from\n\nAmerica in 1994, he stayed with Tong Djoe at the third level of 18 NC to help take care of\n\nTong Djoe until 1999 when Kheng Ann moved to stay at his own place in the Balmoral area.\n\nIn particular, Kheng Ann said in para 34 of his AEIC:‘34. My return to Singapore\n\n    in 1994 was prompted by my father’s ill health. My father was about 70 years old.\n\n    Further, my wife and I decided to start a family in Singapore. We stayed with our father\n\n    at the 3rdlevel of 18 Namly Crescent to take care of him.’I reiterate that Kheng Ann had\n\nalso said in cross-examination that Tong Djoe moved back to 18 NC ‘permanently’\n\nfrom July 1994 (NE 168).58.        \n\nHowever, in cross-examination, Kheng Ann said that when he returned in 1994, he was living\n\nat Soo Chow Gardens with his wife and then at 18 NC (NE 167). This corroborates para 52 of\n\nJenny’s AEIC where she said that in July 1994, Kheng Ann and his wife had moved into\n\nthe third level of 18 NC from Kheng Ann’s mother-in-law’s place at Upper Thomson\n\nRoad.59.        On\n\n23 July 1994, Keng Hiang wrote a letter (DBD 378), in his capacity as Managing Director of\n\nHua Ann, to Kheng Ann, to state that locks to the third level had been changed without his\n\nknowledge, that the third level was meant for rental and that Kheng Ann had committed\n\ntrespass. According to Kheng Ann, this was Keng Hiang’s way of hitting back at Tong\n\nDjoe through him because by then the relationship between Tong Djoe and Keng Hiang had\n\nsoured and Keng Hiang was sacked from Tunas (NE 167). Secondly, Keng Hiang was unhappy\n\nwith Kheng Ann for looking after Keng Hiang’s son in America at Jenny’s request\n\nwithout Keng Hiang’s knowledge (NE 168). Ming Min’s AEIC para 31 said that by\n\n1994 the relationship between the children had strained over money issues of Hua Ann and\n\nKheng Ann was getting a lot of flak about a property in Los Angeles. Whatever the reason\n\nor reasons, I accept that by 1994, Keng Hiang’s relationship with Tong Djoe and Kheng\n\nAnn had soured.60.        I\n\nwould add that the occupant under the tenancy of the third level had probably moved out\n\nearlier before the expiry of the tenancy and Kheng Ann then moved in in July 1994. I also\n\nnote that Kheng Ann did not respond to the 23 July 1994 letter to say that he was staying\n\nat 18 NC to look after Tong Djoe.61.        \n\nAccording to Jenny, Kheng Ann had cleverly asked Tong Djoe to stay with him at the third\n\nlevel of 18 NC in 1994 on the pretext of taking care of Tong Djoe so that Keng Hiang would\n\nnot hassle Kheng Ann to move out. She said that Tong Djoe stayed there for three months\n\n(her AEIC para 53) or five months (NE 249). Tong Djoe was diagnosed with prostrate cancer\n\nin February 1995 and underwent an immediate operation, stayed in the hospital for a month\n\nand thereafter returned to 26 TA (her AEIC para 54).62.        I\n\nrefer also to the minutes of an extra-ordinary General Meeting of Hua Ann held on 15\n\nDecember 1998 (DBD 387 to 388). The minutes were signed by Keng Meng. They stated, inter\n\nalia:‘(3) Mr. Tong Keng Meng read\n\n    out the Notice which was submitted by Mr. Tong Keng Hiang on 3rd December 1998 and put\n\n    forward the following proposals for discussion and voting:-(a) For the safety reasons,no\n\n      director/shareholder should allow third party to use 18 Namly Crescent as a storage place\n\n      or for any other purposes. He/She should be fully responsible for the consequences if\n\n      any damage to the said buildings or causes any harm to the occupied tenants.Voting Result: (For: 5 Against: 0\n\n      Abstain: 0)The Chairman declared that the\n\n    Resolution was passed.(b) \"In the interest of all\n\n      shareholders and to generate more rental income to the Company. Director/Shareholder Mr.\n\n      Tong Kheng Ann who without the consent of the majority of shareholders and unlawfully\n\n      occupied the third level of 18 Namly Crescent since 18th July 1994, should vacate from the\n\n      above premises within one month so that the premises could be rented out. The Company have\n\n      since incurred loss of income revenue for the pass fifty-two months and based on average\n\n      rental of S$4,500 per month, it had amounting to S$234,000.00.\"Voting Result: (For: 2 Against: 2\n\n      Abstain: 1)The Chairman declared that the\n\n    proposal be rejected.Mr. Tong Kheng Ann promised to\n\n    the shareholders that he move out latest by 1st May 1999 or earlier whenever the company\n\n    gets a tenant for the unit he occupied.’[Emphasis added.]63.        I\n\nnote that in Tong Djoe’s own AEIC at para 75 and 76, he said:‘75. Thereafter, in 1994, I\n\n    lived at 18 Namly Crescentmore often. This was precipitated by the fact that Keng\n\n    Hiang and Jenny were constantly quarreling at 26 Third Avenue. Moreover my relationship\n\n    with Keng Hiang became very tense so much so that I terminated his employment in Tunas in\n\n    May 1994.76. When 26 Third Avenue was\n\n    finally sold in February 1999, Ithenmoved over to stay at 18 Namly Crescent,\n\n    while a lot of my antiques at 26 Third Avenue had to be put temporarily at a friend’s\n\n    place at 53 Happy Avenue East, Singapore. I gave many of my antiques away as there were\n\n    just too many. Eventually, these antiques at 53 Happy Avenue East were kept at 18 Namly\n\n    Crescent.’[Emphasis added.]These paragraphs contradict the\n\nassertion that Tong Djoe had moved back to 18 NC permanently from July 1994.64.        As\n\nI have already said, and as admitted by Tong Djoe and Keng Meng, even when Mdm Tan was\n\nalive, she and Tong Djoe went to 18 NC only occasionally for some of the Sunday lunches.\n\nTheir main residence was 26 TA. After Mdm Tan died in 1986, Tong Djoe continued residing\n\nat 26 TA. Keng Tit was residing in a room at the third level of 18 NC from 1984 to 1991\n\nbut after he died in 1991, the third level was rented out in 1992 for two years. Tong Djoe\n\ncontinued to reside in 26 TA during these two years. Therefore, when Kheng Ann came back\n\nto Singapore in 1994, Tong Djoe was not staying at 18 NC but at 26 TA.65.        In\n\nmy view, when Kheng Ann returned to Singapore in 1994 with his wife, he had no place of\n\nhis own. He then stayed at his mother-in-law’s place at Soo Chow Gardens. However, it\n\nis not true that Kheng Ann returned to Singapore to look after Tong Djoe at 18 NC. If that\n\nwere so, Kheng Ann would not have stayed first at Soo Chow Gardens. I find that Tong Djoe\n\nmust then have asked Kheng Ann to move to the third level of 18 NC as Tong Djoe was not\n\nstaying there.66.        \n\nThen, Keng Hiang discovered that Kheng Ann had moved to the third level and that is why he\n\nsent the letter dated 23 July 1994 to Kheng Ann (which I have referred to in para 59\n\nabove). Tong Djoe then decided to move temporarily to the third level to help Kheng Ann\n\nout as he must have been told by Kheng Ann that Keng Hiang was trying to kick him (Kheng\n\nAnn) out. I accept that subsequently Tong Djoe moved back to 26 TA after he was diagnosed\n\nwith cancer in February 1995 and after his stay in a hospital.67.        The\n\nminutes of 15 December 1998 (which I have referred to in para 62 above) reflected Keng\n\nHiang’s insistence that the third level of 18 NC should be rented out and that Kheng\n\nAnn was still residing there. Faced with Keng Hiang’s insistence, Kheng Ann promised\n\nto move out. There was no mention in the minutes that Tong Djoe was staying at the third\n\nlevel or that Kheng Ann was helping to take care of Tong Djoe at the third level.68.        As\n\nfor Kheng Ann’s evidence that Tong Djoe’s things were at the third level of 18\n\nNC and a maid was also there (NE 169), I am of the view that those ‘things’ were\n\nprobably artefacts that Tong Djoe was in the habit of purchasing (whether for his own\n\nbusiness or for himself, I do not know). On this point, Keng Hiang produced photographs he\n\nhad taken of 26 TA in 1996 and 1997 (Exhibit D7) showing numerous items placed by Tong\n\nDjoe inside and outside 26 TA and an enforcement notice dated 25 January 1997 from the\n\nUrban Redevelopment Authority to Hua Ann stating that 26 TA had been used as a store\n\n(Exhibit D8). Keng Hiang said that some of these artefacts were also stored at the third\n\nlevel of 18 NC and I accept this evidence (NE 279 and NE 281). That is why Keng Hiang\n\npushed the directors to agree at the meeting on 15 December 1998 that ‘no\n\ndirector/shareholder should allow third party to use 18 Namly Crescent as a storage place\n\nor for any other purposes ….’ (DBD 387).69.        As\n\nfor the maid, I am of the view that she was there probably to help clean the place and\n\ntake care of Kheng Ann and his wife and perhaps the artefacts as well.70.        At\n\nthis stage, I would mention that I find Keng Hiang’s alleged concern about the\n\ninterest of Hua Ann to be hypocritical. While he wanted the third level of 18 NC to be\n\nrented out, Jenny and he were staying at 26 TA free of rent together with other family\n\nmembers. Furthermore, he had been taking money from Hua Ann to pay his personal\n\nliabilities.",
        "After February 1999": "71.        The\n\nnext question is where Tong Djoe stayed after 26 TA was sold in February 1999. In para 76\n\nof his AEIC, which I have cited in para 63 above, he said that he then moved over to stay\n\nat 18 NC while a lot of his antiques had to be put temporarily at 53 Happy Avenue East.\n\nEventually they were kept at 18 NC. Interestingly enough, he was not cross-examined by Mr\n\nCharles Ezekiel, Counsel for the liquidator, on this paragraph.72.        \n\nHowever, on the other hand, Mr Woo also did not cross-examine Jenny on her contrary\n\nassertion in para 61 of her AEIC. Paragraph 61 stated:‘61. When the 26 Third\n\n    Avenue property was sold in February 1999 (Completion Date), the Plaintiff himself was not\n\n    even allowed to reside in the 3rdfloor apartment of the 18 Namly Crescent. In\n\n    fact, the Plaintiff had to rent 2 houses to stay and to put all his personal belonging,\n\n    antiques and artefacts. In particular, he rented a property at 53 Happy Avenue East, and\n\n    another at 48 Gentle Road, Singapore from December 1998. He resided in 53 Happy Avenue\n\n    East until December 1999.’73.        \n\nNeither did Mr Woo cross-examine Keng Hiang on para 24 of his AEIC which stated:‘24. Sometime in July 1999,\n\n    Clement Tong moved out of the 3rdfloor 18 Namly Crescent and he handed the\n\n    keys of the 3rdfloor to the Plaintiff. The Plaintiff did not lived there but\n\n    stayed at his penthouse in Tunas Building. On 1 June 2000, I, in the capacity as Managing\n\n    Director of the Defendant Company, wrote to Melvin Tong, the Chairman of the Defendant\n\n    Company and objected to the Plaintiff’s antiques being placed at the 2ndfloor, 3rdfloor and the surrounding compound of 18 Namly Crescent. Annexed\n\n    hereto and marked \"TKH-8\" is the letter dated 1 June 2000.’74.        \n\nNext, I refer to the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 12 April 1999 (PB 1256). The\n\nminutes were signed by Keng Meng, Keng Hiang and Kheng Lay. The minutes stated, inter\n\nalia:‘4) Following previous\n\n    Boards’ decision, Clement confirm to move out from 18 Namly Crescent at a slightly\n\n    later date but not later than mid-June 99. Thevacantpremise is either for Mr.\n\n    Tong Djoe to stay if he wishes, or to be let out to generate additional income.[Emphasis added.]75.        In\n\nmy view, this demonstrated the true state of affairs as at that time. Tong Djoe was not\n\nstaying at 18 NC then (i.e April 1999). Although the minutes said that Tong Djoe could\n\nstay (at the third level) if he wanted to, that was the intention then.76.        As\n\nKeng Hiang had said in his AEIC, he had written on 1 June 2000 to object to Tong\n\nDjoe’s antiques being placed on the second and third levels of 18 NC. The letter is\n\nat DBD 392 and although it did not specifically mention Tong Djoe’s use of the second\n\nand third levels for storage purposes, I accept that that was what the letter was alluding\n\nto.77.        \n\nNext, the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 7 June 2000 stated, inter alia:‘AGENDA(2) To discuss the 2nd and 3rd\n\n    Floor Rental income of 18 Namly Crescent sinceit was left vacant for more than 1 yearfor the interest of Hua Ann Brothers Pte Ltd.(a) Mr. Tong Kheng Lay told the\n\n      meeting that the 2ndfloor of Namly Crescenthas vacant for more than a year,\n\n      and should be rented out to generate income.Voting Result: (For: 4 Against:\n\n        o)(b) Mr. Tong Keng Meng stated\n\n      that as the 3rd Floor isnowoccupied by senior family member and therefore, should\n\n      not be rented out).Voting Result: (For: 2 Against:\n\n        2)’[Emphasis added.]The minutes were signed by Keng\n\nMeng.78.        \n\nAlthough these minutes stated that the 3rdfloor was ‘now’ occupied\n\nby Tong Djoe, the current address on Tong Djoe’s identity card is an address in Tunas\n\nbuilding. He also admitted that he did not have any document showing 18 NC as his address\n\n(NE 15). Furthermore, Mr Woo said in his opening statement that, ‘Plaintiff is\n\nstaying there [meaning 18 NC], perhaps not everyday, sometimes at the penthouse. His\n\npossessions are at the 3rdlevel’ (NE 2).79.        I\n\nam of the view that after 26 TA was sold, Tong Djoe was residing at a place other than the\n\nthird level of 18 NC. This place was probably the penthouse at Tunas Building. However,\n\nTong Djoe’s artefacts were and are stored at the third level of 18 NC.",
        "MY CONCLUSION": "80.        \n\nTong Djoe’s claim, as pleaded, is that he has a right to live at the third level of\n\n18 NC for as long as he lives. Yet, in cross-examination, he asserted repeatedly that 18\n\nNC was his and that he was the true owner of Hua Ann. That was quite a different claim\n\naltogether.81.        \n\nTong Djoe’s claim, as pleaded, is based on an alleged arrangement with Mdm Tan\n\nwhereby she allegedly agreed that he would have such a right if he provided the funds for\n\nthe purchase of 18 NC and the construction of the three storey house at 18 NC. Yet during\n\ncross-examination, he relied not so much on the alleged arrangement with Mdm Tan but on\n\nthe fact that he had provided the funds. That was also the thrust of the evidence, during\n\ncross-examination, of his witnesses Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min.82.        Mr\n\nWoo had sought to rely on the fact that although the sons, as directors of Hua Ann, had\n\nwanted to sell 18 NC and/or 26 TA for some years before February 1999, no such sale was\n\nentered into until 26 TA was sold in February 1999. He submitted that this was because\n\nTong Djoe had to be consulted before 18 NC or 26 TA could be sold. When 26 TA was sold,\n\nthis was done only with Tong Djoe’s consent. The suggestion was that the consultation\n\nwas an acknowledgment of the right Tong Djoe is claiming.83.        In\n\nmy view, there could have been many reasons why no sale was entered into for some time,\n\neven though there was a common intention among the sons to sell. The sons were not seeing\n\neye to eye and might not have agreed on the price or how much weight should be given to\n\nTong Djoe’s views. In any event, none of the witnesses, including Tong Djoe, said\n\nthat the very reason why no sale was entered into earlier was because of the right he has\n\npleaded. For example, Keng Meng and Kheng Ann’s position that Tong Djoe would have to\n\nbe consulted was because he is the patriarch of the family who provided the funds (see,\n\nfor example, NE 112, 160 and 162) and not because he had some arrangement with Mdm Tan or\n\nhad some legal right to be consulted. In the case of 26 TA, Tong Djoe was also staying\n\nthere at the time.84.        Mr\n\nWoo had also relied on the minutes of the directors’ meeting of 12 April 1999, which\n\nI have quoted in para 74 above. He submitted that the minutes reflected Tong Djoe’s\n\nright to stay at the third level of 18 NC. In addition, he also relied on a letter dated 8\n\nAugust 2000 from Soh Ting to Keng Meng in which she said:‘Re: Reside at No. 18\n\n    Namly Crescent 3rd LevelDear Brother,After reading the letter which\n\n    you fax to me dated 1stAugust 2000 from Peter Pang & Co., I, Tong Soh Ting\n\n    and my two children (Mr. Soon Cheng Yee and Miss Soon Tze Ling) hereby supported that Mr.\n\n    Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo should stay at the above mentioned property for the rest of his\n\n    life, if he wants to.You may consider for double\n\n    protection to also have the Tenancy Agreement with Mr. Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo at the\n\n    rental of S$1/- (Singapore Dollar One) only per month.Please try your best to let our\n\n    father Mr. Tong Djoe @ Tong Lian Joo continue to stay at the above mentioned property for\n\n    the rest of his life, if he wants too.’85.        I\n\nam of the view that the minutes of the directors’ meeting of 12 April 1999 fall quite\n\nshort of an acknowledgment of Tong Djoe’s right. Although the minutes appear to\n\nreflect the wishes of the directors, at that time, that Tong Djoe be allowed to stay at\n\nthe third level of 18 NC if he so wished, the focus was on getting Kheng Ann out. Besides,\n\nif Tong Djoe had the right to stay at the third level, the minutes would have been worded\n\ndifferently.86.        I\n\nam also of the view that the letter from Soh Ting dated 8 August 2000 falls short of\n\nacknowledging Tong Djoe’s right as claimed. It was more of a plea that Tong Djoe be\n\nallowed to stay at the third level if he wished. Besides, Soh Ting may no longer be of\n\nthat view as she is apparently now on the side of Keng Hiang where this issue is\n\nconcerned.87.        Mr\n\nWoo also relied on the fact that the minutes of a board meeting of Hua Ann on 8 January\n\n1999 (PB 1253) recorded that the balance of the sale proceeds of 26 TA would be divided\n\ninto six equal shares and if needed could be borrowed by each shareholder. Each\n\nshareholder was to provide such sum ‘at their own accord’ to Tong Djoe.88.        \n\nAccording to Keng Meng, the original intention was to buy a small property for Tong Djoe\n\nfrom the balance of the sale proceeds from the sale of 26 TA but the shareholders began to\n\nhave differing views. So, it was agreed that each should come up with a sum for Tong Djoe\n\n(NE 127). Mr Woo submitted that the decision to come up with a sum for Tong Djoe\n\nrecognised Tong Djoe’s right to reside in the family homes (i.e 26 TA and 18 NC). Mr\n\nWoo also added that it was precisely because the sons recognised Tong Djoe’s right to\n\nreside in the family homes that the minutes of a directors’ resolution of Hua Ann\n\ndated 22 February 1999 recorded that a sum of $70,000 would be advanced to Tong Djoe\n\nand/or Tunas.89.        I\n\ndo not agree with those submissions. If indeed the board had recognised Tong Djoe’s\n\nright, the minutes of 8 January 1999 would not have said that each shareholder was to\n\nprovide such sum ‘at their own accord’ to him. The minutes merely reflected a\n\nwish to benefit Tong Djoe and not an acknowledgement of his right. As events turned out,\n\nthere was a change of mind and no property was purchased for him from the balance of the\n\nsale proceeds. Moreover, Tong Djoe did not assert that Hua Ann or its shareholders were\n\nobliged to buy a property for him (see his AEIC para 103 to 105 and NE 41 where he said,\n\n‘It is ok with me’ even though that intention was not carried out).90.        As\n\nfor the directors’ resolution to advance $70,000 to Tong Djoe or Tunas, I am of the\n\nview that this was because there was another change of mind by some of the shareholders.\n\nHence only Keng Meng agreed to give $50,000 to Tong Djoe which would be debited against\n\nKeng Meng’s account and Soh Ting agreed to give Tong Djoe $10,000, i.e $5,000 from\n\neach of her two children who are registered shareholders and debited to their respective\n\naccounts with Hua Ann. There was no evidence as to whether the balance of $10,000 (to make\n\nup $70,000) was given. Interestingly enough, the cheque for $50,000 was made in favour of\n\nTunas and recorded in the payment voucher as a loan to Tunas (see Tong Djoe’s AEIC p\n\n406 to 410).91.        In\n\nany event, I am of the view that the $70,000 did not constitute an acknowledgment of a\n\nlegal right in Tong Djoe. It merely reflected the wish of some of his children to benefit\n\nhim or Tunas out of their love and respect for him and the belief that he had earlier\n\nfunded the purchase of some properties and the construction costs of 18 NC. If the monies\n\nwere supposed to compensate Tong Djoe for deprivation of a legal right, all the children\n\nwould have given something to Tong Djoe proportionately to their shares in Hua Ann.92.        Mr\n\nWoo also submitted that there was no reason for Keng Meng, Kheng Ann and Ming Min, who are\n\nall shareholders of Hua Ann, to support Tong Djoe’s claim to their own detriment\n\nunless his claim is true. In my view, they have supported Tong Djoe’s claim out of\n\ntheir love and respect for him and in appreciation for what they believe he has done for\n\nthe Tong family. While their motive may be commendable, it does not necessarily make all\n\ntheir evidence true nor Tong Djoe’s claim valid.93.        I\n\nfind that there was no arrangement between Tong Djoe and Mdm Tan as pleaded by Tong Djoe.\n\nHe had assumed, not unnaturally, that, as the patriarch of the family who had provided the\n\nfunds and because Mdm Tan was controlling Hua Ann, he would be entitled to stay at 18 NC\n\nif he so wished. I would add that a unilateral expectation is not binding on others.94.        I\n\nhave also found that Hua Ann was Mdm Tan’s company. She controlled it while she was\n\nalive and she was not controlling it for Tong Djoe. After her death, Hua Ann was\n\ncontrolled by her sons, not Tong Djoe. Hua Ann was incorporated for the benefit of her\n\nsons and herself and the properties acquired by Hua Ann was for their benefit and not Tong\n\nDjoe. True, if she were still alive, she would most probably have allowed Tong Djoe to\n\nstay at the third level, or at any level, of 18 NC if he so wished. However, that would be\n\nbased on her knowledge of the financial support he had provided and her affection and\n\nrespect for him and not because he has an interest or right, enforceable in a court of\n\nlaw.95.        In\n\nany event, Mdm Tan was recorded in Hua Ann’s books as a creditor for the purchase\n\nmonies of 18 NC when she sold and transferred 18 NC to Hua Ann. Likewise, the monies which\n\nTong Djoe gave to Mdm Tan to assist in paying the construction costs of the house at 18 NC\n\nand which were deposited by Mdm Tan in Hua Ann were not gifts by her to Hua Ann. As I have\n\nmentioned, she was a creditor for each of the sums so deposited and, prima facie, she and\n\nher estate would have had a claim for those monies, as well as the purchase monies,\n\nagainst Hua Ann.96.        \n\nTong Djoe, as one of her beneficiaries (as she died intestate) would also, prima facie,\n\nbenefit from those claims. However, if Tong Djoe himself has a valid claim to the third\n\nlevel of 18 NC against Hua Ann by reason of the monies he has provided, then that would be\n\na sort of double-counting against Hua Ann. The fact that Tong Djoe has chosen not to seek\n\nmonetary compensation in exchange for his alleged right is immaterial. The point is that\n\nhe would be entitled to seek such compensation were I to conclude that he has the right he\n\nclaims. I would add that I am not aware of the current position between Mdm Tan’s\n\nestate and Hua Ann. There may well have been developments since 18 NC was transferred to\n\nHua Ann and since Mdm Tan deposited the monies and these developments may in turn affect\n\nthe account as between Mdm Tan and Hua Ann. That is a separate matter which is not before\n\nme.97.        I\n\nwould also add that the cases cited by Mr Woo in support of Tong Djoe’s claim had\n\ndifferent facts which do not come close to those before me.98.        In\n\nthe circumstances, it is not necessary for me to reach a conclusion on another argument\n\ntaken by the liquidator of Hua Ann i.e that Tong Djoe’s claim is contrary to the\n\nprovisions of the Residential Property Act (Cap 274). I would only say that Tong\n\nDjoe’s claim is not that of a bare licensee and it may well be that his claim would\n\nhave, in any event, run afoul of the Residential Property Act.",
        "SUMMARY": "99.        \n\nThis is not a case of an old man being kicked out onto the streets without a place to stay\n\nin. That is the picture which Tong Djoe and his witnesses were painting. As I have said,\n\nat all material times, Tong Djoe was and is not staying at the third level of 18 NC. He\n\nspends part of his time in Indonesia, and, when he is in Singapore, he is staying\n\nsomewhere else. The real reason for his claim is his dissatisfaction with some of his\n\nchildren and, in particular, Keng Hiang. The fortunes of Hua Ann have plummeted and Tong\n\nDjoe believes that Keng Hiang will cause the sale of 18 NC, the last substantial asset of\n\nHua Ann, at a time when property prices have come down. During the trial, he expressed his\n\nunhappiness about the price at which 26 TA was sold, which he felt was too low (NE 7 and\n\nNE 41). Moreover, he is also afraid that his children will spend away the money which they\n\nwill receive from the sale of 18 NC (see his AEIC para 111 and NE 58).100.        \n\nAlthough I find Keng Hiang to be rude, ungrateful and pretentious, the burden of proof is\n\non Tong Djoe as the plaintiff. For the reasons I have stated, I find that he has failed to\n\ndischarge his burden. In the circumstances, I dismiss Tong Djoe’s claim. I will hear\n\nthe parties on costs.101.        I\n\nwould add one observation. It came to my attention during the trial that the liquidator\n\nhad mentioned in his first report the substance of an offer that was made without\n\nprejudice by Tong Djoe’s solicitors to his solicitors. In cross-examination, the\n\nliquidator did not agree that he should not have done this. I am of the view that the\n\nliquidator should not have mentioned the substance of the offer in his report. Having done\n\nso, he and his solicitors should have blanked out that part of his report on the substance\n\nof the offer before they used his report.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
