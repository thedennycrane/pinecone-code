        "The appeal": "6       The appellants filed Originating Summons No 1158\n                    of 2010 (“the OS”) on 11 November 2010 appealing against the Award\n                    and prayed for it to be set aside and for the Commissioner’s decision to\n                    be reversed. Two grounds for the appeal were set out in the OS. First, it was\n                    said that the Commissioner was wrong to have reversed the burden of proof. This\n                    ground required an analysis of s 3 of the Act. Second, it was alleged that the\n                    Commissioner reached the wrong finding of fact. This ground concerned the\n                    application of s 29(2A) of the Act.",
        "First ground of appeal: reversal of the burden of proof": "7       An employer’s liability for compensation\n                    is imposed by s 3(1) of the Act which reads: Employer’s liability for\n                        compensation 3. – (1) If in any employment personal\n                        injury by accident arising out ofandin the\n                        course of employment is caused to an employee, his employer shall be liable\n                        to pay compensation in accordance with the provisions of this Act. [emphasis added] Section 3(1) must be read with s 3(6) which states: (6) For the purposes of this Act, anaccidentarisingin the courseof an employee’s employment shall be deemed, in the absence of\n                        evidence to the contrary, to have arisenout\n                            ofthat employment. [emphasis added] 8       Section 3(6) is very much a local innovation. It\n                    was not present in the Act’s predecessor the Workmen’s Compensation\n                    Ordinance (9 of 1932) and was added only in the Workmen’s Compensation\n                    Ordinance (31 of 1954) as s 4(5). The presumption was described by the Acting\n                    Commissioner for Labour (Proceedings of the Second\n                        Legislative Council of the Colony of Singapore,\n                        4thSession 1954/1955, (15 June 1954) at B142)\n                    as: Perhaps the most important change proposed is in the law itself. Under the\n                        existing legislation a workman, to obtain compensation, has to prove that\n                        the accident arose both out of and in the course of his employment. Under\n                        the present proposals the workman must still prove that the accident arose\n                        in the course of his employment, but the onus of proving that it did not\n                        arise out of his employment will rest on the employer if he holds that the\n                        claimant is not entitled to benefit. 9       Section 4(5) (as it was) did more than simply\n                    create a rebuttable presumption for the employee’s benefit. It also\n                    unintentionally clarified the local position on two issues of interpretation\n                    arising from what is now s 3(1). First, it was now clear that “arising\n                    out of” and “arising in the course of” are two separate and\n                    distinct concepts. This pertinent distinction stands in contrast to a line of\n                    cases which suggested that “arising out of and in the course of”\n                    could be regarded as asingleterm of art. InMcLauchlan v Anderson[1911] SC 529, a man\n                    stumbled and fell as he climbed down from his wagon to retrieve a pipe which he\n                    had dropped. The wagon ran over and killed him. The Lord President conceded the\n                    theoretical distinction between “arising out of” and\n                    “arising in the course of” but said (at 532) that: In a great many cases, however, the two phrases do not admit of separate\n                        consideration; and the present is one of those cases. If this accident took\n                        place in the course of the workman’s employment, it also indubitably\n                        arose out of that employment; if not, not. 10     Second, it was also clear from the wording of\n                    s 4(5) (as it was) that it is theaccidentalone\n                    that has to arise out of and in the course of the employment. This is in\n                    contrast to the House of Lords decision inFenton v J Thorley\n                        & Co., Limited[1903] AC 443 where Lord Macnaghten held that\n                    (in relation to the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1897) the phrase\n                    “injury by accident” was intended to be a compound phrase (at\n                    448): Then comes the question, Do the words “arising out of and in the\n                        course of the employment” qualify the word “accident”\n                        or the word “injury” or the compound expression “injury\n                        by accident”? I rather think the latter view is the correct\n                        one. 11     The consequence of s 3(6) is that, as the\n                    judge inNTUC Income Insurance Co-operative Ltd and another v\n                        Next of kin of Narayasamy s/o Ramasamy, deceased[2006] SGHC 162\n                    (at [20]) (“theNTUC Incomecase”) observed, s 3(1) requires the\n                    employee to prove three conditions: (a)     he has suffered a personal\n                        injury; (b)     the\n                        injury was caused by an accident; and (c)     theaccidentarose out ofandin the course of his\n                        employment. 12     The first condition was not disputed by the\n                    appellants: the personal injury suffered by the deceased was his death. The\n                    second condition was alsonotin dispute. The\n                    appellants conceded that the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia which caused the\n                    death was an “accident” within the meaning of s 3(1). In other\n                    words, the parties were in agreement that the respondents had shown that the\n                    personal injury (death) was caused by an accident (cardiac arrest/lethal\n                    arrhythmia). The only point of contention was whether the third condition had\n                    been satisfied – the appellants argued that the respondents had not proven\n                    that the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia arose out ofandin the course of the deceased’s employment. This is\n                    where s 3(6) of the Act comes into play. Once it is proven that the accident\n                    arosein the courseof employment, it will be\n                    presumed that the accident also aroseout ofhis\n                    employment. The operation of s 3(6) effects a limited shift of the burden of\n                    proof from the respondents to the appellants by requiring the employer to show\n                    that although the accident arosein the courseof\n                    employment, it nonetheless did not ariseout ofthe employment. 13     It was the appellants’ case that since\n                    the respondents had not proven that the accident arosein the\n                        courseof employment, the Commissioner was wrong toapplythe presumption under s 3(6) and, if the\n                    presumption did not apply, the Commissioner should not have shifted the burden\n                    of proof onto the appellants. The success of this appeal hinged entirely on the\n                    question of law: what does “arising in the course of employment”\n                    mean? 14     Courts have, over the decades, grappled with\n                    the meaning of the phrase “arising out of and in the course of\n                    employment”. The relationship between the two arms of the phrase was well\n                    described by Lord Finlay LC in the House of Lords’ case ofCharles R Davidson and Company v M’Robb or Officer[1918] AC 304 where he said (at 314 – 315): “Arising out of the employment” obviously means arising out\n                        of the work which the man is employed to do and what is incident to it\n                        – in other words, out of his service. “In the course of\n                        employment” must mean, similarly, in the course of the work which the\n                        man is employed to do, and what is incident to it – in other words, in\n                        the course of his service... The words “and in the course of” were probably added for\n                        this reason. If the nerve or agility of a workman were impaired by the\n                        conditions of his work and in consequence he met with an accident in the\n                        street which he would have avoided but for the impairment of his health\n                        occasioned by his work, the accident might be said to arise “out of\n                        the employment”. The same thing might be said in the case of an\n                        accident which he would have escaped but for fatigue induced by working\n                        overtime. The introduction of such claims is prevented by the words\n                        “in the course of the employment.” Such an accident as above\n                        suggested, though it may arise out of the work, would not be in the course\n                        of the work. 15     On the authorities, it is clear that an\n                    accident arisingout ofthe employment requires a\n                    causal connection between (i) the employment (and its incidents) and (ii) the\n                    accident. A direct or physical causation is not necessary:Smith v The Australian Woollen Mills Limited(1933) 50 CLR 504\n                    per Starke J at 517-518. But the causative standard is higher than the\n                    “but for” test. The accident must have arisen because of some\n                    intrinsic risk in the nature of the employment. As Lord Sumner put it inLancashire and Yorkshire Railway v Highley[1917] AC 352 (at 372): Was it part of the injured person’s employment to hazard, to suffer,\n                        or to do that which caused his injury? 16     In contrast, an accident arises in the course\n                    of the employment if it bears a temporal relationship with the employment. A\n                    simple test would be whether the accident occurs, as a matter of common sense,\n                    while the employee is at work. An elaboration of this test was provided by Lord\n                    Wright inWeaver v Tredegar Iron and Coal Company,\n                        Limited[1940] AC 955 (at 973): It has long been held that the course of the employment is not determined\n                        by the time at which a man is actually occupied on his work. There may be\n                        intermissions during the working hours when he is not actually working as,\n                        for instance, times for meals or refreshments, or absences for personal\n                        necessities. And the course of the employment may begin or end some little\n                        time before or after he has downed tools or ceased actual work. 17     Keeping in mind the reasoning of the\n                    abovementioned authorities, the appellants’ contention that an accident\n                    only arisesin the courseof employment if there\n                    is a causative link between the two is clearly misconceived. Further, the two\n                    authorities relied upon by the appellants did not assist them. The first wasOrmond v C D Holmes & Co Ltd[1937] 2 All\n                    ER 795. The case was irrelevant as it turnedsolelyon whether the second attack was an\n                    “accident” under the Workmen’s Compensation Act 1925 (at 800\n                    and 807). The second was an English Court of Appeal decision inHawkins v Powells Tillery Steam Coal Company, Limited[1911] 1 KB 988 (“Hawkins”). The\n                    critical issue there was whether the heart attack that killed the employee had\n                    beencausedby his employmentorother factors. The Court of Appeal held it was not caused by\n                    the employee’s work in a colliery but by his own diseased heart condition.\n                    Consequently,Hawkinsdoes not support the\n                    appellants’ contention. If it does, it should be taken to have been\n                    overruled by the subsequent two House of Lords cases cited above at[14]and[16]. 18     In the present case, it was undisputed that\n                    the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia that killed the deceased occurred while he\n                    was at work. It follows that the accident arosein the\n                        courseof his employment. Hence the Commissioner was entitled to\n                    find that pursuant to s 3(6) of the Act, the burden of proof shifted to the\n                    appellants to prove that the accident hadnotarisenout ofthe deceased’s employment.\n                    Consequently, I dismiss the first ground of appeal.",
        "Second ground of appeal: the Commissioner’s finding of\n                fact": "19     The Commissioner, after weighing the competing\n                    evidence had concluded as a fact that the appellants had failed to rebut the\n                    presumption under s 3(6) of the Act. The appellants contended that the\n                    Commissioner’s finding of fact was wrong. The appellants are faced with s\n                    29(2A) of the Act which reads: Appeal from decision of Commissioner ... (2A) No appeal shall lie against any order unless a substantial question\n                        of law is involved in the appeal and the amount in dispute is not less than\n                        $1,000. 20     As Kan Ting Chiu J observed inKaruppiah Ravichandran v GDS Engineering Pte Ltd and\n                        another[2009] 3 SLR(R) 1028, s 29(2A) reflects the policy that\n                    decisions of the Commissioner are not to be examined as though they are\n                    decisions of a court of law. The purpose of the Act must be kept in mind. As the\n                    Minister said (Singapore Parliamentary Debates,Official Report(22 January 2008) volume 84 at\n                    column 259): Workmen’s Compensation Act or WCA provides a simpler and quicker way\n                        to settle compensation claims by avoiding protracted legal\n                        proceedings. 21     Kan Ting Chiu J was therefore correct in\n                    emphasising (at [16]) that findings of\n                    fact fall within s 29(2) only if they are findings thatnoperson would have come to if he had applied the law properly.\n                    The standard is higher than a manifestly wrong finding of fact. So the question\n                    that arises is whether the Commissioner’s finding that the presumption\n                    under s 3(6) was not rebutted was one thatnoperson would have come to if he had properly applied the relevant\n                law. 22     The evidence before the Commissioner may be\n                    summarised as follows: There was some dispute over how strenuous the\n                    deceased’s work was. On one side was the evidence of Lee that the work he\n                    and the deceased were engaged in was strenuous. It was Professor Lau’s\n                    opinion that strenuous work coupled with the deceased’s heart condition\n                    was the reason for the cardiac arrest/lethal arrhythmia. That was so even though\n                    the deceased collapsed only some time after he had begun his break. On the other\n                    side was the arm-chair evidence of the deceased’s supervisors and managers\n                    that the work the deceased did was not strenuous. It was Dr Singh’s\n                    opinion that the deceased’s heart condition was generally benign, and that\n                    his collapse was best explained by an inexplicable and random occurrence of\n                    “sudden death syndrome”. The Commissioner preferred the evidence\n                    of Lee and Professor Lau because Lee being a co-worker had personal experience\n                    of the nature of the deceased’s duties and because Professor Lau appeared\n                    to be the more reliable witness. This was clearly not a decision which no person\n                    would have come to had he properly applied the relevant law. 23     The appellants in their closing submissions\n                    before the Commissioner (at [59]) had argued that “a litigation\n                    lawyer’s work entails far greater challenges physically (not to mention\n                    mentally) given their need to carry heavy voluminous documents to court”.\n                    This flippant and insensitive submission should never have been made; it was a\n                    mockery of the sanctity of life and would have greatly upset the respondents had\n                    they come to know of it. 24     In light of the observations in [22], it follows that the appellants’\n                    second ground of appeal was outside the ambit of s 29(2A) of the Act and must\n                    also be dismissed. 25     Before I conclude this judgment, I should\n                    address one final issue. Counsel for the appellants had raised a preliminary\n                    issue at the commencement of the hearing. He submitted that the Commissioner had\n                    written his grounds of decision (dated 21 February 2011) with one eye on the\n                    grounds of appeal as was evident where he said (at [35]): In the preparation of my Grounds of Decision, I have had the opportunity\n                        to peruse OS 1158/2010 by filed the Respondents containing the grounds of\n                        their appeal. In summary, the Respondents assert that the decision in favour\n                        of the claimants is wrong for the following broad reasons: aI had failed to appreciate that the burden in\n                            proving each and every ingredient of this claim under Section 3(1) of\n                            the Work Injury Compensation Act lies with the Claimants and not the\n                            Respondents; bI had erred in law and in fact by preferring the\n                            evidence of Dr Lau over Dr Singh and thereby finding that the death\n                            arose out of and in the course of employment. The Commissioner then proceeded to deal with the issues listed at\n                    (a) and (b). Counsel for the appellants complained that the Commissioner’s\n                    grounds of decision had wrongly embarked on anex post\n                        factoanalysis to refute the appellants’ grounds of appeal.\n                    He submitted that the right course of action should have been for the grounds of\n                    decision to simply expand on the Commissioner’s brief oral grounds.\n                    Consequently, he requested the court to disregard the Commissioner’s\n                    “irregular” grounds of decision in its entirety as it amounted to\n                    a justification of the Commissioner’s decision – the court should\n                    only refer to the notes of evidence and submissions. 26     Whilst it was indeed unfortunate that the\n                    Commissioner referred to the OS in his grounds of decision, that by itself was\n                    no reason for the court to disregard the document altogether. All that was\n                    required was for the court to ignore the offending paragraph. Without that, the\n                    decision could still stand on its own. In this regard, the old case ofLoh Kwang Seang v Public Prosecutor[1960] MLJ 271cited\n                    by the appellants has no relevance. This can be seen from holding no. 4 in that\n                    case which reads: It is not permissible for a trial court having signed and delivered its\n                        grounds of decision to the appellants to supplement the grounds of decision\n                        or amplifying them in any way. The conduct of the learned President in\n                        amplifying his grounds by adding a further 27 lines of typewritten material\n                        to it was both irregular and improper but it was not such conduct as can be\n                        said to have occasioned a miscarriage of justice or such as could be said to\n                        warrant or require or even justify the trial being regarded a nullity and\n                        the conviction being quashed. In our case, the Commissioner did not issue his grounds of decision\n                    before 21 February 2011. By definition, he could not be accused of supplementing\n                    anypreviousgrounds of decision. More\n                    importantly, the issues in the grounds of decision substantively reflected his\n                    oral grounds. The Commissioner only said (see N/E 99): I rule in favour of the [respondents]. Brief oral grounds. The burden of\n                        proof was mainly on the [appellants] as the deceased passed away in the\n                        course of employment. Ultimately, the physical efforts of the deceased too proximate to the time\n                        of death. On the issue of medical evidence, I prefer to the evidence of Dr\n                        Lau. His position takes into account the fact that physical condition differ\n                        from person to person. This is as opposed to Dr Singh who categorically\n                        insists on this 10 minute timeframe. Even on this 10 minute timeframe, he\n                        departs and cannot hold the position. Ultimately, the level of proof required is on a balance of probabilities\n                        and not beyond a reasonable doubt and I find that the [respondents] have\n                        proved their case so. Contrary to the appellants’ submission, the Commissioner’s\n                    grounds of decision did amplify his brief oral grounds. He did not as they\n                    complained, make “ade factoRespondents’ Case in answer to the Grounds of\n                Appeal”.",
        "Conclusion": "27     Consequently, I dismiss the OS with costs to\n                    the respondents to be taxed unless otherwise agreed."
