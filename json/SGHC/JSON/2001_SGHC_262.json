        "BACKGROUND": "1. In this application PT Garuda Indonesia ('Garuda'), a company organised under the\n\nlaws of Indonesia, is the Plaintiff. Birgen Air, a company incorporated under the laws of\n\nthe Republic of Turkey, is the Defendant.2. By an Aircraft Lease Agreement dated 20 January 1996 between Birgen Air and Garuda,\n\nBirgen Air agreed to lease one DC10-30 aircraft to Garuda ('the Lease Agreement').3. Subsequently, a dispute arose between the parties arising from Birgen Air's\n\nintention to substitute the aircraft that was to be leased to Garuda.4. The dispute was referred to arbitration in which Garuda was the Claimant and Birgen\n\nAir was the Defendant.5. The venue of the hearing of the arbitration was Singapore. The hearing was on 4, 5\n\nand 6 August 1999.6. Subsequently a final award called the Award Sentence dated 15 February 2000 was\n\nrendered ('the Award'). The Award was signed by two members of the tribunal i.e Dr Croft\n\n(from Australia) and Professor Inan (from Turkey). The third member, Dr Abdurrasyid (from\n\nIndonesia), declined to sign it.7. Later, the majority of the tribunal rendered an Addendum to Final Award dated 18 May\n\n2000 ('the Addendum').8. The majority of the tribunal also rendered a Decision With Respect to Final Award on\n\n21 November 2000 ('the Decision').9. Garuda then filed a Notice of Originating Motion on 3 January 2001 in the High Court\n\nof the Republic of Singapore to set aside the Award and/or the Addendum and/or the\n\nDecision and for various relief.10. On 27 March 2001, Garuda applied ex-parte for leave to serve the Notice of\n\nOriginating Motion on Birgen Air out of Singapore and also for leave to serve by\n\nsubstituted service within Singapore.11. The application was filed pursuant to O 69A r 4 read with O 11, and O 62 r 5 of the\n\nRules of Court. I was informed that Garuda had dropped its reliance on Order 11 at the ex\n\nparte hearing of its application.12. On 30 March 2001, an Order of Court was made by an assistant registrar in terms\n\nsubstantially, but not entirely, as prayed for in Garuda's application.13. Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Order state:'3. Leave be given to the Plaintiff to effect service of the Notice of Originating\n\n  Motion on the Defendant, Birgen Air, by sending a copy of the Notice of Originating Motion\n\n  together with a copy of the Order of Court dated this 30th day of March 2001, by express\n\n  courier, to the Defendant's solicitors at:Donald H. Bunker and Associates Suite 1606 Al Reem Tower Al Maktoum Road P.O. Box 29726\n\n    Dubai United Arab Emiratesand also by posting similar copies of the Notice of Originating Motion and Order of\n\n  Court on the Notice Board of this Honourable Court and such service shall be deemed good\n\n  and sufficient service of the said Notice of Originating Motion on the Defendant; 4. Leave\n\n  be given to the Plaintiff to effect service of the Notice of Originating Motion on the\n\n  Defendant, Birgen Air, by serving a copy of the Notice of Originating Motion together with\n\n  a copy of the Order of court dated this 30th day of March 200 (sic), on the Defendant's\n\n  solicitors in Singapore at: M/s Wee Ramayah & Partners 5 Shenton Way #23-01 UIC\n\n  Building Singapore 068808and such service shall be deemed good and sufficient service of the said Notice of\n\n  Originating Motion on the Defendant.'14. On 7 April 2001, Birgen Air applied, inter alia, to set aside the Order and all\n\nother subsequent proceedings including services of the Notice of Originating Motion and\n\nother documents.15. On 26 July 2001, after hearing arguments, I set aside the Order and all other\n\nsubsequent proceedings including services of the Notice of Originating Motion and other\n\ndocuments pursuant to the Order with costs.16. Garuda has appealed against my decision.17. In the application by Birgen Air, Mr Vangat Ramayah for Birgen Air raised various\n\narguments.18. As I was able to reach a decision without going into all of Mr Ramayah's arguments,\n\nmy Grounds will be in respect of some of his arguments only.",
        "MATERIAL NON-DISCLOSURE": "19. Mr Ramayah submitted that Garuda had a duty to make full and frank disclosure in\n\nits application for leave under O 69A r 4. He relied on a decision by Kan Ting Chiu J in\n\nTransniko Pte Ltd v Communication Technology Sdn Bhd[1996] 1 SLR 580for this\n\nproposition. That was a case for leave to serve a writ out of jurisdiction under O 11. Kan\n\nJ said, at p 583G, 'The duty on the applicant is onerous, and if he fails to discharge it,\n\nthe leave granted may be set aside even if the non-disclosure is innocent'.20. Mr K S Rajah SC and Mr Lawrence Quahe who appeared for Garuda did not dispute the\n\nduty to make full and frank disclosure nor that the leave granted could be set aside even\n\nif the non-disclosure is innocent. Neither was it disputed that this proposition equally\n\napplies to an ex parte application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction under O 69A r 4.21. However, Mr Quahe submitted that I also had the discretion not to set aside the\n\nleave granted if there was material, but innocent, non-disclosure, citing Brink's-MAT Ltd\n\nv Elcombe & others [1988] 3 All ER 188 which was a case involving an ex parte\n\napplication for a Mareva Injunction. In any event, Mr Ramayah did not dispute that I had\n\nthe discretion not to set aside the leave granted even if there was material, but\n\ninnocent, non-disclosure.Was there material non-disclosure?22. Order 69A r 4 states:'Service out of jurisdiction of originating process (O.69A, r.4)4(1) Service out of the jurisdiction of the notice of an originating motion or the\n\n    originating summons or of any order made on such motion or summons under this Order is\n\n    permissible with leave of the Court whether or not the arbitration was held or the award\n\n    was made within the jurisdiction.(2) An application for the grant of leave under this Rule must be supported by an\n\n    affidavit stating the ground on which the application is made and showing in what place or\n\n    country the person to be served is, or probably may be found; and no such leave shall be\n\n    granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to the Court that the case is a\n\n    proper one for service out of the jurisdiction under this Rule.(3) ….' [Emphasis added.]23. Mr Ramayah submitted that although the requirements under O 69A r 4(1) and (2) are\n\nnot identical with O 11 r 2(1) and (2), they are similar and hence the case-law on what\n\nconstitutes a proper case for service out of jurisdiction under O 11 r 2(2) should\n\nlikewise apply to O 69A r 4(2).24. Order 11 r 2(1) and (2) states:'Manner of application (O.11, r.2)2. (1) An application for the grant of leave under Rule 1 must be made by an ex parte\n\n  summons in chambers supported by an affidavit in Form 12 stating -(a) the grounds on which the application is made;(b) that in the deponent's belief the plaintiff has a good cause of action;(c) in what place or country the defendant is, or probably may be found;(d) where the application is made under Rule 1(c), the grounds for the deponent's\n\n    belief that there is between the plaintiff and the person on whom an originating process\n\n    has been served a real issue which the plaintiff may reasonably ask the Court to try; and\n\n    (e) whether it is necessary to extend the validity of the writ.(2) No such leave shall be granted unless it shall be made sufficiently to appear to\n\n  the Court that the case is a proper one for service out of Singapore under this Order.'\n\n  [Emphasis added.]25. As can be seen, the requirements of O 11 r 2(1)(a) and (c) are similar to those in\n\nO 69A r 4(1). More importantly, both O 11 r 2(2) and O 69A r 4(2) require the Court to be\n\nsatisfied that the case is a proper one for service out of jurisdiction.26. However, Mr Quahe disagreed with Mr Ramayah. Mr Quahe submitted that O 11 r 2(1)\n\nand (2) was prohibitive whereas O 69A r 4(1) and (2) was discretionary. Also, O 11 dealt\n\nwith writs issued within Singapore unlike O 69A. He submitted that the authorities on a\n\nproper case under O 11 r 2(2) do not apply as regards a proper case under O 69A r 4(2).27. Mr Quahe submitted that so long as the supporting affidavit contains the material\n\nmentioned in O 69A r 4(2), the application would be a proper case for service out of\n\njurisdiction. That is why the supporting affidavit for Garuda sought to establish the\n\naddress of Birgen Air only as that was the requirement under O 69A r 4(2). Mr Quahe cited\n\nOverseas Union Insurance Ltd v Incorporated General Insurance Ltd [1992] 1 Lloyd's Law\n\nReport 439 ('the OUI case') to support his submissions. However that is a case on the\n\nEnglish equivalent of our O 11 and not O 69A. It seemed to me that Mr Quahe was blowing\n\nhot and cold.28. Interestingly, the passage that Mr Quahe was relying on in the OUI case was also\n\nthe passage which Mr Ramayah was relying on.29. The passage is at p 447 to 448 of the report where Parker LJ said: 'Where then does\n\nall this lead? It leads in my view to this, that there is only one requirement, namely\n\nthat it shall be made sufficiently to appear that the case is a proper one. There is one\n\noverall scheme of which the elements are a case on the merits, fulfilment of one or more\n\nof the qualifying conditions, and England being the most appropriate forum in the sense\n\nthat England is the forum in which the case can most suitably be tried in the interests of\n\nall the parties and for the ends of justice. As to the last see Spiliada Maritime\n\nCorporation v Cansulex Ltd., [1987] 1 Lloyd's Rep. 1; [1987] A.C. 460.'30. I was of the view that this passage did not support Mr Quahe's submissions. It did\n\nnot say that so long as the other requirements in O 69A r 4(2) were satisfied, the Notice\n\nof Motion would be one that is a proper case for service out of jurisdiction.31. Furthermore the sentence which states that there is only one requirement should be\n\nread in the context of the entire passage. The one requirement pertains to the requirement\n\nof a proper case. Fulfilment of one or more of the qualifying conditions, for an\n\napplication under O 11, must still be satisfied and there must also be a case on the\n\nmerits.32. It seemed to be that the guide for a proper case under the Singapore O 11 r 2(2)\n\nwas that the forum chosen must be the most appropriate forum in which the case can most\n\nsuitably be tried in the interests of all the parties and for the ends of justice.33. As Rajendran J put it succintly in Kishinchand Tiloomal Bhojwani v Sumil\n\nKishninchand Bhojwani[1997] 2 SLR 682at p 690, O 11 r 2(2) embodies the forum non\n\nconveniens rule.34. I was also of the view that case-law as to what constitutes a proper case under O\n\n11 r 2(2) is persuasive as to what constitutes a proper case under O 69A r 4(2) as the\n\nrequirement of a proper case is identical in both provisions and both provisions deal with\n\nthe question of service out of jurisdiction.35. It was common ground that the place of arbitration was an important factor in\n\ndetermining whether the Notice of Motion was a proper one for service out of jurisdiction.36. It was also common ground that the place of arbitration was also important in\n\nrespect of another factor i.e. whether Part I of the International Arbitration Act (Cap\n\n143A) (\"the Act\") and the 1st Schedule thereto incorporating the Model Law was\n\napplicable in principle.37. The 1st affidavit of Reggy Hadiwidjaja filed on 27 March 2001 was the supporting\n\naffidavit for Garuda's ex parte application for leave to serve out of jurisdiction.38. Paragraphs 12 to 14 thereof state:'12. The arbitration was heard in Singapore. Singapore was the seat of the arbitration.\n\n  The procedural aspect of the conduct of the arbitration (as distinguished from the\n\n  substantive agreement to arbitrate) is determined by the law of the place or seat of the\n\n  arbitration which is Singapore in this case. The parties hereby submitted themselves to\n\n  the law of the place of the arbitration and to the supervisory jurisdiction of the High\n\n  Court of the Republic of Singapore.13. The parties stipulated that the arbitration between them will be conducted in\n\n  accordance with the International Chamber of Commerce International Court of Arbitration\n\n  1988 Rules. The ICC Rules govern the conduct of the arbitration except insofar as they\n\n  conflict with the mandatory requirements of the procedural law of the seat of the\n\n  arbitration which is set out in the IAA.14. The award in question, handed down by the International Chamber of Commerce\n\n  International Court of Arbitration, is by its terms and implications governed by the law\n\n  of Singapore. The Singapore High Court has jurisdiction in respect of procedural matters\n\n  concerning the conduct of the arbitration.' [Emphasis added.]39. It was clear to me that the deponent had assumed that because the hearing of the\n\narbitration was in Singapore, Singapore was the place or seat of the arbitration. The\n\ndeponent had also made a sweeping statement that the Award is \"by its terms and\n\nimplications\" governed by the laws of Singapore.40. The affidavit did not disclose Clauses 16.8 and 16.9 of the Lease Agreement.\n\nClauses 16.8 and 16.9 state:'16.8 Governing Law. This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed\n\n  in accordance with, the laws of the Republic of Indonesia, including all matters of\n\n  construction, validity and performance.16.9 Arbitration. In the event that a commercial controversy or claim between the\n\n  parties exists at the time the Aircraft is redelivered to LESSOR at the expiration or\n\n  termination of this… Agreement for the payment of money only (excluding casualty\n\n  claims for physical injury, death or property damage arising out of accidents, occurrences\n\n  or events whether or not such casualty claims are covered by insurance) arising out of or\n\n  relating to this Agreement or any breach thereof, such controversy or claim shall be\n\n  settled by arbitration held before a board of three qualified arbiters. The parties agree\n\n  that such arbitration shall be held in Jakarta, Indonesia and conducted in the English\n\n  language in accordance with the Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the International\n\n  Chamber of Commerce. Judgement upon any award rendered by such arbitration may be entered\n\n  in any court having jurisdiction thereof.' [Emphasis added.] 41. Secondly, the affidavit\n\n  did not disclose Clauses 6, 7 and 8 of the Terms of Reference. Clauses 6, 7 and 8 state:'6. Place of Arbitration6.1 The place of arbitration is Jakarta, Indonesia.6.2 The Arbitral Tribunal and the Parties may convene at any other location if\n\n    necessary, for example, for a view.6.3 …7. Applicable Law7.1 The law governing the contract, the Lease and the substantive rights of the parties\n\n    is to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal subject to the provisions of the Lease\n\n    Agreement.7.2 The law governing the arbitral procedure (if any) is to be determined by the\n\n    Arbitral Tribunal.8. Applicable Procedural Rules8.1 The Rules governing the proceedings shall be those resulting from ICC Rules of\n\n    Arbitration and, where those Rules are silent, any rules which the Parties, or failing\n\n    them, the Arbitrators, may settle.8.2 Without limitation to their other powers, the Arbitrators may make procedural\n\n    orders from time to time and may vary, amend and revoke such procedural orders.8.3 ….' [Emphasis added.]41. It was clear from these provisions from the Lease Agreement and the Terms of\n\nReference that, prima facie, the place of arbitration was Jakarta and the governing law of\n\nthe substantive dispute is the law of Indonesia.42. Before me, Garuda's case was that the place of arbitration was subsequently changed\n\nfrom Jakarta to Singapore and that this change was effected by faxes/correspondence of the\n\nparties and the arbitral tribunal.43. However the faxes/correspondence was also not disclosed in the 1st affidavit of Mr\n\nHadiwidjaja.44. Fourthly, the last page of the Award states the following:'This Award has been signed by a majority of the members of the Arbitral Tribunal by\n\n  reason of the fact that Professor Dr H Priyatna Abdurrasyid declined to sign.'DATED: 15 February 2000Jakarta' [Emphasis added.]45. It seemed to me that the last page of the Award had indicated Jakarta, as the place\n\nof arbitration, in accordance with Article 31(3) of the Model Law. However, the last page\n\nof the Award was also not disclosed.46. Fifthly, para 39 of the Award states:'What law governs the Arbitral procedure (if any and to be determined)?39. It was not suggested otherwise by the parties and it is the Arbitral Tribunal's\n\n  view that the procedural rules applicable to this arbitration are contained in the ICC\n\n  Rules.At this point it is noted that although the place of the arbitration was originally\n\n  agreed as being Jakarta the parties agreed, for convenience, to hold a hearing on 4, 5 and\n\n  6 August 1999 in Singapore. It had not been suggested by either of the parties, nor is it\n\n  the view of the Arbitral Tribunal, that the use of Singapore as a convenient place for the\n\n  hearing had any substantive or procedural impact on the proceedings.' [Emphasis added.]47. This was also not disclosed. 49. All the omitted information had a material bearing\n\nas to whether the place of arbitration was Singapore or not. At the very least, it\n\ndemonstrated that the original place of arbitration was not Singapore. There was material\n\nnon-disclosure by Garuda.48. Whether the leave to serve out of jurisdiction should remain notwithstanding\n\nmaterial non-disclosure49. I was of the view that the supporting affidavit had given the impression that all\n\nalong the place of arbitration was Singapore. The application for leave had proceeded on\n\nthe wrong premise.50. In such circumstances, I did not think that I should exercise my discretion in\n\nfavour of Garuda. I was of the view that the leave should be set aside on the ground of\n\nmaterial non-disclosure alone. However, my Grounds will also cover some more substantive\n\narguments.",
        "WHETHER THIS WAS A PROPER CASE FOR LEAVE AND WHETHER THERE WAS ANY\n\nJURISDICTIONAL BASIS FOR THE ORIGINATING MOTION": "51. Mr Ramayah submitted that the place of arbitration was not Singapore.52. He submitted that, if he was correct, then, (a) this was not a proper case for\n\nleave and (b) there was no jurisdictional basis for the Originating Motion. He did not go\n\ninto the substantive merits of the Originating Motion.53. Both these points involve overlapping considerations and I will deal with them\n\ntogether.54. As I have said, Garuda is a company organised under the laws of Indonesia. Birgen\n\nAir is a company incorporated under the laws of Turkey.55. The aircraft was leased for the Hajj Term, as defined in the Lease Agreement. The\n\nAmerican currency was the currency of payment.56. Therefore neither the parties nor the purpose of the lease of the aircraft nor the\n\ncurrency of payment had any substantial connection with Singapore.57. The only alleged substantive connection with Singapore was that the hearing of the\n\narbitration took place in Singapore.58. As I have mentioned, it was alleged before me that the place of arbitration was\n\nchanged to Singapore by agreement and that this change was effected by faxes/\n\ncorrespondence of the parties and the arbitral tribunal. I will now come to the faxes/\n\ncorrespondence.59. By a fax dated 24 February 1999, Dr Croft (the Chairman of the arbitral tribunal)\n\nwrote to the solicitors of the parties. The last paragraph states:'Consequently the Tribunal orders that the Plaintiff produce the documents in\n\n  accordance with the Defendant's Application for an Order for Discovery of Documents dated\n\n  14 December 1998 on or before 15 March 1999. The Tribunal otherwise confirms its Orders as\n\n  set out in my letter of 27 April 1998. Accordingly, the Tribunal proposes to fix a hearing\n\n  date and arrangements for the hearing in late July or early August 1999. Would the parties\n\n  please indicate suitable dates between 26 July and 3 September 1999. As to the place of\n\n  the hearing the Tribunal is of the view that Jakarta is not an appropriate place given the\n\n  current situation in Indonesia and proposes to sit in Zurich instead.' [Emphasis added.]60. The reply from Donald H Bunker & Associates ('Bunker & Associates'), the\n\nsolicitors for Birgen Air on 11 March 1999 did not comment on the proposed change of the\n\nvenue of the hearing.61. The reply from Gani Djemat & Partners ('Gani & Partners'), the solicitors\n\nfor Garuda, on 12 March 1999, stated, inter alia,'As regards the venue of arbitration and the proposed fixed date thereof the Claimant's\n\n  comments will follow.' [Emphasis added.]62. On 30 March 1999, Dr Croft wrote to the solicitors for the parties. The last\n\nsentence of his fax states:'…. The Arbitral Tribunal otherwise reaffirms the Orders as set out in my letter\n\n  of 24 February 1999 save that as a result of correspondence between members of the\n\n  Arbitral Tribunal is (sic) now proposed to hold the hearing in Singapore rather than\n\n  Zurich.' [Emphasis added.]63. On 7 April 1999, Bunker & Associates replied. The material part of their reply\n\nstates:'2. In the event that the Tribunal does not grant Birgenair's request for a decision\n\n  based on the documents, Birgenair requests that the hearing take place from September 1,\n\n  1999 to September 3, 1999 and confirms that it is in agreement with the view of the\n\n  Tribunal that Jakarta is not an appropriate place for the hearing and accepts the\n\n  Tribunal's proposal to sit in Singapore.' [Emphasis added.]64. By a fax dated 21 May 1999 to the solicitors of the parties, Dr Croft stated, inter\n\nalia:'…. In this respect I formally notify the parties that the Arbitral Tribunal has\n\n  decided that this matter will be heard on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in Singapore and the\n\n  parties should proceed in accordance with procedural orders already made for a hearing on\n\n  those dates.' [Emphasis added.]65. On 10 June 1999, Gani & Partners replied to state, inter alia:'The Position of the Claimant is as follows:1. The Claimant agrees that the hearing to take place on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999 in\n\n  Singapore. 2. …. 3. …. 4. ….' [Emphasis added.]66. On 23 July 1999, Dr Croft wrote to the solicitors of the parties stating, inter\n\nalia:'The Arbitral Tribunal has considered the submissions on behalf of the parties on the\n\n  question whether or not to hold a hearing and has decided that a hearing should be held\n\n  because in all the circumstances it will provide the most expeditious and effective means\n\n  for the parties to present their cases to respond to each other's case. It would also, in\n\n  all the circumstances, provide the Arbitral Tribunal with the most effective means of\n\n  questioning and clarifying issues with the parties with respect to aspects of their cases.\n\n  Finally, the Arbitral Tribunal is of the view that it would be necessary for its members\n\n  to meet in any event to discuss issues raised in these proceedings which means that the\n\n  expense of arrangements for such a meeting would be incurred in any event. Accordingly, a\n\n  hearing will take place in Singapore for up to three days on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999. As\n\n  indicated in the Orders for Directions contained in my letter of 22 April 1998 it is\n\n  envisaged that the parties will have equal time to present their cases and a draft agenda\n\n  is set out below. This draft agenda is subject to the further orders as set out in this\n\n  letter with respect to the attendance of witnesses and other arrangements with respect to\n\n  witnesses. Arrangements for the hearing are now being made by the Singapore representative\n\n  of the ICC. Details of the location of the hearing room and the times of the hearing will\n\n  be provided within the next few days.' [Emphasis added.]67. On 30 July 1999, Dr Croft wrote again stating, inter alia:'I refer to previous correspondence and now attach a copy of a letter from Mrs Sim Jee\n\n  Kim, Assistant Executive Secretary of the Singapore National Committee of the ICC noting\n\n  arrangements that have been made for the hearing of this matter on 4, 5 and 6 August 1999\n\n  in Singapore. ….' [Emphasis added.]68. In Naviera Amazonica Peruana S.A. v Compania Internacional De Seguros Del Peru\n\n[1988] 1 Lloyd's Rep 116 (the Peruvian Insurance case), Kerr LJ said at p 120 and 121:'Finally, as I mentioned at the outset, it seems clear that the submissions advanced\n\n  below confused the legal \"seat\" etc. of an arbitration with the geographically\n\n  convenient place or places for holding hearings. This distinction is nowadays a common\n\n  feature of international arbitrations and is helpfully explained in Redfern and Hunter at\n\n  p. 69 in the following passage under the heading \"The Place for Arbitration\":The preceding discussion has been on the basis that there is only one \"place\"\n\nof arbitration. This will be the place chosen by or on behalf of the parties; and it will\n\nbe designated in the arbitration agreement or the terms of reference or the minutes of\n\nproceedings or in some other way as the place or \"seat\" of the arbitration. This\n\ndoes not mean, however, that the arbitral tribunal must hold all its meetings or hearings\n\nat the place of arbitration. International commercial arbitration often involves people of\n\nmany different nationalities, from many different countries. In these circumstances, it is\n\nby no means unusual for an arbitral tribunal to hold meetings or even hearings in a place\n\nother than the designated place of arbitration, either for its own convenience or for the\n\nconvenience of the parties or their witnesses…. It may be more convenient for an\n\narbitral tribunal sitting in one country to conduct a hearing in another country for\n\ninstance, for the purpose of taking evidence …. In such circumstances each move of\n\nthe arbitral tribunal does not of itself mean that the seat of the arbitration changes.\n\nThe seat of the arbitration remains the place initially agreed by or on behalf of the\n\nparties.' [Emphasis added.]69. A similar passage is found in p 86 and 87 of the 3rd Edition, 1999, of Redfern and\n\nHunter and, contrary to paragraph 88 of Garuda's Reply Submissions, the last sentence\n\ncited above does appear in the 3rd Edition as well.70. Mr Rajah informed me that England has not adopted the Model Law. However, this did\n\nnot mean that the observation from Kerr LJ had ceased to apply.71. Indeed, the possibility of conducting an arbitration in different venues while\n\nretaining the place of arbitration is recognised in Article 20(2) of the Model Law. For\n\ncompleteness, I state below Article 20(1) and (2) of the Model Law:'Article 20. Place of arbitration(1) The parties are free to agree on the place of arbitration. Failing such agreement,\n\n  the place of arbitration shall be determined by the arbitral tribunal having regard to the\n\n  circumstances of the case, including the convenience of the parties.(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this Article, the arbitral\n\n  tribunal may, unless otherwise agreed by the parties, meet at any place it considers\n\n  appropriate for consultation among its members, for hearing witnesses, experts or the\n\n  parties, or for inspection of goods, other property or documents.'72. I would add that Mr Rajah placed some emphasis on Article 20(1) and (2) of the\n\nModel Law. I will try to summarise his arguments as I understand them.73. First, he stressed that under Article 20(1), the parties could agree to change the\n\nplace of arbitration. However, this was never in dispute.74. Secondly, he suggested that under Article 20(2), the arbitral tribunal could meet\n\nat different places. However, this was also never in issue.75. The point before me was whether the place of arbitration had changed just because\n\nthe venue of the hearing had changed. According to Kerr LJ and Article 20(2), this was not\n\nnecessarily so.76. The question before me was whether the parties had agreed to change the place of\n\narbitration.77. After considering the faxes/correspondence referred to above, I concluded that the\n\nparties had not changed the place of arbitration. Singapore became the venue of the\n\nhearing but the place of arbitration remained Jakarta.78. I was aware that the initiating fax dated 24 February 1999 from Dr Croft had\n\nreferred to 'the place of the hearing' but in my view this referred to the venue of the\n\nhearing and not the place of arbitration.79. Neither the parties nor the arbitral tribunal had contemplated changing the place\n\nof arbitration with the legal consequences which follow from such a change. They were\n\nconcerned only with a different aspect of the hearing i.e. the venue of the hearing.80. Garuda's counsel had wrongly assumed in the application for leave, and even in the\n\nhearing before me, that the venue of the hearing means the same thing as the place of\n\narbitration. While this may be linguistically acceptable, it is not acceptable in the law\n\nof international commercial arbitration under which the expression 'the place of\n\narbitration' has a certain legal meaning and consequence.81. The place of arbitration determines which law governs the arbitration. This is\n\nknown as the lex arbitri or curial law and is not the same as the law governing the\n\nsubstantive dispute or what is known as the proper law of the contract.82. According to Redfern & Hunter 3rd Edition at p 83, 'It is sometimes said that\n\nthe lex arbitri is a law of procedure'. However, the authors suggest that it includes\n\nmatters more than just procedural law, although not the law governing the substantive\n\ndispute.83. My conclusion that the place of arbitration remained Jakarta is reinforced by para\n\n39 of the Award, which I have cited in para 47 above, and the fact that the Award\n\nindicates the place of arbitration as Jakarta, see paras 45 and 46 above.84. As regards the submission for Garuda that the use of the Singapore representative\n\nof the ICC demonstrated that the arbitral tribunal was looking to Singapore for\n\nadministrative and legal support and hence the place of arbitration had changed, I did not\n\nagree.85. The arbitral tribunal was looking to the Singapore representative of the ICC in\n\nSingapore for administrative support but there is nothing to suggest that this included\n\nlegal support. Furthermore, it is only logical that administrative support would be\n\nprovided at the venue of the hearing. It does not mean that whenever this is done, the\n\nvenue of the hearing becomes the place of arbitration.86. In addition, the adoption of ICC Rules does not mean that the place of arbitration\n\nmust be Singapore. The ICC Rules were already adopted under Clause 16.9 of the Lease\n\nAgreement and Clause 8.1 of the Terms of Reference (see paras 40 and 41 above). I would\n\nadd that the adoption of the ICC Rules does not displace the curial law. If the ICC Rules\n\ndo not cover a point, then the parties may look to the curial law.87. Accordingly, in respect of another argument for Garuda, the fact that Bunker &\n\nAssociates had relied on Article 14.3 of the ICC Rules to seek an arbitration on the basis\n\nof documents is neither here nor there.88. However, Mr Rajah raised yet another point. He submitted that if Singapore was not\n\nthe place of arbitration, then difficulties could have arisen. For example, if the\n\narbitral tribunal had to seek the assistance of the court on a procedural matter like the\n\nissue of a subpoena, which court should it turn to? As the hearing was in Singapore, a\n\nsubpoena by a court in Jakarta would not be effective. On the other hand, s 12(6) read\n\nwith s 12(1) of the Act provides that the Singapore High Court has the power to make\n\nvarious orders or give directions to assist the arbitral tribunal (although I note that\n\nthe power to issue a subpoena is not specifically mentioned).89. In my view, the possibility of difficulties arising only means that the parties\n\nshould have considered whether to change the place of arbitration from Jakarta to\n\nSingapore. It does not mean that the place of arbitration must be changed. If the parties\n\nhave not agreed to change it, the place of arbitration remains Jakarta with all the\n\ndifficulties which this might have given rise to.90. In any event, the hearing of the arbitration has been concluded.91. As I have determined that the place of arbitration remained at Jakarta, Singapore's\n\nconnection with the arbitration became more tenuous. It was clear to me that Singapore was\n\nnot the most appropriate forum to challenge and set aside the Award and/or the Addendum\n\nand/or the Decision. The most appropriate forum was Jakarta. Even Turkey was a more\n\nappropriate forum than Singapore, provided Turkey has jurisdiction to hear the challenge.92. In addition, Garuda was intending to rely on a ground stated in Article 34(iv) of\n\nthe Model Law, as incorporated by Part I of the Act, to make its challenge. The Model Law\n\napplies as the First Schedule to the Act. However, before Article 34(1) can apply, Garuda\n\nhad to satisfy first the requirement in Article 1(2) of the Model Law which states:'(2) The provisions of this law, except Articles 8, 9, 35 and 36, apply only if the\n\n  place of arbitration is in the territory of this State.' [Emphasis added.]93. As the place of arbitration is not Singapore, neither Article 34 of the Model Law\n\nnor, for that matter, Part I of the Act, will apply. Whether the Model Law would apply by\n\nvirtue of some other foreign legislation is another matter.94. Counsel for Garuda had assumed that because the arbitration was heard in Singapore,\n\nPart I of the Act must apply. This is not so. Part I of the Act applies only if (a) the\n\narbitration is an international arbitration within the meaning of s 5 of the Act, (b) the\n\nplace of arbitration is Singapore, and (c) the parties have not excluded its application\n\nby agreement.95. Alternatively, Part I can apply if the parties agree that it should.96. I come now to s 15 of the Act which states:'15. If the parties to an arbitration agreement have (whether in the arbitration\n\n  agreement or in any other document in writing) agreed that any dispute that has arisen or\n\n  may arise between them is to be settled or resolved otherwise than in accordance with this\n\n  Part or the Model Law, this Part and the Model Law shall not apply in relation to the\n\n  settlement or resolution of that dispute.'97. Mr Rajah submitted that under s 15 of the Act, the parties could agree to exclude\n\nPart I of the Act or the Model Law and since they had not done so, the Model Law would\n\napply. Consequently, this would mean that Garuda could make its application in Singapore\n\nto set aside the Award, the Addendum and the Decision. I did not agree.98. As I have stated, Part I of the Act and the Model Law apply only if, in the first\n\nplace, the place of arbitration is Singapore. It is then open to the parties to exclude\n\nthe application of Part I and the Model Law by agreement.99. Section 15 did not allow either party to circumvent the concept of the place of\n\narbitration or Article 1(2) of the Model Law.100. I next refer to s 24 of the Act. It states:'24. Notwithstanding Article 34(1) of the Model Law, the High Court may, in addition to\n\n  the grounds set out in Article 34(2) of the Model Law, set aside the award of the arbitral\n\n  tribunal if -(a) the making of the award was induced or affected by fraud or corruption; or (b) a\n\n    breach of the rules of natural justice occurred in connection with the making of the award\n\n    by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.' [Emphasis added.]101. It was submitted for Garuda that the High Court of Singapore could set aside the\n\nAward, and the Addendum and the Decision under s 24(b) of the Act even if Article 34 of\n\nthe Model Law does not apply. 103. I disagreed. In view of the words in s 24 which I have\n\nemphasized, I was of the view that s 24 is linked to Article 34(1) in that if Article\n\n34(1) is not applicable because the place of arbitration was not Singapore, then, s 24\n\nalso would likewise not be applicable.102. In other words, s 24 is applicable in principle only if Article 34 is applicable\n\nin principle. When Article 34 is applicable in principle, an applicant may rely on the\n\ngrounds stated in Article 34(1) or in s 24.103. Accordingly I was of the view that there was no jurisdictional basis for the\n\nOriginating Motion to be filed in Singapore. However, this does not mean that there is no\n\nsubstantive merit in the challenge by Garuda. As I have said, Mr Ramayah did not address\n\nme on the substantive merits of the challenge which will have to be dealt with in some\n\nother jurisdiction.",
        "Other Submissions": "104. Counsel for Garuda also referred me to Articles 12 and 26 of the ICC Rules and\n\nvarious passages from International Commercial Arbitration in UNCITRAL Model Law\n\nJurisdictions, First Edition, by Peter Binder. It was also submitted that under s 4(1) of\n\nthe Act, reference may be made to certain documents to interpret the Model Law. With\n\nrespect, I did not find these submissions to be of assistance.",
        "SUBSTITUTED SERVICE IN SINGAPORE": "105. There is one other argument I should deal with. The earlier Order by the assistant\n\nregistrar had also granted leave to effect service of the Notice of Originating Motion by\n\nsubstituted service on Birgen Air by serving a copy of the said Notice and of the Order on\n\nBirgen Air's Singapore solicitors, Wee Ramayah & Partners.106. Mr Ramayah submitted that if Garuda fails to make out a case for leave to serve\n\nout of jurisdiction under O 69A r 4, then it cannot apply for substituted service whether\n\nwithin or outside the jurisdiction of Singapore. He referred to two cases.107. The first case, in chronological order, was Fry v Moore [1889] 23 QBD 395. The\n\nhead-note states:'A writ was issued in the general form, without the leave of the Court, against a\n\n  person who at the date of the writ was out of the jurisdiction. The plaintiff obtained an\n\n  order for substituted service of the writ within the jurisdiction, and, having served the\n\n  writ in accordance with the order, signed judgment against the defendant for default of\n\n  appearance. The defendant took out a summons asking that the judgment might be set aside,\n\n  and that the plaintiff might be ordered to deliver a statement of claim.'108. Lindley LJ said at p 396 to p 397:'… But then the plaintiff obtained an order for substituted service on the\n\n  defendant's brother, who had been acting for him in some matters, and the writ was served\n\n  on the brother. Was this right or wrong? Looking at the various rules relating to service\n\n  out of the jurisdiction, I do not think this precise case has been provided for. But there\n\n  are certain principles which govern the rules, and in Field v. Bennett (6) the Queen's\n\n  Bench Division laid down the principle, that, if a writ could not be served personally at\n\n  the time when it is issued, there cannot be substituted service. That is a sound\n\n  principle. You cannot affect a principal through an agent when you could not affect the\n\n  principal himself. If in such a case an order for substituted service could be made, the\n\n  process might very easily be abused. Nothing could be easier than to issue an ordinary\n\n  writ against a foreigner who was residing out of the jurisdiction, and then to obtain an\n\n  order for substituted service, and thus the very mischief at which the rules relating to\n\n  service out of the jurisdiction are directed would be brought back. Both principle and\n\n  authority are against such a practice. I think, therefore, that the order for substituted\n\n  service of the writ was a bad order.'109. The judge then went on to hold that the order for substituted service was an\n\nirregularity and not a nullity and was waived by the steps the defendant there had\n\nsubsequently taken.110. Mr Ramayah also referred to Lyon v. Syed Mahomed [1902-3] VII SSLR 1. In that case\n\nLeach J said:'The writ of summons in this action is a writ for service out of the jurisdiction and\n\n  is in the form prescribed, with this exception, viz.: that the words \"by leave of the\n\n  Court\" have been accidentally omitted from the printed portion.111. On the ex parte application of the Plaintiff, I made an order for substituted\n\nservice of this writ on the Defendant's Attorney in Singapore. The Defendant is a British\n\nsubject, he left Europe about March last, and his address is unknown.112. No leave was obtained to serve the writ out of the jurisdiction, and it is\n\ncontended that this was necessary before substituted service could be permitted. It is not\n\nnecessary in Singapore, as in England, to obtain leave to issue a writ for service out of\n\nthe jurisdiction.113. As I understand the practice as laid down in the cases cited in the Annual\n\nPractice, 1901, pp. 62 and 63, and especially Wilding v. Bean (2) (per Lord Esher),\n\nsubstituted service will only be allowed when (if there are no obstacles in fact) personal\n\nservice in law could be effected and in the case of substituted service out of the\n\njurisdiction in England, leave to issue a writ for service out of the jurisdiction (a step\n\nthat is unnecessary in Singapore) and to serve it, or notice on [sic] lieu, out of the\n\njurisdiction, must first be obtained before an order for substituted service will be made.\n\nIt must then be shown that circumstances render the leave you have obtained ineffectual:\n\nthen, as the law permits you to serve out of the jurisdiction, but the circumstances\n\nprevent such service, the Court will allow substituted service either within or without\n\nthe jurisdiction.'114. On the other hand, Mr Quahe submitted that the decision in Ng Swee Hong v\n\nSingmarine Shipyard Pte Ltd[1991] 2 MLJ 499suggests that the purpose for ordering\n\nsubstituted service of a document would be to bring the document to the notice of the\n\nperson to be served and this purpose had been achieved.115. While this may be so, the facts in Ng Swee Hong were different from those before\n\nme.116. In that case, the appellant was a co-guarantor to the plaintiffs who were\n\nship-builders and ship-repairers. He was resident in Singapore. After the Writ of Summons\n\nwas filed and while attempts were being made to serve it on him, his solicitors informed\n\nthe plaintiffs' solicitors that he had left Singapore. It was not alleged that he had left\n\nSingapore for good but that he was travelling extensively. His residential address was\n\nadmittedly still in Singapore. He was in contact with his family who were residing at the\n\nsame address in Singapore.117. He then instructed local solicitors to act for him to apply to set aside the order\n\nfor substituted service at his residential address in Singapore.118. It was in such circumstances that his application failed.119. According to the White Book 1999 para 65/4/17:'… If, however, the defendant goes abroad after the issue of the writ, and goes\n\n  with knowledge of its issue, whether or not he goes with intent to evade service, an order\n\n  for substituted service of the writ may be made (Jay v. Budd [1898] 1 Q.B.D. 12, and see\n\n  Trent Cycle Co. v. Beattie [1899] 17 T.L.R. 176, CA); and, semble, even if he goes abroad\n\n  before the issue of the writ, but goes with intent to avoid service, an order may be made\n\n  (Wilding v. Bean [1891] 1 Q.B. 100, CA).'120. However, the situation is different if a defendant was never within the\n\njurisdiction in the first place. I agree that in such a situation, leave must first be\n\nobtained to serve the writ out of jurisdiction, before an application for substituted\n\nservice is made. Otherwise it would be easy to circumvent O 11 rr 1 and 2 or, as in this\n\ncase, O 69A r 4.121. There is also another point. Order 62 r 5(1) on substituted service states:' 5. - (1) If, in the case of any document which by virtue of any provision of these\n\n  Rules is required to be served personally on any person, it appears to the Court that it\n\n  is impracticable for any reason to serve that document personally on that person, the\n\n  Court may make an order in Form 135 for substituted service of that document.' [Emphasis\n\n  added.]122. As Birgen Air is a foreign company, s 376(c) of the Companies Act (Cap 50) read\n\ntogether with O 69A r 4 should be considered. Section 376(c) of the Companies Act states:'376. Any document required to be served on a foreign company shall be sufficiently\n\n  served -(a) …(b) …(c) in the case of a foreign company which has ceased to maintain a place of business\n\n  in Singapore, if addressed to the foreign company and left at or sent by post to its\n\n  registered office in the place of its incorporation.'123. However, s 376(c) Companies Act probably does not apply because Birgen Air did not\n\nhave a place of business in Singapore in the first place and so it has not ceased to\n\nmaintain a place of business in Singapore.124. Coming back to O 62 r 5(1), it was for Garuda to show why it was impracticable to\n\nserve the Notice of Originating Motion personally on Birgen Air outside Singapore before\n\nit was entitled to obtain an order for substituted service.125. The supporting affidavit for Garuda i.e. the 1st affidavit of Mr Hadiwidjaja had a\n\nlong discourse on the alleged attempts at personal service of the Notice of Originating\n\nMotion on Birgen Air.126. First, the supporting affidavit alleged that Bunker & Associates had agreed to\n\naccept service but had changed their position. It did not elaborate how this was relevant\n\nto demonstrate impracticality in serving Birgen Air personally. I would mention that this\n\nallegation was denied in a subsequent affidavit by Mr Bunker but it was not necessary for\n\nme to rule on it.127. The supporting affidavit also mentioned that a cover letter dated 18 January 2001\n\nwith a copy of the Notice of Originating Motion was sent to Bunker & Associates and\n\ncopied to Birgen Air at its last known address. The cover letter asked whether Birgen Air\n\nwould appoint Singapore solicitors to accept service. The copy to Birgen Air was returned\n\nto Garuda's Singapore solicitors with the address on the envelope crossed out.128. Likewise, as regards another letter from Garuda's solicitors to Bunker &\n\nAssociates dated 26 January 2001 and copied to Birgen Air, the copy to Birgen Air was\n\nreturned with the last known address of Birgen Air on the envelope crossed out.129. The supporting affidavit also relied on certain notice provisions in Article 16.1\n\nof the Lease Agreement and para 2.1 of the Terms of Reference but in my view, those\n\nprovisions did not apply to the service of court documents. In any event, those provisions\n\nwere relied on by Garuda only for the purpose of establishing the address of Birgen Air.130. I also noted that even though letters sent to Birgen Air's last known address had\n\nbeen returned with the address crossed out, no attempt was made by Garuda to ascertain the\n\nregistered address of Birgen Air in Turkey or some other more current address there.131. The supporting affidavit ended with Garuda's allegation that no instructions had\n\nbeen given to Birgen Air's Singapore solicitors Wee Ramayah & Partners to accept\n\nservice and that Birgen Air was attempting to evade and/or delay service. However, it did\n\nnot say specifically that it was impracticable to effect personal service on Birgen Air.132. It was clear to me that Garuda had been relying more on its frustrations than in\n\ntrying to establish that it was impracticable to effect personal service on Birgen Air. It\n\nhad failed to establish such impracticability. 132. It was also clear to me that the leave\n\nto serve by substituted service in Singapore was granted as an ancillary relief to the\n\nmain part of the Order granting leave to effect service out of Singapore by sending a copy\n\nof the Notice of Originating Motion and of the Order by express courier to Bunker &\n\nAssociates in the United Arab Emirates. Had the application for substituted service in\n\nSingapore been made alone, it would have failed.",
        "SUMMARY": "133. Accordingly, I set aside the Order granting leave and all other subsequent\n\nproceedings including all services of the Notice of Originating Motion and other documents\n\npursuant to the Order with costs.",
