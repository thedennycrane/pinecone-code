        "Background": "3.    When the appellant’s motor vehicle, bearing\n\nregistration number SCV 7067K, was stopped by Central Narcotics Bureau (\"CNB\")\n\nofficers at the Woodlands Checkpoint in Singapore on 16 June 2001, he was the only person\n\nin the car. He had just driven from Johore Bahru to Singapore. When his car was searched\n\nat a car inspection pit, Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock discovered a plastic bag in the arm-rest\n\ncompartment of the rear seat of the car. Inside the bag were two brown envelopes\n\ncontaining a granular substance. The appellant was arrested and the bag and envelopes were\n\nseized.4.    Tests revealed that the two packets seized by the\n\nCNB contained not less than 23.43 grams of diamorphine with a confidence level of\n\n99.9999%.5.    After his arrest, the appellant gave a number of\n\nstatements to CNB officers. As he spoke Hokkien, his statements, and where relevant,\n\nquestions posed to him and his answers, were translated by an interpreter.6.    About two hours after his arrest, the\n\nappellant’s first statement was recorded when he was questioned by Inspector Omer Ali\n\nSaifudeen with the assistance of his interpreter, Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock. The English\n\ntranscript of part of this statement is as follows:Q. What is this? (pointing at the bundle)A. I think drugs….Q. What is it for? Why did you bring it in?A. \"Ah Meng\" asked me to bring in and give to \"Ah\n\n  San\".Q. How much does a packet like this cost?A. I don’t know. They gave me 1000 ringgit to bring this in.7.    The appellant was offered an opportunity to make a\n\nstatement when a charge was framed and read to him pursuant to section 122(6) of the\n\nCriminal Procedure Code. The consequences of remaining silent and the fact that the\n\npenalty, if convicted, was death, was explained to him. An interpreter, Mr Wu Nan Yong,\n\nwas present. The appellant elected to say nothing.8.    The appellant’s next statement was recorded\n\nwith the assistance of an interpreter, Mr Tan Chee Leong, on 21 June 2001. It included the\n\nfollowing paragraphs:1. On 16 June 2001, at about 11.10 pm, I was arrested at the Woodlands\n\n  Checkpoint. I was in my car, a white BMW SCV 7067K. At the rear seat, inside the armrest\n\n  compartment was a plastic bag.I knew there was drug inside the plastic bag.2. On 16 June 2001, at about 4 pm, I drove my car … into\n\n  Johore…. I went horse-betting at Merlin Tower. …. Then I proceeded for a\n\n  hair-cut. At this point in time, I received a call on my handphone from a man known as Ah\n\n  Meng. Ah Meng asked me to wait for him at the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook at 8-plus pm. He\n\n  also asked me to help him bring something into Woodlands, Singapore. He promised me\n\n  ringgit one thousand for the effort….3. At 8-plus pm, I went to the carpark in Jalan Ah Fook …. Ah Meng\n\n  came in a black car. I saw Ah Meng approaching towards my car with a plastic bag in his\n\n  hands. He opened the back door of my car, … opened the armrest compartment at the\n\n  rear sear, placed the plastic bag inside it. He asked me to bring the thing out.On\n\n  my part, I knew it was drug, possibly \"bae Hoon\".5. Ah Meng asked me to hand over the thing to a man known as Ah San. I\n\n  was told to drive my car to Woodlands KFC carpark. I do not know Ah San or his contact\n\n  number. Ah San would be the one to identify me. He knew my car number.6. At 10-plus pm, I drove my car to the Woodlands Checkpoint….\n\n  After that, I drove my car into Singapore ….8. …. Upon reaching the Arrival Inspection Bay, I was stopped by a\n\n  Malay CNB officer ….13. The officers then forcefully broke open the cover of the armrest\n\n  compartment. They then found the plastic bag inside. They took out the plastic bag. They\n\n  asked me if there wereany moredrugs. I said no.…(emphasis added)9.    On 22 June 2001, the appellant’s fourth\n\nstatement was recorded with the assistance of Mr Tan Chee Leong at around 2.10 pm. In it,\n\nthe appellant stated, inter alia, as follows:21. My previous statement of 21/6/2001 was read back to me in Hokkien\n\n  by a Chinese interpreter. I affirm the statement to be true and accurate. I do not wish to\n\n  add or change anything….29. When I was arrested, the Indian officer asked me what are these\n\n  things, pointing at the two packets of wrapping.I said drug. He then took a\n\n  knife and cut open one of the wrappers. He again asked me what are these.I said\n\n  drug. I told him Ah Meng asked me to give to Ah San.I told him Ah Meng\n\n  promised to give me ringgit one thousand.(emphasis added)10.    The only issue at the trial was whether the\n\nappellant knew that the two packets seized from him at Woodlands Checkpoint contained\n\ndrugs. The prosecution pointed out that apart from the evidence that the appellant was\n\naware that he had drugs in his possession, the effect of the presumptions in sections\n\n18(2) and 21 of the Misuse of Drugs Act was that he was presumed to be in possession of\n\nthe envelopes seized from him and that he knew that those envelopes contained drugs.11.    At the close of the prosecution’s case, the\n\nappellant’s counsel submitted that there was no case to answer. However, the trial\n\njudge ruled that there was a case to answer. When informed of this, the appellant elected\n\nnot to give evidence in court and no other evidence was tendered to advance his case. All\n\nthe same, his counsel pointed out that he should not be convicted because there was a\n\ndoubt as to whether or not he was the person who was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on\n\n16 June 2001 and there were inaccuracies in the recording of his statements to CNB\n\nofficers.12.    The appellant’s counsel pointed out that\n\napart from Assistant Superintendent Soh Thiam Loon, no one had identified the appellant as\n\nLim Choo Song or as the person mentioned in the statements of the witnesses. It was also\n\nalleged that the appellant’s passport and identity card were not identified in court\n\nby Sergeant Ng Beng Chin, the officer who seized these documents. However, the trial judge\n\nsaid that there was no doubt that the appellant was the person arrested at Woodlands on 16\n\nJune 2001. To begin with, when the charge was read to the appellant, he did not deny that\n\nhe was Lim Choo Song. In fact, he claimed trial. Furthermore, the appellant’s\n\ncounsel, who conceded that the appellant’s statements were admissible, posed\n\nquestions to Inspector Omer Ali Saifudeen and Sergeant Choo Thiam Hock on the basis that\n\nit was the accused who made the statements in question. During cross-examination, there\n\nwas no dispute that the appellant was the person arrested for having drugs in his car. The\n\ntrial judge also noted that the appellant had made it clear in his third statement to CNB\n\nofficers on 21 June 2001 that he was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 16 June 2001. In\n\nhis fourth statement, which was recorded on 22 June 2001, the appellant admitted that he\n\nwas driving the car bearing registration number SCV 7067K when he was arrested.13.    As for the attacks on the accuracy of the\n\ninterpretation of the statements, it was alleged that the appellant did not say in his\n\nfirst statement that the packets seized from him contained drugs. He had used a Hokkien\n\nword \"tok pin\", which meant poisonous substances and not drugs. The interpreter,\n\nSgt Choo, disagreed. However, Mr Tan Chee Leong, who interpreted the appellant’s\n\nstatements on two other occasions accepted, when cross-examined, that \"tok pin\"\n\ncould mean either poisonous substance or drugs. As for the appellant’s third\n\nstatement, which was recorded on 21 June 2001, the appellant’s counsel contended that\n\nthe appellant had not told the interpreter, Mr Tan, that he knew that there were drugs in\n\nthe plastic bag or that it was possibly \"Bae Hoon\". However, Mr Tan disagreed\n\nand said that if the accused had not used that Hokkien phrase, it would not have been\n\nrecorded in the statement. These alleged inconsistencies were not such as to persuade the\n\ntrial judge that the appellant had no case to answer.14.    The trial judge held that in view of the evidence\n\ntendered by the prosecution, the accused’s statements and his silence, the\n\nprosecution had proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.",
        "The appeal": "15.    In his written submissions for the appeal, the\n\nappellant’s counsel argued that the appeal should be allowed because the trial judge\n\nfailed to give the appellant the benefit of the doubt that he imported the drugs in\n\nquestion into Singapore on 16 June 2001 and failed to regard the appellant’s\n\nstatements to CNB officers as unreliable as their accuracy had been challenged. However,\n\nevents which unfolded before the hearing of the appeal made it impossible for the\n\nappellant’s counsel to rely on these grounds.16.    On 27 February 2002, the appellant filed Criminal\n\nMotion No 4 of 2002 for the purpose of obtaining an order that he be allowed to adduce\n\nfresh evidence to prove his innocence. For this purpose, he filed an affidavit on 26\n\nFebruary 2002, in which he stated that with regard to the matters set out in the charge\n\nagainst him, he was in fact gathering evidence for the Central Narcotics Bureau. However,\n\nwhen the Criminal Motion was heard, counsel for the appellant informed the court that he\n\nhad instructions to withdraw the Criminal Motion. Leave was given to the appellant to\n\nwithdraw the Criminal Motion and we proceeded to hear the appellant’s appeal against\n\nhis conviction.17.    By withdrawing his Criminal Motion to adduce\n\nfurther evidence, the appellant placed himself in a difficult position because he had, to\n\ndate, presented no evidence that he had been authorised to bring the drugs in question\n\ninto Singapore. The appellant’s counsel, Mr James Masih, accepted that the appellant\n\nhad admitted in his affidavit filed on 26 February 2002 that the drugs were in his\n\npossession, albeit for a different purpose. As such, the appellant was no longer in a\n\nposition to contend that there was a doubt as to whether he had brought the drugs into\n\nSingapore. No other argument was advanced as to why the appeal should be allowed. As such,\n\nthe appellant’s appeal was dismissed.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeSgd:CHAO HICK TINJudge of AppealSgd:Tan Lee MengJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
