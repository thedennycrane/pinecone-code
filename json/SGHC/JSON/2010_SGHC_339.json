        "The case law": "6       I first consider the several cases cited in\n                    argument, beginning with the local cases. Ms Subramanian relied on three cases\n                    for the relevant sentencing principles. 7       The first case isAG v Chee\n                        Soon Juan[2006] 2 SLR(R) 650 (“Chee Soon Juan”), where Lai J remarked that\n                    fines would no longer be the norm for the offence of scandalising the court.\n                    That case involved a statement that the Singapore judiciary was biased and\n                    unfair and acted at the instance of the government in cases involving opposition\n                    politicians. The statement was read aloud during court proceedings and then\n                    circulated to the media and other entities. In deciding on sentence, Lai J\n                    observed that the offence of scandalising the court had hitherto been punished\n                    with fines only, but went on to observe that: 59     It appeared at first sight that the\n                        present offences of contemptin facie curiaeby insulting the Judiciary as a whole before AR Low, and of contempt by\n                        scandalising the court, warranted a fine rather than a term of imprisonment.\n                        However, the present case can also be distinguished from all previous cases\n                        in which fines were imposed for acts scandalising the court. None of those\n                        cases involved situations where the contemptuous statements were actually\n                        readbeforethe court. This factor, coupled\n                        with the unfounded allegations made against the Judiciary, clearly rendered\n                        the acts of the Respondent as \"conduct calculated to lower the authority of\n                        the court\" which amounted to \"sheer, unmitigated contempt\" sufficient to\n                        warrant a sentence of imprisonment: (perYong\n                        CJ inRe Tan Khee Eng John([27]supra) at [14]). 60     The Respondent's conduct leading up to the\n                        present proceedings was clearly reprehensible. In addition, he was not\n                        contrite nor did he make any attempt to withdraw his offending remarks.\n                        Instead, he repeatedly maintained that he spoke the truth. As the SSG had\n                        submitted, a jail sentence was necessary so as to deter the Respondent from\n                        repeating, and like-minded persons from committing, similar acts in\n                        future. 61     For the reasons stated, I decided to and\n                        did impose a jail sentence of one day on the Respondent. It was to serve as\n                        a warning to others who chose to go down the Respondent's path that,\n                        henceforth, similar offenders can expect to be incarcerated and perhaps\n                        fined as well and, if the circumstances warranted it, sent to jail for\n                        longer periods too. Fines as the penalty for contempt of court of this\n                        nature will no longer be the norm. As Mr Ravi pointed out, it appears from the passages cited that\n                    Lai J’s dictum that fines will no longer be the norm must be read in\n                    the light of the learned judge’s finding thatChee Soon\n                        Juandiffered from previous cases in that the contempt was\n                    committed (partly) in the face of the court. Lai J’s dictum was also\n                    made with reference to recalcitrant offenders. 8       The second case isAG v\n                        Hertzberg[2009] 1 SLR(R) 1103 (“Hertzberg”), where Tay J expounded the\n                    relevant sentencing principles as follows: 57     The AG submitted that in\n                        assessing the proper sanction to be imposed on the third respondent, the\n                        following principles of sentencing would apply in the instant case: ... denunciation (to drive home the point that such behaviour is\n                            unacceptable), specific deterrence (to prevent a recurrence of such\n                            behaviour) and general deterrence (to signal to others that such\n                            behaviour will be dealt with severely). The AG pointed out that the third respondent is a repeat offender, having\n                        been fined $6,000 inZimmerman([13]supra) and $4,000 inWain([13]supra). The AG, suggesting that the previous\n                        fines were derisory in amount, submitted that a substantial fine, one that\n                        is sufficient to hurt but not to cripple, should be imposed.\n                        Mr Jeyaretnam, on the other hand, pointed out that our courts have been\n                        imposing fines in the region of a few thousand dollars with the highest\n                        amount ever awarded for the present form of contempt of court being $10,000\n                        inLingle([21]supra) at [64])[sic]. He submitted that if the third respondent was found\n                        liable for contempt of court, the fine imposed should not depart from the\n                        existing scale as laid down in the earlier cases. Anything more, he argued,\n                        would have an unnecessary \"chilling effect\" on speech and would not be\n                        needed to vindicate the honour and reputation of the courts. 58     I agree that the general sentencing\n                        principles referred to above are appropriate in determining the appropriate\n                        punishment for the criminal forms of contempt of court such as the present\n                        one of \"scandalising the court\" in the instant case. The factors that the\n                        court should have regard to in deciding the appropriate punishment are the\n                        nature of the contempt, who the contemnor is, the degree of his culpability,\n                        how the contempt was published, the kind of publication and the extent of\n                        the publication (seeZimmermanat [50]). Other\n                        relevant considerations would be whether the respondent argued against\n                        culpability, expressed regret over his conduct or made an apology for his\n                        contempt of court (see alsoWong Hong Toy([52]supra) at [46] andAG\n                            v Pang Cheng Lian[1974-1976] SLR(R) 271). As\n                        mentioned above (at [34]), whether the statements in question merely pose a\n                        remote possibility or present a real risk of harm to the administration of\n                        justice can also be taken into account in determining the sentence. The\n                        considerations are not exhaustive and what are of particular relevance would\n                        depend ultimately on the facts of each case. While the fines imposed in the\n                        earlier cases provide useful guides, each case should of course be dealt\n                        with on its own merits. InHertzberg, a $25,000 fine was imposed\n                    on the corporate contemnor. 9       The third case isAG v Tan\n                        Liang Joo[2009] 2 SLR(R) 1132 (“Tan Liang Joo”), where Prakash J gave her own\n                    summary of the applicable sentencing principles: 31     The penalty for contempt of court can take\n                        the form of either a fine or imprisonment and there is no limit on the\n                        amount of the fine or duration of imprisonment (AG v Chee\n                            Soon Juan([9]supra) at [57];Lee Hsien\n                            Loong v Singapore Democratic Party([9]supra) at [179]). In reaching a decision on\n                        the sentence, I bore in mind that \"[t]he object of imposing the penalty for\n                        the offence of scandalising the court is to ensure that the unwarranted\n                        statements made by the contemnor about the court or the judge are repelled\n                        and not repeated\" (Gallagher v Durackat 57).\n                        The relevant factors for consideration include: the nature and gravity of\n                        the contempt; the seriousness of the occasion on which the contempt was\n                        committed; the importance of deterring would-be contemnors from following\n                        suit; and the culpability of the contemnor (seeLee Hsien\n                            Loong v Singapore Democratic Partyat [179]-[180] and [222]).\n                        Fines as the penalty for scandalising the court are no longer the norm\n                            (AG v Chee Soon Juanat [61]). The\n                        appropriate sentence can only be determined by looking at the particular\n                        facts of each case (Soong Hee Sin v PP[2001]\n                        1 SLR(R) 475). InTan Liang Joo, the three respondents\n                    were wearing t-shirts imprinted with a picture of a kangaroo dressed in a\n                    judge’s gown within and in the vicinity of the Supreme Court building when\n                    an assessment of damages involving politicians was ongoing. One of the\n                    respondents wore the t-shirt on further occasions and posted photographs of the\n                    respondents wearing the t-shirts online. All the respondents refused to\n                    apologise after they were found to be in contempt. The last-mentioned respondent\n                    was sentenced to 15 days’ imprisonment while the other two were sentenced\n                    to 7 days’ imprisonment. 10     Also relevant are the penalties imposed in\n                    those cases where internationally-reputed publications such as Newsweek, the\n                    Wall Street Journal Asia and the International Herald Tribune have scandalised\n                    the courts by alleging bias and partiality in cases between politicians from the\n                    ruling party and the opposition:A-G v Pang Cheng\n                        Lian[1974–1976] SLR(R) 271;A-G v Zimmerman Fred[1985–1986] SLR(R) 476;A-G v Wain Barry J[1991]\n                    1 SLR(R) 85;A-G v Lingle[1995]\n                    1 SLR(R) 199 andHertzberg. In those\n                    cases, which predated Lai J’s dictum inChee Soon\n                        Juan, fines were imposed on both the corporate owners of the\n                    publications as well as the human agents involved in publication. Mr Ravi\n                    relied on these cases as examples where low sentences were\n                imposed. 11     Counsel also referred me to several foreign\n                    authorities. These are of course not sentencing precedents as such, but may be\n                    illuminating insofar as they touch on matters of principle and the proper\n                    sentencing approach to take in cases where the court has been\n                    scandalised. 12     The first case referred to by Ms Subramanian\n                    isSecretary for Justice v The Oriental Press Group\n                        Ltd[1998] HKCFI 564, which concerned a\n                    widely-circulated Hong Kong newspaper, the Oriental Daily News and its editor,\n                    amongst others. They were convicted for threatening, harassing and intimidating\n                    a judge, and for publishing seven articles over a month which vilified the\n                    judiciary with scurrilous remarks and racist slurs. This campaign was in\n                    response to a decision against the paper by the targeted judge in a separate\n                    proceeding. The Hong Kong Court of First Instance found both the editor and the\n                    company who owned the paper to be in contempt. 13     The court’s judgment on sentence is\n                    found in a separate judgment:Secretary for Justice v The\n                        Oriental Press Group Ltd[1998] HKCFI 173\n                        (“Oriental Press Group”). In\n                    respect of the editor, the court held that he must bear ultimate responsibility\n                    for the contents of the paper and the conduct of its staff, although the court\n                    suspected that the editor may have been influenced or encouraged by the board of\n                    the company which owned the paper. The editor had also apologised. After\n                    considering these and other factors, the court held that the editor should be\n                    jailed for 3 months in respect of the publications and 3 months in respect of\n                    harassing the judge, with 1 month of the latter sentence to run consecutively\n                    with the former sentence, making a total of 4 months. It is significant that the\n                    court adopted 8 months as the starting point, although it is not clear whether\n                    this was in respect of the publications or the harassment or both. 14     In respect of the company which owned the\n                    paper, the court held, in stern language, that: 15. We have noted the unreserved apology which the Oriental Press Group\n                        Ltd. has tendered. We have also read the guidelines (if they can properly be\n                        characterized as guidelines) which it has issued as to the form and content\n                        of articles appearing in theOriental Daily\n                            Newsto ensure that the law is not broken in the future.\n                        However, it is impossible for us to deal with the Oriental Press Group Ltd.\n                        other than by the imposition of a very heavy fine. We bear in mind that in\n                        the Group's consolidated accounts for the year ending 31st March 1997, the\n                        Group's profit after taxation was in the region of $208 million. We bear in\n                        mind also that fines are intended to punish the offender. They are meant to\n                        hurt. A fine which is merely an irritating annoyance represents hardly any\n                        punishment at all. In all the circumstances of the case, we believe that the\n                        proper fine to impose on the Oriental Press Group Ltd. for its contempt of\n                        court relating to the publication of the articles complained of in a\n                        newspaper with the largest readership in Hong Kong is one of $5\n                        million. 15     The editor’s appeal to the Court of\n                    Appeal was dismissed and the Court of Final Appeal refused leave to appeal\n                    further. 16     The second case isSecretary of Justice v Choy Bing Wing[2005] HKCFI 1125, where the respondent was convicted of scandalising\n                    a judge,vizRogers VP, with the intention and in\n                    the hope that it would result in the recusal of the judge from a proceeding he\n                    was involved in. His appeals against liability failed. In meting out a sentence\n                    of 6 months, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance considered that the\n                    respondent was “set on a calculated course of conduct to try and ensure\n                    that, with a tirade of abuse, he could obtain the result he desired; namely, to\n                    obtain the recusal of Rogers VP, and, by that result, to fashion the Court\n                    of Appeal to his own liking”:Secretary of Justice v\n                        Choy Bing Wing[2005] HKCFI 1159 (“Choy Bing Wing”) at [23]. 17     The third case isDurack v\n                        Gallagher(1982) 65 FLR 459. In that case, Gallagher, a\n                    union leader, had successfully appealed to the Full Court of the Federal Court\n                    of Australia against his conviction for contempt. In speaking to the media after\n                    his acquittal, Gallagher said: “I'm very happy to the rank and file of\n                    the union who has shown such fine support for the officials of the union and I\n                    believe that by their actions in demonstrating in walking off jobs ... I believe\n                    that that has been the main reason for the court changing its mind.”\n                    Fresh contempt proceedings were instituted, and Keely J, sitting as a single\n                    judge in the Federal Court, found Gallagher to be in contempt. In sentencing\n                    Gallagher to three months’ imprisonment Keely J made the following\n                    observations: Over a long period, the activities of the Federation [ie the union] and\n                        the sayings of Mr. Gallagher have been given much publicity by the\n                        news media. Mr. Gallagher is a public figure. He has been given every\n                        opportunity to explain his answer. He has not done so. He has shown no sign\n                        of remorse. He has expressed no regret to the Court. He has offered no\n                        apology to the Court. His conduct had a tendency to impair the confidence of\n                        the public in the court's judgments. It attacked the integrity, propriety\n                        and impartiality of the Court. The confidence of the public in the\n                        integrity, propriety and impartiality of the Court must be\n                        maintained. The contempt of court by Norman Leslie Gallagher warrants the\n                        imposition of a severe penalty. In all the circumstances it is not\n                        appropriate that a monetary penalty should be imposed. In any event it is\n                        all too easy for Mr. Gallagher to have a monetary penalty paid by\n                        'benefactors'. The punishment must take the form of imprisonment. In all the\n                        circumstances he must be sent to prison for three calendar months. In\n                        addition he will be ordered to pay the Attorney-General's costs. 18     Gallagher’s appeal to the Full Court of\n                    the Federal Court was dismissed:Gallagher v\n                        Durack(1982) 68 FLR 210. Gallagher then sought leave\n                    from the High Court to appeal against conviction and sentence inGallagher v Durack(1983) 152 CLR 238\n                        (“Gallagher v Durack”). The\n                    majority refused leave, and gave the following reasons at 245 in respect of\n                    sentence: An independent ground on which special leave to appeal was sought was that\n                        it was erroneous for the Federal Court to take into account as one of the\n                        reasons for imposing a sentence of imprisonment instead of a fine the fact\n                        that the court thought that the applicant would not pay a fine out of his\n                        own funds. Counsel relied upon cases in which it has been held that it is\n                        wrong to impose a sentence of imprisonment not because it is merited but\n                        because of a belief that the convicted person cannot pay a fine. Such cases\n                        however are quite distinguishable from the present, whose circumstances were\n                        most exceptional. The applicant, in the course of the interview, made it\n                        clear that the Federation would not pay the fine imposed upon it out of its\n                        ordinary funds, and it can be inferred from his further remarks that moneys\n                        to pay that fine would be provided by employers who could not afford to have\n                        industrial trouble with the union. The Full Court did not rely on the latter\n                        circumstance, although it was entitled to do so. The object of the\n                        imposition of a penalty upon a person convicted of contempt of court is to\n                        endeavour to ensure that the unwarranted statements which he has made about\n                        the court or a judge are repelled and will not be repeated. In the present\n                        case, the applicant, who did not go into the witness box to explain the\n                        meaning of his statement or his attitude towards its repetition, was given\n                        an ample opportunity to apologize to the court but has chosen not to do so.\n                        If the court comes to the conclusion that a person convicted of contempt of\n                        court will not personally suffer or be deterred by a fine, that is a matter\n                        which it may consider in imposing sentence. It is of course clear that the\n                        Federal Court reached its conclusion that a sentence of imprisonment should\n                        be imposed chiefly because of the gravity of the contempt, and that the\n                        matters to which reference has just been made provided only an additional\n                        consideration. 19     Reference should also be made to the vigorous\n                    dissent of Murphy J, who made a point on selective prosecution which is\n                    pertinent to an argument made by Mr Ravi. Murphy J held at\n                    252–253: 20. Special leave should also be granted to appeal against the sentence of\n                        three months' imprisonment. It is very rare for imprisonment to be imposed\n                        in a contempt of this kind where the court orders are not being wilfully\n                        disobeyed. (SeeDunbabin's Case(1935) 53 CLR,\n                        at p 448 ;Solicitor-General v. Radio Avon\n                        Ltd. (1978) 1 NZLR 225, at p 242 ;Dean's\n                            Case(1567) Cro Eliz 689, at p 690 [1653] EngR 589; (78 ER\n                        925, at p 926) .) The Federal Court observed that imprisonment was necessary\n                        because a fine would be no deterrent to Mr. Gallagher as it would\n                        be paid by others. Special leave would enable the Court to consider whether\n                        this represents a departure from proper principles of sentencing. The\n                        question is of public importance. It has grave implications for newspaper\n                        editors whose fines for contempt are paid for by newspaper companies. If the\n                        approach of the Federal Court on this question was wrong, the sentence\n                        should be reconsidered. 21. We were informed that Mr. Gallagher had no previous\n                        conviction for contempt of court or for anything else (except for refusal to\n                        answer before a Royal Commission in circumstances such that the Federal\n                        Court correctly decided to disregard it). In the light of the fact that\n                        normally fines only are imposed even for serious contempts in scandalizing\n                        the court, the sentence of three months' imprisonment appears to be a savage\n                        penalty. It would be unfortunate if this departure from the normal created\n                        the impression that imprisonment for scandalizing the court is reserved for\n                        militant trade union leaders. 22. Special leave would also enable consideration of another aspect which\n                        concerned the Federal Court. Although the statements emanated from\n                        Mr. Gallagher they were given national publicity by the media. Yet\n                        Mr. Gallagher alone has been prosecuted. If, as the Federal Court\n                        thought, the statements were a clear contempt, this is an instance of\n                        selective prosecution. The Federal Court noted that no explanation was\n                        advanced by the Attorney-General for proceeding only against\n                        Mr. Gallagher. The authority and standing of the Federal Court can only\n                        be lowered if it allows itself to become the vehicle of unexplained\n                        selective prosecutions for contempt of itself. The fact that no one else who\n                        participated is to be punished should have been an important factor in\n                        considering whether to sentence Mr. Gallagher to imprisonment (seeAttorney-General (N.S.W.) v. Mundey(1972)\n                        2 NSWLR 887). Although some attempt was made in this Court to explain the\n                        prosecution of Mr. Gallagher alone, it was not persuasive. 20     The fourth isRe\n                        Bauskis[2006] NSWSC 908, where the respondent was\n                    wearing a t-shirt with the slogan “Trial by jury is democracy”,\n                    and refused to remove the t-shirt or leave the courtroom when asked to do so. He\n                    also used abusive language against the judge and refused to apologise when\n                    committed for contempt. The judge took the view that the respondent, together\n                    with others, was attempting to intimidate him. He sentenced the respondent to 14\n                    days’ imprisonment:Re Bauskis[2006] NSWSC 907 (“Re\n                    Bauskis”). 21     Mr Ravi urged me to rely onR v Hoser[2001] VSC 443. In that case, the\n                    offending publication was a book attributing improper motives to judges in cases\n                    where the author had been convicted. The judge, Eames J, imposed a fine of\n                    $3,000 on the author and $2,000 on the company through which he published the\n                    book:R v Hoser[2001] VSC 480\n                        (“R v Hoser”). In declining to\n                    impose a term of imprisonment, Eames J agreed with counsel’s submission\n                    that many of the impugned passages in the book were found not to constitute\n                    contempt, that in examining the passages he (Eames J) had identified a number of\n                    important issues concerning the administration of justice, that the\n                    author’s integrity and credibility had already been adversely affected by\n                    the judge’s finding, that the author was motivated by a deep sense of\n                    grievance as to his convictions, and that the author would remove the offending\n                    passages in future editions of the book. This was notwithstanding the fact that\n                    the judge found that the book was widely disseminated, that the author and his\n                    company earned substantial profits from the publication of the book, that the\n                    author expressed no remorse for his actions, and that the judge had little\n                    confidence that the author would not repeat his acts of contempt. On appeal, the\n                    author was convicted in respect of more statements but no further penalty was\n                    imposed:Hoser v R[2003] VSCA 194. 22     Ms Subramanian also referred me to some\n                    decisions of our courts which were unaccompanied by grounds. In the absence of\n                    grounds I am unable to accord too much weight to those decisions.",
        "Application to the facts": "23     I would reiterate that the foreign authorities\n                    relied upon are not sentencing precedents as such, but are useful as\n                    illustrations of the sentencing approaches taken. In this regard, it is\n                    noteworthy that the High Court of Australia inGallagher v\n                        Duracksanctioned 3 months’ imprisonment for a public\n                    statement that the Federal Court had bowed to the power of the unions and not\n                    the law of the land. Similarly, the Hong Kong Court of First Instance inOriental Press Groupimposed a sentence of 3\n                    months for the scandalising publications in that case, which sentence was\n                    affirmed on appeal. These sentences show that the courts of those jurisdictions\n                    have not hesitated to give robust sentences where the facts warrant it. These\n                    sentences, I should add, are significantly higher than the 15 days imposed inTan Liang Joo, currently the highest sentence\n                    of imprisonment imposed in Singapore for scandalising the court. 24     However, to the extent that both counsel were\n                    referring to those authorities as benchmarks, I cannot, with respect, agree with\n                    them. In any case it would be difficult to reconcile the sentences in the\n                    Australian cases ofGallagher v DurackandR v Hoser, relied on by Ms Subramanian and\n                    Mr Ravi respectively, and it would be incongruous and inappropriate for a\n                    Singapore judge to reconcile Australian sentences. Further, inChoy Bing WingandRe\n                        Bauskis, the contempt was directed at ongoing proceedings. The\n                    part ofOriental Press Grouppertaining to the\n                    harassment of a judge is also not applicable here. However, in deference to\n                    Mr Ravi’s reliance onR v Hoser, I\n                    would say that, had the facts of that case been put before me, I would be\n                    disposed to give a much heavier sentence than that which was given in that\n                    case. 25     The general sentencing principles are well\n                    articulated in the local authorities cited above and are uncontroversial. There\n                    are two broad considerations. The first is the culpability of the contemnor and\n                    the need for specific deterrence. The second is the actual or potential effect\n                    of the contemning publication,iethe risk posed\n                    by the publication to public confidence in the administration of justice, and\n                    the need for general deterrence. 26     On the basis on the law as I have stated it in\n                    the main judgment, I would also hold that imprisonment would be the norm for the\n                    author of a publication which scandalises the court. To constitute contempt by\n                    scandalising, a publication must not only pose a real risk of undermining public\n                    confidence in the administration of justice; it must also fall outside the ambit\n                    of fair criticism, meaning that it is either made without rational basis, made\n                    without a honest and genuine belief as to its truth, or made in abusive\n                    language. The mere satisfaction of these criteria, without more, already makes\n                    for a high degree of culpability. The contemning author stands by definition in\n                    an area where his right of free speech has been abused and where the public\n                    standing of the courts should be vindicated. In the absence of special reasons,\n                    such as appropriate amends, the default punishment should be\n                    imprisonment.",
        "Effect of the book": "27     I first consider the effect of the book. The\n                    precise extent of circulation in Singapore is not established, although it is\n                    not disputed that the book is or was circulated in Singapore, and had sold a\n                    total of almost 6,000 copies in Singapore and overseas. There is also\n                    Mr Ravi’s candid statement during the hearing on liability\n                    that: In fact, in my office, I’ll be very honest, I’m not selling\n                        the book. I have -- so many lawyers have come to take the books because my\n                        client have provided a lot of copies from the distributors. I’m not\n                        selling it but I have given lawyers gratuitously at the -- my clients have\n                        been quite pleased that many lawyers are turning up in droves to buy -- to\n                        have a copy of the book. Some would like to just make payment at their\n                            volition.[note: 1] The impugned statements are also in a more enduring medium than\n                    journals or magazines,viza book. 28     I next consider the sheer breadth and gravity\n                    of Mr Shadrake’s allegations. As I said at [72] of the main judgment,\n                    “the more serious the allegation made, the greater the risk it poses to\n                    public confidence in the administration of justice, all other things being\n                    equal.” In this regard, Mr Shadrake’s allegations of judicial\n                    impropriety are without precedent in this jurisdiction in terms of their\n                    specificity, the number of judges targeted (the whole Supreme Court bench in\n                    Vignes Mourthi’s case) and their gravity, pertaining as they did to cases\n                    concerning the life and liberty of those who come before the courts. In\n                    particular they surpass the allegations made inChee Soon\n                        JuanandTan Liang Joo, where\n                    sentences of imprisonment were imposed. I briefly recapitulate some of\n                    Mr Shadrake’s key allegations: (a)     In discussing the case of Julia Bohl\n                        (the 2ndstatement), Mr Shadrake claimed\n                        that the courts gave a light sentence arranged for by the Singapore\n                        government under threat of economic reprisals by the German government.\n                        There was no rational basis supplied for this, and Mr Shadrake’s\n                        own source (Mr Anandan’s autobiography) clearly stated otherwise,iethat Julia Bohl could not face the\n                        death penalty because the amount of pure cannabis seized was only 281 grams\n                        and below the threshold of 500 grams. (b)     In discussing the case of Maria Krol-Hmelak and Peter\n                        Johnson (the 4thstatement), Mr Shadrake\n                        claimed that the courts succumbed to executive and diplomatic pressure in\n                        acquitting two accused persons in a capital case. In his affidavit,\n                        Mr Shadrake claimed he was referring to an abuse of prosecutorial\n                        discretion, not the judiciary. This was plainly unsustainable as the\n                        relevant sentence in the passage reads: “So it was very likelya government verdict not a judicial\n                        one” (emphasis added). During submissions, Mr Ravi\n                        supplied in support of the 4thstatement the\n                        wholly untenable basis that the trial judge, Lai Kew Chai J, had\n                        indicated that he would give written grounds for his decision but later did\n                        not do so. (c)     In\n                        discussing the cases of Dinesh Bhatia, Andrew Veale and Penelope Pang (the\n                            7thand 8thstatements), Mr Shadrake claimed that the rich and well-connected are\n                        shown favouritism and given light jail sentences, notwithstanding that\n                        Mr Anandan’s autobiography, which he claimed to rely on, also\n                        gave three instances (out of four) where fines were imposed for similar\n                        offenders who were certainly not rich or famous. He acknowledged that he had\n                        made a mistake in stating that Dinesh Bhatia faced the maximum sentence of\n                        10 years. This was impossible since Dinesh Bhatia was a first offender. But\n                        he did not and has not said anything about withdrawing an almost identical\n                        statement just immediately before the one he had acknowledged as\n                        erroneous. (d)     In\n                        discussing the case of Vignes Mourthi (the 9th,\n                            10thand 11thstatements), Mr Shadrake claimed that the Supreme Court judiciary has\n                        culpably suppressed possibly exculpatory evidence in a capital case,\n                        supplying only the completely untenable rationale that the Legal Service and\n                        the judiciary were “porous”. During submissions on sentence,\n                        Mr Ravi then put forward Mr Shadrake’s insincere\n                        “apology” referred to at[34]below. (e)     In the 1stand\n                            5thstatements, Mr Shadrake made further\n                        general statements alleging judicial impropriety in cases concerning the\n                        life and liberty of those who come before the courts. In general, he has\n                        shown himself to be more interested in make allegations against the\n                        judiciary than with criticising the analyses and outcomes in individual\n                        cases. 29     I now consider the likely effect on a member\n                    of the public who reads the book. Mr Shadrake does not have the reputation\n                    and ostensible credibility of some of the publications which have been found to\n                    be in contempt of our courts,egthe International\n                    Herald Tribune and the Wall Street Journal Asia. But he has presented himself as\n                    an investigative journalist, and the book is written in the style of a piece of\n                    investigative journalism. For example, at p 26 of the book, which I have set out\n                    at [85] of the main judgment, he says that: I wanted to expose some of the ghastly secrets of the gallows – the\n                        kind of secrets Singapore’s leaders are so proud of, revere, put so\n                        much faith in but don’t want anyone else to know about. Capital\n                        punishment in the tiny state had for far too long been shrouded in this kind\n                        of secrecy and discussion on the subject completely discouraged. It was time\n                        something was done about it in as dramatic a way as possible, I thought to\n                        myself. Could I be the one to expose the un-exposable? It would not be the\n                        first time I had rattled a few cages in high places with an equally\n                        embarrassing expose ... But being trained in journalism in the\n                        ‘publish and be damned’ way, I was determined to go ahead come\n                        what may. The average reader will not subject Mr Shadrake’s claim to\n                    being an investigative journalism or his allegations to searching criticism. He\n                    will read Mr Shadrake’s allegations much in the way they were\n                    presented in the Guardian article: While wealthy – often well-connected foreigners – can expect\n                        leniency, [Mr Shadrake] argued in Once the Jolly Hangman: Singapore's\n                        Justice in the Dock, the poor and disenfranchised are summarily\n                        executed. ... Drawing on interviews with a retired chief executioner, lawyers, former\n                        police officers and human rights activists, [Mr Shadrake’s]\n                        central claim is that justice in one of the world's most advanced economies\n                        is anything but blind. He highlights several inconsistent applications of\n                        the law which, he says, prove Singapore's judiciary \"picks and chooses how\n                        they respond depending on the state's diplomatic and economic\n                        interests\". I would therefore sentence Mr Shadrake on the basis that an\n                    average person who reads the book is likely to believe his\n                allegations. 30     Mr Ravi pointed out the Attorney-General\n                    has not taken steps to ban the book. He did not explain the legal basis on which\n                    the Attorney-General is bound to ban the book, and in any case I am not\n                    concerned in these proceedings with whether the Attorney-General should ban the\n                    book. But I do understand Mr Ravi to be making a point about what he sees\n                    as the incongruity of the Attorney-General’s actions here. Now, if this\n                    was a case where the Attorney-General has been improperly selective in\n                    prosecuting those who are involved in creating and distributing a scandalous\n                    publication, I can see some force in the dissenting judgment of Murphy J inGallagher v Durackthat this should count\n                    towards sentence. In fact, as Lord Reid explained inA-G v\n                        Times Newspaper Ltd[1974] 1 AC 273 at 289, the fact\n                    that others are free and are likely to make similar comments must be taken into\n                    account in assessing liability in the first place. The reason for this is easy\n                    enough to understand – if others are free to make scandalous remarks then\n                    the risk to public confidence cannot be said to emanate solely from the\n                    publication which is selectively prosecuted, and this would naturally be\n                    reflected in the sentence. 31     But on the facts there is simply no selective\n                    prosecution. As emerged during the various hearings before me, the\n                    Attorney-General had advised bookstores carrying the book to take legal advice,\n                    as a result of which the book has been taken off the shelves. This left\n                    Mr Shadrake, who was unwilling from the very start, despite several\n                    overtures by the Attorney-General, to retract his contemptuous publication and\n                    apologise to the court. I do not see how, on these facts, there could be said to\n                    be any sort of improperly selective prosecution. 32     In the same connection, Mr Ravi also made\n                    a point about how those involved in making the IBA report had not been\n                    prosecuted and punished for contempt. This ignores the facts. The relevant IBA\n                    conference had been held in Singapore in October 2007. The IBA report was\n                    released in July 2008, after some exchanges with the government and well after\n                    the conference had ended. So I am doubtful that those who were involved in\n                    making the report were within jurisdiction. But assuming in\n                    Mr Shadrake’s favour that they were within jurisdiction and not\n                    prosecuted, the fact remains, as I have made clear in [131] of the main\n                    judgment, that it was Mr Shadrake’s selective quotation of the IBA\n                    report, and his exaggeration of its conclusions, that placed him outside the\n                    scope of fair criticism. So this was not a case of Mr Shadrake being\n                    selectively prosecuted for repeating what the IBA was free to say.",
        "Culpability": "33     There is no doubt that\n                    Mr Shadrake’s personal culpability is of the very highest order. He\n                    has made sustained and extensive allegations of judicial impropriety in cases\n                    concerning life and liberty, and has done so without rational basis, and with\n                    reckless disregard as to the truth or falsehood of his allegations. He has in\n                    particular showed a tendency to distort his sources for his own\n                purposes. 34     Outside the courtroom Mr Shadrake has\n                    declared his complete lack of remorse, and discarded his pretence that he was\n                    not targeting the judiciary in the book. He has also asserted that his book was\n                    “devastatingly accurate”, despite everything I have said in the\n                    main judgment. Notwithstanding this, Mr Shadrake instructed Mr Ravi to\n                    inform me during the hearing on sentence that he did not mean to allege a\n                    cover-up by the “high echelons of the judiciary” in Vignes\n                    Mourthi’s case, despite his express words to the contrary in the book. In\n                    the light of this, his already misguided proposal to apologise must be regarded\n                    as nothing more than a tactical ploy to obtain a reduced sentence. 35     He is a first time offender, but that carries\n                    no weight at all in the light of the sustained allegations he has made in the\n                    book and his intention, stated through Mr Ravi in the face of the court,\n                    that he intends to produce a second edition of the book. This last fact is\n                    unprecedented in our case law, and calls for a strong element of specific\n                    deterrence in determining the sentence.",
        "Disgorgement of profit": "36     Questions had crossed my mind as to the\n                    motives of Mr Shadrake in writing this book. The bibliographical note on\n                    the back cover of the book does not show that he had a history of being an\n                    activist against the death penalty. Certainly, following from what I have said\n                    in the main judgment, it does not seem that he was overly concerned about\n                    ascertaining the truth or falsity of what he wrote. Notwithstanding his claims\n                    of meticulous research, the sources given by him during the hearing were mostly\n                    publicly available, and indeed one (the Chief Justice’s article) was\n                    published after his book. His style and tone is sensational in nature: seeegp 26 of the book, which I set out above at[29]. All these point to a man who is\n                    out to provoke controversy. But since these are suspicions on my part only, I\n                    disregard them for the purposes of sentencing. 37     However, I do have Mr Ravi’s\n                    statement that almost 6,000 copies of the book have been sold in total. I think\n                    that a fine should be imposed to prevent Mr Shadrake from profiting from\n                    his contempt. Let this be a signal that those who hope to profit from\n                    controversy by scandalising the court may expect to have their profits disgorged\n                    by a stiff fine, in addition to such other punishment as may be\n                imposed.",
        "Other factors": "38     Mr Ravi informed me that Mr Shadrake\n                    has had surgery for colon cancer. He has a history of coronary artery disease\n                    and had undergone successful angioplasty/stenting. He has also been suffering\n                    from hypertension for over 30 years. While the cancer is now in remission,\n                    Mr Shadrake still needs to go for annual checkups for polyps. Applying the\n                    principles stated by Rajah JA inChng Yew Chin v\n                        PP[2006] 4 SLR(R) 124, I do not think that\n                    Mr Shadrake’s medical condition justified the exercise of judicial\n                    mercy. His condition was not severe and would not be aggravated by the term of\n                    imprisonment contemplated here. Ms Subramanian also informed me that\n                    Mr Shadrake would be able to receive appropriate medical attention in\n                    prison if necessary. 39     Mr Ravi urged me to consider the possible\n                    effect of the sentence I pass on a proposed tie-up between Yale University and\n                    the National University of Singapore, which he described as a\n                    “multi-million or multi-billion” dollar project that was a\n                    “real leap” for Singapore. Needless to say I give no weight at all\n                    to this argument. Indeed, I found this argument deeply ironic, given that barely\n                    a few weeks ago Mr Ravi was defending as fair criticism\n                    Mr Shadrake’s criticism that Andrew Veale was given a light sentence\n                    because he was “the sort of people Singapore needs”. 40     In his earlier submissions Mr Ravi had\n                    sought to place reliance on s 225C of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008\n                    Rev Ed), which provides as follows: Offences against laws of Singapore where no special\n                            punishment is provided 225C. Whoever does anything which by any law\n                        in force in Singapore he is prohibited from doing, or omits to do anything\n                        which he is so enjoined to do, shall, when no special punishment is provided\n                        by the law for such commission or omission, be punished with fine not\n                        exceeding $2,000. 41     When I reminded him of this submission during\n                    the hearing on sentence, Mr Ravi clarified that he was abandoning this\n                    argument, because it is beyond dispute that the common law recognises\n                    imprisonment as a punishment for contempt. This was also Ms Subramanian’s\n                    intended reply, and had the argument been pressed I too would have taken the\n                    same view.",
        "Conclusion on sentence": "42     On the basis of Mr Shadrake’s\n                    culpability alone, in particular his stated intent to repeat his contempt by\n                    publishing an expanded second edition of the book, I would have agreed with Ms\n                    Subramanian’s submission of a minimum sentence of 3 months’\n                    imprisonment to serve the objective of specific deterrence. This would be\n                    further justified by the likely effect of Mr Shadrake’s book on the\n                    uncritical reader, as illustrated by the Guardian article. However, I must take\n                    into account the previous sentencing precedents (which are on the low end), the\n                    fact that the precise extent of the book’s circulation in Singapore was\n                    unclear, and also the fact that Mr Shadrake was not a person with a\n                    credible and established reputation. I would also apply a discount, entirely\n                    undeserved by Mr Shadrake and which will and should not be taken as a\n                    precedent, to signal that the courts have no interest in stifling legitimate\n                    debate on the death penalty and other areas of the law. 43     In the result, I sentence Mr Shadrake to\n                    6 weeks’ imprisonment and a fine of S$20,000, in default of which he shall\n                    serve a further 2 weeks in prison, such further term to run consecutively to the\n                    first. 44     If at any time after my judgment\n                    Mr Shadrake wishes to purge his contempt, he can do so by applying under O\n                    52 r 7(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed).",
        "Costs": "45     After delivering the above judgment on\n                    sentence I heard counsel on costs. It was common ground that I should fix costs.\n                    Ms Subramanian submitted that the Attorney-General should be awarded a total sum\n                    of $80,000 and indicated that a taxed sum would be substantially higher.\n                    Mr Ravi, rather extravagantly, asked for $100,000 in costs for\n                    Mr Shadrake. He argued in the alternative that the Attorney-General should\n                    receive less than $10,000 in costs. 46     As a general rule costs should follow the\n                    event and there is no reason for me to depart from that rule in this case. As\n                    for quantum, the first thing to be noticed is that the submissions on liability\n                    and sentence took three and a half days, on top of several ancillary\n                    matters. 47     I also considered that, although I had adopted\n                    the real risk test in preference to the inherent tendency test, it was not quite\n                    the test Mr Ravi had argued for, which seemed to require a substantial\n                    degree of risk. Ms Subramanian had accepted in the end, as I did, that there\n                    might not be much difference between the inherent tendency test and the real\n                    risk test, although in this regard I would repeat what was said at [50] and [54]\n                    of the main judgment. As for the facts, although I have held that three of the\n                    fourteen impugned statements were not in contempt, very little time was spent on\n                    those three statements, which in any case do not form the sting of his\n                    allegations. The Attorney-General has substantially succeeded on the remaining\n                    eleven statements, on which most of the time was spent. 48     I gave significant weight to the fact that\n                    Mr Shadrake had during the hearing on sentence exhibited a complete lack of\n                    remorse for his contempt, and in particular had stated, through Mr Ravi,\n                    his intention to publish a second and expanded edition of the book. This should\n                    be reflected in my order as to costs. 49     In the result, I fixed costs at\n                    $55,000.  [note: 1]Notes of Evidence, Day 2, p\n                                    140."
