        "Introduction": "1 This is the first case in Singapore in which an investor-State arbitral award on the merits is sought to be set aside. It engages intriguing questions of arbitral and international investment law which have yet to be considered by a Singapore court. 2 The Kingdom of Lesotho (“the Kingdom”) is a member of the Southern African Development Community (“the SADC”), an inter-governmental socio-economic organisation comprising 15 Southern African States. The SADC was established by the Treaty of the Southern African Development Community (17 August 1992) 32 ILM 116 (entered into force 30 September 1993) (“the SADC Treaty”) on 17 August 1992. The SADC Treaty also established a tribunal (“the SADC Tribunal”) to ensure adherence to and to interpret the Treaty, with the jurisdiction to adjudicate disputes and issue advisory opinions. One of the SADC’s objectives is to promote the economic growth of the region, to which end the SADC signed a Protocol on Finance and Investment (“the Investment Protocol”) on 18 August 2006 (entered into force 16 April 2010). Importantly, amongst the various protections that the Investment Protocol conferred on investors was the option of referring certain investor-State disputes to international arbitration, under Annex 1 to the Investment Protocol (“Annex 1”). Various fora were provided therein, one of which was the SADC Tribunal. This complemented the existing procedural protection of referring disputes to the SADC Tribunal under the provisions of the SADC Treaty. 3 The defendants in this application claimed that their investments, namely leases to mine certain territories in the Kingdom, were unlawfully expropriated by the Kingdom between 1991 and 1995. Having unsuccessfully pursued actions in the Kingdom’s domestic courts, the defendants commenced proceedings in the SADC Tribunal in 2009, alleging that the Kingdom had breached its obligations under the SADC Treaty by wrongfully expropriating the mining leases. Unfortunately for the defendants, the SADC Tribunal was dissolved by resolution of the SADC Summit before it had an opportunity to determine the defendants’ claim. Undeterred, the defendants then commenced international arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom in 2012 pursuant to Annex 1, on the basis that the Kingdom, by contributing to or facilitating the shutting down (or “shuttering”, the term adopted in the arbitration and by the parties) of the SADC Tribunal without providing alternative means by which the defendants’ expropriation claim might be heard, again breached its obligations under the SADC Treaty. This arbitration was administered by anad hoctribunal constituted under the auspices of the Permanent Court of Arbitration (“the PCA Tribunal” and “the PCA” respectively), and the PCA Tribunal elected Singapore as the seat of arbitration. The PCA Tribunal rendered two awards in the defendants’ favour: a partial final award on jurisdiction and merits on 18 April 2016 (“the Award”) and a final award on costs on 20 October 2016 (“the Costs Award”). The Award determined that the Kingdom had breached various obligations under the SADC Treaty and granted relief by directing the parties to constitute a new tribunal to hear the defendants’ expropriation claim. It also determined that the Kingdom was liable to pay the defendants’ costs in the arbitration, for which the quantum was subsequently fixed by the Costs Award. 4 By Originating Summons No 492 of 2016 (“OS 492”), the Kingdom applies for the court to set aside the Award in its entirety, on the basis that the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdiction and/or that the Award exceeded the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration. In the alternative, it applies for that part of the Award concerning the Kingdom’s liability to pay the defendants’ costs of the arbitration to be set aside for breach of the rules of natural justice, and/or for the Kingdom having been unable to present its case, and/or on the basis that that part of the Award exceeded the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration. 5 Having carefully reviewed the Award, the parties’ submissions and other relevant material, I have come to the view that the PCA Tribunal did not have jurisdiction over the parties’ dispute and I set aside the Award in entirety. In the premises, I do not need to address the Kingdom’s alternative argument that the portion of the Award dealing with the Kingdom’s liability to pay the defendants’ costs of the arbitration should be set aside for,inter alia, breach of the rules of natural justice. It follows, as a matter of logic, that the Costs Award must also fall away because it was made pursuant to the determination in the Award that the Kingdom was liable to pay the defendants’ costs of the arbitration and reasonable legal costs (Award at [11.1(g)] and Costs Award at [1.2]–[1.4]). The Costs Award is therefore without basis. However, there are two residual but important issues: (a) the court’s jurisdiction to make an order as to the costs of the arbitral proceedings; and (b) the appropriate costs order I should make as regards those proceedings. I consider these issues towards the end of this judgment. 6 As this is a judgment of some length, I set out a brief roadmap of its contents: HeadingPincitesBackground to the dispute[7]–[52]Parties’ cases[53]–[55]Preliminary objection: jurisdiction of this court[56]–[87]Applicable law and principles of treaty interpretation[88]–[104]Objections to the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdiction1) No jurisdictionratione temporis[105]–[180]2) The defendants had no “investment”[181]–[228]3) The defendants’ investment was not “admitted”[229]–[252]4) The dispute did not concern an “obligation in relation to” an admitted investment[253]–[277]5) The defendants did not exhaust local remedies[278]–[319]6) The defendants were not “investors”[320]–[339]Conclusion on setting aside[340]–[343]Costs of the arbitral proceedings[344]–[348]",
        "Background to the dispute": "",
        "The defendants": "7 The first defendant, Swissbourgh Diamond Mines (Pty) Limited (“Swissbourgh”), is a company registered under the laws of the Kingdom and was incorporated by the second defendant, Mr Josias Van Zyl (“Mr Van Zyl”), a national of the Republic of South Africa (“South Africa”), on 12 November 1986. The third and fourth defendants are the representatives of the Burmilla Trust and the Josias Van Zyl Family Trust (“the JVZF Trust”) respectively. Both trusts were established under the laws of South Africa. 8 When Swissbourgh was first incorporated, 5% of its shares were held by Mr Van Zyl, 85% were held by a nominee of Mr Van Zyl and the remaining 10% were halved between two other persons. In March 1989, all the shareholders other than Mr Van Zyl divested their shareholding to the JVZF Trust, which thus acquired 95% of the shares in Swissbourgh. In June 1997, the JVZF Trust transferred 90% of the shares in Swissbourgh to the Burmilla Trust. The ownership of Swissbourgh has remained unchanged to date and is divided between Mr Van Zyl (5%), the JVZF Trust (5%) and the Burmilla Trust (90%).",
        "The Mining Leases and the Tributing Agreements": "9 By 1987, Swissbourgh had submitted applications first for prospecting leases and then for five mining leases in five regions of the Kingdom, namely the Matsoku, Motete, Rampai, Orange, and Patiseng/Khubelu regions (“the Mining Leases”). 10 In brief, the review of such applications involved the following stages. First, negotiations between the applicant and a committee of senior government officials who would advise the Ministry for Water, Energy and Mining. Secondly, approval by the Ministry for Water, Energy and Mining. Thirdly, approval by the Kingdom’s Mining Board. Fourthly, recommendation by the Kingdom’s Mining Board to the Kingdom’s Military Council following consultations with the local chiefs responsible for the land which was the subject of the applications. Fifthly, approval by the Kingdom’s Military Council. Finally, approval by the King of Lesotho. 11 In June 1988, at the conclusion of the above-mentioned process, the King of Lesotho granted Swissbourgh’s applications for the Mining Leases. On 26 October 1988, the Kingdom’s Registrar of Deeds in Maseru registered the Mining Leases. However, the Kingdom subsequently claimed to discover, after the Mining Leases had been registered, that there was no evidence that the local chiefs in the Rampai area had been consulted or had agreed to the grant of a lease. This sparked the issues between the parties. 12 The fifth to ninth defendants – Matsoku Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Motete Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Orange Diamonds (Pty) Limited, Patiseng Diamonds (Pty) Limited and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited (collectively “the Tributees”) – were incorporated in 1988 under the laws of the Kingdom, apparently by Swissbourgh and/or Mr Van Zyl, and named after the regions in which they were to carry out diamond mining operations. Between 15 December 1989 and 10 January 1990, the Tributees sub-leased the Mining Leases from Swissbourgh under agreements which I refer to hereinafter as “the Tributing Agreements”. Under the Tributing Agreements, the Tributees would hold and exercise the mining rights under the relevant Mining Leases. The Tributing Agreements were registered at the Maseru Deeds Registry during the same period. 13 In September 1994, ownership of the Tributees was transferred to the Burmilla Trust (which acquired 99% of the shares) and the JVZF Trust (which acquired the remaining 1%). 14 On 16 September 1994, Swissbourgh and the Tributees signed an “Agreement of Sale and Cession of Claims”, by which they agreed to assign to the Burmilla Trust their rights relating to any claims against the Kingdom due to its purported interference with the Mining Leases. From 1994 to 1997, Swissbourgh and the Tributees assigned their claims against the Kingdom to the Burmilla Trust.",
        "The alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases and court proceedings": "15 The alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases has a convoluted history. The five mining areas were of interest not only to the defendants but also to the Kingdom. In 1986, shortly before Swissbourgh applied for the Mining Leases, the Kingdom and South Africa had entered into a large-scale commercial joint venture – the Lesotho Highlands Water Project (“LHWP”). The objective of the LHWP was to control the flow of the Orange-Senqu River, which rises in the Kingdom and flows through South Africa and Botswana into Namibia, and to divert water from the river to South Africa. The Kingdom benefitted from the LHWP by receiving a royalty for water transferred under the LHWP, which accounted for a considerable part of the Kingdom’s annual budget, and by deriving electricity from its hydropower stations, which satisfied a significant portion of the Kingdom’s energy needs. 16 The Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (“LHDA”) was created in 1986 to implement, operate and maintain the LHWP. By 1989, the LHDA had commenced construction works in the Rampai area, which was the subject of one of the Mining Leases. 17 In April 1991, General Justin Lekhanya, the then Chairman of the Military Council, the governing body of the Kingdom at the time, was ousted. Colonel Elias P Ramaema became the country’s new leader. 18 July 1991 saw the defendants’ dispute with the Kingdom spark into life. On 18 July 1991, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited,ie, the first and ninth defendants, obtained anex parteinterim injunction from the High Court of Lesotho ordering that the LHDA be “interdicted … from performing any works and/or from destroying, using up, disturbing, mixing up and/or covering up any gravel deposits or other minerals” in the Rampai lease area. On 25 July 1991, the LHDA filed a counter-application to have the interim injunction set aside. On 29 July 1991, the parties agreed that the order be set aside but no settlement agreement was executed. 19 Between end July or early August and end August 1991, the Kingdom’s Commissioner of Mines issued written notices to Swissbourgh alleging that it had breached its obligations under all five Mining Leases. The notices threatened to cancel the Mining Leases if the breaches were not remedied within 60 days. Between 10 October and 4 November 1991, the Commissioner of Mines purported to cancel all five Mining Leases, although it subsequently became apparent that he was not entitled to do so because the Mining Leases provided for the resolution of such disputes by arbitration. The Commissioner of Mines ordered the defendants to remove their property from the lease areas within 90 days, and instructed local police to prevent the defendants from continuing operations and to oversee the removal of their property from the lease areas. 20 On 28 October 1991, Swissbourgh requested that the dispute over the purported cancellation of its Mining Leases by the Commissioner of Mines be referred toad hocarbitration. 21 On 18 November 1991, the Kingdom granted the LHDA a lease over parts of the territory subject to the Mining Leases for the purposes of water storage and electricity generation. 22 On 19 November 1991, Swissbourgh and the Tributees instituted judicial review proceedings in the High Court of Lesotho against the Commissioner of Mines (“the 1991 JR Proceedings”) for annulment of the purported cancellations of the Mining Leases and interim relief pending the outcome of the arbitral proceedings. The High Court granted the application for interim relief the next day and permitted the Tributees to continue mining in the Matsoku and Patiseng lease areas. The parties subsequently agreed to stay the arbitral proceedings pending the outcome of the 1991 JR Proceedings. 23 On 20 March 1992, the Kingdom’s Military Council passed the Revocation of Specific Mining Leases Order of 1992 (“the 1992 Revocation Order”), which revoked the Mining Leases as well as the Tributing Agreements, discharged all the defendants’ pending claims before domestic courts and arbitral tribunals, required the defendants to vacate the lease areas and excluded any right to compensation as well as any right for the defendants to seek judicial or arbitral redress. On 7 April 1992, Swissbourgh and the Tributees commenced proceedings in the High Court of Lesotho, seeking the annulment of the 1992 Revocation Order and an interim injunction restraining the LHDA from interfering with the defendants’ rights under the Mining Leases. Pending these proceedings, the defendants were unable to enter the lease areas or exercise their mining rights. On 27 September 1994, the Chief Justice of the High Court of Lesotho declared the 1992 Revocation Order null and void. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho affirmed this decision in January 1995. 24 While the legal challenge to the 1992 Revocation Order was underway, the defendants terminated all of the Mining Leases (save for the Rampai lease) on 11 March 1993 on the basis that the Kingdom had breached and repudiated them. 25 On 2 March 1995, the LHDA filed a counter-application in the 1991 JR Proceedings, seeking a declaration that the Rampai lease was voidab initiodue to the Kingdom’s purported failure to consult the relevant chiefs before approving the Mining Leases (“the Rampai Lease Proceedings”). On 27 March 1995, Swissbourgh and the Tributees obtained an order from the High Court recording their agreement with the Commissioner of Mines to set aside his purported cancellation of the Mining Leases in 1991. 26 On 16 and 17 August 1995, the Kingdom enacted two pieces of legislation, the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (Amendment) Act (No 5 of 1995) and the Lesotho Highlands Development Authority (Validation of Activities in respect of Phase 1A and Phase 1B Scheme) Act (No 6 of 1995) (“the LHDA Acts”). The LHDA Acts enabled the Kingdom to expropriate any area that fell within the LHWP, subject to compensating the holders of valid mining leases in the affected areas. Pursuant to the LHDA Acts, areas in Rampai subject to the Rampai lease were expropriated by October 1995. In July 1996, the defendants filed a claim for compensation in respect of the Rampai lease but the LHDA refused to consider the claim until the Rampai Lease Proceedings were concluded. The argument of the LHDA was that until the validity of the Rampai Lease was decided, it would be premature to consider the issue of compensation. 27 In May 1996, Swissbourgh and the Tributees commenced proceedings against the Kingdom in the Lesotho High Court to recover damages in respect of four of the Mining Leases (“the 1996 Proceedings”). The proceedings did not involve the Rampai lease as its validity was the subject of the Rampai Lease Proceedings. Swissbourgh and the Tributees claimed that the Kingdom had unlawfully and intentionally deprived Swissbourgh of its rights under the four Mining Leases by purporting to cancel or revoke the leases and by hindering Swissbourgh from exercising its mining rights. 28 In September 1998, Swissbourgh and Rampai Diamonds (Pty) Limited,ie, the first and ninth defendants, commenced proceedings against the LHDA in the Lesotho High Court, seeking damages for the expropriation of the Rampai lease (“the 1998 Proceedings”). 29 On 28 April 1999, the Lesotho High Court granted the LHDA’s application in the Rampai Lease Proceedings and decided that the Rampai lease was voidab initio. The Court of Appeal of Lesotho dismissed the defendants’ appeal on 6 October 2000. Since the Rampai lease had been found to be void, the defendants were not eligible for compensation in respect of that lease under the LHDA Acts. The defendants did not pursue the 1998 Proceedings further as a result. The defendants also did not pursue the 1996 Proceedings, because they suspected that the other Mining Leases suffered from the same defect as the Rampai lease and were likewise void. 30 Between 2000 and 2007, the defendants requested the Government of South Africa to exercise diplomatic protection with regard to their investments in the Kingdom. The Government of South Africa denied their request. Attempts to review the Government’s decision were unsuccessful in the High Court of South Africa and the Supreme Court of Appeal of South Africa. The defendants then commenced proceedings against the Kingdom before the SADC Tribunal for expropriation of the Mining Leases.",
        "Proceedings in the SADC Tribunal": "31 Some background to the SADC and its organs is necessary: (a) As stated earlier, the SADC Treaty was signed on 17 August 1992 and entered into force on 30 September 1993. The SADC’s supreme policy-making body is the Summit of Heads of State or Government (“the SADC Summit”), comprising the heads of State of all SADC Member States. Article 9(1)(g) of the SADC Treaty established the SADC Tribunal, although no judges were appointed to the SADC Tribunal until 2005. (b) On 7 August 2000, the Protocol on Tribunal in the Southern African Development Community (“the Tribunal Protocol”) was signed. The Tribunal Protocol clarified the operation of the SADC Tribunal, including its composition, powers, functions, jurisdictions and procedures. It entered into force on 14 August 2001. (c) As noted earlier, the Investment Protocol (see [2] above), along with 11 Annexes, was signed on 18 August 2006 and entered into force on 16 April 2010. 32 On 12 June 2009, having failed to obtain diplomatic protection from South Africa, the defendants commenced proceedings in the SADC Tribunal. They sought damages for the Kingdom’s purported violations of Arts 4(c) and 6 of the SADC Treaty by its measures in respect of the Mining Leases. It should be noted that this was a claim brought under the SADC Treaty and the Tribunal Protocol, and not under Annex 1 of the Investment Protocol, which only came into force on 16 April 2010. I shall refer to the defendants’ claim before the SADC Tribunal as “the SADC claim”. 33 However, the SADC Tribunal was eventually unable to determine the SADC claim. From 2007 to 2009, the SADC Tribunal made a series of decisions in a separate dispute between the Republic of Zimbabwe and one of its investors (“theCampbell v Zimbabwecase”) which were not received favourably by Zimbabwe. In 2010, at Zimbabwe’s bidding, the SADC Summit (including the Kingdom) unanimously adopted the resolution that the terms of office of five SADC Tribunal judges, which were to expire in October 2010, would not be renewed, pending a review of the SADC Tribunal’s role and responsibilities. The SADC Summit also decided that the SADC Tribunal would not hear any new cases. The failure to extend the five judges’ terms of office left the SADC Tribunal inoperable, since Art 3(1) of the Tribunal Protocol required that the SADC Tribunal consist of at least 10 judges. This meant that the SADC claim could not proceed. 34 On 25 January 2011, the defendants filed another application with the SADC Tribunal in response to its purported suspension, requesting that the SADC Tribunal continue its operations in respect of the SADC claim. The application was not allowed. 35 In May 2011, the SADC Council of Ministers (comprising the ministers for foreign affairs, economic planning, or finance from each SADC Member State) decided that the suspension of the SADC Tribunal would continue until August 2011 and that no judges would be re-appointed. The SADC Summit endorsed these decisions at an extraordinary meeting held around the same period. 36 By a letter dated 22 August 2011, the defendants sought the Kingdom’s agreement to submit the pending SADC claim to arbitration by the PCA. The Kingdom declined on 5 October 2011. 37 In a significant development, in August 2012, the SADC Summit resolved to dissolve the SADC Tribunal as it then existed entirely, and to negotiate a new protocol limiting the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdiction to inter-State disputes. This prevented the SADC Tribunal from determining the cases pending before it, including the SADC claim. The defendants were therefore left without a forum for the SADC claim. Acknowledging this, the SADC Justice Committee (comprising the Ministers of Justice or Attorneys-General of the SADC Member States) advised the SADC Council of Ministers and the SADC Summit that the dissolution of the SADC Tribunal left a “legal vacuum”. It advised that the parties in existing cases before the SADC Tribunal “may elect to pursue them before other regional or international legal forums as they will be left with no prospect of them being resolved at the SADC regional level”, and recommended that the SADC Council of Ministers and the SADC Summit “give guidance on the way forward”. 38 On 18 August 2014, the SADC Summit unanimously adopted a new Protocol on the SADC Tribunal that restricted the Tribunal’s jurisdiction to inter-State disputes and abolished jurisdiction over cases brought by individuals or legal entities other than States. As a result, the SADC Tribunal was unable to determine the SADC claim. It appears that the new Protocol has not entered into force. 39 According to the Kingdom, on 17–18 August 2015, the SADC Summit approved the proposal that “each Member State may decide on an alternative forum for the resolution of a SADC Tribunal pending case of which that Member State has been named a respondent”. It appears that no steps have been taken by the Kingdom in this regard with respect to the SADC claim.",
        "The PCA Arbitration": "Arbitral proceedings 40 On 20 June 2012, the defendants commenced arbitral proceedings against the Kingdom by a Notice of Arbitration, pursuant to Art 28(1) of Annex 1. Article 28 is of critical importance in OS 492 and states: ARTICLE 28 SETTLEMENT OF INVESTMENT DISPUTES 1. Disputes between an investor and a State Party concerning an obligation of the latter in relation to an admitted investment of the former, which have not been amicably settled, and after exhausting local remedies shall, after a period of six (6) months from written notification of a claim, be submitted to international arbitration if either party to the dispute so wishes. 2. Where the dispute is referred to international arbitration, the investor and the State Party concerned in the dispute may agree to refer the dispute either to: (a)  The SADC Tribunal; (b) The International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes (having regard to the provisions, where applicable, of the ICSID Convention and the Additional Facility for the Administration of Conciliation, Arbitration and Fact-Finding Proceedings); or (c)  An international arbitrator or ad hoc arbitral tribunal to be appointed by a special agreement or established under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law. 3. If after a period of three (3) months from written notification of the claim there is no agreement to one of the above alternative procedures, the parties to the dispute shall be bound to submit the dispute to arbitration under the Arbitration Rules of the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law as then in force. The parties to the dispute may agree in writing to modify these Rules. 4. The provisions of this Article shall not apply to a dispute, which arose before entry into force of this Annex. 41 The third option under Art 28(2) was chosen,ie,ad hocarbitration. The PCA Tribunal comprised three arbitrators: Mr R Doak Bishop, nominated by the defendants (the claimants in the arbitration); Mr Justice Petrus Millar Nienaber, nominated by the Kingdom; and Prof David A R Williams QC as Presiding Arbitrator, chosen by the designated appointing authority. With the benefit of the parties’ submissions, the PCA Tribunal decided on Singapore as both the place of arbitration and the hearing venue. The arbitral proceedings were bifurcated into two phases. The first phase was to deal with all issues of jurisdiction and liability, including all jurisdictional objections. Subject to the findings in the first phase, a second phase would be dedicated to all issues of remedies. The first phase was heard in Singapore from 24 to 27 August 2015. No second phase was ultimately convened. 42 The defendants’ case in the arbitration was that by participating in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal without providing an alternative means for the SADC claim to be determined, the Kingdom had breached its obligations under Arts 14 and/or 15 of the Tribunal Protocol; Arts 6(1) and 27 of Annex 1; and Art 6(1) read with Art 4(c) of the SADC Treaty. The defendants requested the PCA Tribunal to “step into the shoes” of the SADC Tribunal and award the defendants “such relief and compensation … as could have been granted by the SADC Tribunal” for the expropriation of the Mining Leases, as well as all costs incurred in connection with the arbitration. 43 The Kingdom disputed the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdiction on seven main grounds: (a) The Kingdom submitted that the true dispute was the alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases from 1991 to 1995 (“the expropriation dispute”). It said that the PCA Tribunal had no jurisdiction since Art 28(4) of Annex 1 confined its jurisdiction to disputes arisingafterthe Investment Protocol’s entry into force on 16 April 2010. The defendants counter-argued that the dispute in this case was not the expropriation dispute, but rather the termination without recourse of the pending SADC claim as a result of the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal (“the shuttering dispute”), which occurred after the entry into force of the Investment Protocol (ie,the shuttering dispute was within the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdictionratione temporis). (b) According to the Kingdom, it followed from the principle of non-retroactivity of international treaties that Annex 1 did not apply to investments pre-dating the entry into force of the Investment Protocol in April 2010. The Kingdom pointed out that Swissbourgh had acquired the Mining Leases, and the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust had acquired their shareholding in Swissbourgh, before that date. The defendants denied that the date of the investment was relevant to jurisdiction since Annex 1 specifically referred also to “existing investments”. (c) The Kingdom contended that Swissbourgh and the Tributees, being incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom, could not qualify as “investors” for the purpose of Annex 1. The Kingdom submitted that “investors” had to be foreign entities or individuals to qualify for investment treaty protection. Moreover, the Burmilla Trust (to which their rights had been assigned) and the JVZF Trust lacked legal capacity to bring legal proceedings under South African law, which required that thetrustees(rather than the trust itself) be named as claimant. The defendants counter-argued that Annex 1 did not distinguish between domestic and foreign investors, that the definition of “investor” in Annex 1 included trusts, and that it did not matter whether the trusts or their trustees were named in the arbitration. (d) The Kingdom submitted that the right to claim in an international forum such as the SADC Tribunal could not constitute an “investment” for the purposes of Annex 1, both as a principle of general international investment law and in light of the precise wording of the Investment Protocol. The defendants contended that the secondary right to remedies before an international tribunal could constitute an investment, being part of a bundle of rights along with the primary right to have the Mining Leases performed. (e) The Kingdom submitted that the defendants did not have an “admitted” investment for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 as neither the Mining Leases nor any litigious claims emanating from them had been subject to a proper admission procedure. The defendants asserted that the Kingdom had “admitted” their investment by granting the Mining Leases pursuant to its internal procedure and by endorsing the validity of these leases for several years. (f) The Kingdom denied that it bore any relevant “obligation … in relation to” either the Mining Leases or the defendants’ right to claim in the SADC Tribunal within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. The defendants interpreted Art 28(1) of Annex 1 differently, contending that it was thedisputerather than theobligationthat had to relate to the admitted investment. (g) The Kingdom asserted that local remedies (ie,remedies in Lesotho) had not been exhausted, relying on Art 28(1) of Annex 1 to the Investment Protocol and general principles of international law. The true dispute was the expropriation dispute, in respect of which local remedies remained unexhausted. Alternatively, as regards the shuttering dispute, the defendants could have pursued a local remedy described as an “Aquilian action”,ie, seeking compensation for economic loss caused by the Kingdom’s participation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal, but did not do so. The defendants denied that any local remedy was available. 44 As to the merits of the defendants’ claim, the Kingdom denied that it had breached any obligations, asserting that the SADC Member States had acted within their sovereign powers in suspending the SADC Tribunal. The Kingdom disputed that the defendants had been denied justice, as both domestic and international legal remedies remained available to them. Generally, the Kingdom denied any responsibility for decisions made by the SADC Summit, since these could only result in the liability of the SADC as an international organisation, and not in the liability of any of its individual Member States. The Award 45 At the conclusion of the first phase, the PCA Tribunal (Justice Nienaber dissenting) found in favour of the defendants and ruled as follows: (a) The PCA Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims of the second, third and fourth defendants only. While Art 28 of Annex 1 was broad enough to cover domestic investors, Swissbourgh and the Tributees had assigned their claims to the Burmilla Trust, which was the proper party. Swissbourgh and the Tributees’ claims were therefore dismissed. (b) The Kingdom’s other jurisdictional objections were dismissed. In particular, the PCA Tribunal found that the true dispute was the shuttering dispute, which had arisen after the entry into force of Annex 1. This dispute concerned the obligations of the Kingdom relating to the defendants’ right to refer disputes to the SADC Tribunal, which was an “investment”, being part of a bundle of rights related to the Mining Leases. This investment had been “admitted” via the Kingdom’s acceptance and confirmation of the Mining Leases. There were no local remedies for the defendants to exhaust in respect of the shuttering dispute. (c) The Kingdom had breached Arts 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protocol by unilaterally withdrawing its consent to the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdiction over the SADC claim. (d) The Kingdom had breached Art 6(1) of Annex 1 by failing to accord fair and equitable treatment to the defendants and their investment. (e) The Kingdom had breached Art 27 of Annex 1 by failing to protect the defendants’ right of access to the SADC Tribunal, which was a judicial tribunal or other authority competent under the laws of the Kingdom. (f) The Kingdom had breached Arts 4(c) and 6(1) of the SADC Treaty by failing to uphold the rule of law. 46 By way of relief, the PCA Tribunal found that the parties should establish a new tribunal to hear and determine the SADC claim. The new tribunal was to be seated in Mauritius (unless the parties agreed on another seat) and comprise three independent and impartial arbitrators who were nationals of SADC Member States. The new tribunal would have the same jurisdiction which the SADC Tribunal had in 2009 when the defendants first filed the SADC claim. The arbitration would be administered by the PCA (unless the parties agreed otherwise) under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010, save that the tribunal should take into account the SADC Tribunal Protocol and Rules where practicable, including in relation to jurisdiction. The parties were required to confirm in writing to the PCA Tribunal, within 30 days of the issuance of the Award, that they agreed to submit, and thereby consented, to arbitration before the new tribunal of the expropriation dispute. 47 Justice Nienaber authored a strong dissenting opinion (“the Dissenting Opinion”). He disagreed that the PCA Tribunal had jurisdiction. He thought that the dispute was properly characterised as the expropriation dispute, which pre-dated the entry into force of the Investment Protocol, rather than the shuttering dispute. The PCA Tribunal thus lacked jurisdictionratione temporis. He also took the view that the defendants had not exhausted local remedies (in particular, the remedy of an Aquilian action as regards the shuttering dispute) prior to commencing the arbitration. 48 The PCA Tribunal issued the Costs Award on 20 October 2016. It found that the defendants were entitled to be reimbursed by the Kingdom for the costs of the arbitral proceedings, which it quantified as US$2,137,061.28, €265,703.04, £10,350.49 and ZAR775,517.71, subject to the Kingdom’s entitlement to offset the costs by ZAR1,826,299.07 plus interest for its costs in the litigation in the Kingdom’s domestic courts. The Costs Award was the subject of separate proceedings for enforcement in Singapore: seeJosias Van Zyl and others v Kingdom of Lesotho[2017] SGHC 104. 49 I will examine the reasoning of the majority of the PCA Tribunal as well as of Justice Nienaber in greater detail in my analysis below of each of the Kingdom’s jurisdictional objections. Interpretation of the Award 50 On 13 May 2016, the Kingdom sought an interpretation of the Award under Art 37 of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010. In light of the PCA Tribunal’s finding that it had jurisdiction to hear and determine the claims of the second to fourth defendants only, the Kingdom sought confirmation that the obligation to establish the new tribunal applied to the second to fourth defendants only, and that only the second to fourth defendants’ claims were to be submitted to arbitration by the new tribunal. 51 On 18 May 2016, a day after filing OS 492, the Kingdom confirmed by letter to the PCA Tribunal that it would submit to the jurisdiction of the new tribunal, subject to the outcome of its request for interpretation. 52 On 27 June 2016, the PCA Tribunal issued an Interpretation of the Partial Final Award on Jurisdiction and Merits (“the Interpretation”). It gave the following clarifications: (a) Only the second to fourth defendants, and the Kingdom, were ordered to establish the new tribunal under the Award (at [7.7] of the Interpretation). The PCA Tribunal only had jurisdiction to order the second to fourth defendants to participate in the arbitration before the new tribunal (at [7.8]). (b) Nevertheless, the new tribunal, being invested with the jurisdiction of the SADC Tribunal prior to its being shuttered, had jurisdiction to accept claims from all nine defendants (at [7.12]). Accordingly, Swissbourgh and the Tributees could voluntarily apply to participate in the new arbitration should they consider it necessary or desirable to do so (at [7.8]). (c) Unless the second to fourth defendants and the Kingdom agreed otherwise, the proper procedure for Swissbourgh and the Tributees to be involved in the new arbitration would be for them to apply to the tribunal to be joined under Art 17(5) of the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 2010. It would be for the new tribunal to decide whether to permit such joinder (at [7.9]–[7.10]). The PCA Tribunal made no finding as to the proper parties to pursue the SADC claim, and this was a matter for the new tribunal to determine (at [7.12]).",
        "Parties’ cases": "53 In OS 492, the Kingdom seeks the following orders: (a) that the entire Award be set aside or reversed pursuant to: (i) s 10(3) of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“the IAA”) –ie, an appeal against the PCA Tribunal’s ruling on jurisdiction; or, in the alternative, (ii) s 3(1) of the IAA read with Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration (“the Model Law”) –ie, on the basis that the Award exceeded the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration, or, in the further alternative, (b) that that part of the Award finding the Kingdom liable to pay the defendants’ costs of the arbitration be set aside or reversed pursuant to: (i) s 24(b) of the IAA –ie, a breach of the rules of natural justice; and/or (ii) s 3(1) of the IAA read with Art 34(2)(a)(ii) and/or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law –ie,that the Kingdom was unable to present its case on costs and/or that the finding of liability for costs exceeded the terms or scope of the submission to arbitration; (c) that the costs of both OS 492 and the arbitration proceedings before the PCA Tribunal be awarded in the Kingdom’s favour; and (d) such other relief as the court might think fit. 54 To justify setting aside the Award in entirety, the Kingdom essentially reiterated the jurisdictional objections that it had raised before the PCA Tribunal (see [43] above). As regards its liability to pay costs, the Kingdom submitted as follows: (a) The Kingdom had not been given an opportunity to make submissions on the question of costs before the PCA Tribunal rendered its decision, thus offending s 24(b) of the IAA and Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law. (b) By ruling on an issue without having given the parties a reasonable opportunity to present their cases on it, the PCA Tribunal rendered a decision beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration, thus offending Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. 55 The defendants raised a preliminary objection to OS 492, submitting that this court lacked jurisdiction to set aside the Award under either s 10(3) of the IAA or Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. Section 10(3) of the IAA had no application to arbitral awards containing decisions on both jurisdiction and merits, while Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law only addressed situations where the tribunalexceededjurisdiction, rather than situations where it lackedjurisdiction to begin with. The defendants strove to justify the PCA Tribunal’s findings on both its jurisdiction and the merits.",
        "Preliminary objection: jurisdiction of this court": "",
        "Parties’ submissions": "326 The Kingdom disagreed with the PCA Tribunal’s finding that Swissbourgh and the Tributees were capable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1), as they were incorporated under the laws of the Kingdom. The PCA Tribunal had erred by overemphasising the express wording of Annex 1 at the expense of the context of Art 28(1) and the object and purpose of the Investment Protocol. The Kingdom described the PCA Tribunal’s finding that Annex 1 applied to domestic investors as “unprecedented” and a “departure from well-established principles of international law”. Other multilateral treaties like the NAFTA, the Central American Free Trade Agreement (2004) 43 ILM 514 (“the CAFTA”) and the Energy Charter Treaty (17 December 1994) 2080 UNTS 95 (entered into force 16 April 1998) (“the ECT”) applied only to foreign investors. In this regard, the Kingdom citedBayview Irrigation District et alv UnitedMexican States, ICSID Case No ARB(AF)/05/1, Award, 19 June 2007. In rejecting a claim by US nationals who had made an investment in the US but alleged that this investment was being adversely affected by measures taken by Mexico, the tribunal stated at [95]–[96]: 95. If, however, the NAFTA were intended to have such a significant effect one would expect to find very clear indications of it in thetravauxpréparatoires. There are no such clear indications, in thetravauxpréparatoiresor elsewhere ... 96. While NAFTA Article 1139 defines the term “investment” it does not define “foreign investment”. Similarly, NAFTA Chapter XI is named “Investment”, not “Foreign Investment”. However, this Tribunal considers that NAFTA Chapter XI in fact refers to “foreign investment” and that it regulates “foreign investors” and “investments of foreign investors of another Party”. The ordinary meaning of the text of the relevant provisions of Chapter Eleven is that they are concerned withforeigninvestment, not domestic investments. … 327 The Kingdom also identified various features of Annex 1 which revealed that its scope related toforeigninvestors andforeigninvestment. I include these where relevant at [331] below. 328 The Kingdom also submitted that the effect of extending Annex 1 to domestic investors would be to introduce “an additional tier to the judicial system of each SADC State”, which would be “extraordinary and entirely inconsistent with the scope of protection in both bilateral and multilateral investment treaties”. If that had been the Member States’ intention, they would surely have incorporated express words to that effect. 329 Finally, the Kingdom criticised the PCA Tribunal’s reliance onMike Campbell(see [325] above), which had been decided in the materially different context of Art 15 of the Tribunal Protocol. This could not be compared to Art 28 of Annex 1.MikeCampbellconcerned a claim brought by a Zimbabwean national against Zimbabwe for breach of the obligation to respect human rights under Art 4 of the SADC Treaty. The Kingdom pointed out that human rights obligations apply to nationals and aliens without distinction. By contrast, in the Kingdom’s words, the “appropriate starting point [in an investment treaty] is that there is an important distinction (as a matter of general international law) between the status and treatment of nationals and aliens”.",
        "My analysis": "330 I agree that the definitions of “investor”, “person” and “company” in Art 1 of Annex 1 do not expressly exclude Lesotho nationals or companies from being investors. However, the meaning to be attributed to the term “investors” is to be ascertained with reference to the ordinary meaning of that terminits context and in the light of the object and purpose of Annex 1(and more broadly the Investment Protocol and the SADC Treaty) (cf[95] above). Obviously, having thetravauxpréparatoiresbefore me would have been of significant assistance in this regard. In my view, the context of Annex 1’s discussion of investment, together with the object and purpose of Annex 1, the Investment Protocol and the SADC Treaty, strongly indicate that Annex 1 is intended to attract and protectforeigninvestors within each host State. 331 The obvious purpose of the Investment Protocol is to incentivise investment by providing various protections to investors; the SADC Member States would hardly need to resort to a regional multilateral treaty to incentivise investments by their own nationals. In this regard, Annex 1 bears numerous indications of its orientation towards foreign investments, including the following. (a) The Preamble to Annex 1 generally reflects a concern that the SADC regionas a wholedoes not receive sufficient investment. The Preamble notes “the low levels of investment into the SADC”, recommends greater regional cooperation to “enhance the attractiveness of the Region as [an] investment destination”, notes that “without effective policies on investment protection and promotion, the Region will continue to be marginalised in terms of investment inflows”, and expresses a desire to be guided by the Investment Protocol “in the facilitation and stimulation of investment flows … into the Region”. These phrases show that the purpose of Annex 1 is not to incentivise nationals to investin their ownStatesbut to make the regionas a wholemore desirable to external investors. (b) This is reinforced by Arts 19 and 23 of Annex 1. Article 19 requires Member States to “pursue harmonisation with the objective of developing the region into a SADC investment zone”. Article 23 creates certain obligations on Member Statesvis-à-vistheir Investment Promotion Agencies, defined in Art 1 as agencies which,inter alia,“develop a favourable investment image of their countries”, “make recommendations for improvements of their countries as investment destinations” and “keep track of all investors entering and leaving the country…”. These articles thus give effect to the Preamble’s focus on attracting external investors to each SADC Member State. (c) Article 3 of Annex 1 obliges Member States to support the development of local and regional entrepreneurs, but allows Member States to “place emphasis on industries that … have a favourable effect on attracting foreign direct investment”: see Art 3(2) of Annex 1. (d) Article 9 of Annex 1 provides that each Member State shall “ensure that investors are allowed facilities in relation to repatriation of investments and returns in accordance with the rules and regulations stipulated by the Host State”. This is a protection that can only apply to foreign investors. (e) Article 28(1) of Annex 1 provides for the settlement of investment disputes by “international arbitration” (by either the SADC Tribunal, ICSID or an international arbitrator orad hocarbitral tribunal, as specified in Art 28(2)). Notably, claims by nationals of the host State are expressly excluded from the scope of the ICSID Convention by Art 25(1) thereof. The fact that onlyinternationalarbitration is provided for, and that ICSID is one of the options, suggests that the types of disputes which Art 28(1) envisages are those which arise between the host State and a foreign investor. 332 This analysis is supported by the requirement of exhaustion of local remedies in Art 28(1) of Annex 1. As I have observed at [293] above, the requirement serves to protect State sovereignty. Without such a requirement, foreign nationals would be free to leapfrog the domestic legal system and take their complaints directly to international entities. The requirement of exhausting local remedies is thus included in Art 28(1) to protect Member States from being held internationally responsible by foreign investors without having an opportunity to remedy the wrong internally. It reinforces the Investment Protocol’s focus on foreign investment. 333 The fact that Annex 1 does notexpresslyconfine its terms to foreign investors is not so compelling as to outweigh the clear context, object and purpose of Annex 1. On the contrary, it is difficult to believe that if SADC Member States did intend to confer treaty protections on domestic investors, which would trigger broad-ranging and significant legal consequences (not least thede factocreation of a new tier to the judicial system for domestic investors), they would have neglected to provide for and regulate these consequences expressly. That is far less plausible than the alternative,ie,the SADC Member States did not intend to trigger such consequences although they did not expressly say so. The definition of “investment” in Annex 1 is one which, if applied to nationals, would invariably include every national who had ever purchased property, acquired company shares or acquired licences to exploit natural resources (amongst others). Extending treaty protections to nationals would constitute a significant intrusion into the sovereignty and freedoms of each Member State. Indeed, it seems quite extraordinary to conclude as such in the absence of clear and explicit language. Construing Annex 1 in such a way contradicts the principle that treaties must be interpreted with due recognition to the interests of the negotiating States and their sovereignty (see [100]–[101] above). 334 In addition, various concepts in Art 28(1) do not easily lend themselves, without modification, to domestic investments. For example, the concept of “admission” is one which relates to the host State granting permission to a foreign investor to invest in the territory of the host State provided it complies with the host State’s laws and regulations. In the case of a domestic investor, it is not clear what the process of “admission” would entail: the only relevant laws and regulations would be domestic laws, for example those pertaining to the purchase of property, acquisition of shares and so on. 335 I disagree with the PCA Tribunal’s view thatMikeCampbellis “persuasive authority” for the proposition that a domestic entity may sue its own government under the Investment Protocol (Award at [7.69]). As the Kingdom pointed out, the respective contexts of the two cases are incomparable.Mike Campbellrecognised that a national may sue his own State in the SADC Tribunal for breach ofhuman rights, which is a breach of Art 4(c) of the SADC Treaty. This recognition must be read in light of (a) the objectives of the SADC Treaty and (b) the jurisdictional conditions of the SADC Tribunal: (a) The objectives of the SADC Treaty are not confined to the promotion of investments. They include, for example, the alleviation of poverty; the support of the socially disadvantaged; the promotion of shared values through institutions which are democratic, legitimate and effective; and the maintenance of democracy, peace, security and stability (see Art 5 of the SADC Treaty). These are objectives whose success depends significantly upon the relationship between a host State and its own nationals, and not solely its relationship with foreign nationals. (b) Articles 14 and 15 of the Tribunal Protocol delimit the jurisdiction of the SADC Tribunal. Article 14 specifies broad categories of disputes within the SADC Tribunal’s jurisdiction (eg, the interpretation and application of the Treaty and all protocols). Article 15 of the Tribunal Protocol gives the SADC Tribunal jurisdiction over disputes between natural persons and States. The SADC Tribunal’s jurisdiction is therefore not confined to disputes concerning specific subject-matter or persons suing in a particular capacity. The SADC Tribunal serves as the general adjudicative body of the SADC, and the breadth of its jurisdiction mirrors the SADC’s varied objectives. 336 Article 28(1) of Annex 1, on the other hand, creates a much narrower avenue for submitting a dispute to international arbitration. (a) First, Art 28(1) resides in Annex 1, which has a far more circumscribed purpose than the overarching SADC Treaty. I have already explained that the wording and provisions of Annex 1 suggest that its aim is to attract foreign investment into each Member State, an objective which bears no relation to the relationship between each host State and its own nationals. It clearly cannot be assumed, for the purposes of comparingMike Campbellto the present case, that the international arbitral body referred to in Art 28(2) shares the same purpose and function as the SADC Tribunal, unless of course the SADC Tribunal is selected as the mode of dispute resolution pursuant to Art 28(2)(a). But even then, the SADC Tribunal would have to fulfil this role with regard to the terms of reference of Art 28(1), which is limited to investment disputes only. (b) Secondly, the right to refer disputes to international arbitration under Art 28(1) is limited exclusively to persons suing in a particular capacity (ie, as investors) and to disputes with a specific subject-matter (ie, concerning a host State’s obligations in relation to an admitted investment). 337 Clearly, the SADC Tribunal and the international arbitral body in Art 28(2) of Annex 1 do not fulfil the same purpose and function, and they have different jurisdictional conditions. As such,Mike Campbellcannot be “persuasive authority” that a national may bring a claim against his own Member State under Art 28(1). 338 For the reasons I have stated above, I do not think that Art 28(1) of Annex 1 was intended to accommodate domestic investors. In reaching this conclusion, I place no weight on the NAFTA, the CAFTA and the ECT. The mere fact that other investment treaties are exclusively concerned with foreign investors, without more, says nothing about the proper interpretation of Annex 1. My conclusion is consistent with the PCA Tribunal’s conclusion that it lacked jurisdictionratione personaeover Swissbourgh and the Tributees, although its conclusion was based on the assignment of their rights to the Burmilla Trust. 339 In this regard, I note that there is another subsidiary question concerning whether the second to fourth defendants are “investors” for the purposes of Annex 1. The second to fourth defendants did not own the Mining Leases and their only connection to them lies in their ownership of shares in Swissbourgh and the Tributees, from whom the Mining Leases were expropriated. However, the parties did not submit on this before me and it is hence unnecessary for me to consider it.",
        "Applicable law and principles of treaty interpretation": "88 As OS 492 engages novel and complex legal questions, I think it is prudent to set out the applicable laws and interpretive approach before exploring the Kingdom’s jurisdictional objections. An application to set aside an international arbitral award will typically involve different substantive laws applying at different strata. The treatise by Campbell McLachlan, Laurence Shore & Matthew Weiniger,International Investment Arbitration: Substantive Principles(Oxford University Press, 2nd Ed, 2017) (“McLachlan”) identifies the three following strata in an investor-State treaty arbitration: (a) First, the law applicable to the substance of the dispute (lex causae). The substantive law applied in a treaty arbitration is the treaty itself and the applicable law for the interpretation of the treaty is international law. The primary obligations (ie, the substantive rights provided by the treaty) that the investor seeks to enforce are thus interpreted according to public international law. However, subsidiary questions – for example, the nationality of a person, the validity of a right asserted to be an investment, or the purported breach of an investment contract – may require the interpretation and application of domestic law (seeMcLachlanat paras 1.63–1.68, 3.99, 3.107 and 3.128). (b) Secondly, the law applicable to the arbitration agreement between the investor and the State (seeMcLachlanat para 3.112). This is usually relevant where the arbitration clause is found in an investment contract to which the investor and the State are parties, but is not relevant here given that the arbitration agreement arises under Art 28 of Annex 1. (c) Thirdly, the law applicable to the arbitration procedure itself (lex arbitri). In the case of an international arbitration notconducted under the Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other States (18 March 1965) 575 UNTS 159 (entered into force 14 October 1966) (“the ICSID Convention”), the law governing the arbitration procedure would be municipal law and it is on this basis that national courts have reviewed the actions of bilateral investment treaty (“BIT”) tribunals (seeMcLachlanat para 3.113). 89 In this case, the Award does not expressly state the substantive law (lex causae) which the PCA Tribunal applied. However, since the dispute concerned alleged breaches of the Kingdom’s obligations under the SADC Treaty and protocols, it is clear that the SADC Treaty, its related protocols and the general principles of international law applicable to the interpretation of the same constitute thelex causae. 90 Unlike awards issued under the ICSID Convention, anad hocarbitration award is subject to the rules for enforcement and challenge in the same way as any private international arbitral award through the courts of the country where the tribunal had its seat (James Crawford,Brownlie’s Principles of Public International Law(Oxford University Press, 8th Ed, 2012) (“Brownlie”) at p 743). In setting-aside proceedings, the jurisdiction of the national courts is determined by the choice of the seat of arbitration, which provides the rules applicable to the proceedings. It was not disputed by the parties that Singapore law is the curial law of the arbitration for the purposes of OS 492. This followed from the PCA Tribunal’s choice of Singapore as the seat of the arbitration. 91 Applying Singapore law as thelex arbitri, the arbitration was clearly an “international” one within the meaning of s 5(2) of the IAA as the parties have no connection at all to Singapore. The applicable statute is therefore the IAA, s 3(1) of which gives the Model Law (with the exception of Chapter VIII) “the force of law in Singapore”. The grounds for setting aside the Award are found in s 24 of the IAA and Art 34 of the Model Law, given my view that s 10 of the IAA is inapplicable. 92 In determining the jurisdictional challenges brought under these provisions, the court is required first and foremost to interpret the arbitration agreement. In this case, that agreement is found in Annex 1. General international law principles of treaty interpretation are thus of relevance in OS 492. 93 It is commonly accepted that many provisions of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (23 May 1969) 1155 UNTS 331 (entered into force 27 January 1980) (“the VCLT”) are declaratory of customary international law, and its provisions are therefore regarded as applicable “irrespective of whether the VCLT appliesquatreaty in the given case” (Brownlieat pp 367–368; see alsoMcLachlanat para 7.85). In particular, the International Court of Justice (“the ICJ”) has recognised that Arts 31 and 32 of the VCLT reflect customary international law (see,eg,Case Concerning Application of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Bosnia and Herzegovina v Serbia and Montenegro)[2007] ICJ 43 at [160]). InSanum, the Court of Appeal noted (at [46]) that the rules of treaty interpretation are governed by Art 31 of the VCLT, which states: Article 31.GENERAL RULE OF INTERPRETATION 1.  A treaty shall be interpreted in good faith in accordance with the ordinary meaning to be given to the terms of the treaty in their context and in the light of its object and purpose. 2.  The context for the purpose of the interpretation of a treaty shall comprise, in addition to the text, including its preamble and annexes: (a) Any agreement relating to the treaty which was made between all the parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty; (b) Any instrument which was made by one or more parties in connexion with the conclusion of the treaty and accepted by the other parties as an instrument related to the treaty. 3.  There shall be taken into account, together with the context: (a) Any subsequent agreement between the parties regarding the interpretation of the treaty or the application of its provisions; (b) Any subsequent practice in the application of the treaty which establishes the agreement of the parties regarding its interpretation; (c) Any relevant rules of international law applicable in the relations between the parties. 4.  A special meaning shall be given to a term if it is established that the parties so intended. 94 Article 31(1) of the VCLT enshrines the principle of ordinary meaning. This functions as a presumption: a person advocating a meaning other than the ordinary meaning of words in the treaty bears the burden of establishing the special meaning. It is complemented by the principle of integration: “the meaning must emerge in the context of the treaty as a whole (including the text, its preamble and annexes, and any agreement or instrument related to the treaty and drawn up in connection with its conclusion) and in the light of its object and purpose” (Brownlieat p 381). 95 The approach under Art 31 of the VCLT is a holistic one, embracing the three aspects of ordinary meaning, context, and object and purpose. It has been described by the tribunal inAguas del Tunari, S.A. v Republic of Bolivia, ICSID Case No ARB/02/3, Decision on Respondent’s Objections to Jurisdiction, 21 October 2005 at [91] (cited inMcLachlanat para 3.130) as follows: Interpretation under [Art 31 of the VCLT] is a process of progressive encirclement where the interpreter starts under the general rule with (1) the ordinary meaning of the terms of the treaty, (2) in their context and (3) in light of the treaty’s object and purpose, and by cycling through this three step inquiry iteratively closes in upon the proper interpretation. … 96 The tribunal added: … [The VCLT] does not privilege any one of these three aspects of the interpretation method. The meaning of a word or phrase is not solely a matter of dictionaries and linguistics. … Rather, the interpretation of a word or phrase involves a complex task of considering the ordinary meaning of a work or phrase in the context in which that word or phrase is found and in light of the object and purpose of the document. … InSanum, the Court of Appeal adopted a similar approach in considering the ordinary meaning of the relevant words in the bilateral investment treaty entered into between the People’s Republic of China and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic (“PRC–Laos BIT”), the context of the PRC–Laos BIT, and its object and purpose (seeSanumat [125]et seq). 97 Article 31(3)(c) of the VCLT embodies whatMcLachlan(at para 7.95) terms a “principle of systemic integration”, which recognises that treaties are themselves creatures of international law and not a “self-contained closed legal system” (see also Bruno Simma & Dirk Pulkowski, “Two Worlds, but Not Apart: International Investment Law and General International Law” inInternational Investment Law(Marc Bungenberget al, eds) (C H Beck, Hart & Nomos, 2015) (“Bungenberg”) at p 361 and p 363 at para 6). Customary international law may intersect with investment treaty arbitration by, for example, shedding light on the meaning of the terms used by the treaty, stipulating rules or maxims of interpretation, delimiting the bounds of State responsibility and giving content to the international minimum standard of treatment (McLachlanat para 7.95; Simma & Pulkowski’s chapter inBungenbergat paras 6–16). Customary international law is most often used under Art 31(3)(c) where the treaty rule is unclear or open-textured and its meaning is determined by reference to a developed body of international law and/or the treaty terms have a recognised meaning in customary law, to which the parties can therefore be taken to have intended to refer (Report of the Study Group of the International Law Commission, “Fragmentation of International Law: Difficulties Arising from Diversification and Expansion of International Law”, UN GAOR, 58th Sess, UN Doc A/CN.4/L.682 (13 April 2006) at para 467). 98 Article 32 of the VCLT “cautiously qualifies” the textual approach enshrined in Art 31 by permitting recourse to further means of interpretation in certain circumstances (Brownlieat p 383). Article 32 states: Article 32. SUPPLEMENTARY MEANS OF INTERPRETATION Recourse may be had to supplementary means of interpretation, including the preparatory work of the treaty and the circumstances of its conclusion, in order to confirm the meaning resulting from the application of article 31, or to determine the meaning when the interpretation according to article 31: (a) Leaves the meaning ambiguous or obscure; or (b) Leads to a result which is manifestly absurd or unreasonable. 99 There was little opportunity to invoke Art 32 in this case. I invited the parties to tender thetravaux préparatoiresof the SADC Treaty and its protocols or annexes, but they did not do so. Thetravaux préparatoiresfor the Investment Protocol, in particular, were of interest to me. Counsel for the Kingdom explained that despite his best efforts, and presumably those of the Kingdom, the same could not be secured. This was unfortunate as thetravaux préparatoireswould have helped to shed light on some of the complex issues I had to grapple with. 100 Treaties should not be interpreted either liberally or restrictively (August Reinisch, “The Interpretation of International Investment Agreements” inBungenbergat p 397, para 53). Indeed, neither of these terms is part of Art 31(1) of the VCLT. The object and purpose of investment treaty interpretation can rarely, if ever, be reduced to an unequivocally pro-investor or a pro-State approach. Usually a BIT, as well as a multilateral investment treaty like the SADC Treaty, strikes a balance between investor protection and State interests. The tribunal inSaluka Investments BV vThe Czech Republic (Partial Award), PCA Case No 2001-04, 15 ICSID Rep 274, IIC 210 at [300] (cited inMcLachlanat para 1.90) astutely observed: … The protection of foreign investments is not the sole aim of the Treaty, but rather a necessary element alongside the overall aim of encouraging foreign investment and extending and intensifying the parties’ economic relations. That in turn calls for a balanced approach to the interpretation of the Treaty’s substantive provisions for the protection of investments, since an interpretation which exaggerates the protection to be accorded to foreign investments may serve to dissuade host States from admitting foreign investments and so undermine the overall aim of extending and intensifying the parties’ mutual economic relations. 101 Similarly, the tribunal inDaimlerFinancial Services AG v ArgentinaRepublic, ICSID Case No ARB/05/1, Award, 22 August 2012, observed at [161] (referred to with approval inMcLachlanat para 3.150): … In considering [the] interpretation [of the relevant BIT], it is essential to recall that BITs are reciprocal bilateral treaties negotiated between two sovereign State parties. The general purpose of BITs is of course primarily to protect and promote foreign investment; but it is to do so within the framework acceptable to both of the State parties. These two aspects must always be held in tension. They are theyinandyangof bilateral investment treaties and cannot be separated without doing violence to the will of the states that conclude such treaties. It is in this context that the exact wording of dispute resolution clauses plays a key role, as such clauses are one of the privileged places where the imbalances between the interests of both parties are often precisely defined as a result of the treaty’s negotiation process. 102 An interpretation of the SADC Treaty and Annex 1 likewise must take into account the object and purpose of those instruments in light of both the potential interests of investors as well as those of the SADC Member States. This is an important consideration in this matter. 103 Another pertinent question is the value to be ascribed to past decisions of other international tribunals and courts. There is no system of precedent in international law. Past decisions have no precedential value even where the same treaty or State is involved (McLachlanat para 3.158). That said, “ade factodoctrine of precedent for investment treaty arbitration definitely exists” and investment tribunals approach their task “by carefully considering the work of other tribunals” (McLachlanat para 3.164). The consensus appears to be that this is both conducive to the development of ajurisprudence constantein international investment law, and helpful to individual tribunals in examining how similar issues have been resolved or as illustrating the application of established principles (Marc Bungenberg & Catharine Titi, “Precedents in International Investment Law” inBungenbergat pp 1508–1510, paras 4–7). It is important, however, to analyse particular cases in context – “both as to their functional response to the subject-matter of the claim, and as to their consistency with the overall development of the law in this area” (McLachlanat para 7.100). 104 With that, I turn to the Kingdom’s jurisdictional objections. In investment treaty disputes, the arbitrator’s jurisdiction can be analysed within the framework of three core elements – jurisdictionratione temporis, jurisdictionratione materiaeand jurisdictionratione personae. First, the tribunal lacks jurisdictionratione temporisif the dispute falls foul of temporal restrictions in the investment treaty. For example, the investment treaty may limit the tribunal’s jurisdiction to disputes arising after the treaty’s entry into force or to investments made after that time. Secondly, a dispute is beyond the tribunal’s jurisdictionratione materiaeif its subject matter is not capable of being submitted to arbitration under the investment treaty. For example, investment treaties may require the dispute to pertain to such “investment” as is defined in the treaty. Third, the tribunal lacks jurisdictionratione personaeif one of the parties before it lacks standing in the arbitration proceedings, say if he or she is not an “investor” within the meaning of the treaty or not a national of a signatory State. I address the Kingdom’s jurisdictional objections in the following sequence: (a) First, the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdictionratione temporisover the dispute, which arose before the entry into force of Annex 1 and thus fell foul of Art 28(4) of Annex 1 (at [105]–[180]). (b) Secondly, the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdictionratione materiaebecause the dispute did not have the necessary connection to an “investment” within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 (at [181]–[228]). (c) Thirdly, the defendants’ purported investment had not been “admitted” within the meaning of Art 28(1) (at [229]–[252]). (d) Fourthly, the dispute was not one which concerned an “obligation” of the Kingdom “in relation to” the defendants’ purported investment within the meaning of Art 28(1) (at [253]–[277]). (e) Fifthly, the dispute was not one in relation to which the defendants had exhausted local remedies, which was a requirement under Art 28(1) (at [278]–[319]). (f) Sixthly, the PCA Tribunal lacked jurisdictionratione personaeover Swissbourgh and the Tributees, who were not capable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and thus lacked standing to commence the arbitration (at [320]–[339]).",
        "First objection: jurisdictionratione temporis": "105 Article 28(4) of Annex 1 states that “[t]he provisions of this Article shall not apply to adispute, which arose before entry into force of this Annex” [emphasis added]. Annex 1 entered into force on 16 April 2010 (see [31(c)] above). As I have said, the defendants characterised the dispute as one concerning the Kingdom’s participation in the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal from 2010 to 2014 (the shuttering dispute), and took pains to emphasise that the arbitration didnotconcern the Kingdom’s alleged expropriation of the Mining Leases (the expropriation dispute). The Kingdom, on the other hand, submitted that the defendants’ characterisation was an “artifice”. The “real dispute” had to be objectively determined by the PCA Tribunal, and was the expropriation dispute, which had arisen well before April 2010. This is a key point because if the Kingdom’s contention is correct, the dispute was beyond the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdictionratione temporisas it arose before the entry into force of Annex 1.",
        "PCA Tribunal’s findings": "323 The PCA Tribunal addressed the three following questions (Award at [7.65]). First, could Swissbourgh and the Tributees be “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) given that they were locally incorporated companies? Secondly, were the JVZF Trust and the Burmilla Trust (the third and fourth defendants) “persons” capable of bringing a claim under Art 28(1)? Thirdly, was the Burmilla Trust the only entity with rights which were capable of being the subject of a claim under Art 28(1) of Annex 1? 324 I will only summarise the PCA Tribunal’s findings on the first question, since that is the crux of the parties’ disagreement in OS 492. The PCA Tribunal found that Art 28(1) was available to both local and foreign investors. The term “investor” was defined in Art 1(2) of Annex 1 as “a person who has been admitted to make or has made an investment”, without distinguishing between local and foreign persons. “Person” was in turn defined as “a natural person or a company”, and “company” was in turn defined as “any entity constituted or organised under the applicable laws of any State…”. These definitions drew no distinction between the host State and other States and the PCA Tribunal refused to imply “an additional requirement” into the Investment Protocol (at [7.71]). While it was “unusual to find an investment treaty that applies to both foreign and domestic investors alike” since most investment treaties expressly excluded domestic investors from bringing claims against their own government, no such provision was found in the SADC Treaty and Investment Protocol (at [7.68]). Swissbourgh and the Tributees thus fell within the plain reading of the definition of “investor”. 325 The PCA Tribunal also relied onMike Campbell (Pvt) Limited andWilliam Michael Campbell v The Republic of Zimbabwe, SADC(T) Case No 2/2007, [2008] SADCT 2 (“Mike Campbell”), a ruling in theCampbell v Zimbabwecase in which the SADC Tribunal confirmed that a domestic entity could bring a case against its own government under Art 15(1) of the Tribunal Protocol (Award at [7.69]). Although this case did not involve the Investment Protocol specifically, the SADC Member States would have made it amply clear had they intended jurisdiction to differ between the Tribunal Protocol and the Investment Protocol.",
        "The Dissenting Opinion": "283 Justice Nienaber identified the “ultimate remedy” sought by the defendants as compensation for the loss of their mining rights (Dissenting Opinion at [4.4]). The question was whether any local remedies had existed for this claim in 2012, when the arbitration proceedings were commenced. He identified two such remedies: (a) An Aquilian action for pure economic loss,ie, an action for “patrimonial loss not attributable to any physical injury to person or damage to property but nevertheless resulting from the [Kingdom’s] alleged wrongful (i.e. unlawful) and culpable conduct” (Dissenting Opinion at [4.14]). This delictual action had been “vigorously developed” in recent times by the South African Supreme Court of Appeal and would have been available in the Kingdom (at [4.15]). While the South African decisions did not bind the Kingdom’s courts, they would nevertheless have a “strong persuasive effect” as both common law systems are based on Roman-Dutch law (at [4.12]). The Kingdom’s Court of Appeal had in fact recognised the existence of “a claim for pure economic loss” in the case ofMpotaMoiloa v Raohang Banna Le Basali[2009] LSCA 20 (“Moiloa v Raohang”) at [10]. Such a claim would result in “the very damages claimed by the [defendants] for the expropriation of the [M]ining [L]eases and for being deprived of the opportunity of recovering that loss by reason of the shuttering of the SADC Tribunal” (at [4.34]). (b) The defendants could have pursued pending actions for compensation in the Kingdom’s domestic courts, which the defendants had either withdrawn or failed to pursue to their conclusion. Justice Nienaber referred toVan Zyland others v Government of RSAand others[2007] SCA 109 (RSA) (“Van Zyl v South Africa”) (the defendants’ application for diplomatic protection from South Africa), which made it clear that “as a matter of fact and law all available remedies have not been exhausted in Lesotho” (Dissenting Opinion at [4.37]). 284 In Justice Nienaber’s view, the majority’s approach of considering whether the Kingdom’s courts could have ordered the same injunctive relief as an international tribunal (ie, the constitution of a new tribunal to hear the SADC claim) put the horse before the cart. The question of whether local remedies had been exhausted was logically prior to the question of what relief an international tribunal ought to order, as the latter question presupposed that the tribunal had jurisdiction (at [4.22]). 285 Finally, Justice Nienaber rejected any notion that the Kingdom’s domestic courts would be biased against the defendants or would not judge fairly, given their readiness to be “critical and dismissive of the actions of [their] own government even during the earlier stages of the … proceedings” (at [4.29] (fn)).",
        "Second objection: whether there was an “investment” – jurisdictionratione materiae": "181 Under Art 28(1) of Annex 1 (reproduced at [40] above), the dispute must concern an obligation which relates to “an admitted investment”. It is important therefore to first identify clearly and accurately what in fact is the investment concerning which it is alleged that a dispute has arisen. There is also the ancillary issue of whether such investment was admitted, which I shall address later. “Investment” is defined in Art 1(2) of Annex 1 as follows: “investment”means the purchase, acquisition or establishment of productive and portfolio investment assets, and in particular, though not exclusively, includes: (a) movable and immovable property and any other property rights such as mortgages, liens or pledges; (b) shares, stocks and debentures of companies or interest in the property of such companies; (c) claims to money or to any performance under contract having a financial value, and loans; (d) copyrights, know-how (goodwill) and industrial property rights such as patents for inventions, trade marks, industrial designs and trade names; (e) rights conferred by law or under contract, including licences to search for, cultivate, extract or exploit natural resources: … 182 One consequence of the defendants characterising their dispute as theshuttering disputerather than theexpropriation dispute(which would have fallen foul of Art 28(4) of Annex 1) was that the corresponding “investment” was not the Mining Leases, but the right to refer the dispute to the SADC Tribunal. This is an inevitable result. The Award characterised the investment variously as “an international law right to seek compensation for an expropriation of the investment” (at [7.31]); “the right to claim for compensation” (at [7.38]); “the unheard claim” (at [7.104]); “the claim to compensation” (at [7.107]); the “secondary right to seek relief from the SADC Tribunal in respect of the taking of the primary rights” (at [7.164]) and an “international law right to have their claim heard by the SADC tribunal” (at [7.229])etc. The defendants’ written submissions characterised their investment as the “secondaryright to bring the SADC Tribunal Claim” [emphasis in original] (at para 90); the “secondary right to claim for compensation” (at para 91); “the [d]efendants’ right to claim for compensation” (at para 92); the “right to bring a claim before the SADC Tribunal” (at para 108); “the [d]efendants’ right to bring the SADC Tribunal Claim” (at paras 142–143);etc. It is thus clear that the alleged investment is not the defendants’ claim to compensationper se, but rather arightto claim for compensation before the SADC Tribunal for the expropriation of the Mining Leases. This also distinguishes the present case fromMondev v USAandChevron v Ecuador, in which the lawsuits themselves (rather than the right to sue) were the “investment”.",
        "Third objection: whether the investment was “admitted”": "",
        "Fourth objection: whether there was an “obligation in relation to” an admitted investment": "",
        "Fifth objection: whether the defendants exhausted local remedies": "278 Article 28(1) of Annex 1 states that disputes may only be submitted to international arbitration “after exhausting local remedies”. It follows that a dispute in respect of which local remedies have not been exhausted is a dispute not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration for the purposes of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law.",
        "Sixth objection: whether the defendants were “investors”": "320 Another jurisdictional objection raised by the Kingdom was that Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not capable of qualifying as “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. However, this objection appears to be largely academic. Although the PCA Tribunal found that all nine defendants were capable of being “investors” regardless of whether they were domestic or foreign, it also found that Swissbourgh and the Tributees had assigned their rights to pursue their claims against the Kingdom for its alleged expropriation of rights under the Mining Leases and Tributing Agreements to the Burmilla Trust. This assignment was not denied by either the defendants or the Kingdom (Award at [7.77]). As a result, the PCA Tribunal found that the second to fourth defendants were “the proper parties to pursue the … claim”. Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and their claims were dismissed. In the Interpretation (see [52] above), the PCA Tribunal further clarified that it only had jurisdiction over the second to fourth defendants and could not make (and had not made) any ordervis-à-visSwissbourgh and the Tributees. There was hence no basis on which I could set aside the Award for excess of jurisdictionratione personae. 321 The defendants, on the other hand, sought to persuade me that the PCA Tribunal had erred in finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Swissbourgh and the Tributees. But the defendants had not applied to set the Award aside, either in whole or in part, and it was not clear what remedy they had in mind. Although parties did not address me on this point, I have doubts whether this court has jurisdiction to review that ruling or set the Award (or that part of the Award pertaining to lack of jurisdiction over Swissbourgh and the Tributees) aside on that ground at thedefendants’ instance, for the following reasons: (a) The court’s jurisdiction to set aside an arbitral award derives from either s 10 or s 24 of the IAA, or Art 34 of the Model Law. The limbs in s 24 are not made out, leaving s 10 of the IAA and Art 34. (b) However, the defendants did not bring an application under s 10 of the IAA. While the Kingdom filed OS 492 under s 10(3) of the IAA, it only did so in respect of the PCA Tribunal’spositivejurisdictional ruling. (c) Turning to Art 34 of the Model Law, none of the limbs in Art 34 appears to envisage a situation where the arbitral tribunal wrongly found that itlackedjurisdiction over a party to the dispute. In particular, Art 34(2)(a)(i) is for setting aside apositivejurisdictional ruling (ie, that the tribunal did have jurisdiction over the parties). It was for this reason that s 10 of the IAA was amended to allow the supervisory court to review a negative jurisdictional ruling. 322 For these reasons, I am not confident that I would have the jurisdiction to order any relief even if I were to disagree with the PCA Tribunal’s finding that it lacked jurisdiction over Swissbourgh and the Tributees. Nevertheless, since parties addressed this objection in their submissions, I will give my reasons for my view that Swissbourgh and the Tributees are not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1 and that the PCA Tribunal was right to find that it lacked jurisdiction over them (albeit on different grounds).",
        "Conclusion on setting aside": "340 In summary, my conclusions on each of the Kingdom’s jurisdictional objections are as follows: (a) The dispute submitted to arbitration was the shuttering dispute, which was within the PCA Tribunal’s jurisdictionratione temporisunder Art 28(4) of Annex 1. (b) The defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal was not an “investment” within the meaning of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. (c) Nor was it “admitted” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1. (d) The shuttering dispute did not concern any obligation of the Kingdom’s in relation to the purported investment (ie, the defendants’ right to submit disputes to the SADC Tribunal). (e) The defendants failed to exhaust local remedies, in particular, an Aquilian action for financial loss. (f) Swissbourgh and the Tributees were not “investors” for the purposes of Art 28(1) of Annex 1, and this was consistent with the PCA Tribunal’s ruling that it lacked jurisdiction over them, although the PCA Tribunal had come to that view on different grounds. 341 It follows that, in my view, the Award dealt with a dispute not contemplated by and not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration and thereby fell foul of Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. While the court retains a residual discretion not to set aside an award even where grounds under Art 34(2) of the Model Law are made out, this discretion should only be exercised “if no prejudice has been sustained by the aggrieved party” (CRW Joint Operationat [100]). That is clearly not the case here because jurisdiction has been wrongly assumed. I therefore set aside the Award in entirety. In the circumstances, there is no need for me to address the Kingdom’s arguments for specifically setting aside only the portion of the Award which awarded the costs of the arbitration to the defendants. I allow prayer 2 of the OS only (ie, only [53(a)(ii)] above and not [53(a)(i)] or [53(b)]). 342 As the Kingdom has prevailed in OS 492, I award the costs of OS 492 to the Kingdom, to be taxed if not agreed. 343 As I observed earlier, investment treaties are fine-tuned to balance the interests of host States and investors, and it would be ultimately counteractive to a treaty’s object and purpose to extend its protections to situations clearly beyond its contemplation. While the defendants are understandably disappointed with the turn their investment has taken, that cannot be cured by doing violence to a dispute resolution provision in the treaty. The defendants’ difficulties in establishing jurisdiction stem from the fact that their true investment – the Mining Leases – was made before Annex 1’s entry into force. The remarks of the tribunal inLucchetti v Peruat [61] are apt in these circumstances: Lucchetti may therefore consider it a harsh result that its effort at obtaining an international remedy is brought to a halt before the merits of its contentions are even examined. Such a conclusion, however, would not be warranted in light of the fact that Lucchetti did not have ana priorientitlement to this international forum. It cannot say that it made its investment in reliance on the BIT, for the simple reason that the treaty did not exist until years after Lucchetti had acquired the site, built its factory, and was well into the second year of full production. It cannot conceivably contend that it invested in reliance on the existence of this international remedy.",
        "Costs of the arbitral proceedings": "344 That leaves the question of the costs of the arbitration. Two questions arise. The first is whether the court has jurisdiction to make an order as to the costs of the arbitration. The second question is, if so, what costs order would be appropriate. The Kingdom submitted that the PCA Tribunal wasfunctus officioas regards the question of liability for costs and urged me to award the costs of both the arbitration and of OS 492 in its favour. The defendants did not explicitly dispute that I had jurisdiction to do so but submitted that if I were to set aside the Award, I ought to leave the question of allocation of the costs of the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal, which was better-placed to deal with that question. 345 There is doubt as to whether I am able to remit the question of costs in the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal. The PCA Tribunal would appear to befunctus officio, having issued a final and binding award in respect of the matters submitted to it (s 19B of the IAA; see alsoAKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals[2016] 1 SLR 966 (“AKN v ALC”) at [18]). Article 34(4) of the Model Law, which exhaustively sets out the court’s power of remission, “does not empower the court to remit any matteraftersetting aside an award” [emphasis in original] (AKN v ALCat [22]). 346 However, in the event that I am unable to remit the question of costs in the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal, what would become of the costs in the arbitration? In this regard, I note that s 10(7) of the IAA empowers a High Court Judge who hears an appeal against jurisdiction under that section to make an order of costs in the arbitration. But the Award here is being set aside not under s 10 of the IAA but under Art 34 of the Model Law, which does not confer an equivalent power. In the absence of legislative provision, it would seem that there is certainly an argument that I have no power to make such an order:Crest Nicholson (Eastern) Limited v Mr and Mrs Western[2008] EWHC 1325 (TCC) at [54]. In fact, s 10(7) of the IAA was introduced precisely to plug such a lacuna in the context of s 10: see the Law Reform Committee Report at para 31. 347 Assuming that I have jurisdiction to make an order of costs in the arbitration, what should be the quantum? I note that the PCA Tribunal awarded the defendants the costs of the arbitrationas well as the defendants’ reasonable legal costs, which the PCA Tribunal described as a “growing trend in investment arbitration” (Award at [10.7]). The PCA Tribunal also set this sum off against costs which the defendants had been ordered to pay the Kingdom in domestic proceedings in the courts of Lesotho. These are issues on which the parties did not submit. In the circumstances, I will hear further submissions from the parties on two issues: (a) whether the court has jurisdiction to remit the costs of the arbitration to the PCA Tribunal for assessment or to make an order of the costs of the arbitration itself; and, (b) the quantum of such costs on the assumption the court has jurisdiction. 348 Finally, it leaves me to thank both counsel for their excellent assistance and submissions. Steven Chong J (as he then was) noted in hearing the application for Mr Wordsworth QC’s admission that this was a matter that “tick[ed] all four boxes of complexity, difficulty, novelty and precedential value” (Re Wordsworth, Samuel Sherratt QC[2016] 5 SLR 179 at [52]). I could not agree more. Counsel’s assistance was tremendously helpful to me in navigating the difficult issues I have had to address.   Kannan RameshJudge  Samuel Sherratt Wordsworth, QC (instructed counsel, Essex Court Chambers, London), Paul Tan Beng Hwee and Alessa Pang Yi Ching (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the plaintiff;Alvin Yeo Khirn Hai, SC, Koh Swee Yen, Smitha Rajan Menon, Oh Sheng Loong, Mak Shin Yi and Tara Radakrishnan (WongPartnership LLP) for the defendants."
