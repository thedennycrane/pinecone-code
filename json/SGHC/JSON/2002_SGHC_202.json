        "The Affidavits": "11.        The Plaintiffs’\n\nfiled one affidavit in support of the application. This was the affidavit of Hia Cheng\n\nfiled on 29 July 2002. Hia Cheng is the Finance & Trading manager of the Plaintiffs.\n\nThe Defendants filed one affidavit to oppose the application. On 2 August 2002, Elaine\n\nQuek Ee Ling (\"Elaine\") affirmed an affidavit on behalf of the Defendants.\n\nElaine is the manager of Foong Sun.12.        On 5 and 6 August 2002,\n\nthe Plaintiffs filed two other affidavits. Those two affidavits were sworn by the\n\nPlaintiffs’ counsel, Lawrence Lee, in support of the Plaintiffs’ application for\n\nfurther arguments. The Defendants naturally objected to their use as they were filed\n\nwithout leave and after I had dismissed the application. For completeness, I should\n\nmention that I declined to hear further arguments.",
        "The Plaintiffs’ case": "13.        In this interlocutory\n\napplication, the Defendants did not touch on the Plaintiffs’ assertion that they have\n\n\"a good arguable case\", prefering to resist the application on the ground that\n\nthe Plaintiffs have not establised any risk of dissipation of assets.14.        It was said on behalf of\n\nthe Plaintiffs that a risk of dissipation of the assets is to be inferred from the\n\nfollowing facts:(i) the Defendants became a one-ship company after \"PRATIWI\"\n\nwas sold. The Defendants subsequently sold their only asset \"LANGSA\". The\n\nDefendants appeared to be no longer in business.(ii) the timing of the sale of the \"LANGSA\". The sale was on\n\n22 June 2002 after the Defendants were informed that the Plaintiffs’ cargo\n\nunderwriters had repudiated liability and after M/s Zaid Ibrahim & Partners and CSGL\n\nhad written to the Defendants and China Insurance demanding payment of the claim. The\n\nPlaintiffs had earlier informed Foong Sun that they would claim from their cargo\n\nunderwriters.(iii) the length of time the Defendants have been in business. The\n\nDefendants appeared to have started business from early 2001.(iv) Asset to be attached is the sale proceeds, which by its very\n\nnature is easily dissipated.(v) The Defendants are not incorporated in a country where a Singapore\n\njudgment may be registered.(vi) The Defendants’ liability cover is for S$500,000 and the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim is for S$904,164.22.",
        "The Defendants’ case": "15.        Elaine denied the\n\nPlaintiffs’ accusation that the Defendants were \"trying to hide their\n\nassets\". The Defendants had in the past on numerous occasions shipped cargo on board\n\nthe \"LANGSA\". The \"PRATIWI\" and \"LANGSA\" used to ply\n\nregularly between Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia. She was perplexed to see Hia\n\nCheng’s statement that the Plaintiffs did not know until July 2002 that the\n\nDefendants also owned the \"LANGSA\". The Plaintiffs’ lawyers had ascertained\n\nthe ownership of \"LANGSA\" from Lloyds’ Register. It was wrong to state that\n\nit was not easy to trace the ownership of \"LANGSA\" to the Defendants. The\n\ninsinuation that the Defendants carry on business in an elusive manner was baseless.16.        I should mention that\n\nthis business relationship with Foong Sun appeared more than cordial as the Plaintiffs\n\nwere able to discreetly obtain from Foong Sun’s staff, information such as (i)\n\n\"PRATIWI\" had no hull cover and (ii) the \"LANGSA\" had changed name to\n\n\"SRI BAHARI\". The \"SRI BAHARI\" is managed by Foong Sun and the\n\nPlaintiffs in July 2002 had shipped cargo on board that vessel.17.        Elaine said in paragraph\n\n18 of her affidavit that the \"LANGSA\" was sold to an Indonesian concern PT Fajar\n\nSribahari Sakti for US$ 150,000. The Bill of Sale was dated 22 June 2002.",
        "Decision": "18.        The Plaintiffs’\n\napplication is to attach assets belonging to the Defendants within and outside the\n\njurisdiction.19.        InSSAB Oxelosund AB v\n\nXendral Trading Pte Ltd[1992] 1 SLR 600, the defendants successfully set aside the\n\nex-parte order prohibiting the defendants, their servants or agents from disposing the\n\nhull proceeds following the sinking of the vessel \"PROTEKTOR\" with her cargo on\n\nboard in severe weather. Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she then was) held that a worldwide mareva\n\ninjunction order is a draconian measure to be ordered only in exceptional circumstances.\n\nSee alsoWallace Kevin James v Merrill Lynch International Bank Ltd[1998] 1 SLR 785at 793 andRepublic of Haiti & Ors v Duvalier & Ors[1990] 1QB 202 at\n\n215. The situation must be so exceptional as to \"cry out\" as a matter of justice\n\nto the plaintiffs for an order covering foreign assets of the defendants before judgment:\n\nKerr LJ inBabanaft International Co SA v Bassatne[1990] Ch 13 at 3320.        In my view, the facts in\n\nevidence relied upon by the Plaintiffs do not even satisfy the test for a mareva\n\ninjunction of assets within Singapore let alone an order to attach assets outside the\n\njurisdiction where a more stringent test is demanded. A plaintiff seeking to freeze assets\n\nwithin the jurisdiction must as a pre-condition to the grant of the injunction adduce\n\n\"solid evidence\" of a risk of dissipation:Choy Chee Keen Collin v Public\n\nUtilities Board[1997] 1 SLR 604;Petromar Energy Resources Pte Ltd v Glencore\n\nInternational AG[1999] 2 SLR 609.21.        I was not persuaded by\n\nthe Plaintiffs that on the affidavit evidence taken as a whole the behaviour of the\n\nDefendants was such as to seek to frustrate, or was in a way designed or calculated to\n\nfrustrate a judgment in favour of the Plaintiffs.22.        It is true that the\n\nDefendants became a one-ship company after the \"PRATIWI\" was sold. It is\n\ngenerally an accepted way of ship owning and doing business in the shipping world.23.        Lai Siu Chiu JC (as she\n\nthen was) inSSAB Oxelosund AB v Xendral Trading Pte Ltdat p 607 observed that\n\none-ship company \"is a norm rather than an exception in the shipowing industry\".24.        Again, Amarjeet JC InThe\n\nSkaw Prince[1994] 3 SLR 379at p 386 said:\"It is well known that businesses engaged in shipping set up and\n\n    utilize one-ship companies within their corporate structure for the purpose of limiting\n\n    liability. The device has been around and recognized by the courts as a legitimate one\n\n    ..\"25.        Chan Sek Keong J inEuropean\n\nGrain & Shipping Ltd Compania Naviera Euro-Asia SA & Ors[1990] 2 MLJ 291at\n\n294 commented:\".. There was nothing wrong, from a commercial stand point of\n\n    view, for SSC from carrying on its business through Panamanian companies; this was a\n\n    normal method of carrying on shipping business and, in my view did not imply dishonesty or\n\n    craftiness(in its derogatory sense) on the part of the directors or shareholders.\"In that case, SSC was a substantial company and the way it carried on\n\nbusiness did not cast suspicion in the Judge’s mind as to the bona fides of the SSC\n\ngroup in the way it had carried on its businesses.26.        The Defendants are a\n\ncompany incorporated in Panama. The very fact of incorporation there might have resulted\n\nin an adverse inference being drawn against such entities in some cases. But in the\n\npresent case, there exists other evidence that tended to countermand or mitigate the\n\nnegative effect of a Panamanian incorporated company. It cannot be said that the\n\nDefendants before and after the casualty had been elusive in the way they did business and\n\nheld assets.27.        The Defendants have\n\nbusiness presence here through managers, Foong Sun. They had properly insured against\n\nliability arising from their activities as shipowners and carriers well before the\n\ncasualty and their liability insurers, China Insurance Limited, carry on business in\n\nSingapore.28.        I agree with the\n\nDefendants’ contention that if indeed the Defendants were attempting to make\n\nthemselves judgment proof, they would have sold the \"LANGSA\" shortly after the\n\nfire instead of waiting for almost a year. In the course of the year, prior to 22 June\n\n2002, the Defendants continued to do business with their remaining vessel\n\n\"LANGSA\".29.        Hia Cheng in his\n\naffidavit asserts that there was an ownership change and change of name of the\n\n\"LANGSA\" to \"SRI BAHARI\". Elaine in her affidavit confirmed the sale\n\nof \"LANGSA\" on 22 June 2002. She deposed that the Defendants have not yet\n\nreceived the sale proceeds of US$150,000 from the buyers.30.        I should mention that the\n\nacknowledgement of receipt of the sale proceeds on the standard form Bill of Sale was\n\ninconsistent with Elaine Quek’s evidence. This apparent discrepancy was not lost on\n\nCounsel for the Plaintiffs. However, he submitted that he was not taking issue with this\n\ninconsistency, preferring to accept the evidence that the proceeds of sale have not yet\n\nbeen paid.31.        Counsel for the\n\nPlaintiffs in his letter dated 8 August 2002 for further arguments, however questioned\n\nwhether the sale of \"LANGSA\" was an attempt to dissipate the Defendants’\n\nasset. He argued that the sale of \"LANGSA\" could not have been in the\n\n\"ordinary and proper course of business\". Having regard to the timing of the\n\nsale and no explanation being afforded for the sale. The Bill of Sale was signed by Elaine\n\nfor the Defendants and \"SRI BAHARI\" is now managed by Foong Sun.32.        I do not agree with\n\nCounsel’s contention. If that were so, I see no reason for Elaine to disclose in her\n\naffidavit that the sale proceeds have not yet been paid. It would have been easy enough\n\nand consistent with nefarious conduct to rely on the acknowledgement of receipt in the\n\nBill of Sale, which would have left the Defendants with no known asset and the Plaintiffs\n\nno chance to attach intact the sale proceeds of US$150,000. Elaine’s disclosure is\n\ncontrary to any manifest intention to avoid a judgment in the Plaintiffs’ favour.33.        It was said that the sale\n\ntook place after the Plaintiffs’ lawyers came on the scene and demanded payment of\n\nthe claim. The Defendants were aware that the Plaintiffs would be claiming under their\n\ncargo policy. They were also subsequently aware that cargo underwriters had repudiated\n\npolicy liability in April 2002 and the Plaintiffs would therefore be looking to the\n\nDefendants for compensation. I cannot see how from those facts an inference can be drawn\n\nthat the Defendants had rid themselves of their only asset the \"LANGSA\" to\n\nrender themselves judgment proof.34.        The Defendants would\n\ninevitably be faced with a suit regardless of whether or not cargo underwriters paid under\n\nthe cargo policy. The only difference is that if cargo underwriters paid on the claim, the\n\nlatter would be pursuing a recovery action by way of subrogation.35.        What is obvious is that\n\nneither cargo underwriters nor their insured took steps immediately after the casualty to\n\nenhance their recovery prospects. Ordinarily, whenever there is a shipping casualty of\n\nthis kind, a pre-emptive strike would invariable have been taken in early days by cargo\n\nunderwriters (albeit without prejudice to policy liability) with the cooperation of the\n\ninsured for mutual benefit.36.        The Defendants were aware\n\nat the outset that the Plaintiffs had held them responsible for the damage to the cocoa\n\nbeans. Foong Sun had denied liability on behalf of the Defendants. In October 2001, Foong\n\nSun disclosed to cargo surveyors, McLarens Toplis International Loss Adjusters, that the\n\nDefendants are insured with China Insurance for shipowner’s liability as carrier\n\nunder Hague/Hague-Visby Rules up to a maximum sum of S$500,000 for any one accident. Foong\n\nSun even provided the Plaintiffs with a copy of the cover note in June 2002. The cargo\n\nliability cover is subject to a deductible of $10,000 for each and every claim.37.        Hia Cheng in paragraph 18\n\nof his affidavit deposed that Tey How Keong of the Plaintiffs had in early 2002 informed\n\nElaine that the Plaintiffs intended to seek compensation from Foong Sun. On 16 May 2002,\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ Malaysian lawyers, Zaid Ibrahim & Co, wrote to China Insurance to\n\nclaim RM 1,948,253.08. China Insurance sent on 14 June 2002 a standard reply stating that\n\nthey were looking into the matter. On 18 June 2002, KTP on instructions of China Insurance\n\nwrote to the Malaysian lawyers denying liability. They advised that under Art IV R2(b) of\n\nHague–Visby Rules, the carrier would have a complete defence to the cargo claim. The\n\nPlaintiffs were invited to withdraw their claim. On the same date, CSGL wrote to the\n\nDefendants c/o Foong Sun. They demanded payment of RM1,948,253.08 by 21 June 2002 failing\n\nwhich legal action would be taken. KTP repeated the Defendants’ defence to the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim.38.        CSGL disagreed with KTP\n\nand told them so on 20 June 2002. They advised that the Plaintiffs intended to press on\n\nwith their claim unless the Defendants admitted liability and pay RM1,948,253.08. In the\n\nsame letter, they requested details of the Defendants such as place of incorporation,\n\naddress and assets.39.        Hia Cheng complained in\n\nhis affidavit that the Defendants were being deliberately evasive about disclosing their\n\nregistered address and assets. It would be nave to expect the Defendants to willingly\n\nrespond to the request knowing as KTP did that the Plaintiffs were making the inquiries\n\nwith a particular objective in mind. KTP were not wrong. It was admitted in CSGL’s\n\nletter of 8 August 2002 that the information requested was to support the application for\n\nmareva injunction. Of course, if the Plaintiffs had on Hia Cheng’s affidavit\n\nestablished a prima facie inference of a risk of dissipation, the Defendants would have to\n\nadduce rebuttal evidence. Elaine’s response that they were advised that they were not\n\nunder a legal obligation to assist would not have been good enough.40.        There is no cogent\n\nevidence that the sale of the \"LANGSA\" was a sham. This is obvious from\n\nCSGL’s letter dated 6 August 2002 wherein they wanted to verify the sale by asking\n\nfor information concerning the relationship between the Defendants, their managers and\n\nbuyers of the \"LANGSA\". KTP pointed out in their letter of 7 August 2002 that\n\nthe Plaintiffs were simply fishing for information to test the genuineness of the sale and\n\nperhaps with a view to proceedings against the \"LANGSA\" in rem. The Plaintiffs\n\nhad issued an in rem writ on 12 July 2002 against the \"PRATIWI\". The in rem writ\n\nwas amended on 16 July 2002 to include the vessel \"LANGSA\".41.        It is probably true that\n\nafter the sale of the \"LANGSA\", the Defendants are no longer in business. It is\n\nnot an unreasonable inference. However, neither can it be said that the situation is bound\n\nto be a permanent one. Although the Defendants did not specifically address this point,\n\nthere is evidence that the Defendants were minded to see an amicable resolution of the\n\nmatter, which in my view, went some way to neutralise the inference.42.        Hia Cheng said in his\n\naffidavit that Elaine’s preference was to settle the matter without legal\n\nproceedings. But as it turned out the Plaintiffs’ instructed Malaysian and Singapore\n\nlawyers to deal with the claim. In fact KTP on 26 July 2002 after commenting on the tenor\n\nof CSGL’s letter of 26 July 2002 remarked: \"..we assume that your fax of today\n\nis not part of any attempts at an amicable resolution of this matter.\"43.        There is also no evidence\n\nthat the Defendants’ liability insurers would not pay on the claim if liability\n\nagainst the Defendants were established. In fact KTP are defending the claim on\n\ninstructions from China Insurance. The fact that the liability cover is less than the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim amount cannot merit the court granting a mareva injunction. It is\n\nthe sort of commercial risk any cargo interests in the position of the Plaintiffs would\n\nface.44.        For those reasons, I\n\nrefused the Plaintiffs’ application for a mareva injunction and ordered costs fixed\n\nat $1,800 against the Plaintiffs..Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
