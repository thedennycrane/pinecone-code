        "Evidence of SSgt Goh Teck Hock": "26.    SSgt Goh\n\nTeck Hock testified that at about 2.15 p.m. he heard on the radio set that a Malaysian\n\nvehicle JDF 755 had arrived at the car park behind Block 489. He stationed himself at the\n\nvoid deck of Block 487 to keep observation. He saw the driver of JDF 755 alight from his\n\nvehicle and use his handphone at the void deck of Block 489. A short while later, he\n\nreturned to his car, opened the driver’s side of the car. He then saw him carry a\n\nlight blue plastic bag, rectangular in shape and of a size slightly bigger than A4 paper\n\nsize, with a white string handle attached to it similar to that in P 12 which was found to\n\ncontain the drugs seized in the flat. But he could not remember if he saw any yellow\n\nborder on the blue plastic bag. He then instructed Sgt Tony Ng to relay a message to the\n\nothers that the driver was carrying a blue plastic bag. The driver walked towards the lift\n\nlanding of Block 489. After that he went inside the lift and the witness lost sight of\n\nhim. SSgt Goh denied that the accused walked to the end of Block 489 to ascertain the\n\nnumber of the block. About 1 to 2 minutes later, he heard a radio message that the driver\n\nwas standing outside #03-37.27.    The next\n\ntime SSgt Goh saw him was when he came out of the lift landing at Block 489. This time, he\n\nwas empty-handed. He went inside his car, reversed it and parked at another parking lot\n\nnear to Block 490. At about 2.55 p.m., he drove off from the car park of Block 490. Later\n\nat about 3.15 p.m., he heard on the radio set that the 1stand 2ndaccused were leaving the flat. On instructions, SSgt Goh together with Sgt Tony Ng\n\nproceeded to the lift landing of Block 489 to help arrest them.28.    After the\n\narrest at about 4.20 p.m., ASP Ang Choe Seng asked SSgt Goh to identify a blue plastic bag\n\nrecovered from unit #03-37. He positively identified the blue plastic bag seized as shown\n\nin P12 to be the one that the driver of JDF 755 was seen carrying earlier to the said\n\nunit. According to the witness, he only saw this blue bag twice, once when the driver of\n\nJDF 755 was carrying it and the second time when he was asked to identify it in the flat.Evidence of Sgt Tony Ng29.    Sgt Tony Ng\n\nwas with SSgt Goh Teck Hock. They arrived at the scene at about 1.30 p.m. Apart from\n\nkeeping watch on Salam who had been reported to him as being inside unit #03-37, they were\n\ntold to look out for Suboh. Sgt Tony Ng said that they were shown a photograph of Suboh\n\nprior to the surveillance on the 22ndDecember 1999.30.    At about\n\n2.05 p.m., Sgt Tony Ng saw Suboh alight from a taxi in front of Block 489 Jurong West St\n\n41. He wore a yellow T-shirt. He walked towards the lift landing of Block 489 and took a\n\nlift up. Later, Sgt Tony Ng heard a radio transmission to the effect that a Malaysian car\n\nhad arrived and entered the car park. The car number was given. At about 2.15 p.m., Sgt\n\nTony Ng saw car JDF 755 park in front of Block 489 Jurong West Street 41. His observation\n\npoint was at the edge of the void deck of Block 487 facing Block 489. It was a clear sunny\n\nday. He saw the driver alight from his vehicle and then move to the void deck. He was seen\n\nmaking calls on his handphone. He was attired in a grey like T-Shirt. Then he went back to\n\nhis car for a short while. The driver was next spotted at the lift landing of Block 489 at\n\nthe ground level. He entered the lift.31.    He failed to\n\nsee whether the driver was carrying anything in his hands before entering the lift because\n\nhe was not focusing on the driver at that point of time when he had to send a radio\n\nmessage given to him by his team leader, SSgt Goh, that the driver was carrying a blue\n\nplastic bag. Sgt Tony Ng therefore could not be sure whether the driver was or was not\n\ncarrying anything when he entered the lift. A short while later, he heard a radio message\n\nto the effect that the ‘Malaysian’ driver appeared at the 6thfloor.\n\nThere was another message that this person went down to the 3rdfloor.32.    Later, he\n\nsaw the driver emerge from the lift of Block 489. This time Sgt Tony Ng was positive that\n\nthe driver was not carrying anything as he walked back to his car. He then went into his\n\ncar and sat on the driver’s seat for a short while. This witness could not see what\n\nthe driver was doing. He later reversed and shifted his car to another parking lot. He\n\nremained in the car for quite some time before finally driving off.33.    It was\n\nsuggested twice to Sgt Tony Ng by counsel for the 3rdaccused that there was no\n\nradio message that the driver of the Malaysian car was on the 3rdlevel of\n\nBlock 489 to which the witness positively replied that there was.Evidence of Cpl Peter Loong34.    Cpl Peter\n\nLoong Tean Huat’s testified that he saw Suboh in a yellow round neck T-shirt at about\n\n2.05 p.m., alighting from a taxi in front of Block 489 Jurong West St 41. He saw him walk\n\nto the lift landing of the said block and take a lift up. Later, he heard on the radio set\n\nthat Suboh had entered unit #03-37.35.    At about 2.15 p.m.,\n\nhe saw a Malaysian registered motorcar JDF 755 driven by a male Chinese arrive at the car\n\npark of Block 489. He had been told earlier to look out for a Malaysian car coming into\n\nthe car park but was not told of its number plate.36.    Cpl Peter\n\nLoong next heard on the radio set that the car had parked. He substantially corroborated\n\nSgt Tony Ng’s evidence that it was later reported over the radio that the driver of\n\nJDF 755 was taking the lift up Block 489 carrying a blue plastic bag. It was also reported\n\nthrough the radio set that the driver was standing outside unit #03-37. At about 2.25\n\np.m., he heard another radio message that the driver was spotted walking back to his car\n\nempty-handed. At about 2.55 p.m., he saw JDF 755 leave the car park of Block 489 Jurong\n\nWest St 41 while he remained in the vicinity to keep watch on the unit #03-37. That was\n\nthe only Malaysian car he observed entering and leaving the car park entrance and exit\n\nbetween Block 491 and 490 during the period of his surveillance.37.    At about\n\n3.15 p.m., he heard on the radio set that Salam and Suboh left the unit. ASP Ang Choe Seng\n\nissued instructions on the radio set to arrest both of them. Cpl Loong then went to wait\n\nfor them at the ground floor lift landing of Block 489. Cpl Loong was injured when he\n\nhelped to arrest Suboh.Evidence of other CNB officers38.    SI Ronnie\n\nSee searched Suboh after his arrest and found five sachets of heroin and a key (see P18)\n\nin the right front pocket of his trousers, and another five sachets of heroin, a Motorola\n\npager, a Panasonic handphone, cash of $99 and a bunch of three keys (see P19) in the left\n\nfront pocket of his trousers. SI Ronnie See handed over the keys to SSgt Mahmud Bin Abu\n\nBakar who in turn handed them over to ASP Thomas Ng Boon Ho.39.    ASP Thomas\n\nNg used the bunch of 3 keys (see P19) recovered from the 2ndaccused to open\n\nthe padlock to the gate and the main door of the said unit #03-37. No one was in the flat.40.    In the\n\npresence of Salam and Suboh, SSgt Rosely Bin Sheron together with SSgt Mohamed Isa Bin\n\nKassim searched the kitchen, storeroom, master bedroom and front bedroom. On the kitchen\n\nsink (see P10) was a red plastic bag containing a cellophane wrapper and a stained plastic\n\npacket, which was partially torn open (see P20 and P21). This cellophane wrapper and\n\nplastic packet looked similar to the packing used for the five bundles of heroin in\n\nphotographs P13, 14 and 15. In the front bedroom, SSgt Rosely found a green plastic bag\n\n(see P11) behind the cupboard marked \"A\" in the sketch plan of the flat P26A,\n\nand at the location indicated by the arrow \"A\" in photographs P7 and P8. Inside\n\nit was a blue plastic bag (see P12) which contained the following:a. Five bundles of heroin in granular form\n\n  in a plastic bag, which was further wrapped in cellophane (Photographs P13, 14 and 15);b. A digital weighing scale (see P17);c. A red plastic bag (see P 16)\n\n  containing: -i. Five plastic spoonsii. Numerous empty plastic sachetsiii. A pencil and a roll of scotch tapeiv. A sachet of heroinv. Eleven sachets of heroin.41.    Seized from\n\nSalam were a Nokia handphone (not in a working condition), total cash of S$260.80cts and\n\nBrunei currency $11, including two pawnshop receipts evidencing the pledging of several\n\nitems of jewellery for a total sum of S$3,500.42.    At about\n\n4.25 p.m., SSgt Mohd Isa acted as an interpreter for the 2ndaccused when SI\n\nRonnie See recorded the following statement in his pocket book:SI Ronnie See : The heroin belongs to who?Accused B2 : I don’t know.SI Ronnie See : Who it belong to?Accused B2 : Don’t know.43.    At 7.20\n\np.m., urine samples were taken from both accused and sent to the Department of Scientific\n\nServices for analysis. To a question from counsel for Salam, ASP Fan confirmed that the\n\nSalam’s urine was tested positive for heroin.44.    Raids were\n\nconducted at the official addresses of the 1stand 2ndaccused at\n\nBlock 137 Yishun Ring Road #04-176 and Block 407 Clementi Avenue 1 #02-50 respectively for\n\ncontrolled drugs but nothing incriminating was found.45.    The\n\nfollowing items were seized from the 3rdaccused at the time of his arrest: the\n\nkey to car JDF 755 driven by him, his passport, a yellow Ericsson GF 768 handphone, a grey\n\nNokia 3210 handphone, cash of S$170 and MR840 and some other personal belongings.46.    The 3rdaccused was questioned shortly after his arrest in the Mandarin language by SSgt Ang Oon\n\nTho, who recorded the conversation in his pocket book (see P56) as follows:Q1: Is there anything inside your car?A1: MoneyQ2: How much money are there?A2: Thirty over thousand.Q3: Where all these money come from?A3: Borrow from my friend.Q4: Just now where are you?A4: I was at the 6thfloor corridor of Block 489 Jurong West.Q5: What are you doing there?A5: Wait for my friend known as ‘Tai Saw’.Q6: Thirty over thousand borrow from whom?A6: My friend call Tay Chee Siong stay at Block 422 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 bread shop.Q7: Is there any drug inside your vehicle?A7: No.47.    The above oral\n\nstatements were not challenged and were accordingly admitted into evidence.48.    The 3rdaccused’s car was searched. A brown envelope containing S$9,500 and another brown\n\nenvelope containing S$24,950 were found underneath the front passenger seat. Between the\n\ndriver seat and passenger seat were foundinter aliaa Nokia handphone battery,\n\nS$103.65 and MR63.20. The 3rdaccused admitted ownership of these items seized.49.    Counsel for\n\nthe 3rdaccused brought to my notice that the two brown envelopes containing\n\nthe large sums of money seized from the 3rdaccused were not tendered in court.\n\nI thus directed the learned DPP to call witnesses to establish what had happened to the\n\ntwo brown envelopes that were seized. Mr Matthew Lim Tow Thiam from the Financial\n\nInvestigations Department of CNB came to testify that he received two brown envelopes\n\ncontaining the cash from SSgt Ang Oon Tho. He took out the money, counted them in the\n\npresence of the 3rdaccused. Thereafter he kept the money, which was most\n\nimportant as far as he was concerned. Mr Matthew Lim did not return the two brown\n\nenvelopes to SSgt Ang. He could not recall if there was any writing on the envelope. He\n\ncould not remember what happened to the two brown envelopes, which were handed over to\n\nhim. Thus, the investigating officer, ASP Fan Tuck Chee (‘ASP Fan’), never saw\n\nthe two brown envelopes because they were never handed over to him at any time.Evidence of ASP Fan Tuck Chee50.    ASP Fan tendered the\n\npolaroid photographs P 104 to 106 showing the attire worn by the 3 accused persons on the\n\nday of their arrest. Clearly, there were blood stains on the T-Shirt of Suboh showing that\n\nthere was a considerable amount of bleeding apart from his blood stains on the wall where\n\nhe was leaning his head against as shown at photographs P 5 and P 6.51.    During\n\ncross-examination by counsel for the 3rdaccused, ASP Fan testified that the\n\nphone number 97991601 retrieved from the handphone seized from the 3rdaccused\n\nbelonged to a Singaporean named Amir Bin Sarif.52.    I admitted\n\ninto evidence the following oral statements from Suboh recorded in English by ASP Fan at\n\nabout 5.35 p.m. on 22 December 1999, after his counsel confirmed that he was not going to\n\nchallenge the voluntariness of the statements:Q1 : Where were you arrested?A1 : Downstairs.Q2 : Where were you before you were\n\n  arrested?A2 : Inside this house.Q3 : Who was arrested with you?A3 : ‘Salam’.Q4 : Who was with you inside this house\n\n  before you were arrested?A4 : ‘Salam’.Q5 : ‘Salam’ was inside this\n\n  house before you were arrested?A5 : Yes.Q6 : Who does this belong to?A6 : I don’t know.53.    When ASP Fan\n\nasked question 6, he pointed to the plastic bags containing the drugs recovered from\n\nbehind the cupboard of the bedroom. The questions and answers were recorded in English in\n\nhis field book (see P57a). They were read back to Suboh by ASP Fan. Suboh affirmed them to\n\nbe correct and he signed in the field book followed by ASP Fan. The recording ended at\n\nabout 5.45 p.m.Statements recorded under S122(6) CPC54.    As the Section\n\n122(6) statements of the 3 accused persons were not challenged, I admitted them into\n\nevidence.S 122(6) statement of 1staccused:The thing is not mine. I have nothing to\n\n  do with the house.S 122(6) statement of 2ndaccused:I have nothing to say right now.S 122(6) statement of 3rdaccused:I did not give the heroin to the two Malay\n\n  men. I only collected money from a Malay man whom I do not know.Statements of the 1stand 2ndaccused recorded under S 121 CPC55.    I also\n\nadmitted the S 121 CPC statements of Salam and Suboh which were not disputed. As both\n\nco-accused basically exonerated themselves but implicated the other, their statements must\n\nbe carefully scrutinised and tested against other objective evidence to determine which\n\nparts were likely to be false and which were likely to be true. As such, it is necessary\n\nto set them out in full. I reminded myself that section 30 of the Evidence Act concerning\n\nco-accused confessions was not applicable with respect to these two S 121 CPC statements.\n\nHence, I could not take into consideration any portions of the statements of one\n\nco-accused implicating the other co-accused as their statements were exculpatory of\n\nthemselves and did not qualify as confessions.56.    In his\n\nstatement recorded on 30 December 1999 at 11.20 a.m. at CNB, Salam said:1. I am also known as ‘Salam’ to\n\n  my friends.2. ……..(Deleted) ….3. Since my release from the prisons, I\n\n  had not been employed and was taking care of my aged mother. Only myself, my elder sister\n\n  and two elder brothers are staying with my mother. I am the youngest child in a family of\n\n  eleven children.4. On the day that I was arrested, I was\n\n  at home in the morning and I woke up at about 8.00 a.m. or 9.00 a.m. Before taking my\n\n  breakfast at the market, I tried calling ‘Joe’ but could not get through. After\n\n  my breakfast, I tried calling ‘Joe’ at the public phone on the ground floor of\n\n  my block of flat to ask for his help. I wanted him to introduce work to me.\n\n  ‘Joe’ told me that he has work to do and asked me to go to Blk 489 Jurong West\n\n  Ave 1. ‘Joe’ said that he will be at Jurong West after 1.00 p.m. and also gave\n\n  me directions to the unit. He told me that at Blk 489 Jurong West, I am to go up to the 3rdstorey using the staircase which does not have a lift. He also told me that he would be in\n\n  the first house that I came to if I were to turn right after going up the stairs.\n\n  Immediately, I took a taxi to Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.5. I am now shown a photograph of a male\n\n  Malay whom I recognised as ‘Joe\" (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown a\n\n  photograph of Suboh Bin Ramli, IC: S7730598-Z whom he identified as ‘Joe’\n\n  mentioned in his statement). I am now shown another photograph of a male Chinese whom I do\n\n  not know. I have never seen him before (Recorder’s note:- Accused is shown a\n\n  photograph of Wong Kok Loong, IC: A3391382 (FOM) whom he claimed not to know).6. At about 1 plus in the afternoon, I\n\n  reached Blk 489 Jurong West and alighted along the main road. I then walked to Blk 489 and\n\n  took the lift to the 6thstorey, after which I walked down the stairs to the 3rdstorey. I knocked on the door but there was no response. I then went back to the 7thstorey by the stairs and waited there for a while. After about 15 to 20 minutes, I went\n\n  back to the house at the 3rdstorey and knocked on the door again.\n\n  ‘Joe’ opened the door and told me that he has work to do. He asked me to go back\n\n  to the 7thstorey and told me that he will come up to look for me after he has\n\n  finished his work. I do not know what work he was referring to. After a while,\n\n  ‘Joe’ came up to the 6thstorey and whistled for me to join him. I\n\n  then walked with him to the lift and he invited me to have lunch with him. We went to the\n\n  ground floor using the lift and after coming out from the lift, a few men arrested us. I\n\n  squatted down and was handcuffed. At the same time, I noticed ‘Joe’ running away\n\n  towards the carpark but was stopped and he struggled with the men arresting him. I knew\n\n  that the men were CNB officers.7. ‘Joe’ and myself were later\n\n  brought up to the house at the 3rdstorey, the one that I had been to earlier.\n\n  We were brought to the hall and I remember being asked something like ‘where’s\n\n  the thing’. I kept quiet and when asked again, I replied that I do not know. However,\n\n  I overhead an officer asking ‘Joe’ the same question and ‘Joe’\n\n  replying that it was already given to someone. The rooms were then searched in our\n\n  presence and in the room nearer to the corridor, a Malay officer found a blue plastic bag\n\n  from behind the cupboard and showed us the contents. I saw that there 5 big packets and\n\n  some small packets of heroin in the plastic bag. I also saw a digital scale and a lot of\n\n  empty small plastic bags. After which, ‘Joe’; and myself were asked to wait in\n\n  the hall.8. About one hour or so later, the officer\n\n  in charge of the case asked me whether I know who the drugs belong to. I replied that I do\n\n  not know. I was then put back at the hall and a while later, some men came to take\n\n  photographs of the heroin. After finish taking the photographs, I was brought to the CNB\n\n  office for urine test. At the CNB office, I saw ‘Joe’. I was told by an officer\n\n  that my urine tested positive of heroin and asked if I had smoked heroin. I told him that\n\n  I did not smoke heroin but I did consume cough mixture and panadol because I was sick. I\n\n  did not see a doctor as it was not serious. A childhood friend of mine whom I do not have\n\n  the contact number of gave me a bottle of cough mixture. I do not know why my urine was\n\n  tested positive and I believe that it is because of the cough mixture.9. After the urine test, I was brought to\n\n  another CNB office where the heroin was weighed in the presence of ‘Joe’, myself\n\n  and another male Chinese. Then, the officers brought to my home at Blk 137 Yishun Ring\n\n  Road #04-176. A search was conducted but nothing was found. I was then brought to the\n\n  hospital for a medical check-up and later brought back to the CNB office where my\n\n  statement was recorded. After the statement, I was again brought to the hospital for\n\n  another check-up and thereafter referred to the lock-up at CID.10. I am now asked who the heroin that was\n\n  recovered in the house at Blk 489 Jurong West belongs to. I wish to say that I do not know\n\n  but I think that ‘Joe’ will know because he was in the house before I reached\n\n  there.Further statement of Abdul Salam Bin\n\n  Musthafa, IC: S7002309-A – recorded on 30.12.00 at 3.10 p.m. in CNB MIB room #01-04.11. My previous statement recorded on\n\n  30.12.99 was read back to me in Malay and I affirm it to be true and correct.12. I first met ‘Joe’ in Changi\n\n  Prison sometime in 1996 or 1997. I am not close to ‘Joe’ although I was in the\n\n  same hall with him when I was serving my sentence in Changi Prison. In November 1999, I\n\n  met up with ‘Joe’ again by chance along Orchard Road. ‘Joe’ asked me\n\n  if I had any pager or handphone but I did not have any. ‘Joe’ then gave me his\n\n  handphone contact number. One or two weeks later, I went to Orchard Road and contacted\n\n  ‘Joe’ as he always hangs out there. We just met up for a meal and I returned\n\n  home as I was still under police supervision.13. Since then, I have not met nor\n\n  contacted ‘Joe’ until a day before we were arrested when I called him on his\n\n  handphone. I wanted to meet ‘Joe’ with the intention of asking him for contacts\n\n  whom could provide me with work as I needed money for the coming Hari Raya celebration.\n\n  ‘Joe’ then asked me to contact him again the next day. That was why I called\n\n  ‘Joe’ in the morning on the day which I was arrested.14. Since I was released from prison in\n\n  October 1999, I have not been working but I supported myself using money which I obtaining\n\n  from pawning off jewellery of mine. I bought the jewellery before I was detained in\n\n  prison. When I was first released from prisons, I managed to get by as my mother, brothers\n\n  and sisters gave me money to spend. However, as the money that they gave me was not enough\n\n  to support my drinking at pubs, I pawned off my jewellery and obtained S$3,500/-. This\n\n  amount of money saw me through from November 1999 till when I was arrested in December\n\n  1999.15. I am now shown a bunch of three keys\n\n  and I wish to say that I have not seen them before (Recorder’s note:- Accused is\n\n  shown a bunch of three keys labelled as ‘C-1’ which were seized on the day of\n\n  arrest and were used to gain entry to Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37). I also wish to\n\n  say again that I have never entered into the house at the 3rdstorey of Blk 489\n\n  Jurong West and that was the first time that I had been there. I also do not know who the\n\n  house belongs to. I only know that ‘Joe’ stays somewhere in Clementi. I do not\n\n  know whether ‘Joe’ was at Jurong West before or after I arrived as nobody\n\n  answered the door when I knocked on it for about a minute the first time. I think that my\n\n  knocking was quite soft and maybe ‘Joe’ did not hear me. The second time, when I\n\n  went back to the house, I knocked on the door similarly but for a little longer and\n\n  ‘Joe’ opened the door.16. As to the heroin that was found in the\n\n  house at Blk 489 Jurong West, I do not know who it belongs to but it may belong to\n\n  ‘Joe’ because ‘Joe’ was in the house and he was also found with heroin\n\n  in him. Moreover, I remembered ‘Joe’ saying to a CNB officer that he had given\n\n  ‘things’ to someone else.57.    Suboh gave the\n\nfollowing version of the events in his Section 121 statements recorded at CNB on 28\n\nDecember 1999 at 3.30 p.m.:I am also known as ‘Joe’\n\n  to my friends but ‘Suboh’ to my family.2. ….(Deleted) ….3. On 22.12.99, the morning on which I was\n\n  arrested, I was at my friend’s house at Bukit Batok Central. I had stayed at the\n\n  house of ‘Ali’ the night before. At about 12 plus in the afternoon, I woke up\n\n  and went back to my house at Blk 407 Clementi Ave 1 #02-50. I reached home at about 1.00\n\n  p.m. At about 1 plus in the afternoon, my friend ‘Salam’ called me on my\n\n  handphone and asked me to go to the 3rdstorey of Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.\n\n  ‘Salam’ also told me that when I reached the 3rdstorey, I was to\n\n  whistle and he would open the door for me. I do not know the unit which ‘Salam’\n\n  wanted me to go to. Over the phone, ‘Salam also asked me if I wanted to help me sell\n\n  VCDs but I do not know why ‘Salam’ asked me to go to that house. I also did not\n\n  ask why he wanted to meet me in the house at Jurong West.4. After receiving the call from\n\n  ‘Salam’, I changed my clothes and left for Jurong West in a taxi. At about 15\n\n  minutes later, I arrived at Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1. After alighting from the taxi at\n\n  the carpark, I took the lift up to the 6thstorey of the flat. I then walked\n\n  down to the 3rdstorey and at the corridor, I whistled. I then saw\n\n  ‘Salam’ open the door to one of the houses. I went into the house and noticed\n\n  that it was very messy. This is the first time that I had been to this house and I do not\n\n  know whom the house belonged to. ‘Salam’ was alone in the house. After a while,\n\n  when I asked ‘Salam’ where is the VCD, ‘Salam’ showed me a plastic bag\n\n  containing more than ten sachets of drugs which was place on the floor in the living room.\n\n  The drugs that I was referring to is heroin. More than twenty VCDs were also placed on top\n\n  of the heroin. I could not remember the colour of the plastic bag. ‘Salam’ also\n\n  told me that on that same day, someone handed to him many VCDs in a plastic bag but he was\n\n  surprised to find that there was also heroin in the plastic bag. I wanted to take some of\n\n  the heroin that ‘Salam’ showed me for my own consumption but ‘Salam’\n\n  did not allow me. However, I did not listen to ‘Salam’ and took about ten\n\n  sachets of heroin from the plastic bag. I then kept five sachets of the heroin in each of\n\n  my front trousers pocket. ‘Salam’ scolded me but I told me that I was under\n\n  stress and I was already consuming cannabis and ‘ecstacy’ and I might as well\n\n  consume heroin.5. I am now shown a photograph of a male\n\n  Malay whom I recognised as the ‘Salam’ whom I was referring to in my statement\n\n  (Recorder’s note :- Accused was shown a photograph of Abdul Salam Bin Musthafa, IC :\n\n  S7002309-A whom he identified as the ‘Salam’ he mentioned in his statement). I\n\n  was also shown another photograph of a male Chinese whom I had never seen before and could\n\n  not recognise meeting before (Recorder’s note :- Accused is also shown a photograph\n\n  of Wong Kok Loong, IC: A3391382 (FOM) whom he claimed not to have met before).6. After, I had placed the ten sachets of\n\n  heroin into my pockets, I went to the toilet. I did not ask ‘Salam’ anything\n\n  more about the VCD. After which, I left the house with ‘Salam’. When we left the\n\n  house, ‘Salam’ opened the padlock to the gate and left the key in the lock\n\n  itself. I was the one who closed the door and padlocked the gate. I had wanted to pass\n\n  ‘Salam’ keys to him but as he was already walking up the stairs, I put the keys\n\n  in my trousers pocket. My intention then was to return to my home in Clementi. We went up\n\n  to the 6thstorey again to take the lift down to the ground floor. After we\n\n  came out from the lift at the ground floor, many men approached us and placed us under\n\n  arrest. There was a struggle as I did not know why I was arrested and also did not know\n\n  who the men were initially. I got to know that they were CNB officers later. I also knew\n\n  that myself and a officer were injured during the struggle. I noticed that\n\n  ‘Salam’ was also arrested. A search was conducted on me and the heroin that I\n\n  had earlier taken was found in my trousers pockets. The keys to the house at the 3rdstorey was also found in my pocket. ‘Salam’ and myself were then brought to the\n\n  house at the 3rdstorey.7. In the house, a search was conducted in\n\n  the presence of ‘Salam’ and myself. My head was aching then from the injury and\n\n  I was not concentrating during the search. After a while, the officers brought me to the\n\n  living room and I saw a few packets of heroin. I was then asked who the heroin belongs to\n\n  and I replied that I do not know. Some time later, photographs of the house and the heroin\n\n  were taken. I was later brought to a place where my urine was taken and tested.\n\n  …… After which, I was brought to another office where the drugs recovered was\n\n  weighed in front of myself, ‘Salam’ and an unknown Chinese male. Thereafter, I\n\n  was brought to my house at Blk 407 Clement Ave 1 #02-50 where a search was conducted.\n\n  Nothing was found there. The officers and myself then left my house and went to Alexandra\n\n  Hospital where a doctor examined me. After the medical check, I was brought back to a CNB\n\n  office where a charge was read to me and my statement was also recorded. I was then\n\n  brought back to Alexandra Hospital and another check was done on me. After the medical\n\n  examination, I was brought to the lock-up at CID.Further statement of Suboh Bin\n\n  Ramli, IC: S7730598-Z recorded on 29.12.99 at 2.45 p.m. in CNB MIB room #01-048. My previous statement recorded on\n\n  28.12.99 was read back to me in Malay and I affirm it to be true and correct.9. ….(Deleted) …..10. The last time that I smoked heroin was\n\n  sometime in 1991 or 1992. Since then, I had never smoked heroin. On the day that I was\n\n  arrested, I took ten sachets of heroin from ‘Salam’ as the heroin was readily\n\n  available and I did not need to pay any money for it. ‘Salam’ also did not\n\n  object to me taking the heroin. I do not know how long the ten sachets of heroin could\n\n  last me as I am not a heavy heroin user. I also do not know whether I could finish using\n\n  the heroin which I took. I thought of trying to smoke heroin to relieve my stress.11. I got to know ‘Salam’ in\n\n  1996 when I was in Changi Prisons as we were inside the same hall. After I was released in\n\n  May 1999, I did not contact ‘Salam’. Sometime in November 1999, I met\n\n  ‘Salam’ again at Orchard Road and he asked for my contact number. I then gave\n\n  him my handphone number 98165351 but he did not give me his contact number in return.\n\n  Since then, ‘Salam’ had only contacted me about two or three times and talked\n\n  only about casual topics. I had only been out with ‘Salam’ only once as he was\n\n  under probation and could not go out at night. ‘Salam’ seldom contacts me and\n\n  therefore I do not know much about him. I only know that he stays in Yishun or Ang Mo Kio\n\n  and nothing more.12. I do not have a permanent job since I\n\n  was released from prisons in May 1999 and I have been working as an odd-job labourer since\n\n  then. I could not estimate my earnings but it is not more than S$2,000/- per month. I\n\n  seldom ask my family for money but occasionally, I will ask about S$20/- or S$30/- from my\n\n  mother. Often, I will also give my mother about S$30/- to S$50/- as spending money. I\n\n  spend most of my money on cigarettes and do not have any savings. Often, I will meet up\n\n  with my old friends for soccer games and visiting nightspots.13. About the heroin recovered in the\n\n  house at Jurong West Ave 1, I have no idea who the drugs belongs to. It is definitely not\n\n  mine. I also do not know whether it belongs to ‘Salam’. During the time when\n\n  myself and ‘Salam’ were inside the house at Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1, I did not\n\n  see anybody else inside the house and I had not been into any of the rooms before. While I\n\n  was in the living room with ‘Salam’, I did not see him going into any of the\n\n  rooms. As mentioned in paragraph 4 and paragraph 6 in my earlier statement, after I took\n\n  the ten sachets of heroin from the plastic bag which ‘Salam’ had shown me, I\n\n  went to the toilet. Before I went to the toilet, the plastic bag with the heroin was still\n\n  on the floor in the living room. However, I did not notice where the plastic bag was after\n\n  I came out from the toilet. ‘Salam’ did not go to the kitchen or the toilet with\n\n  me. He was still at the living room when I came out from the toilet. Nobody ever entered\n\n  or left the house while I was in there with ‘Salam’.Evidence of occupiers of the flat58.    As the drugs were\n\nfound in a flat belonging to persons other than the accused persons, the CNB officers\n\nnaturally conducted investigations on the owners of the flats. Statements were recorded\n\nfrom them. They were also called by the prosecution to testify that they were not involved\n\nwith the drugs found in the flat. Defence counsel therefore had the opportunity to\n\ncross-examine them. However, none of the counsel put to them or even suggested to them\n\nthat the drugs belonged to them. Accordingly, I ruled out their involvement with the drugs\n\nat this trial. But for completeness, I would set out their evidence.59.    The\n\nregistered owners of the flat at Block 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37 are Hazlie Bin\n\nBolwahab (‘Hazlie’) and his wife, Sarimah Binte Rahmat (‘Sarimah’).\n\nThey are now staying with their son at Hazlie’s parents’ flat at Block 517A\n\nJurong West Street 52 #13-555. The flat at Block 489 was originally purchased by\n\nHazlie’s parents from HDB sometime in 1984. Hazlie (2ndson in the family\n\nof 4 sons) and his three brothers stayed in this flat together with their parents. When\n\nHazlie got married in December 1997, his wife shifted into Block 489. Later in December\n\n1998, Hazlie’s father bought the flat at Block 517A and sold the flat at Block 489 to\n\nHazlie and his wife on 1 January 1999. All of the occupants of the flat at Block 489\n\nincluding Hazlie and his wife shifted to the flat at Block 517A except Hazlie’s\n\nyoungest brother and his wife. Hazlie said that he had never been back to stay at Block\n\n489 since he shifted out. But he had occasionally returned to the flat to collect\n\nmiscellaneous items and clothing that he had left in the flat and to collect mail from the\n\nletterbox. The last time he visited the flat was in October 1999 when he shifted his\n\nbedroom set out to the present flat where he is staying. His father and third brother\n\nHazani have been to the flat on separate occasions in December 1999 to take the blender\n\nand his motorcycle helmet respectively.60.    According to\n\nSarimah, all of the occupants of Block 489 shifted to Block 517A in December 1998. There\n\nwas some discrepancy with the evidence of Hazlie that his youngest brother, Hazafi Bin\n\nDolwahab, and his wife remained in Block 489 when the rest moved out. Hazlie and Sarimah\n\nsaid that they have never made duplicate keys to the flat nor have they given the keys to\n\nthe flat to anybody. Neither have they lost the keys to the flat. According to them, they\n\nshare one set of keys to the flat at Block 489.61.    The eldest son in\n\nthe family is Hazral Bin Dolwahab. He is single and employed as a supervisor at Citicab.\n\nThe last time he went back to the flat was in September or October 1999 when he retrieved\n\nhis remaining clothes left at the flat, to which he has a set of keys given to him by his\n\nfather. He confirmed that he did not lose any of the keys nor had he duplicated them or\n\nlent them to anybody.62.    The third\n\nson is Hazani Bin Dolwahab. He is single and employed as a customer service officer with\n\nSmart Voice. He still keeps the key to the flat at Block 489 as some of his personal\n\nbelongings are kept there. He has not lent nor passed the keys to the flat to anybody. The\n\nlast occasion he visited the flat was about a week before the raid by CNB officers when he\n\nwent to collect a motorcycle helmet from the flat. He remembered locking the flat before\n\nleaving.63.    Hazafi Bin\n\nDolwahab (‘Hazafi’) is the youngest son. He said that he is known as ‘Ah\n\nPit’. He had met Suboh in the Reformative Training Centre in 1995 and in Changi\n\nPrison in 1996. After Hazafi was released from prison, Suboh had met up with him for a\n\ndrink at a coffee shop in Haig Road. Suboh had also visited him on three occasions in 1998\n\nat his flat at Block 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37 before he and his family shifted out to\n\ntheir present 5 room flat at Block 517A Jurong West Street 52 #13-555 in December 1998.\n\nHazafi maintained that he had never given Suboh the keys to his flat at Block 489 and\n\nneither had he lost nor duplicated the keys to the said flat. He said that he had never\n\nbeen back to that flat after moving out. Counsel for Suboh put to Hazafi that he had known\n\nSalam in Changi Prison in 1996 and had kept in touch after their release and that he had\n\ngiven the keys to his flat at Block 489 to Salam. However, Hazafi maintained that he has\n\nnever met Salam.64.    Dolwahab Bin Dron,\n\n51 years of age, is the father of the four sons mentioned above. He said that he is now\n\nstaying with his wife and three of his sons, his daughter-in-law and grandson in the flat\n\nat Block 517A. However, his other son Hazafi Bin Dolwahab (i.e. ‘Ah Pit’) has\n\nshifted to Choa Chu Kang since he got married. He said that every son has a set of keys to\n\nthe flat. He sold the flat at Block 489 to Hazlie and his wife but they do not stay there.\n\nInstead, Hazlie’s family lives with him. His wife takes care of their grandson.\n\nDolwahab said that Hazlie has not rented the flat to anybody. The last occasion he visited\n\nthe flat was about 2 weeks before the raid. He went there to collect his wife’s\n\npotato blender that was left in the flat. The door was always locked when he visited the\n\nflat to retrieve his things from the flat.65.    After\n\nreviewing their evidence at this stage of the trial, my observation was that unless one of\n\nthem had lost the key or given the key to the 1stor 2ndaccused, it\n\nwas unlikely for the 1stand 2ndaccused to gain access to the flat\n\nwith the keys that could open the padlock and the door lock. These two locks had not been\n\nchanged and the family of Dolwahab apparently could still enter the flat with their\n\noriginal keys. So it was not the case that the 1stor 2ndaccused\n\nhad broken into the flat and then re-installed new locks for their own access to the\n\nexclusion of the Dolwahab family.66.    As the\n\nyoungest son, ‘Ah Pit’, knew Suboh apparently quite well having invited him to\n\nthe flat on three previous occasions, it was more likely in my view for Suboh to be given\n\nthe keys to the said flat by ‘Ah Pit’. It was not likely for Salam to be in\n\npossession of the keys to the flat as ‘Ah Pit’ had confirmed that he did not\n\nknow Salam.67.    At this stage of the\n\ntrial, my assessment of the evidence was limited to that required by the Haw Tua Tau test\n\nto determine if their defence ought to be called.Drug Analysis68.    The drugs contained\n\nin the red plastic bag taken from the blue plastic bag (see P12) were sent to the\n\nDepartment of Scientific Services for analysis. The 5 packets and 12 sachets were analysed\n\nto contain not less than 165.67 grams of diamorphine. Of the five plastic spoons in the\n\nred plastic bag, three were found stained with diamorphine. In the red plastic bag (see\n\nP16) were several empty small plastic bags similar to those used to pack the drugs into\n\nsachets.69.    The 10\n\nsachets found on the 2ndaccused at the time of his arrest was analysed to\n\ncontain not less that 6.16 grams of diamorphine.Voire dire of 1staccused70.    Dr Yeo Kim\n\nHai examined Salam, the 1staccused, at 0140 hours on 23 December 1999 at\n\nAlexandra Hospital. He found bruises at Salam’s right temple, right cheek and the\n\nright side of the nose. There was a small laceration on the right jaw.71.    Sgt Tony Ng\n\nand W/Sgt Rahizah testified that they waited outside the ground floor lift landing of\n\nBlock 489 to arrest Salam. After identifying themselves, they grabbed the arms of Salam.\n\nWhen Salam refused to go down upon being told to do so by W/Sgt Rahizah in Malay, Sgt Tony\n\nNg said he tackled the right leg of Salam with his left leg to bring him down to his\n\nknees. Both CNB officers then forcefully pushed him down to the prone position, pinned him\n\ndown and handcuffed his hands behind his back. W/Sgt Rahizah testified that the right side\n\nof Salam’s face was in contact with the ground after he was pushed down. It was in\n\nthat position that they handcuffed him.72.    Sgt Tony Ng\n\nthen placed Salam inside a CNB staff car. He did not see SSgt Subramaniam come near Salam\n\nwhen he was guarding him. Thus, he never saw SSgt Subramaniam assault him at all. SSgt\n\nSubramaniam also denied assaulting him.73.    Salam\n\ntestified that he did not resist his arrest nor put up any struggle. Since there was no\n\nstruggle, the injuries found on him were not the result of his arrest. They were inflicted\n\nby the CNB officers. He asserted that he was kicked at his lower right jaw and punched on\n\nthe right side of his face by SSgt Subramanian whilst he was bending down to enter the CNB\n\nstaff car through the right rear passenger door. Then he was pushed into the car by SSgt\n\nSubramaniam. He was questioned about a ‘key’. SSgt Subramanian punched again,\n\nthis time on the right side of his forehead. These assaults caused him to be fearful of\n\nthe CNB officers who subsequently brought him up to unit #03-37 on 22 December 1999 to\n\nquestion him. He did not complain of the assaults to the doctor who examined him prior to\n\nand after the recording of his cautioned statements because the escorting CNB officer was\n\npresent.74.    Counsel submitted\n\nthat his oral statements given on 22 December 1999 to SI Ronnie See and ASP Fan whilst in\n\nthe flat were involuntary because he feared that he would be further assaulted if he did\n\nnot answer the questions posed to him.75.    The\n\nprosecution submitted that the bruises and laceration on the right side of his face were\n\nsustained during his arrest when he was pushed down to the ground by Sgt Tony Ng and W/Sgt\n\nRahizah. When he was pinned down, the right side of his face was in fact in contact with\n\nthe ground.76.    I disbelieved\n\nSalam’s allegation that he was assaulted. I failed to see how he could have been\n\nkicked and punched by SSgt Subramaniaum as he was bending down to enter the CNB car. There\n\nwas simply not enough room between the right door and the accused for SSgt Subramaniaum,\n\nwhilst holding the accused’s shoulder, to raise his right foot to inflict the kick on\n\nthe accused’s right jaw and punch him just below the right eye as he was bending down\n\nand was about to enter the right side of the rear passenger seat.77.    Salam’s\n\nevidence that he voluntarily laid down prone on the ground on the instructions of the\n\narresting officers without the officers even touching him prior to his being handcuffed,\n\nwas simply unbelievable. I accepted the arresting officers’ account of the arrest.\n\nThe injuries in my judgment were caused when he was tackled and pushed forcefully down to\n\nthe prone position in the course of which the right side of his face and jaw had hit and\n\nrubbed against the rough ground, and injuries were thereby sustained. The injuries found\n\nwere linear as reflected in the medical notes of Dr Ganesan whereas injuries caused by\n\npunches according to Dr Ganesan would be more diffused in pattern. Hence, Dr Ganesan was\n\nof the view that the injuries found on Salam’s face were more consistent with\n\ninjuries associated with the manner of arrest as described by the CNB officers than with\n\nthe accused being kicked and punched as alleged by him. Dr Ganesan further testified that\n\nhe would have noted it down if Salam had complained of any assault. However, there was no\n\nsuch record in his medical notes.78.    After\n\nevaluating all the evidence at the 1staccused’s voire dire, I found that\n\nthe prosecution had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that all the oral statements were\n\ngiven voluntarily by the 1staccused. No threats, inducements or promises were\n\nmade to him to obtain the oral statements. Neither was he assaulted. Accordingly, I ruled\n\nthat the oral statements sought to be admitted by the prosecution were admissible.Voire dire of 2ndaccused79.    The CNB\n\nofficers involved with the arrest of the 2ndaccused at the vicinity of the\n\nlift landing on the ground floor of Block 489 were principally SSgt Goh Teck Hock, Sgt\n\nTony Ng, Cpl Peter Loong and SSgt Subramaniam. The other officers who assisted were SI\n\nRonnie See Su Khoon, SSgt Mohamed Isa Bin Kassim and Sgt Deen Goh Teck Kiat.80.    Suboh tried\n\ndesperately to escape from the arresting officers. Considerable force had to be used to\n\nsecure his arrest by tackling him to the ground. He was pinned face downwards before the\n\nofficers finally handcuffed him behind his back. In the process, the accused sustained\n\ninjuries. So did Cpl Peter Loong who dislocated his left shoulder when he gave Suboh a\n\nrugby tackle from the rear left side of the accused’s body as the accused was running\n\naway. This resulted in both of them falling hard on to the cement floor with Suboh landing\n\non top of Cpl Peter Loong’s left shoulder. When Cpl Peter Loong fell on his back,\n\nSuboh also fell on his back but landed on top of Cpl Loong. Cpl Peter Loong basically\n\ncushioned the fall of Suboh. I observed that Cpl Peter Loong did not suffer any injury to\n\nthe back of his head during this fall although his head would be nearer the ground. It was\n\nunlikely for Suboh to injure the back of his head since he landed on top of Cpl Peter\n\nLoong. Then what explanation could there be for the linear laceration measuring 2 cm at\n\nthe back of Suboh’s head?81.    After this\n\nfall, Suboh got up and tried to escape again. He was subsequently caught and pinned to the\n\nground face downwards at the adjacent grass verge not too far from the lift landing at\n\nBlock 489 by SSgt Subramaniam and SSgt Goh Teck Hock. He was subsequently handcuffed. I\n\nnoted that Suboh never fell on his back again.82.    The 2ndaccused alleged that he was hit on the back of his head with handcuffs, kicked on the left\n\nback, punched on his left cheek just before he was handcuffed at the grass verge. He also\n\nclaimed that SSgt Mohamed Isa and Cpl Goh San had kicked him hard on his right chest and\n\nabdominal area whilst he was seated cross-legged on the floor in the hall of the flat to\n\nwhich he was brought after his arrest. They wanted to avenge the injury sustained by Cpl\n\nPeter Loong. According to Suboh, the kicks were painful. However, the officers denied\n\nkicking him. I did not believe that Suboh was kicked at all after his arrest as the\n\nmedical examination did not reveal injuries consistent with the alleged kicks. This\n\naffected Suboh’s credibility somewhat for this voire dire only.83.    The\n\narresting officers denied hitting him at the back of his head with their handcuffs. They\n\nmaintained that the head laceration must have been accidentally sustained during the fall\n\nwhen Cpl Peter Loong gave him a rugby tackle to bring him down. The demonstration in court\n\nby the CNB officers reinforced my opinion that it was not likely for that fall to have\n\ncaused a single clean deep linear laceration at the back of the accused’s head. If\n\nso, then I would be left with the accused’s assertion that the arresting officers had\n\nhit his head with their handcuffs in the course of his arrest, which I did not find\n\nimprobable, although the accused would not really be in a position to see who and what had\n\nactually hit him when he was lying prone face downwards on the grass verge at Block 489\n\nand pinned down before being handcuffed.84.    The fact\n\nthat Suboh sustained some injuries was not disputed as Dr Leong Hoe Nam examined him at\n\n2230 hours on the 22 December 1999, and found a linear bruise of 3 cm on his left eye, a\n\nfairly deep linear laceration of 2 cm involving the scalp layer at the back of his head on\n\nthe left side, a semicircular erythema measuring 3 cm on his anterior right chest and\n\nthree linear erythema on the back. Dr Leong testified that the linear laceration at the\n\nhead would have significant bleeding. He stitched up the open wound. Apart from it being\n\nconsistent with the head hitting the ground during a fall, Dr Leong agreed that the linear\n\nlaceration at the back of the head would also be consistent with a blow of great force by\n\nsomething blunt like a pair of handcuffs. It might cause great pain initially but the pain\n\nwould subsequently subside. Dr Leong however disagreed that the small 3 cm semicircular\n\nerythema on the chest was consistent with a kick on the foot by a person wearing shoes. If\n\nit were a kick as described, he would expect a larger and broader area of injury. But this\n\n3 cm semicircular line erythema had no width. I accepted the reasons put forth by Dr Leong\n\non this. Suboh was obviously lying that he had been kicked hard on his right chest.85.    As these\n\nassaults were not the basis for challenging the voluntariness of his statements, it is not\n\nnecessary for me to go into more detail on how these injuries could have been sustained,\n\nand whether they had caused Suboh’s oral statements to SI Ronnie See on 22 December\n\n1999 at about 4.15 p.m. in the flat to be involuntary. The relevance of ascertaining the\n\nlikely cause of the deep linear laceration to the back of the 2ndaccused’s head was to weigh and test the credibility of Suboh and the relevant\n\narresting officers as witnesses of fact. On this part of the evidence, I found that Suboh\n\nwas more credible in his testimony.86.    I accepted\n\nSuboh’s evidence that the laceration at the back of his head was painful and that\n\nthere was substantial bleeding, which had smeared part of the wall of the flat against\n\nwhich he was resting for some time after his arrest. The polaroid photograph of him taken\n\nby the CNB shortly after his arrest showed that there were blood stains at the front of\n\nhis shirt and shirt collar. I believed that he did ask for medical attention. SSgt Mohamed\n\nIsa testified that Suboh was moaning in pain while he was in the flat. He told Suboh to\n\nbear the pain, and that he would be sent for medical treatment later. When asked whether\n\nSuboh was groaning in pain before or after SI Ronnie See asked the questions, SSgt Mohamed\n\nIsa said he could not recall. SSgt Mohamed Isa remembered however that Suboh had asked to\n\ngo to the hospital although he could not recall whether that request was made before or\n\nafter SI Ronnie See had asked the questions. Counsel submitted that the refusal of medical\n\nattention in the face of the severe pain amounted to oppression which sapped his will and\n\nled to his giving the oral statements.87.    I took cognisance of\n\nthe fact that Suboh refused to sign SI Ronnie See’s pocket book on which SI Ronnie\n\nSee had recorded the oral statements despite being invited to do so. Suboh testified that\n\nhe did not sign because his statements were not given voluntarily and they had not kept\n\ntheir promise to send him to the hospital immediately after he had answered the questions.\n\nIt was submitted that Suboh would surely have signed the pocket book if he had given his\n\nanswers voluntarily but he did not.88.    Suboh\n\nadditionally challenged the voluntariness of his oral statements recorded by SI Ronnie See\n\non the basis that he was induced to make those statements. He testified that he had made\n\nrepeated requests both in English and Malay to be sent to the hospital. He asked SI Ronnie\n\nSee to send him for medical treatment for the injury sustained at the back of his head to\n\nwhich SI Ronnie See replied that he would do so if Suboh were to answer his questions\n\nfirst. Suboh testified that SI Ronnie See kept repeating the fact that unless he gave him\n\nanswers, he would not be brought to the hospital. He believed what SI Ronnie See told him.\n\nThat led him to give the answers to SI Ronnie See. Before that, Suboh said he refused to\n\nanswer the questions posed by SI Ronnie See.89.    SI Ronnie\n\nSee however testified that Suboh had never asked to be sent for medical treatment. I did\n\nnot believe him.90.    Having\n\nregard to the totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had not proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt that the oral statements were given voluntarily without being induced to\n\ndo so as alleged by the 2ndaccused. Accordingly, I did not allow the 2ndaccused’s oral statements recorded by SI Ronnie See to be admitted into evidence.Voire dire of 3rdaccused91.    The\n\nprosecution sought to admit the section 121 statements of the 3rdaccused\n\nrecorded by ASP Fan with the assistance of the interpreter, Mr Wu Nan Yong, on 23 December\n\n1999 from 3.50 p.m. to 5.30 p.m. (1ststatement ), and on 27 December 1999 from\n\n11.20 p.m. to 4.15 p.m. (2ndstatement) at CNB.92.    The 3rdaccused challenged the admissibility of the 1ststatement on the basis that ASP\n\nFan threatened to assault him and at the same time, offered him an inducement. With regard\n\nto the 2ndstatement, he was induced by ASP Fan to give it.93.    I will first\n\nset out the evidence of the CNB officers on the arrest of the 3rdaccused. SSgt\n\nYon Boon Ngiap and Cpl Abdullah Mohamed followed the 3rdaccused’s car JDF\n\n755 on their motorcycle after it left the car park at Block 489 Jurong West Street 41. At\n\nthe traffic light junction of Upper Thomson Road and Marymount Lane, they stopped the\n\nlorry in front of the 3rdaccused’s car. Then SSgt Yon proceeded to the\n\nfront passenger side of vehicle JDF 755 taking his crash helmet with him. Cpl Abdullah\n\nwent to the driver’s side of the car.94.    Meanwhile,\n\nSenior SSgt Tan Wu Chyuan, who was with Cpl Zulkefli Bin Zakariah, stopped his CNB vehicle\n\nright behind JDF 755. They had also tailed the 3rdaccused’s car from the\n\ncar park at Block 489 Jurong West Street 41 until it was forced to stop at the traffic\n\nlight junction. Sgt David Ng and W/Sgt Delphine Tan followed in another CNB car.95.    After the\n\naccused’s car was sandwiched between the lorry and the CNB car, the CNB officers Sgt\n\nDavid Ng, W/Sgt Delphine Tan and Cpl Zulkefli alighted from their vehicles and ran to the\n\ndriver’s side of the vehicle JDF 755. They tried to open the car door but it was\n\nlocked. Cpl Zulfkefli showed his handcuffs to the driver of the vehicle and shouted\n\n\"CNB\". They also shouted to him to open the car door but he did not. He seemed\n\nshocked and surprised.96.    SSgt Yon\n\ntestified that the vehicle JDF 755 suddenly jerked forward in an apparent attempt to\n\nescape. He concluded that the driver had refused to open the car door. Sgt David Ng\n\ncorroborated SSgt Yon’s evidence that the vehicle jerked forward slightly after the\n\nCNB officers tried to open the driver’s car door but were unsuccessful. SSgt Yon\n\nquickly smashed the front passenger car window with his crash helmet and opened the car\n\ndoor. He entered the car, leaned across the driver and opened the car door on the\n\ndriver’s side. SSgt Yon denied that he had smashed the car window to instill fear in\n\nthe 3rdaccused. After unbuckling the safety belt, Sgt David Ng pulled the\n\ndriver out of the car. Cpl Zulkefli assisted him. They then pushed him against the side of\n\nthe car and Sgt David Ng handcuffed him behind his back. The 3rdaccused did\n\nnot struggle. Immediately thereafter, they placed the 3rdaccused in the back\n\nseat of JDF 755 because there were onlookers. Cpl Zulkefli explained that they did not\n\nwant to create a scene or embarrass the 3rdaccused. It was also more secure.\n\nCpl Abdullah and Cpl Zulkefli sat next to him on each side. SSgt Yon then drove the\n\nvehicle JDF 755 to Block 1 Upper Thomson Road to avoid causing a traffic congestion at the\n\nMarymount Lane junction as the traffic flow there was heavy.97.    None of the\n\nCNB officers saw any officer slap the accused’s head. No one pushed the accused head\n\ndown. The CNB officers testified that there was no conversation between the officers and\n\nthe 3rdaccused at the junction of Marymount Lane after he was handcuffed. The\n\naccused never explained about his car’s central locking system to the CNB officers.98.    The 3rdaccused testified however that when he was stopped at the said junction, a group of people\n\ncame up to him and knocked hard at the car window with a pair of handcuffs as if they were\n\ntrying to break it. They did not identify themselves. Later he heard voices asking him to\n\nopen the car door. He tried to open it but could not because the CNB officers were lifting\n\nup the external door handle. So he gestured to them to release the door handle. According\n\nto the accused, the control button of the central locking system could not be activated to\n\nunlock the car if the external door handle was being lifted up. He denied jerking his car\n\nforward.He said he was frightened when SSgt Yon smashed the left front car window.99.    The CNB\n\nofficers pulled him out of the car to the road divider and handcuffed him there. During\n\ncross-examination by the learned DPP, the 3rdaccused maintained that the\n\nofficers never pressed his body against the side of JDF 755 to handcuff him. After he was\n\nhandcuffed, someone pressed his head down. Immediately thereafter he felt 3 to 4 officers\n\nslapping his head. On further questioning, the 3rdaccused elaborated that he\n\nwas told to bend his body and put his head down. So he stood at the road divider, bent his\n\nbody about 70 degrees from the vertical, put his head down and the officers were slapping\n\nhis head. I noted that he had not alluded to this manner of assault in his\n\nexamination-in-chief and he appeared to be embellishing his evidence as he was being\n\ncross-examined.100.    He asked\n\nthem what they were doing, who they were and why they had hit him. However, they told him\n\nto shut up and look down. Following that, he heard a female voice telling them in Mandarin\n\nnot to hit him. The beating stopped immediately. Following that, she asked him why he did\n\nnot open the car door. Before he could answer, the CNB officers told him to shut up and\n\nlook down. Subsequently, two officers brought him to the back seat of his vehicle.\n\nHowever, it was earlier put to the CNB officers by counsel based on instructions from the\n\n3rdaccused that the driver had told them about the car’s central locking\n\nsystem apparently to explain why he had not opened the car door. The 3rdaccused did not allude to that at all in his testimony. In fact, he was testifying to the\n\ncontrary that he gave no explanation about the central locking system as he had no chance\n\nto explain when the CNB officers told him to shut up. Such inconsistent instructions\n\ndemonstrated the accused’s propensity to fabricate stories as it suited him, even to\n\nhis own counsel.101.    W/Cpl\n\nDelphine Tan did not see any officer pushing the 3rdaccused’s head down.\n\nNeither did she see several officers slapping the 3rdaccused’s head. She\n\ndenied asking the driver why he had not opened the door to the vehicle. She denied that\n\nshe stopped the other CNB officers from slapping the accused. In fact, she was controlling\n\nthe traffic at that time, which was obviously necessary. I believed her evidence.102.    It was\n\nsubmitted that the manner of arrest and the assaults were intended to create a climate of\n\nfear on the part of the accused to induce him to give his statements later. It was\n\ncontended that he was slapped several times on his head because the officers were\n\n‘frustrated’ that the accused had resisted arrest by not opening the car door. I\n\ncould not understand why the officers should harbour any frustrations or take them out on\n\nthe accused simply because he refused to open the car door at their insistence and an\n\nofficer had to smash the window to unlock the car. It also seemed unlikely for the CNB\n\nofficers to slap the accused in full view of the curious members of the public, who were\n\ngathering to watch. I found that the slapping was concocted by the 3rdaccused.\n\nHe did not seem to me to be a credible witness at all. He had no qualms fabricating a\n\nstory of how W/Cpl Delphine Tan had intervened to stop the slapping. He contradicted his\n\ninstructions to his own counsel concerning his explanation to the CNB officers about the\n\ncentral locking system in his car when he was arrested at the junction of Marymount Lane.\n\nI did not think that the CNB officers would really be interested in the central locking\n\nsystem of his car when they had to worry about the security of the accused, the traffic,\n\nand the removal of all the vehicles obstructing the busy road junction at that time.103.    In my opinion,\n\nwhatever was done was necessary to effect the arrest. The officers did not create any\n\nclimate of fear so that the accused would later give a statement to the investigating\n\nofficer.104.    The 3rdaccused further said that he was frightened when he saw the injuries of the other two\n\naccused persons at the time when they were together with him at CNB to witness the\n\nweighing of the drugs. He was thinking that they could have been assaulted. He became\n\nafraid because he had been allegedly beaten during his arrest. However, he did not\n\ncomplain of the assaults to the doctors at the Alexandra Hospital because a CNB officer\n\nwas present during the medical examination. Yet I noted that on the next day, 23 December\n\n1999, when his statement was being recorded, the 3rdaccused apparently was no\n\nlonger afraid to complain to ASP Fan that he was assaulted, which I found a little\n\nsurprising if what he said was true.105.    According\n\nto the 3rdaccused, a short, fat, middle-aged male Chinese at the CID lock-up\n\nhad told him in the early hours of 23 December 1999 that he would surely be assaulted if a\n\nstatement had not been taken.The 3rdaccused became very frightened.\n\nLater on the same day, he was brought from the CID lock-up to ASP Fan, who took him to his\n\nroom and then handcuffed his left hand to a chair. When he arrived, the interpreter was\n\nnot in ASP Fan’s room yet. The 3rdaccused alleged that ASP Fan thereafter\n\ntold him in Mandarin that he had a lot of evidence to charge him in court. He told him\n\nthat he would have to admit it. The interpreter came in not longer after that. Before ASP\n\nFan recorded his statement, ASF Fan spoke to the 3rdaccused directly and told\n\nhim that he must tell the truth. He did not tell him that his statement could be used\n\nagainst him in court. The 3rdaccused was unaware of the purpose of recording\n\nhis statement. Neither ASP Fan nor the interpreter had told him of the purpose of\n\nrecording the statement.106.    ASP Fan\n\nthen started asking the 3rdaccused questions. Whenever he answered that he did\n\nnot know, ASP Fan ‘appeared to be very fierce’ and continued questioning him.\n\nThe 3rdaccused was frightened when ASP Fan turned ‘fierce’ in his\n\nlooks. His tone of voice would change but he did not raise his voice. When the accused\n\nreplied that he did not know, ASP Fan would insist that he knew the answers. He would want\n\nhim to tell the truth. On occasions during the recording of the statement, ASP Fan spoke\n\ndirectly to him in Mandarin and the interpreter would keep quiet.107.    When the\n\naccused was brought to Subordinate Court No 26 to be charged on 24 December 1999, the two\n\nmale Malay co-accused had allegedly told him that they were assaulted. Apparently, the 3rdaccused became even more fearful of being assaulted by the CNB officers. They had again\n\ntold him of the assaults when he was in Queenstown Remand Prison.108.    I\n\ndisbelieved the accused’s evidence that each of the two male Malays were so keen to\n\ninform the 3rdaccused not once, but twice, of what they alleged had happened\n\nto them. The 1staccused would be concocting an event of assault for the 3rdaccused to hear. As for the 2ndaccused, he would be concocting the slapping to\n\ntell the 3rdaccused. I found no good reason why they should lie to frighten\n\nthe 3rdaccused. Second, these two male Malays were not called at thevoire\n\ndireof the 3rdaccused to corroborate what the 3rdaccused\n\nalleged they had told him. In any event, fear which did not arise out of the acts of the\n\nCNB officers but out of the acts of or information provided or concocted by third parties\n\n(i.e. the short, fat, middle-aged male Chinese and the two male Malays), and self-induced\n\nor self-generated fear were irrelevant.109.    The 3rdaccused alleged that ASP Fan brought him again to his room for the recording of the 2ndstatement on 27 December 1999. Before the interpreter came, the 3rdaccused\n\nasked ASP Fan when he could see his family members. ASP Fan replied, \"See\n\nfirst,\" in Mandarin which the 3rdaccused understood to mean to \"See\n\nthe situation first.\" The 3rdaccused agreed with the learned DPP that ASP\n\nFan made no promises to him about seeing his family. Later, the interpreter came in.\n\nAgain, ASP Fan told him that he must tell the truth. Not long after the commencement of\n\nthe recording of the statement, the telephone in the room rang. ASP Fan picked up the\n\nphone and had a conversation in English with the caller. From the conversation, the 3rdaccused gathered it had something to do with him. Immediately afterwards, ASP Fan asked\n\nhim who Mr Chong was. The 3rdaccused replied that he was his brother-in-law.\n\nHe then asked ASP Fan when he could see his family members. ASP Fan replied, \"Give a\n\nstatement first then only you can see your family members.\" The 3rdaccused said that the first time he was allowed to see his family members was in the\n\nmiddle of January 2000, which was some two weeks later. According to ASP Fan’s\n\nrecords, it was the 11 January 2000.110.    Mr Chong\n\nFook Choy, the brother-in-law of the 3rd accused, testified that he contacted ASP Fan at\n\nabout 12 noon after leaving the office of M/s Palakrishnan and Partners on 27 December\n\n1999. He asked when the family members could see the 3rd accused. However ASP Fan said,\n\n\"Not for the time being because during the investigation no one was supposed to see\n\nhim.\"111.    The 3rdaccused said that the interpreter was not all the time in the room. Sometimes he left the\n\nroom. In his absence, ASP Fan would continue with the recording of his statement and he\n\nwould ask his questions in Mandarin. The accused would answer in Mandarin.112.    Strangely,\n\nfor the recording of the second statement on the 27 December 1999, ASP Fan was no longer\n\nfierce towards him. Even though the 3rdaccused answered ASP Fan that he did\n\nnot know the answer, he was not fierce anymore. I found the accused’s evidence to be\n\nquite unbelievable especially when the 2ndstatement recorded was more\n\nincriminating than the 1ststatement.113.    The 3rdaccused asserted that he would never have given the statement falsely incriminating\n\nhimself if ASP Fan had not told him that he could see his family after the recording of\n\nthe statement. He explained that he did not do it and why should he give such a statement.\n\nHe thought that once he had given a statement, he would be allowed to see his family\n\nmembers immediately. He also stated affirmatively that if he had been told that the\n\nstatement might be used against him, he would never have given the statement. In other\n\nwords, he gave the statement because he was not told that the statement would be used\n\nagainst him. Later, he contradicted himself when he testified that he would still give the\n\nstatement because he was afraid that he might be assaulted and he had no choice.114.    ASP Fan\n\ntestified that prior to recording the 1ststatement, he informed the 3rdaccused that he would be recording a statement from him and it was for the purpose of\n\ninvestigating the case against him. He then asked the accused to tell him what actually\n\nhappened. Additionally, he informed the accused that the statement may be used against\n\nhim. He was also informed him that the statement may be used in court. All this was\n\ninterpreted to the 3rdaccused by Mr Wu. ASP Fan agreed that what he told the 3rdaccused here was not recorded. It was put to ASP Fan by counsel on instructions that they\n\nwere not recorded because he never said any of it to the 3rdaccused. ASP Fan\n\nsaid that was untrue.115.    I could not\n\nobjectively construe what ASP Fan had told the accused to be anywhere near being an\n\ninducement or a threat. By informing him that his statement might be used against him in\n\ncourt, ASP Fan was in fact being honest and fair to the accused. Upon being so informed,\n\nthe accused could then decide for himself whether he would keep quiet. If he decided to\n\nsay something and he later found that what he said was used against him in court, I could\n\nnot see any grounds for him to complain.116.    ASP Fan\n\ndenied telling the accused prior to recording the 1ststatement (a) that he was\n\nbound to say truly everything he knew about the case, or (b) that he had to tell the truth\n\nin relation to what he knew were the circumstances of the case. He again denied having\n\ntold the 3rd accused that he was bound to say truly everything he knew concerning the case\n\nbefore he recorded the 2ndstatement.The interpreter, who was present\n\nthroughout the recording of both statements, substantially corroborated ASP Fan’s\n\nevidence. Mr Wu confirmed that section 121 (2) of the CPC was not explained to the\n\naccused. Mr Wu further confirmed that ASP Fan never told the 3rdaccused that\n\nhe was bound to state the truth in relation to the circumstances of the case. Mr Wu also\n\nrecalled that ASP Fan had told the accused that his statement might be used in court which\n\nMr Wu had interpreted. Counsel again asked Mr Wu whether ASP Fan told the accused (a) that\n\nhe need not say anything that might implicate him, or (b) that the accused was bound to\n\nstate the truth or to tell the truth. Mr Wu reiterated that ASP Fan did not say that.117.    I noted\n\nthat counsel showed ASP Fan section 121(2) of the CPC which reads ‘Such person\n\nshall be bound to state truly the facts and circumstances with which he is acquainted\n\nconcerning the case save only …’ and framed his question as if that\n\nsection 121 (2) was a ‘warning’ that ought to be administered before recording a\n\nsection 121 (1) statement from the accused. After being shown section 121(2), it was most\n\ntempting for the witness to agree that he must, and therefore he did administer that\n\n‘warning’ in part i.e. that he had told the 3rdaccused that he was\n\nbound to state truly the facts and circumstances, forgetting that if that were done, then\n\nhe ought not to omit telling the accused the second portion of section 121 (2) which\n\nstates, ‘save only that he may decline to make with regard to any fact or\n\ncircumstance a statement which would have a tendency to expose him to a criminal charge or\n\nto a penalty or forfeiture.’ If that latter part were omitted, it would\n\namount to a misrepresentation of the true legal effect of section 121 (2) and the\n\nstatement may well be held to be involuntary on account of an inducement (seePublic\n\nProsecutor v Mazlan bin Maidun & Anor[1993] 1 SLR 512;Public Prosecutor v Tan\n\nHo Teck[1988] 3 MLJ 264.). Either the accused is appraised of the entire section in\n\nfull or not at all. Despite being tested in this way repeatedly in different ways each\n\ntime by counsel in his cross-examination, ASP Fan consistently denied that he had told the\n\n3rdaccused words to the effect that he was bound to state the truth. ASP\n\nFan’s practice was simply to tell the accused the purpose of recording the statement,\n\nand then go straight into recording the statement proper. I believed him.118.    ASP Fan\n\ndenied that the 3rdaccused had ever asked him whether he could see his family\n\nprior to the arrival of the interpreter for the recording of his statement on 27 December\n\n1999. He never told the accused that he would ‘see first’. Nor did he have any\n\nconversation in Mandarin with the accused prior to the arrival of the interpreter Mr Wu.\n\nASP Fan maintained that Mr Wu was already in the room before the 3rdaccused\n\ncame in for the recording of the statements. Throughout the recording of the 3rdaccused’s statements, the interpreter was present and never left the room. ASP\n\nFan’s evidence in this paragraph was corroborated by Mr Wu. I again believed him.119.    When ASP\n\nFan was questioned on the telephone call from one of the members of the 3rdaccused’s family, he confirmed that there was such a call but he was uncertain when\n\nit was. Later, ASP Fan said that the call was in the midst of his investigation when the 3rdaccused was still remanded at the CID lock-up. But he could not remember whether or not\n\nthat call was received when he was recording the 3rdaccused’s statement.\n\nHowever, he remembered the accused’s brother-in-law asking when the family members\n\ncould see him and why he was arrested. ASP Fan told him that the accused was arrested for\n\ndrug trafficking and at the moment in time, he could not grant any family visits. ASP Fan\n\ndenied telling the accused to give his statement first before he could see his family\n\nmembers.120.    Mr Wu\n\nclearly stated that there was no occasion when ASP Fan directly asked the 3rdaccused who ‘Chong’ was, whereupon the 3rdaccused answered that\n\nChong was his brother-in-law. Neither had he heard the 3rdaccused ask ASP Fan\n\nimmediately thereafter whether he could see his family to which ASP Fan replied to the 3rdaccused in Mandarin that he should give his statement first, then he could see his family.121.    I did not\n\nbelieve the accused’s evidence that he had made repeated requests to ASP Fan at the\n\nrecording of his 2ndstatement. I found ASP Fan and Mr Wu to be credible\n\nwitnesses and I accepted their version of the events. I thus rejected the accused’s\n\nevidence that he had been induced to give the statements as alleged.122.    Even if it\n\nwere true that Mr Chong had called ASP Fan at the time when the accused’s 2ndstatement was being recorded, it must be observed that the accused was already giving the\n\nstatement without ASP Fan having promised him anything. This strongly suggested that the\n\nalleged inducement that he could see his family after giving his statement did not in fact\n\ncause him to give the statement in the first place. It was likely that he would have\n\ncontinued giving the rest of his statement in any event. In my opinion, ASP Fan seemed\n\nvery clear that he was not going to allow any visits so long as his investigations were\n\nongoing. That was exactly what he told Mr Chong. I could not see any good reason why ASP\n\nFan would turn around and offer the 3rdaccused an inducement after receiving\n\nthe phone call from Mr Chong, and risk having the statement thrown out in court, when the\n\n3rdaccused was already cooperating by volunteering his statement. In any\n\nevent, I accepted Mr Wu’s evidence that no such inducement was offered to the 3rdaccused and he never heard the 3rdaccused making any request to see his family\n\nduring the recording of his 2ndstatement on 27 December 1999. I accepted Mr\n\nWu’s evidence that he was present with ASP Fan before the 3rdaccused came\n\nfor the recording of his statements and he remained for the entire recording of the\n\nstatement and had acted throughout as an interpreter.123.    I also\n\nfound it incredible that ASP Fan, if he had intended to threaten the accused into giving a\n\nstatement, would merely look fierce and yet not raise his voice or make verbal treats to\n\nstrike fear into the 3rdaccused to extract involuntary answers to his\n\nquestions. ASP Fan denied looking at the 3rdaccused in a fierce manner. I did\n\nnot think that the accused would be so readily intimidated by the fierce looks and tone of\n\nvoice of ASP Fan to give a statement incriminating himself, judging by the accused’s\n\nstand that he would never have given ASP Fan the statement if he had known that it would\n\nbe used against him.124.    According\n\nto the 3rdaccused, he did not have anything in mind as to what the purpose of\n\nthe statement was and he therefore would be unaware that the statement could be used\n\nagainst him in court. If so, then I was not surprised that he voluntarily gave a statement\n\nthat incriminated himself as he would not be as guarded when making his statement, which\n\nseemed more likely to be the reason why he was willing to give the incriminating\n\nstatement. His fear of the tone of ASP Fan’s voice or his fierce looks, or the\n\ninducement that he could see his family members only after he had given the statement were\n\nred herrings.125.    I did not\n\naccept the accused’s evidence that he felt he had no choice but to give a statement.\n\nHe could well have told ASP Fan that he had nothing more to say apart from what he had\n\nsaid in his voluntary Section 122(6) statement taken earlier from him, which he did not\n\nchallenge.126.    At the end\n\nof the voire dire, I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable doubt that\n\nboth Section 121 (1) statements were voluntarily given by the 3rdaccused.\n\nAccordingly, they were admitted into evidence.Statements of 1stand 3rdaccused admitted after the voire dire127.    The accuracy of the\n\nstatements admitted after the voire dire was not put in issue. Hence, I assumed that they\n\nwere accurately recorded.128.    The oral\n\nstatement of the 1staccused (B1) made in the flat at about 4.15 p.m. on 22\n\nDecember 1999 when he was questioned in English by SI Ronnie See is as follows:SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Whose house is this?Accused B1 : (Kept quiet.)129.    At about\n\n4.30 p.m., SI Ronnie See spoke again to the 1staccused in English. SSgt\n\nMohamed Isa acted as the Malay interpreter:SI (CNB) Ronnie See : The heroin belongs\n\n  to who?Accused B1 : Don’t know.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Who it belongs to?Accused B1 : Don’t know.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : How you meet accused\n\n  B2 today? (pointing at accused B2)Accused B1 : Today, I called Joe (referring to the 2ndaccused) to meet me at\n\n  the doorstep of this unit.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Then what happened?Accused B1 : When I arrived at the doorstep, Joe actually came out from this unit.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Then what happened?Accused B1 : Both of us then took the lift and when the lift door opened, a party of\n\n  officers came in and arrested both of us. Both of us struggled but we were eventually\n\n  arrested.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Then what happened?Accused B1 : I was later brought to this unit.SI (CNB) Ronnie See : Tell me who the\n\n  heroin belongs to?Accused B1 : I really don’t know.130.    Whilst\n\nstill in the flat, ASP Fan recorded further oral statements in English from the 1staccused at about 5.05 p.m on 22 December 1999:Q1 : Where were you arrested?A1 : Below this block.Q2 : Where was you before you were\n\n  arrested?A2 : I was with ‘Joe’ at the corridor outside.Q3 : Why did you meet ‘Joe’\n\n  here?A3 : I thought that if he got heroin ‘lobang’, I could ask him to give me a bit\n\n  for smoking for free.Q4 : Did you ask him for any heroin?A4 : No. Because I want to go with him for lunch first.Q5 : Did ‘Joe’ give you any\n\n  heroin?A5 : No.Q6 : Who does this belong to?A6 : I do not know.131.    The 1staccused referred to the 2ndaccused as \"Joe\". When ASP Fan asked\n\nquestion 6, he pointed to the plastic bags recovered from behind the cupboard of the\n\nbedroom. The questions and answers were recorded in English in his field book (see P57).\n\nThey were read back to the 1staccused in English by ASP Fan and the 1staccused affirmed them to be correct, at the end of which the 1staccused signed\n\nin the field book, followed by ASP Fan. The recording ended at about 5.15 p.m.132.    I now set\n\nout the two Section 122(1) CPC statements of the 3rdaccused recorded at CNB by\n\nASP Fan on 23 December 1999 and on 27 December 1999 which I had admitted into evidence:1ststatement recorded on 23\n\n  December 1999 at about 3.40 pm in CNB Office at room #01-04I am also known as \"Ah Long\" to\n\n  my friends.2. On 22.12.99, the day when I was\n\n  arrested, I arrived in Singapore at about 12.00 p.m. via Woodlands checkpoint. I drove\n\n  into Singapore alone in a white Proton Wira bearing registration number JDF 755. I then\n\n  drove straight to Blk 422 Ang Mo Kio Ave 3 to collect a receipt of handphone repair from\n\n  my Malaysian friend Tee Chee Seong who works in Singapore. His handphone number is\n\n  97348221. At the same time, I also borrowed about S$20,000/- contained in a large brown\n\n  envelope from him for my illegal game arcade business in Malaysia. I am one of the\n\n  partners in the business. A short while later, I left for Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1.3. At about 1.00 p.m. plus, I reached the\n\n  carpark of Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1. I then parked my car at one of the parking lots\n\n  nearer to Blk 489. I got out from the car and called a number and spoke to the person in\n\n  Malay. I said to him \"Saya suda sambai\". The person then asked me to go to the 6thstorey in Malay. I then removed a blue plastic bag from the floorboard at the rear\n\n  passenger seat. After which, I took the blue plastic bag and went up to the 6thstorey corridor using the centre lift. After coming out from the lift, I turned right and\n\n  saw a male Malay. Without speaking to him, I handed over the blue plastic bag to him and\n\n  he in turn gave me a brown envelope in which I knew contained money. I took the lift back\n\n  to the ground floor and went back to my car. In the car, I opened the large brown envelope\n\n  which I got from my friend earlier on and counted the money which amounted to S$24,950.\n\n  They were in denominations of S$1,000, S$50, and S$10. After counting the money, I placed\n\n  both the brown envelopes underneath the front passenger seat. I then drove off intending\n\n  to go to Ang Mo Kio Centre to collect a handphone which was sent for repairs.4. On my way to Ang Mo Kio via PIE, I\n\n  stopped at the traffic lights at the junction of Marymount Road and Thomson Road. Before\n\n  the traffic lights turned green, I saw a group of men approach my car and knocked on my\n\n  window. One of them tried opening the door at the driver’s side but could not open\n\n  it. They then smashed the window at the front passenger’s seat. I was brought out of\n\n  the car and handcuffed.5. I am now shown a blue plastic bag and I\n\n  recognise it as the blue plastic bag that I had mentioned earlier in my statement\n\n  (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown a blue plastic bag labelled as ‘A1a\"\n\n  which was recovered in a raid on Blk 489 Jurong West Ave 1 #03-37). I am also shown two\n\n  photographs of two male Malays but I could not recognise if they are the male Malay whom I\n\n  earlier mentioned contacting in my statement (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown two\n\n  photographs of Abdul Salam Bin Musthafa, IC: S7002309-A and Suboh Bin Ramli, IC:\n\n  S7730598-Z). However, I remembered that I have the contact number of the male Malay whom I\n\n  mentioned speaking to over the handphone. I am now shown a grey Nokia handphone with black\n\n  cover which I recognised as mine (Recorder’s note :- Accused is shown a grey Nokia\n\n  handphone seized from the accused on the day of arrest and asked to retrieve the number of\n\n  the male Malay. I found the number to be 97991601.)6. After I was arrested, one of the men\n\n  drove my car to the side of the road and searched the car. I was also asked some questions\n\n  in Mandarin. However, nothing was found and I was then brought back to an office. Later,\n\n  three men and a women came with two dogs and the dogs started sniffing my car. The door\n\n  panels and rear sat were also removed but nothing was found. The panels were then fixed\n\n  back and my urine samples were taken and tested. ……… I was then brought to\n\n  another office where an officer weighed some heroin in the presence of myself and two\n\n  other male Malays. The money recovered from me was then counted by another officer. I was\n\n  then given dinner before being brought to the hospital for medical check. After the\n\n  medical check, I was again brought back to the office where the officer read out a charge\n\n  to me and a statement was also taken from me. After the statement, I was again brought\n\n  back to see a doctor after which I was placed in the lock-up.2ndstatement of Wong Kok\n\n  Loong, IC: A3391382 (FOM) recorded on 27.12.99 at 11.20 a.m. in CNB MIB room #01-04.7. My previous statement recorded\n\n  on 23.12.99 was read back to me in Mandarin and I affirm it to be true and correct.8. I am the sixth child in a family of\n\n  seven. I started working after I had completed Form Two and at the end of 1991, I started\n\n  to work in Singapore as a painter. I switched to working in the shipyard early last year\n\n  and in October 1998, I went back to become a painter, working for my elder brother. In\n\n  July 1999, I stopped working as a painter and went back to Johor Bahru. I was then not\n\n  working but still entered Singapore frequently to visit friends. Sometime in October 1999,\n\n  I started operating a game arcade in Taman Lenting at Johor Bahru with a Malaysian friend\n\n  of mine. I spent about $3,000/- Malaysian Ringgit on the business, which is from both my\n\n  savings and loan from friends.9. A few months ago, at a discotheque\n\n  ‘Golden Palace’ in Johor Bahru, I got to know a Malaysian man known as ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’. Since then, we met up often for drinks and on one occasion, ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’ asked me if I wanted to work for him and his boss known as ‘Ngow\n\n  Chai’ by bringing things to Singapore as he knew that I was in need of money. I have\n\n  not seen 'Ngow Chai’ and I did not give him a reply immediately. After about a month,\n\n  that is sometime in late October 1999, I met 'Ah Bear' again in the discotheque and I told\n\n  me that I will take up the job he offered. ‘Ah Bear’ then asked me to wait for\n\n  his call and I gave him my handphone number. I do not have the contact number of ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’.10. After a week, ‘Ah Bear’\n\n  called me and asked me to meet him at the ‘7-11’ store at Pemas in my car JDF\n\n  755. He handed over to me a bag and told me to enter Singapore. I then placed the bag in\n\n  the car boot under the spare tyre. He told me that he will call me after I entered\n\n  Singapore and give me the contact number of the person whom I was to hand over the bag to\n\n  in Singapore. About half an hour later, I entered Singapore and ‘Ah Bear’ called\n\n  me on my handphone and gave me the phone number of the receiver of the plastic bag, who is\n\n  a male Malay. I then contacted the person whose number was given by ‘Ah Bear’.\n\n  The person then asked me to go the road along Bukit Panjang Plaza and at that place, I\n\n  handed over the plastic bag. No money was handed over to me by the male Malay. After that,\n\n  I immediately drove back to Malaysia and met him at a coffeeshop. He handed $600/- ringgit\n\n  to me and told me that it is for bringing three packets of things. ‘Ah Bear’ did\n\n  not tell me what the packet of things were.11. On another occasion which was about a\n\n  week or so before I was arrested, ‘Ah Bear’ called me again and I met up with\n\n  him again at the same ‘7-11’ store. He handed over a bag to me and I again kept\n\n  it in the car boot under the spare tyre. I entered Singapore and ‘Ah Bear’\n\n  called me on the handphone giving me the contact number. I contacted the receiver and it\n\n  was a male Chinese who spoke to me in Mandarin. The person asked me to go the Chinatown\n\n  Point and over at the roadside, I handed over the plastic bag to him. No money was handed\n\n  to me. I went back to Johor Bahru and met up with ‘Ah Bear’ at a coffeeshop,\n\n  different from the previous occasion. This time, ‘Ah bear’ gave me $800/-\n\n  ringgit but did not tell me the number of packets that was brought into Singapore.12. On the eve of my arrest, ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’ called me at about 11.00 p.m. to inform me that I have got to work and at about\n\n  midnight, he asked me to meet him at the same ‘7-11’ store. He then handed over\n\n  a blue plastic bag to me and like the previous times, told me that he would call me again\n\n  when I am in Singapore. He also told me then to enter Singapore by 12.00 p.m. I then took\n\n  the plastic bag and left it in the car boot. He did not tell me how much he will be paying\n\n  me after the delivery. As such, I do not know how many packets were in the bag. However,\n\n  ‘Ah Bear’ told me to collect money from the person who collects the bag from me\n\n  but did not tell me the amount of money I was to collect. After that, ‘Ah Bear’\n\n  left in his own car, a blue Honda CRV. I then went home to sleep. My car was locked and\n\n  parked at home. Nobody other than myself uses the car.13. On the day of my arrest, I woke up at\n\n  about 11.00 a.m. After washing up, I went to my car and hid the plastic bag which ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’ gave to me under the spare tyre in the car boot. After which, I left for\n\n  Singapore in my car. At about 12.00 p.m., I entered into Singapore via Woodlands\n\n  checkpoint. I used the green lane and was not checked by the police. As ‘Ah\n\n  Bear’ did not call me, I went to look for a friend of mine to borrow money for my\n\n  business. I had arranged with my friend to borrow money and therefore, I forked out time\n\n  to collect it from him. At the carpark at Ang Mo Kio, I took out the blue plastic bag and\n\n  transferred to the floorboard of the rear passenger seat. While removing it from the car\n\n  boot, I saw about one to two packets of yellow substance inside the bag. I wish to say\n\n  that I do not know what was the yellow substance. After I had collected the money from my\n\n  friend, ‘Ah Bear’ called me and gave me the contact number for a male Malay. I\n\n  keyed in the number into my handphone. Although I had planned to collect a handphone sent\n\n  for repairs, I went straight to Jurong West as ‘Ah Bear’ told me that the person\n\n  is already waiting. I immediately called the number which ‘Ah Bear’ gave me and\n\n  the male Malay answered the call. I asked him where he was and he told me that he was at\n\n  Blk 489 Jurong West. He also told me to call him again when I had reached there. Upon\n\n  reaching Blk 489 Jurong West at about 1 plus p.m., I called the male Malay and he told me\n\n  to go to the 6thstorey where I handed the plastic bag to him. I also collected\n\n  some money. After leaving Jurong West at about 2.00 p.m., I headed towards Ang Mo Kio but\n\n  was arrested somewhere along the junction at Thomson Road and Marymount Road.14. Although ‘Ah bear’ did not\n\n  tell me what the things I brought in were, I believed that the things were illegal as he\n\n  told me to hide the things well. I never thought that if arrested, I would face the death\n\n  penalty.Adjourned for lunch at 12.55 p.m.Statement resumed at 2.10 p.m.15. The car which I am using, a white\n\n  Proton Wira bearing registration number JDF 755 was bought sometime in April 1999. I had\n\n  to pay $35,000 ringgit in cash by my mother paid about $26,000/- ringgit while the rest\n\n  was paid by me. I still have a few thousand dollars savings in my bank in Malaysia. I\n\n  agreed to work for ‘Ah Bear’ because I was short of cash and I owed people\n\n  money. I owed my friends about $10,000/- ringgit in total. Every month, my income from\n\n  operating the game arcade ranges between $1,000/- to $2,000/- ringgit and that is often\n\n  less than my spending on the car, handphone, discotheques. I will borrow money from my\n\n  friends and that is why I owe people bout $10,000/- ringgit. I used my own car to deliver\n\n  things for ‘Ah Bear’ as I do not know that it is so serious.16. I wish to say that in the Friday\n\n  morning (24.12.99) when my case was first mentioned in court, I was taken out from my cell\n\n  in the lock-up at CID and taken to another cell for my breakfast. I was placed in cell 3\n\n  at that time and the cell which I was brought to was just next to the officers’ room.\n\n  A while later, a male Malay whom was arrested on the same day with me was brought into the\n\n  same cell. At that time, only two of us were in the cell. While waiting for our breakfast,\n\n  the male Malay started talking to me in Malay and asked me what did I say in my statement\n\n  and also if I recognised anybody. I told him that I informed the officer that I brought\n\n  the plastic bag up to the 6thfloor and also to collect money and I did not\n\n  know what was in the plastic bag. The male Malay then told me that he had asked his friend\n\n  to admit but his friend refused to. He also explained to me that as his friend has the key\n\n  to the flat and a few sachets on the body, his friend should admit and save him. After\n\n  that, he stopped talking to me and we were sent to court. His friend was not present then.17 I am now shown two photographs which I\n\n  recognised as the two male Malays whom were arrested on the same day as me\n\n  (Recorder’s note:- Accused is shown two polaroid photographs of Abdul Salam Bin\n\n  Musthafa, IC: S7002309-A and Suboh Bin Ramli, IC: S7730598-Z). I recognise the man in grey\n\n  shirt as the one who spoke to me while I was in the CID lock-up, asking about my statement\n\n  to the officer (Recorder’s note:- Accused pointed to one Abdul Salam Bin Musthafa,\n\n  IC: S7002309-A).Close of Prosecution’s Case133.    At the\n\nclose of the prosecution’s case, counsel for all three accused made no submissions. I\n\nfound that the prosecution had made out a prima facie case against them on the charges.\n\nAccordingly, I called them to give evidence in their defence after administering the\n\nstandard allocution. The 1stand 2ndaccused elected to give\n\nevidence. The 3rdaccused deferred making his election. When the trial reached\n\nthe stage where he had to decide, he chose to remain silent.Defence of 1staccused134.    Salam\n\ntestified that he was unemployed prior to his arrest. He had to return home by 7.00 p.m.\n\ndaily and report every Monday at the police station. He could not get a job because of\n\nthese restrictions imposed on him after his release from prison on 1 October 1999. He was\n\nstaying at his mother’s flat at Block 137 Yishun Ring Road. His family members\n\ncomprising his mother, elder sister and two elder brothers supported him initially. But in\n\nNovember 1999, he felt embarrassed to ask them for more money. So he pawned his jewellery\n\non 9 November 1999 for $3,500 to spend on some clothes, shoes, drinking, cigarettes,\n\nentertainment and daily expenses. He gave his mother about $500 and bought presents for\n\nhis nephews and sisters. He also spent some money on prostitutes.135.    He met\n\nSuboh, who was known to him as ‘Joe’, sometime in 1996 or 1997 when he was in\n\nChangi prison. Suboh was then in the Reformative Training Centre (‘RTC’).\n\nOccasionally, the RTC inmates would visit the prison.136.    After his\n\nrelease from prison, he met up with Suboh for the first time in November 1999 at Orchard\n\nRoad. Suboh gave him his handphone and pager numbers. As Salam did not have any handphone\n\nor pager, he did not give Suboh any contact numbers. Some two weeks after that first brief\n\nmeeting, Salam phoned Suboh. They met up again, had some food and chit-chatted. But there\n\nwas no discussion about finding jobs. This second meeting was also in November. Thus far,\n\nSalam did not regard Suboh as his close or good friend.137.    On 21\n\nDecember 1999, the day before the arrest, Salam discussed job opportunities with his\n\nfriends over some drinks at a coffee shop at Block 101 Yishun Ring Road. According to\n\nSalam, these friends do not consume drugs. They only drink.138.    Salam\n\nneeded a job badly as he had about $200 left. He needed money for the Hari Raya festive\n\nseason which was around the corner. He was also feeling bored doing nothing at home. He\n\nhad previously asked his brother and his friends to help him get a job. Then he remembered\n\nSuboh and called him to ask if he had any job openings. Suboh told him to call again the\n\nnext day.139.    Salam thought that\n\nhe might have some contacts for daily-rated jobs since he had been out of prison for quite\n\nsome time. Additionally, Suboh might have friends who could help. Salam had not asked\n\nSuboh for help in getting a job during those earlier two meetings because he had no\n\nintention to work so soon after his release from prison. He wanted to enjoy himself first.\n\nLater, he clarified that he could not remember whether he did or did not ask Suboh about\n\njob opportunities on the two occasions that they had met in November 1999.140.    At the\n\ncoffee shop that day, Salam happened to meet for the first time another friend whom he had\n\nmet at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. That friend, whom he suspected to be a heroin\n\naddict from his appearance, asked Salam if he wanted to buy any drugs. Salam testified\n\nthat he bought two straws of heroin at $20 per straw since he was rather bored and his\n\nmother did not permit consumption of alcohol at home.141.    Prior to\n\nthe chance meeting with this drug pusher, Salam had not met any other drug pushers since\n\nhis release from prison. When asked if he would have bought drugs if he had met another\n\ndrug pusher earlier, his frank answer was, ‘Cannot say’. I had to assess if he\n\nwould seize an opportunity when one was available. In any event, he could not resist the\n\ntemptation to buy drugs for his consumption when the first available opportunity was\n\npresented to him, although he knew that he was still subjected to the strict Monday\n\nreporting routine at the police station. The difficulty here was to assess whether he was\n\nindeed involved with Suboh in an alleged drug trafficking enterprise when the golden\n\nopportunity presented itself on 22 December 1999, having regard to his desperate need for\n\nfunds and his inability to get a job for some 2  months. There was no direct evidence\n\nbut only circumstantial evidence. The important question was whether that circumstantial\n\nevidence had become irresistible pointing to the only conclusion that he was involved in a\n\njoint drug trafficking enterprise.142.    When\n\ncross-examined on how he was going to support his rather lavish spending, Salam explained\n\nfairly convincingly what his plans were for the future, and why he spent so much on\n\nhimself after he pawned his jewellery for $3,500. He said that was the only time he could\n\nenjoy himself after leaving prison. Once he started on a permanent job, he would not be\n\nable to do so due to the restrictions of the job, police supervision and time\n\nrestrictions. He gave the impression that he would curb his spending and limit his outings\n\nand enjoyment to perhaps once a week. For that, a job paying him about $1000 per month\n\nwould suffice. He would also be satisfied with a painter’s job paying him $50 per\n\nday. Salam said that he was a welder at Jurong previously.143.    In my view, that is\n\na fairly skilled job. With this previous job experience, I think that the accused has the\n\nnecessary skills for a daily-rated labourer’s job or even a permanent labourer’s\n\njob paying an amount of wages that would likely be sufficient for his needs provided he\n\ndoes not spend as lavishly.144.    Continuing\n\nwith the events of 21 December 1999, Salam testified that he returned home from the coffee\n\nshop and joined his family members to break the fast as it was still the fasting month.\n\nThereafter, he went to his room and smoked one straw. This was the first time he started\n\nre-consuming heroin after his release from prison. Later he went to bed.145.    The next\n\nmorning on 22 December 1999, he called Suboh on his handphone but could not get through.\n\nHe went to the market to have his breakfast. Upon his return and before going upstairs to\n\nhis mother’s flat, he called Suboh at about 9.00 a.m and managed to contact him.\n\nSalam told Suboh that he wanted to meet him and discuss job opportunities.146.    What Salam\n\nhad in mind were jobs like painting whereby he would have flexible working hours or other\n\ndaily-rated jobs whereby he could leave early and be home by 7.00 p.m. I asked the 1staccused how would he know whether Suboh would have jobs to recommend. He said that he was\n\njust trying his luck. He knew that Suboh had been released from jail for quite some time.\n\nSo he guessed that he must have some contacts. When pressed by the learned DPP whether\n\nSuboh had informed him that he had a job ready for him, Salam said that he could not\n\nremember the exact words but Suboh said something like \"OK, you can come, we will\n\ntalk about it later.\" When asked why he bothered to go all the way to Jurong from\n\nYishun when Suboh never hinted whether he had a job ready for him, Salam said that he did\n\nnot mind going there because he had nothing else to do at home in any case. Even if he did\n\nnot like the kind of job, they could still go for a walk and have a meal together. He\n\nexplained that if he were to meet him, he could then talk to him about the job. He need\n\nnot have to pressurize him on the phone to tell him about the job first.147.    In that\n\ntelephone conversation, Suboh said that he was not free and that Salam could only see him\n\nat about 1.00 p.m. Salam then asked where they should meet. Suboh told him to meet at\n\nBlock 489, Jurong West Avenue 1. Salam asked for directions and was told that there was a\n\nKentucky Fried Chicken (‘KFC’) restaurant there and the block behind was Block\n\n489. Suboh told him to take the stairs to the third floor. The flat was the first one on\n\nthe right. Suboh also told him that there was an unused cupboard placed in front of the\n\nunit and he would not miss it.148.    Salam then\n\nvoiced his concern what if he was not there when he arrived at the flat. Suboh told him to\n\nwait downstairs for him. Salam told Suboh that his urine might be tainted with drugs and\n\nhence, he could not meet him downstairs in case of spot-checks by the police. Salam asked\n\n\"How then?\". Suboh then said that he would keep the door slightly ajar. He told\n\nSalam to go inside the flat, close the door and wait for him, should he not be there.\n\nAfter that phone call, Salam went back to his house, took his bath, consumed the second\n\nstraw of heroin at about 11.30 a.m. or 12 noon. He left his mother’s flat at about\n\n12.30 p.m. He said that he felt high and a bit ‘blurry’ after consuming the\n\nheroin but he was not feeling tired. Then later, he said he was still alert although he\n\nwas high, which appeared contradictory.149.    He took a\n\ntaxi to Block 489, Jurong West Avenue 1, because it was safer for him as he had consumed\n\ndrugs. Furthermore, he was not familiar with the Jurong area. Salam informed the driver\n\nthat the block was near a KFC outlet. However upon arrival at about 1.00 pm, the taxi\n\ndriver took a wrong turn and stopped at Jurong West Street 41. The taxi driver told Salam\n\nto walk across the block to reach Block 489. Salam did as directed and walked in from the\n\nmain road.150.    As he was\n\nwalking towards the block, he saw a kiosk at the void deck of block 486. He bought two\n\ncans of soya bean drink and was given a red plastic bag to carry them in. He was feeling\n\nvery thirsty after consuming the drugs. His throat felt uncomfortable after consuming the\n\nsecond straw of heroin. After buying the drinks, he walked across to Block 487 and glanced\n\nupwards to look at Block 489. He saw that there was indeed an old cupboard in front of the\n\nunit. This helped him to locate the unit. He took the lift to the 6thfloor,\n\nwalked along the 6thfloor common corridor to the staircase on the left end of\n\nthe block, and walked down to the 3rdfloor. He did not take the staircase as\n\ndirected as he was feeling lazy after consuming the heroin. He explained that he had no\n\ndifficulty finding the unit because he had already spotted it from the carpark.. Further,\n\nhe stayed in a HDB flat in Yishun, where he would similarly take a lift to the 6thfloor and then walk along the common corridor to take the staircase that led down to his\n\nmother’s flat on the 4thfloor. So he was not altogether unfamiliar with\n\nthe common corridor connections to HDB flats which were not located at lift level.151.    When he\n\nreached the unit with the old cupboard outside it, he found that the main door was\n\nslightly ajar and he knew that Suboh was not in. The metal gate was not locked but it was\n\nclosed. He did not notice any padlock. Salam then went inside, closed the door and waited\n\nfor Suboh. At first, he sat on a chair in the hall and smoked a cigarette. He saw that the\n\nwhole flat was very messy. He went to the first bedroom and noticed that it was similarly\n\nvery dirty and messy. He did not enter this bedroom. In any case, it was cramped full with\n\nitems strewn all over the floor that he could not enter. He then went to the next room and\n\nhe noticed that the kitchen was dirty. He saw however that the room nearer the kitchen was\n\nfairly empty.152.    His\n\nimpression was that this flat could be a place where Suboh might spend the night. He\n\nopined that it was a common practice for young people to spend the night elsewhere instead\n\nof their homes. He did not think that anyone lived in the flat because it was so dirty.153.    As his\n\nthroat was not feeling well, he took some newspapers, placed them on the floor, leaned his\n\nback against a small cupboard and rested in the master bedroom near the attached bathroom.\n\nThere was no bed. He decided to rest in the master bedroom as it was rather spacious. He\n\nalso wanted to use the attached toilet. Whilst he was there, he consumed 1  cans of soya\n\nbean drink and smoked cigarettes to prolong the high feeling from the drug. He found an\n\nantique bowl and used it as an ashtray. Altogether he smoked one cigarette in the hall and\n\nlater, about five cigarettes in the master bedroom.154.    About 30 to\n\n40 minutes later, Suboh arrived. He only saw Suboh when he was at the front of the master\n\nbedroom. After they greeted each other, Salam asked if he wanted to go out immediately to\n\ndiscuss about his job contacts over lunch. Suboh told him to rest first as he had some\n\nmatters to attend to, and that he should wait a while for him. Salam did not mind waiting.\n\nSuboh then stepped out of the master bedroom, and closed the door. Before closing the\n\ndoor, Suboh told him that he would call when he was ready. Salam testified that he did not\n\nsleep but he continued to smoke to accentuate the high feeling arising from consumption of\n\nthe drug.155.    Counsel\n\nquestioned Salam whether he could see the front door of the flat from where he was seated,\n\nto which he replied in the negative.156.    After about\n\n45 minutes, Suboh opened the door to the master bedroom and told Salam, ‘Lan,\n\nlet’s go and eat. We can talk outside.\" Salam folded the newspapers and put them\n\naside. They then left the flat.157.    At first,\n\nSalam testified that Suboh opened the main door, unlocked the padlock to the gate. Later\n\nin cross-examination, Salam said that he did not really notice but he thought that Suboh\n\njust opened the gate. Salam went out and waited for Suboh, who thereafter locked the door\n\nand the gate. They both walked up the stairs with Suboh ahead of him. He just followed\n\nSuboh. It did not cross his mind to consider that it might be easier to descend to the\n\nground level via the staircase than to walk up to the 6thfloor to take the\n\nlift because he was chit-chatting with Suboh at that time.158.    Salam was\n\nnot carrying anything except his lighter and the ‘Salem’ cigarette box with one\n\ncigarette left. He smoked that last cigarette as he was walking up the staircase to the 6thfloor lift landing. He crushed the cigarette box and threw it away near the lift together\n\nwith the disposable lighter, which had only a small amount of lighter fuel left.159.    All this\n\nwhile, he followed Suboh and walked along the 6thfloor common corridor, took\n\nthe lift and descended to the ground floor. When the lift door opened, they were arrested.\n\nSubsequently, they were brought up to the flat #03-37 at Block 489.160.    When SI\n\nRonnie See asked him and Suboh, \"Whose house is this?\", he kept quiet as he did\n\nnot know whose house it was, and he had no answer. The CNB officers conducted a search of\n\nthe unit. The officers retrieved a blue bag from the 1stbedroom (P8). Then SI\n\nRonnie See asked Suboh, \"Whose drug is it?\". He heard Suboh answer that he did\n\nnot know.161.    SI Ronnie\n\nSee turned to question him. Salam did not dispute that his answers, admitted into evidence\n\nafter the voire dire, were accurately recorded. However, he said that the answers he gave\n\n(i.e. that he called Joe to meet him at the doorstep of the flat and that when he arrived\n\nat the doorstep, Joe actually came out from the flat) were untrue. Salam explained that he\n\nfelt frightened, having entered the flat first before Suboh did. So when SI Ronnie See\n\nasked the question, he told the CNB officer that Suboh entered the flat first.\n\nFurthermore, Suboh had denied knowledge of the drugs. When he saw the huge amount of drugs\n\nfound, he was afraid that the CNB might accuse him of possession of those drugs because he\n\nentered the flat first and Suboh had refused to admit to possession of the drugs.162.    Salam also\n\nsaid that the following answers to ASP Fan were untrue.:Q2 : Where was you before you were\n\n  arrested?A2 : I was with ‘Joe’ at the corridor outside.Q3 : Why did you meet ‘Joe’\n\n  here?A3 : I thought that if he got heroin ‘lobang’, I could ask him to give me a bit\n\n  for smoking for free.163.    Salam\n\nreiterated that upon realising that Suboh was not admitting that the drugs belonged to him\n\nand he had further refused to say who owned the drugs, Salam was afraid that he might be\n\ncharged for possession. So he gave ASP Fan those answers in fear and in haste. He did not\n\nknow why he gave such answers. He asserted that he went there to get a job contact from\n\nSuboh. I questioned Salam further to find out why he answered in the manner he did:His Honour : Normally, when you say,\n\n  \"Got heroin ‘lobang’,\" what do you normally mean?Witness : Any method or any place where heroin can be gotten.His Honour : \"Any place where heroin\n\n  can be obtained?\"Interpreter : \"Obtained\", yes.Witness : Likewise, when you use the word \"lobang\", it can also mean \"job\n\n  availability\".His Honour : Why do you think that Suboh\n\n  would have some heroin ‘lobang’?Witness : Before the drugs were discovered, I didn’t know that he has any connection\n\n  with drugs. But when once the drugs were discovered, I think he must have got some\n\n  connection. Oh, sorry. Yes. When the drugs were discovered, I became panicky and gave this\n\n  answer.164.    Salam\n\ndenied the learned DPP’s suggestion that he went all the way from Yishun to Jurong\n\nWest not to look for a job ‘lobang’ but to look for a drug ‘lobang’.\n\nHe also denied that he was ever at the doorway alone or with Suboh when the 3rdaccused came to the flat #03-37. He said that he had never seen the 3rdaccused\n\nbefore.Salam was asked:Q4 : Did you ask him [i.e. Suboh] for any\n\n  heroin?A4 : No. Because I want to go with him for lunch first.165.    Salam clarified\n\nthat he did not want to ask Suboh about the heroin. He just wanted to go out and have\n\nlunch with him.166.    When he was\n\ntaken for the urine test, he made eye contact with Suboh and mouthed the words to him to\n\nreveal who the owner of the drugs was. From Suboh’s facial expression, Salam knew\n\nthat he did not want to do that. Salam testified that he also mouthed to Suboh that if the\n\ndrugs belonged to him, then he should own up and if they were not his, then he should tell\n\nwho the actual owner was. Suboh did not pay attention to him. Again from his facial\n\nexpression, Salam realised that Suboh was not going to reveal anything.167.    His counsel\n\nthen took him through certain parts of his long statement in particular the part where he\n\nhad walked down the stairs to the 3rdfloor after taking the lift to the 6thfloor. Salam testified that the following parts of his statement were untrue:Paragraph 6\"I knocked on the door but there was\n\n  no response. I then went back to the 7thstorey by the stairs and waited there\n\n  for a while. After about 15 to 20 minutes, I went back to the house at the 3rdstorey and knocked on the door again. ‘Joe’ opened the door …\"Paragraph 10\"..I think that\n\n  ‘Joe’ will know [about the drugs found] because he was in the house before I\n\n  reached there.\"Paragraph 15\"..I also wish to say again that I\n\n  have never entered into the house at the 3rdstorey of Blk 489 Jurong West\n\n  …. After I arrived as nobody answered the door when I knocked on it for about a\n\n  minute the first time. I think that my knocking was quite soft and maybe ‘Joe\"\n\n  did not hear me. The second time, when I went back to the house, I knocked on the door\n\n  similarly but for a little longer and ‘Joe’ opened the door.\"168.    Salam gave\n\nthe same explanation that he was afraid because Suboh had not admitted to ownership of the\n\ndrugs. So he omitted saying that he had gone into the flat first for fear that he would be\n\nentangled in this when in actual fact he had nothing to do with the flat nor the drugs.169.    Salam also\n\nretracted the following portion of paragraph 8 of his statement which he said was also\n\nuntrue:I told him that I did not smoke heroin but\n\n  I did consume cough mixture and panadol because I was sick. I did not see a doctor as it\n\n  was not serious. A childhood friend of mine whom I do not have the contact number of gave\n\n  me a bottle of cough mixture. I do not know why my urine was tested positive and I believe\n\n  that it is because of the cough mixture.170.    He did not\n\nadmit to ASP Fan that he had consumed a straw of heroin on the 21 December and also a\n\nsecond straw on the 22ndDecember 1999 because his mind was muddled and he had\n\njust been released from prison. He did not wish to be charged in court again, imprisoned\n\nor fined. His story about consumption of the cough mixture was false.171.    I observed\n\nthat Salam could readily spin a good story with sufficient details added to make it more\n\nbelievable. The cough mixture story was a good example. Thus, I had to evaluate his\n\nevidence carefully as he was a self-confessed liar. He had no hesitation to lie and\n\nfalsely implicate the other co-accused just to save his own skin.172.    Salam also\n\ngave evidence on how he found he found a Nokia handphone left behind by someone on top of\n\na toilet in a pub. He threw away the SIM card and took the handphone back. He knew that\n\nthe SIM card belonged to someone else. He testified that in case he was caught with it and\n\nif the handphone were inspected, then they would not find the owner’s SIM card. He\n\ncould then tell the person that the handphone belonged to him. This again showed\n\nSalam’s ability to lie when the occasion required it.173.    Salam\n\nexplained that he had no intention to buy another SIM card. He did not have a job yet and\n\nhe could use the public phones. On 22 December 1999, he brought the unusable handphone\n\nalong with him as he wanted to sell the handphone perhaps for a few hundred dollars as his\n\nfunds were running low then. He only had $260 with him. He had the intention to ask Suboh\n\nif he would be interested to buy it and if he did not want it, he could always try asking\n\nother friends of his in Orchard Road.174.    Salam\n\ndenied Suboh’s version of the events as put to him by Suboh’s counsel. He denied\n\nthat he had the keys to open the gate and door to get into the flat before Suboh arrived.\n\nHe denied the suggestion that ‘Apid’ gave him the keys. He maintained that he\n\ndid not know Hazafi Bin Dolwahab. He denied having brought up any subject on sale of VCDs.\n\nNor had he shown a bag containing drugs and VCDs to Suboh.175.    Salam was\n\ncandid enough to admit that he was detained for 5 years for suspected drug trafficking\n\nactivities when he was cross-examined by counsel for Suboh.Prosecution’s case against Salam176.    Basically,\n\nthe prosecution’s case was that Salam had gone to the flat for the purpose of taking\n\ndelivery and dealing with the drugs found in the flat on 22 December 1999. The prosecution\n\nsubmitted that it was unbelievable that he had gone all the way to Yishun to meet Suboh\n\nand discuss job opportunities, when Suboh had not yet promised him a job.177.    Another\n\npoint highlighted was the accused’s familiarity with the flat at Blk 489 because he\n\nhad not followed Suboh’s purported instructions to the flat via the staircase, but\n\nhad taken a lift instead to the 6thfloor and then walked down to the flat on\n\nthe 3rdfloor.178.    The story\n\nthat Suboh left the door ajar for him was said to be unbelievable because there was no\n\nagreement on the actual time that Suboh would be there, except that he would be there\n\nafter 1 pm.179.    The\n\nprosecution also submitted that Salam’s story that he sat inside the master bedroom\n\nfor a total of some 1  hours with the windows closed, with no fan, no air conditioning\n\nand with lights switched off and the door closed was incredulous. It was hardly believable\n\nthat he did not step out of the room during this whole period of time in such unbearable\n\nconditions.180.    The prosecution\n\nrelied on the accused’s answer that he met Suboh because he thought that Suboh had\n\nheroin ‘lobang’ and so he could ask Suboh to give some to him to smoke for free.\n\nThis implied that he had knowledge of the drugs found in the flat. As this answer was\n\ngiven in haste, it was likely that it was true because it reflected what actually\n\nhappened.181.    It was\n\nhighlighted that Salam gave a total of four versions for his presence at the unit. The\n\nfirst version was that given to SI Ronnie See when Salam admitted to be the one who took\n\nthe initiative to call Suboh to meet him at the front of the unit. The second version was\n\nthat given to ASP Fan at the unit when he told him that he had gone there in the hope of\n\ngetting drugs to smoke for free. The third version appeared in his investigation statement\n\nwhen he informed ASP Fan that he went there because Suboh called him there to give him\n\nsome work to do and he never entered the unit at all. The fourth and final version given\n\nin court was that Suboh told him to go there to discuss job opportunities and he entered\n\nthe unit.182.    The\n\nprosecution contended that Salam had actually gone to the flat to jointly deal with the\n\ndrugs with Suboh and to take delivery of the drugs as contained the blue plastic bag from\n\nthe 3rdaccused. It was not a case of innocent association with Salam. When\n\nthey left the flat, they were on their way for their drug trafficking rounds when they\n\nwere arrested.Defence of 2ndaccused183.    In his\n\ndefence, Suboh testified that he received a telephone call from Salam at about 1 p.m. on\n\n22 December 1999. Salam asked him if he wanted to sell VCDs. Suboh accepted his offer.\n\nSalam then asked him to go to Hazafi’s flat and to whistle to him upon his arrival.\n\nWhen Suboh reached the flat, he whistled to Salam, who then opened the door and invited\n\nSuboh in. In the flat, Salam showed Suboh a plastic bag with about 20 VCDs inside. He\n\ncould not remember the titles except for one which was ‘Kama Sutra’.184.    Suboh saw small\n\nsachets of drugs in the plastic bag. When he asked Salam whom they belonged to, Salam\n\nreplied that he did not know. Salam told him that the plastic bag was given to him by\n\nsomeone earlier. Suboh wanted to take some sachets for himself but Salam objected.\n\nNevertheless Suboh took some of it for his own use.185.    Thereafter,\n\nhe felt a need to move his bowels and he went to the toilet for about 20 minutes. He\n\nsmoked two cigarettes. After leaving the toilet, he came out into the hall and spent some\n\ntime talking with Salam. He did not see the plastic bag with the VCDs and drugs again.186.    Thereafter,\n\nSalam opened the padlock of the gate with the key he had with him. He left the key in\n\npadlock and two other keys attached. He told Suboh to lock up after him. Salam did not\n\nwait for Suboh but walked ahead. Suboh locked the padlock and kept the 3 keys with him and\n\nwent after Salam, who by that time had climbed the staircase to the 4thfloor.\n\nSuboh managed to catch up with Salam at the lift landing on the 6thfloor. He\n\nintended to return the keys to Salam. Before he could do so, they were arrested when they\n\nemerged from the lift at the ground level.187.    Suboh\n\ndenied knowledge of the drugs. He did not know the 3rdaccused and never saw\n\nhim that day. Suboh however admitted to possession of the 10 sachets for the purpose of\n\ntrafficking.188.    He denied\n\nthat Hazafi had ever given the keys to the flat to him. He testified that he never had\n\npossession of the keys to the flat. In the course of the trial, all the 3 keys seized as a\n\nbunch from Suboh at the time of arrest were tested on my instructions. It was discovered\n\nthat one key opened the front gate of Hazafi’s father’s flat. Due to this fresh\n\nevidence, Hazafi was recalled. Hazafi reversed his evidence and admitted that he had lied\n\non oath earlier in his testimony in Court and in his statement given at the Preliminary\n\nInquiry, which was admitted into evidence. He testified that he had in fact given the keys\n\nto the flat to Suboh because Suboh wanted a place to stay. He said that the key to his\n\nfather’s flat was accidentally given when he took out the 2 other keys to give to\n\nSuboh.189.    Counsel submitted\n\nthat Hazafi’s evidence was suspect because the flat, being so dirty and untidy, was\n\nunliveable. Further it was not likely that Hazafi would permit Suboh to keep the key to\n\nhis father’s flat. Suboh’s evidence was that Hazafi had known him and Salam\n\nwhile they were serving detention at Changi Prison. Counsel submitted that Hazafi gave the\n\nkeys to Salam. However, Hazafi denied knowing Salam at all. On this, Hazafi never\n\nvacillated. He said that he knew Suboh. Suboh had even visited him at the said flat on 3\n\nprevious occasions. This was not disputed by Suboh. To me, this clearly showed that Hazafi\n\nwas on fairly good terms with Suboh, which was consistent with his evidence that he had\n\nallowed Suboh the use of the said flat.190.    Counsel\n\nsuggested that Salam and Hazafi had a nefarious connection with each other involving the\n\nuse of the flat. That was why they denied knowing each other. He relied on the evasive\n\nreplies given by Hazafi that he could not remember having been detained together with\n\nSalam at Orchard Road in November 1999, which was what Salam had told Suboh. Had Salam not\n\nknown Hazafi, Salam would not have been able to tell him about that incident. Salam\n\nadmitted that he was arrested at Far East Plaza and was taken to Tanglin Police Station\n\nbut he denied that he was with Hazafi or that he told Suboh about this incident.191.    Counsel\n\nchallenged Salam’s defence that he had not been to the flat before. He tried to\n\nestablish that it was Salam and not Suboh who had the keys and was using the flat for his\n\ndrug activities. He submitted that Salam had given false statements to the CNB officers\n\nthat Suboh was in the flat before he arrived there. After becoming aware of the\n\nobservations of the CNB officers, he fabricated another account in his oral evidence to\n\ncontinue pushing the responsibility for the drugs to Suboh.192.    Counsel\n\ncontended that Suboh had consistently denied that he had anything to do with the flat. The\n\nfact that a pair of unidentified slippers were found outside the flat, and three\n\nunidentified persons were seen entering the flat about a week before gave rise to a\n\nreasonable doubt whether Suboh had possession of the drugs in question because other\n\npersons did have access to the flat.193.    It was\n\nfurther submitted that no adverse influence could be brought against Suboh for not saying\n\nanything in his defence in his S 122(6) statement because he was tired, his head was\n\ninjured and the statement was taken about 1.30 a.m. in the morning.Defence of 3rdaccused194.    Although\n\nthe 3rdaccused elected to remain silent, witnesses were called on his behalf\n\nto cast doubt on the evidence of the surveillance officers, W/Sgt Rahizah and SSgt\n\nSubramaniam that they saw the 3rdaccused walk along the 6thfloor\n\ncommon corridor, and then down to the 3rdfloor where he stopped for a while\n\noutside unit #03-37, and then up again to the 6thfloor back to where he came\n\nfrom. The CNB surveillance officers admitted that they could not determine the gender or\n\nthe race of the person who eventually stood outside the unit for a while.195.    Counsel\n\nhighlighted that both SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah relied on their\n\n‘instinct’ to conclude that it was the driver of JDF 755 who stood outside the\n\nunit for a while on that day in question. Hence, their evidence was unreliable.196.    Counsel\n\nsubmitted that SSgt Goh and Sgt Tony Ng had a clear view of #03-37 from their observation\n\nposition. Their failure to steal a glance at #03-37 meant that there were no radio\n\nmessages alerting them that ‘someone was walking along the 6thfloor’or ‘the male Chinese is standing outside unit #03-37’.\n\nOtherwise, they would have looked at the unit which they did not.197.    I did not\n\nagree because there was sufficient corroborative evidence from other CNB officers that\n\nthey did hear the message.198.    If SSgt Goh\n\nand Sgt Tony Ng had said that they kept a close watch at #03-37 and yet they never saw the\n\n3rdaccused stop at #03-37, then counsel would be correct that the evidence of\n\nSSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah was unreliable. But if they had not in fact kept watch\n\nof the unit, then it would not follow that their failure to see the 3rdaccused\n\nstanding outside the unit would necessarily cast doubt on the evidence of SSgt Subramaniam\n\nand W/Sgt Rahizah. In a large operation, each team would naturally have its own function\n\nto perform.199.    What was\n\nclear was that SSgt Subramaniam’s and W/Sgt Rahizah’s observations of Suboh and\n\nSalam taking the lift to the 6thfloor, walking along the 6thfloor\n\ncommon corridor and coming down to the 3rdfloor and then entering the flat\n\nwere accurate. Suboh and Salam never challenged that what the surveillance officers saw\n\nwas not what they did. Their testimony in court confirmed the accuracy of the surveillance\n\nof these two officers. If they could not see Salam and Suboh leave the flat and proceed to\n\nthe lift on the 6thfloor, then how could the CNB officers be mobilised to wait\n\nfor them right outside the lift landing on the ground floor just in time to make the\n\narrests.200.    In my mind,\n\nit adequately demonstrated that the surveillance officers could observe the movements\n\nreliably of persons moving from the 6thfloor common corridor to the 3rdfloor flat via the staircase and vice versa. There would of course be instances where the\n\nsubject could not be seen and then could be seen again in particular as they climbed the\n\nstaircase. Based on their experience, they would be able to track the subject although\n\nthere might be instances when they lose direct sight of the subject but they could pick up\n\nthe movement or trail again when the subject reappeared. This would not be difficult at\n\nall in my view since it was in the afternoon on a working day and thus, the place was\n\nrelatively quiet at that time.201.    The defence\n\ncalled Mr Yoha Anantha to testify that the view from the car park lot where the\n\nsurveillance officers kept observation from was obstructed by the trees. The unit #03-37\n\nand the staircase leading thereto could not be seen because a particular vertical\n\nsub-branch of a tree (Tree B nearest to Block 489 at exhibit D 23) was obstructing the\n\nview.202.    The\n\nhorticultural contractor for Jurong West, Mr Kwek Swee Hin, testified that in February\n\n1999, those trees were pruned to reduce their height. Prior to that, they were about 4 to\n\n5 storeys high. However, that vertical sub-branch in question was not cut. Mr Wong Yew\n\nKwan, a consultant horticulturist and the former Commissioner of Parks and Recreation\n\nDepartment and Director of Botanic Gardens, after examining the tree in question,\n\ntestified that the vertical sub-branch would have been there in December 1999. He said\n\nhowever that it was likely that it might be shorter and its bushy base could also have\n\nbeen lower in December 1999 than on 8 August 2000, when the photographs were taken to show\n\nthe obstructed view.203.    As for the\n\ntaller tree (Tree B nearer Block 487 at exhibit D23) that was obstructing a part of the\n\nview of 6th floor corridor, it would appear from the evidence that it was not likely for\n\nthis tree to have obstructed the view for any significant length of the 6th floor corridor\n\nin December 1999. In my judgment, a surveillance officer could easily track the subject\n\nalong the 6th floor corridor even if a small section was obstructed because the person\n\nwould be seen disappearing and then reappearing as he walked along the corridor.Statement of 3rdaccused204.    Counsel\n\nrelied on Suboh’s statement to the CNB that he was on the 6thfloor\n\ncorridor, where he handed over his blue plastic bag to the person at the 6thfloor lift landing. Prior to that, he was seen talking on his mobile phone at the void\n\ndeck. He submitted that the phone call was not traced to the mobile phone of Suboh. The 1staccused had a mobile phone but it was not working. Hence, counsel submitted that the 3rdaccused did not contact either the 1stor 2ndaccused persons when\n\nhe arrived at Blk 489. The person he telephoned was traced by the CNB but was not called\n\nby the prosecution to testify.205.    Counsel\n\nsurmised that the 3rdaccused gave a blue plastic bag to this person. The blue\n\nplastic bag he was seen carrying was a common bag that could be purchased in Johore Bahru\n\nMalaysia. During a search of the flat on 11 August 2000, there were 3 similar blue bags\n\nfound inside. In the flat was another green bag identical to the green bag found to\n\ncontain the drugs. This suggested that the green bag and blue bag containing the drugs\n\ncould not with any certainty be said to have come from him.206.    Counsel\n\nsubmitted that it could not be reasonably inferred from his statements that he had\n\ndelivered drugs to the flat. Throughout his statements, he consistently maintained his\n\nstand that he never went to the flat. He had only passed the blue plastic bag he was\n\ncarrying to a male Malay on the 6thfloor lift landing. The accused had\n\nmaintained his stand that he never delivered any blue plastic bag to any person at the\n\nsaid flat on the 3rdfloor.207.    It was\n\npostulated that the flat could perhaps even be a drug den and be used to store drugs as 3\n\npersons were seen entering the flat by a neighbour sometime in December 1999, after the\n\nDolwahabs had moved out. The 3 persons could not be identified. It was submitted that the\n\ndrugs could have been there long before 22 December 1999. As such, the circumstantial\n\nevidence did not lead inevitably and inexorably to one and only one conclusion that the\n\ndrugs were delivered by the 3rdaccused to the flat. Other probable\n\npermutations existed as well.208.    Counsel\n\nemphasized that the 3rdaccused was not apprehended carrying drugs on his\n\nperson. Neither were his fingerprints found on the bags containing the drugs. Salam and\n\nSuboh had not implicated him at all.My Findings(a) 1staccused209.    Salam was not found\n\nin possession of the keys to the flat. The keys were found instead on Suboh. Most of the\n\nmembers of the Dolwahab family including Hazafi testified that Salam was not known to\n\nthem. Hazafi knew Suboh and Hazafi later confessed that he gave the flat keys to Suboh.\n\nThus, it was Suboh and not Salam who had lied about the keys.210.    I believed\n\nSalam that he did not have the keys to the flat and that he had never been to the flat\n\nbefore. If he had been there before, he would probably have directed the taxi driver to\n\ndrive straight into the car park of Blk 489 as was the case with Suboh. The taxi which\n\nbrought him there in fact stopped some distance away from Blk 489 at Jurong West St 41.\n\nFurther, I observed that the route (exhibit D1) he took after buying the soya bean drinks\n\nat Blk 486 was not diagonally across the car park and directly to Blk 489. Instead he\n\nwalked to the opposite Blk 487 where he said he looked across to Blk 489 to locate the\n\ncupboard outside the flat as described by Suboh. The indirect route taken appeared to be\n\nmore consistent with unfamiliarity than familiarity with where the flat was located.211.    The empty\n\ncan of soya bean drink, old newspapers and some antique cups/bowls found in the subsequent\n\njoint inspection of the master bedroom of the flat, confirmed important features of\n\nSalam’s account that he was resting in the master bedroom, smoking cigarettes to\n\nprolong the high feeling after having taken a straw of heroin before going to the flat.\n\nWhen he was in the master bedroom, Suboh told him to rest as he had something to attend\n\nto. Suboh then closed the master bedroom door. In my judgment, it was at this time that\n\nthe 3rdaccused delivered the blue plastic bag of drugs to Suboh. It was not\n\nlikely therefore for Salam to be aware of the drug delivery.212.    Salam was\n\nrecently released from prison. He was looking for a job. The important question was\n\nwhether he was looking for a legitimate job or was he looking for a ‘drug\n\ntrafficking’ job, or was he already by that time involved with Suboh trafficking in\n\ndrugs.213.    Salam\n\ntestified that he bought 2 straws of heroin. If he was already a drug trafficker, I could\n\nnot see any reason why he should have to buy straws of heroin from other traffickers when\n\nhe himself would have ample supply of straws himself. It did not make sense to me.214.    Salam\n\nappeared to be short of money. He did not even have a working handphone or a pager with\n\nhim. Again, this did not quite fit the profile of a trafficker. A trafficker would need\n\nthe means of communication to enable his clients to contact him. I did not think that he\n\nwould distribute his mother’s home telephone number to his clients. That he was short\n\nof money indicated at least to me that, if he was a trafficker, he was not a successful\n\none. More likely, he was not a trafficker or not a trafficker yet.215.    At the time\n\nof arrest, 10 sachets were found on Suboh. It was significant that none was found on\n\nSalam. Salam did not know Suboh that well. With a longer period of association with Suboh\n\nand if Salam were not to find a legitimate job soon enough, Salam might well be sucked\n\ninto the lucrative drug trafficking business, given the fact that Salam was already back\n\nto consuming heroin about 3 months after his release from prison.216.    However, I\n\nwas inclined to think that at the time of his arrest, Suboh might not have trusted Salam\n\nwell enough to let Salam into his trafficking activities which Suboh probably operated\n\nfrom the flat. As such, Salam was not involved yet. But the law in this case does not\n\npunish a person for what he might do in the future. Thus, however likely it might be for a\n\njobless Salam to be involved in the future with Suboh in drug trafficking to support an\n\nexpensive heroin addiction, it was altogether irrelevant.217.    Although\n\nSalam retracted a number of his statements to the CNB officers after his arrest which\n\nshowed him to be a self-confessed liar, nevertheless I was prepared to accept his evidence\n\ngiven at the trial proper after I had carefully scrutinised his evidence. He appeared\n\nfairly forthright and candid. I was to some extent impressed by the consistency of his\n\nevidence not only on a general level but also in the details despite being tested quite\n\nseverely in cross-examination by counsel for Suboh and by the DPP. He came out\n\nsurprisingly well. I was surprised at his candour about his past which he revealed without\n\nhesitation during cross-examination by counsel for Suboh. In any event, it did not\n\nprejudice him. I reminded myself that a convicted criminal can reform his ways. What was\n\nmost important was whether he did or did not traffick at that time in the drugs seized.\n\nOne should not conclude on the basis of past drug trafficking activities that he must\n\ntherefore be trafficking in drugs again.218.    I tested\n\nhis evidence against the objective evidence. I was fully conscious of the fact that an\n\naccused person might want to tailor his evidence to fit the objective facts as closely as\n\npossible to give it a veneer of believability, sufficient to raise at least a reasonable\n\ndoubt. Much as I would like to think that there was a lurking suspicion that he might well\n\nbe involved based on the circumstantial evidence, I did not think that it was sufficient\n\nfor to me to convict Salam on the criminal charge based on a high standard of proof of\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt. The circumstantial evidence did not point irresistibly to the\n\nconclusion that he had a common intention to traffick in the said drugs together with\n\nSuboh. As would be seen later, I found that the prosecution succeeded only to a limited\n\nextent in proving that Suboh was involved with the trafficking but not Salam. Suboh was a\n\nsole operator in this case and there was a reasonable doubt in my mind that Suboh had\n\nalready gotten Salam involved in his drug trafficking enterprise, or that he was prepared\n\nat that meeting on 22 December 1999, to allow Salam to participate.219.    In my mind,\n\nSuboh might well be planning to rope Salam in. Having regard to the particular\n\ncircumstances of Salam at that time, I would not be surprised if Salam would be delighted\n\nat the opportunity to assist and earn some money. But the arrest in my mind probably\n\noccurred before that stage was reached. If they had not been arrested, it might well be\n\nthat Salam would have seen what Suboh was going to do with the 10 sachets, but that would\n\nnot be relevant.220.    \n\nAccordingly, I acquitted and discharged the accused as the prosecution had failed to prove\n\nthe charge against the 1staccused beyond reasonable doubt.(b) 2ndaccused221.    Suboh was\n\nreleased from the Reformative Training Centre in February 1998. He was arrested again in\n\nNovember 1998 and released in May 1999. Suboh could not give a proper history of his\n\nemployment when he was not in prison and how he was able to support his cannabis and\n\necstasy consumption.222.    Suboh\n\ntestified that he was not close to Salam. Suboh admitted that he had to stay away from his\n\nresidence on occasions to avoid being arrested by the Police for some outstanding matters\n\nwith the Clementi Police Division HQ.223.    In his\n\nstatement, Suboh said that he had never been to the flat before. However, Hazafie\n\nconfessed that he had handed over the key to Suboh sometime in November 1999 when Suboh\n\nasked him to allow him to stay in the flat. I believed Hazafie. The fact that the keys to\n\nthe flat were found on Suboh and not Salam confirmed what Hazafie had said.224.    \n\nSuboh’s story that he grabbed the 10 sachets for his own consumption from a plastic\n\nbag containing VCDs which Salam showed to him in the flat was unbelievable. Having been\n\narrested with the 10 sachets in his trouser pockets on his way out, which would be beyond\n\nwhat would normally be required for self-consumption for a day, Suboh had no alternative\n\nbut to confess to trafficking in them in his evidence-in-chief in court. In fact, his own\n\ncounsel referred to his s 122 (6) statement given in relation to the charge of trafficking\n\nin the 10 sachets found on him, wherein he admitted to the charge and pleaded for\n\nleniency.225.    In my\n\nopinion, Suboh was faced with no alternative but to concoct a story as to how he got hold\n\nof these 10 sachets from the flat, without being associated with the other packets of\n\ndrugs found there. Thus he fabricated a story that Salam showed him a bag of VCDs\n\ncontaining drugs, which suggested that Suboh was entirely responsible for the drugs found\n\nin the flat. I rejected his story. No VCDs were found in the flat when the CNB officers\n\nsearched the flat. Neither were there VCDs found at the subsequent joint inspection on 11\n\nAugust 2000 by the parties. Only an empty VCD/music cellophane wrapper was found on top of\n\nthe cupboard seen in photograph P6.226.    I further drew an\n\nadverse inference against him that he was not at all involved with the drugs, when he\n\ndeclined to state any defence whatsoever, when invited to do so in his s 122(6) cautioned\n\nstatement, wherein he said \"I have nothing to say right now.\"227.    Suboh had a\n\nworking handphone and a pager. Clients could therefore readily contact him. He had the\n\nkeys to the flat. I inferred that he was using the flat as his base for drug trafficking\n\nactivities from the time that Hazafi had given him the keys. He was clearly going for his\n\ndrug trafficking rounds when he was caught with the 10 sachets.228.    He could\n\nnot give a reasonable account of what he did in the flat from 2.05 pm to 3.20 pm. By his\n\nown evidence, he saw the sachets of drugs before he went inside the toilet for some 20\n\nminutes. He testified that apart from the time spent in the toilet, he was in the hall of\n\nthe flat. If the drugs were delivered at the time he was in the toilet, then he would not\n\nhave seen any drugs prior to his going to the toilet. By that evidence, it suggested that\n\nhe was present in the hall at the time the 3rdaccused delivered the drugs. The\n\nirresistible conclusion was that he and not Salam took delivery of the blue plastic bag\n\nwith the drugs. It was he who had, whilst Salam was resting in the master bedroom,\n\nrepacked some of the drugs into the sachets, which accounted for the empty torn plastic\n\nbag (stained with heroin) and the cellophane wrapper found in the kitchen (which was\n\nsimilar to that used for wrapping the other packets of drugs). After repacking, he then\n\nplaced 10 sachets in his pockets to get ready for his trafficking rounds. Thereafter, he\n\nhid the blue plastic bag containing the drugs and the other drug trafficking paraphernalia\n\nbehind the cupboard in the flat. There was no reliable evidence to show that Salam knew\n\nabout this hidden blue plastic bag.229.    In my judgment,\n\nSuboh had physical possession of the drugs in the flat as well as the requisite mens rea\n\nfor trafficking.S 17 of the Misuse of Drugs Act Cap 185\n\n  states:Any person who is proved to have had in\n\n  his possession more thana) …b) ….c) 2 grams of diamorphinebe presumed to have had the drug in his\n\n  possession for the purpose of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that\n\n  drug was not for that purpose.230.    The 2ndaccused failed to adduce any reliable evidence to rebut the presumption against him.231.    \n\nAccordingly, the prosecution proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he had trafficked in\n\nthe drugs. I amended the charge that he trafficked alone in the drugs and I convicted him\n\non the amended charge.(c) 3rdaccused232.    The 3rdaccused remained silent. At the end of the trial, I had to consider his s 122(1) statement\n\nwhich was inculpatory in certain parts and exculpatory in other parts. In considering a\n\nmixed statement such as this, I applied the approach stated inChan Kim Choi v Public\n\nProsecutor[1991] SLR 34where Lai Kew Chai J said:The House of Lords answered the question\n\n  by ruling that the whole statement constituted evidence of the truth of the facts it\n\n  asserted and the judge should have directed the jury that both the incriminating parts and\n\n  the excuses or explanations must be considered in determining where the truth lies,\n\n  although where appropriate, as it usually would be, the judge might, and should have,\n\n  pointed out that the incriminating parts were likely to be true whereas the excuses did\n\n  not carry the same weight. …In our considered view, the law in Singapore in relation\n\n  to the evidential status of mixed statements admitted under s 122(5) of the CPC is\n\n  precisely the same.233.    Tee Chee Seong\n\ntestified that he had on that day loaned him a sum of $20,000, which was in small\n\ndenominations and with no $1000 notes. At the time of his arrest, he had a total of\n\n$34,450. There were seven $1000 bills. Where did the balance sum of $14,450 come from? I\n\ninferred that a substantial part of that must have been given to him in exchange for the\n\nblue plastic bag. Whatever was there in the blue plastic bag was worth quite a lot of\n\nmoney. What could that be?234.    Based on\n\nthe exculpatory parts of his s 121 statement, that he only delivered a blue bag to someone\n\nwho met him at the 6thfloor lift landing but not to someone in the flat on the\n\n3rdfloor, counsel submitted that he ought to be acquitted. I could not ascribe\n\nmuch weight to these exculpatory parts for the following reasons.235.    After\n\ncareful evaluation, I did not think those exculpatory parts were true that he did not go\n\nto the flat on the 3rdfloor to deliver the blue plastic bag. No one was called\n\nto testify on behalf of the 3rdaccused that he took delivery on the 6thfloor of a blue plastic bag from the accused, which contained something which was not\n\ndrugs but was some ‘yellow substance’.236.    His refusal\n\nto testify and be subjected to cross-examination did not help his defence at all. On the\n\ncontrary, it lent credence to what the surveillance officers saw. I found it most unlikely\n\nthat there were apparently two things co-incidentally happening: a different man seen\n\nappearing outside the flat at the 3rdfloor at about the same time that the 3rdaccused was purportedly delivering a blue plastic bag containing something illegal to\n\nanother male Malay on the 6thfloor, which no one else saw. I drew an adverse\n\ninference against the 3rdaccused under s 196(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\n(Cap 78) of that co-incidence happening.237.    There was\n\nample credible evidence from SSgt Subramaniam and W/Sgt Rahizah and the surveillance team,\n\nsupported by evidence of contemporaneous radio message communications, that the driver of\n\nJDF 755 had indeed gone up to the 6thfloor of the Blk 489 via the lift, walked\n\nalong the common corridor, walked down the stairs to the 3rdfloor, stood\n\noutside the said flat and later leaving the way he came from. He was seen carrying a blue\n\nplastic bag when he went up the lift and later, he was no longer seen with the blue\n\nplastic bag when he returned to his car. The totality of the surveillance evidence led me\n\nto the inexorable conclusion that the 3rdaccused had delivered a blue plastic\n\nbag to a person at the said flat on the 3rdfloor.238.    I must\n\nemphasize that the prosecution’s case against the 3rdaccused was not\n\nentirely based on this surveillance evidence alone but was corroborated by the inculpatory\n\nparts of the 3rdaccused’s s 121 statement.239.    The 3rdaccused\n\nhad confessed in substance to the following :(a) ‘Ah Bear’ had previously asked him to carry\n\n  packets of items into Singapore. He had done so and was paid. He made these deliveries\n\n  because he was short of money.(b) On the eve of his arrest ‘Ah Bear’ asked him\n\n  again to make delivery of items into Singapore. Ah Bear handed ablue plastic bagto him. He did not know thenumber of packetsinside. ‘Ah Bear’ told him\n\n  tocollect moneyfrom the person he was handing the blue plastic bag over.(c) On the day of his arrest, he hid the plastic bag under\n\n  the spare tyre in the boot of his car JDF 755. He believed that the things he carried wereillegalas ‘Ah Bear’ had previously told him to hide them well. But he\n\n  never thought that he would face the death penalty if arrested.(d) When he was at Ang Mo Kio, he removed the blue plastic\n\n  bag and transferred it to the floorboard of the rear passenger seat. He saw about one to\n\n  two packets ofyellow substanceinside the bag. He called a number provided\n\n  subsequently by ‘Ah Bear’ and the male Malay told him that he was at Blk 489\n\n  Jurong West.(e) Upon reaching Blk 489, he called the male Malay again\n\n  and was told to go to the 6th storey. He went to the 6th story where hemet a male\n\n  Malay, andhanded the blue plastic to himand collected a brown envelope\n\n  containing money from him.(f) He was shown the blue plastic bag\n\n  seized and he recognised andidentified it as the blue plastic bagmentioned in his\n\n  statement which he said he was carrying when he went up the lift of Blk 489.240.    Much was\n\nmade of the fact by the defence that the handphone no. 979916901 traced on the 3rdaccused’s handphone was not traced to the handphone of Suboh. The person traced to\n\nthat handphone number was not called to give evidence by either side. There was no\n\nevidence as to the time of the call and whether that call was indeed the same call he was\n\nseen making when he arrived at Blk 489. In my view, the existence of the call per se was\n\ninsufficient to raise a reasonable doubt in the prosecution’s case that the accused\n\ndid deliver a blue plastic bag of drugs to the said flat.241.    The defence\n\nproduced photographs of the scene taken about half a year after the arrest to show that\n\nthe view of the surveillance officers were blocked by trees. Hence, it was submitted that\n\nSSgt Subramanian and W/Sgt Rahizah did not see the 3rdaccused go to the flat.\n\nI noted that the high contrast in the photographs would give the wrong impression that the\n\nfeatures under a shadow would not be discernable with the naked eye. The photographer\n\nadmitted that the photos D7(1) – (26) were taken when the sky was overcast and it was\n\ndrizzling. The surveillance by the CNB officers on the other hand was done on a bright\n\nsunny day in the afternoon. Hence, the photographs would not reflect or reproduce the\n\nvisual clarity that the surveillance officers had.242.    I accepted\n\nthe prosecution’s submission that Mr Kwek was not able to describe the state and size\n\nof the trees as in December 1999. Photographs D7 (No: 32 and 34) in any case appeared to\n\nshow that the line of sight from the car park at which observation was kept to the flat\n\nwas not completely obstructed. Further, the view of the 6thfloor common\n\ncorridor at Blk 489 would not be obstructed based on the height estimation provided Mr\n\nWong, which was marked on Exhibit D7 (No 7).243.    I could not\n\nplace much weight on the testimony of the defence witnesses called in relation to the\n\nobstruction of the surveillance officers’ view. They were not there at the time of\n\nthe incident. They did not see the actual state of the vertical sub-branch, the main\n\nbranches and the density of the foliage of the trees. Although Mr Wong could say that the\n\nsub-branch was there and had never been cut, he could not say how dense the foliage of the\n\nbranches were on the day in question.244.    The\n\ntestimony of the CNB surveillance officers was that the foliage of the trees was much less\n\ndense and their view was not obstructed at that time.I accepted the testimony of\n\nthe surveillance officers that they did see the 3rdaccused at the door step of\n\nthe said flat. They were sufficiently experienced surveillance officers who did track the\n\nmovement of the 3rdaccused from the common corridor to the flat although there\n\nwould be instances where they lost sight of him as he was descending and ascending the\n\nstaircase. Being an afternoon on a working day, I accepted the evidence of the CNB\n\nsurveillance officers that the place was rather deserted. As such, it would be most\n\nunlikely for the surveillance officers to confuse the 3rdaccused with another\n\nperson who happened to be around the vicinity of the 6thfloor and 3rdfloor at that time at Blk 489.245.    Based on\n\nthe totality of the evidence, I found that the prosecution had proved beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt that the 3rdaccused had delivered the seized drugs in the blue plastic\n\nbag to Suboh at the flat on the 3rdfloor of Blk 489. Accordingly, I convicted\n\nthe 3rdaccused on an amended charge of delivery of 165.67 grams of diamorphine\n\nto Suboh.Chan Seng OnnJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
