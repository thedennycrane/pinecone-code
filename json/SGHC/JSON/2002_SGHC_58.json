        "The Charge": "The appellant, Ang Kah Kee,\n\nwas charged in the magistrate’s court with the following offence:You,ANG KAH KEE, M/33 YRSNRIC NO. S1831029-Eare charged that you on the 20thday of April 2000 at or\n\n  about 10.00 p.m., at Block 122 Bishan Street 12 #05-39, Singapore, did voluntarily cause\n\n  hurt to one Umi Kulsum binti Nurudin, who was then employed as a domestic maid in your\n\n  household, to wit by punching her right eye, resulting in a right periorbital bruise, and\n\n  you have thereby committed an offence under Section 323 of the Penal Code, Chapter 224.2 Ang was found guilty of the charge and sentenced to three\n\nmonths’ imprisonment. He appealed against conviction and sentence and also filed an\n\napplication to adduce fresh expert evidence. The matter came up before me on 26 February\n\n2002. I denied the criminal motion but allowed the appeal against conviction and sentence.\n\nMy grounds for doing so are set out below.",
        "The facts": "3 The complainant, Umi Kulsum binti Nurudin (\"Umi\"), was an\n\nIndonesian national who had come to Singapore to work. On 15 April 2000, some five days\n\nbefore the alleged offence took place, she commenced her employment in Ang’s\n\nhousehold as a domestic maid. Ang’s wife, Serene Eng Choo Hwee (Mdm Eng), was\n\nUmi’s employer. Umi had difficulty with the English language and would communicate\n\nwith her employers in a mixture of English and sign language.4 During her short work stint, Umi spent most of her time at the home\n\nof Mdm Eng’s parents since Ang and his wife would leave their two children in the\n\ncare of Mdm Eng’s parents during the week days while they worked.5 On 20 April 2000, Ang and Mdm Eng brought Umi and their son back to\n\ntheir flat in Bishan as the next day was Good Friday, a public holiday. Umi set about\n\ndoing the housework as instructed. One of her tasks was to mop the floor in the living\n\nroom. All this while, Ang was sitting on the living room sofa watching television and\n\nreading newspapers.6 What happened after this was a matter of dispute. According to Umi,\n\nthe couple’s baby son was in the bedroom with Mdm Eng. When Ang heard the cries of\n\nthe baby, he instructed Umi to bring him out into the living room. Umi complied, but upon\n\nbeing told by Mdm Eng that she could manage the child on her own, Umi left the bedroom\n\nempty-handed and returned to her former task of mopping the living room floor.7 Ang raised his voice at Umi for failing to obey his previous\n\ninstructions when he continued to hear the baby’s crying. According to Umi, he told\n\nher in a loud voice to bring the baby into the living room. Umi brought the baby boy out\n\nas ordered and placed him on the floor. Moments later, the child started to play with the\n\ndirty water in the pail that Umi was using to mop the floor. Ang shouted at Umi when he\n\nsaw this. Umi quickly carried the child away from the pail and back into the bedroom.8 As Umi returned to mop the floor, Ang allegedly began to chastise her\n\nfor working slowly and for being inept in looking after children. He walked over to Umi,\n\nrepeated his complaint and then allegedly punched her once in the right eye.9 Umi did not cry out even though the punch had hurt her. Instead, she\n\ncarried on mopping the rest of the floor. After she had finished her task, she took a\n\nshower, at which point she noticed that there was a bruise below her right eye.\n\nThereafter, Umi went to bed.10 Ang and Mdm Eng gave a different version of events. According to the\n\nduo, their child was in the living room with Ang while Mdm Eng was taking a shower in the\n\nbedroom toilet. Umi was instructed to mop the living room floor at around 10 p.m. as it\n\nwas dusty and the baby was in the house.11 Whilst he was in the midst of watching television and reading\n\nnewspapers, Ang heard splashing noises and realised that his son was playing with the\n\ndirty water in the pail that Umi was using to mop the floor. He then said \"Hey! Hey!\n\nBerhenti, baby tak boleh kacau water.\" However, he did not raise his voice. Umi\n\nimmediately carried the baby away from the pail. Mdm Eng then emerged from the bedroom to\n\nbring the baby in.12 Soon after, Ang heard the baby crying in the bedroom, whereupon he\n\ninstructed the maid to lend his wife a hand. Umi did so, but was told by Mdm Eng that she\n\ncould manage on her own. Umi emerged from the bedroom and returned to her own room.13 Mdm Eng came out of the bedroom into the living room. She informed\n\nAng that she could look after the child by herself. Mdm. Eng told the Court that, up till\n\nthat point in time, she had not noticed any injuries on Umi. Ang continued to read his\n\nnewspapers and watch television until he turned in for the night at about 11 p.m.14 Notwithstanding the different versions of what had happened on 20\n\nApril 2000, the events of the early hours of 21 April 2000 were not in dispute.15 At approximately 3:30 a.m., some five and a half hours after the\n\noffence allegedly took place, Umi woke up and was determined to escape from the flat.\n\nAccording to her, she was gripped by fear that she would be hit again and felt that she\n\nhad to flee from the flat immediately. She packed some belongings, including a pair of\n\npants, a comb, a mirror and her purse, into a bag.16 As she did not possess a set of keys to the front door, Umi felt\n\nthat the only way to escape was through the fifth storey window of the flat. Under the\n\ncover of darkness, she climbed out of the window, with the aid of a chair, and hung onto\n\nthe metal pipes normally used to hold the drying poles. She could not see what was\n\ndirectly below her. After suspending herself in this manner, Umi let go and fell some 13\n\nmetres onto the ground below. She told the Court that she had no recollection whatsoever\n\nof the manner in which she landed. She could also not remember whether she had hit\n\nanything in the course of falling.17 Umi got onto her feet in a semi-conscious state and realised that\n\nshe was bleeding from her injuries. She started to walk aimlessly. At around 6 a.m., while\n\non his way to work, one Mohammed Salleh bin Mohamed Arshad (Mr Salleh) saw Umi wandering\n\nabout in a daze. This was at the foot of Block 222 Toa Payoh, a distance away from where\n\nUmi had fallen. He noticed that she was bleeding from her head, her tee-shirt was bloody,\n\nher legs were swollen and there was a greenish bruise on her face. She also had cuts on\n\nboth her hands and the nail of her big toe had come off.18 Umi approached Mr Salleh for help, saying that she was in pain and\n\nthat she was hungry. Judging from her bleeding head and swollen legs, Mr Salleh asked if\n\nshe had been assaulted. Umi denied it and said that her injuries were due to an accident.\n\nMr Salleh then brought Umi to the nearby market at Block 212 Toa Payoh for some food and\n\ndrink. There, he pressed her for more information, asking her for the identity of her\n\nassailants. According to Mr Salleh, Umi refused to say anything as she was afraid. All he\n\nknew was that she was hungry. At one point, Umi went to the toilet in the market to change\n\ninto the fresh pair of pants that she had brought with her.19 After eating, Umi told Mr Salleh that she wanted to follow him. She\n\nwas taken to his nephew’s flat in Block 221 Toa Payoh. Mr Salleh then left for work\n\nwhile Umi slept for much of the day on the sofa. Also in the flat for the whole day were\n\nthe owner, Juma’at bin Mohamed Nasir (Mr Juma’at), and his brother, Jumari bin\n\nMohamed Nasir (Mr Jumari). Neither attempted to speak to Umi to find out what had happened\n\nto her.20 In the meantime, after Ang and Mdm Eng had awoken, they realised\n\nthat Umi was missing from the flat. After a fruitless search of the vicinity, Mdm. Eng\n\nmade a police report at about 10:10 a.m.21 At 3:00 p.m., Mr Salleh returned to his nephew’s flat for a\n\nshort while during which he applied medicated oil to Umi’s swollen legs. He met Mr\n\nJumari and told him that he had found her at the market.22 At around 6:00 p.m. the same day, Mr Juma’at’s wife,\n\nLatifah binte Haji Hassan (Mdm Latifah), as well as Mr Jumari’s girlfriend, Hajar\n\nbinte Abdul Rahman alias Siti (Siti), returned to the flat. Mr Salleh returned from work\n\nshortly thereafter. The ladies offered Umi some food. In the kitchen, Mdm Latifah and Siti\n\nasked her if she had been abused. Umi finally revealed that she had been punched by her\n\nemployer. At this point, everyone else in the flat resolved that they should report the\n\nmatter to the police. Siti made the call. They noticed that Umi was crying and was afraid\n\nof being sent back to her employers. The police came and took Umi away with them.",
        "The judge’s decision": "23 Essentially, the judge preferred Umi’s version of what had\n\nhappened on 20 April 2000. In his opinion, Ang’s concern with hygiene, especially\n\nwith regard to his son, was the prime impetus for the attack. His anger was sparked off\n\nwhen he saw his son playing with the dirty water in the pail. This was exacerbated by the\n\nfact that Ang and Mdm Eng had underlying complaints about the speed with which Umi did the\n\ndomestic chores as well as her inexperience in looking after children.24 The judge believed that Ang’s baby son was in the bedroom\n\nrather than in the living room as Ang and Mdm Eng were very concerned about hygiene. It\n\nalso struck him that, if the child was indeed in the living room, Ang would not have been\n\nable to concentrate on watching television and reading the newspapers. According to the\n\njudge, Ang and Mdm Eng had probably cooked up their version in order that Mdm Eng could\n\ntestify that she did not observe any injuries on Umi during the two opportunities that she\n\nhad to observe her that night.25 The judge was of the view that, when Ang heard his son crying in the\n\nbedroom, he probably felt that it would calm him down, if he was taken out of the bedroom\n\ninto the living room. Therefore, when Umi appeared to disobey Ang’s explicit\n\ninstructions, Ang became angry when he heard the child’s persistent crying. As this\n\nwas the first time he was aggressive toward Umi, coupled with the latter’s poor\n\ncommand of English, Umi did not attempt to explain to Ang why she had not complied with\n\nhis instructions.26 According to the judge, everything came to a head when Ang saw his\n\nson playing with the dirty water. This led him to hit Umi. That Umi did not report the\n\nincident to Mdm Eng was, in the judge’s mind, not fatal to the veracity of her story\n\nsince she may have perceived that Mdm Eng would be supportive of her husband.27 The judge also examined other possible reasons advanced by the\n\ndefence that might otherwise explain why Umi would want to escape from the flat. First,\n\nhomesickness was ruled out after he balanced this against Umi’s financial commitments\n\nin coming to Singapore. Secondly, he rejected the possibility that Umi was frustrated with\n\nher meagre earnings as she would only earn $10 a month for the first seven months of\n\nemployment. This was because Umi was aware that she had to pay off her debts to the maid\n\nagency. Thirdly, while Umi, being a Muslim, had a religious aversion to the pet dog\n\nbelonging to Ang’s in-laws, the judge noted that this did not seem to affect her\n\nwork. He found that Ang had cooked up the story about the dog barking and trying to lick\n\nUmi in order to bolster his defence that Umi was unhappy with the presence of the animal\n\nin her workplace. Finally, the judge also rejected the suggestion that Umi might have\n\nplanned her escape with another Indonesian maid. The judge said that this allegation was\n\nnot mentioned in any of Ang’s or Mdm Eng’s written statements to the police.28 All in all, the judge was not convinced that any one of the reasons\n\nventured above could adequately explain why Umi would take the extreme measure of jumping\n\nout of a fifth storey window. In his opinion, something significant must have happened on\n\nthe night of 20 April 2000 to push her to the point of desperation. The judge took the\n\nview that that event must have been the punch. He believed that Umi was, at that time, in\n\ngrave fear for her own safety, as she was afraid of being hit again by Ang. That she did\n\nnot have the house keys also helped to explain what would normally have been considered an\n\nirrational act.29 After assessing the evidence given by the two prosecution expert\n\nwitnesses, Dr Jackie Tan (Dr Tan) and Dr Quah Song Chiek (Dr Quah), the judge held that\n\nthe bruise on Umi’s right eye was consistent with a punch, and was not likely to have\n\nbeen a result of the fall. He accepted the medical evidence that, if the injury had been\n\ninflicted during the fall, its extent would have been more severe, in the sense that more\n\nthan the lamina papyracea would have been fractured, and there would have been other\n\nassociated facial injuries. In this case, the bruise below Umi’s left eye was minor\n\ncompared with that under her right eye.30 The judge noted that Dr Tan had accepted the possibility that\n\nUmi’s rounded knee may have hit her face during the fall. However, he discounted this\n\nin light of Dr Quah’s testimony that such a scenario would have resulted in an injury\n\nmore akin to that of a swollen cheek rather than the bruise that he had seen.31 While Dr Quah admitted that it was possible that Umi’s knee\n\ncould have hit her elbow and then caused her fist to jab her face, the judge found that it\n\nwas unlikely that such a thing could have occurred. Notwithstanding the fact that it was\n\nUmi’s evidence that she had simply let go and fallen straight down, the judge opined\n\nthat Umi must have initially attempted to scale down the wall, but had then fallen on the\n\nprotruding parapet of the ground floor unit and landed on her buttocks, resulting in the\n\nfracture to the pubic ramus. Umi must then have recoiled backwards, causing the\n\nlacerations to the back of her head. Given this finding, the judge concluded that it would\n\nhave been unlikely that Umi’s fist could have jabbed her eye as it was not natural\n\nfor a person landing on her buttocks to have her arms in front of her, as opposed to\n\nhaving it at the sides to try to cushion the impact of the fall.32 Assessing the key witnesses’ demeanour, the judge found that\n\nAng and Mdm Eng were sophisticated witnesses who were capable and willing to fabricate\n\nallegations to bolster their defence. The false allegations he was referring to included\n\nthe incident relating to the dog barking, chasing and licking Umi, as well as the\n\nallegation that Umi had planned her escape with another Indonesian maid. The judge, on the\n\nother hand, found Umi to be a truthful witness who was incapable of concocting false\n\naccusations against Ang. He excused Umi’s poor recollection of what had happened\n\nafter the fall since this was probably hampered by the injuries she had suffered. The\n\njudge was satisfied that she was clear and precise about what had happened at and around\n\nthe time of the alleged punch.33 On the basis of Umi’s version of facts, the medical evidence as\n\nwell as the credibility of the respective parties, the judge found that the prosecution\n\nhad made out the charge beyond reasonable doubt. Ang was duly convicted.",
        "Issues raised on appeal": "34 The crux of the appeal against conviction was that the judge had not\n\napplied the proper standard of proof. Counsel argued that he had failed to place adequate\n\nweight on the evidence of Ang and his wife, and had not given sufficient regard to the\n\nmedical evidence that the injury to Umi’s right eye could have been caused by the\n\nfall and not by the alleged punch.35 Furthermore, counsel said that the judge had erred in drawing a\n\nnumber of conclusions: first, that Ang’s concern for hygiene could have led him to\n\nassault Umi; second, that the sole reason for Umi’s dramatic escape was the alleged\n\npunch by Ang; third, that Umi had escaped from the flat because she feared being hit again\n\nby Ang; and fourth, that Umi was a witness of truth despite having admitted to lying on\n\nher rsum.36 Ang also appealed against the three month prison sentence. Counsel\n\nargued that it was manifestly excessive.",
        "Motion to adduce fresh evidence": "37 Counsel for the defence sought to adduce two medical reports at the\n\nappeal. The first was a report dated 6 February 2002 by Dr Ong Beng Beng from the\n\nDepartment of Pathology in the Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya. The gist of this\n\nreport was that, given the rate of appearance of the bruise, the absence of associated\n\ninjuries expected in a punch of this nature, facial and head injuries sustained in the\n\nfall, and the uncertainty of the dynamics of the fall and the subsequent landing, the\n\nbruise around Umi’s right eye was more likely to have been caused by the fall rather\n\nthan a direct punch. The second was a report dated 28 January 2002 prepared by Dr Raymond\n\nPhua from the Eye Centre and Surgery at Gleneagles Medical Centre. After studying the\n\nreports by Dr Tan and Dr Quah as well as the photographs of Umi’s bruised eye, the\n\ndoctor wrote that there was insufficient information to conclude that the injury was\n\ncaused by a punch.38 The law on the admission of fresh evidence at appeal pursuant to s\n\n257(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68) is well settled. Three elements must be\n\nsatisfied, namely:(a) Non-availability – the evidence could not have been obtained\n\n  with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;(b) Relevance – the evidence would probably have an important\n\n  influence on the result of the case, though it need not be decisive; and(c) Reliability – the evidence must be apparently credible, though\n\n  it need not be incontrovertible: seePandiyan Thanaraju Rogers v PP[2001] 3 SLR   281;Juma’at bin Samad v PP[1993] 3 SLR 338.39 I refused the motion to admit both medical reports because it had\n\nbeen clearly open to the defence during the trial before the magistrate to call these\n\ndoctors as expert witnesses. For some reason, counsel did not do so, even though it was a\n\nkey thrust of the defence that Umi’s injuries were sustained as a result of the fall\n\nrather than the alleged punch.40 It was pointed out that the ‘non-availability’ requirement\n\nwas not an absolute one. The Court may allow evidence to be admitted at the appeal stage\n\nnotwithstanding its availability at trial, if, in extenuating circumstances, the rejection\n\nof such evidence would result in a miscarriage of justice. This very narrow exception is\n\nin line with the core principle of s 257 of the Criminal Procedure Code that fresh\n\nevidence should be received in the interests of justice:Lee Yuen Hong v PP[2000] 2 SLR 339;Chan Chun Yee v PP[1998] 3 SLR 638. Be that as it may, I was of the\n\nopinion that the present situation did not fall within the ambit of the exception, for the\n\nvery simple reason that the defence had been content throughout the trial to rely on the\n\nevidence of Dr Tan and Dr Quah.41 It was submitted by defence counsel that the lawyer who had\n\nconducted Ang’s defence before the judge was unable to tender expert evidence because\n\nthe forensic psychologist from the Centre for Forensic Medicine, who had been ready and\n\nwilling to testify, could not obtain permission from his superiors in the department to do\n\nso. Even at the appeal stage, counsel faced the same difficulty. In a letter dated 29\n\nJanuary 2002, the Director of the Centre wrote to defence counsel to inform them that, as\n\na matter of policy, the Centre being part of the Health Sciences Authority \"should\n\nnot be involved in defence work which pertained to criminal cases\".42 I could not accept this refusal by one expert witness to testify at\n\ntrial as a basis for suggesting that there would be a miscarriage of justice if the Court\n\ndid not allow expert medical evidence to be adduced at the appeal stage. The Defence could\n\neasily have made the expedient decision to seek the opinion of other expert witnesses,\n\nsuch as Dr Raymond Phua or Dr Ong Beng Beng for example. It was also open to the defence\n\nat trial to subpoena the reluctant forensic expert from the Centre for Forensic Medicine.\n\nSection 180 (m) of the Criminal Procedure Code says:Procedure in summary trials180. The following procedure shall be observed by Magistrates’\n\n  Courts and District Courts in summary trials:…(m)(i) if the accused applies to the court to issue any process for\n\n    compelling the attendance of any witness, whether he has or has not been previously\n\n    examined in the case, for the purpose of examination or cross-examination or the\n\n    production of any document or other thing, the courtshall issue process unless it\n\n    considers that the application should be refused on the ground that it is made for the\n\n    purpose of vexation or delay or for defeating the ends of justice, in which case that\n\n    ground shall be recorded by it in writing;(ii) the court may, before summoning any witness on such application,\n\n    require that his reasonable expenses incurred in attending for the purposes of the trial\n\n    shall be deposited in court.\" [emphasis added]43 Apart from the exceptions italicised above, the ability of an\n\naccused person to compel competent and compellable witnesses to testify by subpoena is\n\notherwise unfettered:T.N. Janadharan Pillai v State of Kerala1992 Cri. LJ 436;State\n\nv Sabharuval & anor1989 Cri. LJ 2444. While these Indian authorities which I have\n\njust cited relate to witnesses of fact, I saw no good reason, at this point in time and\n\nwithout the benefit of counsels’ arguments, to read a distinction between witnesses\n\nof fact and witnesses of opinion into s 180 (m) of the CPC.",
        "Grounds for allowing the appeal": "44 Assessing the various points raised in the appeal, and having\n\nperused the detailed grounds of decision, I was of the opinion that too much weight had\n\nbeen given to Umi’s testimony, for a number of reasons. First, it could not be\n\nconclusively said that Umi was in grave fear for her own safety when she escaped from the\n\nflat. Secondly, I felt that it was not correct to require Ang to provide a rational\n\nexplanation for what was otherwise a highly irrational act on Umi’s part. Thirdly,\n\nthe assessment and findings on the medical evidence presented before the court were\n\nclearly wrong. Finally, I took issue with Umi’s delay in telling the good Samaritans\n\nwho had helped her about the alleged injury that her employer had inflicted upon her.",
        "Whether Umi was in grave fear for her own safety": "45 Umi alleged that Ang had punched her at or about 10:00 p.m. on the\n\nnight of 20 April 2000. After the assault, Umi said that Ang continued reading the\n\nnewspapers and watching television. She did not cry out despite the pain. Instead, she\n\nresumed her task of mopping the floor of the living room with a rag. Thereafter, Umi took\n\na shower, at which point she noticed a bruise around her right eye. She did nothing to\n\ntreat the bruise even though, according to Dr Jackie Tan, the pain from the fracture would\n\nhave been quite considerable. Umi then went to bed.46 At 3:30 am the next morning, some five and a half hours after the\n\nalleged punch, Umi said that she woke up with the feeling that she had to leave the flat.\n\nShe packed a bag containing her watch, purse, comb and some clothing. Having done that,\n\nshe climbed out of the fifth storey window and landed on the ground below.47 Taking all these into consideration, it could not be said that Umi\n\nwas in grave fear of being assaulted again and had to leave the flat at all costs. This\n\nsimply did not accord with the circumstances mentioned above. Any ‘grave fear’\n\nthat Umi might have felt at the time when she was allegedly punched must surely have\n\ndissipated very speedily, considering her actions immediately following that. Furthermore,\n\nat 3:30 a.m. in the wee hours of the morning, Ang was soundly asleep and it was not\n\nUmi’s evidence that he had threatened her with further violence.",
        "Demanding a rational explanation for an irrational act": "48 I also found that the judge had erred in holding that, because there\n\nwas no other plausible reason that the defence could proffer to explain Umi’s\n\ndecision to escape via a fifth storey window, and because something significant must have\n\noccurred on the night of 20 April 2000 to push her to take such a drastic step, that such\n\na significant event must have been the alleged punching incident. Put another way, what\n\nthe judge was in effect saying was that Umi’s drastic act of jumping out of a fifth\n\nstorey window was supportive evidence of the allegation forming the basis of the charge.49 This approach faltered in three critical respects. First, it was\n\nwrong to push the burden of proof onto Ang to find a plausible explanation for Umi’s\n\ndramatic behaviour. In any case, the theories advanced by the defence, such as the very\n\nlow salary that Umi was drawing, her homesickness and the possibility that she might have\n\nbeen uncomfortable with the in-laws’ pet dog, when viewed altogether, did not seem\n\nall that implausible as was made out to be. On the contrary, the finding that Ang’s\n\nconcern about hygiene was the driving force behind the assault ought to have been assessed\n\nwith more circumspection in light of the other evidence that Ang and Mdm Eng had simply\n\nsent their previous maid back to the maid agency and requested for a replacement when they\n\nhad found her to be unsatisfactory.50 Secondly, and more importantly, it failed to recognise that\n\nUmi’s actions were inherently illogical, when examined side-by-side with her\n\nallegation that she had been punched, once, some five and a half hours prior to her\n\nescape. As I have already stated earlier, I could not accept the finding that Umi was in\n\nany state of fear after that lapse of time. Thirdly, and consequently, it demanded the\n\nalmost impossible when the defence was expected to cough up an explanation that was\n\ncommensurate with the drastic nature of the course of action that Umi had taken. When an\n\nact was clearly not logical or rational, it would be a fallacy to persist in making\n\nlogical connections and extensions out of it.",
        "Assessment of the medical evidence": "51 I also took issue with the assessment of the medical evidence\n\nrelating to the cause of the bruise, known as a racoon bruise, under Umi’s right eye.\n\nAt best, the expert testimonies of Dr Jackie Tan and Dr Quah Song Chiek were equivocal\n\nabout the cause of the bruise.52 Dr Tan deposed in examination-in-chief that the racoon bruise\n\nresulted from the fracture of the lamina papyracea – this was usually caused by a\n\ndirect impact to the eye. If the injury was caused by the fall, the doctor surmised that\n\nit would have been far more serious in the sense that other parts of the orbit around the\n\neye would have been fractured. However, she also said that the severity and extent of such\n\ninjury would depend very much on the way in which the victim fell.53 In cross-examination, Dr Tan agreed with defence counsel that it was\n\nnot possible to rule out the fall as being a possible cause of the racoon bruise,\n\nespecially since there was no information as to how Umi had fallen. She agreed that\n\ncounsel’s theory that the bruise might have been caused by contact with the rounded\n\nknee was a possible one. It was also possible that Umi’s knee had contacted her elbow\n\non impact with the ground and driven her fist into the region of her right eye. Finally,\n\nDr Tan suggested that Umi’s injuries indicated that she might have landed on her feet\n\nrather than her buttocks, since there were no bruises to the buttocks.54 Dr Quah Song Chiek noted that Umi had bruises over both her eyes\n\nwhen he first examined her. There was the racoon bruise on her right eye and a minor\n\nbruise just over the left eye next to the nose bridge. He said that the racoon bruise was\n\nprobably due to a direct impact to the eye consistent with a punch. He disagreed with\n\ndefence counsel’s suggestion that it could have been caused by contact with the\n\nrounded knee because, if that was the case, the zygoma bone would have been fractured,\n\nresulting in an injury resembling a bruised cheek. This was also unlikely given Dr\n\nQuah’s theory that Umi had landed on her buttocks on the parapet of the first floor\n\nunit and then rolled over onto her anterior prospect. However, he agreed with counsel that\n\nit was possible that the bruise was a result of her fist accidentally jabbing the region\n\nof her eye during the fall. He said that the bruise over the left eye might have been\n\ncaused by the fall.55 Dr Quah’s theory that Umi had landed on her buttocks, even\n\nthough there were no bruises to the buttock region, was drawn from his observation that\n\nUmi’s right anterior pubic ramus had been fractured. Furthermore, it was not possible\n\nthat Umi had landed on her feet as there were no fractures to the ankles and feet or the\n\nelbow and clavicle, nor injuries to the lower facial region. The 2 cm laceration over the\n\nback of Umi’s head was consistent with the theory that she had landed on her buttocks\n\nand rolled over, resulting in the head wound. When asked about this when she was recalled\n\nto the stand, Dr Tan said that Dr Quah’s theory was a possible one.56 With regard to the bruises on the top of Umi’s feet, Dr Quah\n\nsuggested that it could be due to Umi landing on that part of her feet. They could also be\n\nscratches from contact with the window ledge or with the wall of the HDB block. Yet\n\nanother possibility to explain the bruises on the right leg was internal bleeding from the\n\nfractured pubic ramus. He had no idea, though, of how the bruises on the left leg could\n\nhave come about.57 It was patently clear to me, from the evidence of the two medical\n\nwitnesses, that it was not possible to be sure, beyond reasonable doubt, that the racoon\n\nbruise was caused by the punch rather than the fall. Much of the evidence was\n\ninconclusive, if not speculative, as the experts were not at all helped by Umi’s\n\ntotal lack of recollection as to how she had fallen or landed.58 I noted that the judge had made a finding of fact that Umi had\n\nattempted to scale down the wall and had fallen when she lost her footing. This was not a\n\ntenable finding, given Umi’s clear testimony that she had simply hung onto the metal\n\npipes on the fifth floor and then just let go of her hold.59 Umi had fallen from a height of 13 metres. Directly below the fifth\n\nstorey window were many other metal pipes used to hold drying poles, as well as a parapet\n\nforming the roof of the first storey flat. She had sustained a large number of physical\n\ninjuries as a result of the fall. A perusal of Dr Quah’s report to the investigation\n\nofficer of Tanglin Police Division HQ revealed that Umi had sustained no less than 26\n\ninjuries of varying severity, including fractures, bruises, abrasions and lacerations\n\nfound all over her body. Clearly there was a real possibility that Umi could have\n\nsustained the racoon bruise from the fall.",
        "Delay in telling the good Samaritans of the alleged assault": "60 In the case ofTang Kin Seng v PP[1997] 1 SLR 46, I said:The evidential value of a prompt complaint often lay not in the fact\n\n  that making it renders the victim’s testimony more credible. The evidential value of\n\n  a previous complaint is that the failure to make one renders the victim’s evidence\n\n  less credible. The reason is simple human experience. It is not usual human behaviour not\n\n  to make a quick complaint. However, as in all cases where common human experience is used\n\n  as a yardstick, there may be very good reasons why the victim’s actions depart from\n\n  it. It would be an error not to have regard to the explanation proffered.61 I am of the view that inadequate significance had been ascribed to\n\nthe fact that Umi did not complain to Mr Salleh that she had been punched in the eye by\n\nher employer. In fact, she was very reticent and reluctant to tell him much apart from the\n\nfact that she had suffered a fall. I noted that the explanation proffered was to the\n\neffect that Umi was afraid of being sent back to her employers, if she reported this\n\nmatter to the police. Umi also said in cross-examination that she had only told Mr Salleh\n\nthat she had fallen because he was only looking at her leg and torn pants, thus she did\n\nnot mention that she had been punched. However, viewed in light of all the circumstances,\n\nI did not believe these were good enough reasons. According to Mr Salleh, Umi was the one\n\nwho had approached him for help at 6:00 a.m. in the morning on 21 April 2000 and had\n\nwanted to follow him. He could communicate with her in a common tongue. He had gone out of\n\nhis way to provide her with food and a temporary shelter. Therefore, there was no\n\nacceptable reason why Umi, who had said that she had escaped the way she did because of\n\ngrave fear for her own safety, would not have taken the first opportunity to tell the\n\nfirst good Samaritan to come her way that she had been assaulted by her employer. In fact,\n\nUmi only finally volunteered this information to Siti and Mdm Latifah sometime after 6:00\n\np.m. on 21 April 2000 when they asked her whether she had been abused.",
        "Adverse findings on the credibility of Ang and Mdm Eng": "62 The judge held that Ang’s and Mdm Eng’s credibility was\n\naffected when they apparently exaggerated the incident between Umi and Mdm Eng’s\n\nparents’ pet dog. He also found that Mdm Eng had concocted evidence about a second\n\nIndonesian maid who had allegedly helped Umi in her plan to escape from the flat on the\n\nnight of 20 April 2000. It was telling that this allegation did not feature in any of\n\nAng’s or Mdm Eng’s statements. This included Ang’s cautioned statement to\n\nthe police.63 It is trite law that when a witness’s credibility is impeached\n\nor otherwise found to be wanting, the court will generally tend to regard his evidence\n\nwith less favour and accord it less weight. It has to scrutinise the whole of his evidence\n\nto decide which aspects might be true and which would have to be disregarded:Sundra\n\nMoorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 464.64 In the present case, the fact that the credibility of Ang and his\n\nwife had been seriously discounted did not prevent the defence from successfully arguing\n\nthat it had cast reasonable doubt over the prosecution’s case. This was because an\n\nacquittal followed either from successfully arguing an affirmative defence, which Ang had\n\nfailed to do so here, or by casting reasonable doubt over the prosecution’s case by\n\npointing to inherent flaws or improbabilities in its logic and evidence:Tan Buck Tee v\n\nPP[1961] 27 MLJ 176at 179.",
        "Conclusion": "65 Having assessed the case in its entirety, I was of the opinion that\n\nthe medical evidence could not establish with requisite certainty that the cause of the\n\nracoon eye was the punch that Ang had allegedly inflicted. Furthermore, the\n\ncomplainant’s act of jumping out of a fifth storey window under those circumstances\n\nreflected an irrational and unpredictable frame of mind and it would have been wrong to\n\ndraw any logical inferences or extensions from it, such as to support the allegation that\n\nUmi had been assaulted. Her reticence and reluctance to speak up about the alleged\n\nincident for a period of time despite being in the good hands of a family of Samaritans\n\nalso cast some doubt over the veracity of her account. In the result, while Ang was not\n\nable to establish an affirmative defence of innocence, it was more important to note that\n\nthe prosecution had not been able to prove beyond reasonable doubt that Ang was guilty of\n\nthe charge. Consequently, an acquittal would be in order as a conviction under the present\n\ncircumstances would have been unsafe.",
