        "Introduction": "1       The 1stand\n                        2ndDefendants sought in Summons No 3443 of 2015\n                    a stay of proceedings in Singapore commenced by the Plaintiff on the basis that\n                    the People’s Republic of China (“the PRC”) was the more\n                    appropriate forum, or alternatively, that all proceedings be stayed pending the\n                    disposal of the PRC proceedings. I declined the application, but granted the\n                        1stand 2ndDefendants’ application for leave to appeal in Summons No 5042 of\n                    2015.",
        "Background": "2       In February 2015, the Plaintiff began an action\n                    for minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    against the Defendants. Sino-Add (Singapore) Pte Ltd, the\n                        3rdDefendant, and Sino-Trust Shipping Pte Ltd,\n                    the 4thDefendant, were each owned by the Plaintiff,\n                        1stDefendant and 2ndDefendant, in the proportion 25:65:10 respectively. The three of them actually\n                    owned 12 companies in Singapore, Hong Kong, the PRC and the British Virgin\n                    Islands in the same manner. This group was on occasion referred to by some of\n                    the parties as “the Sino-Trust Group”. The group was not however a\n                    corporate group, as there were no cross-shareholdings among the companies. What\n                    was common, however, was shareholding by these three persons. 3       While the Plaintiff, on the one hand, and the\n                        1stand 2ndDefendants\n                    initially had at least a working relationship, if not a good one, the\n                    relationship between them broke down towards the second quarter of 2014. The\n                    Plaintiff thus launched his minority oppression action seeking a buy out or\n                    alternatively, the winding up of the 3rdand\n                        4thDefendants. 4       The Plaintiff applied for leave to serve the\n                    cause papers out of jurisdiction in March 2015. 5       In the meantime, there were two proceedings\n                    commenced by Sino-Trust Corporation against the Plaintiff, alleging\n                    misappropriation of corporate funds by the Plaintiff, and the other his unlawful\n                    possession of original financial documents belonging to companies that are part\n                    of the “Sino-Trust Group”. Judgment was given in the latter\n                    proceedings by a Dalian first instance court which ruledinter aliathat: (a) the actual place of business of the all the\n                    companies in the group was at the office of Sino-Trust Corporation in Dalian;\n                    (b) Sino-Trust was responsible for the management and operation of all the other\n                    companies; (c) Sino-Trust had the power to maintain all the financial documents\n                    of the other companies; (d) the financial documents held by the Plaintiff were\n                    the assets of the companies; and (e) there was nothing to show that the\n                    Plaintiff went through the proper process to obtain the documents. The\n                    proceedings on misappropriation were not complete by the time of the hearing\n                    before me.",
        "The Defendant’s Arguments": "6       The Defendant argued for a stay to be granted\n                    under the principles inSpiliada Maritime Corporation v\n                        Cansulex[1987] AC 460 (“Spiliada”). The following factors relevant to the\n                        1ststage of theSpiliadatest pointed to the PRC: the residence and place of\n                    business of the parties, the location of the events; witnesses would be resident\n                    in the PRC; witnesses would likely have limited English skills; the Shareholders\n                    Agreements governing the relationship between the Plaintiff, the\n                        1stand 2ndDefendants\n                    were made in the PRC and were in Chinese; other proceedings in the Dalian would\n                    have a material effect on the claim of oppression. 7       As for the second stage, the Shareholders\n                    Agreements, drafted by the Plaintiff himself, specified limits and mechanisms\n                    for the exit of the shareholders. The fact that the Plaintiff would not be able\n                    to get the same cause of action or relief in the PRC does not mean he could not\n                    obtain justice in the PRC. 8       An expert opinion confirmed that in respect of\n                    the remedies claimed by the Plaintiff in Singapore, he could obtain the same or\n                    similar remedies such as a buy out or winding up. A PRC court would also\n                    conclude that Singapore law applies, but even if it were determined that PRC\n                    Company Law applied, there are similar reliefs available. The plaintiff would\n                    not be deprived of any real juridical advantage. 9       In applying the two-stage test inSpiliada, the fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate\n                    personal or juridical advantage in proceedings in Singapore is not\n                    decisive.",
        "The Plaintiff’s arguments": "10     It was contended firstly that the primary\n                    factors to be considered in the present case was the applicable law to the\n                    dispute and the nature of the dispute. 11     It could not be shown in respect of a minority\n                    oppression action that another forum is competent to resolve the dispute and is\n                    clearly the more appropriate forum as such a minority oppression action is based\n                    on a Singapore statute giving specific rights to shareholders, and the company\n                    is a Singapore company subject to that statute:Transtech\n                        Electronics Pte Ltd v Choe Jerry and Ors[1998] 1 SLR(R) 1014\n                        (“Transtech”). A similar\n                    position was reached inRe NasbulkBVIHCM (COM)\n                    65/2012 at first instance in the British Virgin Islands (“Nasbulk”). The East Caribbean Court of Appeal\n                    (“ECCA”) inNasbulkat the appeal\n                    stage,Nanjing Ocean (BVI) Co Ltd v Gao Chunhe and\n                        anorBVIHCAP 2013/0005 (“Nanjing\n                        Ocean”) reached a different conclusion but should not be\n                    followed. 12     In contrast to Singapore, the PRC is not the\n                    more appropriate forum. The Shareholders Agreements were not the basis of the\n                    claim, and thus the governing law, the choice of court and the language and\n                    execution of the Shareholders Agreements were irrelevant. 13     No equivalent provision to s 216 is available\n                    under the PRC Company Law. It is telling that the 1stand 2ndDefendants previously took the position that\n                    withdrawal from the group had no basis in the Shareholders\n                Agreements. 14     Contrary to the contentions of the\n                    Defendant’s expert, the Plaintiff's expert gave the opinion that there was\n                    no power for the court to order that the 3rdand\n                        4thDefendants assume any liabilities or to order\n                    the winding up of the 3rdand\n                        4thDefendants. The place of the actual\n                    oppression was not disputed, and would at most be a neutral\n                factor. 15     There being not a single group, there was no\n                    justification to treat them as a single entity. The companies operated\n                    independently. The location of witnesses was not crucial, and in any event the\n                    geographical location of witnesses is not determinative. The location of\n                    documents was also not a strong factor pointing to the PRC. The Dalian\n                    proceedings were distinct, and different from the Singapore proceedings. Even if\n                    there is a risk of conflicting judgments that is not determinative:Rickshaw Investments Ltd and anor v Nicolai Baron von\n                        Uexkull[2007] 1 SLR (R) 377 (“Rickshaw”) at [90]. 16     Even if the 1ststage of theSpiliadatest pointed to the PRC,\n                    justice required that a stay be denied. The Plaintiff would be unable to pursue\n                    a minority oppression or equivalent action in the PRC, and would not be able to\n                    obtain either winding up or a buy-out by the 3rdand\n                        4thDefendants.",
        "The Decision": "17     I declined to order the stay sought by the\n                        1stand 2ndDefendants. The fact that the Plaintiff was invoking a statutory action in\n                    respect of a dispute within a Singapore company was an important consideration.\n                    This matrix supplied factors that went to both the\n                        1stand 2ndstages of\n                    theSpiliadatest. 18     The fact that the claim was in respect of a\n                    shareholders’ dispute within a Singapore-incorporated company was an\n                    important connecting factor that, coupled with the specific claim of a minority\n                    oppression action under the Companies Act outweighs any other connecting factor\n                    pointing to the PRC. 19     Even if I was wrong on the analysis for the\n                    first stage, at the 2ndstage analysis, the question\n                    of the specific remedy or juridical advantage available to the plaintiffs would\n                    not be available to him in the PRC and it would cause injustice for him to be\n                    deprived of it. 20     I should note that the Defendants did not seek\n                    to set aside the Plaintiff’s service out of the jurisdiction on the basis\n                    that Singapore was not the appropriate forum. There would be a difference in\n                    burden in respect of a challenge to service out under Order 11 of the Rules of\n                    Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed) as the Plaintiff would have had to show that\n                    Singapore was the more appropriate forum, with the Defendants then showing that\n                    it would be unjust to allow service out:Siemens AG v\n                        Holdrich Investment Ltd[2010] 3 SLR 1007. In the end though,\n                    nothing turned on this as I was satisfied that in any case Singapore was the\n                    appropriate forum.",
        "Analysis": "21     The principles enunciated inSpiliadahave been applied on many occasions locally. In\n                    essence, on a stay application, at the 1ststage, the\n                    Defendants here would have the burden of showing that the PRC is a more\n                    appropriate forum. Thereafter, at the 2ndstage of\n                    theSpiliadatest, the Plaintiff would have to\n                    show that it would be unjust to send him to that forum. There appears to be\n                    readiness to conflate the two stages into one, namely, whether it is shown that\n                    Singapore is the appropriate forum: seeVTB Capital Plc v\n                        Nitrite International Corp[2012] EWCA Civ 808. It may be that\n                    there is much to commend a single stage analysis, but I am bound by the\n                    two-stage approach laid down inBrinkerhoff Maritime Drilling\n                        Corp and anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia and anor appeal[1992] 2 SLR (R) 345 and similar cases.",
        "The 1stStage of the Spiliada\n                test": "22     Singapore was the more appropriate forum in\n                    view of the nature of the claim made by the Plaintiff; factors which pointed to\n                    the PRC were either neutral or of relatively little weight. 23     In considering this issue, the legal character\n                    of the claim asserted by Plaintiff was to be differentiated from the existence\n                    or otherwise of a juridical or legitimate advantage. What this meant was that\n                    the nature of the dispute raised by the Plaintiff had be analysed in terms of\n                    its legal basis, the evidence that would be required, the applicable law, and\n                    the relevant parties with standing to defend or which would be affected in legal\n                    terms by the determination of the issue. These factors were distinct from those\n                    that would go to the question whether there was a juridical or legitimate\n                    advantage and if so, whether it would be just to deprive the plaintiff of\n                    that. The nature of the claim 24     The claim made by the Plaintiff was for\n                    minority oppression under s 216 of the Companies Act. That provision permitted,\n                    among others, a shareholder to apply to the court for an order on the basis that\n                    the affairs of the company or the powers of the directors are being exercised in\n                    an oppressive manner, or that some act of the company has been done or\n                    threatened which unfairly discriminates. The court may then make various orders\n                    including prohibiting the act or cancelling a transaction, authorising civil\n                    proceedings to be brought in the name of the company, order compulsory purchase\n                    of shares, or the winding-up of the company. 25     Aside from the specific remedies, which are\n                    potentially relevant in the analysis of the 2ndstage\n                    of theSpiliadaanalysis, a claim under s 216 is\n                    primarily a claim made by a shareholder in respect of his interest in a\n                    Singapore company, concerning allegations in the activity of that company or the\n                    decisions of the board of directors of that company. The records, including\n                    those that may need to be statutorily filed, would be in Singapore or should at\n                    least be accessible in Singapore. The law governing the affairs of the company\n                    and the obligations owed by the company, the general duties of the directors and\n                    the general obligations of the majority to the minority would be governed by\n                    Singapore law. The centre of gravity of such a claim would be in\n                    Singapore. 26     It is against this framework that I understandTranstechto be decided. The case was cited by\n                    the Plaintiff for the proposition that the existence of the statutory action\n                    indicated that Singapore was the more appropriate forum. What to my mind\n                    mattered was not so much that the action was statutory – in many systems\n                    of law most if not all rights are statutory in some way – but rather that\n                    the forum’s domestic laws had prescribed a framework for assertion of\n                    rights in a particular factual scenario, giving legal rights and imposing legal\n                    obligations to the various participants in that scenario. Where the scenario\n                    pertains, the predisposition would be to regard the forum as the natural forum,\n                    and that otherforiwould be inappropriate. InTranstech, Prakash J stated, at [19]: … [Counsel’s] difficulty was, of course, that in order to\n                        obtain a stay on the basis offorum non\n                            conveniens, the applicant must show that there is another\n                        forum which is competent to resolve the dispute and which is clearly the\n                        more appropriate forum for its resolution. The defendants here could not\n                        show that because the action in Singapore is based on a Singapore statute\n                        which gives certain rights to an allegedly oppressed minority shareholder\n                        and the company in which such oppressive activity is alleged to have taken\n                        place is a Singapore company subject to that statute. Further, the\n                        defendants in the Singapore action were sued in their capacity as directors\n                        of the company and for actions undertaken in such capacity relating to the\n                        handling of various business transactions and moneys on behalf of the\n                        company and in the course of this business. Even if they could be sued in\n                        such a capacity for such actions and for the same relief in New York (a\n                        matter on which no submission was made by the defendants), the New York\n                        court would not be the most appropriate one to resolve a dispute which\n                        involved the meaning and scope of a Singapore statute. It is evident that the concern was with the rights conferred on\n                    the claimant, and the obligations imposed on the other parties. All of these\n                    pointed to Singapore and were the more important factors in that\n                case. 27     I did not think that the decision of the ECCA\n                    inNanjing Oceanwas necessarily an authority\n                    against the approach I took. In the first instance decision inNasbulk, Bannister J concluded that the invoking of a\n                    statutory remedy precluded any argument that the British Virgin Islands were the\n                    more inappropriate forum, in the face of other factors pointing elsewhere,\n                    including the PRC. Because of that statutory remedy, Banister J considered that\n                    the case before him was not amenable toSpiliadaanalysis, despite the presence of factors which the judge found pointing to the\n                    PRC. However, the decision was reversed on appeal, with the ECCA finding that\n                    the PRC was the natural forum there. The ECCA differed from Bannister J,\n                    applyingSpiliadafully, and agreed with his\n                    earlier conclusion that the PRC was the more appropriate forum. 28     Where I have differed from the ECCA is in\n                    terms of the weighing of the various factors; I would note only, with respect,\n                    that the ECCA did not seem to have considered the invoking of a statutory claim\n                    as containing factors which need to be weighed against the factors pointing to\n                    the PRC. I would differ with the ECCA on that score. I have not taken the\n                    precise position of Bannister J that s 216 precluded the operation ofSpiliadaprinciples. Rather, as I have noted above, the\n                    nature of the claim carries with it several factors that needed to be weighed\n                    against those on the other side. 29     For the same reason, there is also no conflict\n                    in principle between my approach and the decision ofIn re\n                        Harrods (Buenos Aires) Ltd[1992] Ch 72 (“Harrods”) in the English Court of Appeal which\n                    appliedSpiliadaprinciples. Where there was a\n                    difference was in respect of the 2ndstage, which I\n                    will deal with below. 30     Against the weight of these factors pointing\n                    to Singapore as the more appropriate forum in a s 216 action, the following\n                    factors identified by the Defendants could not cumulatively show that the PRC\n                    was the more appropriate forum: (a) the Shareholders Agreements; (b) the nature\n                    of the witnesses; (c) the structure of the group; and (d) the PRC\n                    proceedings. The Shareholders Agreements 31     The Shareholders Agreements may govern the\n                    position of the shareholders, and may in principle be relevant in action for\n                    minority oppression. But in any action for minority oppression, it is\n                    conceivable that a shareholder agreement would be just one of several sources of\n                    evidence. Oral discussions for instance, and the conduct of parties may be\n                    material as well. The existence of the Shareholders Agreements could not thus be\n                    determinative. The Structure of the Group 32     The Defendants referred to the companies in\n                    question as being part of a group. However, as pointed out by the Plaintiff, the\n                    companies are not in a formal structure. The Defendants nonetheless maintained\n                    that the companies were really a single economic entity. Arguments that groups\n                    of companies should be treated as single entity are made occasionally, to allow\n                    the separate corporate identities of different companies to be disregarded,\n                    especially when the shareholdings are held ultimately held by an individual or\n                    group of individuals. Where the separation of identities is used to camouflage\n                    fraudulent dealings by the common or ultimate shareholders, the courts would be\n                    justified in disregarding the different companies created, which are essentially\n                    interposed for ill-ends. However, it sits oddly for the controlling shareholder\n                    to establish companies to handle his various businesses, make use of the\n                    separate corporate identity, and then ask the court to disregard corporate\n                    structures whenever it suits him. 33     So it is in the present case, with the\n                    Plaintiff and 1stand 2ndDefendants having direct shareholdings in each company. There being no direct\n                    corporate relationship between the different companies, the\n                        1stand 2ndDefendants\n                    cannot in these proceedings ask the court to disregard the separate identities\n                    of the companies, even if it is true that they treated the companies as a single\n                    undivided whole. They cannot invoke that argument simply because that doctrine\n                    should only available against those who have used the corporate identity as a\n                    façade to hide or disguise dealings; they were after all in the majority, and\n                    cannot claim any equivalent sham by a minority shareholder. The Witnesses 34     The 1stand\n                        2ndDefendants argued that most witnesses would\n                    be in the PRC, and conversant primarily in Mandarin. Against that, the Plaintiff\n                    argued that it was likely that the presence of witnesses would not be crucial. I\n                    was of the view that even if witnesses from the PRC were needed, this could be\n                    easily addressed in various ways. Singapore courts are used to having foreign\n                    witnesses testifying in languages other than English; where necessary such\n                    witnesses can testify from overseas:Peter Roger May v Pinder\n                        Lillian Gek Lian[2006] 2 SLR (R) 381. The location of documents\n                    is even less of an issue in cases generally:John Reginald\n                        Stott Kirkham and Ors v Trane US Inc and Ors[2009] 4 SLR(R)\n                    428. Proceedings in the PRC 35     As for the PRC proceedings, I do not find that\n                    either would be controlling or even largely relevant to the present proceedings.\n                    The proceedings there were concerned with the alleged misappropriation of funds\n                    by the Plaintiff and the retention of documents by him. The question of\n                    retention of documents was not likely to be material to an oppression action in\n                    Singapore orvice versa. As for the\n                    misappropriation of funds, there is the possibility that there may be some\n                    overlap in allegations, but just as possibly, there may not. Additionally, the\n                    parties in the PRC proceedings are not the same as those involve Sino-Trust\n                    Corporation. 36     In any event, as argued by the Plaintiff, even\n                    if an overlap arose, that would not be conclusive. InRickshaw, the Court of Appeal noted at [90]: … The danger of conflicting judgments must be weighed against the\n                        other factors in theSpiliadaenquiry and we\n                        have seen that, hitherto, the various factors point towards Singapore as\n                        being the most appropriate forum to hear the case. The relevant factors,\n                        when considered in their totality, strongly militate against any suggestion\n                        that the German courts would be “clearly more appropriate”\n                        than the Singapore courts. Thus, conflicting judgments would just be one factor to be weighed\n                    against the others. In the present case, the possibility of conflicting\n                    judgments on misappropriation of funds, retention of documents and minority\n                    oppression did not seem significant; and even if there were any such conflict,\n                    it would not outweigh the significant pointer to Singapore inherent in the\n                    nature of the Plaintiff’s claim of minority oppression in a Singapore\n                    company. Differences in Law 37     Additionally, I note the evidence of the\n                    Plaintiff’s expert, which I prefer to that of the Defendant’s. The\n                    Defendant’s expert took the position that the difference with Singapore\n                    law was not significant. It may be that at this 1ststage of theSpiliadatest, the fact that the laws\n                    of competingforimay not be significantly\n                    different would render this factor neutral or of little weight. However, I was\n                    not convinced that there was little substantive difference between Singapore and\n                    PRC law. The rights and obligations in respect of corporations and shareholding\n                    do not seem to be the same. The Plaintiff’s expert had noted that PRC\n                    Company Law would not be applicable to foreign companies not registered in the\n                    PRC: I prefer his evidence that the PRC courts would not apply PRC Company Law\n                    to the present dispute. I did not see anything in the Defendant’s\n                    expert’s report that pointed the other way. That being the case, the type\n                    of claim made by the Plaintiff could not be brought before the PRC courts, only\n                    a contractual dispute, which is of a wholly different nature,\n                could. 38     The Defendants’ expert referred to a\n                    number of provisions, but several of these do not seem to relate to anything\n                    like a minority oppression action, but rather shareholders’ rights\n                    generally, such as Articles 20 and 33 of the PRC Company Law. Reference was made\n                    to Article 182 which permits winding up if there is the threat of heavy losses\n                    to shareholders from difficulty in operations or management, but that does not\n                    seem connected to the relationship of shareholdersinter\n                        se. While it is not necessary or even expected that PRC law would\n                    contain a provision that provides the same type of claim as a minority\n                    oppression action, the absence of an equivalent set of provisions giving the\n                    same effect would be a factor that points to Singapore being a more appropriate\n                    forum to hear such a claim. A forum that does not have a functional equivalent\n                    would not in general be an appropriate forum unless for instance the claim was\n                    but a sham or a disguise. 39     The Plaintiff took issue with the\n                    Defendant’s expert’s assertion that the PRC courts could apply\n                    Singapore law. There was nothing on this in the Plaintiff’s expert report,\n                    presumably in light of the questions posed to him. However, while expert opinion\n                    on foreign law is a matter of fact (at least of a special kind:King v Brandywine Reinsurance Co[2005] EWCA 235), I was\n                    not convinced that the Defendant’s expert was of the view that Singapore\n                    company law would be applied.His discussion in his affidavit seemed to be geared\n                    towards considering whether PRC Company Law would be applicable to Singapore\n                    registered companies if they had a different place of actual business. In any\n                    event, even if a PRC court would apply Singapore company law, that does not make\n                    the PRC the more appropriate forum. All the various factors would have to be\n                    considered and weighed. A dispute about Singapore companies in respect of the\n                    relations between the shareholders would seem to be more suited for\n                    determination by a Singapore court unless there were significant countervailing\n                    measures pointing the other way. I did not see any in the present\n                case. Conclusion as to the more appropriate forum 40     All in all then, Singapore was the more\n                    appropriate forum in view of the nature of the claim asserted by the Plaintiff;\n                    the various other factors in the present case were either neutral or if they\n                    pointed to the PRC, did not outweigh those pointing to Singapore.",
        "The 2ndstage of the Spiliada\n                test": "41     The unavailability of remedies in the PRC\n                    relating to a s 216 action would be significant. I note that the fact that local\n                    remedies may not be available abroad would not generally be sufficient to show\n                    the loss of a juridical advantage – there must be a substantive element\n                    rather than just a difference in quantum or degree: seeSpiliadaandGoh Suan Huee v Teo Cher\n                        Teck[2010] 1 SLR 367 (“Goh Suan\n                        Hee”). 42     Despite the evidence of the defendants’\n                    expert that the same or similar remedies would be available in Chinese\n                    proceedings, I accept the Plaintiff's expert’s evidence that these would\n                    not. There is no directly equivalent provision to s 216. It was pointed out that\n                    the precedents cited by the Defendant’s expert were not on point and did\n                    not show the existence of a minority oppression action. Further, as argued by\n                    the Plaintiff, the winding up of the 3rdand\n                        4thDefendants would not be available to a PRC\n                    Court in respect of a company law action. 43     The Defendants citedHarrodsfor the proposition that it was not essential that the\n                    plaintiff should be able to obtain identical relief in the foreign jurisdiction\n                    or that the courses of action which can be pursued should be the same in both\n                    jurisdictions.Harrodsitself is instructive as a\n                    stay was granted in England though the claim was for minority oppression in an\n                    English incorporated company, with the registered office in London but with its\n                    business wholly in Argentina. However, departing from the CA inHarrods, I am of the view that the ability to be bought\n                    out or to effect a winding up in respect of a dispute concerning the internal\n                    relations of the company itself would be a sufficient basis. The ability to be\n                    bought out, and the winding up of a Singapore company are material advantages,\n                    which the plaintiff should not be deprived of. The participation by a\n                    shareholder in a company would be premised on many things, but among the\n                    considerations would be the expectation that as a member or shareholder he or\n                    she would be entitled to have a voice in the running of the company, or if that\n                    does not work out because of the actions or omission of the majority of the\n                    shareholders or members, there would be the ability to exit the company by way\n                    of a buy-out. Leaving aside the ability to be bought out in the case of\n                    oppression or other concerted action by the majority may not achieve substantive\n                    justice in respect of a complaining shareholder. That to my mind would affect\n                    the achieving of substantive justice, as required bySpiliadaandGoh Suan\n                Huee. 44     It may be argued that a shareholder in a\n                    private company cannot really complain if he is stuck with his investment\n                    – that is a normal risk that such an investor runs in such a company. But\n                    the position where a shareholder suffers oppression would be different –\n                    locking-in the shareholder in that situation piles on a disability on top of his\n                    being subject to unfair actions by others. 45     Thus even if I was wrong on Singapore being\n                    the more appropriate forum, I would have found that the Plaintiff showed grounds\n                    in favour of the Court’s exercise in favour of Singapore on the\n                        2ndstage of theSpiliadatest.",
        "Stay in respect of foreign proceedings": "46     The Defendants applied alternatively for stay\n                    on the grounds that there were foreign proceedings underway. This is recognised\n                    as an independent basis separate from stay onforum non\n                        conveniens. However, in the present case, the same result would\n                    arise in view of my conclusions concerning the differences between the local\n                    proceedings and those in the PRC.",
        "Leave to appeal": "47     I granted leave to appeal in the present case\n                    on the Defendants’ application, as I concluded that there was an issue of\n                    importance that merited determination by the Court of Appeal for the guidance on\n                    the law. The increased use of Singapore companies by foreign shareholders not\n                    just in connection with businesses in Singapore but regionally and\n                    internationally means that disputes similar to the present andTranstechwill arise more frequently. It will assist the\n                    development of Singapore law and business activity for the guidance given by the\n                    apex court.",
        "Conclusion": "48     For the reasons above, I declined to stay the\n                    Plaintiff’s claim. Costs of $10,000 and reasonable disbursements were\n                    awarded to the Plaintiff. 49     I had noted in my oral remarks that I did not\n                    think there was a significant difference in philosophy between the position I\n                    had taken and the decisions inNasbulkandHarrods. I remain of that view in so far as\n                    the broad application of theSpiliadaprinciples\n                    is concerned. Where I have differed from those decisions was essentially in the\n                    characterisation of the nature of a minority oppression claim and its\n                    remedies."
