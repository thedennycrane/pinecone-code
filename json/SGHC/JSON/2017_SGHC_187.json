        "Introduction": "1 After I delivered my judgment inRajendarPrasad Rai and another v Public Prosecutor and another matter[2017] SGHC 49 (“the Judgment”), the Prosecution applied for a temporary stay of the orders I had made, pending an application that it intended to make for a restraint order under the Corruption, Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes (Confiscation of Benefits) Act (Cap 65A, 2000 Rev Ed) (“CDSA”). I had ordered that certain funds, which had been seized by the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau (“CPIB”), be released to the applicants. As to this, the Prosecution’s primary concern was over the risk of dissipation in that it might not be able to attach those funds even if an order were subsequently made under the CDSA. The background facts leading to the orders I made are set out in the Judgmentat [2]–[11], and terms defined there are used here in the same wayunless I state otherwise. 2 The Prosecution’s application raised the following issues: (a) whether I had the power to stay the orders I had made for the applicants’ funds to be released or to suspend the operation of those orders pending the filing of proceedings by the Prosecution under the CDSA; and (b) if I had such power, whether it ought to be exercised. The Prosecution indicated that the application raised novel points of law and there were no direct authorities on the subject. I therefore granted a short adjournment for further argument. 3 The next day, I heard the parties’ further submissions. In the Prosecution’s submission, the power of the court to temporarily stay the effects of its order was to be found in s 390(2) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC 2012”). The Prosecution submitted that I ought to exercise my power under that provision, in essence, to prevent dissipation of the seized funds. At the conclusion of the hearing, I dismissed the Prosecution’s application and gave brief reasons for my decision. I now issue these grounds to explain my decision more fully.",
        "Whether the court has the power to stay its orders or suspend their operation": "",
        "The Prosecution’s submissions": "32 Assuming that the power under s 390(2) was wide enough to confer a general power to stay the order if it were “just” to do so, the Prosecution submitted that three issues must be considered in determining whether a stay was “just” on the facts. 33 First, the CPC seizure provisions and the CDSA restraint order provisions should apply together seamlessly throughout the lifecycle of investigations and criminal proceedings, so that there would be no temporal gap between an order for the release of the monies being made under the CPC and the granting of the restraint order under the CDSA. Otherwise, there would be an unsatisfactory risk of dissipation, and this would undermine the purpose and effectiveness of these provisions. The Prosecution cited the Court of Appeal’s decision inUng YokeHooi v Attorney-General[2009] 3 SLR(R) 307 (“Ung YokeHooi”), which in its view supported this analysis. According to the Prosecution, the Court of Appeal inUng YokeHooihad recognised that if the CPC and CDSA provisions did not operate seamlessly, a situation might arise where different courts were approached by different parties to deal discretely with what may in substance entail the consideration of the same legal issues, albeit pursuant to different legislative provisions, without reference to each other. This would be unsatisfactory. 34 The second consideration was the possible prejudice to the public interest, compared to that occasioned to the applicants, if a temporary stay was not granted. In this regard, the Prosecution indicated that the temporary stay, if granted, would endure only for a few days at most because it expected to be in a position to commence CDSA proceedings against the applicants by the end of the week. Should the funds be dissipated, however, the prejudice to the public interest could be irreparable if, as might well be the case, the monies could not subsequently be easily traced and recovered. Moreover, the court would also be setting a bad precedent for future cases where parties would have to commence multiple proceedings whenever the continued seizure of property is challenged. This may be contrasted with the prejudice to the applicants, which would be much less significant considering that the stay requested was a short one. For these reasons, the Prosecution argued that it would be “just” to stay the order under s 390(2). 35 Finally, the Prosecution also submitted that it would be unjust to deny a temporary stay because the CDSA proceedings could not have been filed before the s 370 Hearing in this case. While the chronology of investigations might permit the Prosecution to bring proceedings expeditiously in certain cases, there were instances such as the present where it would be impracticable or impossible for proceedings to be filed on or by the date on which the seizure of property must be reported. According to the Prosecution, it could not be the case that there was no provision at law to permit an extension of time to enable the authorities to conclude their investigations in such situations, and it seemed arbitrary to deny them the right to continue the seizure of property just because the evidence available at the time of reporting was insufficient to enable them to do so.",
        "My decision": "36 After considering their arguments, I held that there was no basis for me to exercise the power in favour of continuing the seizure, even if such a power did exist under s 390(2). 37 In my judgment, the critical point was that to make such an order would be to go a step beyond what was contemplated and permitted byUng YokeHooi. InUng YokeHooi, the appellants’ bank accounts had been seized by the CPIB pursuant to s 68 of the CPC 1985, which confers powers to seize property in respect of which it is suspected that an offence had been committed. However, the seizures in that case were not reported to a Magistrate’s Court as required by s 392(1) of the CPC 1985. Thereafter, the CPIB intimated its intention to proceed with confiscation orders under the CDSA. The appellant commenced an action seeking leave to apply for judicial review, specifically to obtain a mandatory order directing the CPIB to release his accounts on the basis that the seizures were illegal, unreasonable and procedurally improper. One of the grounds relied on was that the CPIB’s intention to proceed with confiscation orders under the CDSA would amount to an abuse of process. The High Court judge dismissed the application and held that it could not be an abuse of process for the CPIB to take out confiscation proceedings under the CDSA after invoking s 68(1) of the CPC 1985 to seize the appellant’s accounts, because s 68(1) was only an interim means used to preserve evidence while investigations were ongoing (seeUng YokeHooiat [14]). On appeal, the Court of Appeal agreed that the commencement of confiscation proceedings under the CDSA would not be an abuse of process, although it observed that the CPIB’s decision to initiate such proceedings showed it had concluded that there was no legal basis for it not to return the seized funds to the appellant (Ung YokeHooiat [34]). 38 WhileUng YokeHooidid contemplate the possibility of commencing CDSA proceedings following the seizure of property pursuant to CPC provisions, it is crucial to note that the facts of that case were quite different. As I mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the case ofUng YokeHooiconcerned an action for judicial review, which sought to compel the CPIB to release seized properties on the basis that the seizures were illegal, unreasonable and an abuse of process. It was not dealing with an application such as the present, where the Prosecution was seeking to continue the seizure of the applicants’ property under the CDSAafterthe order which allowed it to do so was found to be invalid. Indeed, inUng YokeHooi, the issue of whether the seizures were in fact unsustainable at law to begin with had not been decided at the time of the proceedings (seeUng YokeHooiat [26]). By contrast, in the present application, the Magistrate’s Order had already been found to be unsustainable and was set aside on that ground, and in these circumstances, the Prosecution was asking me to stay the effects of that decision before any CDSA proceedings had even been commenced. In other words, unlike the situation inUng YokeHooi, it was clear that the legal basis for the seizure of property in the present case had already been extinguished at the time the Judgment was delivered and there was nothing else at law to undergird the continued seizure of applicants’ funds. On the facts, the Prosecution was asking for what was in essence an anticipatory order before CDSA proceedings had even been commenced, and the effect of which was to retrospectively validate an order that had already been found to be invalid. In my view, there was nothing inUng YokeHooiwhich supported such a course. 39 I was also not persuaded by the Prosecution’s second argument, which was that it was “just” to stay the orders on account of the possible prejudice to the public interest occasioned by the release of the funds as compared to the prejudice that would be suffered by the applicants. To my mind, the policy interest in avoiding the risk of dissipation must be weighed against other important considerations such as that against depriving persons of their property without any justification. To ask the court, in essence, to uphold an order which it had already found to be without legal basis seemed contrary to the fundamental principle that persons should not be deprived of their property except in accordance with the law, which must be the overriding imperative here. 40 Finally, I turn to the last argument raised by the Prosecution, which was that they should not be denied a stay just because the progress of investigations did not permit them to bring proceedings before the s 370 Hearing was held. With respect, the argument raised by the Prosecution misses the point, which brings me to the broader principle that should be drawn in the present case. Here, the purpose of a long-stop date by which the seizure of property under s 370 of the CPC 2012 must be reported is underpinned by the philosophy that, while the rights of all individuals are subject to being curtailed by the powers of the state, those powers are in turn subject to limits which exist to prevent their abuse. In the present case, these limits are found in the express provisions of the CPC 2012, which only permit the seizure of funds without judicial oversight for a one-year period. As I mentioned in the Judgment, should the Prosecution wish to retain the property beyond the one-year period, this is subject to judicial oversight and the seizure will only be permitted to continue upon the fulfilment of certain conditions. 41 It follows from this that it would not be correct to say that there was no provision at law to allow the Prosecution an extension of time to complete investigations and retain the property in the interim where the progress of the investigations made it impracticable for proceedings to be filed on or before the long-stop date. This is because it is possible for the court to permit the continued retention of property seized under s 370 in at least three situations: (a) on the basis of the three-stage inquiry set out at [46] of the Judgment; (b) where the court is satisfied on the evidence that the seized property should be retained pursuant to s 370(3); and (c) where the court is satisfied that there is basis to adjourn the proceedings under s 238 of the CPC 2012 and to make its decision on the return of the seized property only at a later date. That none of these situations was found to arise on these facts simply means that there was no basis for continuing to seize the funds; that in itself does not warrant the conclusion that it would be unjust to refuse a stay. 42 In the circumstances, I was amply satisfied that there were no grounds to extend the seizure, even assuming I had the power to do so.",
        "If there was power, whether the power ought to be exercised to grant a stay": "31 Although I have found that there was no power under s 390 of the CPC 2012 to make the order sought by the Prosecution, and although this was sufficient to dispose of the matter, I briefly considered whether such a power ought to have been exercised, had it existed, because this was the focal point of parties’ submissions, and more importantly because of the broader principle which underpinned my decision.",
        "Conclusion": "43 I therefore concluded that the Prosecution’s application to temporarily stay the orders which I had made should be dismissed, and that the orders were to be carried out with immediate effect.
