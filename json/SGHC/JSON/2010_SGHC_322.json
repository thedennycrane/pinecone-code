        "Introduction": "1       The appellant (“the Wife”) and the\n                    respondent (“the Husband”) were married on 15 May 2001. An\n                    interim judgment was granted on 20 August 2008 in divorce proceedings\n                    initiated by the Husband. At the conclusion of the ancillary hearings in\n                    Chambers on 30 October 2009, District Judge Sowaran Singh (“the\n                    District Judge”) ordered, among other things, that (i) the two children\n                    of the family should be held in joint custody, (ii) the Husband should have care\n                    and control of the children with access to the Wife on certain terms, and (iii)\n                    the Wife should transfer her rights, title and interest in the parties’\n                    matrimonial flat to the Husband with the Wife to be paid $14,000 with money from\n                    the Husband’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) account. The\n                    Wife appealed to this court under Order 55C (“O 55C”) of the\n                    Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Rules of\n                    Court”) in respect of these aspects of the District Judge’s\n                    decision. A stay of execution was ordered in respect of the District\n                    Judge’s judgment by Deputy Registrar Regina Ow-Chang Yee Lin on\n                    13 January 2010. From the initiation of the divorce up to these\n                    proceedings, the parties continued to live together with their two children at\n                    the matrimonial flat. At the time of the hearing of this appeal, the\n                    parties’ daughter is seven years old, while their son is four years\n                    old. 2       Under Notice of Appeal (Amendment No. 1), the\n                    Wife sought (i) care and control of the two children, (ii) sole discretion in\n                    determining issues relating to the education and choice of schools of the two\n                    children, and (iii) an order of sale of the matrimonial flat with her being\n                    entitled to 40% of the net proceeds of sale. 3       At the first hearing of the appeal on\n                    14 April 2010, the Wife was represented by a new counsel, Ms Grace\n                    Malathy (“Ms Malathy”). Ms Malathy sought an adjournment\n                    as she had not obtained all the documents she needed and had not prepared or\n                    served the Record of Appeal and her written submissions. I granted an\n                    adjournment. 4       By the second hearing of the appeal on\n                    28 June 2010, the Wife had filed an application on 15 June 2010 under\n                    Summons 9958 of 2010 for leave to adduce fresh affidavit evidence. I allowed the\n                    application partially. I will say more later about this\n                application. 5       The hearing of the main appeal then proceeded\n                    but in the course of Ms Malathy’s submission, she asked for leave to\n                    file an affidavit to state the Wife’s parenting plan if she was given care\n                    and control of the two children. This was in response to an inquiry from me on\n                    the same. I granted an adjournment for the Wife to file a further affidavit\n                    on: (a)     her parenting\n                    plan; (b)     any\n                        maintenance she might be seeking for the children if she was granted care\n                        and control; and (c)     whether the study courses she had attended were on a part-time or full-time\n                        basis as this was disputed. I also allowed the Husband to\n                    file an affidavit in reply. 6       The appeal was next fixed for hearing on\n                    30 July 2010. After perusing the affidavits filed I required information\n                    about the daily routine of the children to be provided by the parties. I also\n                    decided to interview the parents and the children. 7       The interview was conducted on 2 August\n                    2010. By then some information on the daily routine of the children was\n                    provided. Thereafter, the appeal was adjourned to a special date to be fixed for\n                    counsel to complete their submissions, including submissions on an alternative\n                    basis i.e. if the respective party did not achieve his or her primary\n                    objective. 8       At the final hearing of the appeal on\n                    17 September 2010, Ms Malathy applied to amend the Notice of Appeal to\n                    include prayers for (i) monthly maintenance for the children in the event the\n                    Wife was granted care and control of the children, and (ii) increased access to\n                    the children in the event she was not granted such care and control. The\n                    Husband’s counsel, Mr Mahendra S Segeram\n                    (“Mr Segeram”) objected on the basis that this was a late\n                    stage of the proceedings. 9       On the facts, it was clear that the Wife wished\n                    to seek maintenance for the children if she was granted care and control. I had\n                    also indicated to parties at the hearing on 2 August 2010 that I would like\n                    to hear their submissions on an alternative basis. For these reasons, I allowed\n                    the Wife to amend her Notice of Appeal to reflect these new\n                prayers. 10     I now come back to summons 9958 of 2010 which\n                    was an application for leave to introduce fresh affidavit evidence. I add that\n                    at the hearing on 17 September 2010, Ms Malathy also made an oral\n                    application seeking leave to file yet another further affidavit to exhibit a new\n                    letter of employment and to state when the Wife was able to return home each day\n                    after work. I will address the issue of new evidence before addressing the\n                    substantive issues.",
        "Leave to adduce fresh evidence": "",
        "Summons 9958 of 2010": "11     In Summons 9958 of 2010, the Wife prayed for\n                    leave to adduce the following pieces of additional evidence: (a)     A medical report for the Wife\n                        prepared by one Dr Lim Yun Chin (“Dr Lim”) (a\n                        psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital) dated 24 January\n                    2010. (b)     Photographs\n                        of the parties’ son with bruising/redness on his\n                    body. (c)     Photographs\n                        of a diaper with staples stapled into it. (d)     A printout of the “Frequently Asked\n                        Questions” (“FAQ”) section of the Singapore Institute\n                        of Management website indicating general information on course\n                        schedules. (e)     A\n                        photocopy of part of the Wife’s cheque book. 12     The Court’s power to admit fresh\n                    evidence at an appeal is generally controlled by the rule inLadd v Marshall(1954) 1 WLR 1489 (“Ladd v Marshall”) as applied by the Singapore\n                    courts. InLadd v Marshall, Denning LJ (as he then\n                    was) stated the three-part rule at 1491: …To justify the reception of fresh evidence… three\n                        conditions must be fulfilled: first, it must be shown that the evidence\n                        could not have been obtained with reasonable diligence for use at the trial;\n                        secondly, the evidence must be such that, if given, it would probably have\n                        an important influence on the result of the case, though it need not be\n                        decisive; thirdly, the evidence must be such as is presumably to be\n                        believed, or in other words, it must be apparently credible, though it need\n                        not be incontrovertible. Hodson LJ (as he then was) agreed, and at 1492 referred to what was\n                    then O 58 r 4 of the English Rules of the Supreme Court, which\n                    stated: The Court of Appeal shall have... full discretionary power to receive\n                        further evidence upon questions of fact... Upon appeals from a judgment\n                        after trial or hearing of any cause or matter upon the merits, such further\n                        evidence (save as to matters subsequent...) shall be admitted on special\n                        grounds only, and not without special leave of the Court. ... 13     However, the Singapore Court of Appeal\n                    qualified the operation ofLadd v Marshallin the\n                    context of registrar’s appeals in the case ofLian Soon\n                        Construction Pte Ltd v Guan Qian Realty Pte Ltd[1999]\n                    1 SLR(R) 1053 (“Lian Soon\n                        Construction”). There M Karthigesu JA,\n                    delivering the grounds of judgment of the Court of Appeal, said at\n                    [37]-[38]: 37     The position on evidence on\n                        appeals from summary judgment is found inThe Supreme\n                            Court Practice 1999at para 14/4/45: The evidence on an appeal to the Judge in\n                                    Chambers should ordinarily be the same as it was before the\n                                    Master or District Judge; but since such an appeal is dealt with\n                                    by way of an actual rehearing of the application which led to\n                                    the order under appeal, and the Judge treats the matter afresh\n                                    as though it came before him for the first time, save that the\n                                    party appealing has the right as well as the obligation to open\n                                    the appeal, it would seem that the judge in his discretion is\n                                    free to admit fresh evidence, and he frequently does so in the\n                                    absence of special reasons (see Evans v Bartlam\n                                    [1937] AC 473 at 480; Krakauer v Katz [1954]\n                                    1 WLR 278; [1954] 1 All ER 244,\n                                CA). On the other hand, the Court of Appeal does not have an unfettered\n                            discretion to receive further evidence on hearing an appeal against a\n                            summary judgment in favour of a plaintiff in proceedings under O 14 or O\n                            86 and it might do so only on 'special grounds' as provided by O 59 r\n                            10(2) within the limits laid down, per Denning LJ inLadd v Marshall... Pinsler, inSingapore Court Practice\n                            1999, agrees that this distinction should be drawn. The\n                        rationale behind the different thresholds employed in allowing evidence\n                        before a judge in chambers as compared to the Court of Appeal may be\n                        understood from an extract fromThe Supreme Court\n                            Practice 1999, at para 58/1/3: An appeal from the Master or District Judge to the Judge in Chambers\n                            is dealt with by way of an actual rehearing of the application which led\n                            to the order under appeal, and the Judge treats the matter as though it\n                            came before him for the first time, save that the party appealing, even\n                            though the original application was not by him but against him, has the\n                            right as well as the obligation to open the appeal. The Judge \"will of\n                            course give the weight it deserves to the previous decision of the\n                            Master; but he is in no way bound by it\" (perLord Atkin inEvans v\n                                Bartlam[1937] AC 473 at 478). The Judge in\n                            Chambers is in no way fettered by the previous exercise of the Master's\n                            discretion, and on appeal from the Judge in Chambers, the Court of\n                            Appeal will treat the substantial discretion as that of the Judge, and\n                            not of the Master (Evans v Bartlam, above;Cooper v Cooper[1936] WN 205; andCremin v Barjack Properties Ltd(1985)\n                            273 Est Gaz 299, CA). An appeal to the Court of Appeal also operates by way of a rehearing.\n                        Although it does not mean that witnesses are heard afresh, the court\n                        considers the whole of the evidence given below and the whole course of the\n                        trial. It is, as a rule, a rehearing on the documents of the evidence. The\n                        powers of the Court of Appeal are principally statutory, but supplemented\n                        where necessary by its inherent jurisdiction as a superior court of record.\n                        With regard to the adduction of fresh evidence before the Court of Appeal, O\n                        57 r 13(2) specifically states that \"in the case of an appeal from judgment\n                        after trial or hearing of any cause or matter on the merits\" further\n                        evidence is not to be admitted \"except on special grounds\". ... 38     ... A judge in chambers who hears an\n                        appeal from the Registrar is entitled to treat the matter as though it came\n                        before him for the first time. The judge in chambers in effect exercises\n                        confirmatory jurisdiction. The judge's discretion is in no way fettered by\n                        the decision below, and he is free to allow the admission of fresh evidence\n                        in the absence of contrary reasons. On appeal to the Court of Appeal, case\n                        law has established that the Court of Appeal will not interfere with the\n                        discretion of the judge unless satisfied that the judge's discretion has\n                        been wrongly exercised. ... The court inLian Soon Constructionthen\n                    distinguishedLian Soon Constructionfrom the case\n                    ofHua Khian Ceramics Tiles Supplies Pte Ltd v Torie\n                        Construction Pte Ltd[1991] 2 SLR(R) 901, in which theLadd v Marshallcriteria were\n                applied. 14     To answer the question of whether an appeal\n                    from a District Judge in Chambers to a Judge in Chambers should fall into the\n                    rule governing Registrar’s Appeals inLian Soon\n                        Construction, I took guidance from Karthigesu JA’s\n                    reasoning. He noted that Registrar’s Appeals (today governed by O 56\n                    of the Rules of Court) were not governed by an equivalent of O 57\n                    r 13(2) of the Rules of Court. This rule prescribes “special\n                    grounds” for the admission of further evidence before the Court of Appeal\n                    where the procedure below was a trial or hearing on the merits. I similarly\n                    observed that O 55C of the Rules of Court, which governs appeals from\n                    District Judges in Chambers to a Judge of the High Court in Chambers, does not\n                    contain an equivalent of O 55D r 11(1) of the Rules of Court which\n                    prescribes “special grounds” for the admission of further evidence\n                    in an appeal from theSubordinate Courtsto theHigh Courtafter a trial or hearing on the\n                    merits. O 55D r 1 specifically provides that O 55D does not apply\n                    to appeals from District Judges in Chambers to a High Court Judge in Chambers.\n                    In addition to reasoning from the Rules of Court, I also noted the English Court\n                    of Appeal case ofG (formerly P) v P (Ancillary Relief:\n                        Appeal)[1977] 1 WLR 1376. That case involved an appeal\n                    from an order of a registrar in ancillary matters proceedings for a husband to\n                    pay his former wife maintenance and for a division of property. The Court of\n                    Appeal found (at 1379-1380) that in appeals to a judge in chambers under both\n                    r 124 of the English Matrimonial Causes Rules 1977 and O 58 r 1\n                    of the English Rules of Supreme Court 1965 (both of which are similar to our O\n                    55C), the practice was for the judge to treat the appeal as a first instance\n                    hearing which included the freedom to admit fresh evidence. This finding was\n                    cited with approval by the House of Lords inBarder v\n                        Caluori[1988] AC 20 at 39. For these reasons I found\n                    that for this case, an appeal from a District Judge in Chambers to a High Court\n                    Judge in Chambers, I was not required to find special grounds (as described inLadd v Marshall) to allow fresh evidence to be\n                    adduced. 15     The Husband objected to the admission of all\n                    the proposed pieces of evidence based on the case ofLassiter\n                        Ann Masters v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)[2004]\n                    2 SLR(R) 392 (“Lassiter”).\n                    This was a case concerning an appeal to a Judge in Chambers from a\n                    Registrar’s assessment of damages. Chao Hick Tin JA, delivering the\n                    judgment of the Court of Appeal, specifically distinguished that case fromLian Soon Constructionat [18]: Of courseLian Soon Constructiondid not\n                        concern an appeal from an assessment of damages by the Registrar to the\n                        judge in chambers and thus the case is not strictly determinative of the\n                        present issue. Ultimately, in the specific context of an appeal from a\n                    Registrar’s assessment of damages, the court inLassiterdecided that the second and third criteria fromLadd v Marshallwould apply, but not the first\n                    (see[12]above). This decision sought to\n                    strike a balance between (i) the expediency of empowering Registrars to conduct\n                    assessments of damages, including the examination of witnesses, and (ii) the\n                    recognition, made inLian Soon Constructionand\n                    other cases, that an appeal from a Registrar to a Judge in Chambers is treated\n                    as a fresh hearing at first instance. 16     It was in this context that Chao JA made a\n                    qualifying statement at [24] ofLassiter: … [W]e are far from suggesting that a party should be free to bring\n                        in fresh evidence as he pleases. … Reasonable conditions must be set.\n                        … Sufficiently strong reasons must be shown why the new evidence was\n                        not adduced as the assessment before the Registrar. Mr Segeram relied on this statement in the context of the present\n                    case. However, as I have discussed, Chao JA’s statement was made in the\n                    context of an appeal from a Registrar’s assessment of damages, which falls\n                    under the control of the second and thirdLadd v\n                        Marshallrequirements. Fresh evidence in appeals from such\n                    procedures is treated more strictly because parties would normally have had\n                    sufficient opportunity to adduce evidence before the Registrar. In contrast, the\n                    present facts fall under the less restrictive regime described inLian Soon Construction. Mr Segeram’s citation\n                    ofLassiterwas therefore not on\n                point. 17     In the case ofWBG Network\n                        (S) Pte Ltd v Sunny Daisy Ltd[2007] 1 SLR(R) 1133\n                        (“WBG Network”) the Court of\n                    Appeal elaborated on its position inLassiter.\n                    Choo Han Teck J gave the Court’s reasoning at [13]-[14]: 13Lassiterthus recognised a distinction between the standard to be applied in appeals\n                        where there had been the characteristics of a full trial or where oral\n                        evidence had been recorded (for example, in proceedings of inquiries or, as\n                        inLassiter, in an assessment of damages) and\n                        those that were interlocutory in nature. As a result, one might not\n                        unreasonably conclude that there is a distinction between the standard to be\n                        applied for the adducing of fresh evidence in cases which are similar on the\n                        facts withLassiter(for example, in\n                        assessments of damages or inquiries), in which the second and third\n                        conditions ofLadd v Marshallshould strictly\n                        apply and those which are similar toLian Soon\n                            Construction(for example, interlocutory matters), in which\n                        the court would be allowed to exercise its discretion more liberally. The\n                        existence of a wider discretion in the latter situation however, does not\n                        mean thatLadd v Marshall cannotapply in such\n                        circumstances. Instead, the existence of such wider discretion would mean\n                        that it would be left to the court hearing any particular matter to decide\n                        whether the facts justified the application ofLadd v\n                            Marshall(and if so, to what extent). 14     A party wishing to adduce further evidence\n                        before the judge in chambers in cases where the hearing at first instance\n                        did not possess the characteristics of a trial might still have to persuade\n                        the judge hearing the matter that he had overcome all three requirements ofLadd v Marshallif he were to entertain\n                        any hope of admitting the further evidence because the judge wasentitled, though notobliged, to employ the conditions ofLadd\n                            v Marshallto help her decide whether or not to exercise her\n                        discretion to admit or reject the further evidence. In such a case, if the\n                        appellant could not persuade the judge that the conditions, if applied,\n                        would result in his favour, then it would be unlikely that the judge would\n                        allow his application to adduce the fresh evidence. [emphasis in original] 18     On the facts, I was of the opinion that the\n                    medical report prepared by Dr Lim could reasonably have been obtained and\n                    adduced at an earlier stage of the proceedings, referring to the first condition\n                    of theLadd v Marshalltest. However, applyingLian Soon Construction, this did not prevent\n                    me from admitting the report. Following the case ofWBG\n                        Network, although the second and thirdLadd v\n                        Marshallcriteria were not strictly applicable, I took reference\n                    from them as follows: the Wife’s mental health was in issue from an early\n                    stage in the ancillary matters hearings below; the report was therefore\n                    potentially of great importance in this case, meeting the second criterion.\n                    Dr Lim’s credentials as a psychiatrist from Raffles Hospital were\n                    also not in dispute, meeting the third criterion of credibility. For these\n                    reasons, I permitted the medical report to be adduced in evidence. I add that\n                    Mr Segeram did not then apply to have the Wife’s mental condition\n                    assessed by a psychiatrist of the Husband’s choice. 19     However, concerning the other pieces of\n                    evidence I came to a different ruling. The two sets of photographs (see[11](b) and (c) above) lacked sufficient\n                    context and thus did not prove anything of significant relevance to the appeal.\n                    Similarly, the FAQ from the Singapore Institute of Management did not address\n                    the Wife’s specific degree, but rather covered courses at the university\n                    in a very general way. This did not have enough probative value. Finally, the\n                    Wife submitted that the photocopy of her chequebook would prove a certain\n                    payment for the matrimonial flat was made by her rather than the Husband.\n                    However, this evidence and submission gave an incomplete and misleading picture\n                    of the payment situation in the light of contrary evidence provided in the\n                    Husband’s affidavits. As such I found that the photocopy of the\n                    Wife’s chequebook lacked credibility. For the reasons stated I did not\n                    permit the Wife to adduce any piece of fresh evidence under Summons 9958/2010\n                    other than Dr Lim’s medical report.",
        "Oral application on 17 September 2010": "20     As intimated above at[10], Ms Malathy made an oral application on\n                    17 September 2010 for leave to adduce in evidence a letter of employment\n                    dated 29 July 2010 from the Wife’s new employer and the time when she\n                    would be able to return home each day after work. 21     This evidence could certainly have been\n                    adduced earlier rather than only on 17 September 2010. However, as stated\n                    above at[14], this did not preclude me from\n                    admitting it. The Wife’s present working hours were a relevant factor in\n                    this case. In addition, no issue was raised as to the authenticity of this\n                    evidence. However, Mr Segeram objected that this evidence was only the\n                    latest of the Wife’s many changes of position, some of which were in\n                    response to the Husband’s assertions. This presented him with a moving\n                    target, making it difficult for him to submit effectively. Although I had some\n                    sympathy with the objections, in light of the relevance of the additional\n                    information I permitted the same to be adduced in evidence by way of a fresh\n                    affidavit to be filed and served by 5.00pm on 20 September\n                2010.",
        "Custody, care and control and access": "",
        "Factual background": "71     As mentioned above at[8], the Wife sought a monthly maintenance payment from the\n                    Husband for the children in the event she got care and control. In her earlier\n                    affidavit filed on 12 July 2010, the Wife stated that her gross salary from her\n                    full-time job was $2,400. She earned an additional sum of about $300 a month\n                    from her part time work. She estimated that the children’s expenses would\n                    be about $1,350 a month, while her own expenses were $800 per month. Finally,\n                    her estimated monthly mortgage payments came up to $1,000, which could be paid\n                    for through a combination of CPF moneys and cash. This gave a total income of\n                    $2,700 and a total expenditure of $3,150 per month. In her latest letter of\n                    employment dated 29 July 2010 (see[20]above), her current gross salary as a full-time Operations Executive was given\n                    as $2,275 but she did not ask for a higher maintenance from the Husband for the\n                    children even though her full-time income fell from $2,400 to\n                $2,275. 72     In his affidavit of assets and means filed on\n                    2 December 2008 the Husband estimated his income from his own business to be\n                    $2,229.17 monthly as of 2008. He assessed his monthly personal and household\n                    expenses at that time to be $2,984.01. However, it was undisputed that at\n                    present he is paying the salary, levy and medical expenses for a maid which\n                    amount to $510 a month.",
        "Effect of decision of a District Judge in Chambers on appeal to a\n                Judge in Chambers": "35     Mr Segeram cited the Court of Appeal case\n                    ofCX v CY (minor: custody and access)[2005]\n                    3 SLR(R) 690 (“CX v CY”)\n                    as authority suggesting that in child welfare cases as in all others, an\n                    appellate court should be slow to overturn an exercise of discretion by the\n                    judge below. In that case Lai Siu Chiu J said at [17]: ...We must stress that an appeal should not automatically succeed simply\n                        because the appellate court preferred a solution which the judge had not\n                        chosen. In other words, similar to the principles that apply to general\n                        appellate intervention, the appellate court should only reverse or vary a\n                        decision made by the judge below if it was exercised on wrong principles, or\n                        if the decision was plainly wrong, as would be the case if the judge has\n                        exercised his discretion wrongly. ... 36     At[13]above, I noted the Court of Appeal’s finding inLian\n                        Soon Constructionthat a Judge in Chambers hearing a\n                    Registrar’s Appeal is free to admit fresh evidence without special\n                    grounds. Karthigesu JA stated the rationale for this at [37] of that case which\n                    I have set out above. 37CX v CYwas an\n                    appeal to the Court of Appeal from a decision of a Judge in Chambers. From my\n                    reading, I find thatCX v CYas cited by\n                    Mr Segeram is part of a line of authority stating that the Court of Appeal\n                    will not readily interfere with the exercise of discretion of a judge. Based onLian Soon Construction, this is not applicable\n                    to Registrar’s Appeals as such appeals are treated as hearings at first\n                    instance before a Judge in Chambers unfettered by the decision below. As I have\n                    found above at[14], an application ofLian Soon Constructionand interpretation of\n                    the Rules of Court show that appeals from a District Judge in Chambers to a High\n                    Court Judge in Chambers are not subject to special rules for the adducing of\n                    fresh evidence. From the material cited above at[13], the reason for this is that such appeals are treated as\n                    first instance hearings in the same manner as Registrar’s Appeals.\n                    Following from this, the rule cited by Mr Segeram inCX\n                        v CYis similarly inapplicable to such appeals and to the present\n                    facts. 38     The High Court decision ofLouis Pius Gilbert v Louis Anne Lise[1999]\n                    3 SLR(R) 402 (“Louis Pius\n                    Gilbert”) states a contrary view. In that case the High Court\n                    Judge in Chambers hearing an appeal from a District Judge in Chambers took the\n                    view (at [15]) that sitting as an appeal court, he “should not not\n                    interfere with the decision of a court of first instance unless it is so far out\n                    of line as to be perverse, or unless the lower court has clearly gone wrong on\n                    principle.” This statement was in turn taken verbatim fromSoh Chan Soon v Tan Choon Yock[1998] SGHC 204\n                        (“Soh Chan Soon”) at [4] per\n                    Warren Khoo L H J. However, unlikeLouis Pius\n                        Gilbert, that appeal was from a District Court to a High Court\n                    (not a Judge in Chambers) under Order 55D of the Rules of Court and not\n                    O 55C. Such appeals arenottreated as fresh\n                    first instance hearings. I therefore distinguish the present case fromSoh Chan Soonand I decline to applyLouis Pius Gilberton this issue. 39     In any event, I find that there are sufficient\n                    grounds for me to depart from the District Judge’s decision. This is\n                    partly based on the evidence before this court that was not available at\n                    proceedings below, which I will elaborate on in my findings.",
        "Findings on custody": "40     InCX v CY, the\n                    Court of Appeal firmly endorsed the view that joint custody should be the norm\n                    in custody orders. Quoting Lai Siu Chiu J at [38]: We would emphasise that recent decisions have been inclined towards making\n                        joint or no custody orders due to the need to ensure that the child becomes\n                        attached to both parents. The idea behind joint or no custody orders is to\n                        ensure that neither parent has a better right over the child and that both\n                        have a responsibility to bring the child up in the best way possible.\n                        Similarly, the child has a right to the guidance of both his parents. 41     In light of this principle, I do not think the\n                    Wife should be granted sole discretion on the children’s educational\n                    matters and choice of schools. I see no reason to exclude the Husband from\n                    participating in those decisions. The Wife strikes me as a stubborn and\n                    determined individual, willing to go to great lengths to pursue what is best in\n                    her own opinion. Her willingness to rely on a false address to register her\n                    daughter for primary school ([34]above) and\n                    her flexibility with the truth before this court (noted below at[51]) gives me the impression that she is\n                    accustomed to doing as she pleases without much sense of restraint. The\n                    Husband’s views should apply to act as a balance. In any event the\n                    Husband, as the father, should have his say. 42     For the reasons stated I find the children\n                    should be held in joint custody by both parties without\n                qualification.",
        "Findings on care and control": "43     The District Judge granted care and control to\n                    the Husband based on two factors: (i) the harshness of the Wife’s\n                    disciplinary methods and (ii) concerns that the Wife’s mental health made\n                    her an unsuitable caregiver. He recommended that both parties attend the\n                    Parenting Workshop organised by the Family Courts to improve their parenting\n                    skills. The District Judge also allowed the issue of care and control to be\n                    reviewed after six months, but this was unnecessary as there was a stay on his\n                    order. 44     Generally speaking, a mother’s bond with\n                    young children is stronger than that of a father’s. This was described by\n                    the Court of Appeal inSoon Peck Wah v Woon Che\n                        Chye[1997] 3 SLR(R) 430 (“Soon Peck Wah”) at [45] per Yong Pung How CJ: All other things being equal, a very important factor to bear in mind was\n                        that we were dealing with an extremely young infant. We felt that the\n                        maternal bond between the appellant and the infant was a pivotal\n                        consideration here. The bond between the natural mother and her child is one\n                        of the most unexplainable wonders of human nature. It should never be taken\n                        for granted or slighted. We have all heard of the story of the mother who\n                        fought a tiger with her bare hands to save her child from the ferocious\n                        beast. Such is the love and sacrifice of the maternal instinct. Since the\n                        beginning of civilisation to this age of consumer materialism, the mother's\n                        love for her child remains just as strong and unchanging. This court would\n                        be doing a disservice to justice and humanity if it turned a blind eye to\n                        the most fundamental bond of mankind - between a mother and her child, by\n                        taking the child away from the mother. ...It is only a natural conclusion\n                        that, by reason of his very tender, young age, the infant would be most\n                        dependent on his mother for his physical and psychological needs. In the\n                        best interest of the child's welfare, we should not deprive him of his\n                        mother's love and care. InSoon Peck Wah, the child in question\n                    was four years old. The parties’ son in this case is also four years old,\n                    with the daughter being seven years old. 45     I understand from the parties that the current\n                    childcare arrangement involves some division of responsibility between both\n                    parents. However, I accept the Wife’s evidence that she had been the\n                    primary caregiver for the children from the start of the marriage to the time of\n                    these proceedings even though I accept the Husband’s assertion that when\n                    the Wife was attending study courses she did so as a full-time student. I find\n                    that the Wife prepares many of the children’s meals, helps them with\n                    schoolwork and takes them out for leisure and enrichment activities. As for the\n                    evidence that her latest full-time job allows her to return home to her children\n                    at around 6.00pm, I am not unaware that her part-time work (such as financial\n                    consultancy or property agency work) may cause her to return later on occasion.\n                    I note that the children continue to sleep with the Wife even after the divorce\n                    proceedings had been initiated. This suggests that separating the children from\n                    the Wife would be more traumatic and disruptive for them than separating them\n                    from the Husband. I also note that the Wife has carried out her primary\n                    caregiving role since the District Judge’s decision on 30 October\n                    2009 without repeating any threat of suicide, which is significant as her mental\n                    health was a major issue in this appeal. 46     I now address the issue of mental health,\n                    which was the main issue at the hearing below. It was not in dispute that the\n                    Wife did threaten to commit suicide at least once. The District Judge below made\n                    the finding that she had done so at least three times. In coming to this\n                    conclusion the District Judge relied on the confidential Social Welfare Report.\n                    In light of this reliance, I will say that in the report the Welfare Officer\n                    received information that the Wife had threatened suicide on three separate\n                    occasions from the Husband himself. In my view, even if the Wife had threatened\n                    only once to commit suicide alone, that would already be a factor against the\n                    granting of care and control to her. It follows that if she had threatened to\n                    commit suicide more than once and/or threatened the children as well that would\n                    be even more troubling. I accept that it is likely that she did threaten to\n                    commit suicide more than once, and at one time, her threat included the\n                    children. 47     However, having regard to the report by\n                    Dr Lim, I do not think her mental health is so precarious as to swing the\n                    issue of care and control in favour of the Husband. As quoted above (at[29]), Dr Lim’s report stated\n                    that even at the time of her initial diagnosis at IMH it was implied that the\n                    Wife’s reactive depression was temporary and would be resolved by the\n                    resolution of her marriage. Very importantly, Dr Lim examined the Wife on\n                    1 December 2009 and stated that in his opinion she did not suffer from any\n                    psychiatric impairment that would inhibit her from caring for her children. He\n                    also said she did not require any psychiatric follow-up at the\n                moment. 48     I was guided by the Court of Appeal’s\n                    decision inSoon Peck Wah(cited above at[44]). In that case, the judge at the\n                    firstinter parteshearing did not grant the\n                    mother interim custody, care and control of the child in part because she was\n                    suffering from post-natal depression coupled with thyrotoxicosis, conditions\n                    which caused her to be emotionally unstable; she had frequent outbursts,\n                    initiated arguments and on one occasion threatened to use a knife against the\n                    father’s family if he failed to return the child to her (Soon Peck Wahat [13](a)). About a year and a half\n                    later, the mother applied to the same judge for variation on the basis of a\n                    change of circumstances, namely that her medical reports showed that her\n                    depression and thyrotoxicosis had been successfully treated, with the symptoms\n                    of the latter reduced to “mild hand fine tremors and mild\n                    tachycardia” (at [14]). The judge refused to grant variation partly on\n                    the basis that the mother’s thyrotoxicosis was controlled by medication\n                    rather than being cured altogether (at [17]). The Court of Appeal disagreed with\n                    this finding, and found that the favourable reports of both her doctors showed\n                    that her conditions had been successfully treated notwithstanding that she was\n                    still on follow-up medication (at [38] and [40]). Partly on this basis (at\n                    [42]), the Court was willing to grant her interim custody, care and control. On\n                    the present facts, the Wife has also produced a medical report by Dr Lim\n                    declaring that she has no mental disorder. In fact, Dr Lim opined that the\n                    Wife does not require medication or follow-up in relation to her condition\n                    unlike the mother inSoon Peck Wah. 49     I also found the case ofCheok Wah Jin v Guo Xiao Ying (m.w.)[2003] SGDC 72\n                        (“Cheok Wah Jin”) persuasive. In\n                    that case, the mother was diagnosed with acute psychosis and was treated at IMH\n                    between 16 August 1997 and 31 October 1997. Subsequently, she was\n                    examined by a doctor on 7 and 11 March 2002 and pronounced to be free of\n                    psychotic features, having made a satisfactory recovery. District Judge Koh Juat\n                    Jong “saw no reason to doubt the assessment of the doctor” (at\n                    [40]) and on the basis of the doctor’s report found the mother capable of\n                    taking care of the children. I note that inCheok Wah\n                        Jin, despite the father’s allegation, District Judge Koh\n                    did not find that the mother had actually attempted suicide. In contrast, the\n                    Wife’s attempted suicide in this case is on the public record. Another\n                    difference is that the mother in theCheok Wah Jincase had a history of psychosis, while the Wife in this case was diagnosed by\n                    IMH as having reactive depression. However, like the mother inCheok Wah Jin, the Wife was medically examined by a\n                    doctor and was not assessed to have any mental disorder. In bothCheok Wah Jinand on the present facts, the patients\n                    were assessed not to require further treatment. 50     I accept Dr Lim’s psychiatric\n                    assessment of the Wife. Based on all the evidence I am of the view that the\n                    Wife’s present mental health does not prevent her from caring for the\n                    children well. This is supported by her conduct in childcare from 2007 to the\n                    present proceedings, during which time she did not threaten suicide or threaten\n                    to harm the children. 51     Concerning the Wife’s theft conviction,\n                    I find it hard to believe the Wife’s explanation that the circumstances\n                    she mentioned caused her to take unpurchased items and then to plead guilty to\n                    committing theft. I think that she was not being forthcoming with the court, a\n                    fact that does not reflect well on her at this appeal notwithstanding that her\n                    offence was a one-time incident. The Husband also argued against her explanation\n                    that the incident was triggered by stressful circumstances. However, as I do not\n                    find that the Wife’s acts were triggered by the particular incident she\n                    mentioned, I do not find the episode indicative of any instability on her part,\n                    though her character is called into question. 52     On the other general childcare issues, I find\n                    based on the Social Welfare Report that the Wife’s methods of discipline\n                    are somewhat harsher than the Husband’s. In fairness, the Husband also\n                    disciplines the children by spanking them with his hands; but I am of the view\n                    that the Wife is more ready to resort to harsher methods. Nevertheless, this\n                    difference did not weigh heavily in my decision even when considered together\n                    with allegations about her mental condition. I note from his Grounds of Decision\n                    that the District Judge ordered both parents to attend a Parenting Workshop to\n                    improve their parenting skills. It will be in the interest of the children that\n                    the parties build up their parenting abilities regardless of whether they have\n                    care and control or not. 53     In terms of care-giving arrangements, the Wife\n                    holds both full-time and part-time work (whether in one or two part-time\n                    occupations is not clear). In her submissions, she stated that her job afforded\n                    her more flexibility to care for the children compared to the Husband, who is\n                    self-employed. However, I note that as of 12 July 2010, her proposal is to\n                    rely on childcare and/or a domestic helper to care for the children for most of\n                    the hours of the day. As such I find that her suggested care arrangements are\n                    basically similar to the Husband’s, who also proposes to engage a domestic\n                    helper to care for the children. Both parties also propose to rely on extended\n                    family for help: the Husband on his sisters-in-law and the Wife on her mother.\n                    However, the Wife indicated that her mother currently has no right of permanent\n                    residence in Singapore. 54     The Husband asserted that the Wife had\n                    threatened to permanently remove the children from Singapore to China. I presume\n                    he was also suggesting that granting care and control to the Wife would somehow\n                    facilitate the children’s removal. Parties are reminded that if either of\n                    them attempts to subvert any order granted by the court it will result in\n                    adverse consequences for that party. I do not think that the risk that the Wife\n                    might remove the children from the jurisdiction is a weighty factor against\n                    granting care and control to her. 55     The Husband also argued that the Wife was\n                    seeking care and control only to facilitate an application for public housing.\n                    This point was based on the Wife’s evidence in affidavits filed for the\n                    ancillary matters hearing below, wherein she sought the transfer of the whole of\n                    the matrimonial flat into her sole name. The Wife did not pursue title to the\n                    matrimonial flat in this appeal. While a grant of care and control to the Wife\n                    might allow her access to certain housing arrangements that she might not\n                    otherwise have had, I find that this does not of itself suggest that she is\n                    seeking care and control for a collateral purpose at the expense of the\n                    children’s welfare. 56     On the whole, I find the Husband to be a\n                    person of better character and more integrity than the Wife. As noted in this\n                    judgment, the Wife proved herself dishonest in the course of these proceedings\n                    in some ways. However, in spite of all this the children seem closer to their\n                    mother than to their father (although this is not to say that they are not also\n                    close to their father). 57     It seems the present childcare arrangement\n                    involves some role for both parents and frequent contact between the children\n                    and parents. I attempted to persuade the parties to continue the current living\n                    arrangements with joint care and control granted to both, but the Husband found\n                    the idea of continuing to live under the same roof as the Wife intolerable. This\n                    being the case, for the reasons noted above and in consideration of all the\n                    evidence I find it in the best interest of the parties’ two children that\n                    the Wife be granted care and control. However, the Husband should be granted\n                    liberal access, the details of which I will discuss below. Regarding the\n                    Wife’s intended childcare arrangements, in my opinion childcare may not\n                    suffice for the children’s needs in light of the Wife’s possibly\n                    long working hours (in both full-time and part-time work). A domestic helper\n                    would seem to provide a more sustainable solution; but ultimately the Wife is to\n                    make the decision as the person with care and control.",
        "Findings on access": "58     Mr Segeram submitted that in the event\n                    that the Husband did not get care and control, he seeks the following\n                    access: (a)     weekday access on Monday,\n                        Wednesday and Friday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm; (b)     in the event that he cannot accommodate the\n                        children overnight, weekend access every Sunday from 9.00am to\n                        8.00pm; (c)     in the\n                        event that he can accommodate the children overnight, weekend access in a\n                        two-week cycle from 6.00pm on Friday to 8.00pm on Saturday on one week and\n                        from 9.00am on Saturday to 9.00am on Sunday for the other\n                    week; (d)     access for\n                        half of every school holiday; and (e)     access on every public holiday from 9.00am to 2.00pm,\n                        except for every first day of the Chinese New Year, during which access\n                        should be from 9.00am to 8.00pm. Based on the fact that\n                    the children are close to the Husband and that they are used to him playing an\n                    active part in caring for them, I grant the Husband liberal access on the\n                    following terms: (a)     weekday access on Monday, Wednesday\n                        and Friday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm; (b)     weekend access on Saturday from 9.00am to 8.00pm if the\n                        Husband cannot accommodate the children overnight or from 6.00pm on Friday\n                        to 8.00pm on Saturday if he can. This is simpler than alternating weekend\n                        access and will allow the Wife to take the children to church on\n                        Sundays; (c)     access on alternate public holidays, except Chinese New Year, from 9.00am\n                        to 2.00pm; (d)     access on Chinese New Year on an alternate basis i.e. on the first day of\n                        Chinese New Year from 9.00am to 8.00pm in one year and in the next year on\n                        the second day of Chinese New Year from 9.00am to 8.00pm;\n                    and (e)     access for\n                        half of every school holiday.",

I summarise and elaborate on my decision as follows: (a)     For the two children of the\n                        parties’ marriage, both parties to have joint custody with care and\n                        control to the Wife and liberal access to the Husband as follows: (i)       weekday access on Monday,\n                            Wednesday and Friday from 6.00pm to 8.00pm; (ii)       in the event that he cannot\n                            accommodate the children overnight, weekend access every Saturday from\n                            9.00am to 8.00pm; but in the event that he can accommodate the children\n                            overnight, weekend access every week from 6.00pm on Friday to 8.00pm on\n                            Saturday; (iii)       access on alternate public holidays, except\n                            Chinese New Year, from 9.00am to 2.00pm; (iv)       access on Chinese New Year on an\n                            alternate basis i.e. on the first day of Chinese New Year from 9.00am to\n                            8.00pm in one year and in the next year on the second day of Chinese New\n                            Year from 9.00am to 8.00pm; and (v)       access for half of every school holiday with the\n                            details to be agreed between the parties, failing which they are to make\n                            an appointment to address me on this issue before the extraction of the\n                            order; (b)     The parties are to agree on arrangements for taking the children on\n                        holidays overseas or to make an appointment to address me on this issue\n                        before the extraction of the order. (c)     The Husband is to pay the Wife $800 monthly as\n                        maintenance for their children with effect from the first day of the month\n                        after she moves out from the matrimonial flat with the children and\n                        thereafter on the first day of every month. (d)     For the avoidance of doubt, no maintenance is to\n                        be payable to the Wife for herself. (e)     The matrimonial flat is to be sold in the open market\n                        within six months from the date of the order with the cost and expense of\n                        the sale being paid by the Husband and the proceeds of sale divided between\n                        the parties with $14,000 to the Wife and the remainder to the Husband after\n                        the outstanding loan is paid. The Husband is to have an option to purchase\n                        the Wife’s interest in the matrimonial flat for\n                    $14,000. (f)     I also\n                        allow both parties liberty to apply. (g)     Both parties to bear their own\n                costs. 77     As decided by the District Judge below: (a)     Both parties are to attend the\n                        Parenting Workshop arranged by the Family Court. (b)     Both parties are to keep all other\n                        assets in their own names."
