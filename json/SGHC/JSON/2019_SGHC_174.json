        "Application of the principle of escalation with regard to the respondent’s antecedents": "67 An application of the principles elucidated above shows that this was not an appropriate case for the principle of escalation to apply. There is no doubt that the respondent has a history of similar offending. He has a long list of antecedents precisely because of his failure to control his sexually-driven desire to steal the wallets of his female victims. The fact of his re-offending alone would thereforeprima facieweigh in favour of applying the principles of escalation and specific deterrence. However, in my judgment, it is clear that the District Judge had already accommodated the need for specific deterrence in the sentence he imposed, given that the aggregate sentence of 10 months’ imprisonment was an objectively high one that could only be justified on the basis of the respondent’s antecedents and the need for such deterrence. As the learned Deputy Public Prosecutor agreed, the general starting point for a first time offender committing a similar offence would likely have been a fine: see the GD at [32] and [40]. 68   Next, a comparison of the present offences with the respondent’s antecedents does not show an escalating pattern of behaviour. It is common ground that for the 1st Charge and the 3rd Charge, almost immediately after stealing wallets from his victims, the respondent left the wallets with either the information counter or the cashier before leaving the scene. 69 As for the 2nd Charge, I note that the respondent’s account was disputed by the Prosecution: see [12] above. Nevertheless, I was prepared to accept his account (as the District Judge did in the GD at [37]) that he had remained at the scene feeling conflicted, and intending to return the wallet. After all, the SOF states that he had moved to an adjacent shelf and “loitered around” until he was apprehended. It was undisputed that in all three instances of theft, the respondent had not, as he was wont to, proceeded to a public toilet to use the wallet to fulfil his sexual urges (see [19] above). The fact that the wallets were returned was also a departure from the respondent’s usual offending conduct, which was to throw away or keep the stolen items, as he had in 2014 (see [16] above). 70 Turning to the respondent’s characteristics, as I have made clear at [52] and [55] above, specific deterrence had to be attenuated somewhat given that the respondent was suffering from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood at that time. This too had to be considered in the context of the principle of escalation, because the respondent hadnotbeen diagnosed with an adjustment disorder or with depressive symptoms at the time of the 2014 offences unlike the previous occasion, when the offences had evidently been committed in order to satisfy his fetishistic disorder. On this occasion, his offences were to be seen in the context of an overarching endeavour to alleviate his depressive symptoms and stressors. In other words, the current offences featured mitigating factors that were absent in his antecedents. 71 In my judgment, the District Judge was also right to have placed mitigating weight on the fact that the respondent hadvoluntarilyattended the 30 psychotherapy sessions: see the GD at [37]. As Dr Cheok indicated, the respondent needs to continue “with his treatment on a long term basis to reduce the risk of reoffending”. Voluntary efforts made toward what is theonlyviable hope for desistance should be acknowledged and encouraged, which is precisely what the District Judge had done. Although the respondent had re-offended while undergoing treatment, this does not mean that such treatment was wholly ineffective. After all, the respondent did feel remorse immediately after each theft, and on the third occasion, he returned the wallet even before he was apprehended. In any event, the District Judge had given effect to the need for deterrence on account of the respondent’s re-offending while on bail by choosing to run the sentences consecutively: see the GD at [42]. 72 In the round, I agreed with the District Judge that this was not an offender in respect of whom the principle of escalation would demand a sentence of similar, or heavier severity as compared to the last sentence he had served: see the GD at [39]. The principle of proportionality 73 I turn to the principle of proportionality, which the District Judge had alluded to at [39] of his GD. The principle has been expounded upon at some length by our courts (seePublic Prosecutor v Law Aik Meng[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 at [30];NFat [75];Tan KayBengat [31];Lim Ghim Peowat [19];Mohamed Shouffee bin Adam v Public Prosecutor[2014] 2 SLR 998 at [47]–[50] and [63]; andASRat [128]–[133] and [146]–[158]). It suffices for me to touch upon just two aspects of proportionality that arose in the present case. 74 First, the application of the principle of escalation in fact incorporates the safeguard of proportionality. Hence, before a court imposes an uplift on an accused person’sprevious sentences, there must be a careful comparison with the accused person’sprevious offending. And while specific deterrence may sometimes justify a stiffer sentence, the law is clear that this “cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence” (Veen v The Queen (No 2)(1988) 164 CLR 465 (“Veen (No 2)”), at 477 cited inNFat [66]). Were it otherwise, the offender would in effect be punished a second time for his original offence. 75 An index offence does not need to be of equivalent severity (for example, in property offences, be of equivalent value) before a heavier sentence might be imposed by virtue of re-offending. But there may be situations where the index offence is much less egregious than the accused person’s last antecedent. An equivalent or heavier sentence could be disproportionate then, since it might be predicated on the wrong factual basis. Conversely, where the index offence is much more egregious, then proportionality may in fact demand a significantly heavier sentence to take account of the marked escalation in the accused person’s offending. What is essential is for the sentencing court to undertake a comparison of thegravityof the antecedent and the index offences, and consider how this should affect the sentence to be imposed for the index offence. 76 In order to have the correct factual basis for applying the principle of escalation, a sentencing court should also be alert to the fact that reference solely to an accused person’s antecedents in the form of the Criminal Records Office (“CRO”) record may be insufficient. The CRO record typically indicates the offences the accused person had been charged with, and the sentences imposed in respect of those charges. In order to have a fuller comparison between the index offence and the antecedent offence, it might sometimes be helpful or necessary to have reference to, among other things, the charges, statement of facts, psychiatric reports, and grounds of decision (where available). It is not every case where this will be called for – but certainly where the principle of escalation is in play, a court should endeavour to have as complete a picture as practicable. 77 Second, the principle of proportionality also applies in the comparison between theseverityof the sentence imposed for the index offence and thegravityof the index offence in the context of the offender’s circumstances: see generally,Angliss Singapore Pte Ltd v Public Prosecutor[2006] 4 SLR(R) 653 at [25]. This consideration remains in playeven aftertaking into account an accused person’s antecedent record. Hence, inASRat [127], the Court of Appeal considered the case ofIskandar bin Muhamad Nordin v Public Prosecutor[2006] 1 SLR(R) 265 (“Iskandar”). The Court of Appeal alluded to the High Court’s decision to increase the offender’s sentence to 24 months’ imprisonment and nine strokes of the cane for a charge of outrage of modesty under s 354 of the Penal Code as potentially disproportionate. Given that the offender was 18 years old (with an IQ of 58), his two prior convictions for theft ought not to have displaced rehabilitation as the predominant sentencing objective. Similarly, inSim Yeow Keeat [97], a special three-judge bench of the High Court had observed that the sentence inTan Ngin Hai v Public Prosecutor[2001] 2 SLR(R) 152 (“Tan Ngin Hai”) of eight years’ preventive detention was wholly disproportionate to the index offence involving the theft of $1.10. Given that considerations of proportionality are attenuated in the context of preventive detention, they should more robustly apply in cases involving regular imprisonment even after the accused person’s antecedent record has been factored into the calculus. 78 The principle of proportionality is also a reflection of the principle of retribution. The “true meaning oflex talionis(an eye for an eye and tooth for tooth) was never retribution [as vengeance] but proportionality”:Public Prosecutor v Tan FookSum[1999] 1 SLR(R) 1022 at [17], citing Tan Yock Lin,Criminal Procedure(1997), ch XVIII, at para 553. As was considered inASRat [129] and [131], the principle of retribution emphasises the relationship between the punishment for the harm which results from the index offence and the offender’s culpability. This is contrasted with the other sentencing objectives of prevention, deterrence, and rehabilitation, which are geared toward the beneficial consequences to society at large. 79 Beyond determining the appropriate sentence in the instant case, the principle of proportionality alsoflowsout from the principle of retribution and exerts “a much broader influence” on the process than the other sentencing considerations: seeASRat [130]. As the learned commentators of “Disproportionate Sentences as Human Rights Violations” (2004) 67 MLR 541 (Dirk van Zyl Smit and Andrew Ashworth, eds), at 546 have observed, citingS v Dodo2001 (3) SA 382 (CC), at 403–404: 38 …Where the length of a sentence, which has been imposed because of its general deterrent effect on others, bears no relation to the gravity of the offence…, the offender is being used essentially as a means to another end and the offender’s dignity assailed… 80 Proportionality prevents an offender from simply being used as a means to an end: see Morris J Fish, “An Eye for an Eye: Proportionality as a Moral Principle of Punishment” (2008) 28 OJLS 57, at 68.  The principle acts as acounterweightagainst the more goal-driven sentencing considerations of prevention, deterrence and rehabilitation. In essence, proportionality is a check –pulling backon theextentto which the other sentencing considerations weigh into the calculus. 81 Hence, in my view, decisions such asIskandarandTan Ngin Haishould not be followed because they do not give effect to the principle of proportionality. The point simply is this: even if the weight given to the need for incapacitation and protection of the public was pressing in those cases, this nonethelessstillhad to be assessed against the severity of the index offence. While this assessment is necessarily a fact-specific and contextual one, requiring a “judgment of experience and discernment” (Veen (No 2), at 474), it cannot be disregarded. Similarly, as the High Court has observed inSaiful Rizam bin Assimat [41], even though the need to rehabilitate an offender may be for his and society’s benefit, such a need cannot result in a disproportionate sentence. It must be situated within a consideration of whether the sentence imposed was commensurate with the wrong committed. 82 I would close my observations on this by noting that proportionality as a counterweight can also act in the opposite direction. As our courts have elaborated, where the harm occasioned by the offence and the offender’s culpability is sufficiently grave, retribution may prevail against the needs of rehabilitation: seeLim Ghim Peowat [39] (and as considered at [44(g)] above); see alsoNg Jun Xian v Public Prosecutor[2017] 3 SLR 933 at [36]. This understanding of proportionality as a check therefore coheres with a sentencing court’s role in balancing seemingly incommensurate considerations. As I noted at the outset of this judgment, the principle of proportionality is not in conflict with, but in fact complements the other sentencing principles. Application of the principle of proportionality to the index offences 83 I had at [73]–[75] above assessed the principle of proportionality in the context of the respondent’s antecedents. It suffices here to consider the principle of proportionality with regard to the index offences. In the present case, the District Judge considered that a sentence of two years’ imprisonment would be disproportionate given that no loss had been caused to the victims: see the GD at [39]. In my judgment, he was correct to have done so. As I observed inGan Chai Bee Anne v Public Prosecutor[2019] SGHC 42 (“Anne Gan”) at [63], full restitution may substantially reduce the economic harm suffered by the victim. It bears noting that inAnne Gan, full restitution was effected about four years after the fraudulent scheme first began. This was to remedy the loss of a substantial sum of $77,546.40. It also bears noting that there, restitution was in fact undertaken byanotheroffender, and not the offender herself. In the present case, the value of the items stolen was relatively low to begin with. The respondent had personally returned the wallets to the counter in the 1st and 3rd Charges, and had done so almost immediately. It therefore could not be said that the victims had suffered any economic loss, nor had they been deprived of their property for a substantial period of time. There was also no indication that the respondent had committed any of the offences to monetarily benefit himself. 84 I did not accept the Prosecution’s submission that the lack of economic harm to the victims was at best a neutral factor because the respondent’s thefts were not aimed at economic gain, but at sexual gratification. First, in the context of the offence of theft, economic harm is the most obvious proxy of harm. Furthermore, in this instance, the lack of economic harm was not merely fortuitous, but had to do with the fact that the respondent had returned the wallets, because as the District Judge found, he was feeling conflicted over the offence in the immediate aftermath of their commission. Moreover, in neither of the proceeded charges was there evidence that the respondent had actually used the stolen wallets to fulfil his sexual urges. Although a custodial sentence was called for, considerations of proportionality with regard to his antecedents and the index offences would almost certainly weigh in favour of a lighter sentence. The respondent’s rehabilitative prospects 85 Although specific deterrence was the primary sentencing consideration, this did not in and of itself mean that rehabilitation was completely displaced as a consideration. In this regard, the Prosecution had submitted that rehabilitation was irrelevant and that efforts at rehabilitation were wholly ineffective. The respondent was a “menace to society and should be incarcerated for a substantial period of time”. 86 For a start, it seems to me that the Prosecution’s case was somewhat contradicted by its own sentencing position. If the Prosecution were truly of the view that the respondent was incorrigible and, as it claimed, “likely to be the very worst kind of offender” then surely it should have been seeking more than two years’ imprisonment. But by its own account, its sentencing position of two years’ imprisonment was “far from the maximum” of six years’ imprisonment if the sentences for the two proceeded charges were to run consecutively. This seemed to me to suggest that the Prosecution itself did not seriously consider the respondent’s index offences to be of such seriousness as to foreclose any redemptive prospects. 87 I was also not persuaded by the Prosecution’s submission that the respondent was non-compliant with his medication, which then cast doubt on the respondent’s willingness to be rehabilitated. While the Prisons’ email did indicate that the respondent had “declined … medication as he reported that he did not benefit from it before coming to prison…”, the following paragraph also indicated that the Prisons psychiatrist, Dr Jacob Rajesh had noted that “the role of psychiatric medications in treating fetishism is very limited…”. I accept that in the ordinary case, the principle of deterrence may apply to a mentally disordered offender who consciously chooses to be non-compliant with his medication:Public Prosecutor v Goh Lee Yin[2008] 1 SLR(R) 824 at [95]. However, I did not accept that the respondent should be characterised in that way. 88 The Prosecution also suggested that because the respondent was not a youthful offender, this militated in favour of a longer term of imprisonment.  While there is apresumption of a capacityfor rehabilitation for youthful offenders, this does not whollydisplacethe rehabilitative principle when sentencing older offenders: seeSim Wen Yi Ernest v Public Prosecutor[2016] 5 SLR 207 at [40]. 89 The Prosecution’s alternative submission was that if rehabilitation was at all possible it should be achieved through a substantial term of imprisonment citingTan Yao Min v Public Prosecutor[2018] 3 SLR 1134. The relevant passages are at [45]–[47]: 45 As held by the Court of Appeal inLim Ghim Peow([30]supra) at [38], and the High Court inChong Hou En([30]supra) at [67], rehabilitation is not incompatible with a lengthier term of imprisonment and can take place in prison. However, the High Court inChong Hou Enalso cautioned that particular care must be taken when calibrating the global sentence so that it is not crushing and does not destroy any hope of recovery or reintegration (at [67]). 46 The appellant appeared to have benefited from his term in the juvenile home, and was assessed to have made some therapeutic progress on release. He had variously expressed that he was keen to pursue his education and stop his offending behaviour. The 2015 Psychologist’s Report noted that he “expressed a desire to lead an offence-free lifestyle in the community and importantly to continue his education”. In the 2017 Psychiatric Reports, the appellant told Dr Cheow thathe “wanted to be sent to prison so he could retake his O levels”. It is hoped that, with a longer term of imprisonment, he will be able to make progress in his goals of rehabilitating himself, pursuing his studies and complying with therapy recommendations. 47 The District Judge held that specific deterrence and protection of the public outweighed rehabilitation in the present case (the GD at [27]). While I agreed that specific deterrence and protection of the public necessitated a relatively lengthy imprisonment term,rehabilitation within a structured environment would also conceivably be better achieved with an imprisonment term in the present case. [Emphases added.] 90 It was clear from this that See Kee Oon J was concerned with rehabilitation within astructured environment, particularly with regard to compliance with therapy recommendations as well as the appellant’s educational aspirations in that case. Although there was some evidence in the Prisons’ email of “psychological interventions” that would be administered to the respondent during his incarceration, there was no evidence that the structured confines of imprisonment would bemore effectivein treating the respondent in this regard, and would therefore justify a longer stint of incarceration. In fact, when asked, Dr Yeo explicitly declined to make that assessment.   Observations on the Mandatory Treatment Order regime 91 On the other hand, aside from imprisonment, there was a lack of available sentencing options that could facilitate the respondent’s compliance with psychotherapy. The respondent was precluded from community orders such as a Mandatory Treatment Order (“MTO”) under s 339 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC 2012”). This is because ss 337 and 339 of the CPC 2012 provide: Community orders 337.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3), a court shall not exercise any of its powers under this Part to make any community order in respect of — … (e)a person who had previously been sentenced to reformative training,corrective training or preventive detention. (2) A court may not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of any case referred to in subsection (1) except that it may do so under section 339 even if the offender — (a) had previously been sentenced to aterm of imprisonment, whether or not it is a term of imprisonment served by him in default of payment of a fine… … Mandatory treatment orders 339.—(1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), where an offender is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make a mandatory treatment order requiring the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 24 months. … [Emphases added.] 92 Hence, because of the stint of preventive detention that the respondent had served from 2000, the court was statutorily precluded from making an MTO as a result of s 337(1)(e) of the CPC 2012. Although s 337(2)(a) of the CPC 2012 afforded an exception for those who had previously served a “term of imprisonment”, the High Court has held that “[a] sentence of preventive detention is not a “sentence of imprisonment”, even though persons sentenced to preventive detention are often, in practice, detained in prison”:Nicholas Kenneth v Public Prosecutor[2003] 1 SLR(R) 80 at [19]. 93 The recent amendments to the CPC by way of the Criminal Justice Reform Act (No 19 of 2018) have reaffirmed this position. Hence, ss 337 and 339 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“the CPC 2018”) prescribe: Community orders 337.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) and (3),a court shall not exercise any of its powers under this Part to make any community orderin respect of — … (d) a person who had previously been sentenced to a term of imprisonment exceeding 3 months, other than a term of imprisonment served by him in default of a fine; (e)a person who had previously been sentenced to corrective training or preventive detention; … (g) a person who has been admitted — (i) at least twice to an approved institution under section 34 of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap. 185) (called in this section an approved institution); (ii) at least twice to an approved centre under section 17 of the Intoxicating Substances Act (Cap. 146A) (called in this section an approved centre); or (iii) at least once to an approved institution, and at least once to an approved centre; … (2)A court may not make a mandatory treatment order in respect of any case referred to in subsection (1)except that it may do so under section 339 even if the offender — (a) is a person mentioned in subsection (1)(d)or(g)… … Mandatory treatment orders 339.—(1) Subject to subsections (2), (3) and (4), where an offender is convicted of an offence, and if the court by or before which he is convicted is satisfied that having regard to the circumstances, including the nature of the offence and the character of the offender, it is expedient to do so, the court may make a mandatory treatment order requiring the offender to undergo psychiatric treatment for a period not exceeding 36 months. … [Emphases added.] 94 Hence, s 337(1)(e) of the CPC 2018 precludes a sentencing court from imposing an MTO on an accused person who had previously served a term of corrective training or preventive detention. 95 Although s 337(2)(a) of the CPC 2018 provides an exception to the general limitation on those who may be sentenced to an MTO, this only applies to those falling within the ambit of ss 337(1)(d) and (g) of the CPC 2018 (meaning, only those who had previously served stints ofimprisonmentabove three months, or had been admitted to approved institutions in respect of drug or intoxicating substance offences could still be sentenced to an MTO). Hence, an accused person in the respondent’s position would, by s 337(1)(e) of the CPC 2018 (meaning those who had served a term of preventive detention), remain ineligible for an MTO. 96 Given the statutory constraints, it was not necessary for me to enquire into whether an MTO would have been an appropriate sentencing option with regard to the respondent. However, I observe that one possibly unforeseen outcome of the current MTO regime is that it would preclude accused persons who had previously been sentenced to terms of corrective training or preventive detention for offences connected to a previously undiagnosed psychiatric condition. For example, an accused person suffering from kleptomania might have been previously sentenced to a term of corrective training for repeated thefts. However, his condition might only have been diagnosed subsequently. If such an accused person were to re-offend, he would not be able to benefit from an MTO even if this were thought to be the most suitable sentencing option. 97 The MTO regime would also be unavailable to individuals who had previously served terms of corrective training or preventive detention and after their stints of incarceration become afflicted with a psychiatric condition. For example, an accused person might recently have been diagnosed with depression which was causally connected to a fresh and relatively minor misdemeanour. Such an accused person would similarly be precluded from being sentenced to an MTO. Whether the persons referred to in this and the previous paragraph should be able to benefit from the MTO regime is something that Parliament might consider. The inapplicability of probation and other options 98 The respondent was not precluded from a second stint of probation. However, I agreed with the assessment of the District Judge that that, too, was not a suitable option. As the District Judge noted, the respondent had previously been sentenced to probation in 2011, but had breached his probation order twice, ultimately leading to a term of imprisonment being imposed in 2013. As I had noted inPublic Prosecutor v Koh Wen Jie Boaz[2016] 1 SLR 334  at [55], re-offending while on probation is a relevant factor in determining whether a second order of probation would be appropriate. 99 In any event, despite the mitigating factors and the presence of certain protective factors in the respondent’s life (such as his partner and the fact that he had re-secured employment), it was not clear that another stint of probation would be effective in helping the respondent to curb his offending behaviour in relation to his fetishistic disorder. In my judgment, the District Judge was correct to have preferred a custodial term over another order of probation. Conclusion 100 In all the circumstances, I was satisfied that the District Judge had taken into account all the relevant factors in reaching his sentencing decision and had appropriately balanced the competing principles at play. Accordingly, there was no basis for interfering with the sentences imposed and I dismissed the Prosecution’s appeal.
