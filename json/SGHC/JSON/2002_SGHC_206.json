        "The provisions in question": "19.\n\n        Section 47(1) and (2) of the Banking Act\n\nprovide that(1) Customer information shall\n\n    not, in any way, be disclosed by a bank in Singapore or any of its officers to any other\n\n    person except as expressly provided in this Act.(2) A bank in Singapore or any of\n\n    its officers may, for such purpose as may be specified in the first column of the Sixth\n\n    Schedule, disclose customer information to such persons or class of persons as may be\n\n    specified in the second column of that Schedule, and in compliance with such conditions as\n\n    may be specified in the third column of that Schedule.20.\n\n        The Schedule provided that disclosure can be\n\nmade when \"[It] is necessary for compliance with an order of the Supreme Court or a\n\nJudge thereof pursuant to the powers conferred under Part IV of the Evidence Act (Cap.\n\n97).\"321.\n\n        Section 175(1) of the Evidence Act (which is in\n\nPart IV) provides thatOn the application of any party\n\n    to a legal proceeding, the court or a Judge may order that such party be at liberty to\n\n    inspect and take copies of any entries in a banker’s book for any of the purposes of\n\n    such proceedings.and \"bankers’\n\nbook\" is defined in s 170 –\"Bankers’ books\"\n\n    includes ledgers, day books, cash books, account books and all other books used in the\n\n    ordinary business of the bank.",
        "The plaintiff’s objections": "22.\n\n        The plaintiff opposed the defendant’s\n\napplication. The grounds of opposition were(1) The application is not in\n\n    compliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act.(2) The application is made in\n\n    bad faith and is a fishing expedition for evidence to bolster the defence.(3) The application is made for\n\n    the collateral and improper purpose of seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 47.(4) The documents are not\n\n    necessary under O.24 r 7 of the Rules of Court.(5) The documents are not\n\n    bankers’ books.",
        "The defendant’s submissions": "23.\n\n        Mr Hri Kumar counsel for the defendant stated\n\nthat the documents sought under this application were the same documents in the Assistant\n\nRegistrar’s order of 15 Feb which I affirmed on 27 Feb.24.\n\n        He submitted that the issue of the relevance of\n\nthe documents had been dealt with then, and the only issue left to be dealt with is\n\nwhether the court has the power to order the banks to give discovery of the documents. He\n\nargued that the court has the power because s 47 allows banks to comply with orders issued\n\nunder s 175. He contended further that the documents referred to were bankers’ books\n\nunder s 175.",
        "The application is not in\n\ncompliance with Part IV of the Evidence Act": "25.\n\n        The plaintiff submitted thatIt is plain as night follows day\n\n    that the Writs of Subpoena referred to in the Schedule in SIC 1595 are not \"court\n\n    orders\" made pursuant to said s.174. In short, the Writs of Subpoena are of no legal\n\n    effect whatsoever as they do not come within purview of the legal requirements as\n\n    aforesaid and therefore the present SIC 1595 must failin limine.426.\n\n        The schedule in summons-in-chambers No. 1595 of\n\n2002 does not refer to any writs of subpoena.27.\n\n        The defendant had caused the subpoenas to be\n\nissued before making the present application. It then filed the application when it\n\nrealised that an order under s 175 may be necessary before a bank can comply with the\n\nsubpoenas.28.\n\n        The plaintiff has misunderstood the\n\napplication. The defendant was not proceeding on the basis that a subpoena is a court\n\norder. It was seeking a court order to ensure that a bank will not contravene with s 47 if\n\nit complied with the subpoena.",
        "The application is made in bad\n\nfaith and is a fishing expedition": "29.\n\n        The defendant had at the outset stated that it\n\nwanted to have access to the documents. It applied for and obtained an order for discovery\n\nand inspection despite the plaintiff’s objections.30.\n\n        The issue of the relevance of the documents to\n\nthe proceedings was determined in that application. The defendant then sought from the\n\nbanks the same documents that the plaintiff should have supplied. There is no basis for\n\nimpugning bad faith on the application.",
        "The application is made for the\n\ncollateral and improper purpose of seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 475": "31.\n\n        The plaintiff submitted that(T)he Plaintiff has categorically\n\n    stated in his Affidavit that his \"bank accounts are not relevant to the issue of\n\n    ‘swap points’ in a forward foreign exchange contract\".In the circumstances, it is\n\n    evident that the present application is also a reckless attempt by the Defendants to\n\n    \"get behind the affidavit\" of the Plaintiff and so eschew one of the essential\n\n    safeguards provided under Part IV section 175 of the Evidence Act.632.\n\n        The defendant does not have to accept the\n\nplaintiff’s averment on the bank accounts. It is entitled to apply to court to have\n\ndiscovery of them.33.\n\n        The plaintiff’s complaint that the\n\ndefendant was seeking the court’s sanction to violate s 47 has no substance shorn of\n\nthe emotional hyperbole. A court will not sanction any violation of the law. Section 47 is\n\nnot violated when an order of court under s 175 is obtained. A court will not make an\n\norder without careful consideration, but there is no violation of s 47 when an order is\n\nmade. The plaintiff, on the other hand asserts that he has lost possession of the\n\ndocuments for which he was ordered to give discovery, but he would not obtain them from\n\nthe banks himself, and seeks to prevent the defendant from getting them from the banks\n\ndirectly.",
        "The documents are not necessary\n\nwithin Order 24 r 7 of the Rules of Court": "34.\n\n        This was an issue in the application for\n\ndiscovery and inspection. It was argued before the Assistant Registrar and on appeal,\n\nbefore me. There being no further appeal, it has been determined conclusively that those\n\ndocuments are relevant to the action.",
        "The documents in the application\n\nare not bankers’ books": "35.\n\n        The plaintiff submitted thatThe facts as presented … by\n\n    the bank’s senior legal officer, casts the drag net far and wide to include letters\n\n    from the Plaintiff to the Bank and vice versa including contracts of all shapes and form\n\n    so to speak. The expression ‘bankers’ books’ has to be interpreted\n\n    \"ejusdem generis\" with the other documents listed. It is, therefore, submitted\n\n    that, correspondence, confirmation notes, confirmation advice and facility letters cannot\n\n    be considered as being of the same genre asledgers, day books, cash books and account\n\n    books. The documents required by the Defendant are not book entries in the ordinary\n\n    meaning intended by the Act and, consequently, they are as different as a mouthful of\n\n    chalk and cheese.736.\n\n        The plaintiff referred toWilliams v\n\nWilliams[1988] 1 QB 161 which dealt with an application to inspect unsorted cheques\n\nand paying-in slips in the possession of a bank. He quoted Sir John Donaldson M.R.’s\n\njudgment where he stated at page 168I am quite unable to accept that\n\n    adding an individual cheque or paying-in slip can be regarded as making an\n\n    \"entry\" in those records. Putting the matter in another way, \"other\n\n    records\" in the new definition has, I think, to be construed ejusdem generis with\n\n    \"ledgers, day books, cash books and account books\" and unsorted bundles of\n\n    cheques and paying-in slips are not \"other records\" within the meaning of the\n\n    Act.Relying on this, he submitted\n\nthat \"if cheques and paying-in slips do not come within the meaning of\n\n‘bankers’ books’, thena fortiori, neither do correspondence,\n\nconfirmation notes, confirmation advice and facility letters.\"837.\n\n        The plaintiff would have understood the judge\n\nbetter by reading the paragraph in its entirety -In this situation Mr Ryder,\n\n    appearing for the applicant, has to submit, and does submit, that the bundles of cheques\n\n    and paying-in slips constitute bankers’ books within the modern definition and that\n\n    addition each cheque or paying-in slip to the bundle constitutes making an entry in those\n\n    books. Whilst I would be prepared to accept that the cheques constitute part of the\n\n    bank’s records used in the ordinary business of the bank (Reg. v. Jones (Benjamin)\n\n    [1978] 1 W.L.R. 195, a case concerned with a bill of lading put in evidence under the\n\n    Criminal Evidence Act 1965), I am quite unable to accept that adding an individual cheque\n\n    or paying-in slip can be regarded as making an \"entry\" in those records. Putting\n\n    the matter in another way, \"other records\" in the new definition has, I think,\n\n    to be construed ejusdem generis with \"ledgers, day books, cash books and account\n\n    books\" and unsorted bundles of cheques and paying-in slips are not \"other\n\n    records\" within the meaning of the Act.38.\n\n        The judge made a distinction between unsorted\n\ncheques and paying-in slips, which he did not regard as entries in bankers’ books,\n\nand sorted cheques which he was prepared to accept as part of a bank’s records.39.\n\n        In the same light the documents referred to in\n\nthe application are not unsorted documents. Correspondence, confirmation notes,\n\nconfirmation advice and facility letters are documents a bank would file and keep in the\n\ncourse of its ordinary business. It is necessary for a bank to maintain such records, and\n\nto refer to from time to time, for example, to ensure that facilities are not exceeded or\n\nthat instructions are carried out. Such records are bankers’ books even if they are\n\nnot in use every day, so long as they are referred to when necessary – seeThe\n\nAsylum for Idiots v Handysides(1906) 22 TLR 573. None of the banks served with the\n\napplication have stated that they do not keep such records. In any event it is open to the\n\nbanks to object or seek clarification on any document if any dispute or uncertainty should\n\narise whether it forms part of a banker’s book.40.\n\n        Having examined the plaintiff’s objections\n\nand finding no merits in them, I granted the defendant’s application.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudge1Para 36, Re-amended\n\nDefence2Notes of\n\nEvidence pages 380, 500, 544, 5983Sixth Schedule, Part\n\n1, item 74Plaintiff's Written\n\nSubmissions para 35Plaintiff's\n\nWritten Submissions, para 76Plaintiff's\n\nWritten Submissions, paras 35-67Plaintiff's Written\n\nSubmissions, para 468Plaintiff's\n\nWritten Submissions para 47Copyright © Government of Singapore."
