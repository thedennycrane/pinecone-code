        "Introduction": "1       There\nare two appeals and two applications before the court. The two appeals\nare against the decision of the learned Assistant Registrar Paul Chan\n(“the AR”) concerning the defendant’s commencement of third party proceedings.\nThe proceedings arise out of two separate but related actions brought\nby Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“AT”). The first, Suit No 477 of 2012\n(“S 477/2012”), is brought by AT against Linda Kao Chai-Chau (“Linda”),\nwho was formerly the managing director of AT from 1996 up to 2012.\nSuit 477/2012 is a derivative action brought by Carolyn Fong (“Carolyn”),\na shareholder of AT. The second, Suit No 1015 of 2012 (“S 1015/2012”),\nis brought by the Receivers and Managers (“RMs”) of AT. Suit 1015/2012\nis brought against Linda and 15 other individuals (including corporate\nindividuals). 2       The\nkey legal issue in this case is whether illegality precludes a claim for\nindemnity or contribution against a joint tortfeasor. Addressing\nthis issue requires a proper understanding of the development of\nthe law pertaining to joint tortfeasorship and the applicability\nof case authorities which I will discuss in some detail in this\njudgment. 3       After\nhearing the parties, I am allowing the appeals for the commencement\nof third party proceedings. Consequently, the two applications to\namend the third party notices are also allowed.",
        "The Facts": "4       Linda\nwas appointed as managing director of AT some time in 1996 by its\nmajority shareholder and then Chairman, Peter Fong (“PF”). PF passed\naway on 25 April 2008. Suit 477/2012 is a claim against Linda for breach\nof fiduciary duty in respect of certain transactions which mostly took\nplace whilst PF was still alive and Chairman of AT. After PF’s death, Carolyn\nobtained leave to institute a derivative action on behalf of AT against\nLinda in respect of these alleged breaches. In granting leave under section\n216A of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“CA”), the High Court\nin Originating Summons No 505 of 2010, found that PF was the controlling\nmind and will of AT at the material times (seeFong\nWai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another[2011]\n3 SLR 980). The decision of the High Court to grant leave was subsequently\naffirmed by the Court of Appeal. The essence of the defence raised\nby Linda in S 477/2012 was that the transactions complained of were\ncarried out in accordance with the instructions of PF. 5       After\nS 477/2012 was commenced, Ernst & Young was appointed RMs of\nAT on 17 January 2012. The appointment was made pursuant to an application\nby Carolyn. A consent order was subsequently granted pursuant to\nan apparent agreement between Carolyn and Linda. After their appointment,\nthe RMs took the view that there was evidence of other diversions\nmade by Linda and others to the detriment of AT. These largely concern\ntransactions or events occurring after the death of PF. For this reason,\nthe RMs commenced S 1015/2012, where it was alleged that Linda and\n15 others had been in a conspiracy to divert business away from\nAT. A claim was also brought for breach of fiduciary duty. Linda\nwas, therefore, the defendant in both S 477/2012 and S 1015/2012. 6       Themodus operandiof the alleged breaches\nin the two Suits is similar, the main difference being that they\nconcern different transactions. Those complained of by the RMs are\nmainly concerned with events occurringafterthe\ndeath of PF. The defence raised by Linda in both actions is similar –\nthat she had been authorised to act as she did by PF. Different\nlaw firms have been engaged to represent AT in the two Suits. 7       Given\nthe multiple actions, I set down certain terms of reference for ease\nof understanding. Suit 477/2012 will be referred to as “the Derivative Action”\nwhile Suit 1015/2012 will be referred to as “the RM Action”. I refer to\nboth suits collectively as “the two Suits”. For the sake of clarity,\nthe plaintiff in S 477/2012 will be referred to as “AT (Carolyn)”,\nwhile the plaintiff in S 1015/2012 will be referred to as “AT (RM)”.\nWhen needed, I refer to both plaintiffs collectively as “the Plaintiffs”.\nThe position taken by AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) in respect of the\ndefence raised by Linda whilst similar is not identical, as will\nappear below.",
        "Procedural History": "8       In\nthe Derivative Action, Linda applied by way of Summons No 2990 of\n2013 (“SUM 2990/2013”) for leave to serve a third party notice against the\nEstate of PF for an indemnity (although there is also a further application\nto amend the notice to include a claim for contribution, as will be\nelaborated below). AT (Carolyn) objected to the application. 9       In\nthe RM Action, Linda commenced third party proceedings against the\nEstate of PF on 19 April 2013. On 12 June 2013, the RMs applied\nby way of Summons No 2989 of 2013 (“SUM 2989/2013”) to set aside\nthe third party proceedings. 10     The\nAR on 19 July 2013 found for AT (RM) and granted SUM 2989/2013 to\nset aside the third party notice. Naturally, he also refused to\ngrant Linda leave to commence third party proceedings in the claim\nbrought by AT (Carolyn), thereby dismissing SUM 2990/2013. 11     Registrar’s\nAppeal No 247 of 2013 (“RA 247/2013”) is the appeal by Linda in\nthe RM Action against the decision of the AR setting aside the third\nparty notice (I refer to this third party notice as “the Notice\n(RM)”). Registrar’s Appeal No 246 of 2013 (“RA 246/2013”) is the\nappeal by Linda in the Derivative Action against the AR’s decision\nnot to grant leave to commence third party proceedings against the\nEstate of PF (I refer to this third party notice as “the Notice\n(DA)”). The subject matter of the two appeals is largely similar\nin nature – the setting aside or the granting of leave to commence\nthird party proceedings. As mentioned above, there are also two\napplications to amend the third party notices – Summons No 4420 of\n2013 (“SUM 4420/2013”) to amend the Notice (RM) (which has already been\nserved), and Summons No 4419 of 2013 (“SUM 4419/2013”) to amend the\nNotice (DA) (which has yet to be served). Both amendments relate\nto the addition of a claim in contribution (apart from the existing\nclaim in indemnity). 12     The\ntwo appeals (and applications) were heard before me on 2 September\n2013 and 11 October 2013. At the hearing on 2 September 2013, the\nmatters were adjourned for the parties to prepare further submissions on\nthe following question: Assuming that the Chairman/Director is\nthe controlling mind, directing will andalter\negoof the Company, does it follow as a matter of law\nthat any other director who blindly follows the instructions of\nthealter egodirector will not be\nin breach of her fiduciary duty or have any liability in law? I heard further submissions from counsel on 11 October 2013. 13     The\nEstate of PF, which has its own legal representation, has not taken any\npart in either Suit. They have not applied to set aside the third\nparty notices or objected to the commencement of third party proceedings.\nFor the sake of clarity, after these appeals were heard, AT (Carolyn)\napplied for leave to hand over conduct of the Derivative Action\nto the RMs. The RMs took a neutral position in this application,\nand the matter came before me on 4 November 2013. At the conclusion\nof that hearing, judgment was reserved.",
        "The decision below and Linda’s\nclaim against the third party": "14     Linda’s\ndefence in the two Suits was based on her assertion that all the transactions\ncomplained of were in fact carried out pursuant to the oral instructions\nand/or “understanding” of PF. On this basis, Linda applied for leave\nto serve a third party notice against the Estate of PF seeking an indemnity.\nIn the case of the RM action, Linda actually commenced third party\nproceedings against the Estate of PF in which she also sought an indemnity.\nAs mentioned above, in both actions, Linda also seeks a claim in contribution\nfrom the Estate of PF pursuant to her applications to amend the\nthird party notices. These amendments were not before the AR in\nthe hearing below. 15     At\nthe hearing on 19 July 2013, the AR (delivering oral judgment), found\nfor AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) on the ground that: … it is, in my view, impossible for [Linda]\nto claim an indemnity or a contribution from [PF] as a matter of\nlaw. An indemnity or contribution will only arise if the court finds\nthat [Linda] breached her fiduciary duties to AT. If she has so\nbreached her fiduciary duties, it must also mean that the requisite\nknowledge to find liability must be imputed to her. This knowledge would\nby itself preclude [Linda] from claiming an indemnity or contribution under\nthe law of agency. 16     The\ncentral point in Linda’s case is that all the “business opportunities”\nthat she was alleged to have diverted were not in fact business\nopportunities for AT. In each case, it is claimed that Linda, acting on\nthe instructions of PF, had received and disbursed funds “on behalf\nof [PF’s] friends and associates as a favour to them”. In relation\nto the transactions which were not made on the specific instructions\nof PF, Linda’s case is that they were made pursuant to the same\n“standing instructions of or understanding of” PF, who was then\nthe controlling mind and will of AT when the instructions were given\nor when the understanding came about. 17     On\nthis basis, Linda’s primary defence to the two Suits is that there was\nno breach of fiduciary or director’s duties owed by her as managing director\nto AT. The alleged business opportunities were not the business opportunities\nof AT and there could not have been a breach or conspiracy given\nthat she was merely following the instructions of PF, who was then the\nmajority shareholder, Chairman and controlling mind and will of\nAT. 18     Linda’s\nconcern, however, was that the court might after the trial find that\nshe was still liable for breach of her director’s and fiduciary\nduties even though she had believed that she was acting pursuant\nto the instructions (standing or otherwise) or understanding of\nPF. To put the argument at its most basic, there was a possibility\nthat the court might find (as a matter of law) that Linda’s duties\nas a managing director were owed to AT, notwithstanding that PF\nwas the majority shareholder and Chairman of AT. The trial court\nmight not necessarily agree that this was a case where PF should\nbe regarded as thealter egoor\ndirecting mind of AT such that his instructions were effectively\nthe instructions of AT. Alternatively, even if it is accepted that\nPF was thealter egoof AT, it did\nnot necessarily follow that this would be sufficient to absolve\nLinda of her liability for breach of her director’s and fiduciary\nduties. That being so, the argument was that Linda had a good basis\nfor commencing third party proceedings against the Estate of PF\nfor an indemnity or contribution in the event that she was found liable\nnotwithstanding the fact that she was found to have acted on the instructions\nof PF.",
        "The issues before this court": "19     The\nprocedure regarding the issuing of third party notices is found\nin O 16 r 1(1) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)\n(“ROC”), which provides that: Third party\nnotice (O. 16, r. 1) (1)    Where in any action a defendant – (a)    claims\nagainst a person not already a party to the action any contribution\nor indemnity; (b)    claims against such a person any relief\nor remedy relating to or connected with the original subject-matter\nof the action and substantially the same as some relief or remedy\nclaimed by the plaintiff; or (c)    requires that any question or issue\nrelating to or connected with the original subject-matter of the\naction should be determined not only as between the plaintiff and\nthe defendant but also as between either or both of them and a person\nnot already a party to the action, then, subject to paragraph (2), the defendant\nmay, after having entered an appearance if required to do so under\nthese Rules, issue a notice in Form 16 or 17, whichever is appropriate\n(referred to in this Order as a third party notice), containing\na statement of the nature of the claim made against him and, as\nthe case may be, either of the nature and grounds of the claim made by\nhim or of the question or issue required to be determined. 20     Where\nthird party proceedings have been commenced, the court possesses\nthe power to terminate the third party proceedings either upon a third\nparty’s application for directions under O 16 r 4(3) or at any time under\nO 16 r 6. 21     In\nthe present case, it will be recalled that the Estate of PF (the intended\nthird party) has not applied to terminate the third party proceedings\nor to object to the application for leave. The objection instead is\nsolely from the Plaintiffs. As explained inSingapore\nCivil Procedure 2013(G P Selvam gen ed) (Sweet &\nMaxwell Asia, 2013) (“Selvam on Singapore Civil\nProcedure”) at para 16/4/4, if either the plaintiff or\nthe third party decides to object, evidence is to be adduced by\nway of affidavit to support the grounds of the objection. In this\ncontext, it is also stated at para 16/4/5 that: … care should be taken that the plaintiff\nis not unduly embarrassed or put to additional expense, delay or\ndifficulty, for he has nothing to do with the questions which have\narisen between the defendant and the third party. 22     On\nthis basis, Linda submits that whilst the Plaintiffs are entitled\nto object, this can only be on the basis that the third party proceedings\nwill embarrass or delay AT or are too complicated to be properly\ntried within the original action or may result in the action being\nunduly delayed.[note: 1] 23     The\ncentral argument of AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) is that the third party\nproceedings are unnecessary since the claim against the third party replicates\nthe core of the defence pleaded in the two Suits. To put the matter another\nway, if Linda’s claim against the third party is valid, she will\nnot in any event be liable to the Plaintiff for breach of fiduciary\nand director’s duties, or even conspiracy. 24     In\nthe present appeals, the key question is whether Linda has a basis for\nseeking an indemnity or contribution against the Estate of PF, which can\nsurvive a finding of liability against her in the main actions.\nThis question can, for convenience, be broken into a number of (overlapping) subsidiary\nquestions as follows: (a)     First,\nis it good law that no indemnity or contribution can be claimed\nas a matter of law where the relevant acts were known to involve\nillegalities? (“Issue 1”) (b)     Second,\nwhat is the basis of a claim for contribution or indemnity? (“Issue\n2”) (c)     Third,\nirrespective of the above two questions, are the third party proceedings\nfor indemnity or contribution in any event redundant on the basis\nof an overlap with the pleaded defence in the main actions? (“Issue\n3”) 25     These\nquestions will now be examined with questions 1 and 2 being addressed\ntogether. For convenience, the position of AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM)\nwill be discussed together in respect of each issue, followed by\nLinda’s position, before proceeding to the next question. It goes\nwithout saying that in discussing the issues raised and the affidavits\nthat have been tendered, the court acts on the assumption that the\nclaimed facts are established.",
        "Issues 1 and 2 – the basis of\nthe claim for indemnity or contribution and whether illegality precludes\nany claim for indemnity or contribution": "26     The\nillegality relied upon in the present case is both civil and criminal in\nnature: conspiracy, breach of fiduciary duty, breach of director’s\nduty and offences under the CA. 27     In\nthe case of the Derivative Action, the claim was brought in respect of\nfour business opportunities said to have been wrongfully diverted\nby Linda. The claim for contribution/indemnity was made in relation\nto only three of these business opportunities. The position taken\nby AT (Carolyn) in respect of the pleaded defence and the third\nparty claim can be summarised as follows: (a)     AT\n(Carolyn) does not deny that PF was thealter\negoof AT.[note: 2] (b)     That\nsaid, whilst PF had at the very least “ostensible authority” to\ngive instructions on behalf of AT, the fact is that PF did not know of\nthe transactions in question and/or that the transactions were unauthorised.[note: 3] (c)     It\nfollows that the defence would fail and the claim against the Estate\nof PF was redundant. (d)     The\nargument was also raised before the AR that an indemnity could not,\nin any case, be claimed in respect of an illegal act:vizan offence under s 157 of the CA. 28     On\nthe question of illegality, AT (Carolyn) submitted that the claim against\nthe Estate of PF was solely based on agency and not joint tortfeasorship.\nIn the original application for leave to commence third party proceedings\n(before the AR), the Notice (DA) was limited to an indemnity and\nthere was no assertion that PF himself had committed any wrongdoing. The\nclaim for indemnity was said to have been based solely on the premise that\nPF had told Linda to act as she did and, therefore, was under an obligation\nto indemnify her for the consequences. Even if PF did in fact instruct\nLinda to act as she did, she would still, as a matter of law, be\nbarred from claiming indemnity on the basis of the public policy\nencapsulated in the legal maximex turpicausa non orituractio. 29     In\nsupport of the AR’s decision to reject the claim for indemnity as\na matter of law, AT (Carolyn) cited the old common law authority\nofBurrows v Rhodes and Jameson[1899]\n1 QB 816 (“Burrows”). In that case,\nKennedy J held at 828 that it has: … long been settled law that if any act\nis manifestly unlawful, or the doer of it knows it to be unlawful,\nas constituting either a civil wrong or a criminal offence, he cannot\nmaintain an action for contribution or for indemnity against the\nliability which results to him therefrom. An express promise of indemnity\nto him for the commission of such an act is void. 30     Thus,\nit was argued, even if PF had instructed Linda to act as she did and\neven if there was an implied promise to indemnify Linda for the consequences,\nshe was still not entitled, as a matter of law, to the claim for contribution\nor indemnity against the Estate of PF. 31     In\nthe RM action, AT (RM) advanced similar arguments and they pointed\nout that a breach of director’s duty is also a criminal offence\nunder s 157 of the CA, punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000\nor to imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months. Other possible\noffences referred to were dishonest misappropriation of property\nand criminal breach of trust under the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008\nRev Ed). Given the serious nature of these offences, AT (RM) submitted\nthat the rule inBurrowsshould\nbe applied. AT (RM) further asserted that even if Linda could show\nthat she did not know the acts were unlawful, that would not assist\nher case as it was sufficient, if in the capacity of an agent, she\nhad knowledge of the facts and circumstances. 32     As\nmentioned above, in relation to the Derivative Action, there was no\nclaim for contribution before the AR. Subsequently on 26 August\n2013, an application was made to amend the Notice (DA) so as to\nstate that PF, as a director of AT, had owed the same fiduciary\nduties as Linda, and to add an alternative claim for contribution.\nThere was no pleading that Linda had been misled by PF and that\nshe might not have known that her conduct was unlawful. 33     The\nresponse of Linda to the above arguments is that the right to contribution\nrelied on was not derived from the common law but from statute.\nSection 15(1) of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“CLA”) provides\nthat: Entitlement\nto contribution 15.—(1) Subject to subsections (2) to (5), any person liable\nin respect of any damage suffered by another person may recover\ncontribution from any other person liable in respect of the same\ndamage (whether jointly with him or otherwise). 34     Section\n19(2) of the CLA also provides that a person is liable in respect\nof any damage if the person who suffered the damage is entitled\nto recover compensation from him in respect of that damage (whatever\nthe legal basis of this liability) whether for tort, breach of contract,\nbreach of trust or otherwise. Section 16(2) also states that the\ntrial judge possesses the discretion to determine whether to exempt\nany person from contribution or to direct that the contribution\namounts to a complete indemnity. 35     The\nquestion as to whether a claim for contribution (which can, in the trial\njudge’s discretion, amount to an indemnity) under s 15 of the CLA\nis caught by the rule referred to inBurrowshas\nbeen considered in a number of Singapore and English decisions.\nIt is to be noted that ss 15(1), 16(2), 19(2) and 19(6) areinpara materiawith\nss 1(1), 6(1), 7(3) and 2(2) of the Civil Liability (Contribution)\nAct 1978 (c 47) (UK) (“the UK Act”). 36     InK and Another v P and Another[1993] Ch\n140 (“K v P”), the plaintiffs brought\nan action for damages against the defendants for conspiracy to defraud.\nThe third defendant issued a third party notice against the accountant\nof the plaintiff for contribution or indemnity on the basis that\nthe accountant had been negligent in failing to warn the Plaintiff of\nthe risks involved in the defendants’ transactions. The claim for contribution\nwas based on s 1(1) of the UK Act. 37     The\nUK Act had replaced s 6 of the Law Reform (Married Women and Tortfeasors)\nAct 1935 (c 30) (UK) (“the LRA 1935”). The latter had created a\nright of contribution between joint tortfeasors that was available “where\ndamage is suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether\na crime or not).” On this basis, Ferris J held that theex turpicausadefence was\nnot available as an answer to a claim for contribution under the\nUK Act. He held at p 149 that: … The specific purpose of that Act, as\nof the Act of 1935 before it, was to enable claims for contribution\nto be made as between parties who had no claim to contribution under\nthe general law. To permit the ex turpi causa defence to be relied\nupon as an answer to such a claim would, in my view, narrow to a\nsubstantial extent the deliberately wide wording of section 6(1)\nof the Act of 1978 and would, in effect, make a claim for contribution\nsubject to a condition precedent which is not to be found in the\nAct. Moreover, section 2(1) and (2) give the court ample power to\nfix the amount of the contribution at a level, including a zero\nlevel, which takes account of all the factors which, in relation\nto common law claims, are relevant to the ex turpi causa defence. 38     In\nSingapore, a similar approach was taken by Judith Prakash J inNganthaveeTeriya\n(alias Gan Hui Poo) v Ang Yee Lim Lawrence and others[2003]\n2 SLR(R) 361 (“Nganthavee”). In\nthat case, a claim was brought by the plaintiff and BC Tan (her\nhusband) in separate proceedings against the directors of two Singapore\ncompanies for misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary\nduty and conspiracy. Third party proceedings were commenced against\nBC Tan for an indemnity or contribution. The third party proceedings\nwere objected to on a number of grounds, including the argument\nof illegality. The claim for contribution was based on (the then\napplicable) s 11 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLA\n1994”), which is similar to s 6 of the LRA 1935. Section 11 provides for\na right of contribution between joint and several tortfeasors whenever damage\nis suffered by any person as a result of a tort (whether a crime\nor not). Prakash J accordingly held (at [17]) that the third party\nclaim against BC Tan was not precluded on the basis that BC Tan,\nif liable, was liable as a party to the conspiracy. Even if the\ntort was a crime, s 11 permitted a claim for contribution. That\nsaid, the learned judge also exercised the power set out in s 11(2)\nto exempt BC Tan from making contributions, as otherwise the defendants\nwould be able to retain part of the wrongfully acquired benefit. 39     The\ndecision of Prakash J did not concern ss 15 and 16 of the CLA. These\nprovisions amended and replaced s 11 of the CLA 1994 but were not applicable\nsince the new provisions only applied to events occurring after\n1 January 1999. The learned judge was aware of the new provisions\nbut did not make any specific comment on them. That said, Prakash\nJ discussed at length the case ofK v Pin\narriving at her decision. In the circumstances, I have no doubt\nthat the position in Singapore today is the same as that expressed\ninK v P– a claim for contribution\nunder ss 15 and 16 of the CLA isnot affectedby\nany illegality (tortious or criminal) tainting the transactions\nor events. A right to seek contribution is provided for in all cases\nagainst a person who is liable in respect of the same damage – whether that\nliability is joint or otherwise. Neither does it matter whether\nthe basis of that liability for the same damage is in tort, breach\nof contract, breach of trust or otherwise. 40     In\nreaching this decision, I am reinforced in my view by the fact that in\nthe Parliamentary debates on the amendments to the CLA 1994, the Minister\nof State for Law (Associate Professor Ho Peng Kee) observed that the\namendments were intended to bring Singapore’s law on contribution\nin line with the UK Act and to address anomalies in litigation practice.\nSeeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official\nReport(26 November 1998), vol 69 at cols 1694–1698 (Associate\nProfessor Ho Peng Kee, Minister of State for Law).",
        "Issue 3 – Whether the third\nparty proceedings are in any case irrelevant or redundant": "41     AT\n(Carolyn) also took the point that quite apart from the question\nof illegality, the third party proceedings were in any event redundant\nas they were nothing more than a reproduction of the position taken\nin the defence. Cases cited in support includedYemen\nSalt Mining Corp v Rhodes-Vaughan Steel Ltd(1976) Carswell\nBC 141 (“Yemen”) andWestcoast Transmission Co v Interprovincial Steel\n& Pipe Corp(1985) Carswell BC 48 (“Westcoast”). 42Yemenconcerned a suit brought by Y against\nS for negligence in the manufacture of a pipe delivered within Ontario.\nThe pipe had been transported under the supervision of SW, who was\nY’s agent. SW had also inspected and tested the pipe. S sought to\nbring third party proceedings against SW for an indemnity or contribution.\nSW was said to be liable to contribute on the basis that it had\nbeen negligent during the transportation and testing process. At\nthe third party directions stage, the proceedings were set aside\non the ground that the basis of the claim against the third party\nwas the same as the defence raised in the main action. 43     The\ncase ofWestcoastinvolved similar\nfacts, where a claim was made against the manufacturer for damages\narising out of a failed pipe. The third party, H, had been retained\nto inspect the pipe during the manufacturing process. The plaintiff\ninitially sued both the defendant and H for breach of contract and\nnegligence. Subsequently, the claim by the plaintiff against the third\nparty was settled. At this stage, the defendant instituted third\nparty proceedings against H for contribution. There was no contract\nbetween the defendant and the plaintiff. In striking out the third\nparty proceedings, the court, citingYemen,\ncommented that if H had been acting as an agent of the plaintiff\n(in carrying out the inspection), any fault of H would be attributable\nto the plaintiff (through the doctrine of vicarious liability) in respect\nof the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. That being so, any fault\nby H would already be attributed to the plaintiff for the purpose\nof reducing its scale of recovery against the defendant. The argument\nthat H might have acted outside the scope of his authority from\nthe plaintiff, thereby relieving the plaintiff from vicarious liability,\nwas not accepted. The point had never been pleaded. Indeed, the\ndefendant had always taken the position that H was, at all times,\nacting as an agent for the plaintiff. That being so, the third party\nclaim was in this sense redundant as the acts of the third party\nwould be attributable to the plaintiff. 44     AT\n(Carolyn), in its submissions, relied on the above Canadian High Court\ndecisions as well as the decision of Prakash J inNganthaveethat\nwas discussed earlier. It will be recalled that, in the latter case,\na claim was brought by the plaintiff and BC Tan (her husband) in\nseparate proceedings against the directors of two Singapore companies\nfor misrepresentation, breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty\nand conspiracy. Third party proceedings were commenced against BC\nTan for an indemnity or contribution on the basis that BC Tan was\na co-conspirator. Whilst Prakash J accepted that illegality was\nnot itself a bar to the claim for statutory contribution, the proceedings\nagainst BC Tan as a third party was redundant. At [24], the learned\njudge commented that: … In any case, if he had been a co-conspirator,\nsince it was admitted that [the third party] was the [plaintiff’s]\nagent, [the plaintiff] would not be able to succeed in her action\nagainst the [defendants]. Once this point was brought up as a point\nof defence and proved it would completely defeat the plaintiff’s claim\nand there could be no issue between the [defendants] and the third party.\nAs [counsel for the plaintiff] submitted, because [the third party]\nwas the plaintiff’s agent andalter egoin\nthe matters relating to Europa, there was no separate issue to be\ntried whether of indemnity or contribution or otherwise between\nthe [defendant] and the [the third party]. … 45     Reference\nhas also been made to the decision of the Court of Appeal inYong Kheng Leong and another v Panweld Trading Pte\nLtd and another[2013] 1 SLR 173 (“Panweld”)\n(where the appeal was dismissed and the decision of the High Court\nwas upheld). The plaintiff, Panweld, had brought an action against\nthe directors for breach of fiduciary duties. The claim was based\non the assertion that the first defendant (a director) had placed\nhis wife on the payroll for some 17 years when she was not in fact\nan employee of Panweld. The defendant director issued a third party\nnotice against L, another director who was also the majority shareholder\nat that point in time. The basis of the claim for contribution was\nthat L had approved the payments. Before the High Court, Steven\nChong JC held that there was no merit in the third party action.\nOn appeal, Sundaresh Menon JA (as he then was) agreed and held at\n[84] that: …the third party claim against [L] had\nabsolutely no merit. If [L] had agreed to the salary payments, then\n[the defendant director] would not be liable in the first place.\nOn the other hand, if [L] had not agreed to this, then there would\nbe no basis for seeking any indemnity or contribution from [L]. 46     On\nthe basis of these decisions, AT (Carolyn) submitted that, with reference\nto the pleadings, Linda would have to prove the same facts in order\nto succeed in her defence and her third party claim. However, in\nthe event that she succeeds in the defence, the third party claim\nwould be redundant. Meanwhile, if her defence fails, the third party\nclaim will likewise not be able to succeed. In the written submissions,\nAT (Carolyn) accepts that PF did have, at the very least, ostensible\nauthority to act on behalf of AT – that is to give instructions\nto Linda. Whether he did in fact do so was the centre piece of both\nthe defence and the third party claim. 47     In\nthe RM Action, AT (RM) took a similar stand and also submitted that\nthe third party proceedings were not necessary. AT (RM) further submitted\nthat whilst an action to strike out a third party claim is typically brought\nby the third party, there is nothing which prevents the plaintiff\nin the main action from taking that step. In support, AT (RM) relied\non O 18 r 19 of the ROC which provides that a court may, at any\nstage of the proceedings, order a pleading to be struck out on these\ngrounds: (a) no reasonable cause of action is disclosed; (b) it\nis scandalous, frivolous and/or vexatious; (c) it will prejudice,\nembarrass or delay the fair trial of the action; and (d) it is an\nabuse of process. 48     AT\n(RM) submits thatNganthaveeapplies\nsince Linda’s defence was that she did not commit any of the alleged\nbreaches because she was complying with the directions of PF who\nwas thealter ego(or controlling mind\nand will) of AT. Instructions from PF were to be treated as the instructions\nof AT. AT (RM) also asserts that if Linda’s position is that PF and\nAT are not one and the same (in order to validate the third party claim),\nLinda would be adopting contrary positions. For completeness, it\nis noted that AT (RM) has also submitted (in their closing submissions)\nthat the claim, as set out in the third party notice, was inherently\nimprobable. To this end, why would PF, as the allegedalter egoand controlling mind of AT, instruct\nLinda to commit acts against AT such that AT would lose almost its entire\nbusiness? 49     The\nquestion, therefore, is whether the third party claim by Linda against\nthe Estate of PF is redundant – in other words, is there any basis upon\nwhich Linda might fail in her defence in the main action brought\nby AT and yet, on the same facts, still have grounds to succeed\nin her claim for contribution from the Estate of PF? Linda’s defence\nto the main actions in the two Suits is that she did not commit\nany of the alleged breaches since all the impugned transactions\nwere carried out on the instructions or directions of PF. If that\ncan be established as a matter of fact, Linda submits that she will\nnot be liable for breach of duty on the basis that PF was thealter egoor controlling mind and will\nof AT. If it is assumed that the facts alleged by Linda can be established,\nthe question of law as to whether this absolves her from any claim\nby AT will have to be decided. Whilst the High Court, in granting\nleave to Carolyn to commence the Derivative Action, has held that\nPF was the controlling mind and will prior to his demise, this was said\nin the context of the leave application. Until the evidence is heard\nand the issues are properly ventilated, there is no telling whether\nthe trial judge will come to a similar conclusion on the evidence\nplaced before the court. In any case, even if PF, as the majority\nshareholder and Chairman of AT, had instructed Linda to act as she\ndid (to the apparent detriment of AT), this will not necessarily,\nas a matter of law, absolve Linda from liability vis-à-vis AT. 50     AT\n(RM) submitted, in their closing submissions, that even if PF had directed\nthe conspiracy to be perpetrated (and was in breach of his own duties\nowed to AT), Linda, as the managing director, owed an independent duty\nto AT. To merely follow the instructions of the Chairman (and majority\nshareholder) may not relieve her from that duty. 51     The\nbasis of the claim for contribution in the two Suits, as stated above,\nis founded on s 15(1) of the CLA. To succeed, it is necessary to\nshow that another person (ie, the\nthird party) is liable in respect of the “same damage”. In this\ncase, the damage would be the losses sustained by AT as a result\nof the business diversions. The claim for contribution does not\nhave to be based on joint tortfeasorship. Section 15(1) of the CLA\nmakes it clear that contribution can be sought even against another\nparty who is severally liable for the same damage. If Linda is found\nliable in the main actions, this will be on the basis that she has\nbreached her director’s and fiduciary duties in carrying out the\ntransactions. This could be because: (a)     the\ntrial judge finds that PF did not in fact know of or consent to the\ntransactions; or (b)     even\nif he did, his consent was not sufficient, as a matter of law, to\nabsolve Linda from performing her independent duties owed to AT. 52     It\nis in the latter case, that Linda appears to have some grounds for seeking\ncontribution from the Estate of PF. PF, being the Chairman and director\nof AT at that point in time, would also have owed a fiduciary duty to\nAT. Whether or not he was in breach or is absolved because he was\nthealter egoof the company is\na matter that can only be determined at trial. Even though leave\nwas granted to commence the Derivative Action against Linda, the\npossibility remains that the trial judge will find that, at the material\ntime(s), PF was not thealter ego(or\nindeed the majority shareholder). The possibility remains that the\ntrial judge will find that PF, by directing Linda to act as she\ndid, was himself in breach of his fiduciary duties. If so, this\nwill result in a situation where two persons, the managing director\nand the Chairman, are in breach of fiduciary duties such as to cause losses\nto AT. It is for such an eventuality that Linda seeks to commence third\nparty proceedings against the Estate of PF. 53     The\nfactual question remains as to whether the possibilities referred\nto above are fanciful or inherently so improbable that they should\nnot be taken into account. As far as the question as to whether\nPF was either thealter egoor controlling\nmind and will of AT is concerned, AT (Carolyn) does accept that\nPF, at least, possessed ostensible authority to direct Linda to\nact. That said, Linda has submitted that AT (Carolyn) has not in\nits pleadings admitted that PF was either thealter\negoor controlling mind of AT. On this point, it must\nbe noted, however, that the response of counsel for AT (Carolyn)\nwas that it was accepted that PF was thealter\negoand controlling will of ATup\ntill his deathand that this was the position taken before Prakash\nJ inFong Wai Lyn Carolyn v Airtrust (Singapore)\nPte Ltd and another[2011] 3 SLR 980 (the application\nfor leave to commence derivative proceedings). In the RM action,\nAT (RM) has, on the other hand, expressly denied that PF was thealter egoor controlling mind of AT. Linda,\nin her closing submissions, pointed out that PF was not the sole\nshareholder or even a major shareholder of AT since 2006. That was\nwhen it is said PF had transferred the majority of his shares to\nthe Fong Foundation charitable trust. At the date of his death,\nthe point is made that PF only held 3.6% of the shares while the\nFong Foundation held some 51%. The rest of the shares were held\nin varying amounts by 11 other persons including Carolyn who had\nowned 6.2% of the shares. It will be recalled that the RM Action\nwas largely in respect of transactions said to have taken placeafterPF’s death. That said, the transactions\nraised in the Derivative Action appear to be largely concerned with\nevents taking placebeforehis death,\nindeed before 2006. 54     If,\nat trial, the court finds that at the material times (ie, when the transactions were carried\nout), PF despite his shareholding was not to be treated as thealter egoor controlling mind of AT (such\nthat his acts can be treated as AT’s acts), it must follow that\nLinda may well be in breach of her duties even if she proves that\nshe had acted with PF’s knowledge and consent. On the other hand,\nLinda also submits that in the event PF is found to be the controlling\nmind of AT, it does not follow that, as a matter of law, PF was\nfree to do whatever he wished with AT’s assets and business. Reference\nwas made to the English case ofIn re W &\nM Roith Ltd[1967] 1 WLR 432. That was a case where R\nheld more than two-thirds of the shares and was the controlling\nspirit of the plaintiff company which he had founded. R directed\nthe company to sign a covenant to pay his wife an annual pension\nafter his death. The court found that the covenant was not madebona fidefor the benefit of the company.\nIn reaching this conclusion, Plowman J noted that there was no evidence\nof any other director explaining the reasons for the agreement. 55     In\nany case, a question also arises as to what it means to be regarded\nas the “controlling mind” or “moving spirit” or “alter\nego” of a company. Linda submitted that the key element\nis such that the person has “singular control” and who is, in substance,\ncarrying out his own business through the company. For this proposition,\nthe High Court decision ofLim Leong Huat v\nChip HupHupKee Construction Pte Ltd[2009] 2 SLR(R)\n318 (“Lim Leong Huat”) was cited.\nIn that case, Andrew Ang J, in passing, commented at [29] that even\nwhere a business is managed solely by one person, that one person\nand the company are in law, nevertheless, separate legal entities. This\nstatement was made in relation to the question of whether a combination\nbetween a director and the company could form the basis of a conspiracy.\nIssues as to whether a director/shareholder is thealter\negoor controlling mind can arise in cases where an outsider\n(such as a trade creditor) sues the company for a debt and wishes\nto lift the veil of incorporation in order to establish personal\nliability against the director/shareholder. It may also be relevant\nin the context of determining the state of mind of a company. Indeed,\nthis issue also arises in the context of whether a director may\nbe held personally liable for the torts of the company. The question\ncan also arise in cases where it is the company itself which wishes\nto bring a claim against a defaulting director. Such was the case\ninLim Leong Huatwhere an application\nwas made to join the controlling director as second defendant on\nthe basis that he was a co-conspirator with the company. Andrew\nAng J, at [22], cites (with approval)Walter\nWoon on Company Law(Tan Cheng Han gen ed) (Sweet and Maxwell,\n3rd Ed, 2005) at para 3.106, which states that: … Where the person who represents the company’s\ndirecting mind is acting in fraud of the company, his knowledge\nor intention will not be imputed to the company where the company\nis suing its officers in respect of breach of their duties. Thus,\nwhere the directors of a company conspire to defraud the company,\nthe company is not a party to the conspiracy even if the directors\nin question are its ‘brain’. 56     For\nthis reason, the learned judge concluded, and with respect, rightly so,\nat [23], that where the company is a victim of a conspiracy of its directors\nand sues the directors in respect of breach of duties, the company does\nnot become a co-conspirator with its directors merely because its directors\nare the conspirators. The position is different where the company and\nits directors were in an established arrangement which benefited\nthe company to the detriment of third parties. Here, Andrew Ang\nJ commented at [24] that the company would no longer be the victim.\nInstead, the third party is the victim of the alleged conspiracy\nbetween the company and its directors. There was, applyingBelmont Finance Corporation Ltd v Williams Furniture\nLtd and Others[1979] Ch 250, no reason why the assets\nof a limited company and/or that of its errant director, even one\nwho was the controlling mind of the company, should not be made\nliable to answer for conspiracy. English cases taking a similar\nline includeAttorney-General’s Reference (No\n2 of 1982)[1984] QB 624 which dealt with the issue of whether\na person in total control of a limited liability company (by reason of\nshareholding and directorship) is capable of stealing the property\nof the company. Given that AT (RM)’s position is that Linda, as\nthe managing director, owed an independent fiduciary duty to AT,\nLinda has submitted that the court might find that even if PF gave\nher instructions (as Chairman and major shareholder), that she could\nnot (as a matter of law) act on those instructions without breaching\nher duties. 57     AT\n(Carolyn) also relied on the principle that it was trite law that\na director can avoid liability for breach of fiduciary duty by making\na full disclosure to the company: that is to say the shareholders\nof the company. It was argued that followingPanweld,\nno actual shareholder resolution was needed – it would be sufficient\nif all shareholders did assent to the course of action. InPanweld, there were only two director\nshareholders of a company. The company brought an action against\nthe first director shareholder for placing his wife on the company’s\npay roll even though she was not an employee. The first director\nshareholder applied for a third party notice against the second\ndirector shareholder. The application was dismissed on the basis\nthat in the event the second director shareholder had agreed to\nthe payments, the first director shareholder would have obtained the\nconsent of all the shareholders. 58     In\nthe case of the Derivative Action, Linda, however, points out that PF\nand Linda collectively only held 17.2% of the shares at the date\nof PF’s death. Prior to that, in 2006, some 51% of the shares had\nbeen transferred to the Fong Foundation charitable trust. The remaining\nshares, at the date of death, were held by various family members.\nThis included Carolyn Fong who had owned 6.2% of the shares. It\nfollows that the line of cases similar toPanwelddoes\nnot provide much assistance on the facts of this case. In relation\nto the RM Action, the transactions that were complained of occurred\nlargelyafterthe death of PF, at\na point in time when PF’s shareholding had already been greatly\nreduced. With regard to the Derivative Action, whilst the relevant\ntransactions had occurred mainlybeforePF’s\ndemise (some time before 2006), it does not appear that PF and Linda\nhad owned all the shares in AT at the relevant times. The first\nclaim, for which contribution is sought, concerns alleged diversions\nof business opportunities from Chinese chemical companies. It is\nasserted that the diversions took place between 2000 to the date\nof the writ. The second claim, for which contribution is also sought,\nis in respect of diversions from another Chinese company from around\n2001. The third claim relates to acts occurring around 2002 and\n2004. It has been said that all the shareholders and directors of\nAT were, in general, content to acquiesce in PF’s management of\nAT whilst he was alive and that if a shareholders’ meeting had been\ncalled, they would “probably have voted in favour of Peter Fong’s proposals”.\nIt was also submitted that the reality of family-run companies is such\nthat the directors and shareholders are understandably content to acquiesce\nwith the founderalter ego, at least\nwhilst he is still alive and personally managing the business.[note: 4]Whilst I have sympathy for the argument,\nand whilst it is acknowledged that the alleged degree of acquiescence\nmay be proved at trial, it is not clear at this stage that this\nwillinevitablybe the position.\nEven though Linda has herself referred to PF as the controlling\nmind of AT, it does not follow that all the shareholders would have\nnecessarily agreed with all the transactions in issue. 59     I,\ntherefore, found that the third party notices were not redundant, although\nthe grounds for the third party notices shared primarily the same facts\nas Linda’s defence in the two Suits. 60     For\nthe avoidance of doubt, in arriving at the above decision, I have noted\nthe submissions made by AT (Carolyn) and AT (RM) concerning the delay\nand expense that will arise from the third party proceedings. That said,\nI am satisfied that there is a close connection between the main\naction against Linda in the two Suits and her claim for contribution\nfrom the Estate of PF. In these circumstances, I am of the view\nthat the third party proceedings should be allowed such that the\nissues can be properly ventilated in the interest of all concerned.",
        "Discretion of the trial court\nand contribution": "61     The\npoint has been mentioned above that under s 16(2) of the CLA, the\ncourt enjoys the power in any such proceedings for contribution,\nto exempt a person from liability to make contribution. For example,\nif it should transpire that the result of a successful claim for\ncontribution is such that the defendant is unjustly enriched in\nrespect of the gains, the court may very well decide that this is\nan appropriate case to exercise the discretion. Indeed, this was\na possibility that Linda recognised in her submissions. The point\nmade, however, was that this was a decision which could only be made\nby the trial court after all the facts and issues had been fully\nventilated and decided upon, including the question of any benefit\nreceived by Linda. Other factors which may have a bearing on the\nexercise of this discretion after the trial might include those\ntouching onex turpicausa. Whilst I am sympathetic to the\nargument by AT (RM) that this matter can be decided today, especially\nin light of the result inNganthaveewhere\nthe discretion was exercised, in my view, it will be fairer and\nmore appropriate for this issue to be addressed at the end of the\ntrial.",
        "The application to amend the\nthird party notice": "62     Given\nmy decision on the availability of third party proceedings in respect\nof Linda’s claim for contribution, I am also granting the applications\nto amend the third party notices.",
        "Conclusion": "63     The\nappeals (RA 246/2013 and RA 247/2013) are allowed. The applications\nby Linda to amend the relevant third party notices (SUM 4419/2013\nand SUM 4420/2013) are also allowed. I will hear parties on costs at\na later date.
