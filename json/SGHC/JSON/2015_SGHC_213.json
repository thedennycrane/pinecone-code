        "Introduction": "1       This action is brought by the\n                                        plaintiff, Sports Connection Pte Ltd (“Sports\n                                        Connection”) against its former solicitors for\n                                        professional negligence in and about the conduct of Sports\n                                        Connection’s assessment of damages in Suit No 630 of\n                                        1999 (hereinafter referred to as either “Suit\n                                        630” or “the Singapore Assessment”)\n                                        against Mr N Swami and Mr Velekatt Krishnan Sankara\n                                        Narayanan, the partners of a law firm, Messrs Swami &\n                                        Narayanan (“S&N”) in Singapore (for ease\n                                        of reference, the defendants in Suit 630 shall be referred\n                                        to as S&N). S&N was engaged by Sports Connection to\n                                        register its trademark in Malaysia in 1991, but the\n                                        partnership ended up being sued by Sports Connection for\n                                        botching that registration. 2       Sports Connection is a company\n                                        incorporated in Singapore and is a wholesaler and retailer\n                                        of sporting goods and equipment. It is also a manufacturer\n                                        of luggage bags, brief cases and the like. Mr Yee Kok Chew\n                                        (“Mr Yee”) and his wife, Ms Chang Hui Ming\n                                        (“Ms Chang”), are the directors and\n                                        shareholders of Sports Connection. Sports Connection is said\n                                        to be the registered proprietor of the “BODYPAC +\n                                        DEVICE” trademark in Singapore (“the\n                                        Trademark”). 3       Sports Connection’s\n                                        dissatisfaction with the outcome of the assessment of\n                                        damages in Suit 630 against S&N subsequently led to the\n                                        commencement of this action against three law firms on 1\n                                        September 2011, more than two years after the second\n                                        defendant, Asia Law Corporation (“ALC”),\n                                        ceased to have conduct of Suit 630. 4       The present action against the first\n                                        defendant, Netto & Magin LLC (“N&M”),\n                                        was discontinued on 13 November 2013. Sports Connection,\n                                        however, continued with this action which proceeded to trial\n                                        against ALC and the third defendant, Samuel Seow Law\n                                        Corporation (“SSLC”). ALC and SSLC are\n                                        hereafter referred to collectively as “the\n                                        defendants”. 5       It was agreed on the first day of\n                                        trial that this court would not be required to consider any\n                                        issue of apportionment of liability between ALC and SSLC as\n                                        this matter would be resolved between the firms. This was a\n                                        sensible approach since the lawyer who had conduct of Suit\n                                        630 throughout his time at ALC and SSLC was Mr A. Shahiran\n                                        Anis bin Mohamad Ibrahim (“Mr Shahiran”). Mr\n                                        Shahiran continued to have conduct of Suit 630 when he moved\n                                        between the defendant firms. 6       In this action, Sports Connection is\n                                        represented by Mr Samuel Chacko (“Mr Chacko”)\n                                        and counsel for the defendants is Mr Christopher Anand\n                                        Daniel (“Mr Daniel”).",
        "Overview of the present proceedings": "7       The case that Sports Connection\n                                        seeks to make here involves Mr Shahiran’s advice (or\n                                        lack of advice) over a range of matters connected with\n                                        Sports Connection’s assessment of damages in Suit 630.\n                                        Sports Connection’s contention is that, owing to the\n                                        defendants’ negligence, it lost the chance of\n                                        recovering substantial damages in Suit 630. The defendants\n                                        deny that their scope of duty included giving advice as\n                                        pleaded, deny breach and causation, allege a failure to\n                                        mitigate and also assert contributory negligence. To the\n                                        defendants, Sports Connection had not shown that it had\n                                        suffered loss as a result of the defendants’ alleged\n                                        failure to give relevant advice. 8       As a matter of practicality, it is\n                                        hardly straightforward to prove that a case which was lost\n                                        after a full hearing would have been won if it had been\n                                        conducted differently. Ultimately, this action will\n                                        determine whether Sports Connection’s failure to\n                                        recover substantial damages in the Suit 630 was really due\n                                        to the defendants’ professional negligence, or whether\n                                        it was a case where Sports Connection would not have\n                                        recovered substantial damages in any event. 9       Sports Connection’s complaints\n                                        which formed the basis of its case against the defendants\n                                        have been set out in broad and general terms in their\n                                        pleadings even though they were crucial matters that would\n                                        potentially fall for consideration. Sports Connection had\n                                        advanced its case in both contract and tort. Insofar as\n                                        Sports Connection argued that the same duty arose in\n                                        contract because of an implied term of the retainer and in\n                                        the tort of negligence, the analysis would be identical.\n                                        This judgment will focus on the real issues in this case\n                                        based on the basic principles of the law of\n                                        negligence. 10     Other than its averment in the\n                                        pleadings that ALC took over the conduct of the assessment\n                                        of damages in Suit 630 from N&M in August 2006, there\n                                        was no specific plea as to the precise scope and terms of\n                                        the retainer save for an implied duty of skill and care in\n                                        and about the conduct of Suit 630. Mr Daniel complained in\n                                        the defendants’ Closing Submissions dated 30 January\n                                        2015 that Sports Connection’s claim against the\n                                        defendants “has not been clearly or precisely framed\n                                        or pleaded”. Mr Chacko disagreed. He nonetheless\n                                        endeavoured to set out the thrust of Sports\n                                        Connection’s case in his Reply Submissions dated 16\n                                        February 2015. 11     I agree that if the pleadings,\n                                        evidence and arguments had been more focussed and precise,\n                                        the real issues in this case would have emerged clearer and\n                                        earlier for everyone concerned. The identification of the\n                                        real issues in this case and my conclusions on the real\n                                        issues follow from the arguments and distillation of the\n                                        pleadings, voluminous bundles of agreed documents and a fair\n                                        amount of evidence bearing to varying degrees upon the\n                                        points. 12     As with most cases of professional\n                                        negligence, the precise scope of the duty of skill and care\n                                        established in the terms of engagement of the defendants to\n                                        handle the litigation in Suit 630 is pivotal. In this\n                                        regard, an important issue here is whether the\n                                        defendants’ advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell\n                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer. With\n                                        this issue in mind, a good approach and starting point for\n                                        this particular case is to ascertain what the non-negligent\n                                        lawyer would have precisely advised in the particular\n                                        circumstances in which the allegations of breach arose in\n                                        order for this court to properly apply the relevant standard\n                                        of the reasonably competent lawyer. Accordingly, Sports\n                                        Connection has to establish the following matter: What\n                                        advice in all the circumstances of the case would a\n                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran\n                                        have given? This question will hereafter be referred to as\n                                        “the proper advice argument”. 13     An analysis of how matters stood\n                                        when the advice was supposedly given or omitted is\n                                        necessary. This analysis is significant as: (a) the\n                                        defendants cannot be liable for any error of judgment in the\n                                        course of a lawsuit, and (b) the defendants’ conduct\n                                        is not to be assessed with the benefit of hindsight. As Lord\n                                        Salmon observed inSaif Ali and another v\n                                                Sydney Mitchell & Co (a firm) and\n                                                other[1980] 1 AC 198 at 231: … Lawyers are often faced with finely balanced\n                                                problems. Diametrically opposed views may and not\n                                                infrequently are taken by barristers and indeed by\n                                                judges, each of whom has exercised reasonable, and\n                                                sometimes far more than reasonable, care and\n                                                competence. The fact that one of them turns out to\n                                                be wrong certainly does not mean that he had been\n                                                negligent. … 14     Another important issue is\n                                        causation. Was the advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded the\n                                        reason for Sports Connection’s failure to recover\n                                        substantial damages in Suit 630? In this regard, Sports\n                                        Connection has to show a causal link between the\n                                        defendants’ breach and the outcome of Suit 630. To\n                                        show the relevant causal link, Sports Connection has to\n                                        satisfy the court as to what action, if any, it would have\n                                        taken to obtain the benefit or avoid the loss if the proper\n                                        advice had been given. Put simply, the legal question that\n                                        must be answered by Sports Connection is as follows: What\n                                        action would Sports Connection, on a balance of probability,\n                                        have taken if it had received proper advice? This question\n                                        will hereafter be referred to as “the primary\n                                        causation issue”. 15     It must be remembered that the law\n                                        of causation in the context of lawyers’ negligence\n                                        makes a distinction between a case where the negligence\n                                        consists of giving advice, which is either bad or wrong, and\n                                        a case where the negligence consists of failure to advise\n                                                (ie, an omission). In\n                                        the case of an omission, causation depends on the\n                                        hypothetical question of what Sports Connection would have\n                                        done if the omission had not occurred. Although the question\n                                        is a hypothetical one, it is well-established that Sports\n                                        Connection has to prove on a balance of probability that it\n                                        would have taken action to obtain the benefit or avoid the\n                                        risk if proper advice had been given (seeAllied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons & Simmons (a\n                                                firm)[1995] 1 WLR 1602\n                                                (“Allied\n                                        Maples”) at 1610) cited inJSI Shipping (S) Pte Ltd v\n                                                Teofoongwonglcloong (a firm)[2007] 4\n                                        SLR(R) 460 (“JSI\n                                                Shipping”) at [147]).\n                                        Evidentially, this issue could be a matter of inference to\n                                        be determined from all the circumstances of the case. Where\n                                        the evidential burden has shifted to the defendants, the\n                                        inference could be rebutted by objective evidence to prove\n                                        that the omission was not causative. 16     A feature of the pleadings on the\n                                        issue of causation requires mention. Sport\n                                        Connection’s Statement of Claim averred as to what it\n                                        would have done had it received proper advice in relation to\n                                        its claim for damages against S&N. The pleadings also\n                                        asserted the “courses of action” supposedly\n                                        opened to Sports Connection, for example, to halt and defer\n                                        the Singapore Assessment pending completion of the\n                                        assessment of damages in Malaysia in respect of an\n                                        interlocutory judgment obtained in 2005 (see [30] below)\n                                        (“the Malaysian Assessment”) and to use the\n                                        amount adjudged in the Malaysian Assessment as evidence of\n                                        Sports Connection’s loss. Mr Chacko argued that a\n                                        final judgment obtained in the Malaysian Assessment would\n                                        “constitute irrefutable and/or conclusive and/or\n                                        persuasive evidence of Sports Connection’s\n                                        losses” and as such it “would have been\n                                        relevant to the Singapore Assessment and admissible as\n                                        evidence in the Singapore Assessment”. 17     This Judgment will examine whether\n                                        the evidence of Sports Connection’s principal witness,\n                                        Mr Yee, gave any indication as to what “courses of\n                                        action” as pleaded he would in fact have adopted.\n                                        Suffice to say for now that the evidence does not appear to\n                                        support Sports Connection’s pleaded case. In fact, the\n                                        state of affairs that emerged reveals that the pleaded\n                                        “courses of action” were not available and\n                                        viable as options, or if available as an option, it was not\n                                        followed through for reasons that were independent of the\n                                        defendants’ conduct (see [98]–[184]\n                                        below). 18     By focusing on the two questions\n                                        at [12] and [14] above (ie,\n                                        the proper advice argument and the primary causation issue),\n                                        and scrutinising the subsisting state of affairs at\n                                        different stages of the litigation in Suit 630, the court\n                                        would be in a position to decide if the loss which Sports\n                                        Connection says it had suffered was in fact caused by the\n                                        defendants’ alleged failure to give relevant\n                                        advice. 19     Sports Connection formulated its\n                                        claim (ie, loss that arose\n                                        from Mr Shahiran’s advice (or lack of advice)) as the\n                                        “loss of a chance” to recover more money in\n                                        Suit 630 than was in fact recovered in respect of its\n                                        various heads of claim against S&N in Suit 630.\n                                        Alternatively, if it had been so advised, Sports Connection\n                                        claims there would have been a real or substantial chance\n                                        that it would have accepted S&N’s offer to settle\n                                        dated 31 March 2008 (“the March OTS”) and,\n                                        hence, the opportunity to obtain an amount higher than the\n                                        sum that was eventually awarded in the Singapore Assessment.\n                                        I pause here to note that this alternative plea in respect\n                                        of the March OTS is directed against SSLC. 20     A real and fundamental question is\n                                        whether the doctrine of loss of a chance should even apply\n                                        to this case. This query is necessary because of: (a) the\n                                        nature of the claims as pleaded; and (b) the legal\n                                        requirements that need to be proved on a loss of chance\n                                        analysis. 21     In brief, applyingAllied Maples, if the loss in\n                                        question is not dependent on how a third party would have\n                                        acted, it is not a loss of a chance case. In contrast, where\n                                        the loss suffered depends on how a third party would have\n                                        acted, either in addition to the action of Sports Connection\n                                        or independently of it, the loss of chance analysis arises.\n                                        Notably, this specific analysis arises only after the\n                                        primary causation issue has been established,ie, that Sports Connection\n                                        would, on the balance of probability, have acted in a\n                                        certain way (ie, to avail\n                                        itself of the chance) if advice had been given. In the\n                                        analysis at this liability stage, the claim for loss of a\n                                        chance is made out provided that Sports Connection shows\n                                        that there was a real or substantial chance (rather than a\n                                        negligible one) of the third party acting so as to confer\n                                        the benefit on or avoid the loss suffered by Sports\n                                        Connection. This consideration is distinct from the\n                                        assessment of the value of the chance in the event that a\n                                        real or substantial chance has been proved. The degree of\n                                        the chance lost is a matter for the quantification of\n                                        damages and this matter is held over now that the\n                                        proceedings were ordered to be bifurcated; the trial before\n                                        me only concerns the defendants’\n                                liability. 22     It is thus important to discuss\n                                        the question of the proper method of analysing the claim for\n                                        loss of a chance. This case also demonstrates how evidence\n                                        of causation remains of significance in the identification\n                                        and correlation of both: (a) the scope of the professional\n                                        duty (which does not exist in the abstract) that was\n                                        allegedly breached; and (b) what the breach of duty was in\n                                        respect of recoverable loss as pleaded. In other words,\n                                        evidence on causation will have a bearing on evidence that\n                                        pertains to the pleaded “advice”, existence of\n                                        duty in relation to the “advice” and breach.\n                                        Recoverable loss is at the other end of the causal\n                                        link.",
        "Circumstances leading to Suit 630": "23     The genesis of this case stems\n                                        from the failure of S&N to register Sports\n                                        Connection’s Trademark in Malaysia in 1991. The\n                                        application was defective in that S&N omitted to file\n                                        one of the forms required for the\n                                registration. 24     Unknown to Sports Connection, its\n                                        sole distributors of “Bodypac” products in\n                                        Malaysia between 1992 and 1996, Mr Kaw Ah Kin (“Mr\n                                        Kaw”) and his wife, Ms Heng Nguang Keng (“Ms\n                                        Heng”) (collectively, “the Kaws”) who\n                                        were trading under the name of Evergreen Enterprises\n                                        (“Evergreen”), managed to register themselves\n                                        as the proprietors of the same trademark in Malaysia in\n                                        1994. The Kaws also traded under the name of Outdoor\n                                        Outfitters. The couple incorporated a company named Bodypac\n                                        (Malaysia) Sdn Bhd (“BM”) in July 1996 to sell\n                                        Bodypac products supplied by Sports Connection to Outdoor\n                                        Outfitters. Further, the Kaws sold counterfeit Bodypac\n                                        products in Malaysia using BM as their vehicle after the\n                                        supply of the Bodypac products from Sports Connection\n                                        stopped. I shall refer to the Kaws and BM collectively as\n                                        “the KL parties”. 25     In February 1997, Sports\n                                        Connection discovered the misdeeds of the KL parties.

The action was for infringement and\n                                                passing off, procuring breach of contract,\n                                                intimidation and slander of goods. The counterclaim\n                                                in Suit No D5-22-1079-1997 was brought by only\n                                                Tearproof and it was against the KL parties for an\n                                                injunction to restrain the sale of goods and an\n                                                inquiry as to damages. (b)     Suit No D1-22-1252-1997 was\n                                                commenced by Sports Connection against the KL\n                                                parties on 24 November 1997. This action mirrored\n                                                the causes of action and relief sought in Suit No\n                                                D5-22-1079-1997.

They are collectively referred\n                                        to hereafter as “the KL Suits”. Sports\n                                        Connection, Mr Yee and Tearproof were initially represented\n                                        in the KL Suits by Messrs Sng & Co (“Sng &\n                                        Co”) and subsequently by Messrs Michael Chai & Co\n                                        (“MCC”). 28     In Singapore, Sports Connection\n                                        sued S&N on 27 April 1999. Its heads of claim for\n                                        damages in Suit 630 were for: (a)     loss of profits due\n                                                to the sale of Bodypac products in Malaysia by the\n                                                KL parties (“the Loss of Profits\n                                                Claim”); and (b)     legal costs incurred in\n                                                litigation in Malaysia against the KL parties\n                                                (“the Legal Costs\n                                        Claim”). 29     As the on-going KL Suits,inter alia, pertained\n                                        to who was the rightful proprietor of the Trademark and who\n                                        had infringed the Trademark, S&N applied and\n                                        successfully obtained an order to stay the proceedings in\n                                        Suit 630 pending the resolution of the KL Suits. This stay\n                                        order was granted on 15 October 1999. 30     Suit 630 was restored for hearing\n                                        in May 2005. This was after Sports Connection obtained\n                                        interlocutory judgment in the KL Suits with damages to be\n                                        assessed on 28 January 2005 (“the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment”). Costs and interest were also ordered\n                                        against the KL parties. Written grounds of the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment were released on 6 May\n                                2005. 31     I pause to flag a point that was\n                                        raised in this case on the relevance of assessing damages in\n                                        Malaysia following the KL Interlocutory Judgment in order to\n                                        aid Sports Connection’s claim for damages in Suit 630.\n                                        Mr Shahiran’s case is that the damages ordered to be\n                                        assessed in the KL Interlocutory Judgment pertained only to\n                                        Tearproof and not Sports Connection and Mr Yee. I will come\n                                        to his assertion later. Suffice to say for now that a closer\n                                        scrutiny of the KL Interlocutory Judgment revealed that: (a)\n                                        damages that were ordered to be assessed were in respect of\n                                        the Counterclaim filed in Suit No D5-22-1079-1997; and (b)\n                                        that Counterclaim was brought by Tearproof alone. Yet MCC\n                                        reported to Mr Yee in an e-mail dated 28 January 2005 that\n                                        in “respect of all 3 suits, the Judge also ordered\n                                        damages to be paid by Kaw to you to be assessed by the\n                                                Registrar.”[note: 1]The written grounds\n                                        released by the Malaysian court on 6 May 2005 quite clearly\n                                        stated that the order for damages to be assessed was in\n                                        respect of Tearproof’s Counterclaim in Suit No\n                                        D5-22-1079-1997.",
        "Outcome of Suit 630": "32     On 26 August 2005, S&N\n                                        consented to liability with damages to be assessed in Suit\n                                        630. As stated, Sports Connection failed to recover\n                                        substantial damages in the assessment of damages that was\n                                        heard by Assistant Registrar Teo Guan Siew (“AR\n                                        Teo”) from 3 to 5 November 2008. 33     A summary of AR Teo’s\n                                        decision of 15 January 2009 is as follows: (a)     As regards the Loss\n                                                of Profits Claim, Sports Connection had not proved\n                                                its loss; there were insufficient documents and\n                                                evidence before the court to show that Sport\n                                                Connection’s sale of Bodypac products was\n                                                adversely affected by any competing sales of\n                                                infringing products by BM.

(b)     As regards the Legal Costs Claim, the\n                                                legal costs incurred by Sports Connection in the KL\n                                                Suits were determined at RM 418,375.50. Sports\n                                                Connection, however, was only entitled to 30% of\n                                                that amount as 70% of such costs ought to have been\n                                                claimed by Sports Connection as party and party\n                                                costs against the KL parties and not against\n                                                S&N.

        "Developments in Malaysia post-KL Interlocutory\n                                Judgment": "34     After the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment was released, the centre of litigation gravitated\n                                        to Singapore. N&M had Suit 630 restored for hearing and\n                                        from then onwards Sports Connection turned its attention\n                                        towards Suit 630. Significantly, the litigation front in\n                                        Malaysia was limited to specific instructions to MCC to: (a)\n                                        appeal one part of the KL Interlocutory Judgment; and (b)\n                                        tax the party and party bill of costs in relation to the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment. 35     As for point (b), Mr Yee wanted to\n                                        bankrupt the Kaws and to do that Sports Connection was\n                                        advised that it had to first obtain judgment for a\n                                        quantified sum against the Kaws. Taxation of party and party\n                                        costs was cheaper and distinctly a more cost-effective way\n                                        to obtain an order for a quantified sum as compared to going\n                                        through with an assessment of damages in Malaysia. Indeed,\n                                        the contemporaneous documentation showed that Sports\n                                        Connection chose taxation over assessment of damages.\n                                        Factually, it cannot be disputed that no positive steps to\n                                        assess damages before the Registrar of the Malaysian High\n                                        Court in an assessment hearing were ever embarked upon until\n                                        six years later in October 2011. By then, Sports Connection\n                                        had failed to recover substantial damages in Suit 630 (see\n                                        AR Teo’s decision released in January 2009, a summary\n                                        of which is set out above at [33]). 36     A common theme in this case is\n                                        Sports Connection’s lateness or non-payment of\n                                        professional fees. Mr Yee would cite overcharging and\n                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ fees as reasons to\n                                        hold back payment. That stance obviously affected Mr\n                                        Yee’s relationship with his Malaysian lawyers who were\n                                        naturally reluctant to give their full attention to Sports\n                                        Connection’s matters. Even with the best will in the\n                                        world, MCC’s outstanding professional fees would have\n                                        somehow dictated the pace of MCC’s efforts to\n                                        entertain and attend to Sports Connection and its\n                                        matters. 37     I will deal with the specific\n                                        instructions in turn before covering the events that halted\n                                        the assessment of damages in Malaysia prior to\n                                2011.",

In January 2010, Sports Connection’s appeal\n                                        was dismissed with costs. 39     Although notice of appeal was\n                                        filed in 2005, it was not clear if the requisite appeal\n                                        papers were ever filed by 20 April 2005 (which was the\n                                        original deadline intimated by MCC[note: 2]). The progress of the\n                                        appeal could have been held up for an appreciable length of\n                                        time on account of MCC’s unpaid professional fees. It\n                                        is not clear whether MCC completed work on the appeal in\n                                        2007 except to say that the appeal was not disposed of until\n                                        January 2010. It is Mr Shahiran’s evidence that he was\n                                        not told of the appeal until receiving Mr Yee’s e-mail\n                                        of 11 July 2007.[note: 3]",
        "Taxation of party and party costs of the KL Interlocutory\n                                Judgment": "40     It is quite clear from the\n                                        correspondence that Mr Yee wanted to “finish\n                                        off” Mr Kaw by bankrupting him after obtaining the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment. Mr Yee was advised by MCC, on 14\n                                        June 2005, that before proceeding to bankrupt Mr Kaw, a\n                                        quantified sum was required and the advice was to proceed to\n                                        either assess damages, or tax party and party costs awarded\n                                        in the KL Interlocutory Judgment. 41     Besides that route, it was also\n                                        open to Mr Yee to bankrupt Mr Kaw via a different set of\n                                        proceedings in Johor Bahru. This was Johor Bahru High Court\n                                        CS No 22-136-1997 commenced by Sports Connection against Mr\n                                        Kaw for a liquidated sum in respect of goods sold and\n                                        delivered by Sports Connection to Mr Kaw in 2005\n                                        (“the JB Suit”). Sports Connection’s\n                                        lawyer in the JB Suit was one Shalini Sugumaran (“the\n                                        JB lawyer”). I note that on 30 March 2006, the\n                                        Malaysian High Court in Johor Bahru issued its judgment in\n                                        respect of the JB Suit (“the JB Judgment”) and\n                                        awarded Sports Connection a judgment sum of RM\n                                        373,447.94. 42     On 4 August 2005, N&M advised\n                                        Mr Yee not to “slow down” in bankrupting Mr\n                                        Kaw via the JB Judgment and went on to state:[note: 4] We need a quick “liquidated” judgment to\n                                                commence bankruptcy against Kaw Ah Kin and your KL\n                                                case is not a liquidated claim whereas your JB\n                                                matter is. So I do not think this “slowing\n                                                down” will be beneficial to you. 43     The JB lawyer informed Mr Yee on\n                                        20 December 2006 that the sealed copy of the JB Judgment had\n                                        been extracted and before pressing on with the bankruptcy\n                                        application against Mr Kaw, Sports Connection was first\n                                        required to settle the JB lawyer’s legal fees. On 23\n                                        January 2007, Mr Yee instructed the JB lawyer to “go\n                                        ahead” even if the bankruptcy was not necessary for\n                                        the Singapore Assessment as the cost was “only\n                                                RM6k”.[note: 5] 44     Apparently, Mr Yee’s\n                                        realised from reading the JB lawyer’s letter of demand\n                                        to Mr Kaw that the JB Judgment was against Mr Kaw and that\n                                        it could not be used to bankrupt Ms Heng. He then instructed\n                                        the JB lawyer to make Ms Heng a bankrupt using the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment. He gave that instructions to the JB\n                                        lawyer as MCC were disinterested in doing more work after Mr\n                                        Yee had expressed an intention to tax MCC’s bills.\n                                        Understandably, the JB lawyer who had experienced late\n                                        payment of his professional fees asked for a deposit of RM\n                                        5,000 before proceeding. 45     On 12 June 2007, Mr Yee realised\n                                        that it would make more sense to enforce the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment as that route would allow him to\n                                        bankrupt both Mr Kaw and Ms Heng. He instructed the JB\n                                        lawyer not proceed with making Mr Kaw a bankrupt on the JB\n                                        Judgment. He e-mailed Mr Shahiran of this development. He\n                                        also e-mailed MCC’s Mr Kenneth St James (“Mr\n                                        KSJ”), instructing him to enforce the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment. Instructions to the same effect were\n                                        again repeated in an e-mail dated 25 June 2007 wherein Mr\n                                        Yee explained that he needed “to show this bankrupt\n                                        proceedings to the [Registrar]/Court of\n                                                Singapore”.[note: 6] 46     In July 2007, Mr KSJ advised Mr\n                                        Yee again that an order for a quantified sum was required\n                                        and that bankruptcy proceedings could be approached via: (a)\n                                        taxation of the party and party costs in the KL Suits; or\n                                        (b) assessment of damages in respect of the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment (ie, the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment). Whilst Mr KSJ asked for express instructions as\n                                        to whether he should proceed with the Malaysian Assessment\n                                        and/or the taxation of party and party costs, Mr Yee was\n                                        reminded of MCC’s unpaid bills and that work would be\n                                        put on hold until MCC’s bills were settled. Mr Yee\n                                        gave Mr KSJ approval to go ahead to make Mr Kaw a bankrupt\n                                        on 10 July 2007. 47     I digress to point out MCC’s\n                                        chaser to Mr Yee for payment of its professional fees, and\n                                        Mr KSJ’s e-mail on 21 November 2006 where he asked to\n                                        meet Mr Yee to discuss three outstanding matters, namely,\n                                        Sports Connection’s appeal to the Court of Appeal,\n                                        assessment of damages and enforcement of the costs order in\n                                        the KL Interlocutory Judgment. As regards the matter of\n                                        assessment of damages, Mr Yee’s reply to Mr KSJ on 29\n                                        November 2006 was that he did not require Mr KSJ’s\n                                        assistance because he had engaged an expert witness from\n                                        Deloitte & Touche Financial Advisory Services Pte Ltd\n                                        (“Deloitte”) to assist in quantifying the Loss\n                                        of Profits Claim for the Singapore Assessment. At the same\n                                        time, it must be remembered that Mr Yee had already obtained\n                                        the JB Judgment and the standing instruction to the JB\n                                        lawyer was to bankrupt Mr Kaw. Mr Yee’s reply to Mr\n                                        KSJ on 29 November 2006 stated rhetorically that taxation of\n                                        costs order against Mr Kaw would be “futile”\n                                        since Sports Connection’s immediate intention was to\n                                        bankrupt Mr Kaw. For convenience, I set out Mr Yee’s\n                                        reply of 29 November 2006 in italics:[note: 7] … 8. Then, could I suggest again that we meet up to\n                                                discuss what can be done in relation to your Appeal\n                                                to the Court of Appeal ?Please write me, what’s\n                                                  this?

There was a telephone conference involving Mr\n                                        Shahiran, Mr KSJ and Mr Yee on 2 August 2007, and it was\n                                        during that conference call that Mr KSJ received instruction\n                                        to bankrupt Mr Kaw by taxing the party and party costs\n                                        instead of proceeding via the Malaysian Assessment. Mr KSJ\n                                        e-mailed Mr Yee to confirm his instructions:[note: 8] Bankruptcy Proceedings Against Kaw\n                                                  and Wife to obtain a quantified amount of a Judgment debt so\n                                                that you can commence bankruptcy proceedings against\n                                                Kaw and his wife. I am to file a Bill of Costs\n                                                (party-to-party costs) for taxation. I am to\n                                                withhold the Assessment of Damages\n                                                proceeding. 49     On 5 September 2007, Mr Yee asked\n                                        for an update of the bankruptcy proceedings in Kuala Lumpur.\n                                        He was informed by Mr KSJ that MCC was still in the midst of\n                                        preparing the bill of costs, which would take some time as\n                                        there were numerous proceedings spanning eight years. Mr Yee\n                                        forwarded this reply to Mr Shahiran for his\n                                        information. 50     On 21 May 2008, Mr Yee e-mailed Mr\n                                        KSJ for information on the taxation of the party and party\n                                        costs. On 26 August 2008, Mr KSJ informed Mr Yee that he was\n                                        unable to serve the bill of costs on Mr Kaw and Ms Heng, and\n                                        was only able to serve it on BM. 51     Eventually, taxation of the party\n                                        and party costs took place on 17 September 2008 in the\n                                        absence of Mr Kaw, Ms Heng and BM. The Assistant\n                                        Registrar’s decision of 15 October 2005 awarded taxed\n                                        costs of RM 152,688.50 to Sports Connection, Tearproof and\n                                        Mr Yee with interest thereon at the rate of 8% per annum to\n                                        be paid by the KL parties from the date of the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment until the date of payment. The taxed\n                                        costs were not produced at the Singapore Assessment in\n                                        November 2008 which led to AR Teo’s finding as set out\n                                        at [33(b)] above. 52     In a letter from MCC to Sports\n                                        Connection on 16 October 2008, Mr KSJ opined that the amount\n                                        of taxed costs was “way too low and\n                                        insufficient” and recommended that the amount be put\n                                        to review to increase the total costs awarded by the\n                                                court.[note: 9]Mr Yee did not\n                                        reply to this letter. 53     Mr Shahiran appeared not to have\n                                        been kept abreast of the party and party costs taxation.\n                                        Earlier on 22 September 2008, Mr Shahiran in an e-mail to Mr\n                                        Yee complained as follows:[note: 10] Dear Sir, Please recall that I would need a copy of all the\n                                                documents that your lawyers in Malaysia have filed\n                                                in the High Court there. … Further to the above, kindly recall that your Mr. Yee\n                                                has never issued instructions (i.e. that is until\n                                                very recently) that taxation was being undertaken\n                                                against the Defendants in the Malaysian matter.\n                                                Kindly recall that Mr. Rajan Navaratnam was\n                                                instructed to Bankrupt one of the said Defendants.\n                                                And, Dato’ Dr. R.K.

In the circumstances, please let us know whether we\n                                                may have the documents mentioned on an URGENT basis.\n                                                This matter is due to be heard shortly in\n                                                Singapore. 54     For reasons that are not entirely\n                                        clear, there was renewed interest in bankrupting Mr Kaw via\n                                        the JB Judgment after Mr Yee’s earlier instructions to\n                                        the JB lawyer to bankrupt Mr Kaw had stalled for non-payment\n                                        of legal fees and the provision of funds to proceed with the\n                                        bankruptcy application. In or around June 2008, a different\n                                        lawyer, one Mr Rajan Navaratnam (“Mr Rajan”),\n                                        was engaged by Sports Connection to commence bankruptcy\n                                        proceedings against Mr Kaw for non-payment of the JB\n                                        Judgment. Mr Rajan agreed to proceed but Sports Connection\n                                        was required to remit a deposit of RM 3,850 for\n                                        disbursements. Mr Yee agreed to pay on receipt of the\n                                        lawyer’s invoice. On 4 November 2008, Mr Rajan sent a\n                                        letter to SSLC, stating that he had not served the\n                                        bankruptcy notice as he was still trying to determine Mr\n                                        Kaw’s latest address of service. By this time, the\n                                        Singapore Assessment was already underway. 55     For completeness, Mr Kaw was made\n                                        a bankrupt on 9 June 2009 by a creditor bank. Ms Heng was\n                                        made a bankrupt on 11 September 2013 by Sports\n                                        Connection.",
        "No positive steps were taken to assess damages in\n                                Malaysia after the KL Interlocutory Judgment until 2011": "56     Shortly after the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment was handed down on 28 January 2005, there was talk\n                                        between MCC and Mr Yee about taking steps to assess damages\n                                        against the KL parties. The idea in the early days\n                                                (ie, 2005) was for the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment to proceed concurrently with the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. Hence, there were exchanges of e-mails\n                                        between MCC and N&M where MCC in an e-mail dated 14 June\n                                        2005 promised to attend to the assessment of damages in the\n                                        KL Suits “in due course”.[note: 11]Prior to that, Mr\n                                        Yee’s e-mail of 26 April 2005 reminded MCC to\n                                        “try to keep up” with Suit 630 given the\n                                        faster pace of proceedings in Singapore.[note: 12]There was also a\n                                        meeting on 14 July 2005 in Singapore that was attended by Mr\n                                        KSJ, the case-handler of the KL Suits, Mr Leslie Netto of\n                                        N&M (“Mr Netto”) and Mr Yee. Mr KSJ had\n                                        requested the meeting to “brainstorm to come up with\n                                        the best method to compute [Mr Yee’s]\n                                                damages”.[note: 13] 57     After S&N consented to\n                                        liability on 26 August 2005, Mr Yee sought MCC’s views\n                                        on the quantum of damages to be claimed in Singapore. He\n                                        wanted, in particular, MCC’s formula to compute\n                                        damages. Mr Yee wrote to KSJ in these terms:[note: 14] Dear Ken St. James, Please see this 2 letters [ie, letters from S&N’s\n                                                lawyers seeking further and better particulars]! We\n                                                are now pushed to come up with our formula of\n                                                claiming damages. I was hoping, you were able to contribute on this\n                                                crucial requirement. But to date, there is nothing\n                                                at your end. Please let me have your formula, by this evening, as I\n                                                don’t know, what’s done to date. 58     KSJ replied on 14 October 2005,\n                                        stating that he needed more time to finalise the computation\n                                        and that he required further particulars and documents from\n                                        Sports Connection. KSJ also stated that “if the\n                                        Singapore assessment of damages and the Malaysian assessment\n                                        of damages runconcurrentlyand at a different pace, we should proceed with each of the\n                                        respective proceedings accordingly. In other words, perhaps\n                                        it is not expedient to allow one proceeding to hold up or be\n                                        dependent on the other [emphasis added]”.[note: 15] 59     In cross-examination, KSJ\n                                        explained his frame of mind in stating the\n                                                above:[note: 16] A:Yes. I wrote my 14 October 2005\n                                                  email … with the factors of my outstanding\n                                                  bills as well as the, like I said, distorted\n                                                  instructions. So that was -- I recall that that\n                                                  was one of the -- one of the main reasons why I\n                                                  said what I said in the last paragraph, or the\n                                                  second-last paragraph. Whatever work I'm supposed to do on the\n                                                  assessment of damages, I was unsure. I didn't have\n                                                  a clear -- clear instructions. So let the\n                                                  Singapore lawyers do what they need to do, and let\n                                                  -- don't let them – in other words, I was\n                                                  suggesting not to hold back the Singapore\n                                                  assessment of damages. If they are required to\n                                                  move forward much faster, then let them do it, and\n                                                  I will deal with my instructions and what I need\n                                                  to do in the context of my outstanding bills as\n                                                  well as the cross-instructions, as it were, with\n                                                  Mr Yee for the Malaysian assessment. Q:You meant all of that in this\n                                                  email? A:No, that -- I recollect that\n                                                  that was in my mind when I prepared this\n                                                  email. 60     I have already mentioned\n                                        MCC’s unpaid bills and Mr Yee’s November 2006\n                                        reply set out at [47] above to which I refer for context. By\n                                        November 2006, Mr Yee did not require MCC to take steps to\n                                        assess damages or come up with a formula to compute\n                                        damages. 61     I mentioned earlier in [45] above\n                                        that on 12 June 2007, Mr Yee realised that it would make\n                                        more sense to enforce the KL Interlocutory Judgment as that\n                                        route would allow him to bankrupt Ms Heng. I have also\n                                        mentioned that Mr Yee instructed Mr KSJ to execute\n                                        bankruptcy proceedings against the KL parties in an e-mail\n                                        dated 25 June 2007 wherein Mr Yee explained that he needed\n                                        “to show this bankrupt proceedings to the\n                                        [Registrar]/Court of Singapore”.[note: 17] 62     MCC’s bills were still not\n                                        paid. Mr KSJ informed Mr Yee in July 2007 that work at his\n                                        end was held up because MCC’s professional fees were\n                                        not paid. Thereafter on 2 August 2007, specific instructions\n                                        to tax the party and party bill instead of proceeding with\n                                        the assessment of damages in Malaysia were given to\n                                        MCC. 63     The events that happened showed\n                                        quite clearly when, why and how the topic of bankrupting Mr\n                                        Kaw via taxation of party and party costs came up. That\n                                        route was seen to be a cheaper and more cost-effective way\n                                        to obtain an order for a quantified sum as compared to going\n                                        through with an assessment of damages. At that time, the\n                                        objective was to bankrupt the Kaws and to do that Sports\n                                        Connection had to first obtain an order for a quantified sum\n                                        against the Kaws. Indeed, the contemporaneous documentation\n                                        showed that Sports Connection chose taxation over assessment\n                                        of damages. 64     Chronologically, the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment was left dormant since the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment was pronounced in January 2005. On 27 April 2011,\n                                        the defendants were told that Sport Connection intended to\n                                        sue for negligence in respect of the defendants’\n                                        failure to advise Sports Connection to proceed with the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment. Sports Connection’s purpose of\n                                        reviving the Malaysian Assessment was to claim as damages in\n                                        this action the amounts awarded to Sport Connection in the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment.",

Having failed to do so, the causal\n                                        link between the alleged failure to give advice and loss as\n                                        a result of the failure to give relevant advice is missing.\n                                        The analysis goes further as causation is dependent on what\n                                        would have happened if Sports Connection had been given the\n                                        alleged advice. The claim for a loss of a chance arises: (a)\n                                        if it is established that Sports Connection would have acted\n                                        in a certain way; and (b) the question whether loss has been\n                                        suffered depends on how third parties would have\n                                        acted. 75     The leading case on causation in\n                                        the context of lawyer’s negligence isAllied Maples, a decision cited\n                                        by Sports Connection. In that case, Stuart-Smith LJ (at\n                                        1609–1614) stated the relevant principles in these\n                                        terms: [W]here the plaintiffs’ loss depends upon the\n                                                actions of an independent third party, it is\n                                                necessary to consider as a matter of law what it is\n                                                necessary to establish as a matter of causation, and\n                                                where causation ends and quantification of damage\n                                                begins. (1) What has to be proved to establish a causal link\n                                                between the negligence of the defendants and the\n                                                loss sustained by the plaintiffs depends in the\n                                                first instance on whether the negligence consists of\n                                                some positive act or misfeasance, or an omission or\n                                                non-feasance. … … (2) If the defendant’s negligence consists of an\n                                                omission, for example to provide proper equipment,\n                                                [give] proper instructions or advice, causation\n                                                depends, not upon a question of historical fact,but on the answer to the\n                                                  hypothetical question, what would the plaintiff\n                                                  have done if the equipment had been provided or\n                                                  the instruction or advice given?This\n                                                can only be a matter of inference to be determined\n                                                from all the circumstances. The\n                                                plaintiff’s own evidence that he would have\n                                                acted to obtain the benefit or avoid the risk, while\n                                                important, may not be believed by the judge,\n                                                especially if there is compelling evidence that he\n                                                would not. In the ordinary way, where the action\n                                                required of the plaintiff is clearly for his\n                                                benefit, the court has little difficulty in\n                                                concluding that he would have taken it.\n                                                … Although the question is a hypothetical one, it is\n                                                well established that the plaintiff must prove on\n                                                balance of probability that he would have taken\n                                                action to obtain the benefit or avoid the risk.\n                                                … (3) In many cases the plaintiff’s loss depends\n                                                on thehypothetical action of a\n                                                  third party,either\n                                                  in addition to action by the plaintiff, as in this\n                                                  case, or independently of it. In such a\n                                                case, does the plaintiff have to prove on balance of\n                                                probability … that the third party would have\n                                                acted so as to confer the benefit or avoid the risk\n                                                to the plaintiff, or can the plaintiff succeed\n                                                provided he shows that he had asubstantialchance rather\n                                                than a speculative one, the evaluation of the\n                                                substantial chance being a question of\n                                                quantification of damages? … [T]he plaintiff must prove as a\n                                                  matter of causation that he has a real or\n                                                  substantial chance as opposed to a speculative\n                                                  one.

The plaintiffs instructed the\n                                        defendant-solicitors to act for them. The\n                                        defendant-solicitors drafted an agreement which included a\n                                        warranty by the vendor that its subsidiary had no\n                                        outstanding contingencies or liabilities. During the course\n                                        of negotiations, the defendants negligently allowed the\n                                        clause to be amended in such a way that it no longer had its\n                                        effect as a warranty as originally intended by the\n                                        plaintiffs. After the agreement was entered into, the\n                                        subsidiary (now belonging to the plaintiffs) faced\n                                        substantial liabilities which would have been covered by the\n                                        warranty had the defendants not negligently allowed the\n                                        amendment. The plaintiffs therefore brought an action\n                                        against the defendants. On appeal, Stuart-Smith LJ in the\n                                        English Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs had to\n                                        prove on the balance of probability that if they had been\n                                        given the right advice, they would have sought to negotiate\n                                        further with Mr Gillow to obtain protection (at 1610). Once\n                                        that was proved, it was not necessary to go further to prove\n                                        that Mr Gillow would, on the balance of probability, have\n                                        acted to confer on the plaintiffs the benefit of the\n                                        warranty. It was sufficient that the chance (ie, the chance that they would\n                                        have successfully negotiated for total or partial\n                                        protection) was a real or substantial one. 78     InJSI\n                                                Shipping, our Court of Appeal also\n                                        applied this proposition. The plaintiff’s complaint in\n                                        that case was also one of negligence – the plaintiff\n                                        sued the defendant-auditors for negligently auditing the\n                                        accounts, allowing its Asia Director to siphon off\n                                        substantial amounts of funds. One of the plaintiff’s\n                                        claims was for loss of chance to recover the sums\n                                        misappropriated or to prevent further misappropriation. The\n                                        Court of Appeal stated that in order to avail itself of this\n                                        claim, the plaintiff had to prove on the balance of\n                                        probability that if the defendants had not been negligent,\n                                        it would have taken the necessary steps to investigate the\n                                        matter (at [148]). One reason why the Court of Appeal held\n                                        that this had not been proved was because the\n                                        plaintiff’s other director had not even read the audit\n                                        report which the plaintiff complained was negligently\n                                        prepared.

After all, one is concerned with the loss\n                                                which the claimant has suffered, and, for the\n                                                reasons I have given, this cannot, at least\n                                                normally, involve a market value exercise: generally\n                                                it is only the claimant who could have brought the\n                                                action, and, without his having done so, there would\n                                                be no opportunity to recover damages. In my\n                                                judgment, therefore, unless the point is conceded by\n                                                the defendant in a particular case (and in most\n                                                cases I suspect that it will be), the first question\n                                                to be considered is whether the claimant would\n                                                actually have pursued the action to the point where\n                                                he would, subject to the court’s assessment of\n                                                the prospects, have recovered something. Applying\n                                                normal principles, it is for the claimant to satisfy\n                                                the court that he would have pursued the action to\n                                                that extent, albeit only on the balance of\n                                                probabilities. If the claimant fails at that point,\n                                                that is the end of the matter. If he succeeds, it is\n                                                necessary to turn to the second question, namely\n                                                what would have happened if the claimant had pursued\n                                                the action.",
        "Does the loss of chance analysis apply on the facts to\n                                the Loss of Profits and Legal Costs Claims?": "80     An interesting approach to the\n                                        loss of chance analysis advanced by Sarah Green inCausation in Negligence(Hart\n                                        Publishing, 2015) (“Causation in\n                                                Negligence”) is to distinguish\n                                        between chances that are interlinked with the breach and\n                                        those that exist independently of the breach of duty. In\n                                        short, the distinction is between independent and\n                                        interdependent chances. 81     I begin the analysis by referring\n                                        to cases where the English Courts have declined to recognise\n                                        loss of chance as an appropriate head of claim in medical\n                                        negligence cases. InGregg v\n                                                Scott[2005] 2 WLR 268 (“Gregg v Scott”), the\n                                        claimant developed a lump under his left arm, whereupon he\n                                        attended at the defendant’s medical practice, and was\n                                        told by the defendant that it was benign and needed no\n                                        further action. Subsequently, he saw another doctor, and it\n                                        was discovered that the tumour was in fact cancerous and had\n                                        spread to his chest. The claimant sued the defendant in\n                                        negligence, claiming recovery for the loss of chance to have\n                                        a better prospect of recovery if he was diagnosed earlier.\n                                        The trial judge found that even if the defendant had\n                                        accurately diagnosed the cancer earlier, the claimant would\n                                        only have a 42% chance of cure (defined as surviving for\n                                        more than ten years). The expert evidence was that the delay\n                                        in the diagnosis reduced the claimant’s chance of cure\n                                        from 42% to 25%. The trial judge held that because the\n                                        claimant would not have been cured anyway, the delay had not\n                                        deprived the claimant of the prospect of a cure and\n                                        dismissed the claimant’s action. 82     On appeal, the House of Lords, by\n                                        a bare majority of three to two, rejected the claim for loss\n                                        of chance because the claimant had not shown on the balance\n                                        of probability that the defendant had caused the adverse\n                                        health consequences; the claimant had, at all times, at\n                                        least a 58% chance of suffering those consequences\n                                        irrespective of the defendant’s breach. Lord Hoffmann\n                                        was one of the three judges in the majority. He\n                                        stated: 79 … the law regards the world as in principle\n                                                bound by laws of causality. Everything has a\n                                                determinate cause, even if we do not know what it\n                                                is. … ... 82 One striking exception to the assumption that\n                                                everything is determined by impersonal laws of\n                                                causality is the actions of human beings. The law\n                                                treats human beings as having free will and the\n                                                ability to choose between different courses of\n                                                action, however strong may be the reasons for them\n                                                to choose one course rather than another.This may provide part of the explanation\n                                                  for why in some cases damages are awarded for the\n                                                  loss of a chance of gaining an advantage or\n                                                  avoiding a disadvantage which depends upon the\n                                                  independent action of a another person:\n                                                seeAllied Maples… and the cases there cited. 83 But the true basis of these cases is a good deal\n                                                more complex. The fact that one cannot prove as a\n                                                matter of necessary causation that someone would\n                                                have done something is no reason why one should not\n                                                prove that he was more likely than not to have done\n                                                it. So, for example,the law\n                                                  distinguishes between cases in which the outcome\n                                                  depends on what the claimant himself … or\n                                                  someone for whom the defendant is responsible\n                                                  … would have done, and cases in which it\n                                                  depends upon what some third party would have\n                                                  done.In the first class of cases, the\n                                                claimant must prove on a balance of probability that\n                                                he or the defendant would have acted so as to\n                                                produce a favourable outcome. In the latter class,\n                                                he may recover for loss of chance that the third\n                                                party would have so acted. This apparent arbitrary\n                                                distinction obviously rests on grounds of policy. In\n                                                addition, most of the cases in which there has been\n                                                recovery for loss of chance have involved financial\n                                                loss, where the chance can itself plausibly be\n                                                characterised as an item of property, like a lottery\n                                                ticket. … [emphasis added] 83     Is the distinction between cases\n                                        involving financial losses likeAllied\n                                                MaplesandAsia Hotel\n                                                Investmentson the one hand and medical\n                                        negligence cases likeGregg v\n                                                Scotton the other based on principle or\n                                        policy? Sarah Green argues for understanding the distinction\n                                        as based on principle. She suggests inCausation in Negligencethat the factual\n                                        scenarios divide into two types (at p 154): Type\n                                                  1:those in which the\n                                                  chance exists independently of the breach of duty,\n                                                  so that the breach affects a [plaintiff’s]\n                                                  ability to avail herself of that chance, but not\n                                                  the substance of a chance itself. These are cases\n                                                  in which there is a genuine chance to be lost.\n                                                  … Type\n                                                  2:those in which the\n                                                  chance and the breach of duty are interdependent\n                                                  because the breach affects the existence and\n                                                  content of the chance itself.

The\n                                        defendant’s breach of the NCA did not decrease the\n                                        plaintiff’s chances of obtaining the stake, but erased\n                                        it. In both cases, the defendant’s breach, on the\n                                        balance of probability, caused the relevant chance to be\n                                        lost. 85     In Type 2 cases however, the\n                                        chance is interlinked with the breach. Thus, inGregg v Scott, the probability\n                                        of whether the claimant could be cured was already latent in\n                                        the claimant – the defendant’s failure to\n                                        accurately diagnose the condition affected the\n                                        claimant’s probability of cure by decreasing it.\n                                        However, no independent chance was lost. To claim for loss\n                                        of chance in such a case is to beg the question as to\n                                        whether a chance in fact existed. Sarah Green explains (p\n                                        164–165): Claimants in Type 2 cases … are not those who\n                                                have lost a less-than-evens chance, but those for\n                                                whom there is a less-than-evens chance that they\n                                                have lost anything at all. …Since the “chance”\n                                                  in question is really just a measure of the\n                                                  probability that the defendant’s breach\n                                                  altered the claimant’s course of events for\n                                                  the worse, the only question of legal relevance is\n                                                  whether this can be established on the balance of\n                                                  probabilities. … … InAllied Maples, for\n                                                example, the claimants’ relationship with\n                                                their solicitors had no influence whatsoever on the\n                                                content of the chance of their being able to elicit\n                                                concessions from their vendor in the hypothetical\n                                                world in which they could attempt this. What was\n                                                important to establish there was whether, on the\n                                                balance of probabilities, the defendant had in fact\n                                                denied the claimants the opportunity to take\n                                                advantage of such a chance. This sort of conclusion is not one, however, which can\n                                                be made on the basis of Type 2 factual scenarios\n                                                because, in these situations, there is no such thing\n                                                as an independently quantifiable opportunity which\n                                                can be divorced from the question of whether the\n                                                defendant’s breach made the claimant worse\n                                                off. In the Type 2 cases of [Gregg v Scott] … , for\n                                                instance, the claimants’ chances of avoiding\n                                                an adverse physical outcome were inextricably bound\n                                                up with the effects of the defendant’s\n                                                negligent diagnosis. The relevant\n                                                “chance” therefore is not assessable\n                                                independently of the breach, since it is defined and\n                                                determined by it.Given that\n                                                  there is nothing extraneous from which the\n                                                  claimant can be excluded, the question is not\n                                                  whether, on the balance of probabilities, the\n                                                  claimant has been denied access to an opportunity,\n                                                  but whether the claimant ever had such an\n                                                  opportunity in the first place, and whether the\n                                                  defendant’s breach deprived her of\n                                                  it.… [emphasis added] 86     The author thus concludes that\n                                        while Type 1 cases are true loss of chance cases, Type 2\n                                        cases are not true loss of chance cases, as there is no\n                                        independent chance which could have been lost. 87     In the present case, however, the\n                                        complaint is not that an independent chance of succeeding at\n                                        the Singapore Assessment had been lost, although it is\n                                        couched as such. If one examines the claim and the facts in\n                                        closer detail, the chance is not in fact independent of the\n                                        defendants’ breach. Sports Connection’s true\n                                        complaint is that if not for the defendants’ breach,\n                                        it would have had X% chance of success, but because of the\n                                        breach, it had (X-Y)% chance of success instead. As the loss\n                                        in fact eventuated, the legally relevant question must be\n                                        the extent to which the defendants’ alleged breach\n                                        caused that loss. From this perspective, Sports\n                                        Connection’s case falls squarely into the Type 2\n                                        situation advocated by Sarah Green. As a Type 2 case, Sports\n                                        Connection must show, on a balance of probability, that but\n                                        for the defendants’ breach, it would have obtained a\n                                        more favourable outcome at trial. This is the conventional\n                                        analysis of “but for” causation. 88     If Sports Connection’s\n                                        claims were bad to begin with (defined as having a less than\n                                        50% chance of success), it is not clear why it should be\n                                        indemnified for the loss of any percentage chance of that\n                                        success from its allegedly negligent solicitors, since the\n                                        failure at the Singapore Assessment, on a balance of\n                                        probability, would be more likely to be due to the fact that\n                                        the claim was bad, rather than the defendants’\n                                        negligence. I am mindful that no case was pleaded that Mr\n                                        Yee in fact thought the claim for damages in Suit 630 was\n                                        hopeless but Mr Shahiran failed to advise Mr Yee\n                                        accordingly. 89     I say no more about this matter as\n                                        the parties are in agreement as to the basis of a loss of\n                                        chance analysis. Nevertheless, it is open to this court to\n                                        examine whether on the evidence the claim for loss of a\n                                        chance in this particular case in fact existed. Given the\n                                        spectrum of chances, where certainty of chance is at one end\n                                        and nil or negligible chance is at the other extreme end,\n                                        the court’s task is to do its best to place the\n                                        alleged chance within its proper range. It seems to me that\n                                        the arguments on loss of chance in this case are premised on\n                                        “a chance upon a chance” and that begs the\n                                        question as to whether a “real chance” in fact\n                                        existed. I use the words “real chance” because\n                                        that reflects the language used by Stuart-Smith LJ inAllied Maples.\n                                        Clearly, a chance upon a chance is not a real\n                                chance.",

Significantly, an\n                                        analysis of how matters stood when the advice was supposedly\n                                        omitted is pivotal, and I will go through this point in\n                                        detail below. The Statement of Claim averred to what Sports\n                                        Connection would have done had it received proper advice in\n                                        relation to its claim for damages against S&N. The\n                                        omission was “to advise” on, what I have\n                                        termed, “courses of action” supposedly open to\n                                        Sports Connection to take and which Sports Connection would\n                                        have taken if advice had been given. I have set out the two\n                                        main “courses of action” pleaded in the\n                                        Statement of Claim at [68] above. For convenience, I repeat\n                                        them here: (a)     Course of Action 1:\n                                                To stay the Singapore Assessment pending completion\n                                                of the Malaysia Assessment, and to thereafter\n                                                present the amount assessed in the Malaysian\n                                                Assessment as evidence of Sports Connection’s\n                                                claim for loss of profit in the Singapore\n                                                Assessment. (b)     Course of Action 2: That in the\n                                                Malaysian Assessment, it could have “obtained\n                                                evidence in discovery and/or affidavit evidence from\n                                                the [the KL parties] which would have been useful\n                                                for and relevant to the Singapore\n                                                Assessment”. 93     All in all, Sports Connection must\n                                        satisfy three conditions in its claim for negligence and\n                                        breach of retainer in the conduct of Suit 630. The first\n                                        condition is the proper advice argument which is whether the\n                                        defendants’ advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell\n                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer. The\n                                        critical question, which has been set out at [12] above is,\n                                        what advice in all the circumstances of the case would a\n                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran\n                                        have given? 94     The second condition is the\n                                        primary causation issue. As stated at [14] above, the legal\n                                        question that must be answered by Sports Connection is as\n                                        follows: what action would Sports Connection on a balance of\n                                        probability have taken if it had received proper\n                                        advice? 95     With these two conditions\n                                        analysed, the court is well placed to examine the third\n                                        condition,viz, whether the\n                                        loss which Sports Connection claimed that it had suffered\n                                        was in fact caused by the failure to give the relevant\n                                        advice. This collective approach as outlined was explained\n                                        by Slade LJ inBoateng v Hughmans (a\n                                                firm)[2002] EWCA Civ 593 at [35], and I\n                                        gratefully adopt the explanation and approach in this\n                                        particular case. 96     As alluded to earlier, the\n                                        evidence and arguments in this case are closely intertwined\n                                        in that matters pertaining to the core issue of causation\n                                        have a significant bearing on all the other issues of\n                                        negligence and vice versa. I propose to examine the evidence\n                                        that is common to issues of scope of duty, breach, causation\n                                        and loss before returning to answer the three specific\n                                        conditions above. 97     An analysis of the common features\n                                        of this case foreshadows at an early stage the flaw that\n                                        underlines the Loss of Profits Claim. In fact, the state of\n                                        affairs that emerged is tellingly simple: in the particular\n                                        circumstances of the case, the pleaded Courses of Action\n                                        were illusory and fanciful to qualify as\n                                        “advice” that would fall within Mr\n                                        Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably competent\n                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have advised\n                                        Sports Connection to take them.",
        "State of the evidence in relation to the claim for Loss\n                                of Profits in Suit 630": "Summary 98     Right from the time Sports\n                                        Connection restored Suit 630 for hearing in May 2005, it\n                                        experienced tremendous difficulties gathering relevant\n                                        documents and information to substantiate its Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim. For over three years, delays were encountered\n                                        so often that deadlines to give discovery of documents and\n                                        furnish proper answers to Further and Better Particulars\n                                        requested by S&N had to be repeatedly extended.\n                                        Consequently, trial dates were vacated no less than six\n                                        times. The state of the documentary evidence remained\n                                        incomplete to the very end in November 2008. The state of\n                                        affairs subsisting at different periods in time demonstrated\n                                        that Mr Yee was, and I so find, fully aware that documents\n                                        bearing upon Sports Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim\n                                        were incomplete to substantiate its claim. 99     Initially, Sports Connection\n                                        cobbled together an exaggerated claim amount of S$38m as the\n                                        quantum of its Loss of Profits Claim. This was in February\n                                        2006. It was a figure that Mr Yee knew could not be\n                                        supported. He was told by Sports Connection’s auditor,\n                                        Mr Dickson Poon, that some of the numbers that his firm had\n                                        used to put forward this quantum of S$38m were either not\n                                        audited or verified.[note: 20]By\n                                        February 2007, the claim figure of S$38m was drastically\n                                        reduced to between S$1,762,649 and S$1,958,499 by its expert\n                                        witness, Mr Tam Chee Chong (“Mr Tam”) of\n                                        Deloitte. After Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of Suit\n                                        630 in August 2006, Deloitte was appointed “to\n                                        quantify [Sports Connection’s] loss of profit in\n                                        relation to the Malaysian market for sales of BodyPac\n                                        products for the period since the ex-distributor registered\n                                        the trademark “BodyPac” (ie. 1994) to\n                                                2004”.[note: 21]Not only did Deloitte find the figure of S$38m inflated, it\n                                        could not support Mr Yee’s target claim figure of S$4m\n                                        despite numerous documents produced by Sports Connection to\n                                        Deloitte. 100    Mr Tam’s expert report was\n                                        criticised by Mr Foong Daw Ching (“Mr Foong”)\n                                        of Baker Tilly Consultancy (S) Pte Ltd, S&N’s\n                                        expert who looked into the Loss of Profits Claim. In the\n                                        Baker Tilly Report dated 15 October 2007 (“Baker\n                                        Tilly Report”), Mr Foong opined that there was\n                                        nothing in the disclosed documents that could be used\n                                        meaningfully to assess the Loss of Profits Claim. At the\n                                        Singapore Assessment, AR Teo agreed with Mr Foong’s\n                                        testimony, amongst other things, and dismissed Sports\n                                        Connection’s entire claim for Loss of\n                                Profits. 101    It was against this backdrop of\n                                        AR Teo’s findings outlined above that Mr Yee argued\n                                        that Mr Shahiran was negligent in not advising Sports\n                                        Connection to stay the Singapore Assessment and proceed with\n                                        the Malaysian Assessment first. In substance, the picture\n                                        that emerged revealed that Sports Connection’s plea\n                                        that Mr Shahiran ought to have advised Sports Connection to\n                                        take the Courses of Action as pleaded were not, in light of\n                                        the evidence, feasible and viable Courses of Action. Based\n                                        on the evidence, suffice to say for now that the so-called\n                                        Courses of Action were illusory and fanciful and could\n                                        hardly be said to be “advice” that would fall\n                                        within Mr Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably\n                                        competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have\n                                        advised Sports Connection to take them. I will elaborate on\n                                        this below at [145]–[173]. . Claim amount of S$38m 102    Mr Netto of N&M wrote to the\n                                        High Court on 13 April 2005 to restore Suit 630 for hearing.\n                                        A Pre-Trial Conference (“PTC”) was held on 9\n                                        May 2005. At PTC, trial dates for 29 August to 1 September\n                                        2005 were given. Those dates were vacated after S&N\n                                        consented to liability. Interlocutory Judgment with damages\n                                        to be assessed was entered on 26 August 2005. 103    Mr Yee was aware that Sports\n                                        Connection had to come up with a methodology for the Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim and to produce documentary evidence to\n                                        substantiate the claim. As early as 22 April 2005, N&M\n                                        asked Sports Connection to provide documentary evidence to\n                                        support the Loss of Profits Claim:[note: 22] We note that the Amended Statement of Claim only\n                                                provides [Sports Connection’s] sales figures\n                                                up to 1999.Kindly provide sales\n                                                  figures for the period thereafter. You need to\n                                                  also provide us with particulars of\n                                                  Evergreen’s profits.Para 21 of\n                                                the Amended Statement of Claim only gives the\n                                                figures for 1stJanuary\n                                                1994 to 1stAugust 1997.\n                                                Kindly let us have full figures for the entire\n                                                duration of time when damages were suffered and the\n                                                documents that support the same. [emphasis added in\n                                                bold italics] 104    Mr Yee asked MCC to suggest a\n                                        formula to best compute quantum of the Loss of Profits\n                                        Claim. There was a meeting in Singapore on 14 July 2005 that\n                                        was attended by Mr KSJ, Mr Netto and Mr Yee. Mr KSJ had\n                                        requested the meeting to “brainstorm to come up with\n                                        the best method to compute [Sports Connection’s]\n                                                damages”.[note: 23] 105    I note that in July 2005, Mr KSJ\n                                        told Mr Netto and Mr Yee at that meeting that there was no\n                                        hard evidence in support of the Loss of Profits Claim. Mr\n                                        KSJ was questioned in cross-examination about that meeting.\n                                        His testimony that there was no hard evidence in support of\n                                        the Loss of Profits Claim turned out to be spot\n                                                on:[note: 24] Q:Okay. This is the meeting where\n                                                  you say general stuff was discussed, you\n                                                  can’t really remember much about\n                                                it? AYes, not\n                                                specifics. If I can offer something else. I also recall\n                                                  informing Mr Yee’s then Singapore solicitors\n                                                  that, as far as trademarks law is concerned, the\n                                                  courts would more readily infer damages in a\n                                                  trademark infringement or passing-off matter,\n                                                  because the damages or the losses suffered would\n                                                  be loss of business profits, a diversion of\n                                                  business, and loss of goodwill and\n                                                  reputation. And these are intangibles.There is no hard evidence to directly prove these\n                                                  head of losses.I remember advising or\n                                                  suggesting to Mr Yee’s Singapore lawyers\n                                                  that. [emphasis added] 106    N&M had also urged Mr Yee to\n                                        get documents from Evergreen otherwise the Loss of Profit\n                                        Claim would be “speculative”. On 21 September\n                                        2005, N&M sought Sports Connection’s instructions\n                                        on the quantification of the damages. Mr Netto e-mailed Mr\n                                        Yee on 14 October 2005 as follows:[note: 25] Bear in mind that without getting the sales figures of\n                                                Evergreen, the matter of damages will have a strong\n                                                element of speculation and the judge who assesses\n                                                the damage will be justified in drastically reducing\n                                                it. How can we reduce this element of speculation?\n                                                Can we get the sales figures of Evergreen\n                                                quickly? 107    Again, on 11 November 2005, Mr\n                                        Netto pressed for Evergreen’s documents. He wrote to\n                                        Mr Yee:[note: 26] … What is important is what Evergreen sold. If\n                                                we can get their invoices, that can help, provided\n                                                there are enough to make them at least as part of\n                                                the basis of the claim. … I cannot understand how all sales documents in the\n                                                possession of Kaw cannot be obtained by your\n                                                Malaysian lawyers from Kaw’s lawyers.\n                                                Kaw’s lawyers may even comply on\n                                                request. Terry, there is a limited time to get these documents.\n                                                Once we file your affidavit of evidence in chief for\n                                                the assessment of damages, we will have great\n                                                difficulty admitting these documents at a later\n                                                stage. Further, once the Defendants have filed their\n                                                affidavit of evidence, it would be almost\n                                                impossible. So act now. Go to KL if you have\n                                                to. 108    Mr Yee approached Mr KSJ for\n                                        assistance. He queried Mr KSJ whether it was possible to\n                                        require Mr Kaw to reveal his sales of Bodypac products.\n                                        Importantly, he remarked:[note: 27] We should have gotten this, when we are still in the\n                                                courts fighting.Now, it seems\n                                                  that I won the battle but lost the war.[emphasis added] 109    Again, on 24 October 2005, Mr\n                                        Yee e-mailed Mr KSJ, stating that he needed the latter to\n                                        get Mr Kaw to give information on Mr Kaw’s Bodypac\n                                        business from 1994 to 2005. Again, no reply was forthcoming.\n                                        In cross-examination, Mr KSJ’s testified that by the\n                                        middle of 2005, he had been instructed not to proceed with\n                                        the formal application for the Malaysian Assessment, but to\n                                        only assist in the computation of the assessment of damages\n                                        in Singapore. It is however difficult to see how Mr KSJ\n                                        could have assisted in the assessment of damages in\n                                        Singapore when he ignored e-mails from Mr Yee and Mr Netto\n                                        on the matter. 110    I note that given the\n                                        difficulties in substantiating the Loss of Profits Claim, Mr\n                                        Yee accepted in two e-mails of 21 October 2005 that the loss\n                                        was Tearproof’s rather than Sports\n                                                Connection’s.[note: 28] 111    In the background, S&N was\n                                        similarly asking for Evergreen’s documents, amongst\n                                        others. On 5 July 2005, Messrs Rajah & Tann\n                                        (“R&T”) representing S&N sought\n                                        discovery of documentary evidence in support of Sports\n                                        Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim due to the sale of\n                                        Bodypac products in Malaysia by the KL parties. R&T\n                                        required discovery by 19 July 2005, a deadline which N&M\n                                        agreed to. However, Sports Connection was not able to meet\n                                        that deadline, and on 21 July 2005, N&M told R&T\n                                        that “there has been a delay caused by our\n                                        client’s attempts to obtain certain document[s] from\n                                                Malaysia”.[note: 29]A list of documents was compiled for the purposes of\n                                        discovery by 27 July 2005. The discovered list of documents\n                                        was found to be incomplete even though the list was said to\n                                        be the “best” that Sports Connection could\n                                                provide.[note: 30]Dissatisfied, R&T sought specific discovery of documents\n                                        on 3 August 2005. The categories of documents included the\n                                        following: (a)     Sports\n                                                Connection’s accounts for the period 1991 to\n                                                1998; and (b)     documents evidencing Sports\n                                                Connection’s sales figures from 1991 to\n                                                1998. 112    On 28 April 2006, R&T wrote\n                                        to N&M, stating that Sports Connection had failed to\n                                        provide,inter alia, the\n                                        following documents: (a)     the affidavit of\n                                                Evergreen, which Sports Connection referred to in\n                                                providing the Further and Better Particulars dated\n                                                28 February 2006; (b)     the accounting records of\n                                                Evergreen from 1991 to 2005; (c)     the documents\n                                                showing Evergreen’s infringing sales of\n                                                Bodypac products; and (d)     Sports Connection’s\n                                                audited accounts from 1991 to\n                                2005. 113    In reply, N&M informed\n                                        R&T on 8 May 2006 of the following: (a)     There were no\n                                                accounting records of Evergreen or evidence of their\n                                                infringing sales, but Sports Connection had already\n                                                provided invoices from 1992 to\n                                        1995. (b)     Sports Connection had already\n                                                provided their audited accounts for the years 1993\n                                                to 2004. There were no audited accounts for the\n                                                years 1991 and 1992, and the audited accounts for\n                                                2005 would be provided in a supplementary list of\n                                                documents. 114    Besides discovery, R&T\n                                        requested Further and Better Particulars of Sports\n                                        Connection’s heads of claim on 3 October 2005. In\n                                        brief, S&N sought Further and Better Particulars of the\n                                        Loss of Profits Claim and the Legal Costs Claim. That\n                                        included information on Evergreen’s profits from the\n                                        sale of the Bodypac Products in Malaysia and particulars of\n                                        how such profits were arrived at. Sports Connection was\n                                        ordered to provide particulars by 25 February\n                                2006. 115    Sports Connection served its\n                                        answers to the Further and Better Particulars dated 28\n                                        February 2006 on 1 March 2006. In there, the claims were\n                                        quantified as follows: (a)     S$38.49m for loss\n                                                of profit; (b)     S$1m for loss of goodwill,\n                                                reputation and value of the Trademark;\n                                        and (c)     RM 633,590.40 in legal costs incurred in\n                                                Malaysia. 116    The figures were put together\n                                        with the assistance of Sports Connection’s auditor who\n                                        was appointed, on 28 November 2005, to help quantify the\n                                        claims and to provide expert evidence on the costs of sales\n                                        and expected costs of sales as well as what Mr Yee could\n                                        claim as loss of goodwill and reputation. Downward revision of the claim amount by\n                                Deloitte 117    Mr Shahiran took over conduct of\n                                        Suit 630 on 15 August 2006. By that time, directions given\n                                        at PTC held on 3 August 2006 were,inter\n                                                alia, as follows: (a) Affidavits of\n                                        Evidence-in-Chief (“AEIC”) of factual and\n                                        expert witnesses to be exchanged by 28 September 2006; and\n                                        (b) two days set aside in the week of 20 November 2006 for\n                                        the hearing of assessment of damages. On Mr Shahiran’s\n                                        advice, Mr Tam was appointed as Sports Connection’s\n                                        expert witness to quantify Sports Connection’s loss of\n                                        profits in relation to the Malaysian market for sales of\n                                        Bodypac products for the period 1994 to 2004. That\n                                        appointment was made more than one year after S&N\n                                        consented to liability. 118    At the time of Mr Tam’s\n                                        appointment, the court’s directions required Sports\n                                        Connection to produce the expert report and expert’s\n                                        AEIC by 22 September 2006. Unsurprisingly, Deloitte required\n                                        an extension of the 22 September 2006 deadline in light of\n                                        the scope of work that it had to undertake. Mr Shahiran\n                                        applied for an extension of time on 26 September 2006 and\n                                        the court extended the time for the filing of\n                                        Deloitte’s Report to 24 November 2006. The trial was\n                                        also re-fixed to 12 and 13 of February 2007. As we now know,\n                                        this new deadline was difficult for Deloitte to meet for the\n                                        reasons discussed below. The deadline was duly extended to\n                                        28 February 2007 on 24 November 2006 pursuant to another\n                                        application taken out by Mr Shahiran. Consequently, trial\n                                        dates in February 2007 were vacated. 119    On 30 October 2006, R&T\n                                        wrote to Mr Shahiran, requesting further particulars of\n                                        Sports Connection’s Statement of Claim as it was of\n                                        the view that the particulars provided by Sports Connection\n                                        on 28 February 2006 (while N&M was still Sports\n                                        Connection’s solicitors) were insufficient. These\n                                        requests included, but were not limited to: (a) details of\n                                        Evergreen’s profits; and (b) details of how the loss\n                                        of goodwill claim was computed. R&T also took the view\n                                        that Sports Connection had not complied with its discovery\n                                        obligations. In particular, Sports Connection had not\n                                        disclosed certain pages from its annual financial reports as\n                                        well as its income tax documents from 1991 to\n                                2005. 120    It is convenient to refer to\n                                        R&T’s letter of 10 January 2007 to ALC for a snap\n                                        shot of the events that happened in the proceedings after\n                                        S&N consented to liability on 26 August 2005: Dear Sirs, SUIT NO. 630 OF\n                                                1999 We refer to the above matter. Since judgment was entered on 26 August 2005, there\n                                                have been multiple delays caused by your client in\n                                                these proceedings which have prevent matters from\n                                                moving forward and even required the vacation of\n                                                hearing dates. The delays caused by your client,\n                                                include but are not limited to (a) delays in filing and serving supplementary lists\n                                                of documents; (b) failure to furnish complete discovery more than 1\n                                                year after judgment had been entered; (c) repeated failures to provide further and better\n                                                particulars of the Amended Statement of\n                                                Claim; (d) wholly changing its position on the quantum of\n                                                damages to be claimed more than 1 year after\n                                                judgment had been entered, rendering your\n                                                client’s Further and Better Particulars dated\n                                                28 February 2006 nugatory; and (e) engaging an expert witness to quantify its claim\n                                                only around 20 September 2006 when your client was\n                                                due to file its affidavit of evidence-in-chief on 28\n                                                September 2006. We further note that to date, your client has not\n                                                provided any concrete figures regarding its total\n                                                claim for damages. In view of the above, we put you on notice that our\n                                                clients intend to look to your client for any costs\n                                                incurred as a result of these delays. Our clients’ rights in respect of any interest\n                                                and costs to be determined at the assessment hearing\n                                                are fully and expressly reserved. 121    I should explain R&T’s\n                                        comment that the Further and Better Particulars dated 28\n                                        February 2006 had become nugatory. R&T was alluding to\n                                        Sports Connection’s withdrawal of the quantum of the\n                                        heads of claim provided in the Further and Better\n                                        Particulars dated 28 February 2006. In fact, R&T was\n                                        told in November 2006 that the Loss of Profits Claim would\n                                        be based on Mr Tam’s report which was being\n                                        prepared. 122    In the meantime, promises were\n                                        made in November 2006 to give discovery of a substantial\n                                        number of documents that were from Malaysia and that the\n                                        bulk of the documents would be received in December 2006. As\n                                        it turned out, the promises were not kept. As at 23 January\n                                        2007, Sports Connection still had not furnished the\n                                        documents. Mr Swami complained in an affidavit affirmed on\n                                        24 January 2007 that Sports Connection’s repeated\n                                        delays had affected S&N’s ability to prepare for\n                                        assessment of damages and the delays had resulted in the\n                                        parties’ repeated attendances in court to extend\n                                        deadlines. 123    The preparation of Mr\n                                        Tam’s expert report (ie,\n                                        the Deloitte Report) took five months. For its report,\n                                        Deloitte asked Sports Connection for documents such\n                                        as: (a)     a copy of\n                                                BM’s affidavit; (b)     a copy of Sports\n                                                Connection’s Malaysian entity’s audited\n                                                accounts; (c)     Sports Connection’s annual\n                                                sales and cost of sales for Bodypac products in\n                                                Malaysia from 1994 to 2004; and (d)     a copy of\n                                                BM’s financial statements for the period from\n                                                1994 to 2004. 124    Deloitte also wanted\n                                        Tearproof’s management accounts from the date of its\n                                        incorporation, but they were not available. According to\n                                        Sports Connection, it was not Tearproof’s practice to\n                                        keep such accounts.[note: 31]Sports Connection also only had BM’s financial\n                                        statements from 1997 to 2000. Nothing fruitful appeared to\n                                        have materialised from Mr Poon’s request to the\n                                        “Malaysian CPA” for those documents. I note\n                                        Deloitte’s terms of appointment highlighted that\n                                        possible limitations to the preparation of the\n                                        expert’s report, one of which was that the financial\n                                        statements of BM for certain years may not be available. In\n                                        fact, Deloitte had even, via its office in Kuala Lumpur,\n                                        tried to obtain BM’s financial statements post-2000.\n                                        That avenue was also unfruitful. 125    Initial correspondence between\n                                        Mr Yee and Deloitte revealed that the original strategy and\n                                        methodology was to use Evergreen’s profits as the\n                                        basis for the computation of the Loss of Profits\n                                                Claim.[note: 32]Deloitte worked on\n                                        the methodology that required it to use Evergreen’s\n                                        profits but it faced many difficulties because of the\n                                        incomplete information from Mr Yee. Notably, Mr Yee\n                                        expressly acknowledged in contemporaneous communication that\n                                        those difficulties were caused by him not being able to\n                                        provide information to Deloitte. Mr Yee thought of getting a\n                                        court order in Malaysia to compel Evergreen’s auditor\n                                        to provide information that Deloitte would need for the\n                                        quantification and e-mailed Mr Shahiran to ask how this\n                                        information might be obtained in Malaysia,[note: 33]but instead Mr Yee\n                                        settled on getting Deloitte to come up with an alternative\n                                        methodology to compute the Loss of Profits\n                                Claim. 126    By 16 November 2006, it became\n                                        very clear that most of the information that was needed in\n                                        relation to Evergreen and BM were not at all available. Mr\n                                        Yee acknowledged this situation as the “absolute\n                                                truth”.[note: 34] 127    In view of the difficulties\n                                        gathering documentary evidence, Sports Connection was unable\n                                        to serve its reply to Further and Better Particulars\n                                        requested by S&N and Mr Shahiran was instructed to get\n                                        more time on 20 November 2006.[note: 35]Deloitte by that\n                                        time was already warning Mr Yee that he should\n                                        “appreciate that [the] reliability of any numbers\n                                        provided by [Sports Connection] may possible be contested by\n                                        the defendants”.[note: 36]Deloitte also had to send chasers to the staff of Sports\n                                        Connection to provide the documents it required for the Loss\n                                        of Profits Claim. Even when the information was provided\n                                        pursuant to those chasers, I note that Deloitte had\n                                        difficulty reconciling the discrepancies in the data and\n                                        even identified certain material discrepancies in relation\n                                        to the sale of Bodypac products.[note: 37]Mr Yee\n                                        was completely alive to the problems with substantiating the\n                                        numbers from the outset, and in an e-mail to Mr Tam’s\n                                        team member, one Benjamin Thong (“Mr Thong”),\n                                        on 9 January 2007, Mr Yee wrote:[note: 38] … please ensure we [do not] give the impression\n                                                [that] our accounts are not reliable as it will give\n                                                [Mr Tam] [a] hard time when he [testifies] in\n                                                court. 128    It should be noted that this\n                                        e-mail was not copied to Mr Shahiran. In view of the many\n                                        discrepancies, Deloitte made a trip to KL to inspect the\n                                        documents in order to “eliminate any doubts”\n                                        with respect to the documents.[note: 39] 129    I pause to note that the\n                                        correspondences do not reveal the discussions on the\n                                        alternative methodology that was to be employed by Deloitte\n                                        in computing the Loss of Profits Claim. However, looking at\n                                        the Deloitte Report, it is clear that this methodology\n                                        involved,inter alia,\n                                        extrapolating the numbers from the financial years while the\n                                        Trademark was infringed using BM’s sales figures (for\n                                        the years 1996 to 2000) and Tearproof’s sales revenue\n                                        (for the years 2000 to 2005). 130    Meetings between the team from\n                                        Deloitte and Mr Yee did not include Mr Shahiran. In January\n                                        2007, Mr Shahiran started to remind Mr Yee that Deloitte had\n                                        to meet the deadline of 28 February 2007. The deadlines were\n                                        also reinforced by a threat from R&T to take out an\n                                        “unless order” or orders for costs if the\n                                        prevailing timelines were not complied with. At a PTC held\n                                        on 9 January 2007, Sports Connection was directed to serve\n                                        its reply to Further and Better Particulars by 19 January\n                                        2007. At that time, Mr Yee was still actively dealing with\n                                        Deloitte directly and he promised to get “Deloitte to\n                                        see the urgency” of the deadlines.[note: 40] 131    However, even as late as 17\n                                        January 2007, Deloitte was having difficulties reconciling\n                                        the discrepancies between the Sports Connection’s\n                                        export invoices and Tearproof’s purchase invoice\n                                        listings, which should have tallied as Sports Connection was\n                                        Tearproof’s sole supplier.[note: 41]One of Sports\n                                        Connection’s employees attempted to work around these\n                                        discrepancies but not all of them could be\n                                                resolved.[note: 42]In fact, Deloitte\n                                        continued to identify “a huge discrepancy” in\n                                        certain aspects of the accounts provided by Sports\n                                                Connection.[note: 43]Mr Yee then mooted\n                                        the idea of convening a meeting between Deloitte, Mr\n                                        Shahiran and himself on 18 January 2007 so that Mr Shahiran\n                                        could review the actual documents that were the subject of\n                                        Deloitte’s Report. At this juncture I note that\n                                        Deloitte requested Mr Shahiran to obtain access to the books\n                                        of BM by writing to the Official Receiver in Malaysia.\n                                        Deloitte once again requested Mr Shahiran to obtain the\n                                        information on 23 February 2007. It is unclear what\n                                        transpired but as no books of BM have come to light, the\n                                        approach was probably another dead end. 132    On 29 January 2007, a PTC was\n                                        held before AR David Lee, who ordered that Sports Connection\n                                        was to provide its documents and reply to Further and Better\n                                        Particulars no later than 5 February 2007, failing which\n                                        Sports Connection’s claim would be dismissed. Mr Yee\n                                        realising the importance of the order, instructed Deloitte\n                                        to “view this with utmost urgency and fulfil the time\n                                        line as required”.[note: 44]Once again, this\n                                        e-mail was not copied to Mr Shahiran. 133    On 2 February 2007, Mr Yee wrote\n                                        to Mr Shahiran stating that “[t]he verdict is out!\n                                        [Deloitte’s estimate] is at\n                                                S$3,490,695.47”.[note: 45]Mr Yee then\n                                        informed Mr Shahiran that Mr Tam was “confident of\n                                        this figure and [was] willing to stand by it in\n                                        court”. Answers to Further and Better Particulars\n                                        requested were then prepared based on estimate of loss of\n                                        profits initially stated at S$2.5m to S$3.5m.[note: 46]The correspondences\n                                        revealed without more that Mr Tam had made some last minute\n                                        changes to the position in the draft Deloitte\n                                                Report[note: 47], which cut down the\n                                        estimate of the loss of profits in the particulars to S$2.5m\n                                        to S$3m, a departure from Mr Yee’s\n                                        “target” of S$4m that he was willing Deloitte\n                                        to reach in relation to the claim for loss of profits. The\n                                        figures in the final version of the Deloitte Report were\n                                        between S$1.7m and S$1.9m. 134    On 23 February 2007, Mr\n                                        Tam’s draft report was sent to ALC. Mr Shahiran\n                                        responded. He acknowledged the methodology of extrapolation\n                                        used and asked whether the documents used in the report were\n                                        included therein. Mr Shahiran also suggested that the\n                                        computation of damages should continue into the years 2005\n                                        to 2007. Mr Thong, for Deloitte, responded that those years\n                                        were not included as Sports Connection was no longer losing\n                                        any sales. I set out pertinent portions of Mr Thong’s\n                                        reply to shed light on the way Deloitte computed the claim\n                                        for loss of profits:[note: 48] The quantification period determined is a measurement\n                                                of the period in which you allegedly loss your sales\n                                                as a result of the infridgment [sic] of the trademark. As such, it is\n                                                not the point when you are restated as the rightful\n                                                owner of the Bodypac trademark but when you have\n                                                stopped losing sales as a result of the infridgement\n                                                of the trademark. For example, at the present moment in Malaysia, even\n                                                though you have not obtained the reinstatement of\n                                                the trademark, but you are also not\n                                                “losing” sales as anyone who wants to\n                                                buy a Bodypac product could only turn to your\n                                                company to buy such a product. … Therefore, in the same vein, we can only look at the\n                                                period whereby there is more than 1 party in the\n                                                Malaysia market whereby the consumer could purchase\n                                                the Bodypac products as a result of the infridgement\n                                                of the trademark. For example, during the period\n                                                when [BM] was still a live company, a consumer could\n                                                either buy a Bodypac product from your Malaysia\n                                                entity or from BM. So if the consumer buys from\n                                                [Tearproof] you did not lose a sale but however, if\n                                                the consumer chose to buy it from BM, then you lose\n                                                a sale. Then, we would compute all these sales that\n                                                consumers choose to buy from BM as your loss of\n                                                profits. 135    Mr Shahiran’s case is that\n                                        he sent a letter dated 27 February 2007 to Sports\n                                        Connection, warning Sports Connection that the Deloitte\n                                        report might not be accepted by the court, due to the lack\n                                        of important documents and that accordingly, Sports\n                                        Connection should consider if it wished to proceed with the\n                                        Loss of Profits Claim, or only with the Legal Costs Claim.\n                                        Mr Yee disputes ever receiving this letter. 136    Be that as it may, Mr Tam\n                                        affirmed his AEIC on 28 February 2007 enclosing the Deloitte\n                                        Report, with the Loss of Profits Claim valued between S$1.7m\n                                        and S$1.9m. Baker Tilly Report and meeting with Deloitte on 22\n                                February 2008 137    After Mr Tam’s AEIC was\n                                        filed on 1 March 2007, R&T requested documents that were\n                                        used in the Deloitte Report. The documents were delivered by\n                                        Sports Connection to R&T on 10 July 2007. R&T\n                                        subsequently noted that there were still missing documents.\n                                        In October 2007, R&T filed and served the Baker Tilly\n                                        Report in reply to the Deloitte Report. 138    Following the Baker Tilly\n                                        Report, on 18 February 2008, Deloitte asked for further\n                                        documents from Mr Yee: (a)     Tearproof’s\n                                                ledger for the years 1997 to 2006. This was because\n                                                Baker Tilly stated that Tearproof was not a good\n                                                proxy for BM. (b)     Sports Connection’s sales\n                                                figure split between Malaysia, Singapore and\n                                                Thailand. This was because Baker Tilly alleged that\n                                                it appeared highly unlikely that increase in sales\n                                                to Malaysia would result in no increase in any\n                                                indirect costs, such as advertisement, labour, staff\n                                                costs or administration costs. 139    It is safe to presume that no\n                                        such documents were provided by Mr Yee. A meeting was held\n                                        between Mr Shahiran and Mr Yee on 22 February 2008. At this\n                                        meeting, they discussed obtaining BM’s financial\n                                        accounts through Malaysian solicitors. Later that day, Mr\n                                        Shahiran and Mr Yee met with Mr Tam and his colleagues from\n                                        Deloitte. I note that Mr Yee accepted in cross-examination\n                                        that during the said meeting, Mr Tam, Mr Shahiran and\n                                        himself discussed the Deloitte Report and Baker Tilly Report\n                                        and the evidential implications it would have on the\n                                        Singapore Assessment:[note: 49] [Q]:Mr Yee, will you agree that\n                                                  once the Baker Tilly report was issued, there was\n                                                  a meeting between Mr Shah, yourself and Mr Tam,\n                                                  and the sum total of that was that Mr Tam was\n                                                  still confident that he could stand by his report\n                                                  because the Baker Tilly report, all it had done\n                                                  really was to complain about various aspects of Mr\n                                                  Tam’s report, but had not professed its own\n                                                  view of what the losses would be.\n                                                Correct? Basically, he was saying, “All they are\n                                                  doing is throwing stones at me, but they are not\n                                                  building anything, so I’m prepared to stand\n                                                  by my report”. That’s what he said,\n                                                  right? A:Yes, probably so. 140    It was also clear that after\n                                        this discussion, Mr Yee was reassured by Mr Tam that he\n                                        would be able to stand by his report:[note: 50] Q:Isn’t it true that after\n                                                  the Baker Tilly report was released, there were\n                                                  discussions between yourself and Mr Tam Chee Chong\n                                                  and with Shah’s involvement, the upshot of\n                                                  which was that Mr Tam took the view that he was\n                                                  still confident in his report and he could stand\n                                                  by it. Correct? A:Yes. 141    Mr Shahiran deposed in his AEIC\n                                        that one of the issues discussed at that meeting was whether\n                                        the Loss of Profits Claim could be assessed through any\n                                        other entity other than Sports Connection or Tearproof.\n                                        However, Mr Yee and Deloitte concluded that there was no\n                                        better proxy other than Tearproof. Mr Shahiran also\n                                        testified that it was discussed at that meeting whether\n                                        BM’s sale of Bodypac products could be discovered if\n                                        they could find out the orders placed by BM with ELF Trading\n                                        to manufacture Bodypac products in infringement of the\n                                        Trademark. Mr Yee informed Mr Shahiran that he had\n                                        previously provided him with one invoice from ELF Trading\n                                        which demonstrated Evergreen’s purchase of such\n                                        Bodypac products, but Mr Shahiran was not able to locate the\n                                        invoice. In March 2008, Mr Yee handed Mr Shahiran a box of\n                                        documents pertaining to ELF Trading. 142    Mr Yee subsequently e-mailed Mr\n                                        Shahiran to “zero in on [Kaw]’s earlier\n                                        testimony, where he said his sales in [RM] 2m per\n                                        year” to bolster his damages claim.[note: 51]It should be noted\n                                        that documents in this regard had been requested by N&M\n                                        as early as June 2005, but none appeared to be forthcoming.\n                                        Eventually, the Deloitte Report relied on notes of evidence\n                                        of what Mr Kaw said in the Malaysian proceedings, and not on\n                                        Mr Kaw’s affidavit. 143    On 20 March 2008, Mr Shahiran\n                                        e-mailed Mr Rajan, requesting his assistance to obtain\n                                        copies of documents relating to the winding up of BM in\n                                        Malaysia. In or around this time, the hearing of the\n                                        Singapore Assessment was fixed for 21 to 25 April 2008. Mr\n                                        Rajan replied in early April 2008 with details of BM’s\n                                        winding up, although no documents were\n                                obtained. Conclusion on state of the evidence in relation to the\n                                Loss of Profits Claim 144    Given the state of the evidence\n                                        outlined above, the following are the key features. First,\n                                        the chance of obtaining relevant documentary evidence such\n                                        as the range of documents from BM and Evergreen (for example\n                                        at [124]–[127] above) including those identified by\n                                        Deloitte after the Baker Tilly Report was served (ie, further documents requested\n                                        pertained to Tearproof and Sports Connection but the\n                                        entities did not have them to begin with (at\n                                        [138]–[139] above)) was nil or negligible. Second, the\n                                        documentary evidence to substantiate the Loss of Profits\n                                        Claim was incomplete. Despite the state of the evidence and\n                                        the Baker Tilly Report, the expert witness, Mr Tam, was\n                                        willing to stand by his report. Third, the documentary\n                                        evidence to substantiate the Loss of Profits Claim remained\n                                        incomplete despite several extensions of time given to\n                                        Sports Connection to give discovery and serve its reply to\n                                        R&T’s request for Further and Better Particulars.\n                                        In particular, two extension of time had also been granted\n                                        to Sports Connections for Mr Tam to prepare his report.\n                                        Dates set aside to assess damages in Suit 630 were vacated\n                                        at least six times. The first set of trial dates that\n                                        included the hearing on liability was scheduled for as early\n                                        as August 2005. When Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of\n                                        Suit 630, the trial dates were fixed for November 2006.\n                                        Trial dates were vacated along the way, and the Singapore\n                                        Assessment was only heard in November 2008. Finally, Mr Yee\n                                        is an individual who was sure of his own mind. He was\n                                        overall a determined litigant convinced that the alternative\n                                        action in Suit 630 against his former legal advisers S&N\n                                        was more valuable than the Malaysian Assessment would have\n                                        been. By 2006, BM was already wound up by a creditor bank. I\n                                        am driven to the conclusion that Sports Connection would\n                                        have gone ahead willy-nilly with the Singapore Assessment in\n                                        November 2008 to attempt to achieve total recovery even\n                                        though a decision to continue was indicative of something of\n                                        a gamble seeing that the supporting documents were\n                                        incomplete and hope was pinned on Mr Tam’s reputation\n                                        in his field of expertise to carry the day.",
        "Illusory Courses of Action": "145    I have set out the Courses of\n                                        Action as pleaded in [92] above. I will now discuss the\n                                        Courses of Action in turn. Stay of the Singapore Assessment indefinitely for\n                                Malaysian Assessment 146    I find the pleaded Course of\n                                        Action 1 to stay the Singapore Assessment to be illusory and\n                                        fanciful. That assertion presupposes that a stay of the\n                                        Singapore Assessment was viable and could be obtained. It\n                                        was fanciful and was never a realistic prospect for several\n                                        reasons. 147    The evidence points to Mr\n                                        Yee’s decision not to proceed with the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment in 2006 (see [47] above). After the KL\n                                        Interlocutory Judgment was obtained, Suit 630 was restored\n                                        for hearing. Deloitte was appointed and worked on the\n                                        quantum of the claim in 2006. As Deloitte needed more time,\n                                        Sport Connection applied twice in 2006, September and\n                                        November, to extend time to file and serve Mr Tam’s\n                                        AEIC. At PTC held on 13 February 2007, Sports Connection was\n                                        ordered to file and serve Mr Tam’s AEIC by 28 February\n                                        2007. Notably, Sports Connection had until 5 February 2007\n                                        to comply with discovery and reply to Further and Better\n                                        Particulars failing which its claim would be dismissed.\n                                        Quite clearly, no reasonably competent lawyer in the\n                                        position of Mr Shahiran would have advised a stay of the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. Mr Chacko has not suggested the basis\n                                        upon which Mr Shahiran could have gone before the PTC\n                                        Registrar to secure a stay of the Singapore\n                                        Assessment. 148    As can be seen from the\n                                        narrative in [56]–[64] above, there was no desire to\n                                        proceed with the Malaysian Assessment before the conclusion\n                                        of the Singapore Assessment. I also note that it was Mr Yee\n                                        who decided to “drop” the Malaysian Assessment\n                                        back in 2006, 2007 and 2008. It is clear from [47] above\n                                        that it was Mr Yee who decided in November 2006 that he did\n                                        not need to assess damages in Malaysia, did not require Mr\n                                        KSJ’s assistance to come up with a formula to assess\n                                        damages in Singapore and Malaysia and that enforcing the\n                                        costs order was futile as he was planning to bankrupt Mr Kaw\n                                        using the JB Judgment. Consistent with that conduct, is the\n                                        acceptance of Mr Shahiran’s advice on which the\n                                        decision to use Mr Tam as an expert to compute the Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim was made, and Mr Yee’s decision made in\n                                        or around June to August 2007 to rely on taxation of party\n                                        and party costs instead of assessing damages to obtain a\n                                        quantifiable sum for the purpose of bankrupting the\n                                        Kaws. 149    As an aside, Mr Yee had not paid\n                                        his Malaysian lawyers in 2006 and 2007. Separately, he had\n                                        arranged for the Malaysian lawyers’ bills to be taxed.\n                                        He only contacted Mr KSJ in June 2007 when he wanted to\n                                        bankrupt the Kaws using the KL Interlocutory Judgment. As\n                                        stated, whilst Mr KSJ asked for express instructions as to\n                                        whether he should proceed with the Malaysian Assessment\n                                        and/or the taxation of party and party costs in July 2007,\n                                        Mr Yee was reminded of MCC’s unpaid bills and that\n                                        work would be put on hold until MCC’s bills were\n                                        settled. It was confirmed on 2 August 2007 that Mr KSJ was\n                                        to tax party and party costs for the purpose of bankrupting\n                                        the Kaws (see [45]–[46] and [48] above). 150    I reiterate, Mr Yee’s\n                                        instructions to Mr KSJ in July and August 2007 were to get\n                                        party and party costs taxed and not to proceed with the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment. His decision was tactical as the plan\n                                        was to bankrupt the Kaws. Put another way, he wanted to\n                                        finish off the Kaws after the KL Interlocutory Judgment, and\n                                        it was never his intention to spend more money on assessing\n                                        damages in Malaysia which he considered\n                                        “futile” (see [47] above). I find that he\n                                        considered recovery against S&N as being more valuable\n                                        than the Malaysian Assessment against the KL parties. By\n                                        then BM was already wound up and he was going to bankrupt\n                                        the Kaws. There is no evidence as to what happened in the\n                                        period after party and party costs were taxed in October\n                                        2008. I am referring to the gap in the evidence as to why\n                                        MCC had not followed through with its standing instructions\n                                        to bankrupt the Kaws. This evidence seems relevant to the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim. There is nothing in the evidence to show\n                                        that Sports Connection was ready to mitigate its claim for\n                                        loss of a chance to recover legal costs by enforcing the\n                                        award for taxed costs on the Kaws. 151    I now come to the Baker Tilly\n                                        Report which Mr Foong affirmed in October 2007. Yet at this\n                                        time, Sports Connection was not ready with its Legal Costs\n                                        Claim as Mr Yee wanted the appeal costs in Malaysia to be\n                                        claimed in the Singapore Assessment. Sports Connection\n                                        applied in November 2007 to have the Legal Costs Claim and\n                                        the Loss of Profits Claim bifurcated. Naturally S&N\n                                        objected to the application which was dismissed. It was at\n                                        this stage that the PTC Registrar suggested the Sports\n                                        Connection make use of expert witnesses on costs. By this\n                                        stage, the Singapore court was not minded to delay the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. By the same token, quite clearly, no\n                                        reasonably competent lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran\n                                        would have advised a stay of the Singapore Assessment.\n                                        Again, Mr Chacko has not suggested the basis upon which Mr\n                                        Shahiran could have gone before the PTC Registrar to secure\n                                        a stay of the Singapore Assessment. 152    It can also be seen from details\n                                        of the state of the evidence in relation to the Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim in Suit 630 above that the state of affairs\n                                        over a period of three years was one that was consistently\n                                        plagued with delays and trial dates had to be repeatedly\n                                        vacated. The state of affairs subsisting at different\n                                        periods in time demonstrated that Mr Yee was, and I so find,\n                                        fully aware that documents bearing upon Sports\n                                        Connection’s claim for loss of profits in Suit 630\n                                        were incomplete. It must be emphasised that R&T had\n                                        requested for Further and Better Particulars as early as in\n                                        October 2005 and Sports Connection’s replies continued\n                                        to be unsatisfactory even after the Deloitte Report as far\n                                        as R&T was concerned. 153    At a PTC held on 11 April 2008,\n                                        Senior Assistant Registrar Cornie Ng (“SAR\n                                        Ng”) informed counsel in no uncertain terms that her\n                                        patience was wearing thin with the constant delays caused by\n                                        Sports Connection. She further made clear that delays caused\n                                        by Malaysian lawyers in getting documents and passing them\n                                        to Sports Connection would not be acceptable excuses any\n                                        more. SAR Ng’s warnings were issued at the time when\n                                        the April 2008 dates for the Singapore Assessment were\n                                        vacated again. Those April dates were given in February or\n                                        March 2008. 154    Prior to the PTC in April 2008,\n                                        there were two earlier occasions when the court made orders\n                                        for Suit 630 to be dismissed or struck out if timelines were\n                                        not complied with. On 29 January 2007, Sports Connection was\n                                        ordered to give discovery of documents relied on by Deloitte\n                                        and in its reply to Further and Better Particulars by 5\n                                        February 2007 failing which Sports Connection’s claim\n                                        would be dismissed. One year later, on 6 February 2008, the\n                                        court imposed a deadline for Sports Connection to file two\n                                        AEICs, by 18 February 2008, 4pm, failing which Sports\n                                        Connection’s claim would be dismissed with costs. This\n                                        new timeline necessitated the dates fixed for March 2008 for\n                                        the Singapore Assessment to be vacated. 155    Another point to note as regards\n                                        “advice” in the form of Course of Action 1\n                                        – a stay of the Singapore Assessment pending disposal\n                                        of the Malaysian Assessment which was to proceed first and\n                                        for the judgment in the Malaysian Assessment to be used in\n                                        evidence as proof of the quantum of Sports\n                                        Connection’s Loss of Profits Claim – is that a\n                                        stay of the Singapore Assessment for the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment did not feature in the case until Sports\n                                        Connection lost before AR Teo. As I have alluded to earlier,\n                                        the litigation moved to Singapore from Malaysia in 2005 (see\n                                        [34] above). 156    In my view, there is no basis\n                                        for the argument that Mr Yee lost the chance to take the\n                                        pleaded Course of Action 1 because of Mr Shahiran’s\n                                        alleged negligence. Course of Action 1 begs the question\n                                        whether it was a real and feasible option in the first\n                                        place. Reviving the Malaysian Assessment was a chance upon a\n                                        chance in that it depended on the courts in Singapore\n                                        agreeing to stay the Singapore Assessment\n                                        indefinitely. 157    I have already concluded that it\n                                        is illusory and fanciful to imagine that Course of Action 1\n                                        was even an option. In my view, a reasonably competent\n                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran with knowledge of the\n                                        long history of the background facts and the proceedings in\n                                        Suit 630 would not, on account of those circumstances, have\n                                        advised Sports Connection to stay the Singapore Assessment\n                                        indefinitely. As stated, the procedural history was one of\n                                        prolonged delays, instances of orders to strike out Suit 630\n                                        if timelines were not complied with and trial dates vacated\n                                        repeatedly. Despite extensions of time, Sports Connection\n                                        had not been able to produce over the course of three years\n                                        complete documentary evidence needed to support its claim\n                                        for loss of profits. There is evidence that in April 2008,\n                                        Mr Shahiran warned Mr Yee that the Singapore court had given\n                                        Sports Connection more than enough time to prepare for the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. This warning was made in the context\n                                        of the lack of evidence in respect of certain legal fees\n                                        which Mr Yee recently disclosed that he had paid but not\n                                        been included in the report prepared by Dato’\n                                        Kamalanathan s/o Ratnam (“Dato’\n                                        Nanthan”) and which Mr Yee wanted Mr Shahiran to\n                                        claim for in the Singapore Assessment. Mr Yee replied that\n                                        this was his “honest mistake”, and insisted on\n                                        including these claims.[note: 52]Mr Shahiran\n                                        highlighted the pitfalls of such a course of action in an\n                                        e-mail dated 30 April 2008, and requested express\n                                        instructions for a supplementary expert report to be filed\n                                        and for him to apply to have the supplementary report\n                                                admitted.[note: 53]Pursuant to further advice, Mr Yee changed his mind on\n                                        including these further claims. Effect of a foreign judgment on quantum 158    Sports Connection’s\n                                        argument is not about the economic value of a judgment in\n                                        the Malaysian Assessment; its focus is on the evidential\n                                        value it would have in the Singapore Assessment. In this\n                                        regard, Mr Chacko submitted that a judgment in the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment would constitute “irrefutable and/or\n                                        conclusive evidence of Sports Connection’s losses for\n                                        its Loss of Profits Claim”. He relied on ss 13 and 45\n                                        of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed). 159    From the outset, this contention\n                                        that opportunity had been lost of presenting conclusive\n                                        evidence in the form of a judgment on damages assessed in\n                                        the Malaysian Assessment to support Sports\n                                        Connection’s loss of profits in the Singapore\n                                        Assessment is legally flawed. As a matter of law, a judgment\n                                        in the Malaysian Assessment is not conclusive evidence of\n                                        Sports Connection’s loss of profits. In other words,\n                                        there is no underlying basis for its proposition that it has\n                                        lost a chance to present conclusive evidence via the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment to substantiate the Loss of Profits\n                                        Claim. 160    Sports Connection reliance onArul Chandran v Chew Chin Aik\n                                                Victor JP[2000] SGHC 111\n                                                (“Arul\n                                        Chandran”) to support its contention that\n                                        a judgment in the Malaysian Assessment would have been\n                                        admissible in the Singapore Assessment is misplaced. InArul Chandran, the\n                                        defendant there sought to rely on certain remarks made by a\n                                        Malaysian Court on the conduct of the plaintiff. Chan Seng\n                                        Onn JC (as he then was) opined as follows: 140    Where facts are not agreed or\n                                                  admitted by the parties, they must be proved by\n                                                  admissible evidence.

Regard must be had to the\n                                                  Evidence Act as to what amounts to relevant\n                                                  evidence that is admissible.

But this by no\n                                                  means provides the gateway for the flood of facts\n                                                  established in other judicial forums to be\n                                                  admitted as evidence or as conclusive proof of the\n                                                  same facts which are in dispute in another trial\n                                                  where all or some of the parties are\n                                                  different. The general rule is\n                                                  that the production of a previous judgment merely\n                                                  evidences the fact that there has been a judgment\n                                                  and there are certain legal\n                                                  consequences.But tendering the\n                                                  previous judgment and then quoting parts of the\n                                                  judgment at length in a question to which the\n                                                  witness refuses to accept as being undisputed will\n                                                  notper seamount to\n                                                  evidence proving the correctness or the truth of\n                                                  any of the facts mentioned therein. [emphasis added] 161    As noted by Chan JC, “a\n                                        previous judgment making certain findings of fact cannot be\n                                        merely tendered in another trial as proof of the existence\n                                        or the truth of those facts”. Therefore, a judgment\n                                        in the Malaysian Assessment would have no probative value in\n                                        Singapore in relation to the fact of whether Sports\n                                        Connection suffered any loss. Such loss would still have to\n                                        be independently proved in Singapore and a judgment in the\n                                        Malaysian Assessment could never be the starting\n                                        point. 162    Mr Chacko argued that the\n                                        court’s recognition of “certain legal\n                                        consequences” flowing from a foreign judgment\n                                                (Arul Chandranat\n                                        [141]) would include the legal consequence that the KL\n                                        parties are liable. This is a misreading of the case. As\n                                        explained by Mr Daniel, the phrase “certain legal\n                                        consequences” referred to the doctrine of res\n                                        judicata and/or estoppel. Both these doctrines are\n                                        inapplicable in the current case as S&N were not a party\n                                        to the KL Interlocutory Judgment or the Malaysian Assessment\n                                        in 2012. 163Trans-World\n                                                (Aluminium) Ltd v Cornelder China\n                                                (Singapore)[2003] 3 SLR(R) 501 clearly\n                                        states (at [19]) thatin\n                                                personamjudgment of a foreign court\n                                        cannot be relied on for the correctness or truth of any of\n                                        the facts covered there. In that case, the plaintiffs\n                                        attempted to adduce a judgment obtained in the Supreme\n                                        People’s Court of the People’s Republic of China\n                                        as conclusive as to all matters adjudicated upon including\n                                        the reasons given for the decision and the grounds upon\n                                        which the judgment is based.

In the current proceedings, the parties do not\n                                        dispute that damages were awarded to Sports Connection in\n                                        the KL Interlocutory Judgment. The real question is whether\n                                        the losses assessed in the Malaysian Assessment in 2012 was\n                                        that of Sports Connection or Tearproof. Sports Connection\n                                        argued that, in reality, Tearproof’s losses were\n                                        essentially Sports Connection’s losses, as Tearproof\n                                        was merely a proxy for Sports Connection. Mr KSJ, who was\n                                        called as Sports Connection’s witness, said that the\n                                        damages awarded in the KL Interlocutory Judgment was only to\n                                        Sports Connection with damages suffered by Tearproof and Mr\n                                        Yee forming a “subset” of the damages suffered\n                                        by Sports Connection as they are related to the Trademark\n                                        that was owned by Sports Connection. 167    In contrast, Mr Daniel argued\n                                        that the losses assessed in the Malaysian Assessment were\n                                        Tearproof’s as the Ferrier Hodgson Report stated that:[note: 54] … in view that we have limited information on\n                                                [BM], Evergreen/[Outdoor Outfitters’]\n                                                financial accounts to quantify [Sports\n                                                Connection’s] losses, we have opted to combine\n                                                the said information with [Sports\n                                                Connection’s] sales of [Bodypac] products to\n                                                [Tearproof] in the Malaysian Market for the period\n                                                between June 1997 and April 2006 to determine the\n                                                losses suffered by [Sports Connection].\n                                                … 168    Mr Daniel also pointed out that\n                                        AR Teo noted in the Singapore Assessment that Sports\n                                        Connection continued to sell Bodypac products through\n                                        Tearproof during the quantification period and that there\n                                        was no evidence that such sales were adversely affected by\n                                        any competing sales of infringing products. Mr Daniel\n                                        pointed out that even Mr Yee was aware and accepted that the\n                                        losses claimed in the Malaysian Assessment were\n                                        Tearproof’s and not Sports Connection’s (see\n                                        [110] above). In light of the contemporaneous documentary\n                                        evidence, and the fact that the counterclaim in Suit No\n                                        D5-22-1079-1997 in Malaysia was brought by Tearproof alone\n                                        and that the Malaysian Judge awarded damages in the\n                                        counterclaim to be assessed in favour of Tearproof, Mr\n                                        KSJ’s testimony that Tearproof’s loss was a\n                                        “subset” of Sport Connection’s claim was\n                                        ill-founded. The KL parties did not attend the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment in 2012 and Sports Connection could freely argue\n                                        that the losses suffered by Tearproof could be ascribed to\n                                        Sports Connection. In any event, if the Singapore Assessment\n                                        had been stayed in favour of the Malaysian Assessment, and\n                                        assumingarguendothat a\n                                        judgment similar to the 2012 Judgment was obtained and\n                                        presented in Suit 630, it would be open for S&N to\n                                        dispute that the damages assessed in the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment were in truth Sports Connection’s damages.\n                                        In that hypothetical situation, Sports Connection would have\n                                        to prove its entitlement to rely on the Malaysian judgment\n                                        to show that it had suffered recoverable loss. Even so, this\n                                        might not be accepted by the court. Once again, this\n                                        demonstrates Sports Connection’s arguments as premised\n                                        on a chance upon a chance. Prospect of discovering other documents in the Malaysian\n                                Assessment 169    This “prospect” is\n                                        Course of Action 2 which is dependent on the Singapore\n                                        Assessment being stayed indefinitely for the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment to be revived. Course of Action 2 is crafted in\n                                        abstract terms. The absence of details and specificity as to\n                                        the type of documents that could be available from the KL\n                                        parties is symptomatic of this case. 170    Mr Daniel argued that Course of\n                                        Action 2 was untenable. He noted that even Mr Yee was\n                                        “lost for words” when Mr Yee was pressed to\n                                        explain what alleged additional evidence he could have\n                                        obtained in the Malaysian Assessment.[note: 55]The basis of Course\n                                        of Action 2 for discovery assumed that additional documents\n                                        existed and could be ordered to be produced. It seems to me\n                                        that in coming up with Course of Action 2, Sports Connection\n                                        had not given thought to: (a) the earlier unsuccessful\n                                        attempts (outlined in [124]–[127] above) at recovering\n                                        documents; and (b) its explanation for its inability to\n                                        provide additional documents sought by Deloitte after the\n                                        Baker Tilly Report was available. The additional documents\n                                        requested related to Tearproof and Sports Connection and if\n                                        they existed, Sports Connection ought to have made them\n                                        available to Deloitte (at [138]–[139]\n                                above). 171    Notably, no additional documents\n                                        from BM were made available in support of the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment in Ferrier Hodgson Report. This is not surprising\n                                        seeing that BM was wound up in April 2006 by a creditor bank\n                                        and the winding up was before Mr Shahiran took over the\n                                        conduct of Suit 630. 172    I also note Mr Yee’s\n                                        evidence in cross-examination on the Ferrier Hodgson\n                                        Report: Q:Agree with me that Ferrier\n                                                  Hodgson relied on Kaw’s evidence in the\n                                                  underlying matter in Malaysia to say that he was\n                                                  selling products to Bodypac Malaysia, and 90 per\n                                                  cent of his sales was Bodypac Malaysia. So the\n                                                  extrapolated figures there to come with a\n                                                  conclusion as to what the sales numbers were for\n                                                  Bodypac Malaysia. Agree? That is an important part\n                                                  of their report. A:That’s\n                                                true. Q:That is exactly what Deloitte\n                                                  & Touche tried to use in Singapore, which the\n                                                  court in Singapore didn’t accept. Correct?\n                                                  You know this, right? A:Yes, that’s\n                                                true. 173    As it turned out, the Registrar\n                                        in the Malaysian Assessment in 2012 was relying on the same\n                                        evidence as AR Teo in the Singapore Assessment. As stated,\n                                        the Malaysian Assessment in 2012 was uncontested in the\n                                        absence of the KL parties. By 2012, BM was wound up and Mr\n                                        Kaw was adjudicated a bankrupt. This development in 2012\n                                        does not translate to Sports Connection obtaining the same\n                                        or similar result if the Malaysian Assessment had been\n                                        carried out earlier before the Singapore\n                                Assessment.",
        "Issues of breach of duty, breach, causation and\n                                loss": "174    The proper advice argument (at\n                                        [93] above) focuses on the question whether Mr\n                                        Shahiran’s advice (or lack of advice) as pleaded fell\n                                        below the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer.\n                                        Having reached the conclusion that the Courses of Action\n                                        were illusory and fanciful, the Courses of Action were\n                                        hardly “advice” that would fall within Mr\n                                        Shahiran’s scope of duty for no reasonably competent\n                                        lawyer in the position of Mr Shahiran would have raised them\n                                        as advice to Sports Connection and to advise the latter to\n                                        take them. 175    For completeness, I should\n                                        mention Mr Shahiran’s contention that he sent a letter\n                                        dated 27 February 2007 to Sports Connection, warning Sports\n                                        Connection that the Deloitte Report might not be accepted by\n                                        the court, due to the lack of important documents and that\n                                        accordingly, Sports Connection should consider if it wished\n                                        to proceed with the Loss of Profits Claim, or only with the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim. Mr Yee disputes ever receiving this\n                                        letter. I agree with Mr Chacko that Mr Shahiran had not\n                                        discharged the burden which is on him to prove that the\n                                        letter was sent. Be that as it may, this finding does not\n                                        affect my conclusion on the scope of the relevant duty based\n                                        on the standard of the reasonably competent lawyer in [174]\n                                        above (see also [147], [151] and [157] above). 176    Like the proper advice argument,\n                                        the second issue of primary causation (at [94] above) also\n                                        fails. To show the relevant causal link, the legal question\n                                        that must be answered by Sports Connection is what action\n                                        Sports Connection would on a balance of probability have\n                                        taken if it had received proper advice. 177    As to whether it would ever have\n                                        been the case that Sports Connection would have proceeded to\n                                        assess damages in Malaysia before the Singapore Assessment\n                                        if Mr Yee had been advised to go to Malaysia because of the\n                                        paucity of evidence supporting the Loss of Profits Claim,\n                                        there was significantly no satisfactory evidence at all from\n                                        Mr Yee that he would have proceeded in Malaysia before the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. Furthermore, the pleaded Courses of\n                                        Action were dubious; they were illusory and fanciful. As\n                                        such, it has not been proved on the balance of probability\n                                        that Mr Yee would have adopted the pleaded Courses of\n                                        Actions if such “advice” had been given by the\n                                        defendants at any relevant point in time after Mr Shahiran\n                                        took over the conduct of the Suit 630 in August 2006 until\n                                        before the Singapore Assessment. In the circumstances,\n                                        primary causation is not proved, the second stage of the\n                                        third principle inAllied\n                                                Maples(ie,\n                                        whether the chance was a real or substantial one) does not\n                                        arise for determination and that is the end of the claim for\n                                        loss of a chance as formulated. 178    I now turn to the loss suffered\n                                        by Sports Connection. The main focus of Mr Daniel’s\n                                        submissions was that Sports Connection could not establish\n                                        any loss. It seems to me and I agree with Mr Daniel that the\n                                        outcome of the Singapore Assessment was the result of Sports\n                                        Connection’s inability to adduce evidence to\n                                        substantiate its loss. I have set out in detail the state of\n                                        the evidence that was being gathered over three years and\n                                        the documentary evidence remained incomplete until the end.\n                                        I find that Sports Connection’s failure at the\n                                        Singapore Assessment was, on the balance of probability,\n                                        more likely due to the fact that the claim was bad, rather\n                                        than negligence of the defendants. As AR Teo found, there\n                                        was no proof that Sports Connection’s sales were\n                                        adversely affected by any competing sales of infringing\n                                        products. The evidence was that Sports Connection continued\n                                        to sell Bodypac products through Tearproof during the\n                                        quantification period and there was no countervailing\n                                        evidence of competing sales by BM for that period. Contrary\n                                        to Mr Chacko’s submissions, AR Teo did not rule Mr\n                                        Kaw’s statement inadmissible. AR Teo could not have\n                                        found Mr Kaw’s statement inadmissible if the ruling\n                                        was that it was inadequate after evaluation of the statement\n                                        with the rest of the evidence. 179    In part, AR Teo’s decision\n                                        depended on whether he accepted Mr Yee’s evidence of\n                                        facts and Mr Tam’s expert evidence. It has not been\n                                        suggested specifically that Mr Yee should have been advised\n                                        that his factual evidence and Mr Tam’s expert opinion\n                                        would not be accepted, or that he was not properly advised\n                                        of the risk of the court not accepting his and Mr\n                                        Tam’s evidence and in the event in some crucial\n                                        respects their evidence were rejected. Mr Tam’s\n                                        formula to compute loss of profits was accepted by AR Teo\n                                        but the numbers needed for computation of the loss based on\n                                        the formula were lacking. 180    No case was pleaded that Mr Yee\n                                        in fact thought the claim was hopeless, but Mr Shahiran\n                                        failed to advise Mr Yee accordingly. I should also say that\n                                        I reject the suggestion advanced to the effect that Mr Yee\n                                        was unaware of any shortcomings in the evidence to\n                                        substantiate the claim for loss of profits and that he would\n                                        never have pursued the Singapore Assessment if advised that\n                                        it was subject to any significant risk. 181    As stated, the way Sports\n                                        Connection puts its case, the question whether Sports\n                                        Connection lost a chance of being better off financially\n                                        than it did as a result of litigating in the Singapore\n                                        Assessment depends on chances at different stages. To also\n                                        say that Sports Connection lost a chance of obtaining\n                                        conclusive evidence of loss of profits in the Malaysian\n                                        Assessment would not provide itself a claim for damages in\n                                        this action. The suggested damage is the loss resulting from\n                                        not proceeding with the Malaysian Assessment before the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. However, there is no evidence of this\n                                        loss since one cannot use the 2012 Judgment because it would\n                                        be indulging in hindsight reasoning. Neither has Mr Chacko\n                                        specified the type of documents that might have been\n                                        obtained from the KL parties in a hypothetical Malaysian\n                                        Assessment held at the material time. 182    Once Suit 630 was restored for\n                                        hearing, the route embarked upon was to recover damages from\n                                        S&N rather than to pursue the KL parties for damages.\n                                        This is evident from the history of the background facts,\n                                        proceedings and tactics decided upon without the benefit of\n                                        hindsight. The focus of the litigation moved from Malaysia\n                                        to Singapore. Energy, resources and time were directed and\n                                        spent at the litigation in Singapore over a period of three\n                                        years. The Malaysian Assessment was decidedly left dormant\n                                        to concentrate on Suit 630. 183    I have already recounted the\n                                        reasons as to why the Malaysian Assessment was left dormant\n                                        and it is against that backdrop that Sports\n                                        Connection’s allegations in [92] above must be\n                                        examined. Equally important was the state of the evidence\n                                        that was consistently incomplete over a period of three\n                                        years and where delays in Suit 630 were\n                                encountered. 184    In my judgment, Sports\n                                        Connection could not show that it had a real or substantial\n                                        chance of obtaining further evidence in Malaysia from the KL\n                                        parties,a fortori, it was not\n                                        able to show that it would have obtained such evidence on\n                                        the balance of probability even if the defendants had not\n                                        committed the breaches complained of. I must also add that\n                                        Sports Connection’s argument on the evidentiary value\n                                        of a Malaysianin personamjudgment for use in the Singapore Assessment is a complete\n                                        non-starter for reasons discussed above. 185    For these reasons, the Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim fails.",

        "Duty to mitigate": "186    Mr Chacko clarified in his Reply\n                                        Submissions that the nub of Sports Connection’s\n                                        complaint was about Mr Shahiran’s failure to advise\n                                        Sports Connection on the duty to mitigate by: (a) taxing\n                                        party and party costs of the KL Interlocutory Judgment; and\n                                        (b) enforcing the taxed party and party costs against the\n                                        Kaws. As a result of Mr Shahiran’s omission, Sports\n                                        Connection lost a real or substantial chance to recover full\n                                        solicitor and client costs that Sports Connection had\n                                        incurred in the KL Suits (ie,\n                                        the remaining 70% of the solicitor and client costs\n                                        disallowed by AR Teo). 187    I narrated the developments that\n                                        led to instructions to MCC to proceed to tax party and party\n                                        costs for use in the Singapore Assessment in [40]–[54]\n                                        above. Indeed, Sports Connection accepted that Mr Shahiran\n                                        had advised it on the taxation of party and party costs in a\n                                        telephone conference call on 2 August 2007. Mr KSJ in\n                                        cross-examination conceded that Mr Shahrian had asked him to\n                                        proceed with the taxation of party and party\n                                costs. 188    However, Sports Connection took\n                                        a fine point which was that Mr Shahiran requested it to\n                                        proceed with the taxation of party and party costs to get a\n                                        quantified sum as a precursor to bankrupting Mr Kaw and Ms\n                                        Heng and not because he appreciated that Sports Connection\n                                        needed to mitigate its losses in relation to the Legal Costs\n                                        Claim. In addition, Sports Connection argued that Mr\n                                        Shahiran had breached his duty by not following up with the\n                                        status of the party and party costs for more than one year.\n                                        Eventually, the party and party costs were taxed in Malaysia\n                                        before the hearing of the Singapore Assessment, but Mr\n                                        Shahiran had refused to accept the papers relating to the\n                                        taxed costs from Mr Yee as the former took the view that the\n                                        taxed costs were no longer relevant for the Singapore\n                                        Assessment. 189    I make a few points. First, I do\n                                        not follow the logic of the distinction made by Sports\n                                        Connection between taxing party and party costs as a\n                                        precursor to bankrupting the Kaws and mitigation. Various\n                                        correspondences between the parties revealed that Mr Yee\n                                        knew that the bankruptcy of the Kaws would be relevant to\n                                        the Singapore Assessment. In an e-mail dated 25 June 2007,\n                                        Mr Yee instructed Mr KSJ to execute bankruptcy proceedings\n                                        against BM, Mr Kaw and Ms Heng. Importantly, he stated\n                                        “[d]o note, I need to show this bankrupt proceedings\n                                        to the [Registrar]/Court of Singapore”. Again, on 21\n                                        May 2008, Mr Yee e-mailed Mr KSJ stating:[note: 56] Subject: Re: Bill of\n                                                costs on kaw ah kin To Ken St. James, Please furnish full details, including all time lines\n                                                and it’s status. I need this, as due court will query me, why I\n                                                didn’t make kaw a bankrupt, even though the\n                                                judgement in my favour is 3 years old. 190    The fact that Mr Shahiran\n                                        recognised the need to bankrupt both Mr Kaw and Ms Heng\n                                        showed that Mr Shahiran appreciated the need for Sports\n                                        Connection to establish, in the Singapore Assessment, that\n                                        it was not able to recover its legal costs incurred in the\n                                        KL Suits from the Kaws. Notably, AR Teo stated that Sports\n                                        Connection was “precluded from recovering the 70% of\n                                        costs which it could have recovered had it proceeded to\n                                        enforce its entitlement to costs in Malaysia”,\n                                        revealing that the basis of awarding only 30% of the legal\n                                        costs claimed to Sports Connection was because Sports\n                                        Connection should have claimed the remaining 70% from the\n                                        Kaws. Hence, if Sports Connection had shown that the Kaws\n                                        were bankrupt or impecunious, Sports Connection might have\n                                        succeeded in recovering the Legal Costs Claim in full. There\n                                        is nothing to the complaint that Mr Shahiran had not advised\n                                        Sports Connection to mitigate its losses in relation to the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim. 191    Second, party and party costs\n                                        were taxed and the amount of the taxed costs was known on 15\n                                        October 2008. However, the result of the taxed costs in the\n                                        sum of RM 152,688 together with interest thereon at the rate\n                                        of 8% per annum from the date of the KL Interlocutory\n                                        Judgment until the date of payment was not produced at the\n                                        Singapore Assessment in November 2008 and that led to AR\n                                        Teo’s findings as set out at [33(b)] above. Mr Yee\n                                        said that the reason why information and the papers on the\n                                        taxed costs were not produced at the Singapore Assessment\n                                        was that Mr Shahiran did not want them. Mr Shahiran\n                                        disagreed with Mr Yee. Mr Shahiran contended that he was not\n                                        told the results of the taxation. In response, Mr Daniel\n                                        submitted that it was Mr Yee who withheld information on the\n                                        taxed party and party costs and papers from Mr\n                                        Shahiran. 192    I accept Mr Daniel’s\n                                        submissions in light of some objective evidence in support\n                                        of his position: (a)     Mr Yee’s AEIC\n                                                said nothing about Mr Shahiran’s refusal to\n                                                accept the papers on taxed party and party costs\n                                                from Mr Yee. (b)     The amount of the taxed party and\n                                                party costs was disappointingly low and it was not\n                                                in Sports Connection’s interest to reveal the\n                                                amount that was taxed in the Singapore Assessment.\n                                                In fact, Mr KSJ recommended a review as the amount\n                                                of taxed costs was “too low and\n                                                insufficient” (see [52] above). Mr Yee did\n                                                not reply to this letter. Logically, presenting the\n                                                papers in the Singapore Assessment might risk\n                                                reducing the Legal Costs Claim seeing that Sports\n                                                Connection was awarded RM 152,688.50 as taxed costs.\n                                                Even when this amount is scaled-up to solicitor and\n                                                client costs, that amount would be lower than that\n                                                estimated by the experts on costs. S&N’s\n                                                expert, Mr Anantham Kasinather (“Mr\n                                                Kasi”) in his report gave the figure RM\n                                                418,375.50. Dato’ Nathan’s Report gave\n                                                the figure of RM 1 million. (c)     As pointed out by\n                                                Mr Daniel, Mr Shahiran complied and filed Sports\n                                                Connection’s 2nd Supplementary List of\n                                                Documents, consisting largely of documents filed by\n                                                Ms Subitra in respect of the solicitor and client\n                                                taxation in Malaysia on 17 October 2008 in Suit 630.\n                                                I agree with Mr Daniel that in keeping with Sports\n                                                Connection’s continual disclosure obligations,\n                                                the papers on the party and party taxation would in\n                                                the normal course of events have been included in\n                                                the 2nd supplementary list of documents in Suit 630\n                                                if they were handed over to Mr\n                                        Shahiran. (d)     Mr Yee did not reveal that party and\n                                                party costs had been taxed when he testified before\n                                                AR Teo. Mr Yee’s evidence in the Singapore\n                                                Assessment was to the effect that he could still be\n                                                “in the process” of working out the\n                                                costs that BM was supposed to pay in respect of the\n                                                Malaysia Assessment.[note: 57]In\n                                                relation to this point, Mr Yee had misled the court\n                                                in the Singapore Assessment while he was on oath by\n                                                being economical with the\n                                truth. 193    The inference that I draw from\n                                        the totality of the circumstances is that Mr Yee had\n                                        withheld the papers in relation to the taxed party and party\n                                        costs from Mr Shahiran. No question of a loss of a chance\n                                        arises since it was the conduct of Sports Connection and not\n                                        that of a third party that was involved. 194    In conclusion, Sports Connection\n                                        has no basis to complain that Mr Shahiran was liable in\n                                        negligence for not advising that it should have taxed party\n                                        and party costs in Malaysia for use in the Singapore\n                                        Assessment when Sports Connection had in fact done so and\n                                        obtained taxed costs in those proceedings, which it later\n                                        failed to produce before AR Teo in the Singapore\n                                        Assessment.",
        "Dato’ Nathan’s Report and Mr Kasi’s\n                                Report": "195    By way of background, it\n                                        appeared that when Mr Shahiran took over the conduct of Suit\n                                        630 from N&M, the claim for legal costs against S&N\n                                        was limited to the costs incurred in the KL Suits and\n                                        obtaining the KL Interlocutory Judgment on liability.\n                                        Subsequently, around June 2007, Mr Shahiran came to\n                                        understand that there were still matters on-going in\n                                        Malaysia, namely, the appeal to the Malaysian Court of\n                                        Appeal, and that Sports Connection was intending to seek to\n                                        recover the appeal expenses under its Legal Costs Claim in\n                                        Singapore. Mr Shahiran therefore suggested that the\n                                        Singapore Assessment be bifurcated so that the Loss of\n                                        Profits Claim could proceed first leaving the costs of the\n                                        appeal to be quantified later since it was on-going in\n                                        Malaysia at the material time. Mr Yee agreed to that\n                                        suggestion and an application for bifurcation of the claims\n                                        was taken out. The Assistant Registrar heard the application\n                                        but dismissed it. However, he suggested that the parties\n                                        could tender expert evidence from Malaysia to support their\n                                        respective positions in relation to the Legal Costs\n                                        Claim. 196    Pursuant to this suggestion,\n                                        Sports Connection engaged Dato’ Nathan, a retired\n                                        Judge of the High Court of Malaysia, to prepare an expert\n                                        report to support the Legal Costs Claim. Dato’\n                                        Nathan’s Report was exhibited in his AEIC dated 16\n                                        February 2008. Dato’ Nathan’s Report considered\n                                        the following matters involving Sports Connection in\n                                        assessing the solicitor and client costs that were or would\n                                        be incurred by Sports Connection: (a)     the KL\n                                                Suits; (b)     the appeal to the Malaysian Court of\n                                                Appeal; (c)     the taxation of MCC’s\n                                                invoices; and (d)     the JB Suit. Having considered the above, Dato’\n                                                Nathan estimated that the taxed costs exclusive of\n                                                disbursements would amount to RM 1\n                                        million. 197    S&N engaged a Malaysian\n                                        lawyer, Mr Kasi, as their expert in respect of the Legal\n                                        Costs Claim. Mr Kasi was a senior practitioner. In Mr\n                                        Kasi’s Report, Mr Kasi opined that the solicitor and\n                                        client costs incurred by Sports Connection to its solicitors\n                                        in Malaysia in relation to the Legal Costs claim would be RM\n                                        418,375.50. 198    After assessing these expert\n                                        reports, AR Teo opined that in relation to the Legal Costs\n                                        Claim, Mr Kasi’s Report should be preferred and the\n                                        legal costs incurred by Sports Connection in the KL Suits\n                                        were RM 418,375.50. AR Teo held that Sports Connection was\n                                        only entitled to 30% of that amount as 70% of such costs\n                                        ought to have been claimed by Sports Connection as party and\n                                        party costs against the Kaws and not against S&N. In\n                                        this regard, AR Teo noted that Sports Connection did not\n                                        adduce evidence to show that it had proceeded with the party\n                                        and party taxation and taken the necessary steps to enforce\n                                        the taxed costs against the Kaws. 199    Sports Connection alleged that\n                                        Mr Shahiran had failed to advise Sports Connection on the\n                                        issues in Dato’ Nathan’s Report and Mr\n                                        Kasi’s Report. The complaint is that Mr Shahiran\n                                        should have pointed out to it that Dato’\n                                        Nathan’s estimate was at odds with the amount invoiced\n                                        by MCC at that time which amounted to RM 680,000.\n                                        Essentially, Sports Connection argued that Mr Shahiran\n                                        should have pointed out that Dato’ Nathan had no\n                                        explanation as to why a Malaysian court would order taxed\n                                        costs above and beyond the amounts stated on the\n                                        solicitor’s invoices. 200    Sports Connection also argued\n                                        that Mr Shahiran should have pointed out that Dato’\n                                        Nathan had erroneously included the JB Suit in the\n                                        assessment of the taxed costs. The JB Suit was entirely\n                                        separate from the KL Suits and did not arise out of or\n                                        relate to the infringement of the Trademark and could not be\n                                        attributed to the S&N’s negligence. 201    The points mentioned here were\n                                        raised in Mr Kasi’s Report which was exhibited in his\n                                        AEIC filed on 17 March 2008, a month after Dato’\n                                        Nathan filed his affidavit. 202    Having considered the background\n                                        facts and the complaints against Mr Shahiran in respect of\n                                        the differing views of the experts on costs in Malaysia, I\n                                        do not see how these complaints against Mr Shahiran are\n                                        relevant to the Legal Costs Claim and it is not surprising\n                                        that Mr Chacko confined his Reply Submissions to the duty to\n                                        mitigate issue (at [186] above). I say no more about this\n                                        aspect of the complaint.",
        "Advice to tax solicitor and client costs incurred in the\n                                KL Suits for the Legal Costs Claim": "203    In this action, Sports\n                                        Connection seeks to recover as wasted costs the professional\n                                        fees of the Malaysian lawyer, one Ms Subitra, who assisted\n                                        Sports Connection to tax the professional fees of MCC. This\n                                        complaint is based on Mr Shahiran’s erroneous advice\n                                        to tax solicitor and client costs for the purposes of the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim in the Singapore Assessment despite being\n                                        informed by Mr KSJ that taxation was out of\n                                time. 204    At the outset, there is no\n                                        satisfactory evidence that Mr Shahiran had expressly given\n                                        advice that it was solicitor and client taxation, and not\n                                        taxation of party and party costs that was relevant for the\n                                        purposes of the Singapore Assessment. I am mindful that\n                                        Sports Connection was already unhappy with his Malaysian\n                                        lawyers’ bills way back in 2003. Mr Yee felt that the\n                                        bills were too high and wanted to tax the bills of Sng &\n                                        Co and MCC. I refer to a letter sent by N&M to Sports\n                                        Connection on 25 February 2003, which reads:[note: 58] TAXATION: KUALA LUMPUR HIGH COURT\n                                                  SUITS & RELATED MATTERS I refer to the above matter and your query on whether\n                                                you would be able to recover your costs of taxation\n                                                of Sng & Co and Ken St. James’s Bill of\n                                                Costs. Terry there are really two issues here. The first is\n                                                taxation of the costs you have paid to Sng & Co\n                                                or will pay to Ken St. James for theongoingtrial,which you deem very high. The\n                                                second is whether the costs of taxation which you\n                                                incur in Malaysian can be recovered in your suit\n                                                against Ms Swami & Narayanan in\n                                                Singapore. … [emphasis added in italics and in bold italics] In this letter, N&M advised Sports\n                                                Connection that solicitor and client costs were\n                                                “not claimable”, and that party and\n                                                party costs were relevant. 205    In June 2005, Mr Yee contacted\n                                        Ms Subitra to inquire if there was a time limitation to tax\n                                        the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. By September 2005, Mr\n                                        Yee had instructed Ms Subitra to tax the Malaysian\n                                        lawyers’ bills. In April 2006, Ms Subitra informed Mr\n                                        Yee that she had prepared the relevant papers to tax Sng\n                                        & Co’s bill and was intending to have them filed\n                                        the first week of May 2006. Mr Yee then asked Ms Subitra\n                                        about how to go about taxing MCC’s bill. Ms Subitra\n                                        replied that she needed to look at the file to estimate the\n                                        costs based on work that was actually done. Some documents\n                                        were sent to Ms Subitra in early 2006. Ms Subitra was also\n                                        queried about the feasibility of taxing both Sng & Co\n                                        and MCC together, as Mr Yee felt that both firms duplicated\n                                        certain items of work but was concerned that he would be\n                                        able to tax both firms fees at the same time. Ms Subitra\n                                        stated that while she might not be able to tax both bills at\n                                        the same time, she could ask the court for a consolidated\n                                        hearing. Mr Yee agreed “since Ken St. James\n                                        [MCC’s] bill is also not low”.[note: 59] 206    This intention to tax the\n                                        lawyers’ bills continued into the time Mr Shahiran\n                                        took over the conduct of Suit 630 in August 2006 and beyond.\n                                        It seems to me that Mr Yee conveniently used for his own\n                                        purpose the Singapore Assessment as an excuse to press on\n                                        with the taxation of his Malaysian lawyers’ bills and\n                                        sought to claim the legal costs for that from S&N.\n                                        Indeed, Mr KSJ doubted Mr Yee’s explanation and\n                                        queried the relevance of taxing his bill for the Singapore\n                                        Assessment. In an e-mail dated 22 June 2007, Mr KSJ stated\n                                        that the solicitor and client bills which he raised\n                                        “would not be directly relevant to the amount of\n                                        costs that Kaw was ordered to pay you”.[note: 60]Again, on 9 July\n                                        2007, Mr KSJ reiterated his position that he found it\n                                        “unusual that the Singapore Court wants your taxed\n                                        Solicitor-Client costs as opposed to your taxed\n                                        Party-To-Party costs”.[note: 61]The application to tax the Malaysian lawyers’ bills\n                                        was eventually dismissed on 18 March 2008 as it was filed\n                                        out of time. 207    Sports Connection’s true\n                                        intention in taxing the Malaysian lawyers’ bills was\n                                        because Mr Yee was unhappy with the bills incurred in the KL\n                                        Suits. In the papers filed in the taxation of the\n                                        lawyers’ bills, he deposed that the bills were\n                                        “excessive and unreasonable and/or not equivalent to\n                                        the legal services which have been provided”. He also\n                                        deposed that the charges of the two law firms were\n                                        “excessive and/or exorbitant” and that there\n                                        seemed to be an “overlap of charges” for the\n                                        “same amount of work done”.[note: 62] 208    Given the background, the fact\n                                        that Mr Shahiran was copied in communication between Mr Yee\n                                        and Ms Subitra that referred to the Singapore Assessment is\n                                        neither here nor there. According to Mr Shahiran, he never\n                                        advised Sports Connection to tax the Malaysian\n                                        lawyers’ bills and it was something that Sports\n                                        Connection wanted. 209    I refer to R&T’s\n                                        Further and Better Particulars dated 3 October 2005. In that\n                                        regard, Mr Yee sent an e-mail to Mr Shahiran on 16 November\n                                        2006, stating that in relation to the particulars sought\n                                        which pertained to the Legal Costs Claim, Mr Shahiran was to\n                                        note that Sports Connection was taxing the “2 firms\n                                        that did my litigation in Malaysia”.[note: 63]In a reply to\n                                        R&T dated 20 November 2006, ALC informed R&T of the\n                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. Over the\n                                        course of Mr Shahiran’s retainer, Mr Yee sent and\n                                        forwarded Mr Shahiran many e-mails pertaining to his\n                                        taxation of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills. Finally, on\n                                        29 April 2008, R&T wrote to SSLC, requesting copies of\n                                        the notes of evidence, court attendance notes and written\n                                        submissions concerning the taxation of solicitor and client\n                                        bills. 210    In light of all the\n                                        aforementioned matters in [209] above, I accept Mr\n                                        Shahiran’s explanation that he had not advised Sports\n                                        Connection to tax the Malaysian lawyers’ bills and\n                                        that he asked Sports Connection for updates on the taxation\n                                        of the Malaysian lawyers’ bills as he was required to\n                                        disclose them as part of Sports Connection’s discovery\n                                        obligation in Suit 630. 211    For the reasons stated, the\n                                        claim for wasted costs as described in [70(c)] above\n                                        fails.",
        "The March OTS": "",
        "Preliminary points": "212    In March 2008, S&N offered\n                                        to pay the sum of S$200,000 in full and final settlement of\n                                        Suit 630 (ie, the March OTS).\n                                        Sports Connection’s argument is that it had lost a\n                                        real or substantial chance to accept the March OTS which\n                                        would have given it more than what was recovered in the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. 213    As I have alluded earlier,\n                                        Sports Connection’s alternative claim for the loss of\n                                        chance to accept the March OTS isnota case for loss of a chance. Sports\n                                        Connection’s loss did not depend on the hypothetical\n                                        actions of a third party, but instead depended on the\n                                        hypothetical actions of Sports Connection itself if the\n                                        alleged breach had not occurred. In short, the facts\n                                        pertaining to the March OTS fell within the second principle\n                                        inAllied Maples(see [75]\n                                        above). As such, the inquiry concerns the primary causation\n                                        issue,viz, whether Sports\n                                        Connection would have accepted the March OTS if it had\n                                        received the advice it claims SSLC omitted to give. This is\n                                        a matter which Sports Connection must prove on a balance of\n                                        probability.",
        "State of affairs after March OTS until the Singapore\n                                Assessment": "214    S&N served the March 2008\n                                        OTS on 31 March 2008. This appeared to be forwarded to\n                                        Sports Connection on 30 April 2008 accompanied by Mr\n                                        Shahiran’s written confirmation that Mr Yee did not\n                                        want to accept the offer. 215    On 9 April 2008, Mr Shahiran\n                                        e-mailed Mr Yee seeking more information and further\n                                        documents with respect to the Legal Costs Claim as Mr Yee\n                                        was seeking to include many types of costs under this head\n                                        of claim. He also reminded Mr Yee that the hearing was fixed\n                                        for 21 to 25 April 2008. 216    On 11 April 2008, in a PTC\n                                        before SAR Ng, the trial dates were vacated as documents\n                                        still could not be obtained. SAR Ng expressed\n                                        dissatisfaction with the prolonged delays at that PTC. Mr\n                                        Shahiran reported to Mr Yee stating: “In brief Mr.\n                                        Yee, we are at a critical stage of the proceedings. I still\n                                        do not have the affidavits from\n                                                Malaysia.”[note: 64] 217    On 22 April 2008, Mr Shahiran\n                                        sent a letter to Mr Yee stating that given Mr Yee’s\n                                        concurrence and the availability of the expert witnesses,\n                                        the revised dates for the hearing should remain as fixed\n                                        from 7 to 11 July 2008. 218    On 29 April 2008, R&T wrote\n                                        to SSLC, requesting copies of the notes of evidence, court\n                                        attendance notes and written submissions concerning the\n                                        taxation of solicitor and client bills. SSLC replied that it\n                                        could only obtain the notes of evidence from the court in\n                                        Malaysia, and that the solicitors in Malaysia only made oral\n                                        submissions. At the next PTC before SAR Ng on 9 May 2008,\n                                        SAR Ng directed Sports Connection,inter\n                                                alia, to provide handwritten attendance\n                                        notes to S&N, and to apply for the notes of evidence in\n                                        Malaysia. The trial dates for July were vacated. These\n                                        materials were provided by Sports Connection on 14 May\n                                        2008. 219    Besides R&T’s request,\n                                        I have also stated above at [157] that Mr Shahiran was also\n                                        dealing with the lack of evidence in respect of certain\n                                        legal fees which Mr Yee recently disclosed as having paid\n                                        and was now insisting should be included in Sports\n                                        Connection’s claim. Pursuant to further advice, Mr Yee\n                                        changed his mind on including these further claims. In an\n                                        e-mail dated 2 May 2008, Mr Shahiran stated:[note: 65] …please recall the following: a. You have your own lawyers in Malaysia; b.

And, your Malaysian lawyers acted on\n                                                these instructions. 220    In July 2008, the Singapore\n                                        Assessment was finally fixed for the dates 3 to 7 November\n                                        2008. The PTC Registrar directed that the Loss of Profits\n                                        Claim would be heard from 3 to 5 November 2008. In between\n                                        this period to October 2008, Mr Shahiran and Mr Yee appeared\n                                        focussed on shoring up the evidence to support the claims\n                                        for legal costs, as Mr Yee stated that he “want[s] to\n                                        claim all monies already spent in\n                                                Malaysia”.[note: 66]On 17 October 2008, Sports Connection filed its 2nd\n                                        supplementary list of documents and accompanying affidavit\n                                        which concerned documents relating to the Legal Costs\n                                        Claim. 221    In Malaysia, the party and party\n                                        costs were taxed on 15 October 2008. The next day, Mr KSJ\n                                        informed Mr Yee that the taxed costs were too low and\n                                        recommended a review. There was no reply from Mr Yee and\n                                        there was no review. 222    The hearing of Singapore\n                                        Assessment was from 3 to 5 November 2008.

        "What action would Sports Connection on a balance of\n                                probability have taken if it had received proper advice (ie, the\n                                primary causation issue)?": "223    This March OTS was made while\n                                        the trial dates were fixed for 21 to 25 April 2008. It\n                                        appears that Mr Shahiran forwarded the March OTS to Sports\n                                        Connection on 30 April 2008 at the time he wrote to Mr Yee\n                                        to confirm Mr Yee’s decision and instructions not to\n                                        accept the March OTS.

The trial\n                                        dates in the horizon were July 2008. However, the July dates\n                                        were also vacated. Eventually, in July 2008, the Singapore\n                                        Assessment was finally fixed for November\n                                2008. 224    It seems to me that having come\n                                        so far in the litigation, there was no incentive to settle\n                                        at a fraction of the claim amount in the Deloitte Report.\n                                        The next opportunity to advise on the March OTS was after\n                                        the November 2008 hearing of the Singapore Assessment. I am\n                                        mindful that, on 11 November 2008, Mr Shahiran wrote to Mr\n                                        Yee shortly after the hearing of the Singapore Assessment to\n                                        set out his views on how Sports Connection fared in the\n                                        assessment. He expressed his concerns that the assessment\n                                        hearing did not go well. He highlighted the testimonies of\n                                        Mr Tam and Mr Yee as areas of major concern. Mr Yee did not\n                                        see Mr Shahiran’s letter as his advice to accept the\n                                        March OTS. In cross-examination, Mr Yee said that it was\n                                        because Mr Shahiran did not say that “There’s\n                                        no other way”.[note: 67] 225    In my view, the message in the\n                                        letter of 11 November 2008 was clear enough and Mr\n                                        Yee’s attempt to place a gloss over it is baseless and\n                                        without merit. The 11 November 2008 letter discussed the\n                                        following: First, it commented that “the opposing\n                                        solicitor … has through his cross examination, badly\n                                        effected [sic] your\n                                        case”. It then discussed the problems in the Deloitte\n                                        Report arising from the lack of evidence and documents.\n                                        After repeating the costs implications of not accepting the\n                                        March OTS, the letter sought Sports Connection’s\n                                        confirmation that it wished to reject the\n                                offer. 226    The court in reviewing the\n                                        advice rendered in relation to an offer to settle would not\n                                        expect that the solicitor renders comprehensive advice that\n                                        is of great precision. In my opinion, it is sufficient that\n                                        the advice discusses the merits of the case and highlights\n                                        that the March OTS would still be available for acceptance.\n                                        The 11 November letter touched on the merits of the case as\n                                        evinced from Mr Shahiran’s discussion of the evidence\n                                        adduced in the Singapore Assessment. It is implicit in the\n                                        11 November letter that Mr Shahiran was asking Sports\n                                        Connection to consider the March OTS once again. I am of the\n                                        view that Mr Shahiran has, in the 11 November letter,\n                                        sufficiently advised Sports Connection in relation to the\n                                        March OTS. 227    As to whether it would ever have\n                                        been the case that Sports Connection would have accepted the\n                                        March OTS if Mr Yee had been given advice stating that there\n                                        was “no other way” as Mr Yee said Mr Shahiran\n                                        should have told him about, two things stand out: (a) there\n                                        was no specific plea of that point in the Statement of\n                                        Claim, and (b) there was significantly no clear evidence to\n                                        show on the balance of probability that Mr Yee would have\n                                        accepted the March OTS but for Mr Shahiran’s alleged\n                                        breach. 228    A related argument is that\n                                        Sports Connection would have accepted the March OTS if Mr\n                                        Shahiran had advised it to take it as early as April 2008.\n                                        Sports Connection’s complaint is that Mr Shahiran had\n                                        not advised that it should accept the March OTS as it was\n                                        likely that Sports Connection would obtain less than the\n                                        March OTS sum in the Singapore Assessment. 229    As can be seen from the\n                                        narrative of the state of affairs after the March OTS was\n                                        filed on 31 March 2008 (at [214]–[222] above), the\n                                        hearing of the Singapore Assessment was fixed for 21 to 25\n                                        April 2008. At that time, Mr Yee was still seeking to\n                                        include other types of costs under the Legal Costs Claim. It\n                                        was not surprising to see Mr Shahiran confirming Mr\n                                        Yee’s rejection of the March OTS. 230    Besides, Sports\n                                        Connection’s submission in [228] is hard to believe\n                                        for a variety of reasons. The loss that was being alleged is\n                                        the difference between the March OTS sum and the sum of RM\n                                        160,512.65 (approximately S$66,716.26) which was what was\n                                        eventually recovered in the Singapore Assessment. Given the\n                                        costs expended in the Malaysian proceedings at that time and\n                                        the size of Sports Connection’s claim (with the Loss\n                                        of Profits Claim valued between S$1.7m–S$1.9 m and the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim valued at about RM 1 million), it is\n                                        unlikely on the balance of probability that Sports\n                                        Connection would have accepted the March OTS however\n                                        well-advised it was. 231    As noted in my analysis of the\n                                        Loss of Profits Claim, Mr Yee was confident in Mr\n                                        Tam’s ability to stand by the Deloitte Report despite\n                                        the Baker Tilly Report. Also, as noted in my analysis of the\n                                        Legal Costs Claim, Mr Yee was equally content to go along\n                                        with Dato’ Nathan’s Report which opined a figure\n                                        much higher than the party and party costs that was taxed in\n                                        October 2008. In this regard, it is also significant that in\n                                        Suit 630, the expert witness for S&N, Mr Kasi, had\n                                        opined that Sports Connection should be entitled to at least\n                                        RM 292,862.85 (approximately S$125,000). Mr Kasi also\n                                        estimated the Legal Costs Claim at about RM 418,375.50\n                                        (approximately S$173,000). These would have been relevant\n                                        facts for Sports Connection to take on board.",
        "Conclusion on the March OTS": "232    In sum, I find that Mr Shahiran\n                                        had sufficiently advised Sports Connection on the March OTS.\n                                        Even assuming for the sake of argument that the advice\n                                        rendered to Sports Connection was inadequate, I would not\n                                        hold Mr Shahiran liable for negligence because I am of the\n                                        view that Sports Connection has not proved on a balance of\n                                        probability that it would have accepted the March OTS in the\n                                        circumstances subsisting at the material time.",
        "Wasted Costs": "233    Sports Connection has an\n                                        alternative claim for wasted costs in [70(e)] above being\n                                        the legal fees paid to the defendants in the sum of\n                                        S$305,345.20. The argument is that it wasted legal fees in\n                                        respect of the Loss of Profits Claim, as Sports Connection\n                                        was not awarded any damages for this head of claim in the\n                                        Singapore Assessment, even though it incurred significant\n                                        legal costs in that respect. 234    As noted, Sports Connection also\n                                        argued that should Mr Shahiran be held to have erroneously\n                                        advised it to embark on solicitor and client taxation, it\n                                        would have incurred wasted costs in relation to the legal\n                                        costs paid to Ms Subitra on the taxation of the Malaysian\n                                        lawyers’ bills and the costs of RM 30,000 it was\n                                        ordered to pay after its taxation petition was dismissed.\n                                        This is the wasted costs as described in [70(c)] above and\n                                        has been dealt with at [203]–[211]\n                                above. 235    There is no merit to this claim\n                                        for wasted costs of litigation as I have already concluded\n                                        that Mr Yee would have in any case proceeded with the\n                                        Singapore Assessment. 236    As an aside, I should mention\n                                        the history of Mr Yee’s unhappiness with the\n                                        defendants’ bills. The genesis of it had nothing to do\n                                        with Mr Shahiran’s negligence. 237    Shortly after the files in\n                                        relation to Suit 630 were transferred to Legis Point LLC in\n                                        June 2009, Sports Connection in July 2009 asked for the\n                                        bills of ALC and SSLC to be taxed. The hearing took place in\n                                        March 2010 and the High Court’s decision is reported\n                                        asSports Connection Pte Ltd v Asia Law\n                                                Corp and another[2010] 4 SLR 590\n                                                (“Sports Connection\n                                                (Taxation)”). It will be seen inSports Connection\n                                                (Taxation)at [44] that the Judge took\n                                        the view that there was no evidence of overcharging on the\n                                        part of the defendants. The Judge also made the following\n                                        observations on Sports Connection’s motives behind\n                                        bringing the application: 42    … Evidently there was\n                                                  sufficient information to enable [Sports\n                                                  Connection] to make an informed decision to pay\n                                                  the bulk of the invoices raised by the\n                                                  [defendants]. In fact from the evidence before me,\n                                                  in particular the conduct of [Sports Connection],\n                                                  it was clear that it did not believe that there\n                                                  was overcharging by the [defendants] as and when\n                                                  each of the successive invoices was raised. It was\n                                                  not without significance that the dispute over the\n                                                  fees only emerged after the outcome of the\n                                                  assessment. Obviously [Sports Connection] was not\n                                                  entirely pleased with the end result but this, in\n                                                  my view, does not amount to special\n                                                  circumstances. 43    It did not escape my attention\n                                                  that [Sports Connection] similarly applied to tax\n                                                  the costs of its Malaysian solicitors in respect\n                                                  of work done for the litigation against the\n                                                  parties who had infringed [Sports\n                                                  Connection’s] trademark in Malaysia long\n                                                  after the bills were paid or, in any event,\n                                                  outside the prescribed period (in Malaysia, the\n                                                  period is six months). It was no coincidence that\n                                                  alleged overcharging by the solicitors was the\n                                                  principal ground relied on by [Sports Connection]\n                                                  for leave to tax the bills. The application was\n                                                  dismissed by the Malaysian court in March 2008\n                                                  more than 18 months prior to the filing of the\n                                                  present OS. Although this dismissal is strictly\n                                                  irrelevant as to whether there was overcharging by\n                                                  the [Defendants] for their conduct of the Suit, it\n                                                  served to highlight the fact that [Sports\n                                                  Connection] was, on all accounts,a sophisticated litigant who is\n                                                  adequately familiar with solicitors’ costs\n                                                  and access to taxation.The fact that five sets of solicitors\n                                                  were altogether instructed in relation\n                                                  to[Suit 630] merely\n                                                  reinforced the point.

The Law Society Complaint was dismissed\n                                        by the Law Society in November 2011. I note in passing that\n                                        there was no allegation by Mr Yee that Mr Shahiran was\n                                        negligent in the conduct of Suit 630 in the Law Society\n                                        Complaint. 240    On 1 September 2011 –\n                                        about two years after Mr Shahiran ceased to have conduct of\n                                        Suit 630 – Sports Connection commenced the current\n                                        action against N&M, ALC and SSLC.",
