        "Decision": "The short issues were whether:(i) a fiduciary duty on the part of the defendant as Managing Director or special circumstances existed between the plaintiffs and the defendant requiring material disclosure by him;(ii) there was misrepresentation by the defendant.",
        "Law": "The existence of fiduciary duty or special circumstancesThe law generally treats a company director, being its trustee and agent as a fiduciary. He may not make a secret profit from holding his office. Consequently, he owes a fiduciary duty to the company. However, he is generally regarded as not owing any such duty to shareholders of the company since the company is a separate entity from its shareholders. The latter principle of law, long observed, was stated a hundred years ago inPercival v Wright(Unreported) . In that case, the directors bought certain shares from a number of shareholders. The shareholders had approached and had offered to sell the shares to the directors. The directors at that time had an offer from a third party to purchase the whole undertaking in the said company. The directors did not disclose this fact to the shareholders from whom they purchased the shares. Although the purchase by the third party failed to go through, the shareholders sued the directors for non-disclosure of the third party`s offer and asked for a rescission of the sale submitting that they would have obtained a higher price for their shares if that information which had deliberately been concealed from them had been revealed to them by the directors. Swinden Eady J held:... the purchasing directors were under no obligation to disclose to their vendor shareholders the negotiations which ultimately proved abortive. The contrary view would place directors in a most invidious position, as they could not buy or sell shares without disclosing negotiations, a premature disclosure of which might well be against the best interest of the company. I am of opinion that directors are not in that position.There is no question of unfair dealing in this case. The directors did not approach the shareholders with the view of obtaining their shares. The shareholders approached the directors and named the price at which they were desirous of selling. The plaintiffs` case wholly fails, and must be dismissed with costs.One of the difficulties postulated inPercival v Wrightwas as to what information should be released by directors to shareholders. Plaintiffs` counsel in that case conceded that not all information known to directors should be made available also to shareholders. Counsel accepted on plaintiffs` behalf that directors were, as to information acquired in the ordinary course of management, `tacitly released` from their duty of disclosure. Counsel for the plaintiffs went on to state:The defendants, for instance, would not have been bound to disclose a large casual profit, the discovery of a new vein, or the prospect of a good dividend.InThe Law Relating to Actionable Non-Disclosure and Other Breaches of Duty in Relations of Confidence, Influence and Advantageby GS Bower (2nd Ed, 1990, by Sir Alexander Kingcome Turner) the learned author explained the decision inPercival v Wright(at para.18.53):In particular, the court did not hold that there might not beparticular circumstances, going beyond those inherent in the ordinary relation of director and shareholder, in which the imposition of fiduciary duties of disclosure would be entirely appropriate. [Emphasis added.]SincePercival v Wrightthere have therefore been a number of cases both in the United Kingdom and overseas which recognise that in particular or special circumstances some duties arise between directors and shareholders either requiring disclosure because a special relationship exists between the directors and the shareholders or because matters arise where shareholders have to necessarily rely on what directors say or do. In the latter type of case there is a guarded departure if any from the general principle set out inPercival v Wright.Thus, inColeman v Myers[1977] 2 NZLR 225in a transaction between directors and shareholders, the Court of Appeal in New Zealand held that special circumstances arose in the case giving rise to a fiduciary duty arising between the parties necessitating material disclosure by the directors because of the family character of the company, the position of the directors in the family and the company, their high degree of insider knowledge and the manner in which the directors had gone about persuading shareholders to sell their shares.InGlavanics v Brunninghausen[1996] 19 ACSR 204, an Australian case, the court held that fiduciary relationship between a director and a shareholder who was also a director, (but an inactive one) existed. The brief facts were that the relationship between the two directors G & B, having deteriorated, G, the inactive director, agreed to sell his one-sixth shareholding to B. However, prior to the agreement B had received an offer for the purchase of the company business of which he did not inform G. B having bought G`s shares thereafter sold the company to the purchaser. The court was of the view that although there was no relationship of confidence and trust between G & B it nevertheless recognised several factors inherent in the case which gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between G and B, namely, a direct sale of shares by G to B; the fact of there being only the said two shareholders in the company which made it realistically impossible to distinguish between a fiduciary duty owed to a company and that owed to the shareholders and very importantly the evidence had gone on to show G`s complete dependence on B for information and advice and the prior offer of purchase of the business of the company by another in the circumstances was regarded as material factor which B ought to have disclosed to G as the information was sensitive to the pricing of the shares that G sold to B. On appeal the Court of Appeal of New South Wales affirmed the decision:Brunninghausen v Glavanics[1999] 32 ACSR 294. In so upholding the decision, the appellate court opined that whilst the general principle that a director`s fiduciary duties are owed to the company and not to the shareholders is correct, the nature of the transaction may give rise to a fiduciary duty owed by the directors to the shareholders.Ford`s Principles of Corporate Lawsums up pithly the circumstances in which there is a fiduciary obligation to disclose:In summary, pointers towards the existence of a fiduciary obligation include shareholders` dependence upon information and advice, the existence of a relationship of confidence, the significance of some particular transaction for the parties and the extent of any positive action taken by, or on behalf of the directors to promote the transaction and the structure of shareholdings in the company:Coleman v Myers, Chan v Zacharia[1984] 154 CLR 178at 198; 53 ALR 417 per Deane J;Glavanics v Brunninghausen. Even if there is no relationship of trust and confidence, as was the case inBrunninghausen, a fiduciary relationship can still exist between a director and shareholder where the director occupies a position of particular advantage in relation to  the shareholder and special circumstances, such as confidential negotiations to sell the company`s business, allow the director to use that advantage to the detriment of the shareholder:Brunninghausen v Glanavics.MisrepresentationAs to misrepresentation by the defendant, the law envisages the representation made to be one of fact and not just an expression of opinion. However, any opinion or belief must be shown to be expressed upon reasonable grounds. If it can be shown that a defendant possessing knowledge did not express his opinion honestly such expression of an opinion can amount to a misrepresentation for which relief lies. Thus inSmith v Land & House Property Corp[1884] 28 Ch D 7at 15, per Bowen LJ stated:It is often fallaciously assumed that a statement of opinion cannot involve the statement of a fact. In a case where the fa are equally well known to both parties, what one of them says to the other is frequently nothing but an expression of opinion ... But if the facts are not equally well known to both sides, then a statement of opinion by the one who knows the facts best involves very often a statement of a material fact, for he impliedly states that he knows facts which justify his opinion.Similarly, an opinion stated as a fact where for instance a company publish as a forecast of an expert as if it was a positive fact then such publication constitutes a representation.However, a misrepresentation is considered to be harmless if amongst other things, if a plaintiff did not allow it to affect his judgment. InJEB Fasteners Ltd v Marks Bloom & Co[1983] 1 All ER 583the plaintiffs who were negotiating to acquire a company were given inaccurate company accounts. The accounts were considered by the plaintiffs but did not in any material degree affect their judgment in deciding whether or not to acquire the company. The Court of Appeal held that on the facts the plaintiffs were not entitled to any relief. If a plaintiff equates an opinion as a statement of fact constituting a misrepresentation then the plaintiff must show that he reasonably relied on it and induced the plaintiff to act as he did.",
        "Law and fact": "MisrepresentationI shall take the first and second plaintiffs` second submission - that of misrepresentation first. The misrepresentation pleaded and alleged by the first plaintiff in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief in paras 40 and 44 (1PAEC) and reiterated in evidence was that the defendant had stated:(i) that for the year 1998 the Chosen Group was not doing well;(ii) that profits of the aforesaid companies for 1998 would fall.Briefly, the first plaintiff`s evidence as contained in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief was that in February 1998 when the first and second plaintiffs, Yeh and the defendant met to finalise the valuation of the Chosen Group (excluding Chosen Investments, Chosen Shanghai & Performance Plastic Sdn  Bhd because they were not making money) at $12,000,000 they had not taken into account theprospectiveprofits for the year 1998 because the defendant had told the others that Chosen Plastics and its related companies were not doing well and that their profit would fall. The first plaintiff testified the annual report of Chosen Plastics and its related companies (Exh. 3AB 771) subsequently showed a profit for the year ending June 1998 to be $4,579,868. This profit had not been considered in the valuation reached between the parties because the defendant had said 1998 was not profitable. Had he known of the potential for such profits he would not have agreed to the $12,000,000 valuation and would have negotiated further.The defendant`s evidence, on the other hand, in cross-examination was that the statement attributed to him about the Chosen Group not doing well was made in about December 1997 in the midst of the Asian crisis and as an expression of opinion then, whilst the first and second plaintiffs were now looking at the account books with hindsight. He said he was being cautious. As far as the second allegation that profits for 1998 would fall, he had not made such a statement and that the first and second plaintiffs knew between July 1997 and November 1997 that four companies in the group had been doing well i.e. three in Singapore and Malaysia and that Newtech was doing particularly well in the same business. He had never induced them to sell their shares nor were they induced as such.I noticed that whilst the first plaintiff alleged that the defendant had said that Chosen Plastics group was not doing well for 1998 and the profits for 1998 would fall, the second plaintiff`s evidence was that:defendant said crisis would affect results [NE 34].The first plaintiff himself was asked and answered:Q: Assuming it was made the defendant`s view was being expressed cautiously since it was difficult to predict profits ahead?A: Yes.I found that no accurate statement was recalled as to what words were exactly used by the defendant. In any event, I accepted the evidence of the defendant that he was apprehensive and was expressing a concern and a fair opinion in December 1997 about a possible lower earning for the year ended 1998 in view of the Asian crisis which was then getting worse and because they had only one client Hewlett Packard with whom the contra were all for a duration of a short period of three months each time. Hewlett Packard could reduce contra and dictate prices after giving a brief notice. I also accept the defendant`s evidence that the defendant did not say that for 1998 profits would be lower. The first plaintiff was recalling from memory what the defendant told him three years earlier. I also found the first plaintiff varied his evidence a number of times thereby affecting his credibility. For example, concerning the negotiations for sale of the shares, having said in his pleadings the negotiations started in September 1997, in court he changed the month to October 1997. In another part of his evidence he stated that negotiations had started in February 1998. When questioned again whether they had not started in September 1997, he said he meant `final` negotiations were in February 1998 although the word `final` had not been used by him earlier. When  asked by the court when was the meeting to sell the shares he had simply replied `February 1998`.In any event, I was satisfied that even assuming the statements as alleged by the first plaintiff and attributed to the defendant were made and the statements amounted to misrepresentations (which though I found they were not) they did not induce the first plaintiff or the second plaintiffs to sell their shares to the defendant. This is because the first plaintiff admitted so himself in his cross-examination:Q: Are paras 40 and 44 [1PAEC] your only evidence in regard to your alleged misrepresentation?A: Yes.Q: Assuming such a statement was made - that statement did not make you sell your shares?A: Yes. Not because of statements defendant made in paras 40 and 44.I agreed with defence counsel that in the circumstances there was no evidence that the plaintiffs were induced by any such representations to sell their shares to him. The first plaintiff`s judgment was unaffected by the statements if made. The said plaintiffs also could not have relied on any such statements because they were experienced businessmen and had access to all the information concerning the companies.There is one other allegation of the first plaintiff which I propose to deal under the heading of misrepresentation as a matter of convenience although not pleaded under such a heading but raised in the first plaintiff`s affidavit of evidence-in-chief and testimony in court. According to the first plaintiff`s oral testimony, he had been told in `1997` on `two` or `three` occasions when he asked the defendant whether `we can consider listing` (Chosen Plastics) the defendant had replied it was `not possible`. Questioned incross-examinationthat the defendant had told him `it was difficult` and not `not possible`, his reply was `I cannot remember`. Although the first plaintiff orally recalled in court that he was told the above on two or three occasions in 1997, in his Affidavit, however, he had not recalled how many times he was told. In his interrogatories, however, he had answered it was once in early 1997. In court, he said it was in September 1997. With the first plaintiff contradicting his evidence I was satisfied on the consistent and unblemished evidence of the defendant that the first plaintiff had queried him only once and that too in early March 1997 when he told him it `was difficult` to list Chosen Plastics because of the dependency of the Chosen Group on one customer, a view which OUB shared. The defendant was expressing his opinion and made no wilful misrepresentation to the first plaintiff as such.",
        "Fiduciary duty/special circumstances": "I now come to the first issue canvassed on behalf of the plaintiffs, that of fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiffs by the defendant as alleged by the plaintiffs and its breach, if any, by him or the presence of special circumstances or relationship obliging the defendant to make the material disclosure.I would point out at the outset that the existence of a fiduciary duty and the obligations it entails under it differ widely and will largely be dependent on the  circumstances of the particular case, ie a situation specific approach has to be adopted to determine its existence. The issue therefore must be seen and understood and analysed against the working relationship and background of the plaintiffs and the defendant in the Chosen Group together and the reasons for the divestment by the plaintiffs of their shares to the defendant.There was as was in the case ofGlavanics v Brunninghausenno relationship of confidence and trust between the plaintiffs and the defendant. It was purely a business relationship. The first and second plaintiffs seldom met socially or went out together.So what then were the factors inherent in the case that gave rise to a fiduciary relationship between the plaintiffs and the defendant, if any? I could discern none. Unlike inGlavanics v Brunninghausenwhere there were only two shareholders, (the plaintiff and the defendant) the judge could not differentiate the duty owed to the company and the shareholders as such there, in the present case apart from the defendant there were other shareholders in Chosen Plastics and the related companies. One of the more important considerations of establishing a fiduciary relationship between a director and at that a managing director, buying shares from shareholders (here the first and second plaintiffs) is to show that such a director misled them on the share price at which the shares were sold thereby depriving them of a higher price and/or misled them on some relevant fact which if disclosed to them would have resulted in their not selling the shares at all as they were completely dependent on the said director for information.The facts of the instant case clearly show that the first and second plaintiffs were not dependent on the defendant for information concerning either the performance of the Chosen Group or its valuation. The plaintiffs themselves were active directors of the companies and suffered from no disadvantage. They conceded that they could get any information on the said companies as directors and the defendant had never refused to give them any information they wanted. They had all the relevant accounts as at the end of December 1999.The plaintiffs as directors of the Chosen Group had themselves been involved in the decision making process of the Chosen Group through passing resolutions, signing cheques and annual reports. The plaintiffs had put in initially $40,000 and $10,000 as investment in Chosen Plastics and ploughed profits back into the company and it grew. They eventually volunteered to sell all their shareholdings to the defendant devoid of any persuasion by the defendant. The first plaintiff admitted in hiscross-examinationthat he and the defendant met together to discuss business sometimes and at other times the defendant met with the second plaintiff and also with Yeh two or three times a year [NE 20]. The first plaintiff further admitted that management business plans were discussed with him and the second plaintiff and that the defendant also discussed all expansion plans involving raising and expenditure of money with him. The first plaintiff and the second plaintiffs were also co-signatories of cheques of Chosen Plastics and some of the related companies and signatories of annual reports of both Chosen Plastics and Chosen Malaysia. It was the second plaintiff who co-signed Chosen Plastics a cheque returning $2.1m loan moneys to the defendant upon completion of the sale and purchase of the shares in question. The second plaintiff was also  Chosen Plastics` Secretary from 1986 to 1998 and resolutions of Chosen Plastics were signed by either one or both plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had also stood as personal guarantors to loans taken by Chosen Plastics part of which were used to fund the business in Shanghai.It was plain to me from all these facts which were not in dispute that both plaintiffs had taken an active and informed interest in the Chosen Group. They were businessmen of long standing. They were actively pursuing at the same time other businesses they owned and they knew or must have known how the business of the Chosen Group was being run and what the revenues and profits were. I would also like to mention that the first plaintiff was also running a significant and successful separate business in Hiashya Machinery which sold injection moulding machinery and had sold many dozens of such machines each costing in the region of about $50,000 or more to the Chosen Group and was or had been a director in half a dozen other companies and that he had as late as 1995/6 gone on to start another business in China. The second plaintiff had been or was a shareholder and or director in also about half a dozen other companies.Then again the defendant had no hand in the plaintiffs wanting to sell their shares to him. That the first plaintiff volunteered to sell all his shares in Chosen Plastics and its related companies is admitted to in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief after disagreeing with the defendant about his policy and plans to expand in China and articulating his lack of confidence about making it good there. Importantly, the first plaintiff`s challenging words to the defendant were thatif he was so confident then he should take over the company and further responded that things could be discussed when the defendant told him that he did not have enough money to buy over the company. The first plaintiff in his cross-examination also admitted that he the first plaintiff thereafter approached the defendant to sell him his shares. The second plaintiff and Yeh had joined in to sell their shareholdings as the trio were in close touch with each other. Yeh no doubt wanted to sell out after he was unhappy because he wanted a personal loan from Chosen Plastics of $500,000 from its retained earnings. This request had been rightly rejected by the defendant. As for the second plaintiff, he had expressed his own reasons for selling his shareholdings to the defendant, namely, that he had lost track of the company`s business, that it was growing too fast and he could not keep track of it and he was afraid of the indirect liability for the Shanghai operations when the first phase of the expansion in Shanghai was implemented. The first and second plaintiffs were aware at all times that the Chosen Group as a whole were still making good money at the end of 1997. Results for the financial years of 1996 and 1997 of Chosen Plastics show a profit of $2,004,814 and $2,583,354. The letter account was co-signed by the second plaintiff. The unaudited balance sheet of Chosen Malaysia given to the defendant at the end of December 1997 and standing as at 31 December 1997 showed an accumulative profit of RM5,364,714.60.In the circumstances, I agreed with defendant`s counsel`s submission and came to the conclusion that the first and second plaintiffs were eager to sell out and hold cash and had voluntarily offered to sell their shares to the defendant in September 1997 which offer he accepted as they were apprehensive about the defendant`s intended expansion of the Chosen Group in Shanghai China because  as guarantors to bank loans to Chosen Plastic in Singapore which in turn was financing the Shanghai operations they felt exposed. After September to early March 2000 the parties were only concerned with accepting a valuation of the Chosen Group (save for the loss making companies as explained by the first plaintiff and stated earlier) and the purchase price of the shares to be paid by the defendant. All this was settled on 14 March 2000 by the two written agreements.I was further satisfied that the plaintiffs and Yeh had prolonged discussions from September 1997 to early March 2000 on what the valuation should be as they regularly consulted Yeh on the valuation even to the extent of going to meet him in Taiwan. The first plaintiff in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief said that Yeh had felt the valuation was in the region of $20,000,000. Eventually, Yeh had come to Singapore in March and the plaintiffs and Yeh finalised the price at $12,000,000 as the defendant was not prepared to value Chosen Plastics and the related companies higher. The defendant had taken into consideration and quite rightly too that he was buying the shares during the economic crisis of which I took judicial notice, when most businesses felt uncertainty; that he was going to pay for the shares in cash with bank borrowings on which he had to pay interest; that quoted shares were illiquid and were always sold at a discount and the book value of a company may not always be realised on an asset sale. I bore in mind that the plaintiffs and Yeh had also decided not to buy out the defendant at the same valuation.I may add that although the plaintiffs denied that the Asian crisis was a cause of their selling off their shares, it was a reasonable inference from all the evidence that the crisis in all probability also weighed on their minds and I drew such an inference. I was satisfied that the plaintiffs therefore did not want to take these risks and preferred to cash out with the considerable profit they were sitting on, namely, the first plaintiff on some $3.6m and the second plaintiff on some $1.3m and they did cash out after signing the two Agreements in March 1998 by agreeing to value the company at $12,000,000. Moreover, the first plaintiff cannot complain about the above valuation because he himself admittedthat at that time it was a good price(NE 14). The first plaintiff`s financial input into the Chosen Group had been about $40,000 and the second plaintiff`s about $10,000 some 15 years earlier.I now come to the first and second plaintiffs` main complaint that the defendant did not tell them that, he was making enquiries or conducting negotiations to publicly list the Chosen Plastics and its related companies on the SES and they would not have entered the written agreements and sold to the defendant their shares had he divulged this information to them and that as such he breached his fiduciary duty to them as a director. The defendant did not dispute that from December onwards he had started to inquire from OUB Bank and Henry Tan on the possibility of the Chosen Group going public by listing them on the stock exchange and that he did not disclosure this information to the plaintiffs. He believed he did not have to. He had explained why.I am of the opinion that the defendant was not under a duty to so inform the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs had already indicated to the defendant that they wanted to divest themselves from the Chosen Group and sell their shares to him specifically  because of a fear of potential future losses by the Shanghai branch of the Chosen Group. The defendant had already announced his plans to them that he wanted to expand in Shanghai. They had refused and wanted instead to sell all their holdings off. They had no confidence in his judgment. The defendant was, to my mind, entitled to buy the shares from the plaintiffs which they wanted to sell to him and make future plans immediately by attempting to raise funds in any manner he thought fit including from the public by a public listing of the Chosen Group through the newly incorporated vehicle Chosen Holdings so as to provide for the future of the Chosen Group and to raise a loan to pay for the shares he was buying from the defendant.It is pertinent to note that during this period all the defendant had done was to consult with OUB (and DBS) about the possibility of listing his company to raise funds for expansion in China. Both OUB and DBS banks had given him a Mandate letter dated 6th January 1998 to sign. Any of the letters if signed would have given a Mandate to the selected bank to act for the Chosen Group to manage and procure the IPO. The defendant had only been told that a listing was possible. The defendant had left it `at that`. He had not signed on and returned the Mandate letter to either bank as the application of his loan to pay for the shares was facing difficulties. Eventually, he only signed the letter of Mandate in June 1998 in OUB`s favour when they agreed to give him a personal loan to help him pay for the shares bought from the first and second plaintiffs and Yeh. The approval for the loan had come only on 10th June 1998. Until then everything was uncertain and it was only after that, that OUB went ahead processing the application for a public listing. All this took place well after 14t March 1998 when the two agreements were signed formalising the sale of the shares of the plaintiffs to the defendant.I found the defendant had pursued the possibility of listing the Chosen Group only after the plaintiffs had rebuffed his plans to expand the business operations in China by cutting off more funds going from Singapore to Shanghai and by offering to sell all their shares to the defendant which offer he had orally accepted pending settlement of the price to be paid for the shares. If I understood the first and second plaintiffs` contention rightly, it was this. With hindsight of over a year after the public listing of Chosen Holdings the plaintiffs were saying the defendant should have disclosed hisfutureplans for the Chosen Group after they had orally agreed with him to withdraw from the said companies but before the two agreements were signed on 14 March 2000 so that they would have had the opportunity to change their minds about selling him the shares. I have said earlier that all the defendant had done was to make inquiries about listing up to the time when the two agreements to sell the shares were signed between the respective parties. There was as far as I could see, no duty imposed by the law on the defendant to so disclose hisfutureplans for the Chosen Group which were only then conceptual and premature and which even if initiated may eventually have turned out to be abortive.Finally, the law recognises that a shareholder is entitled to act in his own interests. InPender v Lushington[1877] 6 Ch D 70where the plaintiffs were registered shareholders and entitled to vote but their votes were rejected on the  ground that their purpose in acquiring the shares was to vote for an improper motive, Jessel MR said:... in all cases of this kind where men exercise their rights for some motive adequate or inadequate, and I have always considered the law to be that those who have the rights of property are entitled to exercise them whatever their motive may be for such exercise.The learned judge went on to hold that a shareholder has a right, if he thinks fit, to give his vote from motives or promptings of what he considers his own individual interests. By parity of reasoning, I am therefore of the opinion that the defendant as a shareholder was entitled to consider his own interests as well. I hold on the facts found that there was neither a fiduciary relationship between him and the plaintiffs nor were there any special or exceptional circumstances warranting the defendant to make the disclosure the plaintiffs complained of as not being made. I further found that no issue therefore arose of any applicable relief being available to the plaintiffs. The defendant as a director had not acted unfairly or improperly in his relations with the plaintiffs in the divestment of the shares in question by them.The plaintiffs having therefore failed to prove their case on a balance of probabilities, I dismissed the same with costs to be taxed or agreed.Outcome:Plaintiffs` claim dismissed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
