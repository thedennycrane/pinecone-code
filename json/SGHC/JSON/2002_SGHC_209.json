        "(a) The lack of corroborative support for Sommai’s evidence": "16        The trial judge was well\n\naware of her reliance on Sommai’s testimony in convicting Tan. She also noted the\n\nweakness of Tan’s own testimony, including her demeanour in court and the internal\n\nand external inconsistencies in her evidence. In contrast, Sommai was able to testify in\n\ndetail about Tan’s business, and as to activities outside the Port with regard to\n\nTan’s business.17        With respect to Tan’s\n\nbusiness Sommai knew:(a)    that Tan had a lorry, and had many workers comprising Thais,\n\n    Malaysians, PRC nationals and Indians;(b)    that Tan’s children helped in the business;(c)    the types of activities that took place at Tan’s stalls,\n\n    such as delivering ice and seafood to customers, and weighing seafood; and(d)    that there were regular customers who came to collect ice from\n\n    Tan.18        With respect to Tan’s\n\nbusiness activities outside the Port, Sommai knew that:(a)    Tan had an office outside but near the Port;(b)    she provided accommodation for her workers near her office;(c)    the office had two female staff; and(d)    she paid her workers in cash.19        It is worth quoting the\n\ntrial judge’s opinion on the strength of Sommai’s testimony at some length:If Sommai was not Tan’s employee, had never been to\n\n    her office, did not stay at Tan’s lodgings, was not paid wages by her, and had never\n\n    been transported in her company lorry, how would he have known all these [sic], since he\n\n    was allegedly assisting Tan only at the Port, and only to transport seafood from the boats\n\n    to Tan’s stalls? Sommai would not have been able to observe these details of\n\n    Tan’s business, especially those outside the Port, given his allegedly limited scope\n\n    of work at a limited place. Moreover he could not have obtained these information [sic]\n\n    from Tan, her children or her workers, since allegedly, none of them could or did speak to\n\n    him as testified by defence witnesses.As such, I concluded that Sommai would only have known of all the above\n\n    only because he had been employed by Tan to work at her stalls, had been paid by her in\n\n    cash every month, had been to her office and had been provided lodgings by her.20        As for Tan’s\n\ncontention that Sommai’s evidence required corroborative support, this was clearly\n\nnot a situation where witness testimony needed to be corroborated. Section 136 of the\n\nEvidence Act excludes any multiplicity of witnesses requirement. Quite apart from that,\n\nthere was no reason why Sommai should be treated as a witness unworthy of credit or with\n\nan interest to serve since he had already been convicted of the offences he was charged\n\nwith, especially in the light of the trial judge’s findings of fact as to his\n\ncredibility: seeChua Keem Long v PP[1996] 1 SLR 510. In this regard it is\n\npertinent to bear in mind the Court of Appeal’s observation inAbdul Ra’uf\n\nbin Abdul Rahman v PP[2000] 1 SLR 683, applyingLim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713:An appellate court will not disturb findings of fact unless they are\n\n    clearly reached against the weight of the evidence. In examining the evidence, an\n\n    appellate court has always to bear in mind that it has neither seen nor heard the\n\n    witnesses and has to pay due regard to the trial judges’ findings and their reasons\n\n    therefor.In light of the trial judge’s reasoning and the relevant case law,\n\nI saw no reason to disturb her finding of fact on this issue.",
        "(b) The nature of Tan’s payments to Peter": "21        The dispute at trial and\n\non appeal was whether the payments of $580 per month per worker (totalling $1,740 per\n\nmonth) from February to May 2001 were the workers’ salaries or commissions payable to\n\nPeter for introducing the Thai workers to Tan. If they were the former, then it was Peter\n\nwho employed them. If the latter, they were Tan’s workers.22        The trial judge found that\n\nthey were commissions payable to Peter. Her reasoning was that it was not unbelievable\n\nthat Tan could have expended $1,300-1,400 per month on Sommai (inclusive of the\n\ncommission), given that she paid her Malaysian and Singaporean workers $1,400-1,500 each\n\n(not including workers’ levies). She found that there was no ‘sub-contract’\n\nbetween Tan and Peter for Sommai’s employment as Tan contended.23        She reached her conclusion\n\nbased on a comparison of the rates at which all of Tan’s workers were paid, and the\n\nscope of the duties they had to perform at Tan’s stalls. I could not fault the trial\n\njudge’s reasoning on this issue. Therefore, I saw no basis for me to disturb the\n\ntrial judge’s findings of fact.",
        "(c) Whether Tan had the requisite": "mens reafor conviction24        Tan would have had a\n\ndefence to the charge had she been able to show that she had fulfilled the due diligence\n\nrequirements set out in section 57(10)(b) of the Act. At trial, Tan gave evidence that her\n\nilliteracy and inability to read or understand English hindered her from making a\n\nphotocopy of Sommai’s passport and work permit. The trial judge found, and rightly\n\nso, that Tan was using illiteracy as an excuse, and that, moreover, she was lying with\n\nrespect to her inability to understand English. If anything, her illiteracy ought to have\n\ncompelled her to be more careful, retaining a photocopy of Sommai’s passport and work\n\npermit for future verification since ‘the employer’s task of checking the\n\nidentification papers of his foreign workers remains a non-delegable one. An employer who\n\nfails to comply with s 57(10) does so at his own peril’: seeCheong Choon Bin v PP[2001] 4 SLR 190.25        Furthermore, it is not at\n\nall clear from the Notes of Evidence that Sommai testified that Tan was looking athispassport, as counsel contended in the proceedings below. Sommai testified from the outset\n\nthat his passport had been taken away before he entered Singapore. He also testified that\n\nTan had looked atthepassport, not at what was purportedly his passport. One might\n\ninfer from the context of this question in the cross-examination that Tan might have been\n\nlooking at a forged document provided by Peter, but the basis for such an inference is\n\ntenuous at best.26        Finally, the trial judge\n\nconcluded, based on the internal inconsistencies within Tan’s own testimony, that she\n\nhad never insisted on looking at Sommai’s passport and work permit and had never\n\nchecked them, either personally or through her son as she claimed.Conclusion27        In the main, the essence\n\nof this appeal was to dispute the trial judge’s findings of fact, which, as I have\n\nobserved, the appellate court will not disturb unless they were ‘clearly reached\n\nagainst the weight of the evidence.’ I did not find this to be the case in the\n\npremises, especially given the trial judge’s careful observations on the demeanour of\n\nthe witnesses in the proceedings below.28        For the foregoing reasons,\n\nI dismissed the appeal against conviction and upheld the sentence of 12 months’\n\nimprisonment.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
