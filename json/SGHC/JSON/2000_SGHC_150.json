        "The hearing on 13 April": "10. Counsel for the appellant informed Justice Judith Prakash that the parties\n\nhad received the grounds of decision the previous day, and that the appellant intended to amend her\n\nNotice of Appeal. The hearing was adjourned to give time to counsel to prepare and submit their\n\ncases.The application to amend the Notice of Appeal11. The application was filed to amend prayer 3 to readThere be adivision of Dell stocksin the Non-Statutory Stocks Option\n\n  agreementswhich have vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondentand which have yet\n\n  to be vested in the Respondent.(Emphasis added)12. Three matters caught my attention on reading the application(i) counsel took more than 3 weeks to file the application after informing\n\n  Justice Prakash of the intention to amend,(ii) the appellant was claiming a division of shares the respondent did not\n\n  possess, and(iii) the appellant was not claiming a division of the unexercised vested\n\n  options or their value.",
        "The nature of the application": "13. Counsel for the appellant characterised the application as an amendment.\n\nInsofar as it sought to add a head of appeal to the notice, it can be said that it was an\n\napplication to amend the notice.14. However, it is more than an amendment. The appellant wanted to pursue in the\n\nappeal her claim for a division of the shares that the respondent would acquire if he exercised the\n\nvested options. As she had not appealed against that part of the district judges decision and the\n\ntime for appealing against it had expired, she was also seeking to appeal against that part of the\n\ndecision out of time.",
        "The rules to be applied": "15. What rules should apply to the application? I am of the view that the\n\nappellant must satisfy not only the rules for amendments, she must also satisfy the rules for\n\nextending time to file notices of appeal out of time.16. The law governing applications to extend time for filing notices of appeal\n\nwas set out by Chan Sek Keong JC (as he then was) inHau Khee Wee & Anor v Chua Kian Tong\n\n& Anor[1986] SLR 484@ 488 when he saidThe factors to be taken into account in deciding whether to grant an extension\n\n  of time to file a notice of appeal are:(1) the length of the delay;(2) the reasons for the delay;(3) the chances of the appeal succeeding if time for appealing is extended; and(4) the degree of prejudice to the would be respondent if the application is\n\n  granted.17. These factors were referred to and approved by the Court of Appeal inPearson\n\nv Chen Chien Wen Edwin[1991] 1 SLR 212where Chief Justice Yong Pung How stated \"(i)n\n\nparticular, the chances of the appeal succeeding should be considered, as it would be a waste of\n\ntime for all concerned if time is extended when the appeal is utterly hopeless\".18. The application before the Court of Appeal was for an extension of time to\n\nfile an appeal against an order on the division of matrimonial assets following the dissolution of a\n\nmarriage. The appellant was aggrieved that she was not awarded $160,000 that she has received under\n\na deed of reconciliation, but did not file her appeal in time. The Court dismissed her application\n\nfor an extension of time to file it because she had repudiated the deed when the respondent applied\n\nto court in earlier proceedings for it to be approved. The Court disapproved of her inconsistency\n\nand added that when a party applies to the court for an extension of time, the application should be\n\non grounds sufficient to persuade the court to show sympathy to him.Consideration of the factors19.The length of the delayThe judgment was delivered on 20 January. The appellant had 14 days to appeal, so\n\ntime ran out on 3 February. She did not apply to add the new head of appeal till 9 May, more than\n\nthree months later. By any standard, this was a long delay.20.The reasons for the delayThe only reasons disclosed in the appellants affidavit in support of her\n\napplication were(iii) when the notice of appeal was filed on 1stFebruary 2000, itwas based strictly on the orders made by the learned district judge (\"LDJ\").\n\n    In lodging the appeal, my previous solicitors merely based the appeal on the orders made without\n\n    having the benefit of the grounds or basis upon which the LDJ gave her orders.(iv) the actual grounds were only given one day before the firsthearing proper and it was only thereafter (i.e. way after the filing of the\n\n    notice of appeal) that my present solicitors discovered the LDJ did not take into consideration\n\n    at all the arguments made before her regarding the vested but unexercised stock options21. There was little merit in these reasons. It was very clear from the district\n\njudges orders without reference to the grounds of decision that there was to be no division of\n\nshares in respect of the unexercised vested options. When the current solicitors were appointed,\n\nthat should also be clear to them, and it must also be clear to them there was no appeal relating to\n\nthose options in the Notice of Appeal. It is noteworthy that neither set of solicitors deposed any\n\naffidavit to explain the delay. Furthermore there was no explanation for the delay in filing the\n\napplication to amend till 9 May, more than three weeks after counsel informed Justice Prakash about\n\nit.22.The chances of the appeal succeedingThe appellant is claiming a share of Dell stocks in the vested options which have\n\nnot been exercised. The basis of the claim appears to me to be flawed. Stock options are not shares.\n\nThey are rights to acquire shares. Only when an option holder exercises an option and complies with\n\nthe terms of the exercise will shares be issued to him. As long as an option remains unexercised,\n\nthe holder does not receive any shares.23. In the Appellants Case filed it was contended in respect of the unvested\n\noptions that33. On a proper construction of the relevant provisions of the Stock Option\n\n  agreements, the options were awarded to the husband at the date of each agreement albeit they were\n\n  only to vest at a future (specified) date. The husband had therefore, from the date of each\n\n  agreement, the right to have the options vested in him, which right can be deemed a chose in\n\n  action and therefore would comprise assets of the husband.34. According toHalsburys Laws (4thEd reissue) Vol 6\n\n  paragraph 1, the expression \"chose in action\" is \"used to describe all\n\n  personal rights of property which can only be claimed or enforced by action, and not by taking\n\n  physical possession.\"24. It is arguable whether an unvested option is a chose in action inasmuch as\n\nthe respondent may not have the right to have it vested. However, assuming that an unvested option\n\nis a chose in action, a vested option is also that - a chose in action, not shares. The appellants\n\nchances of success are low even if the amendment were allowed.25.The degree of prejudice to the respondentNeither the respondent nor his counsel has asserted that he would be prejudiced\n\nif the application were granted.",
        "My decision": "26. The appellants application to amend the Notice of Appeal was filed very late, without\n\nacceptable reasons for the delay. This can weigh heavily against her. InStansfield Business\n\nInternational Pte Ltd (t/a Stansfield School of Business) vVithya Sri Sumathis[1999] 3 SLR 239, Justice Chao Hick Tin (as he then was) found the failure of a solicitor to instruct his\n\nclerk to serve a notice of appeal immediately after it was filed, and the clerks delay in filing\n\nit were not sufficient grounds to warrant the exercise of his discretion to extend time for the\n\nservice of the notice by seven days, although he was of the view that there were merits in the\n\nappeal.27. The appellants delay is long, unmitigated, and repeated in that after\n\nbeing slow to realise that the Notice of Appeal needed to be amended, she was slow in making the\n\napplication to amend. She also faces the difficulty of seeking a division of shares the respondent\n\ndid not possess.28. Looking at all the circumstances, I found that the appellant has not\n\npresented a sufficient case for me to exercise my discretion in her favour to allow her to amend the\n\nNotice of Appeal.",
