        "Childrens education": "8.    I refer to para 5 of the Grounds of Decision (GD) of\n\nthe District Judge:There had been umpteen applications for access since 1997 and the\n\n  parties had resorted to communicating with each other through their lawyers on every small issue\n\n  concerning the children. It can be gleaned through their numerous affidavits that their\n\n  relationship was highly contentious and acrimonious. I could not foresee the parents cooperating\n\n  with each other on the education and religion of the children. Furthermore I was of the view that\n\n  (sic) children were old enough to voice their own views on such matters and if the wife was\n\n  to force her views on the children, they could inform their father who could then make the\n\n  necessary application to court . With regard to education, the children are already attending\n\n  schools. In all fairness, the husband has not accused the wife of being incapable of raising the\n\n  children. In fact he consented to her having care and control of them. I was of the view that it\n\n  would be detrimental to the welfare of the children if I made an order that the husbands\n\n  consent be obtained on matters of religion and education in view of their acrimonious\n\n  relationship.9.    I have considered the many affidavits filed by the\n\nrespective parties. The acrimony between the parties is clear.10.    In my view, it is unrealistic to compel the Wife to consult\n\nand seek the prior consent of the Husband on the childrens education. That would be a recipe for\n\ndisaster.11.    As the Husband has consented to the Wife having care and\n\ncontrol of the children, he should not qualify his consent by imposing the condition which is the\n\nsubject of his appeal before me. Much as he loves the children, he should come to terms with the\n\nsituation.",
        "Maintenance": "12.    Section 69(4) of the Womens Charter (Cap 353) 1997\n\nEdition requires the court to have regard to all the circumstances of the case when ordering\n\nmaintenance for a wife or child including various factors listed as (a) to (h) under sub-section\n\n(4).13.    The Wifes job history is as follows:Description of JobRemuneration per monthDuration of Employment(a)Private Banker with Citibank$3,000 (1983)1983  1989N.A.$5,000 (1984)(b)Private Banker with the Royal Bank of Canada(The Wife alleged that she $12,000 resigned to follow the Husband to Tokyo at his request.\n\n          The Husband said she resigned because she was having problems with an ex-boss. The reason\n\n          for the Wifes resignation is not material to me.)Started with $11,000 and then increased to1990  1991(c)Regional Treasurer with Carnaud Metal Box (Pte) Ltd (the name was described\n\n          differently and the spelling was different between paras 74 and 85 of the Wifes AEIC)(The Wife resigned at end 1993 presumably to look after 3 children)$13,0001993(d)Private Client Advisor with Kim Eng Securities (Pte) Ltd$4,000 (basic salary excluding bonus)19/8/96 and still continuing.14.    The Wife said she received $13,000 per month from the\n\nHusband when she resigned from her job with Royal Bank of Canada. This was for six months and the\n\nHusband was to continue paying for family and household expenses. The Husband said the $13,000 per\n\nmonth was to include the family and household expenses and the Wife was supposed to look for a job.15.    It is immaterial to me whether the $13,000 per month was to\n\ninclude or exclude family and household expenses. It was obviously given to the Wife because she had\n\nresigned from her job. She had also accompanied the Husband to Tokyo. It was a special situation\n\nthen.16.    As can be seen from the Wifes job history, the Wifes\n\nearning capacity was quite great. However she alleged that all her previous jobs required her\n\nto travel on a frequent basis. Subsequently, she decided not to take a job which required her to\n\ntravel as that would mean leaving the children alone for long periods. Her present job with Kim Eng\n\nSecurities (Pte) Ltd was taken on the basis that she does not have to travel at all, hence her low\n\nincome (see para 96 of her affidavit filed on 30 August 1999).17.    However, although the Wifes current basic salary is\n\n$4,000 per month, she is entitled to receive a bonus.18.    I had asked for the Form IR8A and Notice of Assessment of\n\nthe parties for Year of Assessment (YA) 1999 and YA 2000.19.    For YA 1999, the Notice of Assessment shows the Wifes\n\nincome from employment to be $42,736. This was less than $4,000 a month but it was not explained to\n\nme why this was so.20.    For YA 2000, the Notice of Assessment shows her income from\n\nemployment to be $92,657 which was about $7,700 per month.21.    The Husband was working with IBM but stopped in about March\n\n1994. His job history from 1994 is as follows:Description of JobRemuneration per monthDuration of Employment(a)Managing Director of Quorum Growth (Singapore) Pte Ltd (Quorum) (but\n\n          subsequently instead of being paid direct, his services were rendered through CSV Holdings\n\n          Pte Ltd (CSV) so that his income from Quorum would be paid to CSV. CSV is jointly\n\n          owned by the Husband and the Wife although not in equal shares. The income from Quorum was\n\n          re-directed in January 1996 by the Husband to another company which he had incorporated\n\n          with his brother-in-law).About $36,000 (including bonus)3/94 - 5/96(b)--Unemployed6/96 - 12/96(c)Dell Computer Asia Pte Ltd (Dell Asia)(a) $24,730 (from Feb 98)(b) $27,001 (from Jul 98)(c) $28,352 (from 1/3/1999)According to affidavit evidence, the Husband worked for Dell Asia in\n\n          Singapore from 1/1/97 to March 98 and then went to work for the same company in Hong Kong.The tax return filed in Hong Kong shows that his income from Hong Kong\n\n          started from 1 October 1998.22.    The Husbands income from Dell Asia was not confined to\n\nhis basic salary. Aside from allowances, he was also entitled to receive a bonus provided targets\n\nwere met.23.    For 1998, the Notice of Assessment shows his income from\n\nemployment in Singapore was $181,405. The Form IR8A indicated that this income from Singapore ceased\n\non 30 September 1998.24.The Employers Return of\n\nRemuneration & Pensions for Hong Kong income for the year ended 31 March 1999 showed his income\n\nfor six months from 1 October 1998 to 31 March 1999, excluding various allowances, to be HK$820,438\n\n(i.e about $182,320 at an exchange rate of, say, HK$4.5 to S$1). There was nothing for bonus.25.    It is easier to consider the Employers Return for Hong\n\nKong income for one full year from 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. This was HK$1,792,829 for salary\n\nand HK$1,333,283 for bonus, i.e a total of HK$3,126,112 (or about $694,692 at the same exchange\n\nrate). This works out to $57,891, say, $58,000 per month (including bonus) or about S$33,200 per\n\nmonth (excluding bonus). Neither figure includes G & S allowance, Auto allowance and Stock\n\nPurchase discount or gains realised from stock options for the Husband.26.    At this stage, I refer to the case ofSusy Suryani\n\nSantoso v Lee Kong Eng & Alexis Khoo(Divorce 1704/98 and RAS 95 and 96/99). In that case,\n\nJustice Judith Prakash ordered that the husband pay additional maintenance based on each months\n\nbonus received by the husband if and when he was paid any bonus. Her decision on this point was\n\nreversed by the Court of Appeal but no written reasons were given.27.    I am of the view that the decision of the Court of Appeal\n\ndoes not mean that bonuses should never be taken into account on the issue of maintenance. Each case\n\nmust depend on its own particular facts and it should be borne in mind that bonuses may not be paid\n\nor, if paid, may not be for the same sum each year.28.    Prior to the District Judges order on maintenance, there\n\nwere two earlier orders for maintenance.29.    On 2 February 1998, the Wife applied for maintenance. The\n\nparties then consented to an order dated 13 February 1998 under Summons No MSS 265/1998 (the 1stMaintenance Order).30.    Under the 1stMaintenance Order, the Husband was\n\nto pay $11,000 per month for maintenance of the Wife and the three children with effect from 15\n\nFebruary 1998 and thereafter on the 15thof each month.31.    Just a few months later, the Wife applied on 25 June 1998\n\nfor an increase in the maintenance.32.    The parties again consented to an order this time dated 13\n\nAugust 1998 and made under Summons No MSS 3099/1998 (the 2ndMaintenance Order).33.    Under the 2ndMaintenance Order, the Husband was\n\nto pay $14,500 per month for maintenance of the Wife and three children with effect from 15 August\n\n1998 and thereafter on the 15thof each month.34.    However the 2ndMaintenance Order was made\n\nwithout prejudice to the ancillary issues to be dealt with in the divorce petition. The 1stMaintenance Order did not have this qualification.35.    While Counsel for each party stressed that the 2ndMaintenance Order was made without prejudice to the ancillaries, neither was too keen to say much,\n\nif anything, as to why her client had agreed to the amount of maintenance ordered under the 1stMaintenance Order. The reason for this was obvious. In the case of the Husband, he was seeking less\n\nthan what had been ordered thereunder and in the case of the Wife, she was seeking more.36.    After considering various factors, as set out in paras 15\n\nto 17 of her GD, the District Judge made an order for maintenance at $16,000 per month, as set out\n\nin para 6 above.37.    In so far as the Husband had sought to use the 1stMaintenance Order and the 2ndMaintenance Order against the Wife, he was not entitled to\n\nuse the 2ndMaintenance Order to do so as it was made without prejudice to the\n\nancillaries (even though the without prejudice qualification may have been included at his request).\n\nThe without prejudice privilege applies to both parties and Mrs Anamah Tan for the Husband did not\n\ncontend otherwise.38.    As for the 1stMaintenance Order, it can be\n\ntaken into account for or against either of the parties, and not just against the Wife.39.    It is incumbent on either party seeking less or more than\n\nwhat had been ordered under the 1stMaintenance Order to justify why a decrease or\n\nincrease should be allowed.40.    As for the Wife, her Counsel Ms Kanya submitted that when\n\nthe Wife agreed to the $11,000 per month, this was because the Husband was supposed to continue\n\npaying the utility bills, payments in respect of the matrimonial home as well as supermarket\n\nexpenses. These were paid by GIRO and when the Husband stopped the GIRO payment subsequently, the\n\nWife sought an increase in maintenance which resulted in the 2ndMaintenance Order.41.    However, this reason turned out to be untrue.42.    Under the 1stMaintenance Order, the Wife was to\n\npay for the mortgage, TAS, PUB, maintenance charges and property tax for the matrimonial home. The 1stMaintenance Order was silent about the subsequent supermarket expenses. I am of the view that it was\n\nfor the Wife to require an express stipulation if the Husband was to continue paying supermarket\n\nexpenses.43.    In any event, the Wife herself did not give the reason\n\nwhich Ms Kanya gave when the Wife sought an increase in maintenance which resulted in the 2ndMaintenance Order.44.    In the Wifes second complaint which led to the 2ndMaintenance Order, she gave the following reasons for seeking an increase to about $33,000 per\n\nmonth:2(a) That the maintenance sum of $11,000-00 is insufficient to meet the\n\n  needs of the Complainant and the children of the family.(b) That the Respondent has not fully declared his means to the Court and is\n\n  able to support the family in the sum to be varied.(c) That the Respondent has not been paying sufficient maintenance since\n\n  January 1996.45.    I am of the view that her paragraph 2(c) is not a valid\n\nreason for increasing maintenance from a consent order.46.    As for her paragraph 2(a), I do not agree that $11,000 per\n\nmonth is insufficient to meet the needs of the children and the Wife. Whether it is sufficient to\n\nenable them to live in the lifestyle they were used to is another matter.47.    The real reason for the Wife seeking an increase was her\n\nparagraph 2(b). This reason is reiterated in paras 25 to 28 of her affidavit filed on 12 August 1998\n\ni.e one day before the 2ndMaintenance Order was made.48.    Furthermore, in para 20 of her Affidavit of Evidence in\n\nChief 1stfor the Ancillary matters filed on 25 June 1999 (AEIC) the Wife said that\n\nshe was seeking maintenance of at least $33,000 per month, based on the Respondents last known\n\nincome earned in Singapore of $840,416.15 in 1997, and his last known income earned in Hong Kong,\n\nfor the period 1 April 1997 to 31 March 1998, of HK$18,735,755. This income was earned by the\n\nRespondent prior to his promotion from Vice President, Asia Direct, to President of Dell, Hong\n\nKong/China. This translates to an (sic) approximately monthly income of S$382,297.26.49.    This reinforces the point that her ground for seeking an\n\nincrease in maintenance in June 1998 and later in her AEIC for ancillaries was because she had found\n\nout more about the Husbands income.50.    The question I have to consider is whether there is some\n\nbasis for the Wife to say that she would not have agreed to $11,000 per month had the Husband not\n\nmisrepresented his income.51.    From the correspondence between solicitors and the Husbands\n\nown affidavit filed on 11 August 1998 in respect of the 2ndMaintenance Summons, it is\n\nclear to me that the Husband had said that he was earning slightly over $20,000 per month when the\n\nWife first agreed to $11,000 per month for the 1stMaintenance Order (of 13 February\n\n1998).52.    The Husband sought to explain this away by saying that he\n\nwas not asked to state the exact figure. Even so, I am of the view that he was giving a lower round\n\nfigure than he should have and he had omitted to mention his eligibility for bonus.53.    I am of the view that the Wife has established that she\n\nwould not have agreed to the $11,000 per month had the Husbands true income then been disclosed\n\nand certainly not when his income for the year 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000 (see para 25 above) is\n\nknown.54.    However, I have still to consider the alleged expenses for\n\nthe children and her.55.    For this purpose, I start with the Wifes initial claim\n\nfor maintenance which led to the 1stMaintenance Order. She had listed out various\n\nalleged expenses.56.    According to Ms Kanya and Mrs Tan, the total of the alleged\n\nexpenses amounted to $24,340.14.57.    Both Counsel then assumed that the Wife had claimed\n\nmaintenance of about $24,000 per month.58.    I noted that both Counsel had used an incomplete complaint\n\nmade by the Wife under s 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code. Item 5 of the complaint in which the\n\nWife was to state the amount of maintenance claimed was blank. Therefore I asked for a copy of the\n\ncompleted complaint to be provided to me and eventually this was done.59.    As it turned out, the completed complaint showed that the\n\nWife was then claiming $21,000 (and not $24,000) per month as maintenance for herself and the three\n\nchildren. This is quite telling because it was a claim she had made before she was misled about the\n\nHusbands income.60.In just under five months, she was subsequently alleging that her expenses,\n\nand corresponding claim for maintenance, had increased to $33,000 per month for her 2ndclaim for maintenance.61.    The Wife provided a list of alleged expenses for her 2ndclaim for maintenance. She also provided a list of such expenses in her AEIC (for ancillaries) and\n\nit is this list which I have considered. It appears to me that she had inflated her expenses in an\n\nattempt to justify her claim for $33,000 per month. Also, some of the items should not be included\n\nin a maintenance order.62.    For example, the Wife included insurance premiums for\n\npolicies she had taken out. These appeared to have a savings or investment element in them as the\n\npremiums were rather high bearing in mind the sums insured. The Wife did not deny this but\n\nconsidered it right that the Husband should pay the premiums. I do not agree. When the policies\n\nmature, the Wife or the children will have the benefits and not the Husband.63.    The Wife also claimed for monies given to her mother and\n\nfor making gifts to relatives and friends. While a court would encourage filial piety and\n\ngenerosity, this cannot be at the expense of the Husband.64.    Also, in claiming for household expenses, the Wife was\n\nclaiming for a household of seven i.e herself, the three children, a maid and her parents. She gave\n\nthe reason that her parents were helping to take care of the children but I do not accept that the\n\nparents contribution to the care of the children was to such an extent that it was right to\n\ncompel the Husband to provide for household expenses for the parents.65.    The Wife also said that the amounts paid by CSV from 1994\n\nto January 1995 would support her claim of expenses amounting to about $33,000 per month. She\n\nalleged that all payments by CSV were for such expenses. I have considered the payments made by CSV\n\nduring this period. Some of the payments for large sums were to the Husband or to the Wife for their\n\nrespective salaries. Some were for their respective credit card expenses and it was unclear what\n\nother payments to the Husband were for. Some of the other payments were also dubious, eg there were\n\npayments of $1,000 a month to Leong Kuan Swee (the Wifes father) for transport, presumably as\n\nsome sort of chauffeur, of $800 a month to Tan Cheng Poon (the Wifes mother) for tuition, and of\n\n$2,000 a month to Kam Swee Kee (the Husbands mother) for tuition. I doubt that such payments were\n\ngenuinely for chauffeur services or for tuition. They were probably to draw money out from CSV for\n\nthese relatives.66.    At this point, I would mention that the Husband sought to\n\nuse the Wifes new list of alleged expenses to his advantage. That new list had three headings:\n\n(a) Household Expenses, (b) the Wifes Expenses and (c) the Childrens Expenses. The Childrens\n\nExpenses amounted to slightly over $9,000 per month. Using this, the Husband said that $8,000 per\n\nmonth for the children was fair after taking into account some exaggeration on the part of the Wife.67.    I am of the view that the Husbands approach was not\n\ncorrect. Obviously some of the Household Expenses would also be for the account of the children.\n\nFurthermore, he himself had consented to maintenance of a total of $11,000 per month for the Wife\n\nand the children under the 1stMaintenance Order and yet was now seeking to convince the\n\ncourt that it should be $8,500 per month (ie $8,000 per month for the children and $500 per month\n\nfor the Wife).68.    Mrs Tan did not give any reason why the Husband had agreed\n\nto $11,000 per month in the first place.69.    Coming back to the Wifes appeal for an increase in\n\nmaintenance, Mrs Tan had submitted that the Wife was trying to have two bites at the cherry, first,\n\nby using the Husbands stock options to claim higher maintenance and, secondly, by claiming a\n\nshare in the Husbands stock options in the division of matrimonial assets.70.    Ms Kanya denied this. She referred to para 15 of the GD in\n\nwhich the District Judge had determined that the Husbands average monthly income was $44,281\n\nwithout taking into account his stock options or gains therefrom.71.    However, I note that in para 20 of the Wifes AEIC, the\n\ncontents of which I have cited in para 48 above, the Wife did take into account the Husbands\n\ngains from stock options when she was seeking $33,000 per month as maintenance (see also para\n\n40(2)(g) and (h) at p 32 and p 307 and 310 of the Wifes AEIC).72.    In any event, at present, the Wife is no longer seeking\n\n$33,000 per month in her appeal before me but $20,000 per month (instead of the $16,000 per month\n\nallowed by the District Judge) for the children and herself. The increase of $4,000 per month is\n\nsought for herself.73.    In the light of Ms Kanyas argument, as mentioned in para\n\n70 above, it appears that Ms Kanya is not relying on the stock options to seek the additional $4,000\n\nper month for the Wife. Accordingly, I am disregarding the stock options for the issue of\n\nmaintenance.74.    After taking into account the Wifes initial claim for\n\nmaintenance, the amount consented to under the 1stMaintenance Order and the factors I\n\nhave mentioned as well as the factors listed in s 69(4) of the Womens Charter, and using a\n\nbroad-brush approach, I am of the view that the maintenance should be $15,000 a month and that it\n\nshould be spread more evenly among the children and the Wife, ie $4,000 per month for each of the\n\nchildren and $3,000 per month for the Wife.75.    Taking into account the Wifes income, she should have\n\n$19,000 per month, even if she does not receive bonuses, for the children and herself.76.    On the part of the Husband, he will have enough for himself\n\neven if he does not receive bonuses.77.    According to paragraph 18(ii) of Mrs Tans submissions,\n\nthe Husband has left Dell Asia since October 2000. However, Mrs Tan pointed out, and I agree, that\n\nthis is not relevant because I am not dealing with an application or appeal based on a change of\n\ncircumstances.",
        "Back-dating of maintenance": "78.    The Wife has sought maintenance from February 1996 on the\n\nbasis that the Husband has not provided any maintenance since then. Accordingly, if the maintenance\n\nordered by the District Judge is increased under the Wifes appeal, the Wife is also seeking that\n\nthe increase be back-dated to start from February 1996.79.    The claim for the maintenance to be back-dated to February\n\n1996 was mentioned in an affidavit of the Wife but Mrs Tan pointed out to me that it was not pursued\n\nin the submissions on the Wifes behalf to the District Judge.80.    Furthermore, if the maintenance is reduced under the\n\nHusbands appeal, the Wifes position is that it should not be back-dated to the effective date\n\nof maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January 2000 or to the effective date of\n\nmaintenance under either the 2ndMaintenance Order or the 1stMaintenance\n\nOrder.81.    Ms Kanya even took the technical point that the Husbands\n\nNotice of Appeal did not say that any reduction should be with effect from 1 January 2000. Therefore\n\nany reduction should be from the date of my decision or thereabouts. I am of the view that this\n\nargument is a non-starter. The Husband is appealing from the decision of the District Judge and\n\nhence any order made by me to reduce maintenance should take into account the effective date of\n\nmaintenance under the District Judges order.82.    It is clear to me that the Wife is trying to have her cake\n\nand eat it.83.    In any event, I am not satisfied that the Wife has\n\nestablished that the Husband has failed to pay any maintenance between February 1996 to 15 February\n\n1998. Indeed I note from the completed complaint leading to the 1stMaintenance Order\n\nthat her allegation then was that the Husband had failed to maintain her and the three children\n\nsince January 1996 adequately as opposed to at all.84.    In the circumstances, my order on maintenance is to take\n\neffect from the effective date of maintenance under the District Judges order i.e 1 January 2000.\n\nThe 2ndMaintenance Order will cease to apply from this date.Stock Options85.    The Husband was employed by Dell Asia. From time to time he\n\nreceived agreements from Dell Computer Corporation (the Corporation), a Delaware corporation,\n\nto grant him stock options in the Corporation which he in turn had apparently agreed to.86.    The terms of each agreement are similar but not identical\n\nas I will elaborate below.87.    Under each agreement, the Husband was granted what is\n\ndescribed as a Non Statutory Stock Option to purchase a certain number of the Corporations stock.\n\nHowever the option does not vest in him immediately i.e. he cannot exercise the option immediately.88.    Portions will vest at stated periods, for example, 20% on\n\neach of the first, second, third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of the grant.89.    Once the option vests, it must be exercised before a\n\ntermination date which, for example, is ten years from the date of the grant but there may be\n\nperiods of unexercisability, to be determined by the Corporation, to avoid insider trading.90.    Should the Husband decide to exercise a vested option, he\n\nhas to give notice for the number of shares of stock being purchased with payment of the exercise\n\nprice. I was informed by both Counsel that this had been done in the past and the Husband then sold\n\nsome shares or stock and made a profit although there appears to be no obligation on him to sell\n\nthem.91.    Ms Kanya categorised the options into three categories:(a) options which have vested and which have been exercised by the Husband (the\n\n  1stcategory),(b) options which have vested but have not yet been exercised by the Husband (the\n\n  2ndcategory),(c) options which have not vested in the Husband (the 3rdcategory).92.    The District Judge granted the Wife 15% of the gains from\n\nthe 1stcategory but nothing for the 2ndand 3rdcategories.93.    The Wifes position is that as regards the 1stcategory, she should be granted 30% for her indirect contributions to the marriage as that was the\n\nDistrict Judges decision in respect of the matrimonial home.94.    As for the 2ndand 3rdcategories,\n\nthe Wifes position is that she should also be granted 30% of the value of the options, or\n\nalternatively, 15%. However, Ms Kanya accepted that the options may not vest or, even if vested, may\n\nnot be exercised by the Husband. That is why she sought an if and when order to be made rather\n\nthan ask for a value to be ascribed to the 2ndand 3rdcategories.95.    Ms Kanya also submitted that an if and when order is\n\nwithin the purview of s 112(5)(e) of the Womens Charter.96.    Section 112(5)(e) states:(5) In particular, but without limiting the generality of subsections (3)\n\n  and (4), the court may make any one or more of the following orders:(a)(b)(c)(d)(e) an order postponing the sale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial\n\n  asset, or any part of such share, until such future date of until the occurrence of such future\n\n  event or until the fulfilment of such condition as may be specified in the order;97.    In my view, s 112(5)(e) enables a court to postphone the\n\nsale or vesting of any share in any matrimonial asset which is already vested in one or both of the\n\nparties. It does not apply to the situation where the vesting of a matrimonial asset is delayed\n\nunder the terms of the agreement which allegedly gives rise to the acquisition of the asset.98.    The Amended Notice of Appeal of the Wife in respect of the\n\n2ndand 3rdcategories seeks that:3. There be a division of Dell stocks in the Non-Statutory Stocks Option\n\n  agreements whichhave vested but yet to be exercised by the Respondent and whichhave yet\n\n  to be vested in the Respondent.99.    Technically, even with the amendment, it is not appropriate\n\nto refer to a division of Dell stocks because no Dell stock has been acquired yet as regards the 2ndand 3rdcategories. However it is clear to me that this prayer was intended to refer to a\n\ndivision of the stock options under the 2ndand 3rdcategories and indeed, the\n\nsubmission of both Counsel proceeded on that basis.100.    Section 112(1) and (10) of the Womens Charter (1997 Ed)\n\nstates:Power of court to order division of matrimonial assets112. (1) The court shall have power, when granting or subsequent to the grant\n\n  of a decree of divorce, judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between\n\n  the parties of any matrimonial asset or the sale of any such asset and the division between the\n\n  parties of the proceeds of the sale of any such asset in such proportions as the court thinks just\n\n  and equitable.(10) For the purposes of this section, \"matrimonial asset\" means(a)(b) any other asset of any nature acquired during the marriage by one party\n\n    or both parties to the marriage,but does not include any asset (not being a matrimonial home) that has been\n\n  acquired by one party at any time by gift or inheritance and that has not been substantially\n\n  improved during the marriage by the other party or by both parties to that marriage.101.    Ms Kanya submitted that the 2ndand 3rdcategories are choses in action and that they come within the wide definition of any other asset\n\nof any nature.102.    She referred to Halsburys Laws of England, Fourth\n\nEdition Reissue Volume 6 at para 8 which states:8.Enumeration of choses in action.In order that a more\n\n  comprehensive idea as to the nature and extent of the expression \"chose in action\" may\n\n  be formed, it may be convenient to show in some detail what kinds of things and property have been\n\n  held to be choses in action. The following things have been held to be choses in action; they are\n\n  grouped in five divisions for purposes of convenience only.(1) Debts, whether due by specialty or by simple contract, .(2) The benefit of a contract, including  an option to purchase shares, ;\n\n  a right to be issued shares in a company .(3) Recognised subjects of property, such as stock in public funds; a share of\n\n  bank stock; shares in joint stock companies, and presumably in every kind of company, including\n\n  stock issued by national corporations; a fund in court; .(4) Equitable rights to property, such as beneficial interests under trusts .(5) Miscellaneous rights, such as a right of action arising under contract,\n\n  including a claim for unliquidated damages for breach of contract; .103.    Ms Kanya further submitted that although the Singapore\n\nHigh Court and the Court of Appeal have not in the past made any decision as to whether stock\n\noptions are matrimonial assets for the purpose of dividing them, these courts have included shares\n\nor stocks for the purpose of dividing matrimonial assets.104.    She also referred me to the American case ofBarbara\n\nGreen v Michael Green(8 July 1985, Court of Special Appeals of Maryland).105.    In that case, Karwacki J, delivering the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Special Appeals of Maryland said:InDeering v. Deering, 292 Md. 115, 437 A.2d 883 (1981), the Court of\n\n  Appeals held that a spouses pension rights, to the extent accumulated during the marriage,\n\n  constitute \"marital property\" within the meaning of The Marital Property Act. The Court\n\n  of Appeals emphasized that its holding applied to all pensions, whether vested or unvested, or\n\n  whether matured or unmatured. This Court inOhm v. Ohm, 49 Md.App. 392, 431 A.2d 1371 (1981)had earlier reached the same conclusion. The Court of Appeals in Deering noted: \"It is\n\n  significant that over the past several years, pension benefits have become an increasingly\n\n  important part of an employees compensation package which he or she brings to a marriage\n\n  unit\".292 Md.at 122, 437 A.2d 883. And in Ohm, this Court identified, through\n\n  citations to numerous cases, those jurisdictions which have held that rights under a private or\n\n  public pension plan, to the extent such rights were acquired during the marriage, are property\n\n  subject to division upon dissolution. We noted that these decisions rested upon the rationale\n\n  \"that retirement benefits are a form of deferred compensation or wage substitute and the\n\n  right to receive such benefits, being contractual in nature, is a chose in action and thus,\n\n  property\"Ohm, 49 Md.App. at 397, 431 A.2d 1371.As with pension plans, restricted stock option plans like those we consider\n\n  here are a form of employee compensation, providing to the employee the right to accept within a\n\n  prescribed time period and under certain conditions the corporate employers irrevocable offer\n\n  to sell its stock at the price quoted. If the employer attempts to withdraw that offer, the\n\n  employee has \"a chose in action\" in contract against the employer. We therefore conclude\n\n  that stock option plans, like other benefits in an employees compensation package, constitute\n\n  \"property\" as used in the definition of marital property. Furthermore, because the plans\n\n  in the case sub judice granted stock options to the appellee while he was married to the\n\n  appellant, those options were \"acquired\" during the marriage. SeeHarper v. Harper,\n\n  294 Md.54, 448 A.2d 916 (1982).The stock options are therefore marital property under the\n\n  terms of 8-201(e) and as such are subject to valuation and equitable adjustment in the form of a\n\n  monetary award, pursuant to 8-204 and 8-205.The trial court stated in its memorandum opinion that the stock options were\n\n  valueless because they had no \"fair market value\". Although it is true that an\n\n  unassignable, unsalable option has no fair market value, it is nonetheless an economic resource,\n\n  comparable to pension benefits, to which a value can be attributed. We will comment briefly upon\n\n  the method by which the trial court may value and adjust the parties equities in this form of\n\n  marital property.The appellate courts of Maryland have recognized the complexity of the task\n\n  confronting trial courts in properly valuing and allocating certain forms of marital property.Deering,\n\n  292 Md. At 129, 437 A.2d 883; Ohm, 49 Md.App. at 405-06, 431 A.2d 1371. An elastic approach to\n\n  the problem is required so as to accommodate the circumstances presented by each case.Nisos v.\n\n  Nisos, 60 Md.App. 368, 383, 483 A.2d97 (1984).As with pensions, the valuation and allocation\n\n  of stock options necessitates such a flexible approach. In completing steps 2 and 3 of the\n\n  procedure for allocating this marital property by formulating an equitable monetary award, the\n\n  court must take into consideration the nature of the appellees property right in the options.\n\n  In simple terms, the appellees property interest can be described as the right to choose\n\n  whether or not to purchase 5,000 shares of Network Systems stock on certain dates at specified\n\n  prices. Thus the court may not adopt an approach to the equitable adjustment of that property\n\n  which would operate to compel the appellee to exercise his option, since to do so would in effect\n\n  deprive him of the essence of his property interest; i.e., the right to make a choice regarding\n\n  the exercise of the options.The trial court may in its discretion, however, adopt an \"if, as and\n\n  when\" approach to the valuation and equitable allocation of the unexercised options,\n\n  including the 2,500 matured options as well as the 2,500 unmatured options. This approach has\n\n  proven to be a workable method for the allocation of unmatured pensions, seeDeering, supra,and\n\n  we believe, is equally effective in the allocation of stock options. We explain. Under the second\n\n  of the three step process for the determination of a monetary award in adjustment of this marital\n\n  property, the court must attach a value to options as of the date of the decree, seeNisos, 60\n\n  Md.App. at 381-85, 483 A.2d 97.That value may be determined by taking into consideration the\n\n  market value of shares of Network stock as of the time of that decree, and the cost to the\n\n  appellee of exercising the options. The court may, then, pursuant to the third step of the\n\n  process, determine a percentage by which the profits should be divided if, as and when the options\n\n  are exercised. Under such an approach to the equitable allocation of this marital property, the\n\n  appellee is under no compulsion to exercise his options. At the same time, however, the appellants\n\n  equitable interest in the options, if exercised, is protected. We believe this approach fairly\n\n  implements the process of adjusting the equities between the parties with respect to marital\n\n  property as mandated by the Act.For these reasons, we hold that the trial court was clearly erroneous in its\n\n  conclusion that the stock options were valueless and in failing to include them in its\n\n  determination of the marital property. We will thus remand this case in order that the court may\n\n  make appropriate findings of fact with respect to the valuation of those assets, and make such\n\n  adjustment to the monetary award as it deems equitable.106.    Mrs Tan submitted that it was arguable whether a stock\n\noption per se is in fact a chose in action.107.    She also submitted that it is not a matrimonial asset to\n\nbe divided by the court under s 112 of the Womens Charter. She said that our courts have always\n\ndivided tangible assets but she did not dispute that our courts have considered shares as\n\nmatrimonial assets.108.She sought to distinguish\n\nstock options from shares by saying that shares are tangible and already belong to someone whereas\n\nstock options in the 2ndand 3rdcategories do not yet belong to anyone.109.    She argued that there must be certainty of ownership and\n\nto include a stock option or a chose in action as a matrimonial asset would have far-reaching\n\nramifications. It will mean that a debt owing to one party would then be a matrimonial asset but\n\nthis would create a problem if the monies were not recovered.110.    She also argued that the Green case cited by Ms Kanya was\n\nnot applicable in Singapore as, first, the system of American matrimonial law differs from ours as\n\ntheirs is based on community property, and secondly, even within their country, it may differ from\n\nstate to state.111.    She further argued that the Husband had not yet acquired\n\nthe stock options under the 2ndand 3rdcategories. He acquires these stock\n\noptions only when the same are both vested and exercised by him.112.    Mrs Tans main point was that there were too many\n\nuncertainties until the options are vested and exercised by the Husband. For this argument, she\n\nreferred to various provisions in the agreements granting the stock options.113.    One provision in point is that the options are not vested\n\nimmediately upon the execution of the stock option agreements.114.    A second provision in point is that the vesting of the\n\noptions can be deferred, but not beyond a certain date which can be specified in the respective\n\nagreements.115.    A third provision in point is that the options will be\n\nterminated if the Husbands employment is terminated for serious misconduct. If it is terminated\n\nfor reasons other than serious misconduct, options in the 3rdcategory will expire then\n\nand options in the 2ndcategory will expire after a certain time.116.    A fourth provision in point is that in some (but not all)\n\nof the agreements granting the stock options, there is also a provision for the forfeiture of option\n\nproceeds. Under such a provision, certain option proceeds will have to be repaid by the Husband if\n\nhe competes with the Corporation within a certain time frame after the termination of his\n\nemployment.117.    Mrs Tan further supported her argument about\n\nnon-acquisition by referring to the definition of the word acquired in The Shorter Oxford\n\nEnglish Dictionary. It defines acquire as to gain, or get as ones own (by ones own\n\nexertions or qualities); to receive, come into possession. She argued that, By this\n\ndefinition, once an asset is acquired, it is yours period and no one can take it away from you.118.    It is not disputed that the Green case involved the\n\nconsideration of what constitutes martial property within the meaning of a different\n\nlegislation i.e. The Marital Property Act.119.However, in my view, that\n\ncase is authority for the proposition that a stock option is a chose in action. This is similar to\n\nthe position under English law as set out in Halsburys Laws of England (see para 102 above). That\n\ncase also illustrates the use of an if, as and when order. I will refer to such an order as an\n\nif and when order for simplicity.120.    I am of the view that clearly the stock options in the 2ndcategory are choses in action. As regards the stock options in the 3rdcategory, where\n\nthe options have not yet vested in the Husband, these are also choses in action. The Husband has a\n\nbenefit under a contract or contracts to have the options vested in him at some future date.121.    I am also of the view that the stock options of the 2ndand 3rdcategories come within the wide definition of matrimonial asset under s\n\n112(10)(b) of the Womens Charter i.e. any other asset of any nature. In my view, matrimonial\n\nasset is not confined to tangible assets.122.    Accordingly a debt owing to one of the spouses can be a\n\nmatrimonial asset if acquired during the marriage.123.    I do not agree with Mrs Tans argument about\n\nfar-reaching ramifications. Indeed, if she were correct, a spouse will be encouraged to lend monies\n\nto various persons when the marriage is floundering, and then claim that such debts should not be\n\ntreated as part of matrimonial assets for the purpose of s 112.124.    I am also of the view that any difficulty in establishing\n\nthe value of a matrimonial asset should not be confused with its existence.125.    The uncertainties mentioned in Mrs Tans arguments are\n\nconditions subsequent to the acquisition of the choses in action. They are not pre-conditions to the\n\nacquisition. Accordingly, the Husband has acquired the choses in action under the 2ndand\n\n3rdcategories.126.    I also do not think that it is correct to describe a share\n\nas a tangible asset but, in the circumstances, it is unnecessary for me to elaborate further on this\n\npoint.127.    As regards Mrs Tans argument that the provision for the\n\nforfeiture of option proceeds (which would apply if the Husband were to compete with the Corporation\n\nwithin a specified time frame of the termination of his employment) demonstrated non-acquisition,\n\nthis is not a valid argument. If she were correct, then even the stock options under the 1stcategory cannot be said to be acquired by the Husband if such a provision applies to those options.128.As regards Mrs Tans\n\nargument that once an asset is acquired, no one can take it away from you, this is also not a valid\n\nargument. For example, a house bought by the Husband and mortgaged to a bank can be taken away from\n\nthe Husband if he fails to pay the bank. Yet no one would say that the house has not yet been\n\nacquired by the Husband for the purpose of s 112.129.    As for the definition of acquire in The Shorter\n\nOxford Dictionary, I am of the view that it is neither here nor there.130.    Mrs Tan had one other argument. She submitted that the\n\nWife had taken all the stock options into account in determining the Husbands remuneration for\n\nthe issue of maintenance and the Wife should not be allowed to have them taken into account in the\n\ndivision of matrimonial assets. Otherwise, the Wife would be having two bites of the same cherry.131.    I have already mentioned above that Ms Kanya is not\n\nrelying on the stock options to claim additional maintenance for the Wife and I have disregarded it\n\nfor that issue.132.    I now turn to the District Judges reasons for not\n\nordering a division of the stock options in the 2ndand 3rdcategories. In\n\npara 14 of her GD, she said:14. There was no doubt that the unvested Dell stock options were part of the\n\n  husbands salary package and although they were allotted to him once in every six (6) months,\n\n  they were intrinsically tied up with his performance in the company. Furthermore if his employment\n\n  were to be terminated with just cause, he would lose all the vested stock options, which he had\n\n  exercised. InSusy Suryani Santoso v. Lee Kong Eng & Alexis Khoo(Divorce 1704/98 and\n\n  RAS 95 & 96/99), the wife had asked for a portion of his year end bonus. The court of the\n\n  first instance declined to make such an order as bonuses were invariably a discretionary measure\n\n  contingent on several factors e.g employees performance, companys performance and a variety\n\n  of other imponderable conditions. On appeal, her Honour, Justice Judith Prakash reversed the\n\n  earlier decision on the issue of bonus and ordered that \"the husband pay the wife additional\n\n  maintenance of S$6,000 for each months bonus received by himif and when(the emphasis\n\n  is mine) he was paid any bonus\". The Court of Appeal in their oral judgment, delivered on 25thJanuary 2000, reversed her decision on this issue. I declined to make a \"if, as and\n\n  when\" order for the following reasons:-the share value of the stock option was based on market value at the time\n\n    it was exercised;the husband had, in the past, not exercised his rights to those stock\n\n    options and this may cause the wife to enquire why he had failed to do so;there may be double counting as the husband was paying maintenance and the\n\n    stock options form part of his salary package;the \"if, as and when\" order was vague and posed uncertainty as\n\n    there would be liabilities to be met when he exercised those rights;the above order also runs contrary to the clean break principle in the\n\n    division of matrimonial asses; andmost importantly, the unvested stock options were allotted to the husband\n\n    after the breakdown of the marriage and her indirect contribution was not substantial enough to\n\n    merit a share in his unvested stock options (see para 11 above).133.    The case ofSusy Suryanti Santoso v Lee Kong Eng &\n\nAlexis Khoocited by the District Judge is not applicable here because there the question was\n\nwhether the husbands bonus should be taken into account for the issue of maintenance. That point\n\ndid not involve stock options or the division of matrimonial assets.134.    Furthermore, as there was no written judgment from the\n\nCourt of Appeal in that case, I am of the view that it is likely that the decision of the Court of\n\nAppeal was on the particular facts in that case. It is not an authority for the proposition that an\n\nif and when order should, generally, not be made.135.    As for the list of reasons given by the District Judge, I\n\nam of the view that:(a) Although it may be said that the share value of a stock option is based on\n\n  market value at the time the option is exercised, it does not follow that this is the only value\n\n  that can be ascribed to a stock option. If the option is vested but not yet exercised, its value\n\n  may be less, and if it is not yet vested, its value may be even lesser. However, as I have already\n\n  said above, this does not detract from the fact of its existence. Furthermore, any difficulty in\n\n  valuing share options under the 2ndand 3rdcategories is not an adequate\n\n  ground for denying their existence or for refusing to attempt to divide them. Thirdly, there is no\n\n  need to give a value at present if an if and when order is made.(b) Although the Wife had made inquiry in the past as to why the Husband did\n\n  not exercise any of the unexercised stock options, this is also not an adequate ground for\n\n  refusing to take such options into account in the division of matrimonial assets. Besides, suffice\n\n  it to say that the Husband is not obliged to exercise the stock options. If he has chosen not to\n\n  exercise them bona fide, the Wife has no legal basis to complain. However if, for example, the\n\n  Husband has given up any right to have the stock options vested in him in exchange for other\n\n  rights or assets in order to defeat the Wifes claim, then the Wife can pursue her legal rights.\n\n  However, the burden will be upon her to establish her assertion.(c) There is no question of double counting if the stock options are not taken\n\n  into account for the maintenance issue.(d) While an if and when order poses some uncertainty, this is also not\n\n  an adequate reason to disregard the stock options in the 2ndand 3rdcategories for the purpose of division. That the Husband would have to pay the exercise price can\n\n  be taken into account in an appropriately worded if and when order.(e) If such an order is vague and does not cover all the eventualities which\n\n  subsequently arises, this can be addressed by the parties seeking clarification or further\n\n  directions. After all, under s 112(3) to (8) of the Womens Charter, the court is given very\n\n  wide powers to give effect to any order it makes for the division of matrimonial assets.\n\n  Furthermore, it is open to the parties to agree on a lump sum settlement of the Wifes\n\n  entitlement to the stock options rather than be troubled with having to comply with an if and\n\n  when order.(f) I would add that the concept of stock options is not novel although it\n\n  appears to be used more and more for so-called New Economy businesses. A scheme for stock options\n\n  provides the answer to attracting and retaining key personnel without causing the businesses to\n\n  fail under the weight of huge salaries before huge returns are achieved. Furthermore, very often,\n\n  it is such a scheme, and not the salary, that attracts the key personnel.136.    Therefore, it is my view that it would be only realistic\n\nto take into account stock options in the context of maintenance or the division of matrimonial\n\nassets, unless there are reasons on the particular facts of a case why this should not be done. No\n\nsuch reasons exist in the case before me.137.    While an if and when order would not achieve the\n\nclear-break principle, this principle is not paramount. It must be subject to the more important\n\nprinciple of justice in accordance with the law.138.    Furthermore, if the stock options (in any of the\n\ncategories) were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage, that is a factor in\n\ndetermining whether the Wife should be granted a share in them and if so, the extent of the share.\n\nIt is not a reason to deny any division outright. In so far as the District Judge said that the Wifes\n\nindirect contribution after the breakdown of the marriage was not substantial enough to merit a\n\nshare, I will come back to this point later below.139.    As this stage, I need refer only toYeo Gim Tong\n\nMichael v Tianzou[1996] 2 SLR 1. In that case, L P Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the\n\nCourt of Appeal, said at p 4:We agree that the husbands CPF moneys accrued or accumulated prior to the\n\n  date of the marriage should be excluded in the computation of the husbands assets for division\n\n  under s 106 of the Womens Charter. But, we are unable to accept that assets acquired by a\n\n  party, and in this case the husband, after the date of the breakdown of the marriage should not be\n\n  included. Subsection (1) and (3) of s 106 each refer to assets acquired during the marriage,\n\n  and the marriage is only dissolved when the decree nisi is made absolute. Normally the ancillary\n\n  matters come before the court for hearing prior to the date when the decree nisi is made absolute.\n\n  As a matter of practically, the court would take, for the purpose of determining the assets\n\n  falling within s 106, in the case of CPF moneys of the spouses, the latest statements issued by\n\n  the Central Provident Fund Board, and in other cases the assets of the spouses as of that date.Therefore\n\n  any assets acquired during the marriage including those acquired after the marriage has broken\n\n  down fall to be considered under these provisions. What contribution a spouse makes to the\n\n  acquisition of such assets during this period depends on the facts of the case.In making a\n\n  division under s 106(3) the court would have regard to the period in which the husband and wife\n\n  have ceased to cohabit and the indirect contribution, if any, made by the wife during the period.\n\n  In this case, the wifes indirect contribution continued: she continued to look after the child\n\n  after she had filed the petition, and her contribution fell within s 106(3).[Emphasis added.]140.Although that case was\n\napplying s 106(1) and (3) of the then Womens Charter (1985 Edition) which are not identical with\n\ns 112(1) and (10) of the present Womens Charter, the judgment of the Court of Appeal on the\n\nmeaning of assets acquired during the marriage would still apply to the same phrase in the\n\npresent s 112(10)(b).141.    I have already set out the provisions of s 112(1) and\n\n(10)(b) of the present Womens Charter.142.    For easy comparison, I set out the provisions of s 106(1)\n\nand (3) of the Womens Charter (1985 Edition):106(1) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce,\n\n  judicial separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any\n\n  assets acquired by them during the marriage by their joint efforts or the sale of any such assets\n\n  and the division between the parties of the proceeds of sale.(2)(3) The court shall have power, when granting a decree of divorce, judicial\n\n  separation or nullity of marriage, to order the division between the parties of any assets\n\n  acquired during the marriage by the sole effort of one party to the marriage or the sale of any\n\n  such assets and the division between the parties of the proceeds of sale.143.    I should also mention that the Wife is confining her claim\n\nto stock options already granted as at the date of the decree nisi (whether vested or not and\n\nwhether exercised or not). This is a fair cut-off point.",
        "Share of the Wife in the stock options": "144.    As regards the 1stcategory of stock options,\n\nthe District Judge had granted the Wife a 15% entitlement.145.    Ms Kanya submitted that the Wife should be entitled to 30%\n\nwhich was the percentage granted by the District Judge to the Wife for her indirect contribution in\n\nrespect of the matrimonial home. She submitted that the same percentage should apply to the stock\n\noptions.146.    However, the facts in relation to the stock options are\n\nnot the same as the facts pertaining to the matrimonial home. The latter had been acquired when the\n\nmarriage had not broken down.147.    The first agreement to grant stock options to the Husband\n\nwas dated 12 August 1996. The Husband left the matrimonial home in February 1997.148.    There was no suggestion that all was well with the\n\nmarriage until February 1997. On the contrary, it is clear that some years before, the marriage had\n\nalready broken down.149.    For example, when the Husband was performing services for\n\nQuorum between 1994 to 1996, he was already under severe stress because of his marital problems,\n\nalthough I would add that he is not as blameless as he would like the court to think.150.    The Wife had been extremely suspicious about the Husband\n\nand harassed his secretary on his whereabouts and even complained to his boss about him. Apparently\n\nshe also threatened to complain to the President of Dell Corporation when the Husband was\n\nsubsequently working for Dell Asia.151.    Although the Wife denied harassing the secretary and\n\ncomplaining to the boss in Quorum, I am of the view that she did complain about him and had been\n\nharassing his secretary and him.152.    The situation did not improve when the Husband began to\n\nwork for Dell Asia in January 1997.153.Thereafter, the Divorce\n\nPetition was filed on 21 November 1997. The 1stMaintenance Complaint was filed on 2\n\nFebruary 1998, the 2ndMaintenance Complaint was filed on 25 June 1998. The Decree Nisi\n\nwas made on 24 September 1998. The parties were engaged in all kinds of acrimonious disputes\n\nincluding access to the children which entailed the filing of numerous affidavits.154.It was because of these\n\nfactors that Mrs Tan submitted that the Wifes indirect contribution was a negative one and that\n\neven 15% was generous although the Husband had decided not to appeal against the decision of the\n\nDistrict Judge on the 15% entitlement of the Wife in respect of the 1stcategory. Mrs Tan\n\nsubmitted that the Wife should not be entitled to any share of the stock options as regards the 2ndand 3rdcategories.155.As regards the argument about\n\nthe Wifes negative contribution, Ms Kanya submitted that the District Judge had taken this\n\nargument into account and had nevertheless granted the Wife 15% of the stock options under the 1stcategory.156.    However, Ms Kanyas submission would in turn detract\n\nfrom her other argument seeking 30% for the Wife for all the three categories.157.The District Judges\n\nreasons for awarding 15% are set out in para 11 of her GD. It includes some of the factors I have\n\nmentioned and the fact that notwithstanding the Wifes so-called negative contribution, the Wife\n\nwas still taking care of the children while the Husband was pursuing his career in Hong Kong.158.The District Judge also took\n\ninto account factors like the Wife (a) having had exclusive use of the matrimonial house since\n\nFebruary 1997 when the Husband left, (b) had obtained 60% of the matrimonial property and (c) 100%\n\nof a property in Gold Coast, Australia, although there is an outstanding mortgage on it which the\n\nWife will be responsible for.159.I am of the view that the\n\nDistrict Judge was correct in awarding 15% of the stock options under the 1stcategory to\n\nthe Wife. However, I do not agree that this should be confined to the 1stcategory only.160.I have already dealt with the\n\nDistrict Judges reasons for declining to give the Wife anything for the stock options under the 2ndand 3rdcategories.161.As regards her last reason\n\ni.e that the unvested stock options were allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the\n\nmarriage, I have already mentioned that the marriage did not breakdown only when the Husband left\n\nthe matrimonial home but some time before. Even the stock options under the 1stcategory\n\nwere allotted to the Husband after the breakdown of the marriage.162.In my view, the fact that the\n\nmarriage had broken down was one of the main reasons for the District Judges decision to allot\n\n15% instead of 30% to the Wife for the 1stcategory. That reason should not be used again\n\nto reduce the 15% to nil for the 2ndand 3rdcategories.163.Accordingly, I am of the view\n\nthat the Wife is entitled to 15% of the stock options under the 2ndand 3rdcategories.",
