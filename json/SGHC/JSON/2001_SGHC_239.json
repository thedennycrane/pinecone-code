        "Discharge of injunction": "4. The grounds of the application for discharge of the injunction were:(1) that the plaintiffs had not established a real risk of dissipation\n    of assets by the defendants; and(2) that the plaintiffs had been in breach of their duty to make full\n    disclosure of all material facts and circumstances in their application for the\n    injunction.The defendants conceded that the plaintiffs had established a good\narguable case.(i) Dissipation5. The affidavit leading to the injunction was made by the plaintiffs'\nlawyer, Mr Navinder Singh. He stated that the defendants had their principal place of\nbusiness in Singapore and that their registered address at the Registry of Companies\n(‘ROC’) was at 10 Anson Road, #35-08 International Plaza, Singapore. However,\nthe address of the defendants given on the charter-party was 10 Anson Road, #30-05A\nInternational Plaza.6. According to Mr Singh, the first invoice sent by the plaintiffs on 8\nJune 2001 was for the sum of US$643,652.12. The defendants did not respond. A second\ndemand for payment was sent on 13 June, a third on 14 June and a fourth on 18 June. The\ndefendants did not respond to any of these demands.7. On 18 June, an inspection of the registered address of the\ndefendants was commissioned by the plaintiffs’ solicitors. This visit disclosed that\nthe defendants did not have their own office. Their registered address was occupied by a\nfirm of accountants called ‘Paul Wan & Co’. The main doors to the office of\nPaul Wan & Co listed all the companies that had their registered offices at the said\nfirm and the defendants’ name was found on the board. Further, according to\ninformation from a telephone company, the defendants did not have a telephone or fax\nnumber and the business directory did not indicate the existence of any company by the\nname of Sino-Add (Singapore) Pte Ltd. Finally, in conference calls between the employees\nof the plaintiffs namely Messrs Chu Kong, Newmen Lock and Yu Ziao Feng, and one Steven\nZhang of the defendants, it was intimated to the plaintiffs’ employees that the\ndefendant company would be abandoned if legal action was taken against it.8. Mr Ling, counsel for the defendants, drew my attention to several\ncases which had reiterated the principle that a plaintiff seeking a mareva injunction must\nsatisfy the court that there is a real risk of the debtor dissipating or disposing of his\nassets in order to intentionally deprive the plaintiff creditor of satisfaction for his\ndebt. This principle was not, and could not be, disputed by the plaintiffs.9. Mr Ling submitted that the plaintiffs had made a bare assertion that\nthere was a real risk of the defendants removing their assets from the jurisdiction simply\nbecause the defendants were not actively trading in Singapore and maintained a registered\naddress that was care of Messrs Paul Wan & Co. The defendants submitted that the fact\nthat they did not have a telephone or fax number nor a business directory listing was\nwholly irrelevant and did not in any way show a risk of dissipation of their assets. Mr\nFan He Li, a director of the defendants, had affirmed in his affidavit that Paul Wan &\nCo had been instructed to handle all incoming calls and correspondence for the defendants\nas well as to provide them with corporate secretarial, audit and accounting tax services.\nAccordingly, the defendants had seen no need to apply for a separate telephone or fax\nnumber. The defendants’ decision not to have a telephone or fax number registered\nunder their own name was a purely commercial one and did not mean that they had a\ntransient presence in Singapore as alleged by the plaintiffs. Nor did it lead inevitably\nto the conclusion that there was a real risk of dissipation of the defendants’\nassets.10. As for the conference calls between the plaintiffs’ employees\nand Steven Zhang, Mr Fan affirmed that he had spoken with Steven Zhang and that the latter\nhad confirmed that he had not uttered any threat to abandon the defendant company if legal\naction was taken. What he had said, in response to the plaintiffs’ threat to sue and\nwind up the defendants, was that the plaintiffs could do whatever they liked to the\ndefendants as he was in no position to stop them.11. Mr Fan also averred that the plaintiffs had conveniently failed to\nhighlight the fact that the defendants had been incorporated on 29 April 1998 and had a\npaid-up capital of S$800,000. Since then they had engaged in substantial business\ntransactions and on sales revenues of $360,814 had made profits of more than $14,000 in\n1998 whilst in 1999, their sales revenue exceeded $11 million and their profits came to\nsome $113,000. It was also pointed out on behalf of the defendants that they had been\nfiling their annual returns and conscientiously paying their taxes to the Singapore\ngovernment.12. Counsel submitted that even if the plaintiffs’ version of\nevents was to be accepted by the court, what was most important and significant was the\nfact that notwithstanding the plaintiffs having issued an arbitration notice on 14 June\n2001 followed by a formal demand for payment on the same day through their London\nsolicitors, the defendants had taken no steps whatsoever to dissipate or otherwise dispose\nof their assets whether in Singapore or elsewhere.13. The plaintiffs, on the other hand, submitted that, with good cause,\nthey had become fearful after the two telephone conversations that Steven Zhang had had\nwith their employees. In one he had said that the defendants would ‘walk away’\nif the plaintiffs proceeded with legal action and in another that the defendants would\n‘disappear’ and that they had no assets at all. Far from being a bare assertion,\nthis allegation was based on the evidence of two of the plaintiffs’ employees as to\nwhat had been told to them directly. Subsequent to the grant of the injunction, these\nemployees had filed affidavits in which they verified the plaintiffs’ version of\nevents which had first been put forward through their solicitors.14. In my view, the plaintiffs had established that there was a risk of\nthe assets being removed from Singapore so as to avoid satisfying a judgment against the\ndefendants. First, they had given evidence of direct threats by the defendants to\ndisappear. Although the plaintiffs’ accounts of the telephone conversations were\ndisputed by the defendants, the court could not at this interlocutory stage give no weight\nat all to the evidence of the plaintiffs simply because it was disputed. There were two\nemployees of the plaintiffs who were prepared to go on oath with their allegations and\nthat stand had to be given due consideration. The allegation made was not a bare\nallegation. It had a factual basis in what allegedly occurred during conversations between\nthe parties.15. Secondly, although the defendants were a company incorporated in\nSingapore, this in itself did not mean that they had a substantial presence here and were\nunlikely to remove assets from this jurisdiction in order to avoid the affect of a\njudgment against them. It was notable that all three of the directors of the defendant\ncompany were Chinese citizens. These three persons were also the only shareholders of the\ncompany. Apart from one of them, Zhang Shujing (whom I take to be Steven Zhang), the\naddresses of the directors and shareholders given in the ROC’s records were addresses\nin Heping District Shenyany China. For Steven Zhang a Singapore address was given, but\nthat address was the address of Paul Wan & Co’s office. No residential address in\nSingapore was given. He too, therefore, did not appear to be physically present in\nSingapore on a regular, let alone permanent, basis.16. Further, the defendants did not appear to have any commercial\npresence in Singapore at all. Their address at Paul Wan & Co’s office could not\nbe considered a commercial address. As the plaintiffs submitted, whilst a company may use\nthe address of an accounting firm as its registered address, the accounting firm does not\ncarry on the business of the company nor participate in its day-to-day running. At best,\nthe accounting firm would provide corporate secretarial support in terms of the filing of\nthe annual returns on behalf the company and also lodgement of any necessary documents\nwith the ROC. The company would usually carry on its business at another place that would\nbe its ordinary business address.17. The plaintiffs submitted that the defendants’ presence in\nSingapore was limited to the existence of a brass plate and was a transient one. As an\naccounting firm, Paul Wan & Co were unlikely to engage in facilitating or carrying out\nship chartering business for and on behalf of the defendants. I agreed that Paul Wan &\nCo were not likely to carry on business as ship charterers or handle the defendants’\nbusiness activities on their behalf. It was clear from the evidence that the plaintiffs\nhad all along been dealing with Mr Zhang and other directors of the defendant company.\nThey had not been dealing with Paul Wan & Co or any of the latter’s employees.\nThe defendants’ presence in Singapore was a legal one only. Apart from bank deposits,\nmany of which turned out to be held in the name of Sino-Trust instead of the\ndefendants’ own name, the defendants were not able to point to any assets here. They\nhad no staff, no office, and not even a telephone or fax number in Singapore. Obviously,\ntheir physical presence in Singapore was limited to the bare minimum required by the law\nie the notice board outside the offices of Messrs Paul Wan & Co.18. All the circumstances showed that the defendants’ connection\nwith Singapore was legal and peripheral only. In view of the threat that had been made and\nthe failure of the defendants to deal in any substantive way with the plaintiffs’\ndemands for payment, a serious risk of dissipation or removal of assets had been\nestablished.(ii) Non-disclosure19. On this ground, the defendants relied on the established principles\nthat parties seeking injunctions must make full and frank disclosure of all material facts\nand circumstances, including matters which are or may be adverse to them and that this\nduty of disclosure applies not only to facts known to such party but to those which he\nwould have known if he had made proper enquiries. SeeBank Mellat v Nikpour[1985] FSR 87andBrinks-Mat Ltd v Elcombe[1980] 3 All ER 188.20. The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs had failed to make\nfull and frank disclosure of the following material facts:(1) that far from having a ‘transient presence’ in Singapore,\n    the defendants were in fact incorporated here in April 1998 with a substantial paid-up\n    capital of $800,000;(2) based on the audited accounts of the defendants for the years 1998\n    to 1999, the defendants had engaged in substantial business transactions including with\n    the plaintiffs themselves;(3) that they had by their London solicitors given formal notice to the\n    defendants on 14 June 2001 that they were referring the dispute for arbitration in London\n    (although the letter was exhibited in Mr Singh’s affidavit, the defendants’\n    complaint was that the fact had not been disclosed in the text of the affidavit);(4) that they had not released the cargo shipped to the consignee and\n    had effectively asserted a lien over the same and this meant that they had some security\n    for the claim.21. Dealing with the last point first, the fact that the cargo may not\nhave been released to the consignee was not relevant to the plaintiffs’ claim against\nthe defendants. The defendants as charterers were liable, subject to any available\ndefences, not only for freight but also for dead freight and demurrage under the\ncharter-party. The plaintiffs’ claim was not against the shippers or the cargo and\nthe plaintiffs were entitled to look to the defendants to satisfy their contractual\nliability. The defendants were not named as shippers or receivers on the bill of lading.\nAny claim that the plaintiffs might have had for freight under the bill of lading was a\nclaim arising under a separate contract and had nothing to do with the defendants’\nliabilities.22. As regards the incorporation of the defendants in Singapore and\ntheir paid-up capital, the plaintiffs had disclosed copies of their searches at the ROC\nthat made it quite clear what the paid-up capital of the defendants was. The plaintiffs\nhad specifically stated in their affidavit that the defendants were incorporated in\nSingapore and had a registered office here. All pertinent information as to directors,\nshareholders, authorised, issued and paid-up capital was in the ROC searches and I do not\nthink it was necessary for the plaintiffs to specifically reproduce that information in\nthe text of their affidavit in order to disclose it. The ROC search is a document that is\neasily read and understood. Any registrar or judge hearing the plaintiffs’\napplication for injunction would quite naturally and automatically turn to such a search\nin order to obtain information about the paid-up capital of the company whom it was\nalleged was on the verge of disappearing in order to find out what minimal information\nabout the company could be gleaned from the official records.23. The fact that the defendants had engaged in substantial business\ntransactions did not seem to me to be a material matter for disclosure. The issue was\nwhether there was a risk of dissipation or removal of assets. The defendants were\ncharterers and traders who had been able to carry on their ‘substantial business\ntransactions’ from outside Singapore with only a nominal presence here. In the\ncurrent financial environment where large sums of money can be moved from one jurisdiction\nto another in the blink of an eye and where business transactions in any part of the world\ncan be effected from any other part of the world through the use of the telephone, the fax\nand the e-mail, the magnitude of the defendants’ business transactions seemed to me\nto be a neutral factor which would not affect the risk of dissipation one way or the\nother.24. As regards the point on arbitration, paragraph 16 of Mr\nSingh’s affidavit stated specifically that by faxes dated 14 June 2001, the\nplaintiffs’ English solicitors, Messrs Holmes Hardingham, had invited the defendants\nto proceed with arbitration and that once again no response had been received from the\ndefendants. In view of this, there was no substance in the defendants’ assertion of\nnon-disclosure of the intended arbitration proceedings especially as they themselves\nadmitted that the text of the solicitors’ notice had been annexed to the affidavit as\nan exhibit.25. I found no merit in any of the assertions made by the defendants of\nmaterial non-disclosure.Stay of proceedings26. The defendants’ submission that the proceedings should be\nstayed in favour of arbitration was based on clause 32 of the charter-party. This provides\nthat ‘General Average and arbitration if any to be settled and adjusted in London,\nEnglish Law to apply’. The defendants argued that the true construction of this\nclause was that it evidenced the parties’ agreement to settle all disputes under the\ncharter-party by arbitration in London. They referred to the case ofTritonia Shipping\nInc v South Nelson Forest Products Corporation[1996] 1 LLR 114. The charter-party in\nthat case contained a clause that read simply ‘Arbitration to be settled in\nLondon’ and there was a dispute over whether this clause amounted to a binding\nsubmission to arbitration. It was held that this clause, brief as it was, could only have\nthe one meaning and must be expanded to mean. ‘Any dispute under this charter-party\nto be settled by arbitration in London’.27. The plaintiffs argued that the clause in this case did not have the\none meaning that was found to exist in theTritoniadecision. They called in aid\nthe holding inThe ‘Ioanna’[1978] 1 LLR 238. The first sentence in that\nclause in that case (clause 13) was almost identical to clause 32 in the present\ncharter-party. It read ‘General Average & arbitration to be settled according to\nYork-Antwerp Rules 1950 in London …’. The question there as it was here was\nwhether the clause meant that the parties had agreed that all matters in dispute under the\ncharter-party should be settled by arbitration in London or whether it meant that all\ndisputes relating to general average had to be so settled and that there was no agreement\nto arbitrate any other type of dispute. It should be noted that in that case the phrases\n‘& arbitration’ and ‘in London’ had been typed into clause 13 of\nthe charter-party as it appeared on the printed Gencon form.28. On appeal, it was held that on the true construction of the clause\nthe words ‘& arbitration’ indicated that the parties were agreeing to prefer\narbitration to litigation in the Courts of any country for any dispute as to general\naverage which might arise and it was English law which was to apply to the settlement of\nthese disputes. In the course of his judgment, Stephenson LJ referred to theTritoniacase\nbut did not find much assistance in it for his task of construing clause 13. Referring toTritoniaand another decision, the judge stated that both those cases dealt with a separate\narbitration clause, and not a reference to an arbitration introduced to a clause dealing\nwith a particular subject matter.29. In coming to his decision, Stephenson LJ adopted the arguments of\ncounsel (one Mr Collins) who propounded the view that the agreement on arbitration was\nlimited to general average matters:‘It seems to me one must, without the assistance of authority,\n    simply look at the wording of this clause, and doing that, it does seem to me naturally to\n    have the meaning which Mr Collins gives it and asks us to give it. He points out that the\n    law which would apply to a general average dispute is the law of the port of destination,\n    and that adjustments of general average can be settled in one place and be nonetheless\n    governed by the law of the port of destination; and he referred us to r. G of the\n    York-Antwerp Rules, 1950. There is, therefore, nothing difficult or contradictory in a\n    provision that general average is to be settled in accordance with the York-Antwerp Rules;\n    the Gencon form does not print or provide a space for inserting the place where that\n    adjustment is to be; other forms of charter-party do, and the insertion of the words\n    \"in London\" first of all determined where the adjustment is to take place and\n    probably which law is to apply to disputes as to general average. Then he submits –\n    and I do not think Mr Tomlinson challenged this – that disputes as to liability to\n    make general average contribution are by no means unusual and it is, therefore, reasonable\n    to provide for the settlement of those disputes by arbitration, and the words \"&\n    arbitration\", there being no provision for arbitration in the York-Antwerp Rules\n    referred to in this clause, first of all show that the parties are agreeing to prefer\n    arbitration to litigation in the Courts of any country for any dispute as to general\n    average which may arise, and, secondly, make definite and clear that which might have been\n    only probable but uncertain, that it is English law which is to apply to the settlement of\n    those disputes.’30. In the present case, the charter-party contract comprised two\nparts. The first part was the printed ‘ \"Gencon\" Charter (As Revised 1922\nand 1976)’ form with agreed amendments and at the bottom of this form it was stated\nthat clauses 18 to 37 attached were incorporated as part of the charter-party. These\nclauses were typewritten clauses and included clause 32 which I have already quoted. For\nthe purposes of this contract, general average was dealt with in two clauses: the\naforesaid typewritten clause 32 and clause 11 which appeared in the printed form. Clause\n11 stated ‘General average to be settled according to York-Antwerp Rules, 1974.\nProprietors of cargo to pay the cargo’s share in the general expenses even if same\nhave been necessitated through neglect or default of the Owners’ servants’.31. It appeared to me that when the two clauses dealing with general\naverage were taken together ie the printed clause providing for the governing rules and\nthe typewritten clause providing for the place where general average was to be settled and\nthe governing law of such settlement, the reasoning of Stephenson LJ in construing the\nclause before him applied equally to the clauses before me. I therefore accepted the\nsubmission of the plaintiffs that clause 32 in the present charter-party related only to\narbitration of general average disputes and was not a general arbitration agreement. This\nbeing the case, there was no question of an automatic stay of the present proceedings as\nthe dispute brought to this court had nothing to do with general average.32. The defendants also contended that the plaintiffs, having given\nnotice to their solicitors on 14 June that they wished to arbitrate, had by such action\ncommenced arbitration proceedings. They had then commenced legal proceedings in Singapore\nclaiming identical reliefs as those claimed in the intended arbitration proceedings in\nLondon. Counsel submitted that the plaintiffs having made an express election in the\nmatter, their conduct in bringing simultaneous proceedings in two separate jurisdictions\nfor the same claims arising out of the same subject matter was an abuse of process.33. The plaintiffs’ answer to the above point was that they were\nnot obliged by clause 32 to arbitrate but that they did have the freedom to agree with the\ndefendants that the disputes between the parties should be litigated by arbitration in\nLondon. The notice of arbitration by their English solicitors was nothing more than an\ninvitation to the defendants to settle the dispute in this manner. The defendants had not\nresponded in any way to this invitation nor had they agreed to the joint appointment of\nthe person nominated by the plaintiffs as sole arbitrator nor had they taken any steps to\nappoint their own arbitrator in connection with the arbitration. In these circumstances, I\ntook the view that the notice issued by the plaintiffs’ solicitors had lapsed or had\nbeen revoked by the plaintiffs’ commencement of legal proceedings in Singapore. Since\nthe defendants had not indicated their agreement to arbitrate in any way prior to the\ncommencement of the present proceedings, I did not consider that they had any ground to\napply for a stay on that basis before me. The situation would have been different had the\ndefendants replied promptly to say that they were willing to arbitrate because then the\nplaintiffs would have been bound to proceed in that manner. Instead, it was only in the\naffidavit which Mr Fan filed in support of the defendants’ application for a stay\nthat he indicated that the defendants were agreeable to referring the matter to\narbitration and would be instructing their own solicitors in London to advise the latter\naccordingly. It appeared to me that this was an opportunistic submission to arbitration\nthat would not have occurred but for the institution of these proceedings and the issuing\nof the mareva injunction.34. I was satisfied that there was no basis on which to order a stay of\nthe proceedings.JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
