        "Issues": "14. The plaintiffs brought this action\n\npursuant to s 127(1) of the Land Titles Act (Cap 157) (‘the Act’) which permits\n\nthem as caveatee in relation to the caveat lodged by the defendants, to summon the\n\ndefendant caveators to attend before the court to show cause why the caveat should not be\n\nwithdrawn or otherwise removed. They rely also on s 128(1) of the Act which imposes a\n\nliability to pay compensation on any person who wrongfully, vexatiously or without\n\nreasonable cause lodges a caveat with the Registrar or refuses or fails to withdraw such a\n\ncaveat after being requested to do so.15. The defendants in response to the show\n\ncause aspect rely on the Agreement and contend that as it has been executed by both\n\nparties it is a valid agreement for purchase and sale of the property and, as purchaser\n\nthereunder, they have an equitable interest in the property which entitled them to lodge\n\nand maintain the caveat. The principle issue therefore, as stated above, is whether the\n\nAgreement is valid and binding on both parties. There are a number of sub issues. These\n\nare:(1) whether the option granted to Amethyst\n\n  lapsed without being exercised;(2) whether the option was validly\n\n  exercised by the defendants;(3) what proposition was put to Philip\n\n  Chan by Gary Lee in connection with the purchase of the property;(4) when exactly the Agreement was signed\n\n  by the defendants and if they did not sign it until 24 December whether the late signature\n\n  affected the validity of the Agreement;(5) whether the plaintiffs had agreed that\n\n  the option fee would be treated as the deposit under the Agreement and if not:(a) whether it was a condition precedent\n\n    to the validity of the Agreement that the deposit had to be paid by the defendants; or(b) if not a condition precedent, then\n\n    whether payment of the deposit was a fundamental term of the agreement such that\n\n    non-payment permitted the plaintiffs to repudiate the Agreement and if so whether the\n\n    plaintiffs did in fact repudiate the Agreement;The evidence(i) The plaintiffs’ story: (a) Gulab\n\nBhojraj @ Sam Bhojraj16. Sam Bhojraj’s evidence-in-chief\n\nwas given by way of two affidavits. In the first, he set out the circumstances under which\n\nthe plaintiffs agreed to purchase the property and then went on to deal with the option\n\ngranted to Amethyst. His account was brief. He stated that the option was to be exercised\n\nby 4pm on 22 December 1999 but it was not duly exercised within the stipulated period and\n\ntherefore ‘[t]he option lapsed and the option fee was accordingly forfeited by the\n\nPlaintiffs’. He then stated that the plaintiffs had paid their agents, ALP, a\n\ncommission of $10,000 for services rendered. In support, he exhibited copies of the\n\nplaintiffs’ payment voucher, the agents’ invoice and the plaintiffs’ cheque\n\nfor the amount paid, all of which were dated 22 January 2000.17. The Agreement was dealt with, briefly,\n\nin paras 6 and 7 of the first affidavit. Sam Bhojraj stated that on 23 December 1999,\n\npursuant to the defendants’ request, the plaintiffs agreed to enter into a sale and\n\npurchase agreement with the defendants for the sale of the property to the defendants at a\n\nprice of $2,420,000 on condition that the defendants signed and returned the Agreement and\n\nmade payment of the sum of $24,000 on the same day failing which there would be no sale.\n\nIn para 7 he stated that the defendants did not return the Agreement duly signed nor did\n\nthey pay the sum of $24,000 to the plaintiffs. Accordingly, no binding contract was\n\nconcluded between the plaintiffs and the defendants for the sale of the property. He went\n\non to say that this account was confirmed by the agents’ letter dated 22 January\n\n2000.18. A copy of that letter was exhibited.\n\nIt reads:‘Re: 42 Ceylon RoadI, Gary Lee Twe Jeat I/C 1412520E, am\n\n  the agent for the vendor of the above mentioned property. I have sold the said property to\n\n  Amethyst Construction Pte Ltd which option was dated 27thOct 1999 and the\n\n  validity expires on 22ndDec 1999 if not exercised. It was not exercised on the\n\n  date fixed for exercise.Thereafter the vendor i.e. Focus\n\n  Electronics Pte Ltd issued a Sale and Purchase Agreement to Touch Universal Pte Ltd with\n\n  the condition that the said Sale and Purchase Agreement must be returned on the same day\n\n  i.e. 23rdDec 1999.As the buyer, Touch Universal Pte Ltd did\n\n  not sign and gave me back the Sale and Purchase Agreement on the same day of which I\n\n  informed the vendor who told me that now the Sale and Purchase Agreement is null and void(sic).On the 24thof December 1999,\n\n  the vendor informed me that they are issuing a new Option to another Buyer.I confirm that the above to be true and\n\n  correct.Yours sincerelyGary Lee’19. Sam Bhojraj went on to say that as\n\nthere was no sale contract between the plaintiffs and the defendants, the plaintiffs had\n\ngranted an option to Mr Lim Chai Huat and/or his nominee on 24 December for the sale of\n\nthe property. The option had been exercised on 27 December 1999 by Sea Union as Mr\n\nLim’s nominee and completion of that sale was scheduled to take place on 10 February\n\n2000.20. On 28 December 1999, Sea Union had\n\nlodged a caveat against the property and on 10 January 2000, the defendants’ then\n\nsolicitors had written to the plaintiffs’ solicitors to seek clarification on this\n\ncaveat. In response, the plaintiffs’ solicitors by their letter dated 14 January 2000\n\nhad informed the defendants’ solicitors that as the defendants did not sign and\n\nreturn the Agreement to the plaintiffs within the agreed period with the required deposit,\n\nthe sale was deemed aborted.21. On 19 January the defendants lodged a\n\ncaveat against the property and the next day their solicitors wrote to the\n\nplaintiffs’ solicitors stating that concurrently with the signing of the Agreement\n\nthe defendants had handed over a deposit of $24,000 representing one percent of the\n\npurchase price.22. The affidavit then continued with\n\nfurther details of correspondence between the parties and stated that despite demand the\n\ndefendants had failed to withdraw the caveat. They had also failed to provide any evidence\n\nto show that they had returned the agreement and made payment of $24,000 on 23 December\n\n1999 to the plaintiffs or their solicitors.23. Sam Bhojraj’s second affidavit\n\nwas basically a reply to Danny Leow’s affidavit. Much of it consisted of denial of\n\npoints made by Danny Leow and explanations for the stand taken by the plaintiffs. Among\n\nthese was Sam Bhojraj’s assertion that the plaintiffs did not agree nor did they\n\nauthorise Gary Lee to agree to vary the terms of the option given to Amethyst such that\n\nthe option fee would be treated as full consideration for a binding contract and that the\n\nplaintiffs would waive their rights to the balance ten percent. They also did not agree\n\nthat the variation of the terms of the option would be reduced to writing in a freshly\n\nissued sale and purchase agreement to be prepared by the plaintiffs’ solicitors. He\n\nalso stated that the defendants had allegedly signed the Acceptance Copy of the Amethyst\n\noption after its expiry.24. During cross-examination, Sam Bhojraj\n\nstated that on 22 December he had telephoned Gary Lee many times to ask him whether\n\nAmethyst would be exercising the option. By 4pm nothing had occurred. Later that evening,\n\nhe called Gary Lee again to reproach him for Amethyst’s non-exercise of the option.\n\nSam Bhojraj asked whether money was a problem for Amethyst. Gary Lee then said that he\n\nwould talk to Amethyst. Later that night Sam Bhojraj called Gary Lee for the fourth time\n\nand was told that Amethyst was involved in some projects and their cash flow was pretty\n\ntight. Sam Bhojraj then asked whether Amethyst would still be interested in the deal if\n\nthe plaintiffs required a lower deposit, maybe one or two percent, instead of the usual\n\nten percent. However, this time around they would go straight to a sale and purchase\n\nagreement instead of having an option first.25. The next morning, 23 December, Gary\n\nLee telephoned him and told him that Amethyst was agreeable to the plaintiffs’\n\nproposal of having a fresh sale and purchase agreement issued. However, they had indicated\n\nthat they wanted this agreement to be in favour of the defendants, Touch Universal Pte\n\nLtd, as the buyer. Slightly later in his cross-examination, Sam Bhojraj stated that on\n\nthat morning Gary Lee went to his office and told him that the intended buyers were the\n\ndefendants. He raised no objections to this proposal even though he had not previously\n\nheard of the defendants. This was at about 10am. He and Gary Lee then proceeded to the\n\nplaintiffs’ solicitors’ office to have the Agreement prepared. During\n\nre-examination Sam Bhojraj stated that it was only when they were in the solicitors’\n\noffice that he learnt that the defendants and not Amethyst were to be the purchasers of\n\nthe property and this was because he overheard Gary Lee informing the solicitors’\n\nclerk who the purchasers were.26. The Agreement was ready by 11am. After\n\nsigning it on behalf of the plaintiffs, Sam Bhojraj gave Gary Lee two copies of the\n\ndocument telling him that they were handed over on condition that they were to be returned\n\nthe same day duly signed by the defendants together with a consideration of $24,000 and\n\nthe names of the defendants’ lawyers so that the plaintiffs could immediately confirm\n\nthe sale. He also told Gary Lee that if he did not get the documents back with the cheque\n\nby the end of the day he would take it for sure that the defendants had no further\n\ninterest in the property. By ‘the end of the day’, he meant by 9 or 10pm.27. Gary Lee left with the Agreement but\n\nnothing came back. Sam Bhojraj called Gary Lee throughout the day to find out the status\n\nof the matter. He kept asking the agent whether the deal was on or off and the reply that\n\nwas given was that the agent was still talking to the defendants. The last conversation\n\nwas some time after midnight of 23 December. Gary Lee told Sam Bhojraj that he was still\n\nmeeting the defendants and that he would talk to the plaintiffs later that day. At that\n\npoint, Sam Bhojraj did not tell Gary Lee that the deal was off.28. I asked Sam Bhojraj when he had told\n\nthe agent that he was calling off the deal. The reply was ‘on 24 December’. When\n\nquestioned whether he had asked Gary Lee to give him back the two copies of the Agreement,\n\nthe answer was ‘No’. He went on to say that he had told Gary Lee that the deal\n\nwas off around noon of that day. It was pointed out to him that in Gary Lee’s\n\naffidavit the latter had said that the Agreement had been signed by the defendants on the\n\nmorning of 24 December but Sam Bhojraj testified that Gary Lee had not told him this\n\nduring their conversation at noon. He asserted Gary Lee had not reacted at all to the\n\ninformation that the deal was off. Later the witness changed his testimony on the time at\n\nwhich he had told Gary Lee that the deal was off: he brought that time forward to 11am\n\ninstead of noon.29. Sam Bhojraj went on to say that he had\n\nnever received from Gary Lee the copy of the Agreement signed by the defendants. This was\n\ndespite Gary Lee having testified in his affidavit that that document had been slipped\n\nunder the door of the plaintiffs’ office on 24 December itself. Sam Bhojraj asserted\n\nthat on that day, he and three employees had worked till 5pm and the office was open all\n\nthe while yet he had not received the document. Yet the witness was reluctant to assert\n\nthat Gary Lee had lied on the point until he was pressed to confirm this.30. There were several questions about the\n\ncommission which the plaintiffs had paid ALP. At the beginning, Sam Bhojraj testified, the\n\nplaintiffs had agreed to pay the agent $5,000 as commission for the sale of the property\n\nto Amethyst. Sam Bhojraj’s explanation for this rather low commission (much less than\n\nthe usual one` percent) was that as he was making nothing from the sale of the land, he\n\ntold Gary Lee that the plaintiffs would only pay him that amount. Eventually, however, the\n\nplaintiffs had paid $10,000 as commission. The explanation for the increase was that Gary\n\nLee had met Sam Bhojraj and said that since the plaintiffs had forfeited $24,000 from\n\nAmethyst, they should be fair and pay the agent a bit more than what had been agreed on.31. The agent’s invoice for $10,000\n\nwas dated 22 January 2000. By that time, the plaintiffs were aware that Gary Lee had got\n\nthe defendants to sign the agreement and were also aware, as the witness conceded, that\n\nGary Lee had acted against their instructions by proceeding to get the defendants to sign\n\nthe agreement on 24 December 1999. The witness was asked why in that case he had paid the\n\nagent double the original commission. The reply was that $10,000 had been paid because\n\n$24,000 had been forfeited. It was then pointed out that the commission was supposed to be\n\n$5,000 if the sale went through and double had been paid though the sale had not gone\n\nthrough. Sam Bhojraj’s response was that he had no reason for doing this except that\n\nGary Lee asked for $10,000 and had told the plaintiffs to be fair as he had worked very\n\nhard.32. It was pointed out to the witness that\n\nthe agents’ letter of 22 January contained untrue statements in that the third\n\nparagraph of the letter had stated that as the defendants did not sign the sale and\n\npurchase agreement on 23 December itself, the plaintiffs had told Gary Lee that the sale\n\nand purchase agreement had become void. This paragraph was inconsistent with Sam\n\nBhojraj’s testimony that he had not called the deal off until 24 December. The\n\nwitness did not agree that the letter was inaccurate. Nor did he agree with the suggestion\n\nthat he had paid the agent double commission as an incentive for Gary Lee to write the\n\nletter to help get the plaintiffs out of the difficult situation they were in due to\n\nhaving sold the same property to two different parties.33. As regards the option given to Mr Lim,\n\nSam Bhojraj testified that negotiations for this option had started at about 2pm on 24\n\nDecember. ALP had not been the plaintiffs’ agent for that transaction. The option had\n\nbeen handed to the prospective purchaser in the plaintiffs’ office at about 5pm that\n\nday. Sam Bhojraj was asked why the plaintiffs had rushed to issue this option and\n\npreferred this sale at a price that was less than that offered by the defendants. His\n\nanswer was that the defendants had not been serious buyers whereas the second buyer was a\n\ngenuine buyer and this was so even though he first came to know about the second buyer on\n\n24 December itself. It was put to him that the reason why the plaintiffs had granted the\n\noption to Mr Lim had been because they needed the deposit money of $235,000 and an\n\nexercised option in order to get financing from Overseas Union Trust to complete their own\n\npurchase of the property. Sam Bhojraj disagreed though he admitted that a signed sale and\n\npurchase agreement would definitely help him and that when the plaintiffs did complete the\n\npurchase, the property was mortgaged by them to Overseas Union Trust.34. The plaintiffs had first approached\n\nOverseas Union Trust for financing between 10 and 15 December 1999. When they were served\n\nwith the 21 day notice on 21 December, they had sounded out three or four banks and had\n\nbeen told that if they could on-sell the property, the banks would finance up to 80\n\npercent of the purchase price whereas if the plaintiffs intended to keep it, they would\n\nonly be able to borrow 60 percent of the price. Sam Bhojraj agreed that by 24 December the\n\nplaintiffs were late in completing their purchase and the reason for this was because they\n\nwere still arranging to obtain finance. He denied the suggestion made by defence counsel\n\nthat the option granted to Mr Lim was attractive to the plaintiffs because it gave them an\n\nextra $235,000 as deposit and the exercised option could be used to obtain bank financing.\n\nDuring re-examination, he was asked why the plaintiffs had not completed their purchase\n\nwithin the prescribed time. The reply given was that he had been in the midst of talking\n\nto a few banks and knew ‘very surely’ that he was capable of arranging for a\n\nloan within a week from the date of the notice to complete.(b) Gary Lee Twe Jeat35. In his affidavit of evidence-in-chief,\n\nGary Lee stated that as the option granted to Amethyst had not been exercised by 4pm on 22\n\nDecember it lapsed and the option fee was forfeited by the plaintiffs. He went on to say\n\nthat on 23 December he was instructed by the plaintiffs that they were still prepared to\n\nsell the property at the same price but that the sale would have to be by way of a sale\n\nand purchase agreement and the agreement returned on the same day.36. Thereafter he spoke to Philip Chan\n\nover the speaker phone at the plaintiffs’ office in the presence of Sam Bhojraj to\n\ninform Philip Chan about the plaintiffs’ proposal. Philip Chan agreed to the proposal\n\nand confirmed that the defendants would be the party who would enter into the sale and\n\npurchase agreement with the plaintiffs.37. Gary Lee confirmed that Sam Bhojraj\n\nhad instructed him to take the Agreement to the defendants for their execution and that\n\nafter the defendants had signed the Agreement, one copy was to be kept by them and the\n\nother was to be returned to him. Gary Lee was told to ask the defendants to instruct their\n\nsolicitors to correspond directly with the plaintiffs’ solicitors. His role as the\n\nhousing agent was merely to convey the Agreement between the parties.38. During the course of that day, Gary\n\nLee received many telephone calls from Sam Bhojraj to remind him that the Agreement had to\n\nbe returned, signed by the defendants, on 23 December, failing which the plaintiffs would\n\ntreat the sale of the property as null and void. Sam Bhojraj also informed him that the\n\nplaintiffs would allow the defendants up to 10pm that evening to return the signed\n\nAgreement. As Gary Lee was having difficulty getting the defendants to execute it, the\n\nplaintiffs granted an extension of time to 11pm. The Agreement was not signed within the\n\nextended period. According to his affidavit, the next conversation took place at about 1am\n\nand in it: ‘Sam [Bhojraj] told me [Gary Lee] that as it was rather late and as I had\n\nyet to hear from the defendants and there was no confirmation that I cannot hand over the\n\nalleged agreement to the defendant the next day, I therefore believed that the deal was\n\nstill on’. This garbled account was, unfortunately, typical of the type of evidence\n\ngiven by the witness.39. Gary Lee averred that each time he was\n\ngiven instructions by the plaintiffs on 23 December, he conveyed those instructions to\n\nboth Philip Chan and the defendants and even advised them that the plaintiffs might grant\n\nan option to another buyer if the agreement was not signed and returned the same day. But\n\ndespite his ‘relentless effort’ he was not successful in procuring the\n\ndefendants’ signature.40. On the morning of 24 December, Gary\n\nLee contacted Philip Chan again to arrange for the execution of the Agreement. In contrast\n\nto what had happened the previous day this time he had no difficulty fixing an appointment\n\nwith the defendants. He then went straight to Philip Chan’s office and the execution\n\ntook place. Gary Lee told the defendants that the respective solicitors must get in touch\n\nas soon as possible. Thereafter, at about 12pm on 24 December, Gary Lee went to the\n\nplaintiffs’ office in High Street Centre and slipped the signed Agreement under the\n\ndoor of the office. Later that day Sam Bhojraj telephoned him to inform him that the\n\nplaintiffs were issuing a fresh option to sell the property to a new buyer. The men did\n\nnot, however, discuss the Agreement. Under cross-examination on this point, Gary Lee said\n\nhe had told Sam Bhojraj not to issue the option to the new purchaser.41. The last two paragraphs of Gary\n\nLee’s affidavit dealt with his commission and his letter on 22 January 2000. He said\n\n‘Since the sale of the property under the first option [ie the Amethyst option] was\n\naborted and I assumed there was no sale of the property under the alleged agreement, I\n\nwent ahead to issue an invoice for a sum of $10,000 being commission for services rendered\n\nby ALP to the plaintiffs. I have also at the plaintiffs’ request confirmed the events\n\nof my unsuccessful sale of the property in my letter dated 22ndJanuary 2000 to\n\nthe plaintiffs’.42. It would be noted from the above\n\naccount that even on paper there were a number of inconsistencies between Gary Lee’s\n\nevidence and that of Sam Bhojraj. Also, Gary Lee’s account was sparse and sometimes\n\nincomprehensible. The inconsistencies increased when he was cross-examined.43. Gary Lee was asked first about the\n\ncommission payable when ALP was appointed by the plaintiffs to look for a buyer for the\n\nproperty. He stated that he had expected to get one percent of the sale price but that\n\nwhat had been agreed between him and the plaintiffs at the time of the issue of the option\n\nto Amethyst was that ALP would be paid $10,000 if the sale was successful. If the sale\n\nwere to be aborted, however, the commission would be $5,000. This was the exact opposite\n\nof Sam Bhojraj’s testimony that the agreed commission was only $5,000 for a\n\nsuccessful sale and the additional $5,000 had been paid because of the forfeiture of the\n\noption fee.44. During the latter part of the\n\ncross-examination, Gary Lee was asked what was supposed to happen to his commission on the\n\nsale to the defendants. His response was that the plaintiffs would have to pay him and\n\nthat this was because he had put in an effort to serve the parties. I then asked how much\n\nthe plaintiffs were supposed to pay him and his reply was $10,000. When asked why it was\n\nthat amount, the response was ‘because of goodwill’. Gary Lee then said that by\n\n‘goodwill’ he meant his years of serving Sam Bhojraj. He went on to confirm that\n\nthe original arrangement was that if the sale was aborted the plaintiffs would only need\n\nto pay him half the commission but stated that whilst the sale to Amethyst had been\n\naborted, the sale to the defendants had not been completed. He admitted that although the\n\namount of $10,000 was only due if everything was completed, he had already been paid it.\n\nHe justified having sent an invoice to the plaintiffs for $10,000 prior to completion on\n\nthe basis that he had told Sam Bhojraj that there had been so much more work to do than\n\noriginally planned and also that he was jealous of another property agent to whom the\n\nplaintiffs always paid a one percent commission.45. Gary Lee agreed that he had received\n\nhis cheque for $10,000 on the very day that the invoice was sent out and on the same day\n\nthat his letter of 22 January was written. He confirmed he had prepared the letter at the\n\nrequest of the plaintiffs and that the contents of the letter had come from the\n\nplaintiffs. Payment of the $10,000 was made to him after he signed the letter.46. The witness was cross-examined\n\nextensively on the events of 22 and 23 December. He stated that on the morning of 22\n\nDecember, he called Philip Chan to ask whether the option would be exercised and reminded\n\nhim that the balance of the deposit was payable on that day. Philip Chan’s response\n\nwas that Amethyst might or might not exercise the option. This was conveyed to Sam Bhojraj\n\nwho asked him to speak with Philip Chan again. On the second occasion Philip Chan was\n\nequally non-committal and when this attitude was conveyed to the plaintiffs, the response\n\nwas that they should wait until the time for exercising the option had expired.47. Gary Lee said that he did not speak to\n\nSam Bhojraj again until the next day, 23 December, when the latter asked him to go to the\n\nplaintiffs’ office. This was some time in the late morning. At the office, the agent\n\nwas scolded for introducing a buyer who had failed to exercise the option. Then Sam\n\nBhojraj said ‘can you call the buyer and ask him whether or not buyer is prepared to\n\ntake one percent and pay 90 percent on completion but on condition that he signs a sale\n\nand purchase agreement’. The witness explained that by ‘take one percent’\n\nwhat was meant was that the buyer would pay one percent initially and pay 99 percent on\n\ncompletion. There and then Gary Lee called Philip Chan and put the proposition to him.\n\nPhilip Chan asked for time to speak with his partners. Ten minutes later Gary Lee called\n\nPhilip Chan again and the latter then said ‘Okay we will go through with that’.48. Gary Lee was asked whether the\n\nagreement that he discussed with Philip Chan over the telephone about the one percent\n\ndeposit and the 99 percent completion payment required Amethyst to make another payment of\n\n$24,000 as the deposit. His response was a flat ‘No’. I asked him why not and\n\nhis reply was a rather evasive ‘Because Mr Bhojraj told me, you bring this to the\n\nbuyer, get the lawyer to talk to me and specify who the lawyer is’. I asked again why\n\nAmethyst was not required to pay the one percent deposit. This time the reply was ‘I\n\nwasn’t very clear in my mind at that time but all that Sam said to me was get the\n\nbuyer to specify a lawyer and write to me’. Gary Lee pinpointed this conversation as\n\nhaving taken place after the issue of the Agreement in the lawyer’s office. He said\n\nthat at this time Sam Bhojraj had also told him that Philip Chan must pay the 99 percent\n\nupon completion.49. Then followed a significant piece of\n\nevidence. I will set out the questions and answers in full.Q The $24,000 deposit that is stated in\n\n  the agreement would it then be taken to be paid by the option fee paid by Amethyst?A I have 2 interpretations here during\n\n  that time.Q I am talking about the time when you and\n\n  Philip were talking before you went to the lawyers’ office. Was it understood by you,\n\n  Philip and Mr Bhojraj at that time that the 1% deposit was to be treated as paid by\n\n  Amethyst option fee?A I wasn’t sure.CtWhat did you tell Philip?A I said if supposing the seller were to\n\n  issue you a sale and purchase agreement and you only paid 1% and not more than that and\n\n  you paid 99% on completion, what would you say. Philip and I speak in Hokkien. He said he\n\n  would discuss with his partners.CtWhat did he ask you about the\n\n  1%?A He said are you sure. I said that I\n\n  would speak to Mr Bhojraj. Mr Bhojraj confirmed he would issue the sale and purchase\n\n  agreement taking the 1% and 99% later.…Q As far as Philip was concerned, what was\n\n  he to pay for the deposit?A $24,000.Q When was he supposed to make this\n\n  payment?A I have 2 interpretations. One of which\n\n  was that Philip could through his lawyer pay to Mr Bhojraj and that’s why Mr Bhojraj\n\n  emphasised to me again and again to get the lawyer’s name. The other one that I\n\n  thought was that the $24,000 could come from the option money that was forfeited.Q At the time when you told Philip about\n\n  plaintiffs’ proposal you were not sure about what the position was because you had 2\n\n  interpretations.A Yes.Q You were not clear because Mr Bhojraj\n\n  did not make it clear to you how this deposit was supposed to be paid.A Yes.Q Philip could have understood, because of\n\n  your lack of clarity on the deposit, that it was your 2ndinterpretation that\n\n  was agreed, that it is the option fee be treated as the deposit.A Could be.’50. In subsequent testimony, Gary Lee\n\nconfirmed that from the things he had told Philip Chan, the latter may have understood\n\nthat although the option fee had been forfeited, the new arrangement had revived the\n\noption fee to be used as the deposit. He also agreed that on 23 December Sam Bhojraj did\n\nnot tell him that he must collect a deposit of $24,000 on the signing of the Agreement.51. Gary Lee confirmed that the plaintiffs\n\nwere desperate to sell the property on 23 December. By desperate he meant that they were\n\nwilling to sell it to anyone. He was aware that the plaintiffs were late in their\n\ncompletion of the purchase of the property and Sam Bhojraj told him that this was why they\n\nwere desperate to sell it. He also informed Gary Lee that the plaintiffs needed a sale\n\nagreement to help them get financing to complete the purchase.52. When Sam Bhojraj first handed over the\n\nAgreement to the agent to convey to the defendants, he did not give the latter any time\n\nlimit for its signing and redelivery. It was only a few hours later that Sam Bhojraj said\n\nthat the Agreement had to be returned on the same day. It was quite late at night, at\n\nabout 10pm that this information was conveyed to Gary Lee. This was the first time the\n\ntime limit was mentioned. About an hour later, Sam Bhojraj repeated this instruction to\n\nGary Lee. The witness was not quite clear in his evidence on this point because at first\n\nhe indicated that another time limit was given to him at 11pm but subsequently he said\n\nthat during the 11pm conversation he was just told to get the defendants to sign and\n\nreturn the document as soon as he could and no specific time limit was imposed. He was\n\nclear, however, that throughout 23 December, Sam Bhojraj did not also mention to him that\n\nhe had to collect a deposit from the defendants at the time when he gave them the signed\n\ncopy of the Agreement.53. Gary Lee maintained that the Agreement\n\nwas not signed by the defendants on 23 December and that he was not able to meet them that\n\nday. He maintained that immediately the Agreement was in his hand, he called Philip Chan\n\nand told him the document was ready for signing. Philip Chan then said he would speak to\n\nhis partners and call the agent back when they were ready to meet the latter. He spoke to\n\nPhilip Chan several times that day and every time he was given a similar reply.54. Gary Lee’s evidence on what\n\nhappened on 23 December was, in portions, incoherent. He was obviously having great\n\ndifficulty in trying to account for the non-signing of the Agreement that day. Take this\n\npassage from his evidence where he was talking about what had happened that night. He\n\nsaid:‘Subsequently at around 10pm, Mr\n\n  Bhojraj said if the sale and purchase was not signed by him the deal should be off. Then I\n\n  told Philip about it ie the deal was off (about 10pm also) and Philip said I understand\n\n  that. In my mind, however, I was not sure whether that was what Mr Bhojraj wanted ie for\n\n  the deal to be off. So I told Philip, I said it could be on, it could be off, so you get\n\n  it signed and lawyer will write about it and that will solidify it. Philip said okay. I\n\n  asked him when I could see him and he said he would discuss with his partner.’55. Gary Lee went on to say that he had a\n\nseries of conversations with Sam Bhojraj between 11.05pm and shortly after midnight of 23\n\nDecember. In the final conversation they agreed to talk again the next day. The next\n\nmorning, he was finally able to arrange to see the defendants for the signing of the\n\nAgreement. Up to the time the Agreement was signed on 24 December, Sam Bhojraj did not\n\ntell him that the deal was off and Gary Lee’s understanding based on his final\n\nconversation with Sam Bhojraj was that the deal was still on.56. There was also some evidence given on\n\ntwo meetings in early 2000 between Gary Lee and the defendants and their friends. One\n\nmeeting took place at the office of one Mike Kalwani who was financing the\n\ndefendants’ proposed development of the property. According to Gary Lee, he went to\n\nthat meeting at Sam Bhojraj’s suggestion in order to try and settle the\n\ndefendants’ claim. However, this was impossible as the defendants wanted $1 million\n\nto be paid to them in settlement.57. The other occasion was when Gary Lee\n\nattended a meeting at the defendants’ solicitors’ office. There a statement was\n\ntaken from him. When it came to the point, however, he refused to sign it. His position\n\nwas that the statement contained untruths and he could not sign it. It was put to him that\n\nhe had demanded $50,000 for his signature and it was only when this demand was rejected\n\nthat he had refused to sign the statement. Gary Lee denied this suggestion.(ii) The defendants’ story: (a) Leow\n\nKoon Huat Danny58. In the affidavit which Danny Leow\n\nfiled as his evidence-in-chief, he first set out the circumstances in which the option was\n\ngranted to Amethyst. He also stated that ALP had acted for both the plaintiffs and\n\nAmethyst in the matter and exhibited a copy of a commission agreement between ALP and\n\nAmethyst whereby Amethyst had agreed to pay ALP a brokerage fee of $5,000 for the\n\nbrokerage service rendered in Amethyst’s purchase of the property. He went on to\n\nstate that as Amethyst had assigned its option to the defendants, it was understood that\n\nthis commission would be paid by the defendants upon the completion of the purchase.59. According to him, some time on 22\n\nDecember 1999 and before the expiry of the deadline for the exercise of the option, the\n\ndefendants were informed by ALP acting for and on behalf of the plaintiffs that the option\n\ncould be exercised by a party other than Amethyst and that the plaintiffs had agreed to\n\nvary the terms of the option in that the one percent option fee would be treated as full\n\nand sufficient consideration for a binding contract and that the plaintiffs were waiving\n\ntheir rights to the balance ten percent.60. Amethyst then assigned the option to\n\nthe defendants and authorised the latter to exercise it. On behalf of the defendants, the\n\nwitness signed the Acceptance Copy and the entire option was handed to ALP for its onward\n\ntransmission to the plaintiffs. The defendants were informed that the variation to the\n\nterms of the sale and purchase contract would be reduced to writing in a freshly issued\n\nsale and purchase agreement to be prepared by the plaintiffs’ solicitors.61. On 23 December 1999, ALP handed Danny\n\nLeow two sets of the Agreement duly signed by Sam Bhojraj. Danny Leow signed both sets and\n\non the same day returned one set to ALP for its onward transmission to the plaintiffs. His\n\nexecution was witnessed by Gary Lee. Gary Lee did not at any time tell him that the\n\nAgreement must be signed and returned on the same day nor was he at any time thereafter\n\ninformed by either Gary Lee or the plaintiffs that the Agreement was null and void.62. After the conclusion of the Agreement,\n\nthe defendants approached a firm of solicitors to act on their behalf in the purchase. The\n\nsolicitor in charge of the matter was, however, busy with his personal matters and did not\n\ndo any work on the file. The matter was subsequently transferred to another law firm,\n\nMessrs Lourdes Chen & Lee, which conducted a title search and then lodged a caveat\n\nover the property on behalf of the defendants. The delay by the original solicitor and the\n\nchange of solicitors explained the delay in the lodging of the caveat. Danny Leow\n\nemphasised that the defendants were genuinely interested in acquiring the property in\n\norder to redevelop the same and had engaged a firm of architects to produce drawings for a\n\npair of three-storey semi-detached houses to be built on the property. They had also\n\nobtained provisional permission from the Urban Redevelopment Authority for this project.63. Under cross-examination, Danny Leow\n\nexplained the relationship between the defendants and other persons whose names came up in\n\nthe action. One Alan Lim Kwee Kian was mentioned as a shareholder in the defendant company\n\nthough the only directors of it are Danny Leow and his wife. There is no direct\n\nrelationship between the defendants and Amethyst. Rather, Philip Chan and Danny Leow are\n\nboth directors of two other companies that are involved in the real estate investment\n\nbusiness. Further, Danny Leow had previously been in joint ventures with Mike Kalwani in\n\nwhich the formers role had been to purchase properties whilst the latter financed the\n\ndevelopment of such properties. At some stage after obtaining the agreement for the\n\npurchase of this property, Danny Leow also procured Mike Kalwani’s involvement in the\n\ndevelopment project as the sole financier.64. The Agreement was first discussed\n\nbetween the defendants as purchaser and the plaintiffs as vendor on 22 December when they\n\nwere supposed to be preparing for the exercise of the option to purchase the property.\n\nDiscussions were held amongst Philip Chan, Alan Lim and Danny Leow and it was the last of\n\nthese who suggested that the defendant company should be the purchaser. Danny Leow pointed\n\nout that the defendants were an investment company holding a Land Dealing Unit permit\n\nenabling it to purchase landed property whilst Amethyst was a builder and did not have\n\nsuch a permit available. At that stage, Mike Kalwani was not involved, as the parties had\n\nnot decided whether they were going to on-sell or redevelop the property.65. On 22 December, Danny Leow and his\n\nassociates were undecided about whether to exercise the option because Philip Chan had not\n\nbeen able to secure a bank loan to finance the purchase. That morning, therefore, nothing\n\nwas done to exercise it. In the early afternoon, Danny Leow received a call from Philip\n\nChan who told him that the agent had offered to allow them to exercise the option without\n\nhaving to pay the remaining nine percent of the price as the balance of the deposit. He\n\nwas told that the plaintiffs had agreed to a sale and purchase agreement with the\n\ndefendants without payment of the nine percent or any payment at all. Amethyst then\n\nassigned the option to the defendants and the Acceptance Copy was signed by Alan Lim on\n\nDanny Leow’s behalf. The witness asserted that the statement in his affidavit that he\n\nhad signed the Acceptance Copy was true because he had given Alan Lim an instruction to\n\nsign the document on his behalf and he had made that statement in order to take\n\nresponsibility for the signature. Danny Leow confirmed that on 22 December he did not\n\nspeak directly to Gary Lee or the plaintiffs and that all information that he had on the\n\noffer made by the plaintiffs had come from Philip Chan.66. The witness reasserted during\n\ncross-examination that the Agreement had been signed by him on 23 December at about noon.\n\nThe signing took place at the car park at Toa Payoh Stadium and at that time Philip Chan\n\nand Alan Lim were also present. When the Agreement was given to him, Danny Leow saw it had\n\nbeen dated 23 December. He also noted that it had been signed by the plaintiffs. He did\n\nnot read the Agreement but only glanced through it. He was told by the agent that\n\neverything was in order.67. Danny Leow was questioned about the\n\nappointment of solicitors for the defendants. He stated that originally Amethyst had\n\nappointed its own solicitor to handle the purchase but when in early January he went to\n\nsee that lawyer he found the latter to be tied up with personal matters. He was not\n\ncomfortable with the solicitor’s ability to handle the purchase. This on the very\n\nsame day he decided to change solicitors and instructed Lourdes Chen & Lee instead. It\n\nshould be noted that by this time the defendants had discovered that Sea Union had lodged\n\na competing caveat against the property. Danny Leow admitted that before his visit in\n\nJanuary 2000, the defendants had not given the first set of solicitors any instructions on\n\nthe transaction and that this firm did not have conduct of the matter for the defendants\n\nat all. He explained that he had not gone to see the lawyer before early January because\n\nhe assumed the matter was being handed by Amethyst’s solicitors and that Philip Chan\n\nwould ask those solicitors to continue with the transaction. It was put to him that the\n\ndefendants had not been serious purchasers of the property and that when they accidentally\n\ndiscovered the existence of the competing caveat they saw an opportunity to cash in. Danny\n\nLeow denied this suggestion.68. He confirmed that the new law firm\n\nLourdes Chen & Lee were instructed on 10 January 2000 but could only explain the nine\n\nday lapse before the firm lodged the caveat on behalf of the defendants by stating that\n\nthe lawyers had delayed the lodgement. He also asserted that it was a coincidence that the\n\ndefendants’ application for approval to build a pair of semi-detached houses on the\n\nproperty was also lodged on 19 January. He did not agree that as soon as the defendants\n\nfound out about the Sea Union caveat they had proceeded to do everything in order to lay a\n\nfoundation for a claim against the plaintiffs for vast damages or that the defendants had\n\nnot had the financial resources to contemplate such a purchase.69. Danny Leow confirmed that at a meeting\n\nat Mike Kalwani’s office at Peninsula Plaza the latter had demanded that the\n\nplaintiffs pay the defendants $1 million to settle the matter. He did not know why that\n\namount was demanded and conceded that there was no basis for making it. Subsequently, in\n\nre-examination, he elaborated that if the defendants’ purchase and redevelopment of\n\nthe property went ahead as planned, they would incur costs of around $3.5 million\n\n(including $800,000 in construction cost). The defendants had also estimated that they\n\nwould be able to sell each of the pair of semi-detached houses for $2.3 million giving\n\nthem a gross income of $4.6 million and therefore about $1 million in profit. Danny Leow\n\nbelieved that that was the reason why Mike Kalwani had demanded $1 million in damages.70. The witness confirmed that he had been\n\npresent at the meeting held at the premises of the defendants’ new solicitors, Messrs\n\nFong & Partners, where Gary Lee had given a statement. He averred that Gary Lee had\n\nbeen asked to tell the truth. No threats had been made and the only reason why this\n\nstatement had not been signed was because Gary Lee had wanted $50,000 which the defendants\n\nhad refused to pay.(b) Philip Chan71. In Philip Chan’s affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief, he stated that on 22 December 1999, Gary Lee telephoned him to enquire\n\nwhether Amethyst intended to exercise the option and his reply was that they might not.\n\nGary Lee telephoned again and told him that the plaintiffs were agreeable to Amethyst\n\nproceeding with the option/purchase of the property without requiring payment of the\n\nbalance ten percent of the sale price and that Amethyst’s nominee could exercise the\n\noption. When he asked why the plaintiffs were prepared to do this, the reply was that they\n\nneeded to have a sale agreement in respect of the property in order to get financing from\n\nthe bank. Philip Chan told Gary Lee that he would discuss the offer with his associates\n\nand later, when Gary Lee telephoned him for the third time, he informed Gary Lee of their\n\nacceptance and that the defendants would replace Amethyst as the purchaser.72. He continued that he had met Gary Lee\n\non the evening of 22 December at his work site in Toa Payoh. He handed to Gary Lee the\n\noption with the Acceptance Copy executed by the defendants and Amethyst’s letter\n\nauthorising the defendants to exercise the option. As the option provided that it was to\n\nbe exercised by payment of the balance ten percent of the sale price, it was agreed that\n\nGary Lee would arrange for a fresh sale and purchase agreement to be prepared and signed\n\nby the plaintiffs and the defendants to reflect the variations agreed to. He then went on\n\nto give evidence similar to that of Danny Leow regarding the signing of the agreement on\n\nthe morning of 23 December. It should be noted that Gary Lee agreed the Acceptance Copy\n\nand Amethyst’s letter of authority had been handed to him by Philip Chan although he\n\nasserted this had happened on 24 December and not on 22 December.73. Philip Chan agreed that neither\n\nAmethyst nor the defendants had returned the option duly accepted to the plaintiffs’\n\nlawyers by 4pm on 22 December as stipulated by the terms of the document. I asked whether\n\nthat meant that the option money was forfeited. His reply was no because he had been told\n\nby Gary Lee that the agent would come and collect the option with a new condition that\n\nonly one percent would be needed to exercise it and the $24,000 would be the deposit as\n\nstated in the fresh agreement. He explained that he handed over the Acceptance Copy to\n\nGary Lee because Gary Lee had asked him for it in order to show the plaintiffs that the\n\ndefendants intended to purchase the property.74. Philip Chan maintained under\n\ncross-examination that he had met Gary Lee on 23 December at around 11am in the company of\n\nDanny Leow and Alan Lim. This was the occasion when the Agreement was signed. He denied\n\nGary Lee’s allegation that he had had numerous conversations with the latter on the\n\nevening of 23 December. He was definite that the signing of the Agreement took place on 23\n\nDecember and not 24 December because the latter date was Christmas Eve.75. Philip Chan was asked why Amethyst had\n\nignored the plaintiffs’ solicitors’ letter of 30 December. By this letter, the\n\nplaintiffs had put forward the position that Amethyst had allowed the option given to it\n\nby the plaintiffs to lapse without exercising it in the specified manner. The letter went\n\non to state that the option fee of $24,000 had accordingly been forfeited to the\n\nplaintiffs and that neither party would have any claim or lien on the property. It was\n\nsuggested to him that the letter reflected a position that was the opposite of that which\n\nhe had agreed with Gary Lee. Philip Chan maintained that he had not considered the letter\n\nto be important. It had been sent to him only by fax seven days after the agreement had\n\nbeen signed and whilst it sounded strange to him that the plaintiffs were asserting that\n\nthe option money had been forfeited, he did not act on it as he was very busy trying to\n\ncomplete his project at Toa Payoh.(c) Other witnesses76. Evidence for the defendants was also\n\ngiven by Mike Kalwani (officially Bharat Dharmadas Kalwani) and Mrs Phyllis Fong (Tan Guat\n\nNeo, Phyllis), the defendants’ solicitor. I need not recount their evidence at this\n\nstage since neither of them was involved in the events of the 22, 23 and 24 December 1999\n\nexcept to say that Mike Kalwani confirmed the story told by both Danny Leow and Philip\n\nChan that Gary Lee had refused to sign the statement taken from him at Mrs Fong’s\n\noffice because the defendants were not willing to pay him $50,000. Mrs Fong was not\n\npresent when this refusal took place. She confirmed, however, that the statement had been\n\ngiven voluntarily by Gary Lee to her assistant in her presence at her office and that he\n\nhad read over the first draft and made minor corrections to it. Thereafter he had asked\n\nher to leave the room because he wanted to talk to Danny Leow and his associates\n\nprivately. When she returned to the room she was told that Gary Lee had refused to sign\n\nthe document.77. I note here for completeness that the\n\nprepared statement gave an account of the events leading up to the signing of the\n\nAgreement which reflected the defendants’ version of events. It contained an averment\n\nby Gary Lee that he had been instructed by Sam Bhojraj on 22 December that the option\n\ncould be exercised by another party and then converted to a sale and purchase agreement\n\nwith the option fee being used as the consideration for the sale and purchase agreement.\n\nHe also said in the statement that the purchasers had signed the Agreement on 23 December\n\nand after this was done he had informed the plaintiffs of the signing.Findings of fact78. I find, on the evidence, that by 22\n\nDecember 1999, the plaintiffs were desperate to have a concluded contract for the sub-sale\n\nof the property. This was because they were already late in completing their own purchase\n\nfrom Lian Huah Electrical Engineering Pte Ltd and, having been served with a 21 day notice\n\non 21 December, were facing not only payment of interest for late completion but also the\n\nchance of being sued for damages if they were not able to complete within the 21 days. The\n\nnon-completion must have been due to the plaintiffs’ inability to raise sufficient\n\nfinance as they did not, up to 21 December, have evidence of a concrete sub-sale of the\n\nproperty.79. I do not accept Sam Bhojraj’s\n\ntestimony that there was no difficulty in him procuring a loan when he wanted it and that\n\nthe only difference that having a sub-sale would make would be in the quantum of the loan.\n\nEven if this assertion was true, the non-completion of their own purchase must have meant\n\nthat the loan quantum that was available to the plaintiffs (approximately 60 percent of\n\nthe purchase price) in the absence of a confirmed sub-sale would not have provided them\n\nwith sufficient funds to pay the 90 percent of the price due on completion.80. In those circumstances, the plaintiffs\n\nwere extremely anxious that the option be exercised by Amethyst. I hold that when it\n\nbecame clear to the plaintiffs some time in the late afternoon of 22 December that\n\nAmethyst was not proceeding, Sam Bhojraj must have recognised the possibility that\n\nAmethyst was being held back by an inability to come up with the $218,000 required for the\n\nexercise of the option. He was also all too aware of the plaintiffs’ pressing need\n\nfor a sale contract in order to obtain the maximum possible financing. The plaintiffs\n\nadmitted that he then put a proposition to Gary Lee for the latter’s onward\n\ntransmission to Amethyst.81. I hold that the proposition put\n\nforward was that notwithstanding the lapse of the option, the plaintiffs were prepared to\n\nsell the property to Amethyst at the previously agreed price but on altered payment terms.\n\nInstead of having to pay a deposit of ten percent, Amethyst would only have to pay a\n\ndeposit of one percent and the remaining 99 percent of the purchase price would be payable\n\non completion. Further, the one percent deposit would be taken as having been satisfied by\n\nthe payment of the option money in October 1999. The quid pro quo for this arrangement was\n\nthat Amethyst would have to enter into a sale contract rather than be granted a new option\n\nso that there would be an immediately binding agreement which the plaintiffs would be able\n\nto show to their bankers. In my judgment, Sam Bhojraj would have realised at the time that\n\neven his new proposition would not have been attractive to Amethyst if he had told them\n\nthat he was forfeiting the option fee and that for the new arrangement they would have to\n\npay another $24,200 in cash as the initial deposit.82. Further, the plaintiffs’ official\n\nversion ie that the terms of the new arrangement called for an immediate payment of\n\n$24,200 is not supported by the evidence of Gary Lee. This was the person who had to\n\nconvey that information to Amethyst on the plaintiffs’ behalf. As shown by the\n\nextensive quotations from his evidence set out in para 49, Gary Lee did not convey such a\n\nterm to Philip Chan. He should have done so as he was acting as the plaintiffs’ agent\n\nin putting forward the proposals. Gary Lee sought to explain the omission to properly\n\nconvey the proposition by saying that at the time he spoke to Philip Chan he thought that\n\ntwo interpretations could be given to the term relating to the one percent deposit. Due to\n\nhis confusion on the matter, he did not clearly notify Philip Chan of the payment\n\nrequirement. I find this evidence incredible.83. I do not accept that Gary Lee had two\n\ninterpretations of the term. He knew what the plaintiffs wanted to propose and that was\n\nthat the deposit would be met by the option fee even though that option fee was slightly\n\nshort of one percent of the purchase price. That is the proposal that he put forward to\n\nPhilip Chan. He could not admit it in court because that would undermine the\n\nplaintiffs’ case but on the other hand he was not willing to lie outright and say\n\nthat he had told Philip Chan that the deposit had to be paid in cash when the agreement\n\nwas signed. The reluctance to tell such an outright lie on this aspect (a reluctance which\n\nwas not reflected in some other aspects of his evidence) was probably because if he had\n\ntold it he would then have had to explain why he had not collected the deposit at the time\n\nthe defendants signed the Agreement and had yet left one completed copy of the Agreement\n\nwith them.84. Further evidence of the\n\nplaintiffs’ intention may be garnered from the Agreement itself. This provided for\n\n$24,000 to be the quantum of the deposit. That figure was identical to the option fee. It\n\nwas not the equivalent of one percent of the purchase price. That would have been $24,200.\n\nIf the plaintiffs had been expecting to collect one percent on the signing of the\n\nAgreement they would surely have drafted the clause using the figure of $24,200. The only\n\nreason they used $24,000 as the deposit was that they already had this amount.85. The new proposition was put to Philip\n\nChan in the late afternoon or the evening of 22 December. As he testified, he consulted\n\nwith his associates and having done so, informed Gary Lee that he and they were willing to\n\naccept this proposition on the basis that the buyer would be the defendants rather than\n\nAmethyst. Although the plaintiffs had contemplated entering into the new arrangement with\n\nAmethyst, when the defendants’ name was put forward and Sam Bhojraj was told by Gary\n\nLee that the defendants were associated with Amethyst, he accepted them as the buyer\n\nthough he did require some evidence of a commitment on the defendants’ part and this\n\nwas the reason why the defendants signed the Acceptance Copy of the option even though it\n\nhad expired. In the desperate situation in which the plaintiffs found themselves, they\n\nwere happy to have someone willing to enter a legally binding contract with them and were\n\nnot fussy about who it was.86. I hold that all these events happened\n\non 22 December. I do not accept Gary Lee’s and Sam Bhojraj’s testimony that it\n\nwas only on 23 December that Philip Chan conveyed the defendants’ agreement to buy to\n\nthe plaintiffs. There were several inconsistencies in the evidence of the plaintiffs’\n\nwitnesses on this point. For example, Sam Bhojraj himself pinpointed three different times\n\non 23 December as being the times when he was told that the defendants rather than\n\nAmethyst were the buyers. First, he said that he was told that over the telephone on the\n\nmorning of 23 December. Next he said that he was told that by Gary Lee when the latter was\n\nin his office that morning and finally he asserted that it was only when he was in his\n\nlawyer’s office drawing up the agreement that he learnt the name of the purchaser.\n\nAdditionally, there is concrete supporting evidence for 22 December in the form of the\n\ndate of Amethyst’s letter of authorisation and the date inserted in the Acceptance\n\nCopy. Both these were dated 22 December and I see no reason why the defendants and\n\nAmethyst would, if they had made their decision to buy in the defendants’ name only\n\non 23 December, have backdated those documents since they knew in any case that the\n\ncontract would be evidenced by the new Agreement and not by the exercised option.87. I accept that on the morning of 23\n\nDecember, Sam Bhojraj and Gary Lee proceeded to the plaintiffs’ solicitors’\n\noffice for the purpose of having a sale and purchase agreement between the plaintiffs as\n\nvendors and the defendants as purchasers drawn up. This visit must have been arranged\n\nbetween the two men some time on 22 December after Philip Chan had indicated the\n\ndefendants’ acceptance of the plaintiffs’ new proposition. Once the Agreement\n\nwas ready, Sam Bhojraj signed it on behalf of the plaintiffs and handed it to Gary Lee. In\n\nmy judgment, the only instruction given to Gary Lee at that time was to take the documents\n\nto the defendants, have them sign both and bring back one signed copy for the\n\nplaintiffs’ further action. The very fact that Sam Bhojraj signed and dated the\n\nAgreement before handing it to Gary Lee shows that at the time he was quite confident that\n\nthe defendants had accepted the plaintiffs’ proposition and that he was willing to\n\ncommit the plaintiffs to a legal contract with the defendants. If he had been at all\n\nunsure of their reaction or was not willing to commit the plaintiffs until the deposit was\n\npaid, he would not have signed the sale and purchase agreement. In fact by that time he\n\nhad most probably seen the signed Acceptance Copy and that was why he was willing to draw\n\nup and pre-sign the Agreement.88. I do not accept that Gary Lee was, as\n\nasserted by the plaintiffs, instructed to collect the one percent deposit referred to in\n\nthe Agreement. Here, I note that Gary Lee himself at more than one point of his testimony,\n\nindicated that no such instruction had been given and that he had no idea that he was\n\nsupposed to collect any cash from the defendants. At one stage, following the\n\nplaintiffs’ line that the one percent deposit was to be paid at about the time of the\n\nsigning, Gary Lee indicated that he expected the defendants’ lawyers to make this\n\npayment to the plaintiffs’ lawyers. He was certain that he himself was not supposed\n\nto receive the money.89. I do not accept either that Gary Lee\n\nwas instructed by the plaintiffs that the Agreement had to be signed by the defendants on\n\nthat same day, 23 December, or else the plaintiffs would no longer be willing to sell the\n\nproperty to the defendants on the proposed terms. In this respect, there was a major\n\ninconsistency between the evidence given by Sam Bhojraj and that of Gary Lee. The former\n\nasserted that he told Gary Lee, at the time the documents were handed over at the\n\nsolicitors’ office, that if he did not get them back with the cheque on the same day\n\nhe would take it that the defendants had no further interest in the property. Gary Lee,\n\nhowever, stated that no such instruction was given to him when he first received the\n\ndocuments and it was only much later that Sam Bhojraj issued those instructions.90. I find that once Gary Lee had the\n\ndocuments he proceeded straight to Philip Chan’s office in Toa Payoh where he met\n\nDanny Leow and Alan Lim as well and procured the defendants’ signature of the\n\nAgreement. I do not accept the plaintiffs’ version that the defendants were elusive\n\nand undecided on 23 December and that despite chasing them the whole day, Gary Lee could\n\nnot get an acceptance from them until the morning of 24 December. Even on the\n\nplaintiffs’ story, Philip Chan had agreed, on the defendants’ behalf, to the\n\nplaintiffs’ proposition on the morning of 23 December before the plaintiffs’\n\nvisit to the solicitors’ office. Having agreed to the purchase in the morning, there\n\nwas no reason for the defendants not to sign the Agreement immediately. If Gary Lee had\n\nsaid that the Agreement was not signed on the same day because Danny Leow was busy and\n\nPhilip Chan could not procure his attendance at a convenient location, that would have\n\nbeen more believable than the story actually put forth which was that after accepting the\n\ndeal the defendants had second thoughts and Gary Lee had to keep asking whether they were\n\nstill agreeable to it and he could see them. It should be noted that no independent\n\nevidence (such as telephone records) was put forward of all the numerous calls that had\n\npurportedly taken place between Gary Lee and Philip Chan throughout 23 December or of the\n\nsimilarly numerous telephone calls between Sam Bhojraj and Gary Lee up to the early hours\n\nof 24 December.91. Even if I were disposed to accept the\n\nplaintiffs’ version that the Agreement was not signed until 24 December, I would have\n\nheld that at the time of its signing the plaintiffs had not withdrawn their offer to the\n\ndefendants. This was because Sam Bhojraj admitted that in his last telephone conversation\n\nwith Gary Lee after midnight of 23 December, he had left the matter open. He also\n\nconfirmed that he had not told Gary Lee on the morning of 24 December that the deal was\n\noff until around noon of that day although later on he changed this evidence and said he\n\nhad told Gary Lee this at about 11am. Sam Bhojraj’s evidence on this point is\n\nunreliable. He twisted and turned too much in his effort to establish that the defendants\n\nwere late. It should be noted also that Gary Lee averred that up to the time he procured\n\nthe defendants’ signature at noon on 24 December, he had not been told by the\n\nplaintiffs that they had withdrawn their offer. Gary Lee was called as the\n\nplaintiffs’ witness and thus this evidence is all the more damaging to the\n\nplaintiffs’ case.92. It would have been noted from the\n\nholdings above that where there has been a discrepancy between the story told by the\n\nplaintiffs and that told by the defendants, I have preferred the defendants’ version\n\nof events. I am aware that the defendants’ witnesses have not been totally consistent\n\nwith each other and on occasion they were caught out in lies, for example, Danny\n\nLeow’s initial attempt to pass off the signature on the Acceptance Copy as his.\n\nOverall, however, their evidence was consistent and probable and the flaws in it are more\n\nlikely to have been caused by lapses in memory than by deliberate attempts to embroider\n\ntheir case.93. The same could not be said of the\n\nevidence given by Sam Bhojraj and Gary Lee. Both these persons changed their accounts to\n\nsuit the plaintiffs’ case and to fill up the gaps that became apparent as\n\ncross-examination proceeded. Gary Lee was the more obvious liar but Sam Bhojraj was\n\nequally at fault. Further, he tried to elicit untruthful evidence (but evidence that would\n\nbe helpful to the plaintiffs) by paying Gary Lee more than the agreed commission in return\n\nfor the letter of 22 January. Sam Bhojraj could not explain to my satisfaction why the fee\n\nof $5,000 for a successful sale had turned into $10,000 for an aborted sale which was\n\nboding to become a major legal problem for the plaintiffs. In my judgment, the extra\n\n$5,000 was paid to Gary Lee to bring him squarely into the plaintiffs’ camp for the\n\npurposes of the case. It was perhaps fortunate for the plaintiffs that the defendants were\n\nnot equally willing to pay for evidence as if they had been the plaintiffs would have\n\ndiscovered that once bought, Gary Lee did not stay bought but was still willing to sell\n\nhis testimony to a higher bidder.Legal consequences of findings of factStatus of option94. The first issue is the status of the\n\nAmethyst option after 4pm on 22 December. That was an offer which had to be accepted in a\n\nstipulated manner by a stipulated date. If either of the stipulations was not met, then\n\nthe offer lapsed and the option money was forfeited to the plaintiffs. In the event,\n\nneither stipulation was met and therefore on its face, at 4pm on 22 December the option\n\ncame to an end. The defendants contended, however, that it continued to exist because its\n\nterms were varied by the proposition which the plaintiffs made to them that day ie that\n\nthe option could be exercised without requiring payment of a deposit of ten percent of the\n\npurchase price as long as the parties entered into a sale and purchase contract\n\nstraightaway and that the $24,000 paid as option fee would serve as the deposit required\n\nunder such contract.95. The plaintiffs argued that in law\n\nthere could be no such variation because there was no written document evidencing the\n\nsame. They relied on the legal requirement that to be valid, contracts for the sale of an\n\ninterest in land must be evidenced in writing and the ancillary rule that variations of\n\nsuch contracts must also be written. They went on to submit that oral evidence of the\n\nvariation of the option was not admissible under s 94 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97). This\n\nsection provides that, except in certain circumstances, when the terms of a contract which\n\nis required by law to be in writing have been proved by the admission of the written\n\ndocument evidencing the contract, no evidence of any oral agreement or statement can be\n\nadmitted as between the parties to such instrument for the purpose of contradicting,\n\nvarying, adding to or subtracting from its terms.96. I accept the plaintiffs’ argument\n\non this point. I do not think that the option was varied. Even if the plaintiffs’\n\nintention at the time were to procure a variation of the option, the oral evidence to that\n\neffect would not be admissible under s 94 of the Evidence Act. In any case, in my\n\njudgment, the plaintiffs had no intention of varying the option. That brings us to the\n\nnext issue which is what the plaintiffs’ new proposition was.Is the Agreement a variation of the\n\noption?97. In my view, what in fact happened was\n\nthat once it was clear to the plaintiffs that Amethyst would not be exercising the option\n\nin accordance with its terms, the plaintiffs decided to forget about the option altogether\n\nand put forward a new proposal. This proposal which was addressed to Amethyst was that\n\nprovided Amethyst was willing to enter into a sale and purchase agreement with the\n\nplaintiffs immediately, the plaintiffs would sell the property to Amethyst at $2,420,000\n\nwith this price being paid in two instalments: $24,000 on signing of the contract (to be\n\ntreated as satisfied by the payment of the option fee) and the balance on completion.98. Sam Bhojraj was emphatic that what he\n\nwanted was to proceed to a sale and purchase agreement straightaway. His stand and that\n\nrepeated by the plaintiffs in their submissions was that the Amethyst option and the\n\nAgreement were two entirely different contracts. He did not accept that the Agreement was\n\na variation of the option. I agree. The proposal which Gary Lee put forward was intended\n\nfor Amethyst. In the event Amethyst did not accept the proposal but put forward a counter\n\noffer that the defendants would be the purchaser. The plaintiffs could have refused at\n\nthis point. They did not do so because they were desperate to sell and also because there\n\nwas going to be an immediate contractual relationship between them and the new buyer which\n\nwas distinct from the option. They therefore accepted the defendants as the buyer and drew\n\nup the Agreement to reflect this.99. If the Agreement were to be considered\n\na valid contract, it would be a valid contract which stands on its own independent and\n\napart from the option which lapsed. In law, the Agreement cannot function as a variation\n\nof the option. First, the Agreement is between the plaintiffs and the defendants whereas\n\nif there had been a valid variation of the option that variation would have existed\n\nbetween the plaintiffs and Amethyst to whom the plaintiffs were addressing their\n\nproposals. Secondly, there are differences between the terms of the Agreement and the\n\nterms of the sale contract that would have arisen had the option been exercised. The\n\ndifference in the terms is substantial and not limited to the difference in the mode of\n\npayment. Further, these different terms were not put forward to Philip Chan when the\n\nlapsing of the option was discussed and therefore had not been accepted by the defendants\n\nat the time Philip Chan conveyed their willingness to purchase the property on the new\n\nbasis. The defendants did of course accept all the terms of the Agreement when they signed\n\nit but this would be acceptance of those terms as contained in a new and separate contract\n\nand not an acceptance of a varied option.100. In my judgment, the purported signing\n\nof the Acceptance Copy of the Amethyst option by the defendants had no legal effect as\n\nthere is no evidence of a valid variation whereby that signature alone would constitute a\n\nvalid exercise of the option when the other stipulations were not met. In any case, by the\n\ntime the defendants signed the option, the plaintiffs had by their offer made through Gary\n\nLee, made it quite clear that they did not want a sale and purchase agreement on the terms\n\ncontained in the option but wanted a new contract altogether.Validity of Agreement: (i) condition\n\nprecedent101. The next issue that arises is as to\n\nthe validity of the Agreement. The plaintiffs’ position is that the Agreement is a\n\nnullity on various legal grounds. First, they say that a condition precedent to its\n\nvalidity was not met. This was that it was not signed on 23 December as specified by them.\n\nIn view of the findings which I have made on the facts, this objection has no substance. I\n\nhave found that there was no condition that the Agreement had to be signed on 23 December\n\nin order to be valid and that even if there had been that condition was fulfilled.\n\nFurther, even if the Agreement was signed on 24 December despite the plaintiffs’\n\nimposition of the time limit, Sam Bhojraj had subsequently left the position open and had\n\nnot withdrawn Gary Lee’s authority to present the Agreement to the defendants for\n\nsigning until after the document had in fact been signed. By then it was too late to\n\nre-impose the condition.(ii) Consideration102. The next set of legal objections is\n\nbased on the non-payment of the deposit required by the Agreement. First, the plaintiffs\n\nrely on the well established principle that for a contract to be enforceable, it must be\n\nsupported by valid consideration. They contend that the Agreement was not supported by\n\nvalid consideration in that the sum of $24,000 was not paid to the plaintiffs by the\n\ndefendants as the defendants themselves openly admitted.103. There are two difficulties with the\n\nplaintiffs’ argument. The first is a factual one: that is that the plaintiffs\n\nthemselves had proposed to apply the option money in payment of the deposit due under the\n\noption. Knowing that the defendants had agreed to purchase the property on the basis of\n\nthat proposal, the plaintiffs cannot resile from it and argue that the defendants have not\n\ngiven consideration for the Agreement because they did not physically pay the deposit. The\n\nsecond problem is that in this case the deposit cannot be regarded as the consideration\n\nfor the Agreement. The consideration for the Agreement is the legally enforceable promise\n\nby the defendants to purchase the property at the price and on the terms set out in the\n\nAgreement. Just because the deposit may not have been paid in accordance with the terms of\n\nthe Agreement does not mean that there was a total failure of consideration resulting in\n\nthe Agreement being a nullity. Once signed the Agreement was an executory contract which\n\nbound both parties though not a cent may have changed hands at that stage.(iii) Was payment of the deposit a\n\ncondition precedent or a fundamental term?104. The plaintiffs’ alternative\n\nargument was that payment of the deposit was either a condition precedent to the validity\n\nof the Agreement or a fundamental term of it. In the former case, non-payment would result\n\nin the Agreement not taking effect as a valid contract whereas in the latter case\n\nnon-payment would be a breach of contract entitling the plaintiffs to treat the Agreement,\n\nalthough valid, as having been repudiated.105. The legal status of a deposit clause\n\nin an agreement for sale and purchase of property has been considered in several cases. InMyton Ltd v Schwab-Morris[1974] 1 All ER 326, an agreement for the underlease of a\n\nmaisonette provided by cl 2 that the defendant ‘shall on or before the signing hereof\n\npay ten percentum of the premium of 70,000 due on the said underlease as a deposit’\n\nto the plaintiff. This clause came up for consideration in proceedings between the\n\nplaintiff and the defendant after the defendant’s cheque in purported payment of the\n\ndeposit was dishonoured by non-payment. It was held by Goulding J that as a general rule a\n\ndeposit was demanded and paid on the signing of a contract for the sale of land, or grant\n\nof a lease at a premium, as an earnest of the purchaser’s ability to complete the\n\ncontract in due course; the vendor did not in the normal case, intend to be bound by the\n\ncontract without having the deposit in his own or his stakeholder’s possession as a\n\nprotection against possible loss from default by the purchaser. Since there was nothing in\n\nthe language of cl 2 of the agreement, or the special circumstances of the case, to\n\ndisplace the general rule, it followed that cl 2 stated a condition precedent to the\n\nagreement taking effect and, the deposit not having been paid, the plaintiff was not bound\n\nby the agreement. It was held in the alternative that if cl 2 did not express a condition\n\nprecedent, payment of the deposit under that clause was a fundamental term of the\n\ncontract, so that the defendant’s failure to comply with it entitled the plaintiff to\n\nrenounce further performance.106. The decisions inMyton Ltdand\n\nsucceeding cases were cited to the English Court of Appeal when it heardDamon Cia\n\nNaviera SA v Hapag-Lloyd International SA[1985] 1 All ER 475 a case involving a\n\ncontract for the sale of three vessels. One of the issues there was the effect of cl 2\n\nwhich provided ‘As a security for the correct fulfilment of this contract, the Buyers\n\nshall pay a deposit of 10% … of the Purchase Money on signing this contract\n\n…’. The court held that actual payment of the deposit was not necessarily a\n\ncondition precedent to the formation of the contract. The parties had entered into an\n\nexecutory sale agreement, all the terms of which had been finalised, and there was no\n\nreason to infer that a contract did not arise until the deposit was paid, since the\n\nprovision for such payment was a fundamental term of the contract itself.107. Fox LJ in the course of his judgment\n\nconsidered various authorities which had been cited on the question of the effect of a\n\nclause providing for payment of a deposit in a contract for sale. He said (at pp 483 to\n\n484):‘InMillichamp v Jones[1983]   1 All ER 267, [1982] 1 WLR 1422 there was a written agreement for the purchase of land. It\n\n  included a provision for payment of a deposit. The purchaser failed to pay the deposit.\n\n  Warner J held that the payment of the deposit was not a condition precedent to the\n\n  creation of a contract. Having referred to the authorities which I have mentioned he said\n\n  ([1983] 1 All ER 267 at 274, [1982] 1 WLR 1422 at 1430):\"… it seems to me that unless a\n\n    distinction is to be made between sales by auction and sales by private treaty, the weight\n\n    of authority is in favour of the view that a requirement in a contract for the sale of\n\n    land that a deposit should be paid by the purchaser does not constitute a condition\n\n    precedent, failure to fulfil which prevents the contract from coming into existence, but\n\n    is in general to be taken as a fundamental term of the contract, breach of which entitles\n\n    the vendor, if he so elects, to treat the contract as at an end and to sue for damages\n\n    including the amount of the unpaid deposit. Nor do I see that anything, either in the\n\n    authorities or in principle, calls for a distinction to be made in that respect between\n\n    sales by auction and sales by private treaty.\"InPortaria Shipping Co v Gulf Pacific\n\n  Navigation Co Ltd, The Selene G[1981] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 180 the written agreement\n\n  followed the Norwegian sale form but with some amendments. Clause 2 provided:\"As security for the correct\n\n    fulfilment of this contract the Buyers shall pay a deposit of 10%… of the Purchase\n\n    Money within 48 hours … after signing this Memorandum of Agreement …\"The buyers did not pay the deposit and the\n\n  sellers rescinded. It was held by Robert Goff J that the obligation to pay the deposit was\n\n  an essential term of the contract. It was not suggested that the payment of the deposit\n\n  was a condition precedent to the existence of the contract.Of the cases to which I have referred the\n\n  condition precedent question was only directly in issue inMyton Ltd v Schwab-Morris\n\n  and Millichamp v Jones. While I differ with hesitation from the view of Goulding J,\n\n  who has much experience in matters relating to the sale of land, I do not feel able to\n\n  agree that in general, where the agreement provides for the payment of a deposit, such\n\n  payment is necessarily a prerequisite to the formation of a contract. It may well be that\n\n  in practice a vendor’s solicitors would refuse to exchange contracts until the\n\n  deposit was in their hands or that of a stakeholder. But in my view, if the parties, as in\n\n  the present case, actually enter into an executory agreement for sale all the terms of\n\n  which are finalised, one of them being that a deposit shall be paid, and which objectively\n\n  is a contractual agreement, I see no reason for inferring that no contract arises until\n\n  the deposit is paid. The provision for the payment of a deposit is simply a term of the\n\n  contract. In the absence of special provision it does not seem to me to carry with it any\n\n  implication that it is a condition precedent to the existence of contractual relations.\n\n  And in none of the cases to which I have referred, exceptMyton Ltd v Schwab-Morris and\n\n  Millichamp v Jones(in which it failed), does such a suggestion appear to have been\n\n  advanced at all. It seems also to have been raised before Goulding J inBeck v Box(1973)\n\n  231 EG 1295 but he did not have to decide it.Accordingly, I prefer the view of Warner J\n\n  inMillichamp v Jonesand hold that the provision for payment of the deposit was\n\n  not a condition precedent to the formation of a contract. It was in my view a fundamental\n\n  term of the contract. I entirely agree with the view of Goulding J inMyton Ltd v\n\n  Schwab-Morris[1974] 1 All ER 326 at 331, [1974] 1 WLR 331 at 337 (expressed on the\n\n  alternative basis that he was wrong as to the condition precedent) that the provision for\n\n  payment of the deposit was ‘a term of so radical a nature that the defendant’s\n\n  failure to comply with it would entitle the plaintiff company to renounce further\n\n  performance’. (See alsoMillichamp v Jones and The Selene G.) The result, in\n\n  my opinion, is that the provision for payment of the deposit was not a condition precedent\n\n  to the formation of the contract but was a fundamental term of a concluded contract.’It should be noted that Goff LJ who was\n\nalso a member of the Court agreed with this view of the effect of a deposit clause\n\nalthough he was in the minority on the question of the damages due to the plaintiff in\n\nthat case. With due respect I agree with the views expressed inDamon Cia Naviera SAcase.108. In the present case, cl 2 of the\n\nAgreement provided:‘Upon the signing of this Agreement\n\n  the Purchaser shall pay to the Vendor a sum of Dollars Twenty-four thousand ($24,000) as\n\n  and by way of deposit herein (the receipt whereby the Vendor hereby acknowledges)’.There was nothing else in the Agreement\n\nwhich reflected on the status of the deposit clause which would distinguish it from the\n\nordinary deposit clause that, as Fox LJ pointed out, does not operate as a condition\n\nprecedent but is simply a term of the contract. In my judgment, the clause here was not a\n\ncondition precedent either. It was a fundamental term of the contract and if it had not\n\nbeen complied with, could have permitted the plaintiffs to repudiate the contract for\n\nbreach on the part of the defendants. The clause was, however, complied with in that the\n\nplaintiffs had already agreed to treat the option fee as the deposit.109. In any case, if one is going to\n\nrepudiate a contract because of fundamental breach on the part of the other party, one\n\nmust do so quickly or one loses that right. In this case, the plaintiffs did not repudiate\n\nthe contract expressly until 14 January 2000 when their solicitors wrote that the sale was\n\ndeemed to be aborted because the defendants had not signed and returned the Agreement\n\nwithin the agreed time and with the required deposit. By that time the defendants had\n\ntaken various steps in relation to the property in the belief that the contract was valid\n\nand existing and in my view it was too late for the plaintiffs to so elect. In their\n\nclosing submissions, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants had had early constructive\n\nnotice of repudiation of the Agreement in that Gary Lee was informed on 24 December that\n\nthe plaintiffs had that day granted an option to Mr Lim in respect of the property. This\n\nproposition would only be maintainable if Gary Lee was at the time the defendants’\n\nagent so that notice to him was notice to them.110. The plaintiffs did make an argument\n\nthat Gary Lee was acting as the defendants’ agent by virtue of the commission\n\nagreement that he had signed with Amethyst. I do not accept that argument. The document\n\nonly related to Amethyst’s agreement to pay ALP a commission for broking the deal. It\n\ndid not appoint ALP as Amethyst’s agent much less the defendants’ agent for any\n\nother purpose. It was clear from Gary Lee’s evidence that in relation to everything\n\nthat happened once Amethyst had made it apparent that it would not exercise the option, he\n\nwas acting solely as agent for the plaintiffs. When Sam Bhojraj informed Gary Lee of the\n\noption to Mr Lim, the information was imparted and received by the latter as the agent of\n\nthe plaintiffs and his position as such was appreciated by both parties.111. I am satisfied that on 23 December\n\n1999, there was a valid and enforceable contract for the sale of the property by the\n\nplaintiffs to the defendants. This contract was embodied in the Agreement, a document that\n\nis legally binding on both parties. Nothing that happened thereafter changed the legal\n\nposition. The defendants acquired an interest in the property by reason of the Agreement\n\nand were entitled to place their caveat against it in January 2000. It might have helped\n\nmatters had they put in a caveat immediately after signing the document but a caveat\n\nreflects an equitable interest, it does not create one. The defendants’ failure to\n\nlodge the caveat for some weeks could not change their equitable position as purchasers.",
        "Conclusion": "112. In the circumstances, the defendants\n\nhave shown cause why they should not be ordered to remove their caveat. The\n\nplaintiffs’ action must fail. I therefore dismiss it with costs.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
