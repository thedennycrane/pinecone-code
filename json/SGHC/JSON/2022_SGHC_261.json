        "Introduction": "1 The plaintiff, Mr Kallivalap Praveen Nair (“Praveen”), brings this action against his former employer, Glaxosmithkline Consumer Healthcare Pte Ltd (“GSK”), for breach of his employment agreement, on the grounds that GSK discriminated against him and caused him to lose the opportunity to secure roles in GSK and another company, Unilever.",
        "Factual background": "2 Praveen was previously employed by GSK Consumer Healthcare Limited (“GSK India”) as its Head of Expert Sales and Marketing for the Indian subcontinent.1Foot Note 1×Kallivalap Praveen Nair’s Affidavit of Evidence in Chief (“Praveen’s AEIC”) at [7].In 2018, Praveen joined GSK as an employee. GSK is a company incorporated in Singapore. It serves as the regional headquarters for consumer healthcare operations of the group (“GlaxoSmithKline”).2Foot Note 2×Praveen’s AEIC at [6]. 3 On or around 16 May 2018, Praveen signed a Letter of Appointment (“LOA”) with GSK, taking on the role of Global Expert Director for Nutrition and Digestive Health business (“NDH”). In June 2018, Praveen relocated to Singapore with his family.3Foot Note 3×Praveen’s AEIC at [8] and [10]. 4 In or around November or December 2018, GlaxoSmithKline announced the sale of its Nutrition business to Unilever (“Unilever Deal”). The Unilever Deal was completed around April 2020. In or around December 2018, GlaxoSmithKline announced its acquisition of Pfizer’s consumer business (“Pfizer Deal”). The Pfizer Deal was completed around August 2019.4Foot Note 4×Praveen’s AEIC at [46]-[49]. 5 Sometime in late May to June 2019, Praveen interacted with Unilever personnel to discuss opportunities at Unilever. He was ultimately not selected for any of the roles with Unilever.5Foot Note 5×Praveen’s AEIC at [78]. 6 On 11 June 2019, GSK announced through an email sent on behalf of Ms Tamara Rogers (“Tamara”), who was GlaxoSmithKline’s designate Chief Marketing Officer at the material time, that a new Global Head of Expert Marketing role had been created and that Ms Tess Player (“Tess”) had been appointed to that role. This was regarded as a “LT-1” role,ie, “Leadership Team minus one”, which meant it was one level below Leadership Team roles. Praveen was not invited to apply for that role.6Foot Note 6×Praveen’s AEIC at [91]. 7 From around June 2019 to September 2019, Praveen took part in GSK’s assessment and selection (“A&S”) process for new Global Expert Category “LT-2” roles (ie, Leadership Team minus two, which meant one level below LT-1 roles) that were created following GlaxoSmithKline’s restructuring. Between August and November 2019, GSK announced the appointments for the LT-2 roles that Praveen applied for. He was not selected for these roles.7Foot Note 7×Praveen’s AEIC at [112]-[120]. 8 On or around 2 December 2019, Mr Rick Sheppard (“Rick”), who was Praveen’s line manager, informed him that there were no roles available for him and that he would be made redundant.8Foot Note 8×Praveen’s AEIC at [136].A notice of redundancy was issued to Praveen in January 2020 which stated that his last day of employment would be 14 April 2020.9Foot Note 9×Praveen’s AEIC at [138]-[139].Praveen sought to extend his last day of employment to 30 September 2020. GSK subsequently extended Praveen’s last day of employment to 30 June 2020.10Foot Note 10×Praveen’s AEIC at [143]. 9 In this suit, Praveen claims against GSK for damages in the amount of $1,239,158.91 for breaches of his employment agreement with GSK (“EA”), which he claims resulted in the loss of his opportunity to land a role with Unilever, a new LT-1 role in GSK and LT-2 roles in GSK. Praveen also claims that GSK is liable to him for the shortfall in his severance payment of $148,809.83, and for the sum of $49,503.21 which he claimed was wrongfully withheld by GSK from his salary. 10 GSK counterclaims for the sum of $95,211.87, which it says was paid to Praveen by mistake.",
        "Whether the Employment Agreement expressly imposes an obligation on GSK to comply with the Policies": "11 Praveen claims that GSK breached its policies (“the Policies”), which are defined at cl 5.2 of the LOA. These include the following:11Foot Note 11×Plaintiff’s Closing Submission (“PCS”) at [9]. (a) Code of Conduct;(b) Policy on Equal and Inclusive Treatment of Employees (the “Equality Policy”);(c) Policy on Non-retaliation and Safeguarding Individuals who report Significant Misconduct (the “Non-Retaliation Policy”);(d) Redundancy policies;(e) General Bonus Plan Rules;(f) Global Long-Term Incentive Delivery documents, including:(i) the Long-Term Incentive Guide Incentive Guide on Share Value Plan entitlements for Grades 4 – 6;(ii) the Information on the Change in timing of the SVP awards 2012 – 2019; and(iii) the Share Value Plan Leaver Rules;(g) GSK Singapore Health & Wellbeing Handbook; and(h) GSK’s Employee Handbook. 12 The first issue which the plaintiff has to address, is whether the EA expressly imposes an obligation on GSK to comply with the Policies. 13 The plaintiff submits that cll 5.3 and 11.1 of the LOA expressly impose such an obligation on GSK.12Foot Note 12×PCS at [8].The relevant clauses are cll 5.2, 5.3 and 11.1 of the LOA. They state: Clause 5.2 –Youshall comply with all existing policies of the Company, its parent, subsidiary and associated companies (“GSK Group of Companies”)which are applicable to youin the course of your employment which may be varied, amended, introduced, modified or revoked from time to time (“Policies”).It is your responsibility to keep yourself updatedwith the latest version of such Policies as may [sic] made available on the Company’s intranet. Any such variation, amendment, introduction, modification or revocation is effective on the date stated on the Company’s intranet.” Clause 5.3 – In addition, if any of the terms set out in this Letter of Appointment conflicts with or is inconsistent with any Laws and Regulations and/or Policies prevailing from time to time, the latter shall prevail and the conflicting or inconsistent terms of this Letter of Appointment shall be deemed amended to be in line with the provisions of the then prevailing Laws and Regulations and/or Policies. Clause 11.1 – This Letter of Appointment and the documents expressly referenced herein contain the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof … In the event of any inconsistency between this Letter of Appointment and any of the documents expressed referenced therein, the provisions shall prevail in the following order: (a) any Laws and Regulations and/or Policies of the GSK Group of Companies, as varied, amended, introduced, modified or revoked from time to time; (b) the Letter of Appointment … [emphasis added in bold] 14 On a plain reading, cl 5.2 only obliges Praveen, the employee, to comply with the Polices. It does not oblige GSK, the employer, to comply with the Policies. In other words, under cl 5.2, the Policies are incorporated only to the extent that they impose obligations on Praveen as the employee. 15 Clause 5.3 is clearly intended to be read together with cl 5.2, as it begins with the phrase “In addition” and it refers to “Policies”, which was defined in cl 5.2. The phrase “Policies prevailing from time to time” that is mentioned in cl 5.3 must hence be in reference to “Policies” as mentioned in cl 5.2. Consequently, under cl 5.3, the Policies that prevail over conflicting or inconsistent LOA terms must refer to Policies that impose obligations on Praveen as the employee, and not Policies that impose obligations on GSK as the employer. 16 In a similar vein, the opening line of cl 11.1 refers to the LOA and the documents “expressly referenced herein”. The Policies are expressly referenced in cl 5.2, which as stated above, plainly oblige only the employee, Praveen, to comply with the Policies, and not the employer, GSK. Consequently, undercl 11.1, the Policies that prevail over conflicting or inconsistent LOA terms must refer to Policies that impose obligations on Praveen as the employee, and not Policies that impose obligations on GSK as the employer. 17 I hence find that the EA does not expressly impose an obligation on GSK to comply with the Policies.",
        "Whether there is an implied term of mutual trust and confidence": "18 The plaintiff alternatively submits that the EA contains an implied term of mutual trust and confidence (“ITMTC”), the content of which includes compliance by Praveen and GSK withallthe Policies, known or unknown13Foot Note 13×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 7, lines 3 to 8.. The plaintiff submits that the ITMTC is implied in law or on the facts.14Foot Note 14×PCS at [22] and [23].",
        "Implied on the facts": "19 I will first examine whether there is a basis for an ITMTC, as pleaded, to be implied on the facts here. 20 The test for implying a term in fact was set out inSembcorp Marine Ltd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd[2013] 4 SLR 193 (“Sembcorp”) and consists of three steps: (a) First, the court will ascertain how the gap in the contract arose. The implied term will be considered only if the court discerns that the gap arose because the parties did not contemplate the gap. (b) Second, the court will determine whether it is necessary in the business or commercial sense to imply a term in order to give efficacy to the contract. (c) Third, the court will consider whether the specific term to be implied was one which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had it been put to them at time of the contract. If it is not possible to find such a clear response, then, the gap persists, and the consequence of that gap ensues. 21 The plaintiff submits that the ITMTC as pleaded is necessary to give efficacy to the EA because GSK’s employees must be able to expect GSK’s compliance with its own policies, which addresses key aspects of the employment relationship. Praveen cites as an example of this, GSK’s policies providing for key components of employees’ remuneration.15Foot Note 15×PCS at [28].However, employment contracts generally contain specific provisions that deal with the remuneration of employees. This is also the case for Praveen. Clauses 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the LOA explicitly set out his remuneration and other entitlements. It could not be said that the ITMTC as pleaded is necessary to ensure proper remuneration. More generally, even if GSK employees expect GSK to comply with its own policies, that does not make it a business or commercial necessity such that it should be contractually part of the EA. Therefore, I do not find the second step of theSembcorptest,ie, business or commercial necessity, to be made out. 22 Neither is the third step of theSembcorptest met. As applied to this case, this requires that the ITMTC as pleaded is one to which the parties, having regard to the need for business efficacy, would have responded “Oh, of course!” had it been put to them at time of the contract. 23 Having expressly limited the obligation of complying with Policies to be on the employee and not the entity, it is not apparent that GSK as an entity would have said of “Oh, of course!” if it was put to it that the ITMTC as pleaded was part of the contract. 24 The plaintiff submits that this test is satisfied as every witness confirmed that GSK’s employees had the right to expect GSK to comply with its policies.16Foot Note 16×Plaintiff’s Skeletal Submissions dated 22 September\" 2022 (“PSS”) at [20].However, Tamara, Tess and Mr Jayant Kumar Singh (who was one of Praveen’s line managers) (“Jayant”) all testified, when asked, that they did not know what an ITMTC was. In addition, they, along with Rick Sheppard (“Rick”) (Praveen’s line manager after Jayant), did not testify that they saw GSK’s compliance with the Policies as part of GSK’s contractual obligations to its employees. Their evidence is summarised as follows: (a) Rick saw a nuanced distinction between trust in a company and a legal obligation. He believed that the company’s legal obligations are set out in the employment contract, but that the company will also follow its values and expectations to look at the employment contract in the right light.17Foot Note 17×29 July 2022 Transcript at p 105 line 20 to p 106 line 3.The plaintiff submits that Rick testified that if GSK did not comply with its policies, the aggrieved employee would have a right to bring his claim to court.18Foot Note 18×PCS at [13].However, this is a misinterpretation of Rick’s testimony. The relevant portion of the transcript that the Plaintiff relies on is set out below:19Foot Note 19×29 July 2022 Transcript at p 117 line 24 to p 118 line 17. Q: Assuming that an employee operates in a country where there is no right to equal treatment and no right to be free from discrimination, the laws of the country do not provide for that, but those are in your policies … A: One more time? Q: No right to equal treatment, no positive right to equal treatment and no right to be free from discrimination, right, the employment contract doesn’t provide for that, the laws of the country doesn’t provide for that, but your code of conduct does; correct? A: Yes. Q: Do you agree that that employee should have a right to redress and compensation, whether from the courts or employment tribunals, if he suffered from unequal treatment or discrimination? A: In those particular circumstances? I think so, honestly. As evident from the above, all that Rick testified to was that in the particular circumstances described by the plaintiff, he thought that an employee should have a right of redress. Rick was not asked the more specific and relevant question – did Rick consider GSK to be contractually bound to follow its Policies? There is hence no evidence from Rick to that. (b) Tamara said that GSK employees had to follow the Code of Conduct, but the rules in the Code of Conduct were not law. The Code of Conduct applied to everyone in GSK and if an employee failed to comply, there may be disciplinary action. She considered an employee contractually bound by the Policies. She did not know if GSK as an entity would be contractually bound to its employees to follow the Policies.20Foot Note 20×4 August 2022 Transcript at p 24 lines 1 to 5. (c) Jayant said he did not have a clear view on whether his employment agreement contractually bound GSK to follow the Policies.21Foot Note 21×4 August 2022 Transcript at p 91 lines 8 to 15. (d) The plaintiff submitted that Tess testified that she would expect GSK to be contractually bound by the Policies.22Foot Note 22×PCS at [32(d)].Again, this is not supported by the transcript. What Tess said was that she did not know if the Policies were legally binding on GSK.23Foot Note 23×4 August 2022 Transcript at p 163 lines 17 to 23. 25 While these employees were senior employees within GSK, their seniority alone does not mean that they represent the will of the company. Their understanding of the terms of the Employment Contract is not necessarily representative of GSK’s understanding. Furthermore, even taking Praveen’s case at its highest, these witnesses did not know in the first place what an ITMTC was, and they also did not clearly consider GSK to be contractually bound by its Policies. Therefore, I find it difficult to conclude that they would have said “Oh of course!” if it was suggested to them that GSK was contractually bound by the ITMTC as pleaded. Neither is there any evidence before the court to conclude that GSK as an entity would have also said “Oh of course” to this suggestion. That GSK expressly limited the obligation of compliance with the Policies to employees in cl 5.2 of the EA, suggests the contrary. 26 I hence find that neither step 2 nor step 3 of theSembcorptest is satisfied on the evidence, and that the plaintiff has not proven that the ITMTC is implied in fact.",
        "Implied in law": "27 I will next examine if an ITMTC as pleaded should be implied in law. GSK makes a preliminary argument that the ITMTC cannot be part of the EA because it contradicts the express terms of the EA.24Foot Note 24×Defendant’s Closing Submissions (“DCS”) at [19].However, while cl 5.2 of the LOA places an obligation on the employee to comply with the Policies, and there is no term placing an obligation on the employer GSK to comply with the Policies, there is no express term in the LOA precluding the inclusion of the ITMTC as pleaded. 28 The plaintiff relies on decisions such asCheah Peng Hock v Luzhou Bio-Chem Technology Ltd[2013] 2 SLR 577 (“Cheah Peng Hock”) to support its position. There, the High Court held that unless there are express terms to the contrary or the context implied otherwise, an implied term of mutual trust and confidence and fidelity, is implied by law into a contract of employment under Singapore law: at [59]. Subsequent High Court decisions have also recognized the existence of the ITMTC in Singapore law. 29 GSK relies on the observations of the Appellate Division of the High Court inDong Wei v Shell Eastern Trading (Pte) Ltd and another[2022] 1 SLR 1318 (\"Dong Wei\") to submit that the issue of whether ITMTC is part of Singapore law is still an open question. InDong Wei, the Appellate Division noted at [73] that the Court of Appeal inWee Kim San Lawrence Bernard vRobinson & Co (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2014] 4 SLR 357 (\"Wee Kim San\") did not formally endorse the existence of the ITMTC, unlike certain High Court decisions. The Court of Appeal inWee Kim Sanwas cognisant thatCommonwealth Bank of Australia v Barker(2013) 214 FCR 450 (“Barker(FC)”) – then in the Federal Court of Australia (“FCA”) – was on appeal to the High Court of Australia (“HCA”): at [30]. In a subsequent Court of Appeal decision inThe One Suites Pte Ltd v Pacific Motor Credit (Pte) Ltd[2015] 3 SLR 695 (“One Suites”), the Court of Appeal expressly noted thatWee Kim Sanleft open the position in Singapore on the existence of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence: at [44]. The court inDong Weithus observed at [82]: … the status of the implied term of mutual trust and confidence has not been clearly settled in Singapore. It remains an open question for the Court of Appeal to resolve in a more appropriate case, ideally with facts capable of bearing out a claim based directly on the existence of the implied term. 30 GSK also refers to the decision of the HCA inCommonwealth Bank of Australia vBarker(2014) 312 ALR 356 (“Barker (HC)”) to support its position that the ITMTC should not be recognized under Singapore law. The issue of whether the ITMTC should be implied by law in Australia, was considered extensively by the HCA inBarker(HC).The factual matrixinBarker(HC)is similar to the present case in three aspects: (a) Praveen similarly argues that GSK must be bound by its own Policies;  (b) Praveen’s pleaded case is that his claim is not based on the act of dismissal but on the ground that he has been unfairly treated in the selection process for Unilever, LT-1 and LT-2 roles; and (c) Praveen is also claiming damages for the loss of chance of obtaining those roles. 31 I begin my analysis of the parties’ submissions on whether the ITMTC as pleaded should be implied in law, by observing that the content of the ITMTC that the plaintiff seeks to ascribe to the ITMTC, namely that GSK as the employer is contractually bound to comply with the Policies, is not something that has been held to be part of the ITMTC. When asked, counsel for the plaintiff confirmed to the court that he has not found any precedent anywhere, where an ITMTC of the pleaded content, that a company has to comply with its policies, has been accepted.25Foot Note 25×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 5, lines 14 to 22. 32 The court inCheah Peng Hockat [56] set out examples of the application of an ITMTC. These include: (a) a duty not to act in a corrupt manner which would clearly undermine the employee’s future job prospects (Malik v BCCI[1998] AC 20) (“Malik”); (b) a duty not to unilaterally and unreasonably vary terms (Woods v W M Car Services (Peterborough) Ltd[1982] ICR 693);(c) a duty to redress complaints of discrimination or provide a grievance procedure (W A Goold (Pearmak) Ltd v McConnell[1995] IRLR 516);(d) a duty not to suspend an employee for disciplinary purposes without proper and reasonable cause (Gogay v Hertfordshire CC[2000] IRLR 703);(e) a duty to enquire into complaints of sexual harassment (Bracebridge Engineering Ltd v Darby[1990] IRLR 3);(f) a duty to behave with civility and respect (Isle of Wight Tourist Board v Coombes[1976] IRLR 413);(g) a duty not to reprimand without merit in a humiliating circumstance (Hilton International Hotels (UK) v Protopapa[1990] IRLR 316); and(h) a duty not to behave in an intolerable or wholly unacceptable way (British Aircraft Corporation Ltd v Austin[1978] IRLR 332). 33 It was argued before the HCA inBarker(HC)that the range of duties imposed by the ITMTC introduces inherent uncertainties. The HCA inBarker(HC)affirmed Jessup J’s dissent inBarker(FC)that the ITMTC will have “the potential to act as a Trojan horse in the sense of revealing only after the event the specific prohibitions which it imports into the contract”: at [117]. I note that the court inCheah Peng Hockwas also cognizant of the wide range of duties imposed under the ITMTC at [56], but nevertheless found that the ITMTC exists under Singapore law. 34 However, in my view, the tension betweenBarker(HC)’s concerns as to the uncertainties associated with the ITMTC as a doctrine andCheah Peng Hock’s recognition of the ITMC, is not the nub of the issue in this case. 35 This is because the issue before this court is not whether the ITMTC, in the form that has been applied in previous cases, is part of Singapore law, in the light of the analysis inBarker(HC). The ITMTC as pleaded is very different from the formulation of the ITMTC inMalikthat “[p]arties shall not engage in conduct likely to undermine the trust and confidence required if the employment relationship is to continue in the manner the employment contract implicitly envisages”. Rather, the issue is this: even assuming that the ITMTC is part of Singapore law, should the content of the ITMTC include a contractual duty on the part of the employer to comply with its internal policies? Counsel for the plaintiff accepts that this would indeed be the inquiry before this court, and that even if this court accepts that ITMTC is part of Singapore law, the court will have to find that an ITMTC of the pleaded content is part of Singapore law.26Foot Note 26×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 6, lines 3 to 17. 36 To sharpen the inquiry before this court, the substance of what the plaintiff is contending is no different in terms of the outcome, if his submission was that there should be “an implied term in the EA that GSK should comply with its policies”, rather than “an implied term ofmutual trust and confidencein the EA that GSK should comply with its policies”. 37 Even assuming, without making a judgment on it, that the ITMTC is part of Singapore law, the plaintiff’s submission here on the pleaded ITMTC introduces a different order of uncertainty. It is trite law that the certainty of contractual terms is an important tenet of contract law. InT2 Networks Pte Ltd v Nasioncom SdnBhd[2008] 2 SLR(R) 1 at [44], Judith Prakash J, as she then was, citedG Scammell and Nephew, Limited v H C and J G Ouston[1941] AC 251 (at 268-269) for the proposition: It is a necessary requirement that an agreement in order to be binding must be sufficiently definite to enable the court to give it a practical meaning. Its terms must be so definite, or capable of being made definite without further agreement of the parties, that the promises and performances to be rendered by each party are reasonably certain. 38 The doctrine of implication of terms in law inevitably raises some degree of uncertainty given the broadness of the criteria utilized to imply such terms:Jet Holding Ltd and others v Cooper Cameron (Singapore) Pte Ltd and another and other appeals[2006] 4 SLR(R) 769 at [90]. Therefore, courts must be cautious in determining whether to imply certain terms in law and carefully consider the degree of uncertainty that such terms may introduce. Further caution should be exercised when the content of the implied term involves a concept which is itself controversial:Ng Giap Hon v Westcomb Securities Pte Ltd[2009] 3 SLR(R) 518 at [46]. 39 The uncertainty here takes place at two levels, first in respect of GSK, and second, in respect of other companies. 40 First, in respect of GSK, not all the content or clauses in GSK’s company policies were traversed in the course of the trial. Only the Policies and particular clauses of the Policies that were relied on for the plaintiff’s action were mentioned. There remains a large body of GSK’s documents that are neither identified nor discussed (‘the unknown GSK documents”), the legal status of which remains unclear by the end of the trial. 41 Hence, it could not be said with certainty which of the unknown GSK documents should rightly be regarded as part of GSK’s policies or contractual obligations. This is particularly since, even for purposes of this suit, there are documents which are titled as “Guidance” or “Best Practices”, but which the plaintiff submits are nevertheless contractually binding policies, despite their wording on the face of the documents. 42 The plaintiff submits that GSK should still be bound by the unknown GSK documents since it knows what these other documents are. The plaintiff argues that since it has been pleaded that under cl 5.2 of the LOA, all GSK policies are part of the EA, then the onus is on GSK to identify which of the remaining unknown policies are not to be regarded as contractual obligations.27Foot Note 27×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 11, lines 2 to 6; p 12, lines 3 to 18. 43 With respect, I have several difficulties with this submission for the following reasons: (a) First, as set out above, cl 5.2 only binds the employee and not GSK. There is no express clause that incorporates a contractual obligation on GSK to follow all its policies. Indeed, it is because there is no express contractual obligation, that there is a need to consider whether there is an ITMTC. There is hence no place to rely on cl 5.2 of the LOA, in relation to this issue of uncertainty in the pleaded ITMTC. The uncertainty over the universe of unknown policies that should be subject to the pleaded ITMTC remains to be addressed. (b) Second, while the plaintiff submits that there is no uncertainty because GSK would know which policies are binding, the position taken by GSK in this case is that it disputes that there are any policy documents that are contractually binding on it in the first place. Therefore, it is no answer for the plaintiff to say that GSK would be able to identify these unknown GSK documents. Most certainly, an employee would also not know what is the realm of unknown GSK documents that are regarded as contractually binding. (c) Third, there could be many other unknown GSK documents for which it is uncertain if such documents are policy documents and if they bind GSK. This is especially when the plaintiff’s position during the trial was that townhall communications can also be classified as policies. It would be overly onerous to expect GSK to identify all such potential documents in the course of this suit and clarify which of such documents are policies, and which of these policies are regarded as binding. This is especially when many of these documents may not be or are unlikely to be related to this suit, since they were not relied on by the plaintiff. 44 Therefore, the first order of uncertainty for GSK, if the pleaded ITMTC is upheld, is the uncertainty over which of the unknown GSK documents are to be regarded as policies. 45 There is a second order of uncertainty with the pleaded ITMTC in relation to GSK. Even if it can be ascertained which of the unknown GSK documents are to be regarded as policies, it is uncertain which part of such policies should be regarded as contractually binding under the pleaded ITMTC. Many of the statements in the Policies, such as in the Code of Conduct, are clearly phrased as aspirational statements. They do not appear to give employees a contractual right to sue. The defendant referred to “principles of equality, transparency and integrity” as an example. Another example is the company’s value of “Respect” stated in the Code of Conduct, which is described as “supporting colleagues and communities around us, and embracing diversity and individuality, so that we can all achieve great things”. It is not apparent that this was intended to give employees the contractual right to sue GSK for any lack of diversity or impose legal standards that GSK is contractually obliged to meet. A similar point was made inTan Swee Wan and another v Johnny LianTian Yong[2018] SGHC 169. There, it was alleged at [50(c)] that a term stating that “the ultimate objective … was to list [a company] on NASDAQ, a stock exchange in the United States of America” was a contractually binding term. The court rejected this, holding at [240] that the term was merely “an aspiration”, as it was “hard to see how the defendant could agree to be subject to such a term … [the success of the NASDAQ] listing would depend on numerous variables and circumstances, some or many of which the parties will have little control over”. 46 The plaintiff acknowledges that there are aspirational statements in the Policies and submits that aspirational statements should be treated as obligations for GSK to use reasonable endeavours to achieve those standards. Where, however, there are statements in the Policies that are phrased in mandatory language, those should be treated as binding even though there is an aspirational quality.28Foot Note 28×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 15 line 12 to p 16 line 10.The plaintiff cites as an example, a line from the Equality Policy29Foot Note 29×Praveen’s AEIC at p 189.which states that “managers and anyone with managerial responsibilities must … [d]emonstrate equal and inclusive treatment of employees” and submits that since the phrase “must” was used, it should be regarded as a contractual obligation.30Foot Note 30×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 17, lines 1 to 13.However, the very same page of that document also states that managers must “[c]reate an environment where employees are engaged in challenging work that matches their talents and increases their skills”. Whether there is such an environment would be highly subjective. What constitutes a breach would be highly uncertain. It is not likely that GSK would regard such a phrase as contractually binding, even though the word “must” was used. Words such as “must” or ‘should” can also be used as exhortations, particularly in aspirational documents, and need not necessarily indicate an intention to impose a contractual obligation. 47 There is a separate level of uncertainty with the pleaded ITMTC, and that is in relation to other companies or entities, whether in the private sector, public sector or charity sector. There is no evidence before the court of the content that other companies put into their internal policies, and whether it would be appropriate for such policies to be treated as part of those companies’ contractual obligations with their employees, which is the inevitable outcome if the plaintiff is correct in submitting that the ITMTC as pleaded is implied by law. 48 The plaintiff seeks to go around this difficulty by submitting that the ITMTC as pleaded need not go that far as to affect other companies. This is because it was held inCheah Peng Hockat [60] that the content of ITMTC can vary greatly depending on the facts of each case. The plaintiff hence submits that a finding that the pleaded ITMTC is implied by law need not affect other companies.31Foot Note 31×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 20 line 5 to p 21 line 16. 49 However, the plaintiff also accepts thatForefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v Modern-Pak Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 (“Forefront”) was correct in holding at [42] that “once a term has been implied [in law], such a term will be implied in all future contracts ofthat particular type… [T]he central idea is clear: it is that the term implied is implied in ageneralway for all specific contracts that come within the purview of a broader umbrella category of contracts” [emphasis in original].32Foot Note 32×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 21, line 17 to p 22, line 2.The EA does not appear to be particularly unique. Following the principle set out inForefront, at the least, a company that imposes a contractual obligation on its employees to comply with company policies, would similarly face an implied term that the company too would be contractually bound by such policies. Moreover, counsel for the plaintiff also accepts that if the pleaded ITMTC is upheld on the basis of it being implied by law, then such a decision would have precedential value, and other companies would have to be more precise if they do not want to be bound by their internal policies in future. In other words, there would be impact on other companies.33Foot Note 33×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 25, lines 9 to 25. 50 This raises the question of whether it is appropriate, by way of implying in law the pleaded ITMTC, to lay down a contractual obligation for other companies to comply with their policies. Many companies include in their internal documents, aspirational statements, as GSK did in this case. It is commendable that companies put in aspirational statements in their policies, as it provides high standards to strive towards. Oftentimes, companies do so knowing that they may not be at that standard yet, but the aspirational statements are nevertheless useful in providing the right directions to strive toward. It is unlikely that they conceived of such aspirational statements as being contractual obligations when they were crafted. It is also unclear whether organisations would be discouraged from having such aspirational statements and goals included in their policies if they were regarded as contractual obligations. The plaintiff acknowledges that aspirational statements could be caught by the umbrella of “all policies” and submits that the distinction should be based on whether the aspirational statements were phrased in mandatory terms. However, the plaintiff also accepts that it is not known if aspirational statements elsewhere have been written in mandatory terms or not.34Foot Note 34×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 27, line 23 to p 28, line 21.Consequently, there is uncertainty over whether the aspirational statements in internal policies for other companies should be held to be contractually binding, simply because of the presence of some mandatory language, particularly when these could be set out in aspirational documents such as documents on the values of a company. All of these introduce uncertainty of an order which was not placed before the court inCheah Peng Hock. 51 This brings me to another issue, which is whether a court hearing involving a private dispute between a company and its employee, is the best modality to decide if the internal policies of other companies, should be part of their contractual obligations with their employees. InBarker(HC), the HCA observed that the ITMTC would “intrude a common law policy choice of broad and uncertain scope into an area of frequent, detailed and often contentious legislative activity”: at [118]. Our courts have also expressed similar concerns about such intrusion and have held that it “is impermissible for the courts to arrogate to themselves legislative powers” or become “mini-legislatures”:Lim Meng Suangand another v Attorney-General and another appeal and another matter[2015] 1 SLR 26 (“Lim Meng Suang”) at [77]. This is because the courts have no mandate to create or amend laws in a manner which permits recourse to extra-legal policy factors as well as considerations. The jurisdiction as well as the power to do so lie exclusively within the sphere of the legislature:Lim Meng Suangat [77]. At the same time, our courts have been able to make advancements in areas of common law, which affect a polarity of parties, for example with respect to the test on medical negligence inHii Chii Kok v Ooi Peng Jin London Lucien and another[2017] 2 SLR 492. 52 In my view, the issue here is not about the respective capabilities or the proper reach of the different institutions. Rather, it is a question of whether the wider impact on other companies that flows from the plaintiff’s submission on the pleaded ITMTC, is one that is best arrived at through the process of a private employment dispute between two parties,ie, the plaintiff and GSK. 53 The plaintiff’s submission is a very broad and far reaching one. 54 If accepted, his submission will lead to implications for other companies in the private sector, public sector and charity sector, and not just GSK. There will be a precedent for companies to becontractually boundby their own policies pursuant to an ITMTC. Yet, there is nothing before the court as to what constitutes policies for these companies or what part of their policies should be binding. For example, the plaintiff submits that GSK’s townhall communications of 29 May 2019 and June 2019 constitute policies. However, townhalls are generally used for internal communications and discussions between an organisation and its staff. There would be a wide range of communications in a townhall. It is not clear that all such communications would or should be regarded as policies. Neither is there evidence on whether other companies have drafted their policies with the intent that the clauses of such documents could form a potential ground for a contractual claim against the company. A ruling that such policies have contractual force could have widespread implications on the employer-employee dynamic in Singapore, raising many unanswered questions and uncertainties. For example, what are the implications if companies subsequently re-frame their policies in order to limit such unintended legal exposure? What are the legal effects of internal policies that are not published to employees? Whose breach would suffice to constitute a breach on the part of the company in relation to this broad range of policies? Will another employee’s breach of the company’s policies be attributed to the company? These are highly pertinent questions that affect the landscape of employment relationship in Singapore. 55 For the above reasons, I find that even on the assumption that the ITMTC exists in Singapore, the ITMTC as pleaded by the plaintiff,ie, that a company is contractually bound to comply with all its policies, is not part of Singapore law. 56 In summary, I observe that while the plaintiff frames his case as being based on the ITMTC, there is no precedent for an ITMTC of the content that he seeks to ascribe. While positioning the claim as one of an ITMTC may allow the plaintiff to tap into the jurisprudence accepting ITMTC, one should not lose sight that the fundamental question that the plaintiff’s submission raises is not whether an ITMTC exists in Singapore law, but whether it should be implied in law (through an ITMTC) that companies are contractually bound to comply with all their policies. For the reasons above, I find that such a term would be too uncertain. I also do not regard an employment dispute between two private parties as being the appropriate forum for determining that companies elsewhere are similarly contractually bound to comply with all their policies. 57 As this is a threshold question for the plaintiff, my finding that there is no ITMTC as pleaded that is implied in law, means that the plaintiff’s case would be dismissed on this basis alone. 58 For completeness, I nevertheless proceed to consider if there are breaches of the EA, assuming that an ITMTC as pleaded, is implied by law in Singapore. As set out in my assessment below, I find that the facts do not bear out a claim based directly on the ITMTC as pleaded, even if it existed.",
        "Praveen’s omission from the May 2019 GSK list of personnel eligible for assessment for Unilever roles": "",
        "Parties’ position": "148 The plaintiff submits that the way GSK computed his severance payment results in a shortfall of $148,809.83. This is in breach of the EA, particularly the Code of Conduct and GSK’s HR practices on severance payments, which Ms Ruth Tan (“Ruth”), the former Regional Human Resources Manager of GSK, communicated to Praveen. 149 The plaintiff claims that GSK, through Ruth, confirmed that it would pay Praveen severance payment of one month’s salary per year of service according to the Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment (“Retrenchment Advisory”). MOM confirmed that “salary” under the Retrenchment Advisory is defined under s 2 of the Employment Act, which includes various other components of Praveen’s remuneration (including allowances) over and above the basic pay. GSK’s computation of the severance payment due to Praveen, which is based only on the Praveen’s base salary, is therefore a breach of the EA. 150 GSK submits that there is no breach of the EA. In the first place, Praveen is not contractually entitled to any severance or redundancy payments. The EA does not contain any provisions which require GSK to make any severance payments to Praveen.127Foot Note 127×Rick’s AEIC at [96] to [97]. 151 The computation of Praveen's severance payments was based on Praveen's basic monthly salary (which was GSK's practice in Singapore), subject to conditions to be fulfilled. In this regard, the February Redundancy Notice issued to Praveen set out the severance package which he would receive as part of the redundancy process.128Foot Note 128×Ruth's AEIC at [39] to [40].It was provided that upon Praveen's signing and return of a “No Claims Acknowledgement and Undertaking” form which was enclosed with the February Redundancy Notice and Praveen's compliance with the terms in the February Redundancy Notice (read together with the January Redundancy Notice), he would be entitled to: (a) a severance payment of $144,716; and (b) pro-rated performance bonus of $35,781.70. The computation of the severance payment of $144,716 set out in the February Redundancy Notice was based on GSK's HR internal guidelines for Singapore, in particular, GSK’s redundancy policy for Singapore. This provided that severance payments to employees shall be based on the employee’s monthly basic salary (in particular, one month’s basic salary for each completed year of service). The formula would have been the product of the tenure of the employee's employment at GSK in years, and the monthly basic salary of the relevant employee. In Praveen's case, the severance payment of $144,716 was derived based on the number of years from 13 June 2014 to 30 June 2020 (6.05 years), multiplied by Praveen’s monthly salary of $23,920, which amounts to $144,716.40. 152 GSK submits that Praveen's claim that he was entitled to a larger sum of severance payment based on Retrenchment Advisory is without merit. 153 First, there is no basis for Praveen to rely on Ruth's WA message for his allegation that GSK \"abides\" by the Retrenchment Advisory. Ruth's message does not create a contractual agreement or entitlement. 154 Second, the Retrenchment Advisory does not impose statutory obligations on employers in any manner. It expressly states that it is only meant to \"assist and guide\" employers: “The Tripartite Advisory on Managing Excess Manpower and Responsible Retrenchment aims to assist and guide employers in managing their excess manpower, preserving jobs and conducting retrenchment exercises responsibly”. InHan Hui Hui and others v Attorney-General[2022] SGHC 141, the court held that an advisory issued by the Tripartite Alliance regarding COVID-19 vaccination at workplaces did not (a) have the force of law; (b) amount to a policy directive; or (c) carry any legal effect: [56]–[60]. In a similar vein, the Retrenchment Advisory does not amount to a policy directive or have legal effect. At its highest, the Retrenchment Advisory only provides guidance to employers regarding how they may (if they wished to) pay retrenchment benefits to their employees. Nothing in it directs or compels employers to pay retrenchment benefits to employees. 155 Third, and in any event, GSK's computation of severance payment is aligned with the Retrenchment Advisory's benchmark for “2 weeks to one month salary per year of service, depending on the financial position of the company and taking into consideration the industry norm.” As explained in Ruth's WA message to Praveen dated 7 December 2019, GSK provides for the “top end” of the guidelines set out in the Retrenchment Advisory.129Foot Note 129×Ruth's AEIC at [41].Given that, GSK computes severance payment on the basis of one month's base salary per year of service.",
        "My decision": "165 GSK’s basis for its counterclaim is that it was mistaken as to the fact that the plaintiff did not sign the No Claims Form. To succeed in this, GSK must show that (a) Praveen had been enriched; (b) the enrichment was at the expense of GSK; (c) the enrichment was unjust; and (d) there are no relevant defences to the claim:Singapore Swimming Club v Koh Sin Chong Freddie[2016] 3 SLR 845 (“Singapore SwimmingClub”) at [90]. 166 GSK relies here on mistake of fact, which is a well-established unjust enrichment factor. InSingapore Swimming Club,the Court of Appeal set out at [94] the following principles: (a) First, the claimant must prove that it had made a mistake, in that it believed that it was more likely than not that the true facts were otherwise than they in fact were. (b) Second, the claimant must show that its belief caused it to confer the benefit (ie, the severance payment) to the defendant – there must be a causative mistake. (c) Third, a claimant may still be denied relief if it had responded unreasonably to its doubt or unreasonably ran the risk of error. (d) Fourth, a claimant who had doubts may be denied relief on the distinct grounds that he has compromised or settled with the defendant, or on the basis that he is estopped from pleading the mistake. 167 On the evidence, GSK was aware that Praveen had reservations about the No Claim Forms. Praveen informed Ruth about this.134Foot Note 134×Ruth’s AEIC at [47].Ruth testified that she does not know if Praveen ultimately signed the No Claim Form as she moved to a new role within GSK on 15 April 2020. The email exchange between Ruth and Praveen was copied to Ms Lim Ai Hwa on 2 April 2020.135Foot Note 135×Ruth’s AEIC at p 122.She was Ruth’s manager and remained in GSK until June 2020. 168 Despite having notice about Praveen’s reservations about signing the No Claims Form, GSK proceeded to make two payments. First, the payment to IRAS for withholding tax in respect of Praveen’s severance payment. Second, to credit part of the severance payment to Praveen. There is no evidence that GSK was mistaken that Praveen had signed the No Claim Forms when it made the severance payment. In the absence of such evidence, it could also have been that GSK chose then to make such payment, and only decided to dispute the severance payment when Praveen brought his suit against GSK. I find that GSK has not proven that on the balance of probabilities, it made the payment under a mistake. 169 Furthermore, even if GSK was mistaken that Praveen had signed the No Claim Forms, I am of the view that it unreasonably ran the risk of error by proceeding with payment of the severance sum without ascertaining if the No Claims Form had in fact been signed. I therefore dismiss GSK’s counterclaim against Praveen.",

        "Plaintiff’s unpleaded claim that GSK breached its Non-Retaliation Policy and internal investigation policy": "139 In the plaintiff’s Closing Submissions, the plaintiff submits that GSK breached its Non-Retaliation Policy and internal investigation policy. However, while the events relating to the “Speak-Up” inquiry were pleaded at paragraphs 64 to 70 of the SOC, the plaintiff did not advance any claim in relation to this. This is clear from his claims as set out in the SOC at paragraphs 81 to 85, which do not reference paragraphs 64 to 70 of the SOC when advancing his claims. 140 GSK submits that if the plaintiff had properly pleaded his claim regarding the “Speak-Up” inquiry, they may have called Chris, the internal investigator to give evidence. It would hence be prejudicial to GSK for this unpleaded claim to proceed. I agree with GSK. The plaintiff subsequently clarified during oral submissions that the “Speak-Up” Inquiry did not constitute a separate head of claim, and that it was raised only in support of the alleged breaches in relation to LT-2 roles.119Foot Note 119×26 September 2022 Transcript at p 45, lines 6 to 13.",

        "Whether there is a breach of the Employment Agreement in GSK’s computation of Praveen’s severance payment": "",
        "Whether GSK is liable to Praveen for $49,503.21": "161 The plaintiff claims the sum of $49,503.21, which GSK withheld to satisfy any tax payable to IRAS on Praveen’s behalf. Praveen’s June 2020 pay slip shows that GSK withheld $180,497.70. It is undisputed that GSK paid Praveen’s income taxes for YA2020 ($49,494.57) and YA2021 ($81,499) in the total sum of $130,993.57. 162 This leaves the sum of $49,503.21 that is still withheld by GSK. There is no evidence that there were further taxes that GSK paid on behalf of Praveen. However, GSK submits that Praveen is still not entitled to this sum, as he is not entitled to any severance payments in the first place. This is because Praveen did not sign the No Claims Form, when it is a specific requirement of the Redundancy Notices that the GSK severance payment would be paid out only on Praveen’s signing of the No Claims Form.131Foot Note 131×Agreed Bundle of Documents, Vol 2 at pp 639 and 728.The plaintiff did not respond to this in its opening statement or written submissions. As there is an explicit requirement in the Redundancy Notices that Praveen is entitled to payment of severance payment only if he signs the No Claims Form, and this has not been met, I find that the plaintiff is not entitled to the $49,503.21, which the defendant had withheld.",
        "Whether Praveen is liable to GSK for GSK’s counterclaim for $95,211.87": "",
        "Parties’ Position": "163 The defendant counterclaims against the plaintiff for the sum of $95,211.87. GSK’s case is that sums were credited to Praveen in excess of what he is legally entitled to. As Praveen did not sign the No Claims Form, he is not entitled to any severance payments. The severance sum reflected in Praveen’s June 2020 pay-slip and the payment of $130,993.57 to the IRAS on Praveen’s behalf was a result of a mistake.132Foot Note 132×Rick's AEIC at [118].Based on GSK’s calculations, the sum of $95,211.87 had been overpaid to Praveen.133Foot Note 133×DCC at [60]-[67]. 164 Praveen submits that he is not liable to GSK for the counterclaim amount. Even if GSK was mistaken in crediting the severance payment to Praveen, he has since changed his position and would be prejudiced if GSK’s claim for unjust enrichment is allowed. Alternatively, GSK is estopped from now contending that Praveen’s signing of the No Claims Form was a prerequisite for the severance payment.",
        "Conclusion": "170 In conclusion, I dismiss the plaintiff’s claims against the defendant for breach of the EA leading to Praveen not being able to secure roles in Unilever, or the LT-1 and LT-2 roles in GSK. I also dismiss the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant for the sum of $49,503.21 withheld by the Defendant.
