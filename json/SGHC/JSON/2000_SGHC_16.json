        "THE CLAIM": "4 The Amended Statement of Claim pleaded as follows:\"AMENDED\n\n    STATEMENT OF CLAIM1. By a written agreement in the Chinese language dated 19thDecember 1997, the Plaintiff and the Defendants entered into the contract, the terms of\n\n        which are set out below. The contract was entered into in Singapore.2. Ms Shih Shia Wah (hereinafter referred to as \"Ms Shih\") as\n\n        the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Defendants, entered into the contract on\n\n        behalf of the Defendants. The Defendants through Ms Shih acting as their agent, servant or\n\n        employee, signed the agreement with the Plaintiff.3. The Defendants had at the material time, invested in a joint venture\n\n        project in China known as the Shenyang Wu Ai Cloths City (hereinafter referred to as\n\n        \"the investment\"). There was a dispute involving the investment. Under the\n\n        contract between the Defendants and the Plaintiff, the Plaintiff was engaged to resolve\n\n        the dispute and to recover the investments for the Defendants.4. It was, inter alia, agreed between the parties that the Defendants\n\n        would pay the Plaintiff a total sum of US$1,000,000.00 for his services under the\n\n        contract.5. It was, inter alia, a term of the contract that the Plaintiff was\n\n        authorised to represent the Defendants to take back the legal rights and interests that\n\n        the Defendants were entitled to under the joint venture projects.6. It was, inter alia, a term of the contract that Ms Shih would, on\n\n        behalf of the Defendants, remit a sum of US$550,000.00 or its equivalent in Francs to the\n\n        joint account of the Plaintiff and Sai-Kown Chu at Paris, France, by the end of December\n\n        1997.7. It was, inter alia, an express term of the contract that after\n\n        completion of the matter, Ms Shih shall, on behalf of the Defendants pay the balance of\n\n        US$450,000.00 within two months.8. It was agreed prior to the signing of the contract between the\n\n        Defendants and the Plaintiff that the Defendants would issue the Plaintiff with a Power of\n\n        Attorney giving the Plaintiff full authority to conduct the work for which he was\n\n        contracted to do.9. It was, inter alia, an implied term of the contract that the\n\n        Defendants would give the Plaintiff full assistance and cooperation to enable the\n\n        Plaintiff to perform his duties under the contract.10. Pursuant to the contract, the Defendants remitted the sum of\n\n        US$550,000 into the account.11. In performance of the contract, on behalf of the Defendants, the\n\n        Plaintiff engaged another party, the Shenzhen China Wealth Investment and Development Co\n\n        Ltd (hereinafter referred to as \"China Wealth\"), to settle the dispute and\n\n        recover the Defendants’ investment. The Plaintiff has so far, incurred expenses\n\n        amounting to US$900,000 in performance of his duties under the contract.12. In breach of the contract, the Defendants failed to give the\n\n        Plaintiff full assistance and cooperation by reason of which the Plaintiff was impeded in\n\n        the performance of the contract.PARTICULARS(a) The Defendants failed to provide full and accurate\n\n        information concerning the dispute which the Plaintiff was to resolve, as follows:-(i) The Defendants did not inform the Plaintiff that the Shenyang Wu Ai\n\n            Cloths City project involved raising funds from members of the public.(ii) The Defendants did not inform the Plaintiff that the funds raised\n\n            were not used for the development and construction of the project and that there were\n\n            doubts as to their actual usage.(b) The Defendant failed, neglected and/or refused to provide a Power\n\n        of Attorney which the Plaintiff required in order to perform the contract.13. By reason of the failure of the Defendants to provide full\n\n        assistance and cooperation and the Power of Attorney as aforesaid, the Plaintiff could not\n\n        proceed with the work for which he was engaged to do and has incurred expenses amounting\n\n        to US$900,000.00 as sums paid to engage China Wealth.AND the Plaintiff claims:(a) that the Defendants pay the Plaintiff US$900,000.00.(b) in the alternative, a declaration that the Defendants indemnify the\n\n        Plaintiff for all losses suffered by the Plaintiff as a result of the Defendants’\n\n        breach of contract.(c) damages(d) costs(e) Such further and/or other orders as this Honourable Court thinks\n\n        fit.\"THE DEFENCE5 The Defendants filed their Defence after having been served a 48-hour\n\nnotice to do so. In response to the Plaintiff’s Claim, the Defendants averred the\n\nfollowing additional express terms of the contract dated 19 December 1997:(1) if, within one year from the date of the contract, the Defendants\n\n  were unable to get back their rights and interests, the Plaintiff was to return the\n\n  US$550,000 (without interest) within three months; and(2) both parties would abide by the written agreement which was to take\n\n  effect upon signing.6 It was further pleaded as an implied term that the Plaintiff would\n\n\"make regular report to the Defendants of the progress and status of his work or\n\notherwise as and when requested by the Defendants\".7 The Defendants claimed that the Plaintiff was in repudiatory breach\n\nby failing to comply with the above implied term. On or about 27 April 1998, the\n\nDefendants accepted the repudiatory breaches and demanded the return of the US$550,000.\n\nThe Defendants denied any discussion or agreement on the requirement of a Power of\n\nAttorney as alleged in the Claim.8 The Plaintiff by his fax dated 14 May 1998 to the Defendants’\n\nlawyers in Paris admitted that he had not started any work. The Defendants then commenced\n\nlegal proceedings against the Plaintiff in Paris for the return of the US$550,000.THE DEFENDANTS’ CASE9 Shih Shia Wah, a director and shareholder of the Defendants, stated\n\nthat the action in Paris arose out of the same agreement as the one in the present action.\n\nThe US$550,000 was converted to French Francs and remitted to the Plaintiff and his\n\nwife’s joint-account in Paris. The Plaintiff did not intend to assist the Defendants\n\nand had used the said money instead to purchase a property in Paris.10 On 30 September 1998, a writ was issued in the Paris Commercial\n\nCourt for the return of the US$550,000. The Plaintiff’s accounts at BNP and at Banque\n\nSan Paolo in Paris were garnished. On 5 November 1998, the High Court in Paris granted a\n\nprovisional mortgage against the Plaintiff’s property in Paris and that was\n\nregistered on 18 November 1998. I was told that such a mortgage amounted to a Mareva\n\nInjunction against the property.11 The Plaintiff had until 29 September 1999 (an extended date) to file\n\nhis Defence in the Paris action but did not do so. The case was therefore adjourned to 10\n\nNovember 1999. The proceedings in Paris were close to conclusion.12 The Plaintiff had actually commenced an earlier action here in Suit\n\nNo. 2142 of 1998 on 24 November 1998. That also concerned the same agreement. It was\n\ncommenced one day before the Plaintiff was to have filed his pleading in the Paris action\n\nand one week after the registration of the provisional mortgage. Judgment in default of\n\nappearance was entered by the Plaintiff against the Defendants in the earlier suit but\n\nthat was subsequently set aside on 12 March 1999 because of defective service.13 The Plaintiff was ordered to re-serve the writ but did not do so. A\n\nnotice under O. 12 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court was taken out by the Defendants to require\n\nthe Plaintiff to serve the writ within 14 days or discontinue the action. No action was\n\ntaken and the Defendants accordingly applied to strike out the action.14 On 7 April 1999, the Court here ordered the Plaintiff to re-serve\n\nthe writ by 4 pm on 9 April 1999 failing which the action be dismissed. Costs of $350 were\n\nordered against the Plaintiff. Due to the continued inaction on the part of the Plaintiff,\n\nSuit No. 2142 of 1998 was finally dismissed on 13 April 1999.15 On 3 May 1999, the present action was commenced and, until the\n\nStatement of Claim was amended in September 1999, the claim was the same as that in the\n\nearlier Singapore action. The writ in the latter action was served on the Defendants only\n\nafter a similar notice under O. 12 r 8(1) of the Rules of Court had been issued.16 The Plaintiff had been avoiding the merits of the French action by\n\nabusing the procedure there to delay the action and by juxtaposing the two Singapore\n\nactions. He had also tried to sell the Paris property inspite of the provisional mortgage.",
        "THE PLAINTIFF’S CASE": "17 The Plaintiff, who stated his present address as being in Las Vegas,\n\nUSA, but who affirmed his affidavit on 4 November 1999 before a Notary Public in China,\n\nsaid that he had instructed his lawyers in France to challenge the jurisdiction of the\n\nFrench Court on the ground that Singapore was the proper forum for the trial. The French\n\nCourt has not decided this question. The Plaintiff’s French lawyers have advised that\n\nthe French Court did not have the jurisdiction to try this matter as it concerned an\n\nagreement signed in Singapore in the Chinese language for work to be performed in China.18 The merits of the French action have also not been decided and that\n\naction has progressed no further than the present one here. The French lawyers have also\n\nadvised that a Singapore judgment could, under certain conditions, be recognised and\n\nenforced in France.19 Most of the relevant documents in this case were in the Chinese\n\nlanguage. Under French law, the law of the contract was Singapore law. French law should\n\nnot be applied as the contract was made in Singapore, the Defendants were Singaporean and\n\nthe entire contract was to be performed in China. The contract was also in Chinese. When\n\nthe contract was entered into, French law was not contemplated at all. Even if Chinese law\n\nwas the proper law, the Singapore Court would be in a better position than the French\n\nCourt to apply such law.20 The Plaintiff resided presently in the USA while the Defendants were\n\na Singapore company and Shih Shia Wah also resided here. Most, if not at all, of the\n\nwitnesses would be from China and most of the evidence would relate to events there.21 The money paid to the Plaintiff did not have to be applied for any\n\nparticular purpose.22 He was prepared to furnish security for $30,000 up to the stage of\n\nsetting down and had made payment of all the costs ordered against him. He was serious\n\nabout proceeding in Singapore.",
        "THE DECISION OF THE COURT": "23 Paragraph 9 of the First Schedule in the Supreme Court of Judicature\n\nAct confers on the High Court:\"Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where\n\n  the matter in question in res judicata between the parties, or where by reason of\n\n  multiplicity of proceedings in any court or courts or by reason of a court in Singapore\n\n  not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought not to be continued.\"24 InThe Hooghly Mills Co Ltd v Seltron Pte Ltd[1995] 1 SLR 773, the Plaintiffs were a company incorporated in India and carrying on business in\n\nCalcutta while the Defendants were a company incorporated in Singapore. The Plaintiffs\n\nagreed to sell the Defendants two million hessian sugar bags with payment to be made by\n\nway of a bill of exchange drawn on the Defendants payable to the Vysya Bank Ltd. The bill\n\nwas dishonoured by non-payment when presented. The Defendants contended that the goods\n\ndelivered did not conform to specifications and were unmerchantable and commenced a suit\n\nin India in June 1993 against the Plaintiffs and Vysya Bank Ltd. The writ in that action\n\nwas not served on the Plaintiffs until 10 January 1994. On 16 October 1993, the Plaintiffs\n\ncommenced their action in Singapore. The Defendants did not file a Defence to the\n\nSingapore action but applied instead to stay the action on the grounds that Indian law was\n\nthe governing law of the transaction, that the transaction took place in India and the\n\nwitnesses were there and that there waslis alibi pendens.25 The Assistant Registrar there ordered a stay of the Singapore action\n\nwith liberty to apply to lift the stay should the Indian action be discontinued or stayed.\n\nThe Plaintiffs appealed. In allowing the appeal , Judith Prakash JC made the following\n\nobservations at page 780 of the report:\"(3) Lis alibi pendensThe approach which the court should take when one of the grounds\n\n  supporting an application for stay is that there is a pending action involving the same\n\n  parties and the same issues in a foreign forum was set out by Lord Goff inde Dampierre\n\n  v de Dampierreat pp 107-108 in the following words:\"Under the principle of forum non conveniens now applicable in\n\n  England as well as in Scotland, the court may exercise its discretion under its inherent\n\n  jurisdiction to grant a stay where ‘it is satisfied that there is some other\n\n  tribunal, having competent jurisdiction, in which the case may be tried more suitably for\n\n  the interests of the parties and for the ends of justice’: seeSim v Robinow[1892] 19 R (Ct of Sess) 665, 668, per Lord Kinnear. The effect is that the court in this\n\n  country looks first to see what factors there are which connect the case with another\n\n  forum. If, on the basis of that inquiry, the court concludes that there is another\n\n  available forum which, prima facie, is clearly more appropriate for the trial of the\n\n  action, it will ordinarily grant a stay, unless there are circumstances by reason of which\n\n  justice requires that a stay should nevertheless not be granted: see theSpiliadacase [1987] AC 460, 475-478. The same principle is applicable whether or not there are\n\n  other relevant proceedings already pending in the alternative forum: seeThe Abidin\n\n  Daver[1984] AC 398, 411, per Lord Diplock. However, the existence of such proceedings\n\n  may, depending on the circumstances, be relevant to the inquiry. Sometimes they may be of\n\n  no relevance at all, for example, if one party has commenced the proceedings for the\n\n  purpose of demonstrating the existence of a competent jurisdiction, or the proceedings had\n\n  not passed beyond the stage of the initiating process. But if for example, genuine\n\n  proceedings had been started and have not merely been started but have developed to the\n\n  stage where they have had some impact upon the dispute between the parties, especially if\n\n  such impact is likely to have a continuing effect, then this may be a relevant factor to\n\n  be taken into account when the foreign jurisdiction provides the appropriate forum for the\n\n  resolution of the dispute between the parties.\"\"26 On the facts, the learned Judge said (at page 781):\"It was true that the plaintiffs themselves\n\n  had not taken any further steps in the Indian proceedings in that they had not filed any\n\n  defence to the action. It was argued that the Indian proceedings would not have been\n\n  halted at the initial stage if the plaintiffs had taken active role in defending the\n\n  claim. In my view, however, the plaintiffs were not to be penalised for having\n\n  concentrated their efforts on removing the restraining order since their view of the\n\n  matter was that the action should proceed in Singapore rather than in India.…When I considered all the circumstances relating to the Indian\n\n  proceedings and the steps taken by the defendants therein, I agreed with the\n\n  plaintiffs’ submission that the Indian action was defensive in nature and that the\n\n  course of events indicated that there was no true desire on the part of the defendants to\n\n  litigate in India. In this regard, I noted that the Defendants’ claim as formulated\n\n  in the Indian courts substantially exceeds the plaintiffs’ claim for the price on the\n\n  goods. One would have expected a party with a claim for such a significant amount to have\n\n  vehemently pursued it in the Indian court instead of sitting on the matter for so long.\n\n  Further, while to say so might come perilously close to judicial chauvinism (to use Lord\n\n  Diplock’s phrase inThe Abidin Daver), I found it difficult to believe that a\n\n  Singaporean party would sincerely consider that its claim would be better dealt with in a\n\n  foreign court even though the foreign party concerned was willing to litigate in\n\n  Singapore. I had the clear impression that the defendants had ulterior motives in wanting\n\n  to shift this litigation from Singapore.Thus, whilst the court must always be concerned to try and avoid the\n\n  complications that arise when there are concurrent proceedings in different jurisdictions\n\n  involving the same parties and similar issues, in this particular case, I was not\n\n  convinced that the existence of the Indian proceedings was a positive factor making the\n\n  Indian court the more appropriate court to adjudicate the dispute.\"27 The learned Judge therefore concluded that the Defendants there had\n\nnot discharged the burden on them to show that the Indian Court was clearly and distinctly\n\nthe appropriate court for resolving the dispute. The Defendants’ subsequent appeal to\n\nthe Court of Appeal was dismissed.28 In a more recent decision,Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani\n\nStores Pte Ltd[1998] 1 SLR 253, the Court of Appeal pronounced on the principles\n\ngoverning an application to stay proceedings. This pronouncement appears compendiously in\n\nthe headnotes as the first holding as follows:\"The principles governing an application to\n\n  stay proceedings were clear and established. If a court concluded that there was some\n\n  other available forum which prima facie was clearly more appropriate for the trial of the\n\n  action, it would ordinarily grant a stay unless there were circumstances by reason of\n\n  which justice required that a stay should nevertheless not be granted. However, the mere\n\n  fact that a plaintiff had such a legitimate advantage for proceeding in Singapore was not\n\n  decisive and the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice had to be taken into\n\n  consideration.\"29 The contractual document in the present case was nothing more than a\n\none-page handwritten note in the Chinese language (save for the names of the parties, the\n\ndate and the currency) on paper provided by the Pan Pacific Hotel of Singapore. The terms\n\ntherein appear sufficiently from the pleadings and they should pose little difficulty to\n\nany Court studying them. No choice of law or of jurisdiction was stated. The applicable\n\nlaw would either be Singapore law or Chinese law. If it is Singapore law, obviously it\n\nwould be ideal that the matter be dealt with in this jurisdiction. If it is Chinese law,\n\nthis issue becomes a neutral one in that it would not matter whether the action is tried\n\nin Singapore or in Paris. There is no ground whatsoever to presume that either\n\njurisdiction would be better placed than the other to deal with Chinese law.30 The Defendants are based in Singapore and so is the Defendants’\n\nprincipal witness, Shih Shia Wah. However, she has unequivocally elected to travel to\n\nParis for the action to be tried there. The Plaintiff, holding a Honduran passport, with\n\nhis constantly changing address, appears to be a globetrotter and therefore the forum for\n\ntrial would be quite immaterial to him. However, he has not denied that his family is\n\nstill in Paris. His constant change of residence from one country to another appears\n\nsuspicious and was probably done to remove a connecting factor with the French\n\njurisdiction.31 He also claimed that practically all his witnesses would come from\n\nChina and there would be less difficulty and saving of costs if the action was tried here\n\nas Chinese is one of the official languages here and the witnesses would have to travel\n\nless and within the same time zone. I am not persuaded that Paris would not be able to\n\nprovide the same interpretation facilities as are available in Singapore. The longer\n\ntravel time and the different time zones are really relatively minor considerations.32 The denominated currency in the contract did not swing the balance\n\none way or the other. Indeed, the US dollar was converted into French Franc and remitted\n\nto the joint-account of the Plaintiff and his wife in Paris and it was not denied that the\n\nmoney was used to purchase the property in question.33 The Plaintiff also claimed that he had a personal or juridical\n\nadvantage in proceeding here in that he would be able to realize the fruits of his\n\njudgment here if successful. If the matter was litigated in Paris and the outcome was\n\nfavourable to him, he would not be able to register the French judgment here in Singapore\n\nunder our Reciprocal Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. This is where his sincerity in\n\nlitigating in Singapore is seriously in question. He has not explained his strange,\n\nlackadaisical attitude in the first Singapore action. Within three weeks after that action\n\nwas dismissed for non-prosecution, he commenced the present suit in which he had to be\n\ngoaded again by the Defendants to serve the writ. While he had declared his readiness to\n\nprovide security for costs and had been ordered by the Court to so provide, he had not\n\ndone so.34 On the other hand, the Defendants here have shown that they were\n\nentirely serious about proceeding in Paris. They have swiftly taken out applications to\n\npreserve the Plaintiff’s assets and were unable to move significantly further towards\n\nfinal resolution because of the delays caused by the Plaintiff’s procedural\n\nmanoeuvres. Having delivered two punches by way of the garnishee and provisional mortgage\n\napplications, the match would have got underway if the Plaintiff would only step into the\n\nring.35 I have no doubt that the Plaintiff was less than serious about\n\nproceeding with his action here and was merely playing one jurisdiction against the other.\n\nThis second Singapore action was nothing more than an instrument to persuade the French\n\nCourt not to assume jurisdiction over the case and consequently to lift the provisional\n\nmortgage on his Paris property.36 I was therefore of the view that the Paris action should proceed\n\nwhile the Singapore action should be stayed. If the French Court should decline\n\njurisdiction subsequently, the Plaintiff would be at liberty to restore the present action\n\nand proceed to final resolution of the dispute on the merits.TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
