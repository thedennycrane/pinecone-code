        "Introduction": "1 The applicant Buyer was found liable in an arbitration for non-acceptance of goods under a sale and purchase contract (the “Agreement”). It seeks to set aside the damages awarded, but does not challenge its liability for breach of contract. 2 The Buyer complains that the tribunal had awarded damages based on s 50(3) of the Sale of Goods Act (Cap 383, 1999 Rev Ed) (“SOGA”) although the respondent Seller’s position in the arbitration had been that s 50(3) did not apply, and it had claimed under s 50(2) instead. I shall refer to this as the “SOGA Issue”. 3 The setting-aside application was filed on the grounds that: (a) the Buyer was unable to present its case, under Art 34(2)(a)(ii) of the Model Law read with s 3 of the International Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 2002 Rev Ed) (“IAA”); and (b) there was a breach of the rules of natural justice in connection with the making of the award by which the Buyer’s rights have been prejudiced, under s 24(b) of the IAA. 4 The Buyer thereafter also submitted that the tribunal had exceeded its jurisdiction, another ground for setting-aside: Art 34(2)(a)(iii) of the Model Law. This ground was, however, not mentioned in the originating summons, affidavits, or written submissions – it was first raised in oral submissions at the hearing of the application. Indeed, the SOGA Issue itself was first raised in those oral submissions, and it then dominated the hearing of this application, with the Buyer’s other reasons for setting-aside receding into the background. 5 I find that the none of the grounds for setting-aside is established, and that the Buyer has not suffered prejudice from the matters complained of. I thus dismiss the setting-aside application. 6 I deal first with the SOGA Issue, and then with the Buyer’s other reasons for setting-aside (essentially that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions).",
        "The SOGA Issue": "",
        "The goods": "7 The goods in question are optical fiber preforms: rods made of synthetic quartz doped with germanium; preforms are used to produce optical fiber, which would then be bundled to form optical fiber cables for sale to end users.1Foot Note 1×Award exhibited at Agreed Bundle of Documents (“ABOD”), 999 (“Award”), paras 122 and 236. 8 The tribunal referred to the preforms which the Buyer had agreed to buy, and the Seller to sell, as “Preforms” (with an uppercase “P”), as distinct from “preforms” (with a lowercase “p”) being “a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables”.2Foot Note 2×Award, paras 74 and 230.I use these terms in the same way. 9 The distinction matters because – as the Seller contended and the tribunal found – once preforms were manufacturedfor the Buyer(becoming the Preforms under the Agreement), they were customised for the Buyer’s requirements: they were specifically designed by the Seller for the Buyer and could no longer be considered generic, once manufactured.3Foot Note 3×Award, para 231.",
        "The Buyer’s breach": "10 The tribunal found the Buyer to be in breach of contract, in its non-acceptance of shipments of Preforms in the period from February to December 2019.4Foot Note 4×Award, para 177.",
        "The Seller’s claims": "11 Part VI of the SOGA deals with actions for breach of contract. In that Part, ss 49 and 50 address the seller’s remedies: an action for the price of the goods under s 49, and an action for damages for the buyer’s non-acceptance of the goods under s 50. 12 In the present case, the primary relief sought by the Seller was the price of the goods, under s 49 of the SOGA. The tribunal found against the Seller on this. 13 The Seller, however, succeeded in its alternative claim for damages under s 50 of the SOGA, which provides as follows: Damages for non-acceptance 50.—(1) Where the buyer wrongfully neglects or refuses to accept and pay for the goods, the seller may maintain an action against him for damages for non-acceptance. (2) The measure of damages is the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract. (3) Where there is an available market for the goods in question, the measure of damages is prima facie to be ascertained by the difference between the contract price and the market or current price of the goods at the time or times when they ought to have been accepted or (if no time was fixed for acceptance) at the time of the refusal to accept. 14 The Seller had claimed damages under s 50 of the SOGA based on the measure of damages under s 50(2),ie, “the estimated loss directly and naturally resulting, in the ordinary course of events, from the buyer’s breach of contract”.5Foot Note 5×Statement of claim (ABOD 128) at paras 78–87 (ABOD 159–161).The Seller specifically considered s 50(3) of the SOGA, and asserted that itdid not apply: s 50(3) applied “[w]here there is an available market for the goods”, and there wasno available market for the Preformsas they were “specially designed and produced to meet [the Buyer’s] specifications”.6Foot Note 6×Statement of claim, paras 84–87 (ABOD 161).Thus, the Seller contended that “there are no ready buyers available to purchase the shipments of [the Preforms] which [the Buyer] has refused to accept in breach of contract. Accordingly, section 50(2) shall apply to [the Seller’s] claim for damages.”",
        "The Buyer’s defence": "15 The Buyer denied being in breach of contract. It said that there was an “astronomical” drop in prices of optical fiber towards the end of 2018, and that because of that, the price of preforms reduced astronomically.7Foot Note 7×Defence (ABOD 166), paras 68–73 (ABOD 189–191).It contended that this had frustrated the Agreement.8Foot Note 8×Defence, para 177 (ABOD 222). 16 The Buyer also disputed the Seller’s assertion that there was no available market for the Preforms. The Buyer asserted that the Preforms were generic,9Foot Note 9×Defence, paras 9, 46 (ABOD 171, 184).so there was an available market for the Preforms,10Foot Note 10×Defence, paras 48–50 (ABOD 184).and s 50(3) of the SOGA would apply.11Foot Note 11×Defence, paras 108–111 (ABOD 203–204).The Buyer further contended that damages claimed by the Seller would be kept at a minimum as it had not acted reasonably to mitigate its losses; and if it had chosen not to sell any preforms at all in the relevant period, it would not have suffered any loss.12Foot Note 12×Defence, para 111 (ABOD 204).",
        "The Seller’s reply": "17 In its reply to the Buyer’s defence, the Seller elaborated on why the Preforms were not generic,13Foot Note 13×Reply (ABOD 233) paras 104–112 (ABOD 276–279).and reiterated its claim for damages pursuant to the measure of damages under s 50(2), not s 50(3), of the SOGA.14Foot Note 14×Reply, paras 95–97 (ABOD 273–274).",
        "The Seller’s use of s 50(3) of the SOGA": "18 Although the Seller’s pleaded case was that s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply as there was no available market for the Preforms, the Seller sought to claim damages under s 50(2) using a measure of damages similar to that under s 50(3). 19 Specifically, the Seller contended that it should be awarded damages on the basis of the contract price for the Preforms, less a “Hypothetical Market Price” derived using the market price of optical fiber as a comparable product. The tribunal awarded damages against the Buyer on this basis. 20 Although the Seller took reference from s 50(3) of the SOGA in formulating the measure of damages claimed, its pleaded position was that s 50(3) did not apply as there was no available market for the Preforms. The Seller’s witness statements 21 In the first witness statement of the Seller’s witness Mr [X],15Foot Note 15×ABOD 346.he stated at para 62 that the Preforms supplied to the Buyer under the Agreement are tailor-made, and it was difficult to sell them to any other company without re-processing, and therefore “in the strict sense of the term, there is no ‘market price’ of such products to speak of.”16Foot Note 16×ABOD 372. 22 In para 69 of that witness statement, Mr [X] then referred to s 50(3) of the SOGA, saying he had been advised that if there is an available market for a product, the difference between the market price and the contract price was considered to be theprima facieamount of damages. He said that the Seller thus regarded the difference between (a) the “market” price of preforms (calculated by adjusting the contract price of the Preforms by the rate of decrease in the price of optical fiber) – the “Hypothetical Market Price”; and (b) the contract price of the Preforms, to be “an indicator of damages incurred” by the Seller. 23 In Mr [X]’s second witness statement,17Foot Note 17×ABOD 423.he maintained that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement. At paras 21–27,18Foot Note 18×ABOD 431–434.he said that the Preforms manufactured for the Buyer cannot be considered to be generic products. At para 25 he said, “the preforms [the Seller] supplies to [the Buyer] are different from the preforms [the Seller] supplies to other optical fiber manufacturers. Accordingly, the preforms [the Seller] manufactures for [the Buyer] cannot simply be sold to other customers as they are without any re-processing”. At para 27 he then said, “[the Buyer’s witness] further states that there is an available market for preforms. Insofar as [the Buyer’s witness] is suggesting that the preforms which [the Buyer] has refused to accept could be sold to other optical fiber manufacturers, I disagree.” The lists of issues 24 In the Seller’s list of issues,19Foot Note 19×ABOD 440.it did not cite s 50(3) of the SOGA. Instead, it referred to s 50(2) in its framing of Issue 1(e)(ii):20Foot Note 20×ABOD 442. (e) whether, as an alternative to the price of the shipments … [the Seller] is entitled to damages under section 50(1) of the SOGA arising from [the Buyer’s] breach of the Agreement. In particular: … (ii) whether [the Seller] has suffered any loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptanceunder section 50(2) of the SOGA… [emphasis added] 25 On this point, the formulation in the Buyer’s list of issues was similar – Issue 1(e)(ii) was: (e) whether, as an alternative to the price of the shipments … [the Seller] is entitled to damages under section 50 of the SOGA arising from [the Buyer’s] breach of the Agreement. In particular: … (ii) Whether [the Seller] has suffered any loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptance … 26 Although the Buyer did not expressly cite s 50(2) of the SOGA, it formulated the above issue using the phrase “loss directly and naturally resulting”, which is the measure of damages under s 50(2). The oral opening and closing submissions of the Seller’s counsel 27 In the oral opening of the Seller’s counsel, he stated that there was no available market for preforms, even generally.21Foot Note 21×ABOD 547 line 10 to 548 line 13.He then said that “if there is a market”, there was s 50(3) of the SOGA; but even under s 50(2) of the SOGA, a“similar kind of quantification approach” [emphasis added] was not excluded.22Foot Note 22×ABOD 549 line 25 to 549 line 7. 28 In the Seller’s counsel’s oral closing, he maintained that the Seller “claim[ed] for damagesunder section 50(2) of the SOGA, which allows a wide range of methods of calculation.” [emphasis added] He went on to say:23Foot Note 23×ABOD 742 line 3 to 743 line 13. We recognise an inherent difficulty in ascertaining the appropriate measure of damages in this case becausethere is no available market for preforms. Even though the raw material for the preform is generic, there has been no sales opportunity at the relevant time for the client, which means that there has beenno available market in reality. … [The Seller] came up with the hypothetical market price approach,getting a hint from section 50(3) of SOGA. This approach is reasonable because there is a strong correlation between the preform price and the fiber price … We submit that since section 50(2) and 50(3) of SOGA are not mutually exclusive,the similar approach as set out in section 50(3) can be taken, even under 50(2), if no other preferable calculation method is readily available. [emphasis added] 29 As at the end of the merits hearing, the Seller’s position was thus: (a) there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement; (b) there was no available market for preforms, even generally; (c) on its terms, s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply: it would apply if there was an available market for the goods in question, but there was no such available market; (d) the Seller claimed damages under s 50(2) of the SOGA; and (e) although the Seller claimed under s 50(2) of the SOGA, and there was no available market for the Preforms (or preforms generally), with a hint from s 50(3) it had used an approach similar to that under s 50(3) – that being the contract price less the Hypothetical Market Price. The Seller’s written closing submissions 30 In the Seller’s written closing submissions,24Foot Note 24×ABOD 883.however, it submitted at paras 176–177: 176. [The Seller’s] position is thatthere is an“available market” for preformsas a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables, such thatsection 50(3) of the SOGA appliesin determining [the Seller’s] measure of damages. 177. [The Seller] has applied the measure of loss under section 50(3) of the SOGA as comprising the price of preforms under the Agreement less the hypothetical market price of preforms (“Hypothetical Market Price approach”) … [emphasis in original in bold; emphasis added in italics] 31 The Seller’s para 176 submission that therewas an available marketfor preforms generally, contradicted its counsel’s earlier oral submission (in his oral opening and oral closing) that therewasno available marketfor preforms, even generally (as noted in the preceding section). 32 Moreover, taking at face value the Seller’s submission that “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies”, that was not the position it had pleaded and maintained till that point, which was: s 50(3) did not apply; but it could, in claiming under s 50(2), use an approach similar to that under s 50(3). 33 The Seller nevertheless continued to assert that the Preforms under the contract were not generic.25Foot Note 25×ABOD 934, para 184; see also ABOD 943, para 211(a).This position, which the Seller maintained throughout the arbitration, would mean that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement (and consequently no market price for those Preforms) and so s 50(3) of the SOGA would not apply. Consistent with this, the Seller’s para 176 submission referred to an available market for “preforms as a class of goods”, rather than to an available market for the Preforms under the Agreement. 34 The Seller concluded that part of its written submissions as follows: “In conclusion, the only two components that are relevant for determining [the Seller’s] claim for damages are (a) the contract price of preforms under the Agreement and (b) thehypothetical market priceof such preforms.”26Foot Note 26×ABOD 935, para 187.[emphasis added] 35 Given the Seller’s position that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement, it used the Hypothetical Market Price – ahypothetical price, from ahypothetical market. That isnotthe measure of damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA, which requires “an available market for the goods in question”,ie, the Preforms under the Agreement, and compares the “contract price and themarket or current priceof the goods” [emphasis added]. 36 It thus appears that the Seller was still maintaining its claim under s 50(2) of the SOGA using an approach similar to that under s 50(3), rather than making some claim directly under s 50(3) whilst taking the inconsistent position that there was no available market for the goods in question,ie, the Preforms under the Agreement. I shall return to this when I review the award, for the tribunal essentially accepted the Seller’s contentions in awarding damages (see [47]–[68] below). The Buyer’s written closing submissions 37 In the Buyer’s written closing submissions27Foot Note 27×ABOD 818.(which were put in concurrently with the Seller’s written closing submissions),28Foot Note 28×ABOD 883.the Buyer submitted at para 212:29Foot Note 29×ABOD 869. In the present dispute [the Seller] has sought the relief of price of monthly shipments of 3000kg. of [Preforms] from February to December 2019 under Section 49(2) of USD [XYZ] and in the alternative, damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA of USD [ABC] based on the computation of loss of profit on the basis of a hypothetical market price of preform ([Preform]). 38 The Buyer described the Seller’s claim based on the Hypothetical Market Price as being for “damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA”, and responded to that. 39 Why was the Buyer referring to the Seller’s claim in those terms, when the Seller’s position hitherto had been that it was claiming under s 50(2) of the SOGA, but using an approach similar to that under s 50(3)? The Buyer had yet to see the Seller’s para 176 submission that “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies”, yet it characterised the Seller’s damages claim as being for “damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA”. Furthermore, the Buyer did not say that such a claim was not open to the Seller on its pleaded case. 40 Perhaps the Buyer was simply referring to the Seller’s claim under s 50(2) of the SOGA using an approach similar to that under s 50(3), as a claim for “damages under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. If so, might the Seller have done likewise, in saying “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies” in its para 176 submission? 41 In any event, it is clear that the Buyer had the opportunity to respond to a claim for “damages under Section 50(3) of SOGA”, as the Buyer put it in its written closing submissions. The Buyer’s rebuttal submissions 42 There was also a round of written reply/rebuttal submissions. 43 In the Buyer’s rebuttal,30Foot Note 30×ABOD 947.it did not say that paras 176–177 of the Seller’s written submissions articulated a claim that was not open to the Seller on its pleaded case. 44 Instead, the Buyer responded to paras 161–187 of the Seller’s written closing submissions (which included paras 176–177) by saying, “[the Buyer] has already explained numerous flaws relating to irrelevant market, imperfect correlation, etc. in the computation of damages provided by [the Seller] in the closing submissions.”31Foot Note 31×ABOD 967, para 84.At para 86 of the Buyer’s rebuttal,32Foot Note 32×ABOD 968.the Buyer specifically addressed the Seller’s para 176 submission by reiterating that there was an available market for Preforms under the Agreement, and submitting that the Buyer’s reliance on legal authorities in cases where there was no available market, was inapplicable and misplaced. Evidently the Buyer did not understand the Seller’s para 176 submission to mean that the Seller was claiming under s 50(3) of the SOGA (which requires an available market for the Preforms) – the Buyer knew the Seller maintained that there was no available market for those Preforms.",
        "The tribunal’s findings": "45 The tribunal found the Buyer to be in breach of contract, for non-acceptance of the Preforms under the Agreement for the period from February to December 2019. 46 The tribunal awarded the Seller damages based on the Seller’s proposed measure: contract price of the Preforms, less the Hypothetical Market Price. The tribunal’s references to s 50(3) of the SOGA 47 At para 137 of the award, the tribunal set out a list of issues, including “[w]hether [the Seller] has suffered any loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptance [under s 50(2) of the SOGA]”.33Foot Note 33×Award, para 137(e)(v) (ABOD 1033).The tribunal addressed this issue at paras 222–258 of the award.34Foot Note 34×Award, paras 222–258 (ABOD 1057–1071).In doing so, however, the tribunal cited s 50(3) of the SOGA at paras 230–231, 234, 254–257, and 258(d) of the award. I set out paras 230–234, 252–258 of the award below: 230.I accept thatthe measure of loss under Section 50(3) of the SOGAis the Price of Preforms under the Agreement less the market price of preforms, what[the Seller] describes as the Hypothetical Market Price. [The Seller’s]position is that there is an available market for preforms as a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables, but even if there is no available market, [the Seller] is free to compute what it considers to be the value of those goods to it, including by reference to comparable products. [The Buyer] also submits that there is a market for preforms, but does not agree with either [the Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price or that [the Seller] put forward its own evidence of market price. I accept both Parties’ common position that there is an available market for preforms. I do not find it helpful to go by [the Seller’s] alternative argument that [the Seller] is free to compute what it considers to be the value of those goods to it, given the lack of information and evidence on what this might be. The case cited by [the Seller],Avra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd, is a case where the High Court found that there was a market for the goods in question, and used the market price of a comparable product as evidence. I shall return to this case below. 231. Some adjustments have to be made. First, the contract Price for Preforms under the Agreement is the price for preforms manufactured according to the specifications in the Agreement. I accept [the Seller’s] evidence that, once the preforms are manufactured for [the Buyer], they are customised for [the Seller’s] requirements. They were specially designed by [the Seller] for [the Buyer] and can no longer be considered generic, once they are manufactured. However, where they have not been manufactured for [the Buyer], the raw materials can be made into preforms to meet any customer’s requirements. In that sense, [the Seller] says, there is a market for preforms generally. I quote [the Seller’s] explanation in the Claimant’s Closing Submissions: 176. [The Seller’s] position is that there is an “available market” for preforms as a class of goods that is used to produce optical fiber and fiber cables, such thatsection50(3) of the SOGA appliesin determining[the Seller’s]measure of damages. … 183. [The Seller’s] position stated at paragraph 176 above (i.e. that there is an “available market”), however, does not mean that the preforms of the type and specifications that [the Seller] supplies to [the Buyer] are “generic”. This is because while the raw materials used to produce preforms are “generic” (i.e. silicon dioxide and germanium dioxide), as explained in Mr. [X]’s evidence, [the Seller] produces preforms specifically customised to suit each customer’s drawing apparatus and conditions, and requirements in terms of optical characteristics. Consequently, any adjustment to a single feature such as length, outer diameter or Mode Field Diameter would mean that a particular preform can be used by one customer but not another. 232. Secondly, there is no data about market preform prices. Mr [X] testified that there is no “market price” for the Preforms to be supplied to [the Buyer] because these are tailor-made. [The Seller] submits that the Tribunal should take the spot market price for spot optical fiber because contracts for preforms are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and kept confidential: 186. [The Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price approach is entirely consistent with the factual circumstances relevant to the preform and optical fiber market. Preforms are products that only a small number of companies worldwide are able to produce, and which can only be used for the purpose of producing optical fiber and fiber cable. Therefore, [the Seller’s] Hypothetical Market Price approach is the reasonable method for computing damages arising from [the Buyer’s] breach of contract. In addition, contracts for preform supply and purchase are negotiated on a case-by-case basis and kept strictly confidential, including prices of preform under long-term, short-term or spot basis contracts. For this reason, even in the [business analysis] reports, there are no data about the preform prices while the spot fiber prices are reported. 233. [The Seller] submits that optical fiber is the most appropriate comparable product to preform given that optical fiber is, in fact, the final product melted down and drawn from preform. The market price of optical fiber is the closest and most direct evidence of the price of preform sold on a spot basis in any given time. 234. I accept that it is in principle permissible to look at the market price of comparable products where there is no market price for the specific goods in question. As cited by [the Seller], the Singapore High Court inAvra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution(Singapore) Pte Ltdrelied on evidence of the market price of 3800 NAR coal “as the closest and most direct evidence of the market price of 3400 NAR coal”in awardingdamages for non-acceptance of a shipment of 3400 NAR coalunder Section 50(3) of theSOGAbecause there was no available market for 3400 NAR coal.In that case, both experts were agreed that coal with a calorific value of 3400 NAR was treated as the commercial equivalent of coal with a calorific value of 3800 GAR. … 252. By PO No. 4, [the Seller] had been ordered to produce any communications between [the Seller] and its customers and prospective customers in relation to the [Preforms] which had not been accepted by [the Buyer], if any such communications exist. 253. [The Seller] did not produce any such communications. Mr [X] testified that for the period from February to December 2019, [the Seller’s] customers could only purchase what they were already bound by contract to purchase. They were unable to purchase any more preforms and [The Seller] was unable to sell any additional volume for this period of time. The market situation was such that [the Seller’s] customers could not purchase any additional volume. Mr [X] further testified that the supply that [the Seller] made to its customer in [Country A] was based on a long-term agreement. [the Seller] was unable to acquire any new customers during this period of time. [The Buyer] submits that Mr [X]’s statement that [the Seller] was unable to convince its customers to buy additional volume is unsubstantiated and [the Seller] took no possible measures to mitigate and reduce the quantum of damages. 254. [The Seller’s] failure to produce communications in which it tried to find buyers for preforms during the relevant period means that it cannot prove the efforts that it took to find buyers.This does not mean thatitsclaim under Section 50(3) of the SOGAfails or has to be reduced. I accept [the Seller’s]submission that the principle of mitigation isalready assumed within the measure of loss in Section 50(3) of the SOGA. 255. Benjamin’s Sale of Goods (10th Edition) says as follows: The normal rule stated in s.50(3)incorporates the common law established beforethe Act, viz. when the buyer fails both to pay the price and to accept the goods, the seller’s damages are calculated by deducting from the contract price the market price at the time and place fixed by the contract for acceptance. The rationale of the statutory provisions is to provide a straightforward and readily applicable measure of damages which will enable the innocent party to be put into the same financial position as it would have been in had the contract been performed and which does not depend upon the action actually taken by the innocent party ... The doctrine of mitigation is one of the bases of this principle[i.e. section 50(3)]:it is assumed that with this additional amount of money [i.e. damages] the seller could, by selling in the market at the current price, put himself into the same financial position he would have been in had the contract been performed according to its terms. 256. At footnote 531, Benjamin cited the following authorities: Butifs.50(3) of the 1979 Act applies, the claimant need not satisfy the requirements of reasonable mitigation:Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc v Maclaine Watson &Co Ltd (No. 2)[1990] 3 All E.R. 723 at 726. InAir Sutdios (Lyndhurst) Ltd v LombardNorth Central Plc[2012} EWHC 3162 (QB); [2013] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 63 at [93] it was said that the rationale of the statutory provisions is to provide a straightforward and readily applicable measure of damages which will enable the innocent party to be put into the same financial position as it would have been in had the contract been performed and which does not depend upon the action actually taken by the innocent party. 257. These authorities make sense. The starting point for [the Seller’s] loss is that it has not been paid the contract price. One starts with that whole contract price. But if [the Seller] does what is reasonable, it will try to find alternative buyers for the preforms. That is the mitigation aspect.Whether or not it in fact finds alternative buyers,Section 50(3) of theSOGAassumes that it would have done so and procured alternative buyers at the marketprice during the relevant period. Therefore, instead of being able to claim the entire contract price, [the Seller] can only claim the difference between the contract price and the market price, whether or not it has actually managed to sell the preform at the market price.Based on authorities and logic, there has already been an assumption of mitigationbuilt intothe measure of loss in Section 50(3) of the SOGAand it is inappropriate tomake any further deductions from [the Seller’s]computation of loss under that section. 258. In conclusion, with regard to damages, I find that: a) [The Seller] has suffered loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptance of the shipments; b) The Preforms sold by [the Seller] to [the Buyer] are not generic, but the raw materials for their manufacture are generic and the preforms can be manufactured to any customer’s specifications; c) There is an available market for preform, as submitted by both Parties; d) [The Seller’s] damages should not be reduced by reason of any failure to mitigate, asthis is not required under Section 50(3) of the SOGA; e) Although [the Seller] was not ready with the February 2019 shipment of Preforms, it does not preclude [the Seller] from claiming damages for the difference between the contract price and the market price; and f) [The Seller] is entitled to damages under Section 50 of the SOGA for USD [ABC] for the period from February to December 2019. [emphasis added] 48 Do those references to s 50(3) of the SOGA show that the tribunal purported to award damages under s 50(3) when the Seller’s pleaded position in its statement of claim was that s 50(3) did not apply? 49 In answering that question, the award should be read supportively, in a manner which is likely to uphold it rather than to destroy it:Soh Beng Tee & Co Pte Ltd v Fairmount Development Pte Ltd[2007] 3 SLR(R) 86 (“Soh Beng Tee”) at [59]. It is not the function of the court to assiduously comb an arbitral award microscopically in attempting to determine if there was any blame or fault in the arbitral process (Soh Beng Teeat [65(f)]); the court should not nit-pick at the award (TMM Division Maritima SA de CV v Pacific Richfield Marine PteLtd[2013] 4 SLR 972 at [45]). 50 Asking whether the tribunal awarded damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA begs the question: did the tribunal find s 50(3) to apply? In turn, one must ask: did the tribunal find that the Preforms under the Agreement were generic, such that there was an available market for them? Section 50(3) of the SOGA would only apply if there were an available market for the Preforms under the Agreement. 51 The issues framed by the tribunal at para 137 of the award included the following sub-issues, under Issue (e): (i) Whether Preforms sold by [the Seller] to [the Buyer] are generic products or were specially designed by [the Seller] for [the Buyer]; (ii) Whether there has been an available market accessible to [the Seller] to sell such Preform at the relevant time or whether there is an available market for preform … 52 The tribunal’s findings on these issues were summarised at paras 258(b) and (c) of the award: b) The Preforms sold by [the Seller] to [the Buyer] are not generic, but the raw materials for their manufacture are generic and the preforms can be manufactured to any customer’s specifications; c) There is an available market for preform, as submitted by both Parties … 53 The tribunal (at paras 231 and 258(b) of the award)35Foot Note 35×Award (ABOD 1060 and 1071).agreed with the Seller that the Preforms under the Agreement were customised for the Buyer’s requirements; they were specially designed by the Seller for the Buyer and could no longer be considered generic, once they were manufactured. Furthermore, at para 232 of the award, the tribunal accepted the Seller’s evidence that there was no “market price” for the Preforms under the Agreement because they were tailor-made.36Foot Note 36×Award, para 232 (ABOD 1060). 54 These were the points the Seller had raised in its pleadings and evidence, to contend that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement, and so s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply, for there was no “available market for the goods in question”. 55 The tribunal’s findings are thus to the effect that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement, but that there was an available market for “preforms as a class of goods”. It should follow from that, that the tribunal accepted the Seller’s pleaded position that s 50(3) of the SOGA did not apply, and rejected the Buyer’s pleaded position that it applied. 56 The Buyer however points to para 254 of the award, where the tribunal referred to the Seller’s “claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”; and to para 231 of the award which quotes para 176 of the Seller’s written closing submissions: “section 50(3) of the SOGA applies in determining [the Seller’s] measure of damages”. 57 Nevertheless, thefirstreference to s 50(3) of the SOGA in the relevant section of the award, is in para 130 where the tribunal referred to “themeasure of lossunder s 50(3) of the SOGA” [emphasis added], which the tribunal accepted was the price of Preforms under the Agreement less the Hypothetical Market Price. 58 The Seller had put forward that measure of damages pursuant to s 50(2) of the SOGA, not s 50(3), all the while maintaining that s 50(3) did not apply as there was no available market for the Preforms. Indeed, the very contention that there was no available market for the Preforms led to the Seller coming up with the Hypothetical Market Price using the price of a comparable product – optical fiber. 59 Thesecondreference to s 50(3) of the SOGA, in para 231 of the award, is in similar vein. There, the tribunal quoted para 176 of the Seller’s written closing submissions in conjunction with para 183 of the same submissions (which explains the reference in para 176 to there being “an ‘available market’ for preforms as a class of goods”). Paragraph 183 of those submissions stated that the Seller maintained that the Preforms under the Agreement were not generic, although the raw materials used to produce them were generic. There was an “available market” for preforms as a class of goods, but no “available market” for the Preforms under the Agreement. Thus explained, the Seller’s para 176 submission was not a contention that s 50(3) applies in the sense of there being an available market for the Preforms under the Agreement – it was a contention that the Seller could use a measure of damages like that under s 50(3), but substituting the Hypothetical Market Price for the market price of the Preforms (for there was neither a market, nor a market price for the Preforms). 60 Thethirdreference to s 50(3) of the SOGA was in para 234 of the award, where the tribunal citedAvra Commodities Pte Ltd v China Coal Solution (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2019] SGHC 287 (“Avra Commodities”) as a case in which damages were awarded “under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. Indeed, damages were awarded under s 50(3) inAvra Commodities, for the court found at para 128 of the judgment therewasan available market for the goods in question (3400 NAR coal), stating: “In my view, there was an available market for the three cargoes at the relevant time.” In that case, although there was anavailable marketfor 3400 NAR coal, there were no transactions for that grade of coal from which directly to derive itsmarket price– thus the court derived that from the price of a comparable product (3800 GAR coal). 61 The tribunal did say in para 234 of the award thatAvra Commoditieswas a case where there was “no available market”; however, earlier at para 230 of the award the tribunal said that inAvra Commodities“the High Court had found thatthere was a marketfor the goods in question” [emphasis added] (as indeed the court had). I resolve this inconsistency by regarding the reference in para 234 to “no available market” as an aberration; possibly the tribunal meant “no available market price” and simply omitted the word “price”. 62 It is only thefourthreference to s 50(3) of the SOGA, in para 254 of the award, that mentions the Seller’s “claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. Given the preceding references, though, I regard that as merely short form for the measure of damages put forward by the Seller,ie, contract price less Hypothetical Market Price. The tribunal was not saying that s 50(3) of the SOGA applies (for which there needed to be an available market for the good in question) – he had agreed with the Seller that there was no available market for those goods, namely the Preforms under the Agreement. 63 Thefifth to seventhreferences to s 50(3) of the SOGA are in paras 255–256 of the award, where the tribunal referred toBenjamin’s Sale of Goods(Michael Bridge gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, 10th Ed, 2017) (“Benjamin’s Sale of Goods”) for its commentary on mitigation in the context of themeasure of damagesunder s 50(3). 64 In similar vein are theeighth and ninthreferences to s 50(3) of the SOGA – in para 257 of the award, where the tribunal reasoned that an assumption of mitigation is built into “themeasure of lossin Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. 65 Thetenth and finalreference to s 50(3) of the SOGA is in para 258(d) of the award, where the tribunal stated, “[the Seller’s] damages should not be reduced by reason of any failure to mitigate, as this is not required under Section 50(3) of the SOGA”. That follows on from the discussion in paras 255–257: the tribunal was referring to themeasure of damagesit was awarding in the present case, namely contract price less Hypothetical Market Price, which it reasoned (with reference toBenjamin’s Sale of Goods) had an assumption of mitigation built into it, as did the measure of damages under s 50(3). Did the tribunal award damages under s 50(3) of the SOGA, or under s 50(2)? 66 There are indeed infelicitous references to s 50(3) of the SOGA in the award: “the measure of loss under Section 50(3) of the SOGA” in para 230; “no available market” (in relation toAvra Commodities) in para 234; and “claim under Section 50(3) of the SOGA” in para 254. On the whole, however, it is clear that the tribunal accepted the Seller’s proposed measure of loss (contract price less Hypothetical Market Price) while also accepting the Seller’s contention that there was no available market for the goods in question (the Preforms under the Agreement), and so s 50(3) did not apply. 67 This is not a case where the tribunal found s 50(3) of the SOGA applicable and so awarded damages under it. On the contrary, the tribunal found s 50(3) inapplicable. The tribunal then used an analogous measure: contract price less Hypothetical Market Price (not contract price less current or market price, as stipulated in s 50(3)). That the tribunal awarded damages under s 50(2) is reinforced by para 258 (a) of the award: “[The Seller] has suffered loss directly and naturally resulting from [the Buyer’s] wrongful non-acceptance of the shipments”. That is the general measure of damages under s 50(2). 68 The Seller had contended that those damages could be reckoned by way of the difference between contract price and Hypothetical Market Price, and the tribunal accepted that. That specific measure of damages was fully canvassed between the parties, as was the related issue of whether the goods under the contract were generic or there was an available market for them. Based on my reading of the award in the context of the pleadings, evidence and submissions, there was no breach of natural justice, or excess of jurisdiction. I nevertheless analyse these grounds more fully below.",
        "Is setting-aside warranted?": "124 In respect of these other issues, I find that the Buyer was not unable to present its case, nor was there a breach of natural justice. Further, the Buyer has not suffered prejudice from the matters complained of. 125 I understand the Buyer to be alleging excess of jurisdiction only in relation to the SOGA Issue, but for avoidance of doubt, I find that the tribunal did not exceed its jurisdiction on any of the other issues either.",
        "Had the tribunal failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions?": "109 The other reasons put forward by the Buyer to justify setting-aside were: (a) the tribunal failed to deal with the Buyer’s objection in respect of the “market price” aspect of the Seller’s damages claim; (b) the tribunal relatedly failed to consider the Seller’s factual evidence and admissions that there was in fact a market for the Preforms under the Agreement; and (c) the tribunal failed to address the fundamental problems with the hypothetical market price, notably that it dealt with data from [Country B], not [Country A]. 110 The common thread is: the Buyer seeks to infer from the award that the tribunal had treated the Buyer’s various objections as withdrawn and/or conceded (see para 80 of the Buyer’s written submissions). The Buyer tries to draw a parallel between the present case andFront Row Investment Holdings(Singapore) Pte Ltd v Daimler South East Asia Pte Ltd[2010] SGHC 80 (“Front Row”), where the tribunal failed to consider a number of the points pleaded, because it thought the respondent had ceased to rely on them. 111 InFront Row, there was an explicit indication that the tribunal had failed to consider the points in question: the tribunal said so. That is not so in the present case. The Buyer relies on an inference from the award, and as the Court of Appeal held inAKN and another v ALC and others and other appeals[2015] 3 SLR 488 at [46], this inference “if it is to be drawn at all, must be shown to beclear and virtually inescapable” [emphasis added]: see furtherCIX v CIY[2021] SGHC 53 at [9]–[15]. 112 In the present case, I find that it is not a “clear and virtually inescapable” inference from the award that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions. Instead, it appeared that the tribunal had considered those contentions, and rejected them.",
        "The tribunal considered the Buyer’s objection to the “market price” aspect of the Seller’s damages claim": "113 The Buyer argues that the tribunal failed to deal with its fundamental argument that there was in fact a market for the Preforms under the Agreement (as opposed to preforms generally), and correspondingly, in failing to find that the Seller had failed to prove the applicable market price of that market. 114 This is not borne out by the award: (a) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Preforms under the Agreement were generic, finding to the contrary at paras 231 and 258(b). (b) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Seller had failed to prove the applicable market price of the Preforms, accepting Mr [X]’s position that there is no “market price” for the Preforms because those were tailor-made: para 237 of the award. (c) The tribunal considered and rejected the Buyer’s contention that the Seller’s damages for claim fails in total and its loss might well be zero because it had failed to prove the facts and the evidence necessary to establish its claim. The tribunal accepted the measure of damages advocated by the Seller, namely, the contract price of the Preforms under the Agreement less the market price of preforms (which the Seller described as the Hypothetical Market Price): para 230 of the award. (d) The tribunal noted that the Buyer disagreed with the Seller’s computation of the market price for preforms (at para 227 of the award), but the tribunal accepted the Seller’s computation of damages: paras 249 and 258(f) of the award – in particular, the tribunal accepted that the market price of preforms could be derived by a comparison with the trend of the market price of optical fiber: paras 230–251 of the award. Indeed, the Buyer itself acknowledged that there was a correlation between the price of optical fiber, and the price of preforms: it pleaded that because there was an “astronomical” drop in prices of optical fiber towards the end of 2018, the price of preforms reduced astronomically.48Foot Note 48×Defence, paras 68–73 (ABOD 189–191).It should have come as no surprise to the Buyer that if it were found to be in breach for non-acceptance of the Preforms for the relevant period, it would be ordered to pay substantial damages.",
        "The tribunal considered the Seller’s factual evidence as to whether there was in fact a market for the goods under the contract": "115 The Buyer argues that: (a) Its submissions and evidence were that there was a market for Preforms under the Agreement. (b) The Seller’s witness had conceded that there was a market for Preforms under the Agreement. (c) The tribunal noted but failed to act upon the Seller’s breach of Procedural Order No 4 (for the production of documents) (“PO 4”). (d) The Seller admitted that it had not manufactured any Preforms in the relevant period, and it is evident that the Seller made no efforts to sell Preforms to other customers, and yet the tribunal awarded damages based on a Hypothetical Market Price of preforms. (e) The tribunal found that it was the agreed position of the parties that there was an available market for preforms generally, yet proceeded on the basis that there was no available market for the Preforms under the Agreement. 116 Again, it appears from the award that these are all points which the tribunal had considered. Taking the five points above in turn: (a) The tribunal found that the Preforms under the Agreement were not generic: they were customised, specially designed for the Buyer, tailor-made, and there was no “market price” for them: paras 231, 237, and 258(b). (b) From Mr [X]’s evidence as reviewed by the tribunal at paras 237 and 253 of the award, Mr [X] had not conceded that there was a market for the Preforms under the Agreement. Instead, Mr [X]’s evidence was, in that period there were no enquiries from other buyers; the Seller’s customers could only purchase what they were already bound by contract to purchase, they were unable to purchase any more preforms and the Seller was unable to sell any additional volume; the supply made to the Seller’s customer in [Country A] was based on a long-term agreement. (c) The tribunal dealt with the PO 4 issue at paras 252–257 and 258(d) of the award. The tribunal noted that by PO 4, the Seller had been ordered to produce any communications between the Seller and its customers and prospective customers in relation to the Preforms which had not been accepted by the Buyer, if those communications existed. The tribunal further noted that the Seller did not produce any such communications. The tribunal commented that the Seller’s failure to produce communications in which it tried to find buyers for preforms during the relevant period means that it cannot prove the efforts that it took to find buyers, but that does not mean that its claim under s 50(3) of the SOGA failed or had to be reduced, for the principle of mitigation was already assumed within the measure of loss in s 50(3) of the SOGA. (d) At para 227, the Tribunal noted the Buyer’s contention about the Seller not having manufactured Preforms in the relevant period, and not producing evidence that it had offered preforms to its other customers. The Tribunal also noted Mr [X]’s evidence on these aspects: see sub-para (b) above. In the event, the Tribunal accepted the measure of damages advocated by the Seller, based on a Hypothetical Market Price. (e) At para 231, the Tribunal drew a distinction between preforms generally (for which the Tribunal found it common ground that there was an available market), and Preforms under the Agreement, for which the Tribunal did not find an available market. 117 The Buyer also criticises the tribunal for: (a) failing to consider all the relevant evidence that preform and optical fiber are neither alternatives nor close substitutes, and that optical fiber was not the most appropriate comparable product to preform; and (b) relying onAvra Commoditiesas the tribunal did. 118 On the former, the award however shows that: (a) The tribunal noted the Buyer’s submission that the optical fiber prices relied on by the Seller are not evidence of the market price of preforms for the relevant period (at para 235). (b) The tribunal noted Mr [X]’s evidence that a strong correlation exists between the market price of optical fiber and the market price of preform, which applies particularly in spot transactions (at para 238). (c) The tribunal noted Mr [Y]’s evidence agreeing with Mr [X] that there will be a positive correlation between the preform and optical fiber prices particularly in the long run, but that they were not perfectly correlated (at para 244). In the event, the tribunal accepted the Seller’s computation whilst noting that the correlation between optical fiber prices and preform prices is imperfect (but there was generally some correlation between them, as Mr [Y] himself accepted): at para 249. It was also the Buyer’s pleaded position that there was such a correlation: see [15] and [114(d)] above. 119 As for the tribunal’s reliance onAvra Commodities, the Buyer had in its rebuttal closing submissions49Foot Note 49×ABOD 947.at para 92 specifically addressed the Seller’s reliance on that case authority. The Buyer was not deprived of a right to be heard on that point, and there was no breach of natural justice; if the tribunal wrongly relied onAvra Commodities, that goes to the correctness of the award, it does not justify setting-aside.",
        "The tribunal considered the Buyer’s criticisms of the hypothetical market price, in particular that it dealt with data from [Country B], not [Country A]": "120 The Buyer complains about the tribunal using figures from [Country B] in determining the hypothetical market price, when the relevant market was [Country A]. 121 The Buyer acknowledges that it had made this point in submissions, and in its expert’s report (see paras 73–78 of the Buyer’s submissions for this application), and the tribunal had indicated that it understood the Buyer’s point: “I understand what you are saying about the market. I have heard what you say about how the claimant should not rely on the hypothetical spot market price in [Country B] in order to establish the market for [Country A]. So all that part I understood and I have heard you.”50Foot Note 50×ABOD 762. 122 The Buyer contends that the award, however, shows that the tribunal had failed to consider its contentions. In this regard, the tribunal stated at para 245 of the Award: In addition, it is [the Buyer’s] contention that the data used by Mr [X], i.e., prices of optical fiber as provided in the [business analysis] Reports, and which include the [Country B] market, as opposed to using the prices of … Preforms that [the Seller] sold to its other [Country A] customers during the period from February to December 2019, are inappropriate. I am not with [the Buyer] on this point because a reasonable reading of the [business analysis] Reports suggests that [Country A] is covered under the “developing world” region in the [business analysis] Reports. The [business analysis] Reports do not provide for a separate region for “Asia Pacific” which includes [Country A], as Counsel for [the Buyer] contended during the cross-examination of Mr [X]. 123 The award and the tribunal’s comments in the course of the hearing, do not show that the tribunal had failed to consider the Buyer’s contentions. On the contrary, they indicate that the tribunal had considered and rejected the Buyer’s contentions, to the extent of considering how the “[business analysis] Reports” should be read.",
        "Conclusion": "126 The Buyer has not established any of the grounds for setting-aside, and moreover has not suffered prejudice from the matters it complained of. I thus dismiss the setting-aside application. 127 I will hear the parties on costs. Andre ManiamJudge of the High Court Andre YeapSCand Devathas Satianathan (Rajah & Tann Singapore LLP) for the applicant; Tay Yong Seng, Ng Si Ming, Ang Ann Liang and Alyssa P’ng (Allen & Gledhill LLP) for the respondent."
