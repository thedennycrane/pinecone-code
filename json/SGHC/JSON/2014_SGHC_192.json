        "Background": "",
        "The TYC Group Structure": "10     The\nHour Glass Limited (“THG”) is a home-grown but well-known company\nthat grew from a family business into a company listed on the Singapore\nStock Exchange. It is a luxury watch retailer with some 30 watch outlets\nor boutiques across nine cities in the Asia Pacific region. 11     HT\nand JC are the founders of THG, and they are perhaps as well-known\nas THG. As husband and wife, they established THG in 1979 and have\nbeen responsible for the expansion of its business as described\nabove. Sadly, after 41 years of marriage, HT and JC were divorced\nin May 2010. 12     HT\nand JC also established TYC in 1979, as the family holding company\nof THG and other family assets. These assets are substantial in worth.\nAs at the financial year ended 31 March 2014, TYC held 108,288,397 ordinary\nshares representing approximately 46% of the issued share capital of\nTHG. TYC also owns two bungalows, at 40A Nassim Road and 40C Nassim\nRoad. The 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs each own a condominium unit\nin the prime Nassim Road location. 13     As\nmentioned earlier, HT and JC are the only two directors of TYC. In\nfact, pursuant to Art 8 of TYC’s articles of association (“the TYC Articles”),\nHT and JC are permanent “Governing Directors”. The ambit of Art\n8 is pivotal to the issues in the present case and the relevant\nportions of Art 8 are reproduced below: Subject to Article 3,the\nsaid Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew Lee shall be the permanent\nGoverning Directors of the Company until they resign from the office,\nthat is they will not whilst they hold such office be taken into account\nin determining the rotation of retirement of directors and the provision\nof Section 153 of the Companies Act will not apply to themand whilst they retain the said office, they will\nhave authority to exercise all the powers, authorities and discretion\nby these Articles expressed to be vested in the directors generallyincluding\nthe power to convene a general meeting of the Company, and of all\nthe other directors, if any, for the time being of the Company,\nshall be under their control and shall be bound to conform to their discretion\nin regard to the Company’s business. Subject to Article 3,the\nsaid Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew Lee whilst they hold the\noffice of Governing Directors, may from time to time, and at any\ntime, appoint any other persons to be directors of the Company, and\nmay define, limit and restrict their powers and may fix and determine their\nremuneration and duties and may at any time, remove any director howsoever\nappointed. Every such appointment or removal must be\nin writing under the hands of Dr Tay Yun Chwan and Mdm Chan Siew\nLee. Subject to Article 7, in the event of the\ndeath of any of the two Governing Directors, the surviving person\nshall be entitled to exercise all or any of the powers previously\nheld by the Governing Directors jointly. Subject as aforesaid and to these Articles,\nthe rights of all the shareholders shall be the same in every respect. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 14     In\nterms of shareholding, HT and JC each hold a founder share giving them\n46% and 44% of the voting rights in TYC respectively. Pursuant to\nArt 7 of the TYC Articles, all issued shares other than these two\nfounder shares are classified as ordinary shares, and no person\nother than HT or JC may hold these two founder shares. 15     The\nremaining ordinary shares in TYC are divided amongst HT and JC’s\nthree children. Of the three children, it is only necessary to highlight that\ntheir son, Michael, holds 5% of the voting rights in TYC. Michael’s\nrole will be evident in due course (see [42]–[45] below).",
        "Divorce Settlement Agreements": "16     The\nancillary matters in HT and JC’s divorce were settled amicably. As\npart of the divorce settlement, three agreements were entered into: (a)     a\nDeed of Settlement (“the DOS”) between HT and JC dated 9 April 2010.\nThe DOS settled the issues relating to the division of matrimonial\nassets and JC’s claim for maintenance; (b)     an\nAgreement for Amendment to the DOS and Settlement of Litigation\nbetween HT and JC dated 15 May 2012 (“the SSD”). The SSD involved\namendments to the DOS and matters pertaining to the management of\nTYC; and (c)     a\nDeed among HT, JC and TYC dated 11 June 2012 in respect of certain\nmatters relating to TYC as agreed in the DOS and the SSD (“the TYC\nDeed”). 17     In\nthe divorce settlement, the TYC Deed was the only agreement to which\nTYC was a party. I shall refer to all three agreements as the “Divorce Settlement\nAgreements”. 18     Although\ndivorced, HT and JC continued to be closely involved with TYC. They\nremained permanent “Governing Directors” of TYC, and the TYC group\ncontinued to hold a substantial part of the family assets. Accordingly,\nHT and JC sought to bind TYC by way of the TYC Deed, to matters\nrelating to TYC as earlier agreed between HT and JC in the DOS and\nthe SSD. 19     Under\ncl 15 of the SSD, the SSD would be “ineffective, null and void” if\nany of the four conditions below were not satisfied: (a)     TYC’s\nshareholders unanimously approve all the matters in the SSD relating\nto TYC; (b)     TYC\nenters into the TYC Deed; (c)     the\nTYC Articles are amended to give effect to the terms of the SSD;\nand (d)     HT\nand JC obtain an order of court approving the SSD if the above three\nconditions are satisfied. 20     It\nis not disputed that the above four conditions were satisfied. Central\nto the present dispute is cl 2 of the TYC Deed. Pursuant to cl 2,\nTYC became entitled to the benefit of the terms and conditions of,\nand became bound by the obligations in, the DOS and the SSD that\nrelate to TYC, as if it were a party to the SSD. 21     Article\n16 of the TYC Articles provides as follows: [TYC] may not amend, vary or waive any\nof its rights and/or obligations under or pursuant to the TYC Deed\nunless such amendment, variation or waiver has been unanimously\nconsented to by all the shareholders of [TYC]. 22     Article\n16 itself expressly provides that it can only be amended, varied or\nrepealed with the unanimous consent of all TYC shareholders. 23     In\nsummary, the TYC shareholders had unanimously agreed to the provisions\nof the SSD; TYC became bound by these provisions by virtue of the\nTYC Deed; and no provision of the SSD can be amended unless all\nTYC shareholders agree. The SSD is therefore indirectly entrenched\nas part of TYC’s constitution.",
        "Disputes relating to TYC": "",
        "JC’s refusal to approve payments": "24     Clause\n10 of the SSD (“the Payment Clause”) provides that payments to be\nmade by TYC require the approval of both HT and JC. The exact mechanism\nprovided in the Payment Clause reads: Payment voucher system for all future payments\nfor TYC. Neither HT nor JC will sign a cheque on TYC’s bank accounts\nunless the other has signed a voucher approving. 25     Because\ncheques could only be signed by either HT or JC if there is a corresponding\npayment voucher approved by the other, HT and JC were in a position\nwhereby each could, by either refusing to sign a payment voucher (or\na cheque for a signed payment voucher), prevent the other from causing TYC\nto make any payment. This arrangement was, perhaps with the full benefit\nof hindsight (following the breakup of the marriage), a recipe for disaster.\nTYC was bound by the Payment Clause because of the TYC Deed. 26     In\nJuly 2012, shortly after the TYC Deed was entered into, JC refused to\napprove certain payments by TYC. Initially, only two payments were\nin issue: (a)     fees\n(“the KPMG Fees”) payable to KPMG Services Pte Ltd (“KPMG”); and (b)     expenses\nincurred in relation to the properties at 40A Nassim Road and 40C\nNassim Road (“the Nassim Road Expenses”). 27     By\nthe time TYC had commenced this action in September 2013, JC had\nrefused to approve the payment of numerous other expenses. Two lists of\ncreditors were appended to the Originating Summons filed in this\naction. However, by the time I first heard OS 895, the dispute over\nthese expenses had been resolved, leaving only the KPMG Fees, the\nNassim Road Expenses, and the expenses incurred in connection with\nthe commencement of this action, which I will discuss at [28]–[36]\nand [49]–[50] below. The KPMG Fees 28     KPMG\nwere engaged by HT and JC in late 2012 to identify, and advise TYC\nand its shareholders on, accounting and tax issues arising from\nthe Divorce Settlement Agreements. The scope of KPMG’s work, contained\nin a service proposal, was approved by HT and JC. The fee quoted\nin the service proposal was $18,000. 29     Upon\nissuance of its final report in April 2013, KPMG submitted an invoice\nfor $19,424.05 to TYC (which included GST and disbursements). 30     A\npayment voucher for the KPMG Fees was then prepared on HT’s instructions\nand presented to JC for her approval and signature, as required by\nthe Payment Clause. JC refused to sign the voucher and payment could not\nbe made. Her view was that KPMG had not carried out its work properly\nbecause KPMG had not sought her input or comments in the preparation\nof their report. 31     HT,\non the other hand, had no issue with the work done by KPMG or the\nKPMG Fees. He gave three reasons why JC was wrong in refusing to pay.\nFirst, he argued that JC had agreed (and had signed in her personal capacity,\nand as a director of TYC) KPMG’s service proposal containing the scope\nof work, and letter of engagement. Second, there is no requirement for\nKPMG to meet with either HT or JC because any advice to be provided by\nKPMG will be based entirely on the contents of the DOS and the SSD. Finally,\nKPMG did in fact meet with JC to try and explain the contents of their\nreport to her. 32     HT\nasserted that “it [was] simply ridiculous” that JC refused to allow TYC\nto make payment despite KPMG providing its services in accordance with\nthe terms of engagement and making the effort to meet with JC. 33     The\nKMPG Fees were eventually paid by HT’s own company, Amstay Pte Ltd,\non 6 August 2013. Amstay Pte Ltd then sought reimbursement from\nTYC. The Nassim Road Expenses 34     Pursuant\nto cl 5(a) of Appendix B of the DOS, ownership of 40C Nassim Road\nwas transferred to TYC. Clause 5(a) expressly provides that TYC\nwould be responsible for all costs, taxes and outgoings on 40C Nassim Road\nafter such transfer. HT had sought reimbursement from TYC the sum of\n$299,880.56 which he claimed were expenses incurred in respect of\n40C Nassim Road for the period between late July 2011 and late July\n2013. 35     HT\nhad also sought reimbursement from TYC the sum of $60,988.02 which\nhe claimed were expenses incurred in respect of 40A Nassim Road. Pursuant\nto cl 16 of Appendix B of the DOS, ownership of 40A Nassim Road\nwould remain with TYC. Although (unlike cl 5(a) in the case of 40C Nassim\nRoad) the Divorce Settlement Agreements did not expressly provide\nthat TYC should pay for the costs, taxes and outgoings of 40A Nassim\nRoad, HT claimed that TYC should ordinarily be responsible for all such\nexpenses because TYC is the owner of the property. 36     JC,\nhowever, refused to approve the payment of HT’s reimbursement claims\nfor the Nassim Road Expenses. Why she refused to approve HT’s reimbursement\nclaims is now immaterial as this was resolved by way of a Consent\nOrder midway through these proceedings (see [62] below).",
        "The THG share redemption": "37     There\nwas a separate, but perhaps more significant (in monetary terms),\ndispute involving JC’s failure to procure the redemption of TYC’s shares\nin THG which were held by Overseas-Chinese Banking Corporation Limited\n(“OCBC”). JC had previously pledged up to approximately 22m THG\nshares held by TYC with OCBC in return for personal loans to her and\ncompanies under her control. 38     Under\ncl 11 of Appendix B of the DOS read with cl 8 of the SSD, she was\nsupposed to redeem those pledged THG shares by 9 April 2013. HT reminded\nJC through a series of letters from his solicitors from April 2013 to\nAugust 2013 that she was obliged under the DOS to fully redeem the pledged\nTHG shares by 9 April 2013. 39     However,\nas of 20 September 2013, there were still approximately 6.53m THG\npledged shares that had yet to be redeemed (“the Outstanding THG\nShares”). 40     The\nDOS contemplated the possibility that the THG pledged shares might\nnot be fully redeemed by 9 April 2013. Clause 11(d) of Appendix\nB of the DOS provides: In the event that [JC] fails to procure\nthe redemption and return of all of TYC’s approximately 22 million\nshares in THG… [by 9 April 2013]: (i)…….. (ii)TYCshall be entitled (A) to apply any dividend payments\ndue to be paid to [JC] towards redemption of its THG shares and/or (B) to immediately redeem its THG shareswhereupon\nthe redemption shall be a debt due from [JC] to TYC on demand and\nTYC may,inter alia, set off any\nfuture dividend payments due to be paid to [JC] against this debt. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 41     A\nself-help remedy was therefore available – TYC could itself utilise its\nown funds to redeem the Outstanding THG Shares, if JC failed to\ndo so by 9 April 2013. However, all payments by TYC required approval\nfrom both HT and JC, as per the Payment Clause (see [25] above).\nIn short, TYC could avail itself of the self-help remedy only if\nJC approved. According to HT, TYC was hamstrung because JC had consistently\nignored the issue of the Outstanding THG Shares; and JC had not,\ndespite the letters from HT’s solicitors, indicated how and when\nshe intended to procure redemption of the Outstanding THG Shares.",
        "The EGM": "42     HT\ncalled an extraordinary general meeting of TYC (“the EGM”) because\nof JC’s refusal to approve payment by TYC of various expenses and her\napparent indifference to fulfilling her obligation to redeem the Outstanding\nTHG Shares. 43     In\nHT’s words, the purpose of the EGM, which was held on 4 September\n2013, was to pass resolutions to “deal with JC’s obstructive conduct”\nwhich had created the “administrative deadlock”. 44     The\nother shareholders of TYC, being JC and the three children, were notified\nof the EGM by post. However, only HT and Michael turned up. A total\nof 18 resolutions were tabled and passed by HT and Michael who,\nas indicated in [15] above, collectively hold 51% of the voting\nrights in TYC. Only two shareholders are required under the TYC\nArticles to form a quorum. 45     Of\nthe 18 resolutions passed, the ones most relevant to the dispute\nare: (a)     Resolutions\n1(1), 1(2) and 3(6), approving that TYC, and HT, as director of\nTYC, take such steps and actions, including appointing solicitors\nto act for TYC and commencing court proceedings against JC, in connection\nwith procuring the redemption and return of the Outstanding THG\nShares; (b)     Resolutions\n4(1), 4(2), and 5(1), 5(2), approving the payment to HT of the Nassim\nRoad Expenses, and authorising HT to unilaterally sign the cheques\nand vouchers to effect the reimbursement; (c)     Resolutions\n4(3) and 5(3), authorising HT, as director of TYC, to take all steps\nand actions on TYC’s behalf as may be necessary or desirable in\nrelation to the payment of the Nassim Road Expenses; (d)     Resolutions\n6(1) and 6(2), approving the reimbursement to HT’s own company the\namount of the KPMG Fees (see [33] above), and authorising HT to\nunilaterally sign the cheques and vouchers to effect the reimbursement;\nand (e)     Resolution\n6(3), authorising HT, as director of TYC, to take all steps and\nactions on TYC’s behalf as may be necessary or desirable in relation\nto the payment of the KPMG Fees to HT’s own company.",
        "Appointment of TSMP": "46     On\n9 September 2013, HT appointed TSMP Law Corporation (“TSMP”) as\nsolicitors for TYC. In his affidavit, HT claimed that TSMP was appointed\nas solicitors for all four Plaintiffs but this is not borne out\nby the letter of engagement; the letter was signed by HT “for and\non behalf of TYC Investment Pte Ltd”. As it turned out (see [57]–[58]\nbelow), the issue of whether TSMP was acting for the 2nd, 3rd and\n4th Plaintiffs in OS 895 became immaterial. 47     HT\ninformed TYC’s other shareholders of TSMP’s appointment by email\non 11 September 2013. Through her then solicitors, JC informed HT and\nTSMP that she did not recognise TSMP as having any authority to\nact on behalf of TYC. In particular, JC argued that: (a)     the\nmanagement and administrative powers of TYC vest with its board\nof directors, and therefore, HT’s unilateral appointment of TSMP\nas TYC’s solicitors on the basis of “purported shareholders’ resolutions”\npassed in the EGM was “wholly improper”; and (b)     a\ndirector’s meeting, not a shareholders’ meeting, ought to have been\nconvened to decide on TSMP’s appointment. JC proposed that Mr Michael\nHwang, SC, be appointed as TYC’s solicitor. 48     HT\nrejected JC’s argument that the resolutions were improperly passed.\nThrough his own solicitors, Tan Rajah & Cheah, HT stated that\nJC had the requisite notice of the EGM. As for JC’s proposal to\nappoint Mr Michael Hwang, SC, HT simply replied that TSMP had already\nbeen appointed. TSMP, on behalf of TYC, also rejected JC’s argument\nthat TSMP’s appointment was improper. TSMP stated that the powers\nof management rest with shareholders when there is a deadlock in\nthe board. 49     Expenses\nwere incurred in connection with the EGM, and the appointment of\nTSMP. These included: (a)     legal\nfees payable to TSMP; and (b)     corporate\nsecretarial fees payable to Express Co Registration & Management\nLtd (“Express Co”). 50     JC\nrefused to approve payment by TYC for TSMP’s legal fees (“the TSMP\nFees”) because these arose from TSMP’s appointment by HT on behalf\nof TYC, and pursuant to the resolutions passed at the EGM. JC likewise\nrefused approval for Express Co’s corporate secretarial fees, which amounted\nto $321 (“the Express Co Fees”), because these were for expenses incurred\nfor the EGM, which she argued had not been validly convened.",
        "OS 895: The proceedings": "",
        "The reliefs sought by the Plaintiffs": "51     On\n24 September 2013, the Plaintiffs commenced OS 895 seeking two declarations: (a)     that\nthe cheques signed by HT on behalf of the Plaintiffs for payment\nto the Plaintiffs’ immediate and long-term recurring creditors (two\nlists of which were appended) and TSMP for legal services rendered\nto the Plaintiffs (for the TSMP Fees) are valid, binding and are\nto be honoured by the Plaintiffs’ banks (a list of which was appended),\nnotwithstanding that the cheques are not accompanied by a supporting\npayment voucher signed by JC; and (b)     that\nTYC’s cheques to be signed by HT for payment of all such amounts\nand to all such parties as necessary for TYC to procure the complete\nredemption, return and/or recovery of the Outstanding THG Shares\nare valid, binding and are to be honoured by TYC’s banks (a list\nof which was appended), notwithstanding that the cheques are not\naccompanied by a supporting payment voucher signed by JC. 52     Two\nfurther substantive prayers were added to OS 895 by way of orders\nmade in Summons 6201 of 2013 on 7 January 2014. They were: (a)     that\nJC specifically perform her contractual obligations under the DOS,\nthe SSD and the TYC Deed, in that she: (i)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques for expenses\nin relation to the Nassim Road Expenses; (ii)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that\nTYC can procure the complete redemption, return and/or recovery\nof the Outstanding THG Shares; (iii)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that\nTYC can make payment of the KPMG Fees, the Express Co Fees, and\nthe TSMP Fees to the relevant parties; and (iv)       sign all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that\nTYC can make payment of all expenses owing to TYC’s long-term recurring\ncreditors (a list of which was appended); and (b)     that\nJC specifically perform her contractual obligations under the DOS,\nthe SSD and the TYC Deed within seven days of a court order to that\neffect or within seven days of the presentation of the relevant\npayment voucher and/or cheque, failing which TYC’s cheques signed\nby HT for the relevant payments shall be valid, binding and are\nto be honoured by TYC’s banks, notwithstanding that the cheques\nare not accompanied by a supporting payment voucher signed by JC. 53     Although\nnot expressly stated, the two new prayers added to OS 895, in so\nfar as they also covered payments by TYC for the TSMP Fees and the Outstanding\nTHG Shares, were clearly alternative prayers to the first two declarations\noriginally sought in OS 895 (see [51(a)] and [51(b)] above). This\nis because specific performance would only be necessary if I dismissed TYC’s\nrequest that HT could unilaterally sign cheques to effect such payments.",
        "The hearings": "54     There\nwere three rounds of oral arguments before me. The Plaintiffs were\nrepresented by Mr Thio Shen-Yi, SC (“Mr Thio”). HT was represented by\nMr Chelva Rajah, SC. Mr Eugene Thuraisingam (“Mr Thuraisingam”) represented\nJC. 55     The\nfirst round of oral arguments took place on 24 Feb 2014. I made two\nobservations at this first hearing. First, I thought that it was\nrather clear, even on the basis of the affidavit evidence adduced\nthus far, that JC was in breach of her obligation to redeem the\nOutstanding THG Shares. Secondly, I pointed out to Mr Thio that\nthe affidavit evidence does not actually disclose that JC was not\nprepared toallow TYC to exercise the self-help remedy,\nand to itself redeemthe Outstanding THG Shares (as opposed\nto JC refusing to redeem these shares herself). I therefore adjourned\nthis hearing to give the Plaintiffs time to adduce evidence that\nJC was obstructing TYC from exercising its self-help remedy. 56     At\nthis first hearing, I also ordered that there be cross-examination\nof HT and JC on the issue of the KPMG Fees and the Nassim Road Expenses at\nthe next hearing because these items were the subject of factual\ndisputes raised in the affidavit evidence. 57     There\nwas an important clarification in the first hearing that I ought to\nmention. I queried Mr Thio on his role in relation to the 2nd, 3rd\nand 4th Plaintiffs respectively in the proceedings given that he\nwas, on his own case, formally appointed to represent TYC only.\nMr Thio clarified that as a result of events subsequent to the filing\nof OS 895, the 2nd, 3rd and 4th Plaintiffs no longer had any interest\nin the proceedings. I understood that to mean that there were no\npayment issues for which an order against JC was required by the\n2nd, 3rd or 4th Plaintiffs. 58     The\nnet effect of Mr Thio’s clarification was that the prayers sought\nin OS 895 now had to be narrowed down even further. References to\nthe Plaintiffs (see for example, [51(a)] above) would now be read\nas referring only to TYC. Indeed, for all intents and purposes,\nand notwithstanding six parties are formally named on the record,\nthe proceedings were really just between TYC and HT on the one side,\nand JC on the other. 59     The\nsecond hearing took place on 27 March 2014. At this hearing, Mr Thio\ninformed me that JC had indicated that she would comply with her obligation\nto procure full redemption of the Outstanding THG Shares by 15 April\n2014, failing which TYC could itself redeem the Outstanding THG Shares.\nHowever, Mr Thio sought an order from the court that JC procure OCBC\nto disclose the exact amount needed to redeem the Outstanding THG\nShares before 15 April 2014 – this order would enable TYC to effect redemption\nshould JC fail to do so by that date. 60     As\nagreed between Mr Thio and Mr Thuraisingam, I granted the following\nby way of a consent order (“Consent Order No 1”): (a)     JC\nshall procure OCBC to inform TYC on or before 10 April 2014 the\ncosts and expenses necessary for TYC to procure the complete redemption,\nreturn and/or recovery of the Outstanding THG Shares; and (b)     in\nthe event that JC fails to procure redemption of the Outstanding\nTHG Shares by 15 April 2014, she shall specifically perform her\ncontractual obligations under the DOS, the SSD and the TYC Deed\nby signing all necessary payment vouchers and/or cheques such that\nTYC can procure the complete redemption, return and/or recovery\nof the Outstanding THG Shares. 61     The\nhearing was then adjourned until after 15 April 2014. I would note\nhere that the most significant claim (in monetary terms) was disposed of\nwith Consent Order No 1. 62     The\nthird hearing took place on 21 April 2014. The main purpose of this\nhearing was to take oral evidence in relation to the Nassim Road Expenses\nand the KPMG Fees. However, before the cross-examination began,\nMr Thio informed me that all the parties had come to an agreement in\nrelation to the Nassim Road Expenses. JC would sign the relevant cheques\nor payment vouchers to enable TYC to reimburse HT. A draft consent\norder to that effect was then presented to be recorded as an Order of\nCourt (“Consent Order No 2”). I approved Consent Order No 2 in terms. 63     Therefore,\nat the cross-examination, the only outstanding issues that had yet\nto be resolved at that point were: (a)     the\nvalidity of the resolutions passed at the EGM authorising HT to\nappoint TSMP as TYC’s solicitors; (b)     flowing\nfrom that, which party was liable to pay the TSMP Fees and the Express\nCo Fees; and (c)     payment\nof the KPMG Fees. 64     At\nthe end of this third hearing, I asked counsel for all parties to provide\nfurther submissions on the above issues.",
        "My decision": "",
        "The validity of the resolutions\npassed at the EGM": "The EGM’s power to appoint solicitors\nto commence legal action 65     The\ncase before me was argued on the footing that the validity of TSMP’s\nappointment, and therefore, TYC’s liability to pay the TSMP Fees, would\ndepend on whether the EGM had the power to authorise HT to appoint\nsolicitors to commence the present proceedings. 66     It\nwould seem intuitively logical, and practically sensible, that shareholders\nwith majority control over a company should be able to authorise\nthe commencement of legal proceedings against an errant director,\nif the board of directors of that company cannot act by virtue of that\ndirector having the ability to veto any board resolution authorising such\nproceedings. However, as will become evident, the simplicity of\nthis proposition is more apparent than real. 67     A\nconvenient starting point is the rule inFoss\nv Harbottle(1843) 2 Hare 461 (“Foss\nv Harbottle”). The rule states that the proper plaintiff\nin a suit for the enforcement of a corporate right is the company\nitself. Therefore, minority shareholders are generally not entitled\nto sue to enforce a company’s rights. This aspect of the rule inFoss v Harbottleis clear. 68     The\nmore contentious question relates to which organ of the company\n(that is, the board of directors or the members in general meeting),\nconstitutes the “company” for the purpose of commencing litigation\nin the company’s name. 69     Interestingly,Foss v Harbottlesuggests that the power\nto commence litigation lies with the members in general meeting\nwhere the action is brought against errant directors to enforce\nduties owed to the company. The court there noted (at 493): On the first point it is only necessary\nto refer to the clauses of the Act to shew that, whilstthe supreme governing body, theproprietors at a special general meetingassembled,\nretain the power of exercising the functions conferred upon them\nby the Act of Incorporation,it cannot be\ncompetent to individual corporators to suein the manner\nproposed by the Plaintiffs on the present record. [emphasis added\nin bold italics] 70     However,Foss v Harbottlewas decided at a time\nwhere a company was regarded as an association of its shareholders.\nIn other words, the shareholders in general meeting were equated\nwith the company. Directors, on the other hand, were regarded as\nagents of the members in general meeting and therefore, subject\nto shareholders’ control: see Pearlie Koh,Company\nLaw(LexisNexis, 2nd Ed, 2009) (“Company\nLaw”) at p 71; and R P Austin and I M Ramsay,Ford’s Principles of Corporations Law(LexisNexis,\n15th Ed, 2013) (“Ford”) at p 232–233. 71     This\nparadigm was substantially altered by the seminal decision of the House\nof Lords inSaloman v A Saloman & Co Ltd[1897]\nAC 22 (“Saloman”) which recognised\nthat a company was a separate legal entity from its members, and\nsubsequently byAutomatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate\nCo Ltd v Cunninghame[1906] 2 Ch 34 (“Cunninghame”).Cunninghamerejected the notion that directors\nwere agents of the members in general meeting. Instead, the House\nof Lords held that directors owed their duties to the company as\na separate entity (seeCompany Lawat\npp 71–2; andFordat pp 233–234). 72     Importantly,\nfor present purposes,Cunninghameestablished\nthat the division of powers between the directors and shareholders\nin any case would depend on the construction of a company’s constitution,\nwhich has the effect of a contract between the members and the company,\nand the members among themselves. 73     In\nSingapore, the division of powers between directors and shareholders\nis also statutorily enshrined in s 157A of the Companies Act which\nprovides: Powers\nof directors 157A.—(1)The\nbusiness of a companyshallbe managed by or under the direction of the directors. (2)    The\ndirectors may exercise all the powers of a company except any power\nthat this Act or the memorandum and articles of the company require the\ncompany to exercise in general meeting. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 74     Companies\nwhich adopt the Table A articles of association (“Table A Articles”)\ncontained in the Fourth Schedule to the Companies Act will have Art\n73, which is identical to s 157A(1) and (2). Article 73 was incorporated as\npart of TYC’s Articles. 75     In\nthis regard, s 157A is best understood in the light of its legislative history.\nPrior to its enactment in 2003, there was no statutory statement\nas to the distribution of powers between the board of directors\nand the general meeting. Rather, this was determined solely by a\ncompany’s constitution. 76     For\ncompanies that had adopted the Table A Articles under the Fourth\nSchedule to theoldCompanies Act\n(Cap 50, 1967 Rev Ed), the Art 73 then in force (“the old Art 73”)\nprovided as follows: The business of the\ncompany shall be managed by the directorswho may pay all\nexpenses incurred in promoting and registering the company, and\nmay exercise all such powers of the company as are not, by the Act\nor by these Regulations, required to be exercised by the company\nin general meeting,subject, nevertheless, to any of these Regulations, to the provisions\nof the Act,and to such regulations,\nbeing not inconsistent with the aforesaid Regulations or provisions,\nas may be prescribed by the company in general meeting;\nbut no regulation made by the company in general meeting shall invalidate\nany prior act of the directors which would have been valid if that regulation\nhad not been made. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] It should be noted that the old Art 73 is inparimateriawith reg 55 of Table A under the\nCompanies Act 1862 (UK). 77     The\ncases have not spoken in a single voice as to the meaning of the limiting\nwords in the old Art 73 (which are in bold italics in the extract above). 78     There\nare basically two lines of authority. 79     The\nfirst states that the old Art 73 vests management powers exclusively\nin the board of directors and the members in general meeting cannot\noverride board decisions or direct the board to act in a certain\nway: seeCunninghame;Quin & Axtens Ltd v Salmon[1909]\nAC 442;John Shaw & Sons (Salford) Ltd\nv Peter Shaw and John Shaw[1935] 2 KB 112 (“John Shaw”); andBreckland\nGroup Holdings v London and Suffolk Properties Ltd[1989]\nBCLC 100. 80     Under\nthe first line of authority, the shareholders’ control over the exercise\nof management powers by the directors is limited to two options: amending\nthe articles, or removing the board and electing a new one in its place.\nThe shareholders cannot usurp the powers which are vested in the directors\nby the company’s articles:John Shawat\n134. 81     The\nsecond line of authority states that the members in general meeting\ncan control the board of directors by passing an ordinary resolution,\nprovided the resolution is not inconsistent with the Companies Act\nor the articles of the company: see for exampleMarshall’s\nValve Gear Co Ltd v Manning Wardle & Co Ltd[1909]\n1 Ch 267; andCredit Development Pte Ltdv IMO Pte Ltd[1993] 1 SLR(R) 68 (“Credit Development”). 82     InCredit Development, the issue was whether\nthe shareholders had the power to pass resolutions to appoint accountants\nand solicitors to investigate the affairs of the company (in this\ncase, the company’s articles contained a provision that was identical\nto the old Art 73). Lim Tiong Qwee JC held that this was a matter\nof interpreting the company’s articles. On this basis he found that\nthe shareholders did have such a power. He observed (at [22]): When such resolutions are passed, what\nthe company in general meeting is saying to the directors is “Appoint\naccountants and solicitors for these specific purposes.Subject to thatyou\nmanage the company’s business and exercise all the company’s powers”.[emphasis\nadded in italics and bold italics] 83     In\nDecember 1999, the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework\nCommittee (“the CLRFC”), chaired by Dr Phillip Pillai, was appointed\nand tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of the company\nlaw and regulatory framework in Singapore. The CLRFC’s findings\nand recommendations were published in theReport\nof the Company Legislation and Regulatory Framework Committee(October 2002)(“theCLRFC Report”). 84     The\nCLRFC recommended that the Companies Act then in force be amended\nto include a statutory restatement of the division of powers between\nthe directors and the general meeting along the lines of s 198A\nof the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (No 50 of 2001) (Aust) (“the Australian\nCorporations Act”). The CLRFC’s recommendation was as follows (see\ntheCLRFC Reportat para 4.7): 4.7.1We recommend\nthe adoption of the statutory restatement of the distribution of\npowers between directors and general meeting in the following model\nused in s. 198A of the Australian Corporations Act 2001: “(1) The business\nof a company is to be managed by or under the direction of the directors.\n(2) The directors may exercise all the powers of the company except any\npowers that this Act or the company’s constitution (if any) requires\nthe company to exercise in general meeting.”This will override article 73 of Table A, Fourth\nSchedule, CA which provides that management powers are also subject\nto “such regulations, being not inconsistent with the aforesaid Regulations\nor provisions, as may be prescribed by the company in general meeting.” 4.7.2 In the Singapore decision ofCredit Development v IMO[1993] 2 SLR 370,\non a construction of article 73 of Table A, Fourth Schedule, CA,\nit was held that an ordinary resolution of shareholders in a general\nmeeting may exercise some of the powers given to the directors.\nThe holding in Credit Development takes a different approach from\nUK and Australian cases (now clearly backed by the slightly different\narticles they have and also provisions like s. 198A, Australian\nCorporations Act 2001) which give management more autonomy. While\nthe decision inCredit Developmentis\nuseful in those exceptional cases where the majority shareholder\ndoes not control the board, it may not be necessary with the re-statement\nof directors’ duties that has been recommended, and in particular,\nthe re-emphasis on the duty of directors to exercise their powers\nfor proper purposes. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 85     Section\n157A was introduced by way of the Companies (Amendment) Act (Act\n8 of 2003) because of the CLRFC’s recommendation. In my view, this\nprovision, as well as Art 73 (where adopted), settles the position\nthat where powers of management are vested in the board of directors,\nthenordinarily, the board alone\ncan exercise those powers. The shareholders cannot control the board\nin the exercise of these powers by passing a resolution. 86     There\nis a further (open) question as to whether it was also Parliament’s\nintention thatonlythe board of\ndirectors should ever make management decisions: seeCompany Lawat p 74. To put this differently, should\nan express term in a company’s articles conferring management powers\nupon the shareholders be deemed invalid as a matter of law? Or does\ns 157A establish a default rule which may be varied by the company’s articles? 87     Although\nthis issue did not arise in the present case and parties did not\nmake submissions on it, I would parenthetically observe that the\nlatter interpretation is preferable because: (a)     as\na matter of practicality and commercial reality, corporate structures\nare so varied that it would be impossible to prescribe a set form\nof corporate governance. For example, there may be good commercial\njustifications for certain management powers to be reserved to the\nmembers in the case of a closely held joint venture company; (b)     under\ns 157A(2), the directors may exercise all the powers of the company,\napart from what the Companies Act or the company’s constitution\nreserves for the general meeting; (c)     section\n198A of the Australian Corporations Act, upon which s 157A is based,\nis modelled as a “replaceable rule” and therefore can be overridden\nby express provision in a company’s constitution; (d)     the\nfact that the language of s 157A is replicated in Art 73 of the Table\nA Articles suggests that a company may choose to depart from the\nstatutorily prescribed division of powers in its constitution; (e)     there\nis nothing in the relevant secondary material which suggests that\nParliament had intended s 157A to have the effect of invalidating\nany attempt to depart from the division of powers under s 157A; (f)     conversely,\nit would appear that s 157A was intended to prevent shareholders\nfrom interfering with the exercise of management powers where these\nare vested in the board of directors by the constitution; and (g)     the\nleading textbook on company law in Singapore supports the view that\ns 157A establishes a default rule which may be varied by the company’s\narticles: seeWalter Woon on Company Law(Tan\nCheng Han gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell, Revised 3rd Ed, 2009) (“Walter Woon”) at p 150. 88     It\nis therefore my view that the division of powers between the board of\ndirectors and the shareholders is amatter\nof contractunder current Singapore law, subject to any\nprovision in the Companies Act. 89     The\nconstitution of the company is therefore paramount, and it is not possible\nto generalise in any given case. If, however, s 157A and Art 73\nof the Table A Articles apply, as they did in the present case,\nthen the compact between the shareholders and the directors is that\nwhile the former own the company, the latter manage it. 90     The\nreason for this compact may be somewhat obvious – directors are fiduciaries\nof the company whereas shareholders are not. Directors are therefore\nrequired, always, to act in the best interests of the company. Shareholders\nare not fiduciaries of the company – shareholders are entitled to\nvote in their own personal interests on any shareholders’ resolution.\nThis is so even if their personal interests conflict with the company’s\nbest interests. 91     Mr\nThio was therefore correct in conceding that ordinarily, the board of\nTYC alone may exercise powers of management because TYC’s constitution\nvested such powers in the board. Mr Thio submitted, however, that\nTYC’s board was deadlocked in relation to the numerous issues raised at\nthe EGM. In that case, he said that there was an exception to the\ngeneral rule that shareholders could not exercise management powers.\nHe argued that a general meeting had “reserve powers” of management,\nwhich, in this case, included the power to appoint solicitors to\ncommence OS 895. 92     Mr\nThuraisingam accepted that the TYC board was deadlocked in relation\nto the issues raised at the EGM. He also accepted that the shareholders\ndid have some form of reserve powers if TYC’s board was unable or\nunwilling to act. He argued, however, that this was limited to appointing\nnew directors and that reserve powers did not give the shareholders\npowers of management. According to Mr Thuraisingam, this meant that\nthe EGM did not have the power to appoint solicitors to commence\nOS 895. 93     Both\nparties cited several authorities where the courts had considered both\nthe existence and scope of the general meeting’s reserve powers.\nI will now consider the most relevant of these authorities, starting\nwith three English cases. 94     InBarron v Potter[1914] Ch 895 (“Barron”), the company’s constitution gave\nthe directors the power to appoint additional directors. There were\nonly two directors. One of the directors refused to attend meetings\nand the business of the company came to a standstill. An extraordinary\ngeneral meeting of the company was convened and resolutions passed\nto remove the recalcitrant director and to appoint new directors. 95     The\nissue then was whether the appointment of the new directors was valid.\nIn holding that it was, Warrington J stated (at 903): If directors having\ncertain powers are unable or unwilling to exercise them – are in\nfact a non-existent body for the purpose– there must\nbe some power in the company to do itself that which under other\ncircumstances be otherwise done. The directors in the present case\nbeing unwilling to appoint additional directors under the power\nconferred on them by the articles, in my opinion, the company in\ngeneral meeting has power to make the appointment. [emphasis added] 96     InFoster v Foster[1916] 1 Ch 532 (“Foster”), the articles gave the directors\nthe power to appoint one of their own as managing director. In circumstances\nwhere the directors were unable to appoint a managing director because\nof internal friction, the court held that the general meeting had\nthe power to do so. 97     InAlexander Ward & Co v Samyang Co[1975]\n1 WLR 673(“Alexander Ward”), two\nmembers of the company instituted proceedings on the company’s behalf.\nAt the time the proceedings were commenced, the company had no directors.\nThe company later went into liquidation and the liquidator ratified\nthe proceedings. Before the House of Lords, it was argued that the\nliquidator could not ratify the proceedings because there was no\ncompetent principal at the time the proceedings were commenced. The\nHouse of Lords rejected this argument. Lord Hailsham stated (at 678–679): [A]t the relevant time the company was\nfully competent either to lay arrestments or to raise proceedings\nin the Scottish courts.The company could have\ndone so either by appointing directors, or, as I think,by authorising proceedings in general meeting, which\nin the absence of an effective board, has a residual authority to\nuse the company’s power. [emphasis added] 98     More\nrecently, the New South Wales Court of Appeal inMassey\n& Anor v Wales & Ors[2003] NSWCA 212 (“Massey”) considered the question of shareholder\nreserve powers.Masseyconcerned\na company which had two directors. One director, Yaqob Rajwan, wanted\nto appoint Baruch Rajwan to the board of the company but a quorum\nfor a board meeting could not be reached as the board was deadlocked.\nYaqob Rajwan nonetheless held a board meeting in the absence of\nthe other director and Baruch Rajwan was appointed as a director.\nThis appointment was invalid. The Rajwans then gave instructions\nto solicitors to commence legal proceedings on the company’s behalf.\nThereafter, a shareholders resolution was passed to ratify the appointment\nof the solicitors. The issue before the court therefore was whether\nthe shareholders had the power to do so. 99     Hogdson\nJA (with whom Meagher and Beazley JJA agreed) held that on the facts\nof the case, the general meeting did not have the power to ratify the\nappointment of solicitors. His reasons were as follows: (a)     If\nthe articles provide that the business of the company is to be managed\nby the directors, there is generally no power in the general meeting\nto control or direct the directors in the exercise of these powers:Masseyat [45]. (b)     This\nis because of the contract between the members as contained in the\nconstitution of the company. Under this contract, the management\nof the company should be by persons who each should have a fiduciary\nduty to act in the interest of the company as a whole:Masseyat [46]. (c)     The\ngeneral position is subject to the qualification that where the\nboard is unwilling or unable to act, the general meeting has some kind\nof reserve power. The source of this reserve power is a matter of implication\non the basis of business efficacy or necessity:Masseyat [47]. (d)     Where,\nas in the present case, the articles contained an express power\nfor the general meeting to appoint new directors or to remove directors\nand replace them with other directors, it would be unreasonable\nto regard a deadlock in the board as giving shareholders general\npowers of management:Masseyat\n[47]. (e)     The\nearlier cases, includingBarronandFoster, did not support a wide doctrine\nof reserve powers:Masseyat [50]–[71]. (f)     Insofar\nasAlexander Wardstood for the\ncontrary proposition, it should not be followed:Masseyat\n[59]. 100    I\npause here to note that the juridical basis of the general meeting’s reserve\npowers is not clear. 101    InWalter Woon, the position is stated broadly,\nand as follows (at para 5.13): If there is no competent board or where\nthe board cannot act (e.g. where there is a deadlock in the board),\nthe power of management reverts to the members. Walter WooncitesBarronas authority for this proposition.\nLord Hailsham’sdictainAlexander Ward(see [97] above) also supports\nthis broad proposition. 102    The\nobvious difficulty with a wide doctrine of reserve powers is that\nit is not readily reconcilable with the division of powers between\nthe directors and shareholders under s 157A of the Companies Act\n(and Art 73 of the Table A Articles): seeCompany\nLawat p 76; Paul Davies and Sarah Worthington,Gower & Davies Principles of Modern Company Law(Sweet &\nMaxwell,9th Ed, 2012) (“Gower\n& Davies”) at p 391. 103    In\nfact, one prominent academic has gone as far as to suggest that reserve\npowers canneverexist under the\nmodern view of the division of powers between directors and shareholders:\nsee Ross Grantham, “The reserve powers of company shareholders”\n(2004) 63(1) CLJ 36 at p 37. Professor Grantham suggests that the\nexistence of reserve powers rests on the (outdated) notion that\ndirectors are agents of the shareholders in general meeting. 104    Another\nview is that reserve powers are a matter of implication under a\ncompany’s constitution on the basis of necessity or business efficacy:\nsee for exampleFord’s Principles of Corporations\nLawvol 1 (Butterworths, Loose-Leaf Service, 1995) at\npara 7.130.6. As noted earlier,Masseyaccepted this\nas the basis for the qualification to the general rule that powers\nof management reside in the board alone. In my view, this analysis\nis persuasive. 105    As\na matter of principle, the predicate of the compact between the shareholders\nand the company under s 157A of the Companies Act (and Art 73 of\nthe Table A Articles) is the subsistence of a board of directors\nthat is both competent and willing to manage the affairs of the\ncompany. If this predicate is absent or otherwise incapable of fulfilling\nits purpose, it does not make sense that the company should be powerless\nto act simply because of the general rule that powers of management\nare ordinarily exercisable by the directors alone. 106    Further,\nthe rationale for implying reserve powers is most evident from the\nviewpoint of policy. Professor Grantham himself concedes that if legal\nproceedings are contemplated against a director who is able to prevent the\ncompany from suing, it would be undesirable on the ground of accountability\nif the shareholders were powerless to act. However, Professor Grantham’s\nobjection to shareholder reserve powers is that they cannot be explained\nin a principled way. Based on what I have said at [104] and [105] above,\nI would respectfully disagree. 107    Yet,\nit must be emphasised that insofar as shareholder reserve powers are\na matter of implication, their scope is narrow and the express terms\nof the contract between the shareholders and directors should be\nrespected as far as possible. In this regard, I agree with Hodgson\nJA’s view inMasseythat there is\nno wide doctrine of reserve powers. A wide doctrine of reserve powers\ncan only rest on the proposition that the board is generally subject to\nthe control and direction of the shareholders. As I have already\nnoted, this would be untenable in view of s 157A (and Art 73 of\nthe Table A Articles). 108    In\nmy judgment, the cases on reserve powers can be distilled into the following\nset of principles: (a)     Reserve\npowers do not devolve to the shareholders unless the board is unable\nor unwilling to act. (i)       In relation to unwillingness, the fact that shareholders disagree\nwith abona fideboard decision\nwill not in itself be sufficient. (ii)       However, if the directors who are preventing the company from\nsuing are the wrongdoers themselves, this requirement is more often\nthan not satisfied. (b)     If\nthe deadlock in management may be broken in some other way under\nthe company’s constitution (as was the case inMassey), then\nthe court should refuse to recognise that shareholders have reserve\npowers of management. (i)       The reason for this proposition is that reserve powers are implied\nunder a company’s constitution on the basis of necessity. The corollary\nto this proposition is that mere convenience will not justify the\nexercise of management powers by shareholders. (ii)       In this regard, I note that inMassey,\nthe deadlock in management could have, as a matter of contract,\nbeen broken by appointing additional directors. (c)     The\nscope of the reserve powers which the shareholders may exercise\nwould depend on the facts of each case. (i)       The cases have not established any general proposition governing\nthe issue of scope. In my view, it is clear that reserve powers\nmay not be exercised to contravene an express term in a company’s\narticles. (ii)       A convenient test, in my view, can be stated as what is reasonably\nnecessary in the circumstances of the case. The reference to necessity\nrecognises that reserve powers arise because of a deadlock in management\nand hence their scope should ordinarily go no further than what\nis necessary to break that deadlock. It reinforces the point that\nreserve powers are narrow in scope. (iii)       The reference to reasonableness, on the\nother hand, recognises the practical difficulties and uncertainties\nwhich shareholders face in the purported exercise of reserve powers. Necessity\nmust therefore be judged with a degree of latitude. (d)     Keeping\nin mind that it is all a matter of contract, the resolution in general\nmeeting to commence proceedings must be passed in accordance with\nthe requisite majority as prescribed by the company’s constitution.\nAbsent any super majority requirement contained in the company’s\nconstitution, the power to commence proceedings may be authorised\nby an ordinary resolution. 109    I\nwill now apply these principles to the case before me. 110    In\nrelation to the first issue of whether TYC’s board was unable or unwilling\nto act, it is not disputed by the parties that TYC’s board was deadlocked\nin relation to the matters raised at the EGM. 111    The\nsource of the deadlock was twofold. First, the Payment Clause required\nboth HT and JC to approve payments by TYC (see [25] above) and JC\nhad refused to approve payment of many expenses (at the commencement\nof OS 895, these expenses were not limited to the KPMG Expenses\nand the Nassim Road Expenses (see [27] and [51] above), including\nthe amounts required to redeem the Outstanding THG Shares. Second,\nHT and JT were the only two directors of TYC, and both had to agree\nwhen making management (and payment) decisions. 112    In\nrelation to the second issue of whether the deadlock in management\ncould be broken in some other way under TYC’s Articles, there were\narguments before me as to whether TYC’s Articles even allowed for\nadditional directors to be appointed. In my view, however, these arguments\nhad no bearing for two reasons. 113    The\nfirst relates to a point alluded to earlier, that is, the source\nof the deadlock in the present case was the Payment Clause, which\nrequired both HT and JC to approve payments by TYC. The appointment\nof additional directors would not have broken the deadlock in this\nrespect. 114    The\nsecond relates to the fact that the parties did not dispute that\nArt 8 of TYC’s Articles (see [13] above) meant that any additional\ndirectors appointed would have been bound by HT’s or JC’s discretion\nin respect of the management of TYC. This included the commencement\nof OS 895. 115    I\nwas therefore satisfied that TYC did not have a contractual remedy under\nthe TYC Articles to break the deadlock in relation to the matters raised\nat the EGM. 116    In\nrelation to the third issue of scope, Mr Thuraisingam submitted that\nthe reserve powers of the EGM were limited to appointing new directors.\nHe submitted that the doctrine of reserve powers did not permit shareholders\nto exercise management powers, including the power to appoint solicitors\nto commence proceedings. Mr Thuraisingam citedMasseyas\nauthority for this proposition. 117    I\nwas unable to agree with Mr Thuraisingam’s submission. For a start, it\nconflates the second and third issues identified at [108(b)] and\n[108(c)] above. InMassey, Hodgson\nJA found thatnoreserve powers\ndevolved to the shareholders because the deadlock in management\ncould be broken by appointing additional directors. Hodgson JA therefore\ndid not go on to consider the issue of scope as it was moot. Hence,Masseydoes not stand for the proposition\nthat shareholders’ reserve powers are limited to appointing additional\ndirectors. 118    Keeping\nwith the discussion at [108(c)] above, I was of the view that the\nscope of shareholder reserve powers are fact-sensitive issues. In\nthis regard, I agreed with Mr Thio’s submission thatMasseycould be distinguished because\nthe appointment of additional directors would not have broken the\ndeadlock in the present case (see [112]–[115] above). 119    Mr\nThuraisingam further submitted that it would be contrary to Art 76\nof TYC’s Articles for the EGM to exercise the power to appoint solicitors to\ncommence proceedings. The exact wording of Art 76 is as follows: The directors may from time to time by\npower of attorney appoint any corporation, firm, limited liability\npartnership or person or body of persons, whether nominated directly\nor indirectly by the directors, to be the attorney or attorneys\nof the company for such purposes and with such powers, authorities,\nand discretion (not exceeding those vested in or exercisable by the\ndirectors under these Regulations) and for such period and subject\nto such conditions as they may think fit, and any such powers of\nattorney may contain such provisions for the protection and convenience\nof persons dealing with any such attorney as the directors may think\nfit and may also authorise any such attorney to delegate all or\nany of the powers, authorities and discretions vested in him. 120    With\nrespect, I disagreed with Mr Thuraisingam’s argument. “Attorneys”\nmay mean lawyers under American usage but that was not its meaning\nunder Art 76. In my view, Art 76 relates to the appointment of delegates\nunder a power of attorney and not to the appointment of solicitors\nto commence proceedings. 121    Finally,\nand in relation to the requirement in [108(d)] above, I noted that\nTYC’s Articles do not prescribe any super majority requirement for\na general meeting to authorise legal proceedings. I was therefore\nsatisfied that the ordinary resolution passed at the EGM constituted\nvalid approval for the commencement of OS 895 against JC. 122    On\nthe facts of this case, I was satisfied that it was reasonably necessary\nfor the EGM to have the limited power to appoint solicitors to commence\nproceedings to determine the rights and obligations of the relevant\nparties under the Divorce Settlement Agreements, so as to break the\ndeadlock in management. 123    In\ncoming to this conclusion, I was mindful of the nature of the litigation\ndecision in the present case; the proceedings were commenced against\na director who herself could prevent the company from suing. In circumstances\nwhere the board itself was incapable of making a disinterested decision,\nI was fortified in my view that it was reasonable for the EGM to\nexercise the power to do so. Section 216A of the Companies Act 124    I\nwill now consider whether (and if so how) s 216A of the Companies Act\naffects the issue of whether the EGM had the power to appoint solicitors\nto commence OS 895 and therefore, my decision that the EGM did have\nsuch power. Section 216A permits a “complainant” to commence action\nin the name of a company, subject to satisfying certain requirements. Section\n216A(1) defines a “complainant” and for present purposes, it suffices\nto say that the definition includes a shareholder of a company. 125    The\nparties did not address the s 216A issue squarely in submissions. Mr\nThuraisingam submitted that if JC had breached her fiduciary duties, HT\nought to have commenced a derivative action against her for damages under\ns 216A. However, Mr Thuraisingam’s argument seemed to be directed\nat whether the prayers for specific performance as a remedy should be\ngranted and not the EGM’s power to commence proceedings against\nJC. 126    Mr\nThio, on the other hand, merely argued that HT did not need to commence\na derivative action under s 216A because he had the support of the\nmajority at the EGM. 127    InMassey, Hodgson JA appeared to suggest\nthat the general meeting lacked the power to commence legal proceedings\nbecause individual shareholders could commence derivative proceedings\nin the company’s name in some cases. Hodgson JA stated (at [70]): … I would have thought that the inability\nof a general meeting to authorise the commencement of proceedings\nis a reason why, in some circumstances, an individual shareholder\nshould be permitted to do so. 128    It\nis not clear precisely what Hodgson JA meant. If he was suggesting that\na general meeting does not havewidepowers\nto commence proceedings in the company’s name when powers of management\nare vested in the board, this view would be uncontroversial. If,\nhowever, Hodgson JA was stating a broader proposition that the general\nmeeting could never possess reserve powers to commence legal proceedings,\nthen I must respectfully disagree. 129    I\ndo not doubt that it would be more conducive to certainty in cases such\nas the present if a derivative action is commenced. It may also\nbe argued that if the general meeting is permitted to exercise reserve\npowers (in appropriate cases) to commence legal proceedings in the\ncompany’s name, then the requirements (and safeguards) prescribed\nby s 216A would be circumvented. There are three requirements. The\ncomplainant must: (a)     give\n14 days’ notice to the board of his intention to apply for leave\nto commence a derivative action; (b)     be\nacting in good faith; and (c)     show\nthat it isprima faciein the interest\nof the company that the action be brought. 130    In\nmy judgment, such an argument, although attractive at first blush, was\nuntenable on the facts of the present case for the following reasons. 131    To\nbegin with, s 216A is a facilitative provision and it clearly does\nnot mandate that a derivative action is commenced in every case\nwhere proceedings are authorised by shareholders as opposed to the\nboard. A clear example in which a derivative action need not be\ncommenced is where the power to commence litigation is expressly\nconferred on the general meeting by the company’s articles. 132    It\nshould be noted that there are important conceptual differences between\na derivative action and an action brought by the general meeting\nin the exercise of its reserve powers. 133    At\ncommon law, a derivative action is one where a member sues in his own\nname, on behalf of all the other members, to enforce the company’s rights.\nIn this sense, he “derives” his right to sue from the company:Walter Woonat para 9.30. The position\nunder s 216A is somewhat different. Strictly speaking, an action\nbrought under that section is a corporate (as opposed to a personal)\naction brought in the company’s name:Walter Woonat\npara 9.69. In substance however, the action is controlled by the individual\ncomplainant and not the board of directors. To this extent, a derivative\naction is a “true” exception to the proper plaintiff rule inFoss v Harbottle. 134    In\ncontrast, reserve powers are a matter of implication under a company’s\nconstitution and they relate to the internal division of power between\nthe two organs of the company. If it is shown that the general meeting\ndid have reserve powers to commence proceedings, then the proper\nplaintiff would be before the court and it would be moot to consider whether\nan exception to the rule in the sense of a derivative action should apply. 135    In\nthis regard, the following observations inCompany\nLaw(at pp 142–143) are instructive: The rule inFoss v\nHarbottleis of course not so much concerned about the question\nof how corporate powers are divided between the organs of the company,\nbut is concerned with the question whether individual shareholders\nmay commence suit [sic] on behalf of the company. 136    I\nagree. It would be putting the cart before the horse to regard the ability\nto bring a derivative action as foreclosing the possibility of the general\nmeeting exercising reserve powers to commence legal proceedings in\nthe company’s name. 137    I\nalso noted that the requirements under s 216A are generally directed at\nproceedings commenced by minority shareholders and not by the majority\nin general meeting. At the second reading of the Companies (Amendment)\nBill 1993, it was stated by the then Minister of Finance, Dr Richard\nHu Tsu Tau that: As Members would recall, the proposed new\nsections 216A and 216B provide for statutory derivative actions\nby minority shareholders on behalf of their companies. Only one\nrepresentor has questioned the need for such a provision. The representor\nwas concerned that the new statutory right might be open to abuse\nby minority shareholders. 138    Section\n216B of the Companies Act is also relevant. Section 216B permits\nthe court to consider the fact that a breach of duty has been approved\nby the members of the company when granting leave under s 216A (even\nthough such approval is not conclusive of whether leave should be\ngranted). 139    The\nabove observations are in turn consonant with the principle of “majority\nrule” enunciated inFoss v Harbottle.\nThis principle states that if the alleged wrong is capable of being\nratified by a majority of shareholders in general meeting, then\nno individual shareholder should be permitted to maintain an action\nin respect of the matter: seeEdwards v Halliwell[1950]\n2 All ER 1064 at 1066. 140    It\nmay therefore be said that the policy of the law has been to treat proceedings\nauthorised by the majority of shareholders in general meeting differently\nfrom those commenced by minority shareholders. To this end, majority\nrule makes contractual sense in most (but clearly not all) cases because\nminority shareholders typically freely chose to become members of a\ncompany. I note also that majority rule is the norm under the Companies Act\nin the exercise of certain corporate powers. To mention just two examples,\nan ordinary resolution in general meeting suffices to authorise the\nissue of shares by a company, or for a company to dispose of all,\nor substantially all, of its assets. 141    Majority\nrule also makes economic sense because the majority has the greater\nincentive to maximise corporate value. In the context of corporate litigation,\nit prevents unnecessary, multiplicitous or vexatious actions being commenced\nin the company name by placing the litigation decision with the\nmajority. This, however, is subject to the caveat that in most cases,\nthe majority’s control over litigation is indirect and exercised\nby removing a board which refuses to act. 142    Further,\nif a minority shareholder feels that proceedings commenced by the\nmajority (whether through the board or in exercise of reserve powers)\nis not in the company’s best interest, that minority shareholder may\napply for leave to discontinue the proceedings under s 216A(2) of\nthe Companies Act. From the viewpoint of policy, this would serve\nas a check against the majority’s power to commence proceedings\nin the company’s name. 143    Finally,\nit bears reiteration that the doctrine of reserve powers does not\ngive a general meetingcarte blanchepowers\nto commence litigation in the company’s name. Rather, as will be\nobvious from the discussion above (see [93] to [123]), reserve powers\nonly arise in exceptional cases and they are narrow in scope. 144    For\nthe reasons stated above, I was satisfied that s 216A of the Companies\nAct does not affect my decision that the EGM had the power to appoint\nsolicitors to commence OS 895. It followed that TSMP’s appointment\nwas valid. 145    My\ndecision (at [144] above) made it unnecessary to consider Mr Thio’s\nother submissions regarding the EGM’s power to appoint solicitors to\ncommence legal proceedings. However, I will do so for completeness. 146    Mr\nThio submitted that leaving aside the issue of reserve powers, the EGM\nnevertheless had the power to appoint solicitors to commence OS 895.\nHe provided two reasons for this. First, he said that the decision\nto commence legal proceedings was not a management decision if it concerned\nthe breach of fiduciary duties by existing directors. Secondly,\nhe said that the general meeting had the power to commence legal\nproceedings where the directors had refused to do so for improper\nmotives. 147    I\ndo not accept Mr Thio’s submission that the decision to commence proceedings\nagainst a recalcitrant director is not a management decision. I do\nnot see how the defendant’s identity alters the nature of the decision\nto be taken. In my view, the real issue in such cases is that the\ndirectors are unable or unwilling to make the relevant litigation\ndecision as fiduciaries: seeWalter Woonat\npara 9.12. 148    Mr\nThio was unable to cite any authority in support of this proposition,\napart from a footnote inHalsbury’s Laws of\nSingaporevol 6 (Butterworths Asia, 2006 Issue) at para\n70.272, which in turn referred to the English Court of Appeal decision\ninBamford v Bamford[1969] 2 WLR 1107\n(“Bamford”). 149    WhileBamforddoes suggest (at 1115) that the\ndecision to commence legal proceedings against errant directors\ncould be made by the shareholders passing an ordinary resolution,\nthis proposition is stated too broadly and it is inconsistent with\nthe division of powers under s 157A (and Art 73 of TYC’s Articles).\nI note thatBamfordreferred toFoss v Harbottlein coming to this conclusion.\nAs mentioned at [70]–[73] above, that case was decided on a basis\nthat does not hold currency today. 150    It\nis also clear that Mr Thio’s submissions on this point were premised on\nshareholders having wide powers of management if the board was unable\nor unwilling to act. In my view, this submission was framed too broadly.\nAny question concerning the general meeting’s power to commence\nproceedings against a recalcitrant director should be approached\nin accordance with the principles set out at [108] above. The EGM’s power to authorise\nHT to unilaterally sign cheques 151    This\nleaves me to address Mr Thio’s further submission that the EGM’s\nreserve powers include the power to authorise HT to unilaterally sign\ncheques on TYC’s behalf. 152    I\ndisagreed with Mr Thio’s submission for two reasons. First, such\na power would have been inconsistent with the Payment Clause which requires\nboth JC and HT to approve payments by TYC. TYC’s shareholders had\nunanimously agreed to the Payment Clause, TYC is bound by it, and the\nPayment Clause cannot be varied unless all TYC shareholders agree\n(see [23]-[25] above). 153    Second,\nTYC’s main complaint in these proceedings was that JC had breached\neither her fiduciary duties as a director of TYC, or an implied term\nof the SSD, by refusing to sign cheques or payment vouchers on TYC’s behalf.\nIn my judgment, it may be reasonable to imply a reserve power which\nallowed the EGM to commence OS 895 - OS 895 would enable the court\nto determine the parties’ rights and obligations under the Divorce Settlement\nAgreements or at general law. 154    However,\nthe same could not be said about a reserve power which would, in\neffect, allow the EGM to determine payment matters for itself, or worse,\nto re-write the rights and obligations of the parties under the\nSSD. 155    It\nfollows that the EGM could not authorise HT to unilaterally sign cheques\nand make payments on TYC’s behalf.",
        "Specific Performance": "156    I\nturn, then, to Mr Thio’s alternative submission that the court should specifically\norder JC to sign cheques or payment vouchers for TYC to make payment\nof the KPMG Fees, the TSMP Fees and the Express Co Fees. He based\nthis submission on two grounds: (a)     First,\nthere is an implied term in the TYC Deed that HT and JC’s power\nto approve any payment by TYC under the Payment Clause cannot be\nexercised dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously or\narbitrarily (“the Implied Term”). By refusing to approve payment\nof these fees, JC had breached the Implied Term. (a)     I shall refer to this as the “Implied Term Argument”. (b)     Second,\nby refusing to approve payment of these fees, JC has breached her\nfiduciary duties as a director of TYC. The court is therefore able\nto remedy such breach by way of an order for specific performance\npursuant to s 409A of the Companies Act. (b)     I shall refer to this as the “Fiduciary Duty Argument”. Implied Term Argument 157    Mr\nThio submitted that the Implied Term formed part of the SSD (and\nby extension, the TYC Deed) because the Implied Term satisfied the three-step\nframework described by the Court of Appeal inSembcorp Marine\nLtd v PPL Holdings Pte Ltd and another and another appeal[2013]\n4 SLR 193 (“Sembcorp Marine”). 158    Under\nthis three-step framework, a term would be impliedin\nfactin an agreement if: (a)     there\nis a gap in the contract which was not contemplated by the parties; (b)     it\nis necessary to imply in a term, typically in the business or commercial\nsense, to give the contract efficacy; and (c)     the\nspecific term to be implied must be one which the parties, having\nregard to the need for (typically) business efficacy, would have responded\n“Oh, of course!” had they been asked at the time of the contract\nwhether the term should form part of the contract. (1)   Application of theSembcorp Marineframework (A)   The first step 159    The\nfirst step begins with the question of whether there was a gap in the\nSSD. 160    To\nme, this was straightforward: the party coming to court merely has to\ntell the court what it perceives the gap to be, and why the gap\nis a “true” gap, that is, the parties did not at all contemplate\nthe issue which is now sought to be addressed by way of an implied\nterm (seeSembcorp Marineat [94]–[96]).\nVinodh Coomaraswamy J’s approach inTan Chin\nYew JosephvSaxo Capital Markets Pte Ltd[2013] SGHC\n274 at [51] demonstrates correctly how the first step ought to be\napplied. 161    Mr\nThio argued that the gap in the SSD is that neither the Payment Clause\nnor any other term in the SSD provides what should happen if either HT\nor JC paralysed TYC by withholding approval to the making of payments\nby TYC. To fully appreciate this argument, it is necessary to explain\nthe background leading up to agreement on the Payment Clause. 162    After\nthe divorce but prior to the implementation of the payment system\nunder the Payment Clause, HT alleged that JC had unilaterally made unauthorised\npayments out of TYC’s bank accounts. HT then commenced court proceedings\nin 2011 to obtain an injunction to restrain JC from making unilateral\npayment decisions (“OS 1080”). However, OS 1080 was discontinued\nin June 2012 without HT obtaining the reliefs that he had sought. 163    Mr\nThio submitted that the discontinuation of OS 1080 and the Payment\nClause were connected – the Payment Clause was inserted in the SSD\nto ensure that future payments made by TYC would not be improper, capricious\nor arbitrary. 164    I\naccepted that there was such a connection between OS 1080 and the Payment\nClause. Clause 18 of the SSD expressly provided that the parties agreed\nto discontinue OS 1080 despite HT not receiving any of the reliefs that\nhe had sought. Given that HT and JC remained the only two directors of\nTYC even after their divorce, it must have occurred to them – or\nin any event it was reasonable to infer – that their status post-divorce\nmay cause problems in their joint-management of TYC (especially\nin relation to the control of TYC’s purse strings). 165    To\nthat end, the Payment Clause was an understandable check and balance\nto the problem of unilateral payment decisions by either HT and JC. 166    The\nparties probably did not foresee that the Payment Clause could give\nrise to a different problem. To some extent it was ironic, but not\ntotally unexpected. When the Payment Clause was conceived, HT and\nJC were trying to solve a very narrow issue, that is, how to prevent\neither of them from unilaterally causing TYC tomakepayments\nwithout the consent of the other. 167    HT\nand JC had not addressed their minds to the converse potentiality, that\nis, whether there was a need by either party to prevent the other\nfrom unilaterally causing TYC towithholdpayments\ndespite the other having given approval. In other words, they had\nnot contemplated that the very power that they had given to themselves\nto prevent improper, capricious and arbitrary payments by the other\nmight be turned on its head to cause, in Mr Thio’s words, improper,\ncapricious or arbitrary withholding of payment of legitimate expenses\nincurred by TYC. 168    Therefore,\nI agreed with Mr Thio that there was a gap in the SSD and by extension,\nthe TYD Deed (because TYC’s rights and obligations flow from the\nTYC Deed, not the SSD). 169    The\nfirst of theSembcorp Marineframework\nwas therefore satisfied. I turn then to the second step. (B)   The second step 170    The\npurpose of the second step is again quite straightforward, that\nis, to determine whether the transaction is efficacious despite\nthe gap. 171    If\nthe transaction is efficacious despite the gap, it would not be necessary\nto imply in any term, and the argument for the implication of a term\ncomes to an end. The second step, understood in this sense, is not applied\nto determine whether a gap exists. It is not the same as the business efficacy\ntest understood in the normal sense when applied as a self-standing test\n(see [90] to [98] ofSembcorp Marine). 172    English\nlaw appears to have adopted a more relaxed standard. InMarks and Spencer PLC v BNP Paribas Securities Services\nTrust Company (Jersey) Limited & Air[2014] EWCA\nCiv 603 at [28], the English Court of Appeal held that “a party\ndoes not show that a term is unnecessary simply by showing that\nthe parties’ agreement could work without the implied term.” On\nthe face of this proposition, it would appear that a term is less likely\nto be implied under Singapore law as compared to English law. The difference,\nin my view, is perhaps more apparent than substantive. 173    One\nway to justify this “conservatism” under Singapore law (Sembcorp Marineat [88]) is to think of\nthe court’s role as being limited to giving the “minimum of efficacy”\nto the contract (The Moorcock(1889)\n4 PD 64 at 69). The court’s role is not to ameliorate the parties’\nbargain. As Lord Pearson said inTrollope &\nColls Ltd v North West Metropolitan Regional Hospital Board[1973]\n1 WLR 601 at 609, the court will notimprovea\ncontract which the parties have made, however desirable the improvement\nmay be (seeSembcorp Marineat [88]).\nThere is also no rule of contract law (either generally or specifically)\nin relation to implied terms that if a term can be implied to prevent\nloss to one party, that term is necessary for the efficacy of the\ntransaction and ought to be implied. 174    The\npower to imply terms into a contract should not be considered as routine.\nIt is so intrusive that Sir Thomas Bingham MR called it an “extraordinary\npower” inPhilips Electronique Grand Public\nSA and Another v British Sky Broadcasting Limited[1995]\nEMLR 472 at 481. This is why the threshold for implied terms in\nfact is consistently expressed as being high (seeSembcorp\nMarineat [100]; see also Lord Grabiner, “The Iterative Process\nof Contractual Interpretation (2012) 128 LQR 41 at p 59). 175    Leaving\naside specific policy considerations that vary from case to case,\na principal reason for the restrained approach of the law towards\nthe implication of terms into a contract is that every term implied\nis ultimately an exercise in guesswork by the court. 176    The\ndanger with the introduction of guesswork – albeit informed and principled\n– into a contract after the bargain has been concluded between the\nparties was aptly summarised by Sundaresh Menon CJ (extra-judicially) in\n“The Somewhat Uncommon Law of Commerce” (2014) 26 SAcLJ 23 at [18]: The obvious dangerwith implication, being by its nature an exercise\nin filling in what parties had not addressed their minds to,is that the court might too easily rewrite the contract\nto its own preference.Lawyers\nare not generally noted for an awareness of their own limitations;\nand there is therefore aninevitable temptationto try to supplement or improve the contract, or\nto recast it in accordance with the court’s sense of the justice\nof the case, and in the process,lose\nsight of the actual bargainthat\nwas struck between the parties. This isespecially\ndangerousbecause that bargain would\nhave been struck at a time when the parties would have been looking\nahead and pricing the inherent uncertainties that this must entail.It is impossible for a court to factor this in meaningfully\nat the time it comes to examine the issue with the clarity of perfect\nhindsight.The uncertainty and unpredictability generated\nby this mismatch is wont to constitute a grave disservice to people\nof commerce if judges fail to keep such realities firmly in mind.\n[original emphasis omitted; emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 177    People\nlooking on from the outside without being involved in the process\nof negotiation and bargaining which led to final agreement are seldom\nin a position to predict with any degree of accuracy what the parties were\ntruly thinking had a particular issue been put squarely to them.\nIt is one thing to say that objectively, this is what the parties\nmust have intended or assumed; it is another thing altogether to\nsay that the objective perspective reflected, intruth,\nthe parties’ positions at that time. It is therefore important that\nthe courts adopt a conservative approach in the implication of terms\ninto a contract. 178    Against\nthis canvass of conservatism, Mr Thio had to satisfy the court that\nthe gap caused by the Payment Clause was one which needed to be plugged\nin order for the SSD to be efficacious. The question was whether “for\nthe sake of efficacy of [the SSD] something more needs to be added\nto [the SSD]” (seeSembcorp Marineat\n[91]). 179    For\nthe reasons that follow, I was not persuaded that the gap caused by\nthe Payment Clause was one which needed to be plugged in order for\nthe SSD to be efficacious. 180    At\nthe outset, I accepted that the management of TYC was an integral aspect\nof the SSD. Although the Divorce Settlement Agreements were a private\nmatter between HT and JC, the bulk of their combined and individual\nwealth was represented by their respective founder shares in TYC\nand the consequent control and voting rights conferred on these founder\nshares (see [14] above). It was therefore inevitable that TYC had\nto be part of, and party to, the Divorce Settlement Agreements. 181    With\nthe introduction of TYC (with its significant stake in THG, a listed\nentity), the implementation of the Divorce Settlement Agreements was\nnever going to be simple or straightforward. Contractual rights\nwere conferred, and obligations imposed, on TYC. The settlement\nalso reflected the parties’ agreement on how TYC should be managed.\nA wide spectrum of management issues were covered, including a TYC\ndividend policy, TYC’s responsibility to pay a host of expenses\n– medical fees and insurance for the family, as well as the costs,\ntaxes and outgoings of various properties. TYC’s liability for the\nexpenses of 40C Nassim Road was just one example. 182    In\naddition, these new rights and obligations placed TYC in an unenviable\nposition because there was the theoretical possibility that TYC may\nhave to enforce those rights against either HT or JC; or conversely, TYC\nmay be sued by HT or JC if TYC defaulted on its obligations to either. Perhaps\nthis would not be an issue if TYC had directors on its board other than\nHT and JC, but that was not the case. It was also not the case that\nHT and JC were mere strangers who happened to be the only two directors\nof TYC. 183    Given\nthe extensive role that TYC was made to play in the divorce settlement,\nthe issue of how TYC would be managed post-divorce would undoubtedly\naffect the efficacy of the execution and implementation of the Divorce\nSettlement Agreements. Thus, whether and when TYC would meet its\npayment obligations was undoubtedly an issue which went towards\nthe efficacy of the SSD. 184    That,\nhowever, was not conclusive because even if the SSD had a gap that\nundermined the workability of the SSD, it did not follow as a matter\nof course that it was necessary, for the minimum of business efficacy,\nthat a term needs to be implied into the SSD. If there were other\nmeans by which this gap could be ameliorated, the consequences of\nthe gap on the efficacy of the SSD would be similarly limited. 185    On\nthis critical issue, it was my view that the gap caused by the Payment\nClause was adequately ameliorated by the existing duties imposed as\na matter of law on HT and JC, namely, the duties imposed on directors pursuant\nto s 157(1) of the Companies Act and at general law. 186    Section\n157(1) states that “[a] director shall at all times act honestly and\nuse reasonable diligence in the discharge of the duties of his office.” This\nis a broad and wide-ranging duty which encompasses the following obligations: (a)     A\ndirector shall “actbona fideto\npromote or advance the interests of the company”:Ho\nKang Peng v Scintronix Corp Ltd (formerly known as TTL Holdings\nLtd)[2014] 3 SLR 329 (“Scintronix”)\nat [35]. A corollary of this obligation is that the director must\nbe “genuinely acting to promote the company’s interest”; whether\nor not this is objectively the case is a matter within the court’s purview\n(Scintronixat [38]). (b)     A\ndirector shall not bedishonest,\neven if he subjectively thought that being dishonest – by bribing\nto win business contracts, to take the most extreme example – was\nin the interest of the company. The Court of Appeal inScintronixflatly rejected (at [40]) the\nsuggestion that a director who created a sham contract and made\nunauthorised and irregular payments out of the company’s funds for\nthe purpose of securing business for the company can be said to\nbe acting genuinely in the interests of the company. The rationale,\nthe court explained, was that profit maximisation “by any means”\ncan never be in the interests of the company. (c)     A\ndirector shall not exercise his office and the powers that the office\nconfers for animproper purpose.\nAgain, this rule applies even if the director had considered himself\nas genuinely acting in the interests of the company:Walter Woonat paras 8.76 to 8.82. (d)     A\ndirector shall not make a decisioncapriciouslyandarbitrarilyas such manner of decision-making\ncan never be, by definition, one that was genuinely taken in the\ninterests of the company. At best, a decision made capriciously\nor arbitrarily is one which pays no regard to the company’s interest;\nat worst, it fully contradicts the duty of directors to exercise\nreasonable diligence, which has been read into the scope of s 157(1)\nof the Companies Act:Walter Woonat\npara 8.118. 187    To\nrecapitulate, the Implied Term imposes a fetter on the power HT and\nJC each enjoyed under the Payment Clause. Neither can exercise such power\ndishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily. Given\nthe broad obligations that come within the ambit of s 157(1) of\nthe Companies Act, including those fleshed out at [186] above, I\nwould think that if either HT or JC had exercised the power to withhold\napproval of payments in a manner that was dishonest, capricious,\narbitrary or for an improper purpose, such exercise of power would\nlikely constitute a breach of director’s duties. The scope of the\nImplied Term was, in my view, a subset of the existing obligations\nthat HT and JCalready owe to TYCin their\ncapacity as directors of TYC. 188    In\nthese circumstances, and bearing in mind the conservatism that overhangs\nthe entire process of implication of terms, I could not see how\nit was necessary, for the efficacy of the SSD, that the Implied\nTerm was required. Any withholding of approval of payment by JC\nfor clearly legitimate TYC expenses was and can be controlled by\nher duties owed to TYC as a director. 189    I\nwas assisted in my conclusion at [188] above by the arguments that were\nmade on the Nassim Road Expenses (although that claim has since been\nsettled (see [62] above)). Under cl 5(a) of Appendix B of the DOS, TYC\nis liable to pay all “costs, taxes and outgoings” in connection\nwith 40C Nassim Road. The arguments between the parties concerned\nthe ambit of these words. Mr Thuraisingam argued that “renovation”\nexpenses were not covered by these words; Mr Thio argued that no\nwords of limitation should apply to cl 5(a), and all expenditure\non 40C Nassim Road is included. 190    In\nresponse to Mr Thio’s argument, I had asked Mr Thio whether TYC\nwould be liable to pay if HT were to spend $10 million on extravagant renovations\n– say, gold-plating the swimming pool. Mr Thio submitted this would\nnot happen as expenditure on the Nassim Road bungalows would be controlled\nby HT’s fiduciary duties. The underlying principle in Mr Thio’s answer\naccorded with my view, which is that the check against any abuse\nis the fact that HT is a director of TYC. Just as a term need not\nbe implied in cl 5(a), I did not think that the Implied Term needed\nto be implied in the Payment Clause. 191    It\ncould have been argued – though it was not – that the Implied Term governed\nHT and JC’s contractual duty to each other (and TYC) in their personal\ncapacities, and that this was a duty that was wholly different from a\ndirector’s duty which is owed to the company (and not to other shareholders\nor directors). The difficulty, perhaps, was that TYC was the party\nseeking to enforce the obligation under the Implied Term, not HT. 192    Be\nthat as it may, even if this submission had been made, it would\nnot have made a difference to my analysis – in my view, the Payment\nClause was a contractual promise by HT and JC to each other (and\nsubsequently, TYC) in their capacities as directors of TYC. Although\nthe SSD was entered into between HT and JC as a private settlement\npursuant to a divorce, this did not alter their status as directors\nwhich, to me, is the only capacity that they could have contemplated\nwas their bargain in relation to the Payment Clause. And this is\nbecause the Payment Clause deals solely with expenses of TYC. 193    The\nscope of the Implied Term was perhaps fashioned by reference toParagon Finance plc v Nash and another[2002]\n1 WLR 685 (“Paragon Finance”) which\nMr Thio cited. In that case, two mortgages over residential property\ncontained a provision which permitted the lender discretion to vary\nthe interest rate. The borrowers submitted that the lender’s discretion to\nset rates ought to be fettered by an implied term that the rates\nwould not be set “dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously\nor arbitrarily”. This found currency with the English Court of Appeal. 194    Dyson\nLJ (as he then was) explained that the court accepted the implied\nterm because the court found the situation without the implied term\nto be unpalatable. He noted (at [30]–[31]) that without the implied term,\nthe lender would be completely free, in theory at least, to specify\nan interest rate at the most exorbitant level; raise the interest\nrate because it found the borrower to be a nuisance (an improper\npurpose); or raise the interest rate because its manager did not\nlike the colour of the borrower’s hair (a capricious reason). Notwithstanding,\nthe court concluded (at [47]) that there was no breach of the implied\nterm on the facts as the lender’s raising of the interest rate was\na commercial judgment and not for dishonest or capricious purposes\nor otherwise arbitrary. 195Paragon Financeis materially different\nfrom the present case in a number of aspects, first of which is\nthe parties’ relationship. Unlike the borrowers inParagon\nFinance, who had little bargaining leverage against the\nlender, neither HT nor JC here entered into the SSD on an unequal footing.\nDyson LJ’s tone illuminates the main concern that the court had, namely,\nthe inequality of the parties’ relative positions should there be\nno implied fetter on the lender’s discretion. This was sufficient\nfor the court to infer that at the time the borrowers and lender\nentered into the mortgage, the expectation was that the lender’s\nright to vary its interest rate was necessarily fettered to the\nextent that it could not raise the interest rate dishonestly, for\nan improper purpose, capriciously or arbitrarily. 196    The\nsecond and more important difference is that there was no other control\nagainst the lender, unlike the existence of overarching director’s duties\nimposed at law in the present case. 197    Mr\nThio also referred me toEquitable Life Assurance\nSociety v Hyman[2002] 1 AC 408 (“Equitable\nLife”). The main issue in that case before the House\nof Lords was whether the discretion conferred on directors by the articles\nof association of a mutual life assurance society was restricted\nby an implied term that the directors could not adopt a course of\naction that had the effect of overriding or undermining the guaranteed\nannuity rate (which was a critical feature of the policy). Article\n65 of the society’s articles of association conferred on the directors\nabsolute discretion in declaring the amount of bonus to be paid\nout to policyholders. The directors of the society had adopted a\npolicy of declaring a lower final bonus to policyholders of a certain\ncategory. The society sought a declaration from the court that it\nwas entitled to adopt such a course. 198    Lord\nSteyn, delivering the leading judgment of the court, held (at 459) that\nthe discretion conferred by Art 65 was restricted by an implied\nterm under which the directors were precluded from depriving the\nguaranteed bonus to the policyholders. He explained that the provision\nfor guaranteed annuity rates was a selling point in the marketing\nby the society of its policies, and was obviously a significant\nattraction for purchasers of those policies. Thus, “the supposition\nof the parties must be presumed to have been that the directors\nwould not exercise their discretion in conflict with the parties’\ncontractual rights.” 199    Plainly,\nthe facts and holding inEquitable Lifeare\nvery different from the present case. Factually, the term sought\nto be implied inEquitable Lifewas\nnothing like that in the present case. The implied term there restricted the\ndirector’s power under the articles of association to undermine\nthe fundamental purpose of the contract entered into between the policyholders\nand the society. There was no such concern in the present case. 200    Legally,\nthe decision inEquitable Lifehas\nno bearing on the present case because all that was established\nin that case was that the discretion of the directors of a society\nto affect a policy, which discretion was conferred contractually\nby the articles of association (and not a statutory or fiduciary duty\nimposed by law), was subject to an implied term that the discretion\nis not exercised in a manner that conflicts with the rights of the\npolicyholders. Existing director’s duties would have been insufficient\nbecause the directors could be genuinely acting in the interests\nof the society in exercising the power in the articles of association\nin a way that defeats the purpose that the policyholders had in\nmind when they contracted with the society. 201    To\nhis credit, Mr Thio did not overstateEquitable\nLife. His strongest point in relation to that case was\na reference to Lord Cooke’s judgment that no legal discretion, however\nwidely worded, could be exercised for purposes contrary to those\nof the instrument by which it is conferred. Again, that is simply\nanother way of saying that the scope of the discretion under the articles\nof association must be read in the light of the purpose of the contract\nbetween the society and policyholders. I found nothing wrong with that\nstatement of principle but I did not see how it was materially relevant to\nthe principal submission that the Implied Term ought to be recognised\nas forming part of the SSD. 202    I\nshall address a couple of other authorities that I found apposite.\nThe first isBrogden v Investec Bank Plc[2014]\nEWHC 2785 (Comm) (“Investec”). In\nthat case, the plaintiffs were former employees of the defendant\nbank. They were seeking damages from the defendant for breach of\ncontract in failing to pay them bonuses which they claimed were\na matter of right and not discretionary. The defendant’s main argument\nwas that the plaintiffs were simply not entitled to any bonus under\nthe contractual formula for calculating bonus entitlement. The plaintiffs\ncontended that the defendant bank had acted in bad faith or irrationally\nin manipulating or adjusting the inputs into the formula that resulted\nin the conclusion that no bonus was payable. This was a breach of\nthe defendant’s implied duty to exercise its discretion in good\nfaith, and not in an arbitrary, capricious or irrational manner. 203    Leggatt\nJ, after surveying the authorities dealing with clauses granting discretion\nto one of the contracting parties to the contract, agreed that there was\nsuch a general implied duty in principle (at [100]): Both on the authorities and as a matter\nof principle, it seems to me that where a contract gives responsibility\nto one party for making an assessment or exercising a judgement\non a matter which materially affects the other party’s interests\nand about which there is ample scope for reasonable differences\nof view,the decision is properly regarded\nas a discretion which is subject to the implied constraints that\nit must be taken in good faith, for proper purposes and not in an\narbitrary, capricious or irrational manner. … The concern,\nas Rix LJ observed inSocimerat\npara 66, is that the decision-maker’s power should not be abused.\nThe implication is justified as a matter of construction to give effect\nto the presumed intention of the parties. … [emphasis added] 204    The\ndecision of Rix LJ referred to by Leggatt J isSocimer\nInternational Bank Ltd v Standard Bank London Ltd[2008]\n1 Lloyd’s Rep 558 (“Socimer”). That\ncase concerned the right of the defendant under a contract to either\nliquidate or retain a portfolio of assets belonging to the plaintiff\nupon a defaulting event. The value of the assets to be liquidated\nor retained was to be determined by the defendant at the date of\ntermination of the contract. However, the defendant did not carry\nout any valuation of the assets (which the defendant sold in dribs\nand drabs). The plaintiff, through its liquidator, then brought\nproceedings claiming that it was entitled to a larger sum than had\nbeen credited by the defendant. 205    The\nissue inSocimer(that was relevant\nto the present case) was whether the defendant was under an implied\nobligation to take reasonable care to ascertain the true market\nvalue of the plaintiff’s assets, notwithstanding that the valuation\nclause provided the defendant with the discretion to determine the\nvalue of those assets. The court disagreed (at [116]) with the plaintiff’s\nsubmission that the implied term was necessary to prevent abuse\ncaused by the defendant’s self-interest. 206    In\nthe court’s view, there were other general implied controls guarding\nagainst such abuse. Rix LJ, who delivered the leading judgment of the\nEnglish Court of Appeal, explained that clauses giving one party\na power to make decisions under the contract which may have an effect\non both parties are (at [66]): … limited, as a matter of necessary implication,\nby concepts of honesty, good faith, and genuineness, and the need\nfor the absence of arbitrariness, capriciousness, perversity and\nirrationality. The concern is that the discretion should not be\nabused. … 207    This\ngeneral limitation was considered by the court to be less extensive\nthan the implied term sought by the plaintiff (see [67] ofSocimer) because whilst the implied duty\nto take reasonable care to ascertain the true market value effectively\nimposes on the defendant what the court considers to be a reasonable\nmarket value, the general implied limitation does not take away\nfrom the defendant its discretion to decide what, in its subjective view,\namounted to a reasonable valuation. The general implied limitation (see\nthe excerpt reproduced at [206] above) only required the defendant\nto exercise its subjective judgment rationally and in good faith\n(see [112] ofSocimer). 208    These\nauthorities seemed to suggest that a party which is given an exclusive\nright under a contract to make a decision that may adversely affect another\nparty to the contract is under an obligation to exercise that discretion,\nat minimum, in a manner that is not arbitrary, capricious, perverse\nor irrational. In my judgment, I did not think that this proposition was\na principle that applies in all circumstances and in relation to\nall contracts where such clauses are concerned. I say this for a\nnumber of reasons. 209    First,\nthese are situations concerning implication of terms in fact, not law.\nGiven that whether a term is implied in fact depends on the circumstances\nof each case, there cannot be a general principle that applies to\nall contracts conferring such discretions. To put it another way,\nif a party has freely agreed to give another party an unfettered\ndiscretion to make decisions that may adversely affect both parties\nto the contract, the two parties ought to be permitted to contract\nas such. I know of no general principle or policy that restricts\nthe parties’ freedom to enter into such agreements. In ascertaining\nthe parties’ presumed intentions, the court is precisely trying\nto determine whether the parties could have agreed on such a course\nof plan. This is why presumed intention has to be assessed on a case-by-case\nbasis and cannot be subject to an overarching general proposition. 210    Second,\nin all of the authorities that I have been referred to or otherwise\ncame across, the relationship between the contracting parties were\ndifferent from that between HT, JC and TYC. The cases which have recognised\nan implied term similar to the Implied Term concerned a society\nand policyholders (Equitable Life),\nan ordinary retail borrower and a commercial lender (Paragon Finance), employees and an employer\nbank (Investec), and a commercial\nborrower and a commercial lender (Socimer). None\nof these were remotely close to the situation of a contract entered\ninto between owners of a company who were also its only directors\nand in the midst of divorce proceedings. 211    Third,\ngiven HT and JC’s position as entrenched directors of TYC (see [13]\nabove), the need for a general limitation, as was necessary inSocimerandInvestec,\nfor example, was at least questionable if not entirely obviated\nby the directors’ duties imposed on HT and JC by s 157(1) of the Companies\nAct and more broadly at general law. Just as the court inSocimerheld that the duty to take reasonable\ncare in obtaining a valuation was unnecessary because any abuse\nof self-interest was taken care of by the generally implied limitation\ninherent in clauses conferring discretion (see [207] above), it\nwould also be unnecessary to recognise the Implied Term in the SSD.\nThe duties imposed on HT and JC, as directors, have the same content\nand prophylactic effect as the Implied Term. 212    Given\nthat there was a pre-existing set of obligations owed by HT and JC\nto TYC that served the same purpose as the Implied Term, I concluded that\nthe SSD was not inefficacious despite the gap caused by the Payment Clause.\nConsequently, it was not necessary for something additional to be implied\nto the SSD. 213    TYC’s\ncase for the implication of terms therefore ended here. (C)   The third step 214    For\ncompleteness, and on the assumption that I was wrong on the second\nstep, I shall give my views on the third step. 215    The\napplication of the third step of the framework posits the hypothetical\nquestion: what would the parties’ response be if an officious bystander\nhad suggested that aspecificterm\nshould form part of the parties’ agreement? The court will only\nimply the term suggested by the officious bystander if the court\nis persuaded that the parties’ response to the officious bystander\nwould be “Oh, of course!”. 216    There\nare two ways I could be wrong with respect to the second step. Consequently,\nthere would be two different outcomes depending on how I was wrong. 217    First,\nI could be wrong in that the existing directors’ duties did not mirror,\nor at least capture the scope of, the Implied Term, such that a director’s\nexercise of a power dishonestly, for an improper purpose, capriciously\nor arbitrarily is of a different nature from, and not subsumed by,\nthe duties imposed by s 157(1) of the Companies Act or at general\nlaw. 218    If\nI were wrong on this point, I would agree with Mr Thio that the Implied\nTerm ought to be implied as it would have passed muster under the third\nstep of theSembcorp Marineframework.\nHT and JC would have approved the Implied Term to supplement the\ninsufficiency left notwithstanding their existing directors’ duties. 219    Second,\nI could be wrong on a separate point in that although the director\nduties mirrored, or at least captured the scope of the Implied Term, the\nSSD was nonetheless inefficacious notwithstanding such existing directors’\nduties. Here, I did not think that the third step would have been satisfied. 220    If\nthe existing directors’ duties mirrored or captured the scope of\nthe Implied Term, but for some reason the Payment Clause was still\ninsufficient for the efficacy of the SSD, HT and JC would, I think,\nhave questioned the relevance of the Implied Term. They would not\nhave responded with “Oh, of course!” when asked if the Implied Term\nformed part of the SSD. To put it another way, if the Implied Term\nis in any event a subset of the directors’ duties incumbent on HT\nand JC, and the existence of those same directors’ duties is considered\ninadequate in remedying the gap, HT and JC would not have seen any\nadditional benefit that the Implied Term would provide. (2)   Whether JC breached\nthe Implied Term by refusing to pay the KPMG Fees 221    For\ncompleteness, I shall explain why I did not think that JC had breached\nthe Implied Term in respect of her refusal to approve payment of KPMG\nFees. Here, I proceed on the basis that I was wrong, and that the Implied\nTerm should be implied in the Payment Clause. 222    No\nsubmission was pressed on JC’s refusal to approve payment of the TSMP\nFees and the Express Co Fees, and rightly so, because it was manifestly\nclear that her refusal to approve the two payments stemmed from\nher honest belief that the EGM had not been validly convened and consequently,\nTSMP was not properly appointed (see [50] above). 223    The\ncourts have been slow in interfering with commercial decisions of directors\nwhich have been made honestly even if they turn out, on hindsight,\nto be financially detrimental (Intraco Ltd\nv Multi-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd[1994] 3 SLR(R) 1064 at\n[30]). Part of the reason for this wide margin of deference is that\n“it is theoretically possible for a board of directors to make a\ndecision which is commercially ludicrous and yet act perfectly honestly”\n(seeWalter Woonat para 8.36). 224    As\nLord Greene MR said inIn reSmith and Fawcett Ltd[1942] Ch 304 at\n306 (which was cited with approval by the Court of Appeal inScintronixat [37]), directors “must exercise\ntheir discretionbona fidein what\nthey consider – not what a court may consider – is in the interests\nof the company”. What matters, therefore, is the directors’ intention,\nnot the consequences of the directors’ decision, however detrimental.\nThe consequences may, however, sometimes be a useful indicator of\nintention. 225    JC’s\nmain complaint against KPMG was that they never contacted her in\nthe course of carrying out their work, even though the scope of\ntheir work involved evaluating, followed by advising, HT and JC\non their respective individual income tax position. There were other\naspects relating to TYC’s corporate tax but that was not disputed\nby JC. Mr Thio rejected this argument, submitting that JC’s refusal\nto authorise payment of the KPMG Fees had no basis because she had\nnot even read the report or sought advice on whether the report\nwas accurate. He also referred to a term of the engagement which\nprovided that the KPMG Fees are not contingent “upon the results\nof [their] engagement”. 226    In\nmy view, the fact that there is such a term was, at best, neutral. Otherwise,\na director would be compelled to authorise payment under contracts\nwhich contains such a term even if the director were genuinely of the\nview that the counterparty had breached the contract in a way which made\nit commercially sensible, from a business perspective, to withhold payment\nor to secure a reduction in the amount payable. Or to set-off any counterclaim\nfor breach. It may also be commercially sensible for a company seeking\nto cure a breach to withhold payment so that the cure would be more\nforthcoming. Whether the contractual obligation to pay was absolute\nunder the law is irrelevant. 227    JC\nadmitted in cross-examination that she had not read the report by KPMG.\nMr Thio submitted that JC could not have adopted an honest view that\nKPMG had not discharged its obligations fully or properly because\nshe had not read the report. I disagreed. 228    JC\nknew – and it was not disputed by HT or Mr Thio – that KPMG did\nnot consult her. It was also undisputed that KPMG’s role included\nan assessment of the parties’ individual income tax position. In\nfact, as Mr Thuraisingam submitted, HT conceded during cross-examination\nthat it was not unreasonable for JC to take issue with the report\nby KPMG because it affected her personal income tax. 229    In\nfact, when JC initially refused to approve payment, a meeting was scheduled\nwith KPMG on 5 April 2013. It was at this meeting that JC tore up\nthe KMPG report, a fact that Mr Thio stressed during cross-examination and\nin his submissions to highlight JC’s attitude towards the matter. Leaving\nthat aside, what JC had said in that meeting was helpful to understanding\nthe crux of her issue with KPMG. This was what she said during her\ncross-examination: I said [to the KPMG team leader]: “Mun\nChuan, you can’t be doing my income tax.” I then qualified with\nhim: “How could you have done it?” He says: “I was given the DOS\nand all those report.” I said: “Surely, you then should have asked\nme am I staying in 15 Nassim Road because you are indicating just\nbecause it’s in DOS that I’m staying there. … I’m staying in Reflection\n[the name of a condominium] and everywhere else has got nothing\nto do with the DOS. I was physically not staying there. I have got\nto be honest and truthful and therefore I cannot accept it without\nyou coming to discuss with me and I have been trying to [tell] Grace\nWong telling her at all times I want to see the KPMG people. … 230    Her\npoint was simple, and in my view, fair. KPMG had premised its assessment\nof JC’s income tax on the assumption, having regard to the DOS,\nthat JC was staying in a condominium unit at 15 Nassim Road. JC\nfelt that KPMG should not have made that assumption without clarifying\nwith her because she was not staying at 15 Nassim Road, but somewhere\nelse (or so she claimed). JC’s point was that if KPMG had consulted\nher and sought the necessary information, they would have discovered\nthe discrepancy, and their assessment would have been different. 231    I\nnote, at this juncture, that this issue of the impact of the Divorce Settlement\nAgreements on JC’s income tax was not entirely trivial. On this part\nof KPMG’s assessment, JC’s occupation of the condominium unit at\n15 Nassim Road was likely to be treated as a taxable employment\nbenefit. Both sides appeared to have accepted that the value of\nthis taxable employment benefit is in the region of $200,000. 232    It\nmust be remembered that KPMG were contracted to perform services\nwhich were in their nature qualitative. It was not as if KPMG were only\nengaged to undertake a simple mathematical exercise which involved inputs\nthat were free of any judgment or analytical assessment. KPMG had to\nmake judgment calls which may vary depending on the parameters that they\nused. JC’s point was that KPMG ought to have checked with her on\nthe accuracy of the parameters before they rendered their opinion\non the effect of the Divorce Settlement Agreements on her personal\nincome tax. The force of her contention, framed this way, was difficult\nto ignore. 233    I\nwould make a final observation. The dispute over payment here did not\nrelate to a supply of basic consumables, but to the provision of professional\nservices. A dispute over the quality of professional services rendered\ngenerally involves a greater measure of subjective judgment; and the\nclient receiving such services should be given some latitude if\nit genuinely believes that there was a deficiency in the quality\nof services for which payment should be withheld. 234    In\nthese circumstances, I did not think that JC’s stance was one which “no\ndirector could honestly believe to be taken in the interests of\nthe company” (seeCheam Tat Pang and another\nv Public Prosecutor[1996] 1 SLR(R) 161 at [80]). I considered\nthis margin of deference that should be afforded to directors. I\nalso considered the fact that she had reached out to KPMG to lodge\nher dissatisfaction (see [229] above). While I thought that JC was\nperhaps not the easiest of clients (quadirector\nof TYC) to deal with, I found that she did approach the issue of\npayment of the KPMG Fees with an honest,bona\nfidebelief that KPMG ought not to be paid (then or perhaps\nat all) because it had not discharged fully or properly its obligations under\nthe terms of the engagement. Fiduciary Duty Argument 235    The\nFiduciary Duty Argument was based on JC’s refusal to authorise payment\nof the KPMG Fees. This is said to be concurrently a breach of JC’s fiduciary\nduties which she owed as a director of TYC. 236    For\nthe same reasons that I gave at [223] to [234], I did not accept\nthat JC had breached her fiduciary duties.",
        "Conclusion": "237    Although\nI held that TSMP was validly appointed by the resolutions passed\nat the EGM, and that TYC is therefore liable to pay TSMP and Express\nCo for the services respectively rendered, I was not in a position\nto make a determination on whether the TSMP Fees and the Express\nCo Fees, in terms of quantum, were reasonable and ought to be paid\nby TYC. These were matters for TYC and its directors to decide,\nand not the court, at least not in these present proceedings. 238    In\nsum, save for Consent Order No 1 and Consent Order No 2 which remained\nvalid and binding on the parties, and prayers relating to costs\nand liberty to apply, I dismissed OS 895 in its entirety.",
        "Costs": "239    Mr\nThuraisingam submitted that JC was prepared to pay costs of $20,000\nin relation to the two Consent Orders that were made only after proceedings\nhad commenced. He however sought costs of $50,000 for the dismissal\nof OS 895. Mr Thio sought costs of approximately $112,000 (factoring\nin reasonable disbursements) on a global basis. 240    Although\nI dismissed most of the prayers sought by TYC, I recognised that\nthe majority of the claims by TYC had been settled by way of the\ntwo Consent Orders that were entered into only after proceedings\nhad commenced, and only after quite a few hearings. Therefore, it\nseemed fair that TYC should get some of its costs from JC. For that\nreason, on a global basis and after factoring in the costs that\nMr Thuraisingam claimed should be awarded to JC for the dismissal\nof OS 895, I awarded TYC $20,000 in costs payable by JC. I ordered\nHT to bear his own costs."
