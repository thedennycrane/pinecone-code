        "I was afraid that if Tan Jek Cheng did not want to admit those things found in\n\n  the vehicle were owned by him, then my wife would be in trouble.": "andIf Ive admitted that all the things belonged to me, then Tan Jek Cheng would\n\n  admit that the thing found in the van belongs to him, and my wife would be out of trouble.29. In cross-examination the accused said that as he and Tan were sharing the\n\ndrugs equally, Tan was to pay for his share by making weekly payments of $300-$400 after making the\n\ninitial contribution of $1000. His intention was to sell half of his share of the drugs and to keep\n\nthe other half of his share for consumption. However, his stance on this was not consistent. He also\n\nsaid in evidence that his share was for his own consumption, and that the drugs were bought for\n\nconsumption by him and Tan.30. That was not all, his evidence on his rate of consumption also varied\n\nsubstantially. It varied from a straw or slightly more a day to half a sachet to a day to five\n\nsachets a week and half a pound in 30 days. (That would be at least one sachet a day on the basis of\n\nhis admission that he had filled about 60 sachets with the pound of heroin he bought, not counting\n\nthe loose pile still to be packed.) There were no medical records of drug withdrawal symptoms during\n\nthe time he was warded at the Tan Tock Seng Hospital from 27 to 29 January, and he did not say that\n\nhe developed such symptoms.31. Towards the end of his testimony, he said that he had told the recording\n\nofficer on 9 February that only half of the drugs purchased belonged to him, and that he intended to\n\nsell half of his share and consume the balance. This was a new development in that it was not put to\n\nASP Tan or the interpreter who assisted in the recording of the statement, as well as being\n\ninconsistent with the confirmation at the end of that statement that it was read over to and\n\naffirmed by him before he signed it.32. The prosecutor brought up his cautioned statement -Q (T)ake the statement at page 123 (the cautioned statement), when you gave\n\n  this statement, how do you know that Tan Jek Cheng would admit to the drugs in the van?A The CNB officers told me that Tan Jek Cheng had already admitted ownership of\n\n  the drugs found in the van.33. The accused went on to explain that \"(o)nce Tan Jek Cheng had admitted\n\nthe ownership of the drugs found in the van and I had admitted the ownership of the drugs found in\n\nthe flat, then my wife will have nothing to do with the drugs\", and this led toQ: (S)ince Tan had already admitted to the drugs in the van, your wife is\n\n  exonerated for the van drugs. Why didnt you say in the statement at page 123 (the cautioned\n\n  statement) that Tan had a share in it too  the flat drugs?A I wanted to make sure that my wife is really out of trouble; that I wanted to\n\n  make sure that she would be released before I mention that Ah Jack had a share in the drugs.34. Later in his evidence, he changed his position. He said he did not know of\n\nTans admission till the second or third occasion he made his statements.35. The prosecutor asked why he did not mention in his statement that Tan was\n\nwith him at the flat before he went to fetch his wife and grandson, and his explanation was that\n\nalthough Tan was at the flat with him between 3 pm and 4 pm and only left at 5 pm, he was too\n\nnervous to mention that when he made the statement. The explanation was in conflict with his\n\nstatement in which he admitted that he reached the flat at about 5 pm (not 3-4 pm), and instructed\n\nTan to fetch his wife and grandson while he went back to (not remained at) the flat. The\n\ndiscrepancies cannot be explained away as the result of nervousness or oversight.Evaluation of the defence36. The accused did not say that he was threatened or that any inducement was\n\noffered to him when he made the four statements to ASP Tan. The late allegation that his statement\n\nwas not fully or properly recorded was not credible because that was not put to ASP Tan or the\n\ninterpreter, and because the statements were read back to him and he had affirmed them to be true\n\nand correct.37. I also did not accept his explanation that he made the admission to secure\n\nhis wifes release. There was no basis for him to fear that Tan would allege that the drugs in the\n\nvan were hers. To the contrary, he knew that Tan had admitted the ownership of those drugs even\n\nbefore he made the first statement (although he shifted position on this later, as he did in other\n\naspects of his case).38. Even if he was moved to do that, there was no reason for him to admit sole\n\nownership of the drugs in the flat if that were not so. He could state the truth (or what he claimed\n\nto be the truth), that the drugs belonged to him and Tan, and that would still exonerate his wife.\n\nThere was absolutely no need for him to say they were all his.39. His defence was weak and flawed because -(i) his counsel did not put to Tan his alleged half share of the drugs and the\n\n  agreement to pay for it,(ii) his evidence that Tan was in the flat with him on 27 January was\n\n  contradicted by his own statement,(iii) his evidence on the intended use of the drugs was inconsistent,(iv) his evidence on his consumption rate varied substantially,and most importantly,(v) he admitted guilt in his voluntary statements in the clearest terms.40. After reviewing the evidence I found that the defence failed to raise any\n\nreasonable doubt that the accused was guilty and had admitted to the charge he faced. In coming to\n\nthis conclusion, I accepted that he may have consumed some of the heroin himself or with Tan if he\n\nwas not arrested, seeing that they were both heroin abusers, but it was clear from his admissions\n\nthat the principal purpose for acquiring the pound of heroin was for re-sale, and that any part of\n\nthat which would have been consumed by him would be insignificant in relation to the large quantity\n\nhe purchased. Furthermore, there was no reliable evidence for a meaningful apportionment of the\n\namount of the diamorphine for self-consumption (seeAbdul Karim bin Mohd v PP[1996] 1 SLR 1). Hence I convicted the accused and imposed the mandatory sentence of death on him.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright Â© Government of Singapore."
