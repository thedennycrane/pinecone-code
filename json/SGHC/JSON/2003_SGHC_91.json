        "Events after the confiscation": "26        On the day the “Ocean Opal” and the cargo were detained by the Chinese Customs, Mr Lim informed Mr Wu and Mr Goh about the detention. They later requested Mr Lim to assist the plaintiffs to get the cargo released by the Chinese customs. Mr Ng Hoi Shuen (“Mr Ng”), Managing Director of the plaintiffs, contacted Mr Lim for the first time over the transaction. Mr Ng said that the plaintiffs were prepared to bear the expenses. For reasons best known to the plaintiffs and the persons associated with them, they did not want to deal directly with the Customs authorities. The plaintiffs directed the defendants what representations to make. For e.g.  to explain to the Customs authorities the transfer of 4,760 MT of the cargo from “Ocean Opal” to “Min Hai You No. 5”, a contract for the sale of this quantity was drawn up solely for the purpose of making representations to the Customs.27        The defendants failed to persuade the Chinese Customs to release the cargo. On 21 August 1999 the Chinese Customs issued a Notice of Penalty Decision confiscating the cargo on board the “Ocean Opal” and the “Min Hai You No. 5”. The decision to confiscate was based on the fact that the description of the cargo in the shipping documents, i.e. LSWR was inconsistent with the nature of the cargo and therefore the cargo was without proper legal certification.28        At the request of the plaintiffs, the defendants instructed Chinese solicitors to apply to the Chinese courts for a review of the decision of the Chinese Customs to confiscate the cargo. The decision of the Chinese Customs to confiscate the cargo was upheld by the Guangdong Province Zhuhai City Intermediate Court which confirmed that by reason of the mis-description the cargo was without legal certificates under PRC law. The defendants unsuccessfully appealed to the Higher People’s Court of Guangdong Province. The highest provincial court also ruled that the description of the goods as LSWR in the shipping documents was inaccurate and inconsistent with the nature of the cargo and that the cargo was therefore without legal certificates under PRC law. If the cargo which is bound for discharge in any PRC port had been accurately described as VGO, the cargo after the STS transfer would have been permitted to proceed to Xiamen where the receivers of the cargo or the plaintiffs would produce the necessary Customs clearance and take the cargo out of the port.29        Financial liabilities were incurred as a result of the detention of the vessel. Arising from the erroneous description of the cargo, “Ocean Opal” was detained by the PRC Customs for a period of 64 days from 18 June 1999 to 21 August 1999. Ocean Tankers, on behalf of Nan Fang Maritime Pte Ltd (“Nan Fang”), claimed against the defendants for demurrage and/or damages for detention of the vessel in the sum of USD608,000.00 based on the demurrage rate of USD9,500 per day or pro rata as provided for in the charterparty in respect of “Ocean Opal”.30        According to evidence led by the defendants “Ocean Opal” suffered a leak in her stern tube though damage to the seal of the stem tube. The damaged seal of the stern tube was repaired after the vessel returned to Singapore following her release from detention. As a result of the leaking stern tube, the “Ocean Opal” suffered additional time loss due to her slow speed in her journey back to Singapore. The time loss amounted to USD90,808.12. The owners claimed against the defendants who quite properly paid the claim.31        A surveyor from SGS Hong Kong Ltd was on board when the ‘Ocean Opal’ was detained. The surveyor had to be transported back to Hong Kong from the PRC. The owners of ‘Ocean Opal’ through their agents Jardin Agencies (H.K.) hired a tug from South China Towing Co. Ltd to transport the surveyor. The whole exercise cost HKD52,920.00. Ocean Tankers on behalf of Nan Fang claimed against the defendants for the said sum which was duly paid by the defendants.32        The plaintiffs claim is for breach of the contract of sale. They assert that the defendants failed to deliver 18,489 MT of the cargo. They also make the same claim under the storage agreement and they claim that the defendants as a bailee had failed to take reasonable care of the cargo. The plaintiffs asserted that the delivery of the cargo should have taken place within “OPL Hong Kong” as they had instructed and that position for the ship to ship transfer refers to the body of water which is north of the Hong Kong boundary waters, i.e. within the territorial waters of Hong Kong. To support their claims, the plaintiffs also claimed that the cargo that was delivered did not contain either VGO or LSWR, but rather ‘fuel oil containing 60% of light diesel oil”. They further point to the fact, as recited earlier, that tanks 3s and 3p of ‘Ocean Opal’ contained 1,224 MT of diesel oil. They therefore seek the further remedy of asking from the defendants an indemnity for any demurrage or detention that they may be liable to pay the owners of “Min Hai You No. 5” for 47 days by the Gongbei Customs.33        On the other hand the defendants’ counterclaim is for the sum of USD698,808.13 and HKD136,837.76 or, alternatively, damages. The defendants’ counterclaims are based on the letters of indemnity given by the plaintiffs dated 20 May 1999 and 8 June 1999 in consideration of their instructions to change the name of cargo in the shipping documents from VGO to LSWR as well as the plaintiffs’ implied obligation at law to indemnify the defendants in acceding to their instructions.34        After the close of submissions it became clear that the plaintiffs did not deal with their claim for breach of contract of sale.35        However, for the first time in these proceedings the plaintiffs assert in their closing submissions at paras 5, 6, 15 and 23, that there wasnocontract of 17 May 1999 between them and the defendants. They submit that the ‘plaintiffs’ contractual relationship with the defendants only commenced with the contract dated 10 June 1999’. In my view this submission is inconsistent with the plaintiffs’ case and the evidence given by the managing director of the plaintiffs, Mr Ng.36        I refer to the plaintiffs’ pleaded case. By paragraph 1 of the further amended statement of claim of 12 April 2002 the plaintiffs referred to the ‘contract in writing dated 17thday of May 1999, bearing the defendants’ contract reference number ‘95/05/0k/s5296-00’ and”entered into between the plaintiffs and the defendants”(emphasis added). Later in paragraph 6 the plaintiffs asserts that defendants had breach the contract of 17 May 1999.  In paragraph 2(c) of their reply the plaintiffs aver that “at all times the defendants dealt only with the plaintiffs, and not with Sinocean, in all matters pertaining to the cargo and the plaintiffs were advised and guided by the defendants with regard to the same as stated below.” It is clear from the plaintiffs’ own case that their dealings with the defendants commenced from the outset of the transaction, i.e. in May 1999. They are not permitted to assert a case inconsistent with their pleadings: seeMulti-Pak Singapore Pte Ltd v Intraco Ltd[1992] 2 SLR 793,Kiaw Aik Hang v Tan Tien Choy(1964) 30 MLJ 99, 101 andEsso Petroleum Co Ltd v Southport Corporation[1956] H.L.(E.) 218, 237, 243.37        An analysis of Mr Ng’s evidence confirm the following facts. The plaintiffs treated themselves as the buyers of the cargo. Sinocean was merely their nominee from the outset in mid May 1999; certainly the outset was not from 10 June 1999. He agreed in cross examination that the plaintiffs had received the first two lots in late May, 1999 and early June 1999 of the cargo without any complaints about the quality or specifications. Further, on the plaintiffs’ own evidence it was clear that they had in May 1999 sold the cargo to Nanan Xinjinjiang, PRC. Mr Goh, the general manager of the plaintiffs, made the glib claim in cross examination that there was no contract as at 17 May 1999 between the plaintiffs and the defendants. His evidence is not borne out by the documentary evidence led in court. Those correspondence after 17 May 1999 either referred to or implicitly acknowledged the existence of the contract. In my judgment it is quite clear that the plaintiffs had from the outset regarded themselves as the buyer of the cargo and Sinocean was in fact their nominee. It is not permissible for the plaintiffs to turn around now during the closing submissions and claim that prior to 10 June 1999 they had no contractual relationship with the defendants.38        In my view this submission is a last-ditch attempt to avoid the plaintiffs’ obligations under the letters of indemnity of 25 May 1999 and 8 June 1999 and to get round the fact that the instructions to change the name of the cargo came from the plaintiffs themselves, who must bear the consequences.39        By paragraph 6 of their closing submissions the plaintiffs assert a novation of the contract of 17 May 1999. They go on to say that the contract of 17 May 1999 was extinguished by reason of the novation and it was replaced with the contract of 10 June 1999. For a start, it should be noted that the plaintiffs did not plead novation. In my judgment, there was no novation. There was no evidence of any intention to novate on the part of all three parties, namely, the plaintiffs, the defendants and Sinocean, which was emphasised inThe Tychy (No. 2)[2001] 1  Lloyd’s Law Rep 10, 24. The relevant principles on novation were summarised thus:“(a)  Novation involves the creation of a new contract where an existing party is replaced by a new party.  (b)  Thus, novation requires the consent of all parties, including in particular the party which is thereby accepting a new person as his debtor or as his counterpart under an executory contract.  (c)  The consent may be apparent from express words or inferred from conduct.  (d)  The consent must be clearly established on the evidence as being only consistent with the intent of achieving a novation: seeIn re European Assurance Society,(1875) 1 Ch. D. 34;Lorentzen v. White Shipping Co. Ltd.,(1942) 74 Ll. L. Rep. 161 andLindern Trawler Managers Ltd. v. W.H.J. Trawlers,(1950) 83 Ll. L. Rep. 131.”40        What had happened was this. The rights, liabilities and obligations arising in connection with the contract of 17 May 1999 as well as the shipments thereunder weretransferredfrom Sinocean to the plaintiffs. The contract of 10 June 1999 carried the reference 99/05/ok/85296-00(assign) (emphasis added). By paragraph 5 of his own affidavit evidence in chief, Mr Ng deposed of an assignment of rights and benefits. Significantly, the notice of assignment related to atransfer of “all liabilities and obligations of all the shipments including but not limited to those shipments that were delivered prior to the assignment…”.In my judgment, the assignment formalised what the parties had intended from the outset, which was that it was the plaintiffs who was in fact and in truth the buyer of the cargo to be shipped in 3 lots to Xiamen.41        By way of reply against the case of the defendants the plaintiffs make the following submissions. First, they say the changing of he name of the cargo in the shipping documents from VGO to LSWR was to avoid the possibility of the PRC Customs mistaking the alphabets ‘GO’ in VGO to mean gas oil. This argument is without any support on the evidence. Secondly, the change of name was a matter between Sinocean and the defendants only and it was the plaintiffs’ buyers, Nanan Xinjinjiang who requested for the change of the name of the cargo. On the evidence, the explanation is simply not so innocent. As noted earlier, Mr Ng agreed in cross examination that it was the plaintiffs who requested the defendants to change the name of VGO to LSWR. The change in name was clearly to import the cargo without permit and to get round the quota imposed by the PRC.42        Thirdly, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants have not adduced any evidence to show that VGO contains 60% light diesel oil. Apart from the questionable relevance of the point, this submission ignores the evidence of Mr Ray Hogger, the expert who gave evidence for the defendants. He concluded that the contractual specifications of the cargo are more consistent with the typical properties and specifications of VGO, as opposed to LSWR, in terms of viscosity, pour point, sulphur content, metals content and distillation date. He expressed the view that it would be inappropriate to describe the cargo as LSWR as its sulphur content was too high. The cargo was essentially a distillate, as opposed to a residue. VGO is a distillate whereas LSWR, by definition, is a residue. Mr Hogger explained why the cargo was VGO. He considered the Zhuhai report produced by the Gongbei Customs. Mr Hogger said that “the samples tested by Zhuhai inspection bureau are one and the same product as the cargo sold by the defendants to the plaintiffs,” having noted that “the analytical results stated in the Zhuhai report are essentially the same as the specifications and the saybolt/sgs results.” The latter two documents related to the cargo in question.",
        "Conclusions": "43        The key to the resolution of the disputes in this case lies in the answer to the question as to the effective and proximate cause of the confiscation of the cargo by the Gongbei Customs. on the question what is the legal causation, Chitty on Contract Vol 1, 28thedn at para 27-024 stated:“the claimant may recover damages for a loss  only where the breach of contract was the “effective” or “dominant” cause of  that loss the courts have avoided laying down any formal tests for causation: they have relied on common sense to guide decisions as to whether a breach of contract is a sufficiently substantial cause of the claimant’s loss.”44        The plaintiffs also based their claims under the storage agreement of 14 June 1999. They assert that it is for the defendants to show that the loss of the third lot of the cargo did not result from their negligence. Under this head of claim, the defendants again take the position that the confiscation of the cargo was caused by the plaintiffs’ change of name of the cargo from VGO to LSWR. But for the change of the name of the cargo, the confiscation of the cargo would not have happened. In my judgment the evidence support this submission. Without the erroneous naming of the cargo by the plaintiffs the offence under article 4(2) of the implementation rules could not have been committed even if there was a ship to ship transfer within PRC waters. Neither the decisions of the Gongbei Customs nor the two judgments of the Chinese courts was it stated that the ship to ship transfer was the basis of the confiscation.45        On any view of the evidence, it is also clear beyond dispute that both the plaintiffs and the defendants agreed to take the third lot of the cargo from Hong Kong, OPL. This much was admitted by the plaintiffs general manager, Mr Goh, in his cross examination. The vessel’s nautical position at Hong Kong, OPL was 22° 08’ N, 114°08’ E at which the ship to ship transfer was to take place. When advised of the nautical position, the plaintiffs, their employees and agents accepted it for the ship to ship transfer without any modification or reservation. The plaintiffs instructed their chartered vessel, “Min Hai You No. 5” to proceed to that position for the ship to ship transfer. The plaintiffs seek to show that they had intended to take delivery of the third lot of the cargo in small lots within Hong Kong territorial waters. There is, in my view, no substance to this assertion. Nor was it possible because the Hong Kong Marine Department made it abundantly clear that ‘transfer of petroleum cargo in bulk between ships is not permitted within Hong Kong waters due to port safety, weather and environment factors.’ Indeed, Captain Peter Chu Chi Tung, a master mariner and an experienced Hong Kong port pilot, told the court that he had never superintended, or seen or heard of a STS transfer of petroleum products in bulk within Hong Kong waters. I reject the evidence led by the plaintiffs through their expert, Mr Sherman Yan, who attempted to say that STS transfer of petroleum in bulk was possible at the dangerous goods anchorages, especially the south Lamma Dangerous Goods Anchorage. In my view and I agree with the defendants’ contrary evidence that such STS transfer would increase the dangers manifold and would not be permitted by the port authority of Hong Kong.46       Accordingly, the plaintiffs’ claims are wholly without merit and are dismissed with costs. They caused the confiscation and loss of the third lot of the cargo by their mis-description of the cargo as LSWR when it was VGO. It follows that the defendants’ counterclaims are allowed with costs.Plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed with costs.Defendants’ counterclaims are allowed with costs.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
