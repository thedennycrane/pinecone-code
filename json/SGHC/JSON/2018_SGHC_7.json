        "The parties": "2 The plaintiff and the defendant are brothers. The latter is the majority shareholder of Tat Leong Investment Pte Ltd (“TLI”), which owns 50.35% of Tat Leong Development (Pte) Ltd (“TLD”), and Tat Leong Petroleum Co (Pte) Ltd (“TLP”). The plaintiff is a minority shareholder in TLI, TLD and TLP (“the Tat Leong Companies”).",
        "Background to the dispute": "Events leading up to the Settlement Agreement 3 On 13 November 2014, the plaintiff applied to the court by way of Companies Winding Up Nos 226, 227 and 228 of 2014 for an order that the Tat Leong Companies be wound up under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Companies Act”),ie, on the basis that it was just and equitable to do so: seeLin Choo Mee v Tat Leong Development (Pte) Ltd and Others and Other Matters[2015] SGHC 99 (“the Judgment”) at [26]. The plaintiff arguedinter aliathat the relationship of mutual trust and confidence between himself and the defendant had broken down; and that he had been wrongfully excluded from participating in the management of the Tat Leong Companies: see the Judgment at [26(a)]–[26(b)] and [72]. 4 On 13 April 2015, Steven Chong J (as he then was) (“Chong J”) found that a relationship of mutual trust and confidence was central to the existence of the Tat Leong Companies,ie, they were quasi-partnerships; and the relationship of trust and confidence as between the parties had disintegrated (the Judgment at [75] and [77]). Chong J also found that the plaintiff had been deliberately excluded from the management of TLD and TLI, in breach of an understanding that he was to have a management role in both companies (the Judgment at [81]). At the time of the Judgment, a court did not have the power to order a buy-out of shares, in lieu of winding up the company, on an application under s 254(1)(i) of the Companies Act. Chong J accordingly ordered that the Tat Leong Companies be wound up, although he deferred the winding-up orders for 30 days to allow the parties to reach an amicable settlement in line with the approach taken by the Court of Appeal inSim Yong Kim v Evenstar Investments Pte Ltd[2006] 3 SLR(R) 827. Chong J also ordered the defendant to pay costs fixed at $40,000 excluding disbursements to the plaintiff, with such costs and disbursements to be reflected solely against the value of the defendant’s shares in the Tat Leong Companies (“the Costs Order”). 5 The parties were unable to settle the dispute within 30 days. The defendant appealed against Chong J’s decision in Civil Appeals Nos 101, 102 and 103 of 2015 (“the Appeals”). Pending the Appeals, the defendant applied for a stay of Chong J’s orders. On 23 June 2015, Hoo Sheau Peng JC (as she then was) (“Hoo JC”) granted a stay of Chong J’s orders. 6 On 23 November 2015, at the hearing of the Appeals, the Court of Appeal suggested that the parties attend mediation to resolve their differences. 7 On 28 December 2015, the parties attended mediation and entered into the Settlement Agreement at the conclusion of the mediation. The Settlement Agreement 8 The Settlement Agreement provided for the defendant to purchase the plaintiff’s shares in the Tat Leong Companies for a sum of money to be determined under the terms of the Settlement Agreement (“the Consideration”). The following terms of the Settlement Agreement were material in this case. 9 Clause 3 of the Settlement Agreement provided as follows: 3. The consideration for [the plaintiff’s] shareholding in the three companies shall bethe aggregate of the following: (a) in relation to the shareholding in [TLD] and [TLI] the consideration shall be 23.44% of the net tangible asset value of [TLD]; and (b) in relation to the shareholding in [TLP], 14.81% of the net tangible asset value of [TLP]. [emphasis added] 10 Clauses 4 to 8 provided for the calculation of the net tangible asset value (“NTAV”) of TLD and TLP. Notably, cl 5 provided as follows: The [NTAV] of [TLP] shall be [$279,990 - $511,320 +the Sale Price of#03-11, Far East Plaza, 14 Scotts Road]. [emphasis added] Clause 5 thus set out a formula for determining the NTAV of TLP which referred to the sale price of #03-11, Far East Plaza (“the Far East Plaza Unit”). The Settlement Agreement therefore envisioned that TLP’s NTAV, and hence, in turn, the total sum of the Consideration under cl 3, would only be determined once the Far East Plaza Unit had been sold. The difficulties in the sale of this property are the principal source of this dispute. 11 Clause 9 provided for Colliers International Singapore (“Colliers”) to be appointed as the agent for the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit. 12 Clause 10 addressed the implementation of the Settlement Agreement. Clauses 10(b) and 10(c), which are of central importance in this case, stated: 10. This agreement shall be implemented as follows: … (b) The agent for the sale of [the Far East Plaza Unit] will be appointed within 14 days of the date hereof. …The sale of the said property is to be completed within six months hereof. (c) The payment of the consideration to [the plaintiff]shall be made, whether by way of transfer of his shareholding or by capital reduction …within 9 months hereof or within 1 month of the completion of sale of both 27 Jalan Rimau and [the Far East Plaza Unit], whichever is earlier. … [emphasis added] 13 Under cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff and his family were to move out of 27 Jalan Rimau, their home of 25 years, within one month after Colliers provided a valuation of 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau. 25 and 27 Jalan Rimau were family properties owned by TLD. 14 Clause 12 stated that “[the defendant] agrees and will procure that the [Tat Leong Companies] will not deal with their assets or take on any further liabilitiessave as in the ordinary course of business… [emphasis added]”. It further provided that the defendant would procure his solicitors “to hold the net sale proceeds of [the Far East Plaza Unit and 27 Jalan Rimau] as stakeholders until [the plaintiff] is paid his consideration in full…”. 15 Clause 13 provided that the parties would not have claims against each other “in relation to any matter arising from or connected to the subject matter of [the Appeals],save for any costs orders already made[emphasis added]”. 16 Clause 14 provided that the parties would refer “any dispute arising from the implementation of [the Settlement Agreement]” to the mediator who had conduct of the mediation on 28 December 2015 (“the Mediator”). Events after the Settlement Agreement 17 Between January and March 2016, the Far East Plaza Unit was marketed for sale in the open market. However, no offers were made for the Far East Plaza Unit during this period. 18 On 30 March 2016, in accordance with cl 11 of the Settlement Agreement, the plaintiff and his family moved out of 27 Jalan Rimau. 19 The parties subsequently agreed to auction the Far East Plaza Unit in April and May 2016 at a reserve price of $2.2m. This reserve price was based on an indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit at $2.1–$2.2m, which Colliers provided on 29 March 2016. Auctions were held on 20 April and 26 May 2016 but both were unsuccessful. No bid was made at the auctions for the Far East Plaza Unit at the opening price of $2.2m. 20 By a letter dated 5 July 2016, the plaintiff made several proposals to the defendant. It should be noted that by this time, the six-month period for the completion of the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit stipulated in cl 10(b) of the Settlement Agreement had expired on 28 June 2016. The plaintiff proposed that Colliers be discharged as the agent for the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit and another firm appointed to perform an independent valuation of the property; and, in the alternative, that the NTAV of TLP be assessed based on Colliers’ indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit. 21 By a letter dated 8 July 2016, the defendant’s solicitors replied stating that the defendant did not agree to the plaintiff’s proposals in his letter of 5 July 2016. The defendant counter-proposed that the parties auction the Far East Plaza Unit in July 2016 at the slightly reduced reserve price of $2.1m. 22 By a letter dated 12 July 2016, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the Mediator stating that a dispute between the parties had arisen from the implementation of the Settlement Agreement; and, requested that the dispute be referred to the Mediator pursuant to cl 14 of the Settlement Agreement (see [16] above). A mediation session was fixed for 9 September 2016. However, this was cancelled on 7 September 2016 because the Mediator fell ill. 23 By a letter dated 19 September 2016 from his solicitors, the plaintiff requested the defendant to pay him the sum of $1,104,072.05, in exchange for the plaintiff’s shares in TLI. This figure was arrived at by applying the formula for calculating the NTAV of TLD set out in cll 4, 6, 7 and 8 of the Settlement Agreement, excluding one component of the formula (the value of two Chinese subsidiaries of TLD) that was disputed at the time. Notably, the plaintiff’s request was made on the basis that the Consideration was severable into (1) the sum due under cl 3(a), for his shares in TLI and TLD and (2) the sum due under cl 3(b), for his shares in TLP (see [9] above). 24 By a letter from his solicitors dated 22 September 2016, the defendant replied to the plaintiff’s letter dated 19 September 2016 stating that he did not agree to the plaintiff’s proposal therein. The defendant asserted that the Settlement Agreement did not provide for part-payment of the Consideration; and that the plaintiff’s failure to reply to his proposal in the 8 July 2016 letter, to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $2.1m, had held up the sale process and delayed the conclusion of the Settlement Agreement. 25 By a letter dated 4 October 2016, the plaintiff’s solicitors demanded that the defendant complete the transfer of the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI for the sum of $1,152,486.35. It was undisputed in this suit that this sum reflects 23.44% of TLD’s NTAV as determined under the Settlement Agreement; and was to be paid for the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI under cl 3(a) of the Settlement Agreement (see [9] above), albeit the defendant’s position was that the Settlement Agreement provided for payment of the Consideration as one lump sum and did not provide for part-payment of the same (see [39(a)] below). The letter also indicated that the plaintiff was agreeable to auctioning the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $2.1m, but only until 31 December 2016. If the property was not sold by then, the plaintiff proposed assessing the NTAV of TLP based on the reserve price of $2.1m. 26 By a letter from his solicitors dated 6 October 2016, the defendant maintained that he was not obliged to make part-payment of the Consideration. He also stated that he would make the necessary arrangements for the Far East Plaza Unit to be auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m. He did not agree to the use of the reserve price to determine the NTAV of TLP in the event that the further auctions of the Far East Plaza Unit were unsuccessful. 27 On 17 October 2016, the plaintiff commenced this suit. 28 On 27 October 2016, 24 November 2016 and 15 December 2016, the Far East Plaza Unit was auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m. Again, no bids were made at any of the auctions for the property at the opening price of $2.1m. 29 By a letter from his solicitors dated 10 January 2017, the plaintiff proposed lowering the reserve price for the Far East Plaza Unit at auction to $1.5m; and stated that he would be willing to consider a bid below $1.5m. The defendant rejected this proposal by a letter dated 11 January 2017 from his solicitors, proposing to retain the reserve price at $2.1m. The defendant reaffirmed his proposal to retain the reserve price at $2.1m after a further letter from the plaintiff’s solicitors regarding the reserve price. 30 On 19 January 2017, the Far East Plaza Unit was again auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m; and yet again, no bid was made for the property. 31 On 20 January 2017, an offer was made for the Far East Plaza Unit at the price of $1.1m (after an earlier offer on the same day at the price of $1m). This appeared to be the only offer the property had received. 32 On 3 February 2017, Chong J heard an application by the plaintiff for partial summary judgment,viz, for an order that the defendant complete the disposal of the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI for the sum of $1,152,486.35 (see [25] above). Chong J dismissed the plaintiff’s application. 33 By a letter dated 15 February 2017, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to Colliers requesting,inter alia, a fresh indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit and a recommendation on a reserve price for the sale of the property at auction. 34 By an email dated 16 February 2017, Colliers wrote to the defendant’s solicitors stating that the indicative valuation of the Far East Plaza Unit was $2–$2.2m, and recommended a reserve price of $1.6m. The defendant’s solicitors forwarded this email to the plaintiff’s solicitors on 23 February 2017. In the interim, by a letter dated 17 February 2017, the plaintiff’s solicitors wrote to the defendant’s solicitors asserting that the defendant was “deliberately stalling the sale of the property” and stated that the plaintiff would inform Colliers to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $1.1m. On the same day, the plaintiff purported to instruct Colliers by letter to auction the Far East Plaza Unit at the reserve price of $1.1m. However, the defendant objected to this and the property was placed for auction at the reserve price of $2.1m on 22 February 2017. Again, there was no bid at the opening price of $2.1m. 35 On 27 April, 25 May, 21 June and 27 July 2017, the Far East Plaza Unit was again auctioned at the reserve price of $2.1m; and, once again, there was no opening bid for the property at any of these auctions at the opening price. In fact, no bids at all were received for the property.",
        "The parties’ cases": "36 The parties agreed that the Settlement Agreement contained two implied terms: (1) a term that the parties should “take reasonable endeavours and/or do all that may be necessary to give effect to the spirit and intent of the Settlement Agreement and to implement the terms of the Settlement Agreement” (“the Reasonable Endeavours Term”); and (2) a term that “the sale price of the Far East Plaza Unit shall be reasonable” (“the Reasonable Price Term”). 37 The plaintiff’s case was as follows: (a) First, the defendant breached cl 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement and the Reasonable Endeavours Term by failing to complete the disposal of the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI and to pay the sum of $1,152,486.35 to the plaintiff within nine months of the date of the Settlement Agreement,ie, 28 September 2015. (b) Secondly, the defendant breached cll 5, 10(b) and 10(c) and the Reasonable Endeavours Term in failing to take reasonable steps to conclude the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit within six months from the date of the Settlement Agreement,ie, 28 June 2016, or thereafter. (c) Thirdly, the defendant breached cl 12 of the Settlement Agreement by causing TLD to transfer $150,000 to Tat Leong Travel Pte Ltd (“TLT”). This transaction was outside of TLD’s ordinary course of business. (d) Fourthly, the defendant breached cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement by failing to satisfy the Costs Order. 38 The plaintiff averred that the defendant’s breaches of the Settlement Agreement caused him loss. He sought orders that the defendant complete the disposal of (1) his shares in TLD and TLI, for the sum of $1,152,486.35 and (2) his shares in TLP, for such sum as the court determined; and, alternatively, for damages to be assessed. He also sought injunctions to restrain the defendant from dealing with or disposing of the assets of the Tat Leong Companies and/or taking on further liabilities of the said companies save in the ordinary course of business, pending completion of the disposal of the plaintiff’s shares. Further, he sought the sum of $40,000 plus disbursements in respect of the Costs Order. 39 The defendant denied breaching the Settlement Agreement and averred the following in response to the plaintiff’s allegations: (a) First, he did not breach the Settlement Agreement by failing to complete the disposal of the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI specifically, because the Settlement Agreement did not provide for part-payment of the Consideration. He was not required to purchase the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI when the Far East Plaza Unit had not been sold. (b) Secondly, he had taken all reasonable steps to conclude the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit. (c) Thirdly, he funded the transfer of the $150,000 from TLD to TLT,ie, the money came from his personal funds; and the transfer was made to meet a requirement of the Singapore Tourism Board (“the STB”) that TLT had to maintain a minimum paid-up capital of $100,000. (d) Finally, cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement only preserved the plaintiff’s right to payment for any costs orders made in the Appeals and there were no such costs orders. Clause 13 did not preserve the plaintiff’s right to payment in respect of the Costs Order.",
        "The issues": "40 The following issues fell to be determined: (a) First, did the Settlement Agreement provide for part-payment of the Consideration (such that the defendant was required to complete the disposal of the plaintiff’s shares in TLD and TLI, even if the NTAV of TLP was undetermined because the Far East Plaza Unit had not been sold) (“Issue 1”)? (b) Secondly, did the defendant breach the Settlement Agreement by failing to (take reasonable steps to) sell the Far East Plaza Unit (“Issue 2”)? (c) Thirdly, did the defendant breach the Settlement Agreement by causing TLD to transfer $150,000 to TLT (“Issue 3”)? (d) Finally, did the defendant breach the Settlement Agreement by failing to pay the Costs Order (“Issue 4”)? I addressed Issues 1 to 4 in turn.",
        "Issue 1: The severability of the Consideration": "",
        "The parties’ submissions": "62 The plaintiff submitted that the Carve-Out preserved his right to the costs of the winding-up applications. At the time of the Settlement Agreement, there were no other costs order apart from the Costs Order and accordingly the Carve-Out had to refer to the Costs Order. 63 The defendant submitted that the Carve-Out would only have referred to costs orders made in the Appeals. However, no such costs orders were made. Accordingly, no costs were payable to the plaintiff under cl 13.",
        "My decision": "64  I found that the Carve-Out referred to the Costs Order, for two reasons: (a) First, the Costs Order plainly fell within the scope of the Carve-Out as it was “already made” by the time of the Settlement Agreement and was connected with the subject matter of the Appeals, which were the winding-up orders. (b) Secondly, I did not accept that the Carve-Out could only refer to costs orders made in the Appeals. I should note that it was initially not very clear what the defendant’s case on the Carve-Out was, because the defendant suggested in written closing submissions that the Carve-Out could have referred to cost orders made by Hoo JC, in dismissing the plaintiff’s application to discharge Hoo JC’s earlier orders for a stay of execution pending appeal (see [5] above). Nonetheless, counsel for the defendant, Ms Hui Choon Wai (“Ms Hui”), clarified during oral closing submissions that it was not her case that the Carve-Out referred to those costs. Her case was simply that cl 13 superseded the orders made in the winding-up applications, including the Costs Order. I did not accept this submission for two reasons: (i)  First, the defendant’s interpretation of cl 13 would have rendered the clause otiose because no costs orders were made in the Appeals. The parties would have known this when they entered into the Settlement Agreement. (ii) Secondly, cl 1(b) of the Settlement Agreement expressly provided that “each party shall bear their own costs of [the Appeals]”. In other words, the parties expressly dealt with the costs of the Appeals under cl 1(b). This indicated that they did not intend to refer to the same under cl 13. When I sought clarification from the defendant as to what costs the Carve-Out was intended to cover, he was unable to provide a cogent response. Instead, he suggested that the Costs Order only had to be paid if the Tat Leong Companies were liquidated and also stated that he had disagreed with the Costs Order and therefore appealed. The defendant did not give any explanation why the Carve-Out was included in cl 13. On the other hand, the plaintiff was clear and unequivocal that the Carve-Out was intended “[t]o cover my---the 40,000”. His position, when assessed against the objective facts, seemed to be true. 65 As noted at [37(d)] above, the plaintiff’s case was not merely that the Carve-Out referred to the Costs Order, but that the defendant breached cl 13 in failing to pay the Costs Order. After I delivered oral grounds on 29 September 2017, Mr Narayanan Sreenivasan, SC (“Mr Sreenivasan”), counsel for the plaintiff, drew my attention to the fact that the defendant did not plead in his defence that even if the Carve-Out referred to the Costs Order, he did not breach cl 13 because cl 13 did not create an independent obligation to pay the Costs Order. Ms Hui readily conceded this, adding that there was no defence that cl 13 did not impose an obligation to pay. She stated that the only defence was that the Carve-Out did not preserve the plaintiff’s right to claim the Costs Order,ie,that it did not apply to the Costs Order. I therefore made the further finding that the defendant had breached cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement in failing to pay the Costs Order.",
        "Issue 2: The failure to sell the Far East Plaza Unit": "",
        "Issue 3: The transfer of $150,000 to TLT": "",
        "Issue 4: The scope of cl 13": "61 As noted at [15] above, cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement provided that the parties would not have any claims against each other “in relation to any matter arising from or connected to the subject matter of [the Appeals],save for any costs orders already made” [emphasis added]. I shall refer to the italicised portion of cl 13 as “the Carve-Out”.",
        "The appropriate relief": "66 I then turned to the issue of the appropriate relief. Given my finding that the Consideration was not severable (see [45] above), I decided that it was not appropriate to award the plaintiff the separate relief, in respect of the shares in TLD and TLI and those in TLP, which the plaintiff claimed (see [38] above). 67 The present trial was not bifurcated. Yet the plaintiff did not lead any evidence as to the price at which the Far East Plaza Unit would have been sold if the defendant did not breach cl 10(b) of the Settlement Agreement. However, during oral closing submissions, Ms Hui rightly indicated that she would not be taking any objection concerning the lack of bifurcation if I concluded that the defendant was liable and ordered that damages be assessed separately. 68 I therefore entered judgment for the plaintiff with damages to be assessed for the defendant’s breach of cll 10(b) and 10(c) of the Settlement Agreement in failing to complete the sale of the Far East Plaza Unit by 28 June 2016 and to pay the Consideration to the plaintiff by 28 September 2016. 69 In view of my conclusion that the defendant did not breach cl 12, I was not inclined to grant the injunctions which the plaintiff sought (see [38] above). 70 In relation to the Costs Order, the plaintiff prayed for an order that the defendant pay the Costs Order. I was initially not inclined to make such an order because the Costs Order had already been made. It seemed that the plaintiff could simply seek enforcement of the same. However, after I delivered my oral grounds, Mr Sreenivasan, apart from making the point noted at [65] above, also pointed out that the Costs Order did not in fact direct payment in the usual way. It directed that the Costs Order was to be debited against the defendant’s shares in the Tat Leong Companies in their winding up (see [4] above). Hence, it was open to the plaintiff to enforce the Costs Order in the usual way. 71 As the Costs Order was for payment of the liquidated sum of $40,000 and disbursements to be agreed if not taxed, I did not think it was appropriate to enter judgment for a liquidated amount. I therefore varied my oral judgment to provide for interlocutory judgment for breach of cl 13 of the Settlement Agreement in failing to pay the sum provided for under the Costs Order. 72 Finally, on costs, while the defendant succeeded on some issues, the plaintiff succeeded on the main issue in this case,ie, whether the defendant breached his obligations under the Settlement Agreement by failing to sell the Far East Plaza Unit and pay the Consideration to the plaintiff. I therefore awarded 90% of the costs of the proceedings to the plaintiff on a standard basis.     Kannan RameshJudge  Narayanan Sreenivasan SC and Tan Kai Ning Claire (Straits Law Practice LLC) for the plaintiff;Hui Choon Wai and Ho Si Hui (Wee Swee Teow LLP) for the defendant."
