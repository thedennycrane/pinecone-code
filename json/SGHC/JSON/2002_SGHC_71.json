        "The claim": ".19.    Goh and Lee’s claim against Winjoy was based on cll 8(1) and\n\n11(3) of the S&P Agreement. It will be helpful to set the material provisions in cll 8\n\nand 11 in full:\"8. (1) The Vendor shall forthwith erectin a good and\n\n  workmanlike manner the building unitand the housing project together with all the\n\n  common property thereof in accordance with the specifications described in the Third\n\n  Schedule andin accordance with the plans approved by the Building Authority and other\n\n  authorities, which specifications and plans have been accepted and approved by the\n\n  Purchaser as the Purchaser hereby acknowledges.(2) No changes or deviations shall be made to the specifications and\n\n  plans except such changes or deviations as may be approved or required by the Building\n\n  Authority or other authorities.…11. (1) The Vendor shall complete the building unitso as to be fit\n\n  for occupationand remove all surplus material, plant and rubbish from the building\n\n  unit and the housing project anddeliver vacant possession of the building unit to the\n\n  Purchase on or before the 31stday of October 1998.(2) On delivery of vacant possession of the building unit to the\n\n  Purchaser, the Vendor shall deliver to the Purchaser or his solicitors a copy of the\n\n  temporary occupation permit or certificate of statutory completion for the occupation of\n\n  the building unit issued by the Building Authority together with the certificate of the\n\n  Vendor’s architect that the building unit and the housing project and all roads and\n\n  drainage and sewerage works of the housing project have been constructed in accordance\n\n  with the plans and specifications approved by the Building Authority and that water,\n\n  electricity and gas supplies have been duly connected to the building unit.(3)If the Vendor fails or is unable to deliver vacant possession of\n\n  the building unit to the Purchaser on the date specified in paragraph (1) for any\n\n  reason whatsoever, the Vendor shall pay to the Purchaser liquidated damagescalculated\n\n  from day to day at the rate of 10% per annum on the total sum of all the instalments paid\n\n  by the Purchaser towards the purchase price for the period commencing immediately after\n\n  the date specified in paragraph (1) and ending on the date vacant possession of the\n\n  building unit is delivered to the Purchaser.(4) … \"(Emphasis added.)It was Goh and Lee’s pleaded case that, in breach of cl 8, Winjoy\n\nhad built the unit so fundamentally and substantially different from the plans approved by\n\nthe Building Authority that the unit was not fit for occupation. It was alleged that as a\n\nresult the notice of 17 June 1998, to Goh and Lee, to take possession was not in\n\ncompliance with cl 11(1) and Winjoy could only be said to have delivered possession of the\n\nunit to Goh and Lee, on 21 August 1999 when Winjoy completed the remedial works and handed\n\nthe rear door key to Goh and Lee. Goh and Lee therefore claimed liquidated damages under\n\ncl 11(3) from Winjoy for the period 31 October 1998 to 21 August 1999.20.    In the alternative, Goh and Lee claimed that by reason of\n\nWinjoy’s breaches they were unable to rent out the unit from 2 July 1998 to 21 August\n\n1999 and thereby lost the profit they would otherwise have made if Winjoy had delivered\n\npossession of the property on 2 July 1998 in a condition that complied with the\n\nrequirements of the S&P Agreement.21.    The learned trial judge summarised the defences raised by Winjoy\n\nand the Reply of Goh and Lee as follows:\"The defence was twofold: (1) the defence pleaded that the\n\n  plaintiffs were aware of and approved of the post revision plan [Plan 2] although at\n\n  trial, the defence did not pitch its case as high and merely said that the plaintiffs knew\n\n  of the mistake in the plan; and (2) that it was pursuant to a settlement agreement entered\n\n  into in late January 1999, that Winjoy carried out the works and offered to reimburse\n\n  the plaintiffs for property tax and maintenance fees up to the completion of the works.\n\n  Alternatively, the plaintiffs were estopped from making the claim against Winjoy.In their reply, the plaintiffs denied knowledge of Plan 2\n\n  or of any mistake in the plans or the existence of any settlement agreement.\"In summarising of the defences the learned trial judge appears to have\n\nleft out two further defences raised:(a) That Winjoy had complied with cl 8 of the S&P Agreement. In the\n\n  event the court held otherwise, the remedy available to Goh and Lee is under cl 18(1)\n\n  of the S&P Agreement which remedy had already been accorded to Goh and Lee in that\n\n  Winjoy has made good the layout to the satisfaction of Goh and Lee; and(b) That Winjoy, in compliance with cl 11(1) of the S&P Agreement,\n\n  had delivered vacant possession of the completed unit – in a condition \"fit for\n\n  occupation\" – before 31 October 1998 as required under cl 11(1) and consequently\n\n  Goh and Lee could not claim liquidated damages under cl 11(3).I will first deal with the issue whether Goh and Lee were aware –\n\n  at the time they signed the option or at any time before they signed the S&P Agreement\n\n  – that two identical plans had been attached to the letter of consent by mistake.22.    On the issue of the \"mistake\" the learned trial judge\n\nheld that there was nothing \"bizarre or suspect\" in the explanation given by\n\nAlexia that the changes were marginal and, accordingly, it was reasonable for Goh and Lee\n\nto trust that explanation and sign the letter of consent. The learned trial judge went on\n\nto find that Winjoy was in breach of cl 8 of the S&P Agreement in not having built the\n\nunit in accordance with the layout plan (Plan 1) approved by Goh and Lee. She found\n\nthat Winjoy had not, by 31 October 1998, delivered a unit built in compliance with the\n\nS&P Agreement to Goh and Lee and that as a consequence liquidated damages under cl 11\n\nwas payable. She further found that Winjoy had handed possession of a unit that complied\n\nwith the S&P Agreement only on 21 August 1999 and ordered that liquidated damages\n\nunder cl 11(3) for the period 31 October 1998 to 21 August 1999 (less 33 days for delays\n\nattributable to Goh and Lee) be paid by Winjoy to Goh and Lee. In addition, she also\n\nordered that Winjoy pay the property tax and service charges in respect of the unit up to\n\n21 August 1999.",
        "The mistake": ".23.    Winjoy enclosed two plans to the letter of consent –\n\none marked \"Approved Plan\" (Plan 1) and the other marked\n\n\"Proposed Revision\" (the intended Plan 2) with a view to highlighting the\n\ndifferences in layout between Plan 1 and Plan 2 to the purchaser. However, the layout of\n\nthe two plans annexed to the letter of consent signed by Goh and Lee were identical. By no\n\nstretch of the imagination could two identical copies to reflect the \"general\n\nrevision of unit layout\" referred to in the letter of consent. There was no room even\n\nto say, in respect of the two plans attached, that the differences were\n\n\"marginal\" as Alexia was alleged to have said. On the face of the two plans\n\nattached, it must have been obvious to any looking at the plans that a clerical error had\n\noccurred and that one of the plans had been annexed in error.24.    That a clerical mistake had been made was obvious not only\n\nfrom the fact that the layouts in the two plans were identical; it was also apparent\n\nfrom the stamps that appeared on the two plans. At the bottom right of both the plans\n\nthe words \"Layout of Approved Plan\" with the date \"28/01/96\" stamped:\n\na clear indicator that both were copies of the layout plan approved on 28 January 1996\n\n– ie Plan 1. Further, in one of the plans, consistent with the words \"Layout of\n\nApproved Plan\", there was another stamp bearing the words \"Approved Plan\".\n\nUnder the words \"Approved Plan\" the unit number to which the plan related was\n\ncorrectly stated as #06-16. In the other plan, the additional stamp read: \"Proposed\n\nRevision\". The same layout could not at the same time be the \"Approved\n\nLayout\" as well as the \"Proposed Revision\" to that layout. Further, under\n\nthe words \"Proposed Revision\", the unit number stated was of another unit\n\n#06-15, and not #06-16 the unit purchased by Goh and Lee. It would have been obvious from\n\nall this that a clerical error had occurred and that the \"Proposed Revision\"\n\nplan in respect of unit #06-16 had not been attached to the letter of consent that Goh and\n\nLee signed.25.    The learned trial judge does not appear to have given sufficient\n\nconsideration to the fact that when Goh and Lee found two identical layout plans attached\n\nto the letter of consent they would have known that something was amiss. Even if Alexia\n\ndid in fact say to Lee that the changes were marginal, that statement – in the light\n\nof the identical layouts in the two plans attached – just could not be correct.\n\nI therefore cannot agree with the learned trial judge that there was \"nothing\n\nuntoward\" and \"nothing suspect\" in what Alexia said.26.    The learned trial judge also appears to have misdirected herself\n\nwhen she stated in her Grounds of Judgment:\"If Winjoy wished to take the position that it wasimpossiblefor the plaintiffs not to have been aware of the mistake in the layout plan, Winjoy should\n\n  have called [Alexia].\"(Emphasis added.)The identical nature of the layout in the two plans attached and the\n\ninconsistency between the words \"Approved Layout Plan\" and \"Proposed\n\nRevision\" stamped on one of the plans, are such that Goh and Lee would be on notice\n\nthat there was a mistake in the plans attached. In those circumstances, I could not\n\nagree with the learned trial judge that it was \"impossible\" for Winjoy, without\n\ncalling Alexia, to take the position that Goh and Lee were aware of the mistake in the\n\nlayout plan. I was of the view that not only was such a conclusion possible but, in the\n\ncircumstances, it was the proper conclusion to arrive at.27.    Sitting as an appellate judge I would, ordinarily,\n\nbe reluctant to interfere with a finding of fact made by the trial judge.\n\nI would do so only for good reason. In this case, I found that the learned trial\n\njudge’s finding went against the weight of the evidence. I was therefore unable to\n\nuphold her finding that it was \"perfectly reasonable for Goh and Lee to repose trust\n\nin what Alexia said\". It seemed to me that the truth of the matter was that when Goh\n\nand Lee signed the letter of consent on 25 March 1996, they were not particularly\n\nconcerned with the layout of the unit and did not trouble themselves to have the obvious\n\nerror of having two identical plans attached to the letter of consent corrected or\n\nproperly clarified. There was therefore no question of their reposing trust in what Alexia\n\nsaid.28.    This finding that Goh and Lee were indifferent to the layout of\n\nthe unit was further supported by the fact that Evelyn, a co-owner of unit #06-16, had, on\n\n26 March 1996 – ie the very next day – signed a similar letter of consent in\n\nrespect of another unit in the same development (#01-13) which Evelyn purchased. The\n\nlayout of the plan stamped \"Approved Layout\" (Plan 1) attached thereto –\n\nsave for an additional enclosed space by reason if it being a ground floor plan –\n\nwas identical to the layout in the two plans attached to the letter that Goh and Lee\n\nsigned. The layout of the other plan stamped \"Proposed Revision\" (Plan 2) was\n\ndistinctly different from the \"Approved Layout\" plan (Plan 1). Given the\n\ncloseness of the relationship between Evelyn, Goh and Lee, it goes against the grain that\n\nEvelyn did not draw the attention of Goh or Lee to the distinctly different layout plans.29.    Another unusual feature was the fact that before exercising the\n\noption and entering into a S&P Agreement, Goh and Lee had not, through their\n\nsolicitors, asked Winjoy to explain – an explanation that other purchasers of units\n\nin the \"Blossomvale\" who had signed letters of consent with identical plans\n\nattached had sought – why the two plans were identical. The claim by Lee that he paid\n\nno attention at all to the brochure sent by Winjoy (which incorporated the Proposed\n\nRevision) was also surprising.30.    I accepted the submission of Winjoy that Goh and Lee were\n\nspeculators and that the internal layout of the unit they purchased was not of particular\n\nconcern to them. In signing the letter of consent with the knowledge that the plans\n\nannexed were in error, Goh and Lee were signifying their consent to whatever changes to\n\nthe layout plan that the Building Authority might approve. Their prime concern – in\n\nthe bullish property market then prevailing – was to secure a unit in the\n\n\"Blossomvale\". In those circumstances, I found that there was no breach of cl\n\n8(1) when Winjoy constructed unit #06-16 in accordance with Plan 2. Reluctant though I was\n\nto upset a finding of fact by a trial judge, I formed the view that in this case it would\n\nbe proper to do so.31.    The above finding is enough grounds on which to allow\n\nWinjoy’s appeal and set aside the decision of the learned trial judge. However, Mr\n\nLee Han Yang (counsel for Winjoy) had submitted at length on the issue of whether Goh and\n\nLee, in the event Winjoy was in breach of their obligation under cl 8(1) to build unit\n\n#06-16 in accordance with Plan 1, were entitled – as the learned trial judge had held\n\n– to obtain liquidated damages under cl 11 and, if not, whether they could, besides\n\nrequiring Winjoy to re-do the layout under cl 18(1) of the S&P Agreement (which Winjoy\n\nhad done), obtain further damages from Winjoy. These issues, in view of the finding I made\n\nthat Winjoy was not in breach of cl 8(1) of the S&P Agreement, are strictly\n\nirrelevant. I address them here only for the sake of completeness.",
        "Liquidated damages": ".32.    Liquidated damages are payable by the vendor if, to trace the\n\nlanguage used in cl 11(3) of the S&P Agreement, \"the vendor is unable to deliver\n\nvacant possession of the building unit to the purchaser on the date specified in cl\n\n11(1)\". The date specified in cl 11(1) was \"on or before the 31stday of October 1998\". Clause 11(1) required that the vendor, inter alia, to complete\n\nthe building unit \"so as to be fit for occupation\" before delivering vacant\n\npossession.33.    In this case, Winjoy had delivered, and Goh and Lee had accepted,\n\nvacant possession of unit #06-16 on 2 July 1998 – a date well within the delivery\n\ndate of 31 October 1998 specified in cl 11(1). At the time of the delivery all the\n\nconditions stipulated in cll 11(1) and 11(2) had been met and there was no dispute that\n\nunit #06-16, when handed over to Goh and Lee on 2 July 1998, was \"fit for\n\noccupation\" in the ordinary sense of that expression. Goh and Lee’s complaint\n\nrelating to unit #06-16 was not that it was not \"fit for occupation\" but that\n\nits layout did not accord with the layout envisaged in their contract with Winjoy.34.    The learned trial judge in awarding liquidated damages under cl\n\n11(3) for the alleged breach by Winjoy in not having built the unit in accordance with\n\nplans approved by Goh and Lee said:\"Clause 11 provides that the vendor shall complete the building\n\n  unit so as to be fit for occupation and remove all surplus material, plant and rubbish\n\n  from the building unit and the housing project and deliver vacant possession by a\n\n  specified date.The purpose of Clause 11 would be defeated if the vendor could be\n\n  treated as having delivered possession when works, inspection by authorities and handover\n\n  of a key were pending. I found that Winjoy delivered possession only on 21 August\n\n  1999.\"(Emphasis added.)With respect, I do not think that that approach is tenable. The\n\n\"works and inspection by the authorities\" referred to by the learned trial judge\n\nwere undertaken by Winjoy as a consequence of complaints from Goh and Lee after vacant\n\npossession under cl 11(1) had been delivered to Goh and Lee. These complaints – that\n\nthe layout of the unit was not in accordance with the plans that had been agreed to by Goh\n\nand Lee – did not detract from the fact that the unit was \"fit for\n\noccupation\" and that vacant possession of the unit had been handed to Goh and Lee on\n\n2 July 1998.35.    The remedy provided for in the S&P Agreement to cover\n\ncomplaints such as those raised by Goh and Lee is contained in cl 18(1) which reads:\"18. (1)Any defect, shrinkage or other faults in the\n\n  buildingand in the housing project and all the common property thereto which\n\n  shall become apparent within a period of 12 months from the date of notice to the\n\n  Purchaser to take vacant possession andwhich shall be dueto defective\n\n  workmanship or materials orto the building unitand the housing project and\n\n  all the common property theretonot having been constructed in accordance with\n\n  the specifications and plans(amended or unamended, as the case may be)shall\n\n  be made good by the Vendor at its own cost and expensewithin one month of its\n\n  having received written notice thereof from the Purchaser and if the defects, shrinkage or\n\n  other faults are not made good by the Vendor as aforesaid, the Purchaser and the\n\n  management corporation of the housing project shall be entitled to recover from the Vendor\n\n  the costs of making good the defects, shrinkage or other faults and the Purchaser may\n\n  deduct such costs from any sum which has been held by the Purchaser’s solicitors as\n\n  stakeholder for the Vendor.Provided that the Purchaser shall at any time after the expiry of the\n\n  said period of one month notify the Vendor of the cost of carrying out any works to make\n\n  good the defects, shrinkage and other faults before the commencement of the works and\n\n  shall give the Vendor an opportunity to carry out the works himself within 14 days from\n\n  the date the Purchaser has notified the Vendor of his intention to carry out the said\n\n  works.\"(Emphasis added.)Insofar as is relevant to the issues in this case, cl 18(1) in effect\n\nprovides that:\"Any defect, shrinkage or other faults in the building …\n\n  which shall be due … to the building unit … not having been constructed in\n\n  accordance with the specifications and plans … shall be made good by the Vendor at\n\n  its own cost and expense …\"Goh and Lee’s complaint, that unit #06-16 had not been built\n\naccording to the agreed layout, had been attended to by Winjoy at its own cost and expense\n\nto the satisfaction of Goh and Lee. By so doing, Winjoy had complied with its obligations\n\nunder cl 18(1).36.    The remedying of defects under cl 18(1) is, however,\n\na separate regime from the claim for liquidated damages for late completion under cl\n\n11(3). In the present case, a claim for liquidated damages under cl 11 of the S&P\n\nAgreement would have been well founded if, and only if, Winjoy had failed, by 31 October\n\n1998, to hand over to Goh and Lee unit #06-16 in a condition \"fit for\n\noccupation\". But that was not the claim here. The claim here was for a breach of\n\ncl 8(1) of the S&P Agreement, namely, the obligation of Winjoy to build the unit\n\nin accordance with plans approved by Goh and Lee. For such a breach, a claim for\n\nliquidated damages under cl 11(3) is not apposite.37.    There is support for the above proposition in the case ofKassim\n\nSyed Ali & Ors v Grace Development Pte Ltd & Anor[1998] 2 SLR 393. That\n\nwas also a case involving a developer and a purchaser of a unit in the development. In\n\nthat case, Grace Development was found to be in breach of the S&P Agreement for not\n\nhaving delivered to a purchaser (Kassim) a unit in a \"hotel-cum-shopping\n\ncomplex\" as envisaged in the S&P Agreement between the parties. Kassim\n\nsought to obtain liquidated damages from Grace Development under cl 14(2) of that\n\nS&P Agreement for the loss he suffered as a result of that breach. Clause 14(2)\n\nprovided as follows:\"The said notice to complete shall be given by the vendor on or\n\n  before 31 December 1990. If the vendor shall fail to give the said notice to complete on\n\n  the date fixed for completion the vendor shall pay to the purchaser liquidated damages\n\n  calculated from day to day commencing from the date when such notice to complete should\n\n  have been given at the rate of 9% per annum on a sum equal to 85% of the purchase price\n\n  such interest may be deducted from any instalment due and payable to the vendor.\"Kassim argued that, because of the breach of contract, Grace\n\nDevelopment was unable to serve a valid notice to complete on Kassim and, until such time\n\nas the court orders completion to take place, Kassim was entitled to liquidated damages\n\nunder cl 14(2). LP Thean JA, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal, rejected that\n\nargument as \"wholly unsound\" and went on to say at page 404E:\"The liquidated damages under cl 14(2) are payable only in the\n\n  event that the notice to complete was not given by the first respondents on or before 31\n\n  December 1990. The notice to complete was given by the first respondents on 15\n\n  April 1991 or thereabouts and liquidated damages computed in accordance with cl 14(2) had\n\n  been deducted from the amounts payable to the first respondents as shown in the completion\n\n  account.Clause 14(2) is not applicable in assessing damages for the loss, if any,\n\n  occasioned to the appellants by reason of the breach of contract on the part of the first\n\n  respondents. We can find no basis for applying this provision.\"(Emphasis added.)In that passage, the Court of Appeal has, in effect, ruled that a\n\nclause such as cl 14(2) – a liquidated damages clause for late completion –\n\nis not applicable in assessing damages for the loss, if any, occasioned to the\n\npurchaser by reason of breaches of contract by the developer other than failure to deliver\n\nvacant possession of the unit by the contracted date.38.    Kassim’s arguments in that case were analogous to Goh and\n\nLee’s arguments, in the present case, that the notice to take vacant possession under\n\ncl 11(1) was not valid because the building unit that Winjoy wished to deliver was not the\n\nbuilding unit that Winjoy had contracted to build and, accordingly, vacant possession of\n\nunit #06-16 was not delivered to Goh and Lee by 31 October 1998. For the reasons given by\n\nthe Court of Appeal, I rejected that argument.39.    In the case of Kassim, the Court of Appeal held that Kassim, in\n\norder to recover damages, would have to prove the loss he had in fact suffered by being\n\ngiven a unit in an \"office-cum-shopping complex\" instead of a\n\n\"hotel-cum-shopping complex\". To prove that loss Kassim would have had to adduce\n\nevidence that the unit delivered to him was inferior (in terms of market value) to the\n\nunit in a \"hotel-cum-shopping complex\" that should have been delivered to him.\n\nKassim failed to adduce any such evidence and as a consequence he was not, at the\n\ntrial, awarded any damages. In upholding that decision, LP Thean JA stated at page 404A:\"Damages\" are compensatory, and one cannot seek compensation\n\n  in vacuo. Compensation must be measured against the loss suffered. In our judgment, the\n\n  appellants have not proved that what they got was less valuable than what they had\n\n  contracted for\".Unlike Kassim, Goh and Lee in the present case were not claiming for\n\nany diminution in the market value of the unit but for the loss suffered as a result of\n\ntheir inability to rent the unit during the period of the remedial works. Even so, the\n\nburden of proving the rental loss was on Goh and Lee.",
        "Damages": ".40.    I now turn to the question of the remedies available to Goh and\n\nLee if Winjoy had in fact been in breach of cl 8 in having built unit #06-16 with a layout\n\ndifferent from that agreed to with Goh and Lee. For such a breach, the solution provided\n\nfor in the S&P Agreement was in cl 18(1). Winjoy had attended to this complaint of Goh\n\nand Lee and the requirements of cl 18(1) had, in effect, been adhered to.\n\nThe question that arose was whether the purchaser, besides getting the vendor to make\n\ngood the defects under cl 18(1), could hold the vendor liable for other losses sustained.41.    In the present case, the remedial works undertaken by Winjoy took\n\na considerable amount of time and Goh and Lee had (during that time) been unable to\n\nrent out the unit. They had, during the period, also suffered losses by way of property\n\ntax and service charges for the unit. Could they recover such losses?42.    In principle, I did not see why a developer, in a case like this,\n\nshould not, in addition to carrying out remedial works under cl 18(1), be liable to\n\nthe purchaser for losses arising from the breach, including loss of rental income whilst\n\nthe remedial works were being carried out. Mr Lee did not seriously seek to argue\n\notherwise and limited his submission to pointing out that at the hearing below no evidence\n\nat all was adduced as to how rentable the units were, how long it would take to obtain a\n\ntenant and what rental the unit could reasonably fetch in the market.43.    I will deal briefly with the claim for the property tax and\n\nservice charges before I deal with the claim for lost rental. Mr Lee pointed out that a\n\nconsiderable portion of the time taken to re-do the flat was attributable to delays on the\n\npart of Goh and Lee in responding in a timely way to matters that required their input and\n\nthat Winjoy had, in any event, as a gesture of goodwill, reimbursed Goh and Lee the\n\nproperty tax and service charges up to 30 June 1999 when Winjoy returned the front door\n\nkeys of the unit to Goh and Lee. He submitted that by that date the remedial works had,\n\nfor all practical purposes, been completed and Winjoy should not be held responsible for\n\nproperty tax and service charges after that date. I accepted that submission.44.    The claim for lost rental had been argued, at the hearing below,\n\non the basis of liquidated damages payable under cl 11(3) and as a consequence little or\n\nno attention had been paid to proving actual losses. Given the paucity/absence of\n\nevidence, the court, if it were to assess the rent lost, would be relying on hearsay\n\nand/or indulging in speculation. Mr Lee submitted that, as no evidence was adduced on the\n\nbasis of which the court could determine the amount of rent that could reasonably be said\n\nto have been lost, no damages should be awarded. Mr James Yu (counsel for Goh and Lee)\n\nsubmitted that, at the very least, the court should award some nominal damages for the\n\nlost rent.45.    Goh and Lee, not having adduced evidence at the hearing below\n\nrelating to the rental that could be said to have been lost during the period the unit was\n\nbeing renovated, it is very difficult for a court to assess what that loss should be.\n\nHowever, in view of the fact that Winjoy was, in the first place, not in breach of cl 8(1)\n\nof the S&P Agreement, the issue, even of awarding nominal damages, was academic as no\n\ndamages would, in any event, be payable.46.    For the above reasons, I allowed the appeal with costs both here\n\nand below.Sgd:S.
