        "The presumption in s 18(1) of the MDA": "19        Section 18(1)(a) of the\n\nMDA provides:Any person who is proved to have in his possession or custody or under\n\n    his control anything containing a controlled drug … shall, until the contrary is\n\n    proved, be presumed to have had that drug in his possession.InVan Damme Johannes v PP[1994] 2 SLR 246, the Court of Appeal\n\ndecided that neither physical possession nor physical control was required in order for\n\nthe above presumption to be invoked. As such, although Van Damme had actually ceded\n\nphysical possession and control of the suitcase of drugs to the Singapore Airport Terminal\n\nServices (SATS), he nevertheless retained possession of the suitcase for the purposes of s\n\n18(1) as he had the baggage tag to the suitcase and could obtain access to it if he\n\napproached the Lost and Found staff.20        In the present case, the\n\nappellant had never denied her ownership of her handbag, and the trial judge placed much\n\nreliance on her testimony that (i) she habitually placed her handbag on the sofa backrest,\n\nand (ii) Tables 6 and 7 were tables habitually occupied by her friends. Furthermore, the\n\nappellant had testified that Sybil had to seek her permission before she could retrieve\n\nher own belongings from the appellant’s handbag. As such, the trial judge concluded\n\nthat the appellant had retained possession of the handbag, such that the presumptions in s\n\n18(1) should be applied against the appellant.21        The trial judge’s\n\nreasoning was challenged by the appellant, who, before me, emphasised that the bag had\n\nbeen left unattended. The appellant also sought to distinguishVan Damme Johannes,\n\npointing out that, in that case, the suitcase was at all times in the control of the SATS,\n\nhaving being checked in at the airline’s luggage counter. The in-flight spur area\n\nfrom which the suitcase was recovered was not a public area, access to it being restricted\n\nto airport staff and public officers. Although Van Damme did not have physical possession\n\nand control of the suitcase during that time, he was nevertheless the acknowledged owner\n\nof the suitcase, and no ordinary member of the public would have been able to have access\n\nto the suitcase without first presenting the luggage claim ticket to the airline.22        InPP v Ho So Mui[1993] 2 SLR 59, the Court of Appeal noted that the question of what amounts to\n\n\"possession\" for the purposes of s 18(1) is \"one of fact and necessarily\n\nvaries from case to case\". I agreed with the appellant’s contention that the\n\nfacts inVan Dammewere very different from those in the present case. I noted that\n\nthe appellant had left her handbag in a public place for at least an hour. Even presuming\n\nthat the appellant’s friends at Tables 6 and 7 acknowledged her ownership of the bag,\n\nnevertheless none of them felt any responsibility for it or they would not have simply\n\nleft it behind when they decided to leave Velvet Underground. Furthermore, not all of the\n\npersons seated at Tables 6 and 7 were known to the appellant, and the bag itself was of a\n\nrelatively ‘open’ nature (being fastened by a single button only). In light of\n\nthese circumstances, I felt that it would be going too far to find that the appellant had\n\npossession on the basis of her ownership of the handbag and her placing it with her\n\nfriends alone.23        The above said, I was\n\nnevertheless of the view that the invocation of the presumption was appropriate in the\n\ncircumstances of the case. By Sybil’s account, the cocaine was already in the\n\nappellant’s handbag before she even went to Zouk and left her handbag behind. If this\n\nwas believed, the prosecution would have succeeded in proving that the appellant had\n\npossession or control of the drugs, thus triggering the s 18(1) presumption of possession.\n\nAs explained below, I saw no reason to disturb the trial judge’s finding that\n\nSybil’s account should be believed, and hence agreed with the conclusion that the s\n\n18(1) presumption applied. It followed from this that the trial judge was entirely correct\n\nin requiring the appellant to prove her defences on a balance of probabilities.",
        "Whether the trial judge should have preferred Sybil’s evidence to\n\nthe appellant’s": "24        The invocation of the s 18\n\npresumption aside, the only way to prove the case against the appellant was to accept\n\nSybil’s evidence and, as a corollary, reject the appellant’s, as Sybil was the\n\nonly person who was able to explain the presence of the cocaine in the appellant’s\n\nwallet. The appellant as such raised several arguments before me meant to demonstrate that\n\nthe trial judge had erred in accepting Sybil as a reliable witness. As shall be seen\n\nbelow, I was not convinced that the trial judge had reached the wrong conclusions on\n\nSybil’s and the appellant’s respective credibility.",
        "The standard by which to judge Sybil’s evidence": "25        The first criticism made\n\nby the appellant of the trial judge’s findings was based on para 87 of the grounds of\n\ndecision, in which the trial judge had commented:As to the submissions concerning Sybil’s drug\n\n    history and her lack of truthfulness in the first statement, if the gist of these\n\n    submissions was that I should treat her evidence with caution, then that was precisely how\n\n    I treated the evidence of all the witnesses.The appellant argued that this was the wrong approach to take, as Sybil\n\nwas not just any other witness. Instead, she had on her own admission consumed cocaine\n\nwith the appellant, and should hence have been treated like an accomplice, with all the\n\nattendant caution implicit in such treatment. The prosecution for its part contended that\n\nSybil was not an accomplice as the only crime she had been committed was consumption of\n\ndrugs, while the appellant had been charged with the possession of drugs.26        I agreed with the\n\nprosecution’s contention that Sybil was not an accomplice in the strictest sense of\n\nthe word. At the same time, it was manifestly clear to me that Sybil could not be treated\n\nlike any other witness. Her own confessed act of consumption was so closely tied with the\n\nissue of the appellant’s possession of the cocaine that she would definitely have to\n\nbe considered an interested witness, and a very interested one at that. For this reason, I\n\ntook the view that Sybil’s evidence ought to have been treated with the same caution\n\nafforded the evidence of accomplices, even though she was not strictly speaking an\n\naccomplice.27        Having said the above, I\n\nwas satisfied that the trial judge did subject Sybil’s evidence to the high level of\n\nscrutiny which should be accorded the testimony of accomplices.",
        "Sybil’s credibility as a witness": "28        Section 116 of the\n\nEvidence Act (Cap 97) provides that the court may presume:(b)        that an\n\n    accomplice is unworthy of credit and his evidence needs to be treated with cautionThe above was interpreted inChai Chien Wei Kelvin v PP[1991] 1 SLR 25 as meaning:Whether or not the court should believe the evidence of\n\n    the accomplice would depend on all the circumstances of the case and the evidence must be\n\n    tested against the objective facts as well as the inherent probabilities and\n\n    improbabilities…Treating Sybil’s evidence with caution29        The appellant raised\n\nseveral issues as tending to show the unreliability of Sybil’s evidence. The first\n\nwas the inconsistencies between Sybil’s statement to the CNB on 31 October 2000, in\n\nwhich she stated that she did not know whether the appellant abused drugs, and her\n\nstatement of 19 February 2001, in which she gave a full account of the consumption\n\nincident in the toilets outside Double-O. A second issue was an alleged promise of\n\nimmunity made by the Investigating Officer (the ‘IO’) to Sybil when the second\n\nstatement was made, arguing that since the IO did not have the legal authority to offer\n\nimmunity, Sybil’s fate remained open-ended and there was hence incentive for her to\n\nlie in an effort to get herself out of trouble. A final issue was that Sybil had not\n\ndisclosed that the appellant had asked her to lie until the trial itself, such that Sybil\n\nmust have been improvising her testimony in order to exaggerate the culpability of the\n\nappellant.30        I found that it was clear\n\nfrom the grounds of decision as well as from the Notes of Evidence that the trial judge\n\nwas well aware of the inconsistencies in the statements and sought an explanation from\n\nSybil. The explanation that Sybil provided - namely that she had lied in her statement of\n\n31 October 2000 as she feared getting involved in the CNB investigations, but fear and\n\nguilt in the intervening months led her to tell the truth to the CNB – was to my mind\n\nperfectly reasonable and I concluded that the trial judge had not erred in accepting it.\n\nThe same applied to Sybil’s initial non-disclosure of the appellant’s request\n\nfor her to lie. Again, the trial judge was well aware of this non-disclosure and had\n\ndemanded an explanation from Sybil for it. I was of the opinion that Sybil’s\n\nexplanation – that her main reason for not telling the truth on 31 October 2000 was\n\nto keep herself out of trouble, and she did not think that the appellant’s request\n\nwas very important as she thought it came naturally – was not such as to arouse\n\nsuspicion.31        As for the alleged promise\n\nof immunity, I was not convinced it detracted in any way from the reasonableness of her\n\nexplanation. For one thing, the alleged promise of immunity was only made after Sybil had\n\nconfessed everything to the CNB. Sybil was as such leaving herself open to criminal\n\ncharges by telling the truth. I also considered whether a promise of immunity had in fact\n\nbeen made by the IO. What had actually transpired on 19 February was that, after\n\nconfessing that she had consumed cocaine, Sybil asked the IO if she was going to be\n\ncharged. The IO then told her that since the focus of the investigation was presently on\n\nthe possession of the drugs, not consumption, Sybil would not have to worry about getting\n\nin trouble. In the circumstances, I took the view that it would be extremely far-fetched\n\nto consider that a promise of immunity had been made.Testing the evidence against objective facts32        The appellant’s\n\narguments under this head related to the colour of the appellant’s wallet on the\n\nnight in question. While both the prosecution and the appellant agreed that the wallet was\n\na black wallet, Sybil testified that she thought the appellant was using a green snakeskin\n\nwallet. The appellant hence contended that Sybil’s mistake as to the colour of the\n\nwallet showed that she was also lying when she said that she saw the appellant take the\n\ncocaine out from the wallet.33        While it is patently\n\nobvious that Sybil made a mistake as to the colour of the wallet, I failed to see how the\n\nmistake could be said to lead logically to the conclusion that Sybil wasalsolying\n\nabout the consumption incident. Sybil had earlier testified that she did not often notice\n\nthings such as wallets and clothing, and the appellant herself had conceded that she often\n\nchanged her wallets and bags to match her clothing. Sybil’s attention during the\n\nconsumption episode would have been focussed on the cocaine, and I did not see anything\n\nsinister in her inability to remember the colour of the wallet.Weighing the inherent probabilities and improbabilities in the evidence34        The final attempt by the\n\nappellant to undermine the trial judge’s assessment of Sybil’s credibility came\n\nfrom a series of arguments purporting to show the improbability of Sybil’s account of\n\nthe cocaine consumption. In particular, the appellant took issue with Sybil’s claim\n\nthat the cocaine was consumed in a public toilet with a queue waiting outside, and that\n\nthe cocaine was cut into lines on the toilet seat cover itself. However, I noted that\n\nSybil did testify in the court below that their original intention had been to use the\n\ntoilets at Double-O, only to find that they were still being constructed. The appellant\n\nherself had also admitted under cross-examination the following: that she would have\n\nexpected a certain amount of privacy in the cubicle of a ladies’ toilet; that the\n\ntoilet at Robertson Walk was far from being as dirty as a toilet in a hawker centre; and\n\nthat snorting cocaine would not generate the type of noise or smell which might arouse the\n\nsuspicions of the persons queuing outside.35        As for the\n\nappellant’s claim that Sybil’s and her getting into a single cubicle together\n\nwould have aroused the attention of third parties, I noted that the appellant herself had\n\nclaimed that she and Sybil had gone together into a single cubicle, but to urinate and not\n\nto consume drugs. It followed that I could hardly accept that such an act was improbable\n\nwhen the appellant herself had accepted that there was nothing odd in it.36        One last criticism made by\n\nthe appellant under this head was of Sybil’s testimony that she \"didn’t\n\nfeel anything\" after consuming the cocaine, contending that her inability to describe\n\nthe effects of cocaine were more consistent with the fact that they had not in fact\n\nconsumed any cocaine. The appellant also suggested that Sybil ought to have commented on\n\nthe lack of feeling to the appellant immediately afterwards. However, I noted that, in the\n\ntrial below, Sybil had not been questioned on her lack of sensation, the appellant’s\n\ncounsel having let the matter drop during cross-examination. To take issue with it now\n\nwould run foul of the rule inBrowne v Dunn1893] 6 R 67, which states that any\n\nmatter upon which it is proposed to contradict the evidence-in-chief given by the witness\n\nmust normally be put to him so that he may have an opportunity of explaining the\n\ncontradiction, and failure to do this may be held to imply acceptance of the\n\nevidence-in-chief.37        I was also aware that the\n\namount of cocaine consumed was in all likelihood very small. 0.27 grams of cocaine had\n\nbeen seized from the appellant at Zouk, constituting the remainder of the original\n\nquantity in the sachet. Sybil’s testimony was that the appellant only poured\n\n\"some\" out, sufficient only for two lines of two cm per person. In the absence\n\nof expert evidence on the effects of consumption – evidence which was open to the\n\nappellant to adduce – and counsel’s failure to question Sybil on the effects of\n\nthe cocaine during the trial, I concluded that it would be inappropriate to make too much\n\nof the absence of any after-effects from the cocaine.38        All in all, I took the\n\nview that the appellant’s arguments under this head did not go very far in supporting\n\nher argument that the trial judge failed to consider the inherent improbabilities in\n\nSybil’s account. I found that the account was not improbable in the first place, and\n\nthe appellant’s own admissions under cross-examination led me to conclude that the\n\nappellant had exaggerated the alleged improbabilities in the story in an attempt to save\n\nher own skin.Whether independent corroborating evidence was needed39        It followed from my\n\nfindings above that I also rejected the appellant’s argument that the trial judge\n\nought to have sought independent corroborating evidence before relying on Sybil’s\n\nevidence to convict the appellant. The need for such evidence depended on the trial\n\njudge’s assessment of the flaws (if any) in Sybil’s evidence and whether she\n\nfelt that it would be safe to convict the appellant on Sybil’s evidence alone. I\n\nfound that, of the many criticisms made by the appellant, few were valid and Sybil was\n\nnevertheless able to provide reasonable explanations for them. It is trite law that an\n\nappellate court will be slow to disturb the findings of a lower court unless they were\n\nclearly reached against the weight of the evidence –Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713. The trial judge has the benefit of observing the witnesses in person, an\n\nadvantage denied to the appellate court, and the prima facie reasonableness of\n\nSybil’s explanations militated strongly against my overturning of the trial\n\njudge’s assessment of Sybil as an \"honest and credible\" witness.",
        "The credibility of the appellant’s defence": "40        At the same time, I agreed\n\nwith the trial judge’s conclusion that the appellant’s defence should be\n\ndisregarded. As the trial judge has pointed out, the appellant’s own testimony was\n\nrife with inconsistencies, notably her ability to remember recall the exact sequence of\n\nevents by which Sybil allegedly retrieved her possessions from the appellant’s\n\nhandbag while at Velvet Underground, while at the same time claiming that this was a\n\ncommon occurrence and that she had not kept her eye on Sybil while they were at Velvet\n\nUnderground. The appellant also came up with far-fetched explanations to refute the\n\nprosecution’s suggestion that a person who wanted to plant cocaine in the\n\nappellant’s handbag would simply slip it into the bottom of the bag rather than take\n\nthe extra trouble of putting it in the appellant’s wallet.41        A third example was the\n\nappellant’s claim that she had contacted Sybil after she found out about the\n\nlatter’s interview with the CNB on 19 February 2001 because she was curious as the\n\nCNB had not contacted her for a long time. However, the prosecution was able to show that\n\nthe appellant had been interviewed by the CNB only two weeks prior to Sybil’s\n\ninterview, thereby showing her claim of curiosity to be a lie. In light of this\n\ndisclosure, it would not be unreasonable to draw the inference that the appellant was\n\nconcerned that Sybil should break down and confess to the CNB.42        The appellant also made\n\nmuch of the fact that she had admitted ownership of her handbag to ASP Tan, contending\n\nthat it demonstrated her innocence. At the same time, she took issue with the trial\n\njudge’s finding that she had had many drinks that evening and would not have been\n\nable to identify ASP Tan as a law enforcement officer in the short time span afforded her.43        I agreed that it would not\n\nhave been fair in the circumstances to conclude that the appellant did not know that ASP\n\nTan was a law enforcement officer. Although the appellant had had some ten to twelve\n\ndrinks that evening, her testimony in court was that she was \"happy, high\", not\n\ninebriated, and it was accepted that the appellant had a high tolerance for drink.\n\nFurthermore, I noted that the trial judge was willing to accept both Sybil and\n\nJerry’s testimony that they too recognised ASP Tan as a law enforcement officer,\n\nalthough the former, too, had consumed drinks.44        The above said, I did not\n\nfind the appellant’s act of claiming her bag from a known law enforcement officer to\n\ngo very far at all in showing her innocence of the charge. As the trial judge noted in her\n\ngrounds of decision, there were other reasons for the appellant’s actions. Chief\n\namong them was the fact that the handbag could have been traced back to the appellant,\n\nsince she had informed both Diana Chong and Soo Han that she had lost her handbag.\n\nFurthermore, the handbag contained the name-cards of the appellant’s friends, and the\n\nhandbag could have been traced back to her through them. If the appellant was lucid enough\n\nto notice ASP Tan’s clothing that night and to reason out that he was a law\n\nenforcement officer, she would also have been capable of concluding that she should\n\nacknowledged ownership of her bag since it could always be traced back to her.",
        "Other issues raised by the appellant": "45      Apart from the foregoing, the appellant\n\nraised two further points which she contended the trial judge ought to have taken account,\n\nand which, if they had, would purportedly have militated against a finding of guilt.",
        "The absence of ‘crucial’ pieces of evidence": "46        First, the appellant\n\ncontended that the IO had failed to test the appellant’s urine sample properly, and\n\nalso did not produce the currency note which was used by the appellant and Sybil to snort\n\nthe cocaine. The appellant argued that these omissions gave rise to an adverse inference\n\nwhich undermined the prosecution’s case.47        Section 116 of the\n\nEvidence Act provides that the court may presume:(g)        that evidence which could\n\n    be and is not produced would if produced be unfavourable to the person who withholds itThe prosecution for its part had explained that the CNB were not\n\nexpecting the drug concerned to be cocaine, and hence did not test the appellant’s\n\nurine sample for it. As Dr Lui explained in the court below, it was too late to test the\n\nurine sample for cocaine by the time the CNB realised that the drugs in the packet were in\n\nfact cocaine. In any event, since the urine test might or might not have shown that the\n\nappellant did consume cocaine, such that it was a neutral point which should not influence\n\nthe decision. As for the currency note, the prosecution explained that the CNB were not in\n\na position to seize seemingly innocuous items in the possession of the appellant as they\n\nwould not have known that a currency note was used to snort the cocaine until much later\n\nin the investigations.48        Illustration (g) is an\n\nevidentiary device meant to penalise parties who withhold evidence, and the following\n\npassage fromMususamy v PP[1987] 1 MLJ 492is useful:It is essential to appreciate the scope of s 114(g) [now s 116(g)] lest\n\n    it be carried too far outside its limit. Adverse inference under that illustration can\n\n    only be drawn if there is withholding or suppression of evidence and not merely on account\n\n    of failure to obtain evidence.Furthermore, it would not be appropriate to draw an adverse inference\n\nif a reasonable explanation for the failure to produce is given –Murugan v Lew\n\nChu Cheong[1980] 2 MLJ 139. In the present case, while the absence of evidence on the\n\nurine test and the currency note were most unfortunate, I concluded it would not have been\n\nappropriate in the circumstances to draw an adverse inference against the prosecution.49        I was also mindful that it\n\nwas not crucial to the prosecution’s case against the appellant to produce such\n\nevidence, as it is clear that a conviction may be warranted on the testimony of one\n\nwitness alone, so long as the court is aware of the dangers and subjects the evidence to\n\ncareful scrutiny. This is so whether the witness is an accomplice –Chua Poh Kiat\n\nAnthony v PP[1998] 2 SLR 713– or an interested witness –Tan Khee Koon\n\nv PP[1995] 3 SLR 724,Kwang Boon Keong Peter[1998] 2 SLR 592.",
        "Whether certain pieces of prejudicial evidence should have been\n\nadmitted": "50        The final argument\n\ncanvassed by the appellant was that the trial judge should not have admitted evidence\n\npertaining to the importation or consumption of cocaine by the appellant, since she was\n\nnot being charged with either of these offences, but with possession of cocaine. I found\n\nthis objection to be wholly without merit. As the prosecution has pointed out, the\n\nevidence on importation was only incidentally mentioned by Sybil, as part of her\n\nexplanation as to why she and the appellant ended up in the toilets near Double-O snorting\n\ncocaine. It was very clear to me that such evidence had not been relied on by the trial\n\njudge in convicting the appellant.51        As for the evidence of\n\nconsumption, it was patently clear that such evidence was relevant to the case at hand.\n\nAlthough the appellant was charged with possession and not consumption, Sybil’s\n\naccount linked the accused to the cocaine found in the handbag and, if believed, would\n\ndemolish the appellant’s defence. Although the evidence of drug consumption by the\n\nappellant may indeed have been extremely prejudicial to her, I failed to see how the trial\n\njudge could have justified excluding it, given how crucial it was towards establishing the\n\nappellant’s guilt.Conclusion52        The present case turned\n\nultimately on whether Sybil’s or the appellant’s testimony should be believed.\n\nGiven that Sybil was able to provide prima facie reasonable explanations for those few\n\ninconsistencies in her statements, while the appellant’s story was full of logical\n\nand factual flaws, I concluded that the trial judge was justified in preferring\n\nSybil’s evidence, and accepting it in its entirety. It followed that the appellant\n\nwas unable to rebut the presumption of possession. I would also add that if the s 18\n\npresumption had not applied, Sybil’s evidence was such that the prosecution would\n\nhave proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. Consequently, I dismissed the appeal.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeRepublic of SingaporeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
