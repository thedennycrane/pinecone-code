        "Introduction": "1 In this joint trial, the three accused persons claimed trial to a charge each in relation to 35 bundles of granular/powdery substance containing 301.6 grams of diamorphine (which I shall refer to as “the drugs”). 2 The first accused, Zulkarnain bin Kemat (“Zulkarnain”), faced a charge of having the drugs in his possession for the purpose of trafficking. This is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) of the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“the MDA”). 3 The charge against the second accused, Mohammad Rizwan bin Akbar Husain (“Rizwan”), was that of abetting by instigating Zulkarnain to be in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking. This is an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA. 4 As for the third accused, Saminathan Selvaraju (“Saminathan”), he was charged with trafficking the drugs by delivering them to Zulkarnain, an offence under s 5(1)(a) of the MDA. 5 In brief, the Prosecution’s case was that on 20 November 2013, Rizwan instructed Zulkarnain to collect the drugs. At around 10pm, along Quality Road, Singapore, Saminathan passed the drugs to Zulkarnain. After collecting the drugs, Zulkarnain was meant to deliver the drugs to Rizwan, but he was arrested before he could do so. Turning to the defences, Zulkarnain denied any knowledge of the nature of the drugs, while Rizwan and Saminathan denied any involvement at all. At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the elements of the respective charges had been made out against each of the accused persons, and I convicted them accordingly. 6 Under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA, the prescribed punishment for these offences is death. Section 33B(1)(a) provides that if the two requirements set out in s 33B(2) are satisfied, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement is that the acts of the accused were restricted to those of a “courier”. The second requirement is that the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) certifies that the accused has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. 7 I found that Zulkarnain met both requirements, and exercised my discretion to impose the sentence of life imprisonment. As he was above 50 years old, he was not liable for caning. However, Rizwan met neither of the requirements. As for Saminathan, although he satisfied the first requirement, in that I found his role to be that of a courier, the PP did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. In respect of Rizwan and Saminathan, I imposed the mandatory death sentence. 8 Rizwan and Saminathan have both appealed against their conviction and sentence. I now provide the reasons for my decision, beginning with the evidence for the Prosecution.",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "",
        "Events leading up to the drug transaction": "9 On 20 November 2013, at or about 8.15pm, acting on information received, a group of CNB officers began tailing Zulkarnain from his residence at Block 1 Spooner Road to various locations in Singapore before reaching Chin Bee Drive at about 9.13pm. Zulkarnain was driving a black Honda car with registration number SJF2200B. 10 On the same night, as closed circuit television (“CCTV”) footages revealed, at about 9.20pm, Rizwan left his residence at Block 136 Petir Road. He was wearing a cap, a black T-shirt and long dark pants. He headed in the direction of a parking area. 11 At about 9.55pm, Zulkarnain was seen positioning his car near the junction of Chin Bee Drive and Quality Road. At about the same time, a black Mitsubishi Lancer bearing registration number SGC4606C (“the black Mitsubishi”) was observed to be parked in front of Zulkarnain’s car. The black Mitsubishi was registered under Rizwan’s name.1Foot Note 1×The Agreed Bundle (“AB”), pp 477-478ie,AB477-478.SSgt Azhari bin Rohman (“SSgt Azhari”) observed that the driver was plumb, and wearing a cap.2Foot Note 2×AB257, para 12. 12 Then, both cars were seen driving from Chin Bee Drive into Quality Road, which was a two-way road. SSSgt Mak Weng Chuan (“SSSgt Mak”) observed that the cars drove past a stationary trailer bearing Malaysian registration number WER2508 (“the Trailer”), which was parked along Quality Road (towards the direction of Chin Bee Drive). The Trailer had its hazard lights on. The black Mitsubishi stopped further down along Quality Road (towards the direction of International Road). Meanwhile, Zulkarnain’s car made a U-turn, and parked in front of the Trailer. The driver of the Trailer (observed to be a male Indian) alighted and loaded certain items into Zulkarnain’s car through the left rear passenger side, before returning to the Trailer.3Foot Note 3×AB250, para 13 and AB304.I shall refer to this as “the drug transaction”.",
        "Arrests and seizure of the drugs": "13 Following the drug transaction, the three vehicles left Quality Road, and were separately tailed by the CNB officers. 14 At Tagore Industrial Avenue, Zulkarnain’s car was stopped, and Zulkarnain was arrested by the CNB officers. From the floor mat of the rear of the car, the CNB officers recovered two red plastic bags: the first contained 15 black-taped bundles, while the second contained 20 black-taped bundles. All 35 bundles contained the drugs. The items were seized.4Foot Note 4×AB273, paras 15 and 16. 15 The CNB officers lost sight of the black Mitsubishi when its driver made a sudden U-turn, and sped off along Tampines Avenue. Following investigations, Rizwan was identified as its driver. Rizwan was arrested on 29 November 2013, after he was brought back to Singapore from Malaysia. He had fled to Malaysia on 25 November 2013 by hiding in the boot of a car.5Foot Note 5×Exh P279, paras 20 and 21. 16 The Trailer was tailed by the CNB officers from Quality Road to Tuas checkpoint. It was observed to have passed through the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (“ICA”) gantry at about 10.15pm, and to have headed towards Malaysia. Following investigations, Saminathan was identified as the Trailer’s driver, and the person who carried out the drug transaction. He was arrested on 25 March 2014 at the Woodlands Checkpoint as he was entering Singapore.",
        "Analysis by the Health Sciences Authority": "17 The 35 bundles seized from Zulkarnain’s car were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”). Upon analysis, it was ascertained that the granular/powdery substance within the 35 bundles weighed 11,439 grams in total and was found to contain not less than 301.6 grams of diamorphine.",
        "Statements of Zulkarnain": "18 Pursuant to s 258(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the Prosecution sought to admit 12 statements recorded from Zulkarnain in the course of investigations. Zulkarnain did not object to the admissibility of any of his statements. The 12 statements were: (a) Two contemporaneous statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC by SSgt Bukhari bin Ahmad on 20 and 21 November 2013; (b) The cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC on 21 November 2013 by W/Insp Ng Pei Xin (“W/Insp Ng”); (c) Nine long statements recorded by W/Insp Ng Pei Xin under s 22 of the CPC on various dates, from 21 November 2013 to 6 May 2014. 19 At the outset, I should state that the contents of these statements were fairly consistent. I summarise their key aspects. In the various statements, Zulkarnain consistently stated that on the night of 20 November 2013, he had acted on the instructions of a person whom he knew as “Bos” or “Boss” to collect “illegal” items. The plan was for Zulkarnain to meet “Bos” or “Boss” at Tagore Lane after collecting these items, so that he could hand the items over to “Bos” or “Boss”. “Bos” or “Boss” was also known to him as “Batman”. For convenience, I shall refer to him as “Boss”. 20 Specifically, in the first long statement recorded on 21 November 2013, Zulkarnain stated as follows: (a) Upon being shown nine photographs of different persons, Zulkarnain identified “Boss” as Rizwan.6Foot Note 6×AB417, para 8. (b) Zulkarnain stated that on 20 November 2013, “Boss” called him at 5pm on his blue Nokia handphone (marked as “ZK-HP3”) and told him that there was a job that night and instructed him to get ready. At about 7pm to 8pm, “Boss” called again and told Zulkarnain to head to Chin Bee Drive. At Chin Bee Drive, when “Boss” was near, he instructed Zulkarnain to switch off all his handphones and to use a walkie-talkie to communicate instead.7Foot Note 7×AB416, para 4. (c) Upon arrival, “Boss” instructed Zulkarnain to drive into Quality Road and were he to see a trailer with blinking lights, he was to park in front of that trailer. Then, “Boss” drove on ahead and Zulkarnain followed. Zulkarnain then saw the Trailer with its lights blinking. Zulkarnain did as instructed and parked in front of the Trailer. Then, an Indian man exited the Trailer, walked over, opened the back door of his car, placed some items into his car and walked off. Zulkarnain then communicated with “Boss” over the walkie-talkie to ask where he should go next. He was informed to head to the “usual place” which Zulkarnain assumed would be Tagore Lane.8Foot Note 8×AB417, para 4. (d) As for past dealings between the parties, Zulkarnain stated that he got to know “Boss” sometime in August 2013, when he was working as a bouncer in Boat Quay. One day, “Boss” called him, and asked if he wanted to work for “Boss”. “Boss” said that someone told him that Zulkarnain “could be trusted”, had a driver’s licence, and needed money. A week later, Zulkarnain agreed to help “Boss”, and did so  for about three to five times in total.9Foot Note 9×AB415-416, paras 2-4. 21 In the fourth long statement recorded on 25 November 2013 at 7.48pm, Zulkarnain said that: (a) He had collected items for “Boss” on six other occasions prior to the night of the drug transaction. On these occasions, Zulkarnain would rent a car ahead of time. He had rented about five or six cars in total. “Boss” instructed him on the pick-up location to collect the items. When he arrived, someone would place the items in his car. He would then meet “Boss” at Tagore Lane where “Boss” would collect the items from his car. He had never checked the items put in his car. Zulkarnain would be paid $200 to $300 for each job, and a further $500 for the car rental charges.10Foot Note 10×AB429, paras 29-30. (b) In terms of communication devices, “Boss” would give handphones to him. Sometime after he began helping “Boss”, “Boss” started giving him two handphones, instead of one handphone. One handphone was meant for communications with “Boss”, while the other was meant for communications with the other people related to the deals. He had “thrown away handphones about 3 to 4 times”. Earlier in November 2013, “Boss” gave him the blue Nokia handphone, along with a black Nokia handphone (marked as “ZK-HP4”), as well as the walkie-talkie.11Foot Note 11×AB429, para 29. 22 In the eighth long statement recorded on 4 December 2013, the following details were furnished: (a) When shown a photograph of Rizwan, he confirmed that Rizwan was “Boss”. Zulkarnain was also able to recognise “Boss’s” voice. On 20 November 2013, Zulkarnain saw “Boss” in his car when it was parked at Chin Bee Drive. He recognised “[Boss’s] black and tinted Mitsubishi”. He has never seen anyone else drive it other than “Boss”. He also recognised “Boss” because of “his big body and short hair”. Zulkarnain also knew that “Boss” was at the scene on 20 November 2013 because “Boss” spoke to him using the walkie-talkie, and he could recognise the voice of “Boss”.12Foot Note 12×AB442, paras 41. (b) Saved within the blue Nokia handphone was a contact named “Batman” with the number 9059 6581. This was the number of “Boss”, and Zulkarnain called “Boss” using the number. Apart from Batman’s number, Zulkarnain also identified the phone numbers 8401 7309 and 9051 9541 as the mobile phone numbers of “Boss”, who would use these numbers to call him. “Boss” was the only one who would contact Zulkarnain using the blue Nokia handphone, and he would only contact  “Boss” using this handphone.13Foot Note 13×AB442, paras 42. 23 In the second long statement recorded on 24 November 2013, Zulkarnain stated that on previous occasions, “Boss” told him there was “nothing dangerous” about the merchandise. “Boss” knew he would not ask much because he needed the money. Then, he admitted that “[he] guessed that this job [was] illegal, because if not, [he] would not be doing it in the middle of the night and using walkie-talkie like a secret agent.” He thought the job might involve “drugs, cigarettes or improvised items” – being Starhub modems. He wanted to stop, but decided to do the job one last time – the drug transaction – because he was “desperate for money”.14Foot Note 14×AB421, para 14.",
        "Communications records": "24 Following Zulkarnain’s arrest, a black walkie-talkie was found in his possession. A number of handphones were also seized from Zulkarnain, including the blue Nokia handphone (with the number 9083 7584). The blue Nokia handphone was sent to the CNB’s Forensic Response Team for forensic examination. From the examination report15Foot Note 15×AB107-113., there were messages and calls between Zulkarnain and the number 9059 6581 saved as “Batman”, as well as calls between the number used by Zulkarnain and the number 8401 7309 (which Zulkarnain stated was another of “Boss’s” numbers).16Foot Note 16×AB442, paras 42.I reproduce the relevant messages and calls extracted on 20 November 2013 below: SMS Text Message S/NFromToMessageDate/Time1BatmanZK-HP3Semua hp tutup semua k.. 10 min saya sampai(Translation: Allhpturn off/close allk..10minI reach17Foot Note 17×AB115.)20/11/20139:24:35 pm2ZK-HP3BatmanK20/11/201321:25:253ZK-HP3BatmanBos dah sampai(Translation: Boss has reached)21/11/201300:39:07 Call Records S/NFromToDate/TimeDuration1BatmanZK-HP320/11/201317:03:3716 seconds2BatmanZK-HP320/11/201319:44:3427 seconds3ZK-HP38401 730920/11/201320:45:05-4ZK-HP38401 730920/11/201320:45:19-5BatmanZK-HP320/11/201320:53:5227 seconds6BatmanZK-HP320/11/201321:19:5450 seconds 25 Call records from Zulkarnain’s handphone number, and the two handphone numbers identified as belonging to “Boss”, being 8401 7309 and 9059 6581, were also retrieved from Singapore Telecommunications Ltd (“Singtel”).18Foot Note 18×AB147-152, Exh P273 and AB135-146 respectively.These phone records revealed that there were various calls and messages between Zulkarnain and the numbers dating back to 31 October 2013.",
        "Evidence against Saminathan": "26 With that, I turn to the evidence adduced by the Prosecution against Saminathan. Statement of Saminathan 27 One long statement recorded by W/Insp Ng from Saminathan under s 22 of the CPC on 28 March 2014 was admitted into evidence without objections from Saminathan. In it, Saminathan said that he worked as a driver for a company known as MKG Logistics. He would deliver consignments from Malaysia into Singapore. In the course of his work, he has been to Shipyard Crescent near Pioneer Road. Save for one occasion, he drove the same lorry and trailer. He said that the lorry (not the trailer) had the registration number WER2508.19Foot Note 19×AB451, para 15. Entry and exit records 28 The Prosecution also tendered documentary evidence from the ICA, concerning the entry and exit records of Saminathan, as well as the Trailer, which showed that: (a) On 20 November 2013, Saminathan entered and left Singapore twice using his passport with the number A28724303. The first entry was at 8.24am, with the exit at 10.32am. More significantly, there was a second entry at 6.40pm, with the exit at 10.18pm from the Tuas Checkpoint. I shall refer to these as “the travel movement records”.20Foot Note 20×AB474. (b) The vehicle records showed that for the entry at 6.40pm and the exit at 10.18pm, Saminathan was the Trailer’s only occupant,ie,the driver.21Foot Note 21×AB475. (c) For the entry at 6.40pm, an image of a duly completed disembarkation card (“the disembarkation card”) was produced.22Foot Note 22×Exh P278, p 3.This document contained Saminathan’s name and signature, vehicle registration number “WER2508”, and stated the address in Singapore to be “SHIPYArD Rd”. (d) For the exit at 10.18pm, an image of Saminathan’s passport (duly captured for the exit) was produced.23Foot Note 23×Exh P278, p 4 29 Through the entry and exit records, the Prosecution sought to show that Saminathan was in Singapore from 6.40pm to 10.18pm, and was the driver of the Trailer who had transferred the bundles from the Trailer into Zulkarnain’s car on 20 November 2013, and who had then left in the Trailer for Malaysia. Evidence of ICA officer 30 ICA officer SSgt Goh Cheow Siang (“SSgt Goh”) gave evidence that he was the officer on duty at Tuas Checkpoint who processed the exit of the Trailer on the night of 20 November 2013. He explained the verification protocol that he applied, including his observation of distinguishing features that he would have noticed while inspecting Saminathan’s passport photo. There was nothing for him to suspect that Saminathan was not the person who presented Saminathan’s passport when the Trailer exited Singapore.24Foot Note 24×Notes of Evidence (“NEs”), 13 September 2016, p 56 lines 21 to 31 and p 57 lines 4 to 6. Evidence from Saminathan’s former employer 31 A statement of Saminathan’s former employer, Mr Murugan a/l Silvarajoo (“Murugan”) was admitted by consent under s 32(1)(k) of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed).25Foot Note 25×Exh P274.According to Murugan, the Trailer had been assigned to Saminathan since he started working for MKG Logistics. Each driver would be assigned a specific trailer, could park his assigned trailer near his home, and would have to take care of it. Likewise, Saminathan was given exclusive possession of the Trailer. On 20 November 2013, Saminathan was only instructed to make one delivery of mineral water from Malaysia to Chin Bee Drive in Singapore in the morning. Then, on 21 November 2013, when Murugan contacted Saminathan for a fresh delivery, he found out that Saminathan had gone back to his hometown. Murugan scolded him for taking leave without informing him, and without returning the keys to the Trailer. In fact, Saminathan missed work from then until 27 November 2013. During that period, Saminathan had the keys to the Trailer with him. DNA analysis 32 Finally, HSA analysis revealed that Saminathan’s DNA was found on two of the 35 bundles containing the drugs, namely bundles “A1A9” and “B1A6”. The analyst from HSA, Ms Tang Sheau Wei June (“Ms Tang”), gave evidence as follows: (a) Saminathan’s DNA was found on “AREA 1” and “AREA 4” of bundle B1A6. “AREA 1” was the exterior surface area of the taped bundle. “AREA 4” was the total surface area of the non-adhesive side of the black tapes, which were laid out after the taped bundle was dismantled;26Foot Note 26×NEs, 7 September 2016, page 25 lines 1-9.and (b) For bundle A1A9, Saminathan’s DNA was found on “AREA 4”, but not “AREA-1”. Again, “AREA-4” was the total surface area of the non-adhesive side of the black tapes, which were laid out after dismantling the tapes of the bundle, while “AREA-1” was the exterior surface area of the taped bundle. Ms Tang testified that “since there were no DNA obtained from AREA 1, [it was] most likely that the DNA [in respect of AREA 4] would have been on the areas that were covered by the tapes”.27Foot Note 27×NEs, 7 September 2016, page 50 lines 22-23",
        "Close of the Prosecution’s case": "33 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence against each of the accused persons and called upon them to give evidence in their own defence.",
        "Zulkarnain’s defence": "34 Zulkarnain’s evidence was consistent with the contents of the statements, as summarised at [19]—[23] above. He did not seriously dispute that he was in possession of the 35 bundles containing the drugs. Consistent with his position in the statements, he claimed that he did not know that the drugs were diamorphine, save that they could be illegal items, including drugs.",
        "Rizwan’s defence": "35 Rizwan denied any involvement in the drug transaction. He claimed that he was not the driver of the black Mitsubishi. According to him, he had loaned his car to one “Uncle”, who was a male Malay whom he had known since September 2013, on 20 November 2013, for $300. He had lent “Uncle” his car before, and was told by “Uncle” that he needed it for personal reasons. To hand over the car, Rizwan would leave his car key in a pouch in the car, and leave the car unlocked. 36 That night, Rizwan left his home at about 9pm because “Uncle” told him that something had happened to his car earlier that evening and instructed Rizwan to leave his home. Rizwan took a taxi to Boat Quay, and arrived there at about 10pm where he met some friends, including one Khairul Famy bin Mohd Samsudin (“Khairul”). 37 He stayed at Boat Quay until about 3am to 4am, when he learned from “Uncle” that his car was involved in a drug case. On “Uncle’s” further instructions, Rizwan went to stay in a flat in Yishun for two nights. Then, he left Singapore for Malaysia. He did so by hiding in the boot of a car because he did not have his passport with him. In doing all these, he was merely following “Uncle’s” instructions. He felt betrayed by “Uncle” as he had trusted him. 38 As for Zulkarnain’s evidence against Rizwan, his defence was that Zulkarnain was lying when he implicated Rizwan. Zulkarnain had associated Rizwan with the black Mitsubishi because Zulkarnain had seen Rizwan with that car on previous occasions at Boat Quay. To support his defence that he was not at the scene at the time of the drug transaction, Rizwan called Khairul as a witness. 39 At this juncture, I should add that the Prosecution introduced three long statements recorded by W/Insp Ng under s 22 of the CPC for the purpose of cross-examining Rizwan on inconsistencies between his testimony and those statements. Rizwan did not object to the admissibility of these statements, and these were admitted into evidence accordingly for cross-examination by the Prosecution. I will deal with this in [74] below.",
        "Saminathan’s defence": "40 Saminathan said that on the morning of 20 November 2013, he drove the Trailer into Singapore to deliver a consignment of mineral water at Chin Bee Drive. After that, he went back to his mother’s home in Tampin, Negeri Sembilan. Before doing so, he left the Trailer at the office, and returned the keys to the Trailer. 41 Usually, after completing his assigned delivery, he would park the Trailer at the office of MKG Logistics, and would return the keys of the Trailer to Murugan, Murugan’s wife or to the office. He did not have permission to take the Trailer with him elsewhere. Once or twice, Saminathan might have forgotten to return the keys of the Trailer. However, the boss, Murugan, had a spare key. He had never kept the Trailer with him after a job before. 42 Saminathan claimed that he was not the person who drove the Trailer into Singapore that night, or the person involved in the drug transaction. When he did not have any work to do, he would place his passport in the Trailer.28Foot Note 28×NEs, 21 September 2016, p 38, lines 8-17With regards to the disembarkation card, he explained that it was his practice to leave “a few white cards with [his] details”, pre-filled and pre-signed, in the Trailer. He would only leave the portion stating “Address in Singapore” blank, and would fill this portion up when he needed to make a delivery based on the delivery address. Therefore, in respect of the disembarkation card, Saminathan disputed that the words “SHIPYArD RD” under the section “Address in Singapore” were written by him. However, he agreed that the rest of the details in the disembarkation card were pre-filled by him, and that he signed it.29Foot Note 29×NEs, 21 September 2016, p 37, lines 11-30, and p 38, lines 1-4.According to Saminathan, someone else could have used his passport, the disembarkation card and the Trailer to enter Singapore, and to carry out the drug transaction. 43 I should add that the Prosecution introduced a long statement recorded from Saminathan on 31 March 2014 by W/Insp Ng under s 22 of the CPC, so as to cross-examine Saminathan on the inconsistencies between the contents of this statement and his testimony. I will return to this from [102] onwards.",
        "Handwriting experts": "44 As Saminathan claimed that he did not write the words “SHIPYArD RD” on the disembarkation card, the Prosecution applied to call a handwriting expert, Dr Nellie Cheng (“Dr Cheng”) from the HSA, as a rebuttal witness to test Saminathan’s claim. I allowed the Prosecution’s application. Subsequently, to respond to Dr Cheng’s opinion, Saminathan also applied to call a handwriting expert, Mr Pang Chan Kok William (“Mr Pang”), which I also allowed. 45 In Dr Cheng’s first report dated 23 September 2016, she concluded that the possibility that Saminathan was the writer of “SHIPYArD RD” in the disembarkation card in question “cannot be ruled out”.30Foot Note 30×Exh D3-3.In response, , Mr Pang, in his first report of 11 January 2017, did not render any conclusion on the writer of the phrase, explaining that there was “insufficient quantity” and that “the questioned and collected handwriting specimen” were of “poor quality”.31Foot Note 31×Exh D3-1.Given Mr Pang’s views, further handwriting specimens were collected from Saminathan, and furnished to both  experts for consideration. Both experts then furnished a second report each. 46 Thereafter, in her second report dated 28 February 2017, Dr Cheng maintained her view that the possibility that Saminathan was the writer of “SHIPYArD RD” cannot be ruled out.32Foot Note 32×Exh P289.Under rigorous cross-examination by Saminathan’s counsel, Dr Cheng explained and defended her position. Meanwhile, in Mr Pang, in his second report dated 25 August 2017, came to the finding that Saminathan wasnotthe writer of the words “SHIPYArD RD”.33Foot Note 33×Exh D3-2.However, in court, Mr Pang retracted this position by stating that he wished to expunge the relevant paragraph, being paragraph 6, of the second report.34Foot Note 34×NEs, 6 September 2017, lines 1-23.",
        "Decision on conviction": "47 With that, I proceed to state the law applicable to the charge against each of the accused persons, to analyse the relevant evidence and to state my findings.",
        "Zulkarnain": "115 Having heard the parties’ submissions, I found on a balance of probabilities that Zulkarnain’s role in the drug transaction was to collect the drugs and then to deliver the drugs to Rizwan. His acts fell within the acts of a courierunder s 33B(2)(a)(i) of the MDA. The PP had also issued Zulkarnain with a certificate of substantive assistance. 116 On the facts of this case, I saw no reason to impose the death penalty, nor did the Prosecution submit that there was any such reason. Accordingly, I imposed the alternative sentence of life imprisonment (backdated to the date of his arrest on 20 November 2013). As Zulkarnain was more than 50 years old, by s 325 of the CPC, he was not liable for caning.",
        "Rizwan": "117 The Prosecution submitted that Rizwan was not a courier. I agreed with the Prosecution that Rizwan’s role went beyond that of a courier. Apart from getting Zulkarnain to carry out the drug transaction, he had also coordinated the drug transaction. As for the second requirement, the PP did not issue a certificate of substantive assistance. Accordingly, I passed the mandatory death sentence on him.",
        "Saminathan": "118 As for Saminathan, it was clear on the evidence that his role was to deliver the drugs to Zulkarnain (which he did).

There is an alternative sentencing regime in 33B(1)(a) of the MDA allowing the court the discretion to impose a mandatory term of imprisonment for life and 15 strokes of the cane. 114 For a court to have the discretion to impose the alternative sentence, an offender must show that his acts fell within s 33(B)(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA and must also receive a certificate of substantive assistance from the PP. The decision to give or withhold such a certificate is at the sole discretion of the PP: s 33(B)(4) of the MDA."
