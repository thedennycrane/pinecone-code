        "The defendant’s conduct in these proceedings": "17     The defendant had, until it filed its defence and counterclaim, admitted that it was indebted to the plaintiff. In the pre-defence stages, its primary interest was to obtain court approval for the vessel to be sold to Hao Yun. 18     To this end, its solicitors wrote to the plaintiff’s solicitors to state that the plaintiff’s mortgage claim would be settled. The defendant went further and exhibited an executed deed of agreement between itself and Hao Yun, whereby subject to the approval of the court, Hao Yun was to buy the vessel by paying “all monies owing by [the defendant] to the Plaintiff in Admiralty in Rem No. 412 of 2007” and making a further payment to the defendant. 19     These were representations to the plaintiff and the court that the plaintiff’s claim would be paid upon the sale of the vessel to Hao Yun. There was no qualification over the amount to be paid. Although the final amount was not fixed because of accumulating interest charges payable, it was disclosed in the claim indorsed in the writ of summons that the sum was TK. 12,82,37,657.00 as at 19 August 2007. 20     In the event, the sale to Hao Yun was not approved, and the plaintiff continued with its claim. At that stage, the defendant changed course and contended that it was not indebted to the plaintiff at all because the plaintiff had allegedly waived its rights or is estopped from exercising them. 21     The matters on which the defences of waiver and estoppel were based were within the defendant’s knowledge at all times. Why were they not raised earlier, and why were representations made to the plaintiff and the court that the plaintiff’s claim would be settled and paid if the sale to Hao Yun was approved? No reason was offered by the defendant. These representations made to the plaintiff would have raised serious questions over the merits of the defence. When those representations were made to the court to seek approval for the sale of the vessel, and an inconsistent and contradictory position was taken in the defence and counterclaim, the defendant’s conduct may amount to an abuse of process.",
        "Abuse of process": "22     InJohnson v Gore Wood & Co (a firm)[2002] 2 AC 1, a decision of the House of Lords, Lord Bingham of Cornhill held at 31: The bringing of a claim or the raising of a defence in later proceedings may, without more, amount to abuse if the court is satisfied (the onus being on the party alleging abuse) that the claim or defence should have been raised in the earlier proceedings if it was to be raised at all. and he went on to elaborate that in deciding whether there is abuse, the judgment made should be: a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before. This was endorsed by the other Law Lords in that case, and applied in Singapore by the Court of Appeal inLai Swee Lin Linda v Attorney-General[2006] 2 SLR 563. 23     InGoh Nellie v Goh Lian Teck and Others[2007] 1 SLR 453(“Nellie Goh”), Sundaresh Menon JC aptly stated at [53], the position to be that: a court should determine whether there is an abuse of process by looking at all the circumstances of the case, including whether the later proceedings in substance is nothing more than a collateral attack upon the previous decision; whether there is fresh evidence that might warrant re-litigation; whether there arebona fidereasons why an issue that ought to have been raised in the earlier action was not; and whether there are some other special circumstances that might justify allowing the case to proceed. The absence or existence of these enumerated factors (which are not intended to be exhaustive) is not decisive. In determining whether the ambient circumstances of the case give rise to an abuse of process, the court should not adopt an inflexible or unyielding attitude but should remain guided by the balance to be found in the tension between the demands of ensuring that a litigant who has a genuine claim is allowed to press his case in court and recognising that there is a point beyond which repeated litigation would be unduly oppressive to the defendant. 24     In the present case, the defendant did not raise the defences of waiver and estoppel which should have been raised before Choo J and Ang J, and went further to admit the plaintiff’s claim and negotiate a sale of the vessel to Hao Yun which ensured that the plaintiff’s claim was satisfied. 25     The law is not so rigid and absolute as to deny the defendant any opportunity to raise those defences now, if there are valid reasons for not raising them earlier. But the defendant had not brought out any reasons for reversing its position. Any circumstances and evidence that support the defences of waiver and estoppel would have existed before the plaintiff filed this action. The forced sale of a vessel is a catastrophic prospect to confront a shipowner. A reasonable shipowner would consider the validity of the arrest. Here, the defendant did not raise any issue against the arrest, and sought to arrange for the plaintiff’s claim to be paid out of the sale proceeds. 26     Against this backdrop, was the raising of waiver and estoppel an abuse of process? The principal factors to be considered are: (i)     they were matters that could have been brought up at the outset of the proceedings, but were not; (ii)    the defendant had not only kept silent on waiver and estoppel, but had admitted to be indebted to the plaintiff; (iii)  the defendant’s reliance on the plaintiff’s acceptance of late payments to raise the defences of waiver and estoppel ignored the fact that the plaintiff did not recall the loans because the defendant was late in payment, but because the vessel was arrested by the interveners; and (iv)   the defendant had offered no explanation for the change from unqualified admission to total denial. 27     In the absence of any valid reasons, I found that the defendant’s plea of waiver and estoppel was an abuse of process. 28     What is the effect of a defence pleaded in abuse of process? Abuse of process of this magnitude comes within the doctrine ofres judicata. As Menon JC highlighted inNellie Gohat [17]–[19],res judicatatakes the form of cause of action estoppel, issue estoppel and abuse of process. 29     In the present case, the legality of the arrest was not the issue before Choo J and Ang J, nor was waiver and estoppel brought up as issues before them. The first two forms ofres judicatadid not apply on these facts. However, the circumstances in which the defendant’s raising of the defences of waiver and estoppel were so unsatisfactory that they came within the third form ofres judicata. 30     It followed that the defendant’s pleas of waiver and estoppel cannot be maintained as these matters areres judicata. The counterclaim founded on unlawful arrest because of the alleged waiver and estoppel was similarly defective. Consequently, summary judgment was entered in favour of the plaintiff, and the counterclaim was struck out. _________________ [note: 1]Affidavit of evidence-in-chief of Abdul Hasan Md.
