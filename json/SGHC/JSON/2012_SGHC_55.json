        "The parties’ main arguments": "5       At the hearing, copious\n                    arguments were canvassed. I do not propose to go further\n                    than to summarise the main arguments put forth by both\n                    parties. 6       The Plaintiffs contend that\n                    their claim is established by the aggregation of separate\n                    but continuous periods of adverse possession by the various\n                    parties who owned Lot 389P from the year 1964 onwards.\n                    They aver that the law recognises that a person can transfer\n                    rights in respect of land under his or her adverse\n                    possession to a successor possessor of the land, whether by\n                    sale, gift or any other manner of disposition. 7       On the facts of the present\n                    case, the Plaintiffs suggest that 12 years adverse\n                    possession necessary to give rise to a valid claim against\n                    the Defendant commenced either in 1976 (taking reference\n                    from the time Kew Carey allegedly asserted adverse\n                    possession over Plot D by erecting the mesh-wire\n                    boundary fence around it) or, at the latest, in 1989 (taking\n                    reference from the time the septic tank was removed from\n                    Plot D in or around 1976 to 1977). In the later case,\n                    the Plaintiffs claim that all restrictive covenants, rights\n                    and liberties in connection with the maintenance of the\n                    septic tank in Plot D would have ceased to operate with\n                    the consequence that any continuing possession of\n                    Plot D by the owners of Lot 389P thereafter could\n                    only amount to adverse possession. 8       In either of the two cases,\n                    the requisite 12 years of adverse possession would have\n                    crystallised before the abolition of the doctrine of adverse\n                    possession on 1 March 1994 and the conversion of\n                    Lot 388V (comprising Plot D) to registered land on\n                    29 November 2001. In this last regard, the Plaintiffs\n                    added that possessory title to Plot D, which they\n                    allegedly acquired upon their purchase of Lot 389P on\n                    29 October 2001, was preserved by Caveat No IB/277242H\n                    (“the Caveat”), which they had lodged against\n                    Lot 388V on 4 February 2009. 9       The Defendant, on the other\n                    hand, argues that adverse possession is not made out in the\n                    present case for a host of reasons. Firstly, the Defendant\n                    claims that Kew Carey’s possession of Plot D\n                    after the Deceased’s conveyance of Lot 389P to\n                    her on 3 February 1964 was permissive and not adverse.\n                    The basis for this contention can be found in paras 21\n                    and 23 of the Defendant’s written submissions: 21.The Defendant’s main\n                            defence to the action is that the Conveyance of\n                            Lot 389P … by the Deceased to Kew Carey\n                            granting her right of entry into, laying underground\n                            sewer and drainage pipes in, and to use and maintain\n                            the septic tank and disposal plant in the\n                            Deceased’s land Lot 388V, in return for\n                            restrictive covenants, constitutes written license\n                            or permission to Kew Carey and her successors in\n                            title to enter, remain and make use of the\n                            Lot 388V. … the relevant grant of right\n                            and the restrictive covenants expressly [intended]\n                            that both the benefit of the right and the burden\n                            should pass and bind the successors and assigns of\n                            the respective parties. The right to enter is\n                            express, and if not, is certainly implied. The grant\n                            of entry in the Conveyance is not limited for any\n                            duration. … 23.The Defence submits that the\n                            license to enter and use the land in a Deed of\n                            Conveyance would remain valid until discharged by\n                            the parties concerned or their assigns in a deed. In\n                            the premises any entry and occupation of\n                            Lot 388V at any time by any of the owners of\n                            Lot 38[9]P, was permissive, by license of the\n                            owner of Lot 388[V] and no action for trespass\n                            could lie, nor any adverse possession could commence\n                            for reckoning time running against the Deceased\n                            under the Limitation Act. Further, any entry to\n                            possession that commences under license/permission\n                            can never later change to an adverse\n                            possession. 10     The Defendant further adds\n                    that where possession of a piece of land at its inception is\n                    permissive, there must be strong proof ofanimus possidendibefore permissive\n                    possession may be successfully converted into adverse\n                    possession. In other words, evidence must be led of conduct\n                    demonstrating an overt intent to oust the true owner of the\n                    land to the latter’s knowledge. That being the state\n                    of law as contended by the Defendant, the Defendant argued\n                    that the Plaintiffs’ claim must fail because: (a)     Kew\n                        Carey’s act of erecting the mesh-wire boundary\n                        fence in 1964 was “by itself not determinative of\n                        ouster, [let] alone being overt”;\n                    and (b)     Apart from the fence, there was no other\n                        assertion of adverse title by any of the previous owners\n                        of Lot 389P to the knowledge of the\n                        Deceased. 11     Secondly, the Defendant\n                    challenges the Plaintiffs’ claim that possession by\n                    the various owners of Lot 389P and Plot D from\n                    1964 onwards was continuous and unbroken. He does this by\n                    contending that, as a matter of law, no right of adverse\n                    possession is transferrable under a mortgagee’s\n                    exercise of its power of sale. The Defendant further argues\n                    that: 41.Pacific Steel sold\n                            Lot 389P to Poh Wee Lee and Ong Ah Keah on 17th\n                            September 1984. The joint owners were second-hand\n                            car dealers and appear on evidence for the\n                            Plaintiffs to have used the property to station\n                            their cars. The owners were not called as witnesses\n                            and there is no evidence if they were aware of the\n                            separate Lot 388V, if they intended to acquire\n                            adverse title to oust the true owner andfor how long they abandoned possession\n                                of the entire property before their mortgagee\n                                bank OCBC’s forced sale of\n                                [Lot 389P]. The burden of proof of adverse\n                                possession, and its continuity, if any, is on\n                                the claimant Plaintiffs. The evidence in cross\n                                examination of Tng Chin Kok on his visit to\n                                inspect [Lot 389P] prior to his purchase\n                                from OCBC establishes a long time abandonment of\n                                the premises by the mortgagor\n                                debtors.There is no evidence of\n                            operative adverse possession or its continuity\n                            during the long period of ownership by Poh Wee Lee\n                            and Ong Ah Keah, for 6 years, from 1984 to 1990. The\n                            long break in the continuity is very\n                        clear. [emphasis added] 12     Thirdly, the Defendant\n                    submits that as a matter of law when registered land is\n                    mortgaged, any periods of adverse possession accumulated by\n                    the predecessors-in-title of that registered land do not\n                    pass on to the mortgagee. As such, contrary to the\n                    Plaintiffs’ contentions, OCBC Bank’s sale of\n                    Lot 389P to Tng Chin Kok and Lee Ming Lee in 1990 could\n                    not have conveyed any right arising from an earlier adverse\n                    possession of Plot D. Taking the Defendant’s\n                    argument to its logical conclusion, this would also mean\n                    that a conveyance of title under a mortgagee’s power\n                    of sale (ie, Keppel TatLee\n                    Bank Ltd) would not entail the conveyance of anycrystallisedtitle to a neighbouring\n                    property which was acquired by adverse possession.\n                    Accordingly, the Plaintiffs could not have acquired any good\n                    claim of adverse possession against Plot D when keppel\n                    TatLee Bank Ltd transferred Lot 389P to them on\n                    29 October 2001. 13     Finally, the Defendant\n                    raises a secondary defence that the Plaintiffs ought to have\n                    lodged the Caveat before end November 2006 (ie, five years from the date\n                    Lot 388V was converted to registered land in November\n                    2001). The basis for this, according to the Defendant, is\n                    found in ss 19(2) and (3) of the repealed Land Titles\n                    Act (Cap 157, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the 1985\n                    LTA”): 19.— (1) Upon the\n                        issue of a qualified certificate of title the Registrar\n                        shall endorse on the relevant folio of the land-register\n                        a caution warning persons dealing with the proprietor\n                        that the land therein comprised is held subject to any\n                        interest which affected it at the date of issue of the\n                        qualified certificate of title, and so long as the\n                        caution remains on the folio the land shall be so\n                        held. (2)In favour\n                                of any purchaser from the proprietor, a caution\n                                lapses at the expiration of 5 years from the\n                                date of issue of the qualified certificate of\n                                title, and the purchaser may request the\n                                Registrar to enter on the folio of the\n                                land-register a notification of the\n                                lapsing. (3)    When the lapsing of a caution\n                            has been notified on the folio of the land-register,\n                            the certificate of title ceases to be qualified, and\n                            the land therein comprised is thenceforth held\n                            subject only to such interests as are registered or\n                            notified on the folio of the land-register and to\n                            such interests as are otherwise excepted by section\n                            38. … [emphasis added] As can be seen from the wording of the provisions,\n                    once a caution has lapsed the registered land ceases to be\n                    subject to any interest other than those reflected on the\n                    register at that point in time. However, the Caveat\n                    reflecting the Plaintiffs’ interest in Plot D was\n                    only lodged on 4 February 2009. According to the\n                    Defendant, by this time the Plaintiffs had lost any alleged\n                    interest they had in Plot D.",

        "Kew Carey’s possession of Plot D –\n                permissive or adverse?": "16     In Kevin Gray and Susan\n                    Francis Gray,Elements of Land\n                        Law(Oxford University Press, 5th Ed, 2009)\n                        (“Gray and\n                    Gray”) at para 9.1.43, the meaning of\n                    adverse possession was explained as follows: … the element of possessory control required of\n                        any successful squatter is constituted by a distinctive\n                        combination of elements. ‘Possession’ is\n                        attributed to the squatter (and his possession is\n                        ‘adverse’) only if he has both factual\n                        possession (factumpossessionis) and the requisite\n                        intention to possess (animus\n                            possidendi). These elements offactumandanimusinteract significantly and must\n                        coincide continuously throughout the entirety of the\n                        required period of possession. … 17     As to what constitutes ananimus possidendisufficient to support a finding of adverse possession, the\n                    Plaintiffs quoted (rather economically) from Charles Harpumet al,The Law of Real Property by Megarry and Wade(Sweet & Maxwell, 7th Ed, 2008) at\n                    para 35–019 for support: (2)animus\n                                possidendi.The squatter must have ‘an\n                            intention for the time being to possess the land to\n                            the exclusion of all other persons, including the\n                            owner with the paper title’. As regards that\n                            intention: (i)It is\n                                    an intention to possess and not an intention\n                                    to own. … (iii)It\n                                    is an intention to possess and not an\n                                    intention to dispossess. Accordingly, the\n                                    animus can be sufficiently established even\n                                    if both the true owner and the squatter\n                                    mistakenly believe that the land belongs to\n                                    the latter, or where a squatter did not\n                                    realise that he was trespassing on\n                                    another’s\n                            land. … [emphasis added in bold italics] 18     On the same point, I also\n                    foundGray and Grayat\n                    para 9.1.53 to be of some useful guidance in the\n                    present action: … This mental element has been said to comprise\n                        an ‘intention, in one’s own name and on\n                        one’s own behalf, to exclude the world at large,\n                        including the owner with the paper title if he be not\n                        himself the possessor, so far as is reasonably\n                        practicable and so far as the processes of the law will\n                        allow’. The necessary intent is, of course,\n                        heavily qualified by the reality that, until his\n                        possessory title is perfected, the squatter’s\n                        ability to excludeallpersons from the land is inevitably limited.In recent years, however, the relevant\n                            animus seems to have been commuted into little more\n                            than an intention on the part of the squatter to\n                            ‘stay as long as he can for his own\n                            benefit’. There need be no intention to own,\n                            or acquire an estate in, the land.Ironically, the modern relaxation of the requirements of\n                        adverse possession has emerged at just the point in time\n                        when, by virtue of the changes effected by the Land\n                        Registration Act 2002, the acquisition of title by long\n                        possession appears likely to become a relatively unusual\n                        occurrence in English law.

The Defendant claimed that the Indenture\n                    of Conveyance dated 3 February 1964 gave rise to a\n                    licence under which Kew Carey was authorised by the Deceased\n                    to enter Lot 388V for the purpose of maintaining the\n                    septic tank which was then kept in the part of Lot 388V\n                    which later came to be referred to as Plot D. It was on\n                    this premise that the Defendant contended that the requisiteanimus possidendiin the\n                    present case should be held to a higher standard,viz, adverse possession would only\n                    be made out in the present case where the adverse possessor\n                    has an overt intent to oust the true owner of the land by\n                    way of asserting adverse title to the property to the\n                    knowledge of the true owner (see[9]–[10]above). 20     It is not in dispute that\n                    Kew Carey came into possession of Plot D after she\n                    built the mesh-wire boundary fence around the premises. The\n                    question is thus whether such possession was permissive or\n                    adverse in nature. 21     I accept that the\n                    Indenture of Conveyance dated 3 February 1964 did in\n                    fact give rise to a licence in favour of Kew Carey toenterLot 388V for\n                    the narrow purposes stipulated in the Schedule to the\n                    Indenture of Conveyance which stated: THE\n                            SCHEDULE ABOVE REFERRED TO … TOGETHER with full and free right and liberty for the\n                        Sub-Purchaser his executors administrators and assigns\n                        the owners and occupiers for the time being of the said\n                        land and premises his and their tenants and servants and\n                        all other persons authorized by him or them in common\n                        with the [Deceased] and all persons from time to time\n                        having the like right and liberty to make all necessary\n                        connections to and thereafter to use the pipes and\n                        cables under or over the Estate for the purpose of the\n                        supply of water gas and electricity to or from the said\n                        land and premises and to make all necessary connections\n                        to the septic tank and disposal plant constructed by the\n                        [Deceased] on the land edged ‘blue’ on the\n                        plan annexed hereto and marked as Lot 23-150 pt. of\n                        Mukim XXVIII containing an area of 2,035 square feet\n                        (subject to the adjoining owner for the time being known\n                        as Private Lot 12 making use of the said pipes and\n                        septic tank the cost being shared in equal proportion\n                        with the said adjoining owner for the time being making\n                        use of the said pipes and septic tank) Reserving\n                        Nevertheless to the [Deceased] and to all others to whom\n                        the [Deceased] may grant or has already granted the same\n                        similar rights of drainage and the right to construct\n                        lay and use any drains pipes or cables under the said\n                        land and premises which the [Deceased] may consider\n                        necessary for the purpose of serving other pieces or\n                        parcels of land forming part of the Estate and to make\n                        all necessary connections thereto. … 22     However, I am unable to\n                    accept that the Deceased by the terms of the licence further\n                    permitted Kew Carey tooccupyany part of the premises in Lot 388V as nothing in the\n                    Schedule reproduced above indicated so. Indeed, nothing in\n                    the Indenture of Conveyance or its Schedule conferred\n                    exclusive possession of Plot D to Kew Carey. This meant\n                    that mere access to Lot 388V was granted by the\n                    Deceased to Kew Carey at the material time. As such,\n                    permissive possession of Plot D as contended by the\n                    Defendant is not made out in the present case. 23     In the circumstances, any\n                    possession of Plot D asserted by Kew Carey must\n                    therefore be adverse in nature, and I find that the elements\n                    of adverse possession in respect of Plot D were present\n                    at the material time. Factual possession (orfactumpossessionis) has been held to comprise a\n                    “complete and exclusive physical control” over\n                    the land in question: seeBuckinghamshire\n                        County Council v Moran[1990]\n                    1 Ch 623 at 641 (“Buckinghamshire CC v Moran”);J APye (Oxford) Ltd v Graham[2003]\n                    1 AC 419 at [41]. InBuckinghamshire\n                        CC v Moranat 641–642, Slade LJ\n                    held: As a number of authorities indicate, enclosure by\n                        itself prima facie indicates the requisite animus\n                        possidendi. As Cockburn C.J. said inSeddon v. Smith(1877) 36 L.T. 168, 169:\n                        ‘Enclosure is the strongest possible evidence of\n                        adverse possession.’ Russell L.J. inGeorge Wimpey & Co. Ltd. v.\n                            Sohn[1967] Ch. 487, 511A, similarly\n                        observed: ‘Ordinarily, of course, enclosure is the\n                        most cogent evidence of adverse possession and of\n                        dispossession of the true owner.’ While\n                        Mr. Douglas pointed out that the plot was always\n                        accessible from the north where no boundary demarcation\n                        existed, it was only accessible from the defendant's own\n                        property, Dolphin Place. In my judgment, therefore, he\n                        must be treated as having enclosed it. Mr. Douglas, however, submitted that even\n                        if enclosure had occurred, the defendant’s\n                        intention must be assessed in the light of the\n                        particular circumstances of this case. The defendant\n                        knew that the council had acquired and retained the plot\n                        with the specific intention of building a road across it\n                        at some future time. The council had no use for the land\n                        in the interim. It was for all practical purposes waste\n                        land. None of the defendant's acts, he submitted, were\n                        inconsistent with the council’s known future\n                        intentions. He invoked, inter alia, the words of\n                        Cockburn C.J. inLeigh v.\n                            Jack, 5 Ex.D. 264, 271, which, he\n                        submitted, applied in the present case: ‘I do not think that any of the\n                            defendant’s acts were done with the view of\n                            defeating the purpose of the parties to the\n                            conveyances; his acts were those of a man who did\n                            not intend to be a trespasser, or to infringe upon\n                            another’s right. The defendant simply used the\n                            land until the time should come for carrying out the\n                            object originally contemplated.’ If the defendant had stopped short of\n                        placing a new lock and chain on the gate, I might\n                        perhaps have felt able to accept these submissions. Mr.\n                        Douglas submitted that this act did not unequivocally\n                        show an intention to exclude the council as well as\n                        other people. (It is well established that it is no use\n                        for an alleged adverse possessor to rely on acts which\n                        are merely equivocal as regards the intention to exclude\n                        the true owner: see for exampleTecbild Ltd. v. Chamberlain, 20 P. &\n                        C.R. 633, 642,perSachs L.J.) In my judgment,\n                        however, the placing of the new lock and chain and gate\n                        did amount to a final unequivocal demonstration of the\n                        defendant’s intention to possess the land. I agree\n                        with the judge in his saying (1988) 86 L.G.R. 472,\n                        479: ‘ ... I do not think that if the council, on\n                            making an inspection, had found the gate newly\n                            padlocked, they could have come to any conclusion\n                            other than that [the defendant] was intending to\n                            exclude everyone, including themselves, from the\n                            land.’ 24     Similarly, in our present\n                    case, in erecting the boundary fence, Kew Carey must have\n                    intended to exercise control over Plot D since nothing\n                    in the Schedule to the Indenture of Conveyance dated\n                    3 February 1964 created a licence to occupy\n                    Lot 388V or any part thereof in the first place. I am\n                    not convinced that the Deceased or any other reasonable\n                    third party, upon discovering the mesh-wire fence boundary\n                    enclosing Plot D together with Lot 389P, would\n                    have come to any conclusion other than that Kew Carey was\n                    intending to exclude everyone, including the Deceased, from\n                    Plot D. Further, it emerged in evidence that access by\n                    any third party to Plot D could only be gained via\n                    entering and passing through Lot 389P, thereby\n                    providing additional support to the conclusion that the\n                    enclosure of Plot D was exclusionary against the whole\n                    world, including the Deceased. The building of a mesh-wire\n                    boundary fence around Plot D and Lot 389P\n                    therefore demonstrated Kew Carey’s intention to\n                    possess (oranimus\n                    possidendi). Accordingly, I find that Kew Carey\n                    was in adverse possession of Plot D at the relevant\n                    time from the year 1964 onwards.",
        "Continuity in the adverse possession of Plot\n                D": "25     It is not disputed in the\n                    present case that aggregation of more than one period of\n                    adverse possession between successive adverse possessors is\n                    in law permitted. InGray and\n                        Gray([16]supra) at para 9.1.4, the\n                    authors explain: For the purpose of establishing the expiration of the\n                        limitation period in unregistered land, immediately\n                        consecutive periods of adverse possession may be\n                        aggregated: the statutory period can be accumulated by\n                        possession on the part of a series of squatters. In\n                        other words, if X (the original ‘paper\n                        owner’) is dispossessed by A, who later transfers\n                        his ‘estate, right and interest’ to B, B is\n                        then entitled to add the period of A’s adverse\n                        possession to his own in defence against any action for\n                        recovery brought by X, provided that these two periods\n                        together total at least the statutory period (ie\n                        normally 12 years). However, the adverse possession of\n                        successive squatters can operate cumulatively to\n                        extinguish a pre-existing title only if the periods of\n                        adverse possession are strictly continuous. If A\n                        abandons his adverse possession within the limitation\n                        period and, after an interval, B begins adversely to\n                        possess, B cannot ‘tack’ to his own\n                        possession the period of adverse possession earlier\n                        established by A. The break in adverse possession\n                        restores X’s title to its pristine force. The\n                        statutory period therefore starts afresh from the\n                        inception of B’s possession and B must establish\n                        the full period independently on his own behalf. 26     The authorities relied\n                    upon by the Plaintiffs are also instructive in this regard.\n                    InJubilee Electronics Pte Ltd v Tai Wah\n                        Garments and Knitting Factory Pte Ltd[1996]\n                    1 SLR(R) 352 (“Jubilee\n                        Electronics Pte Ltd”), the Court of\n                    Appeal has held at [42] that: In the light of these authorities it is clear that\n                        aggregation of separate periods of adverse possession is\n                        permitted so long as there is continuity. There should\n                        not be any break in the two or more periods of adverse\n                        possession by different persons. So long as adverse\n                        possession continues unbroken, it makes no difference\n                        who continues it. Thus, there is no merit in the point\n                        made by the plaintiffs. 27     InJubilee Electronics Pte Ltd, the Court of\n                    Appeal reached its conclusion after reviewing,inter alia, the cases ofWillis v Earl Howe[1893]\n                    2 Ch 545 (“Willis v Earl\n                        Howe”) andMulcahy\n                        v Curramore Pty Ltd[1974] 2 NSWLR 464\n                        (“Mulcahy v Curramore Pty\n                        Ltd”). InWillis v\n                        Earl Howe, Kay LJ held at 553: ... It was suggested in reply that, as the alleged\n                        brother was not really the brother ofGeorge, his taking possession formed a\n                        new departure, and that the statute would begin to run\n                        from that entry, and that the previous possession ofGeorgewas not\n                        material. The effect of that would be that if a series\n                        of occupiers, not claiming under one another, kept out\n                        the real owner for 100 years, time would only run\n                        against him from the moment when the last of such\n                        occupiers entered into possession. I am of opinion that\n                        this is not the law. A continuous adverse possession for\n                        the statutory period, though by a succession of persons\n                        not claiming under one another, does, in my opinion, bar\n                        the true owner. ... 28     InMulcahy v Curramore Pty LtdwhereWillis v Earl Howewas considered\n                    and followed, Bowen CJ stated at 476: …Where there has been a\n                            series of persons in adverse possession by virtue of\n                            successive transmissions of the inchoate possessory\n                            title for a total period of twenty years or any\n                            extended period required by the Act,\n                        s. 34 will operate to extinguish the true owner's\n                        title.

Earl Howe[[1893] 2 Ch 545];Allen v.\n                            Roughley[(1995) 94 CLR 98];Salter v.Clarke [(1904) 4 SR (NSW) 280].\n                        … [emphasis added in bold italics] 29     Returning to the facts of\n                    the present case, there were a series of owners of\n                    Lot 389P who had possession of Plot D from 1964\n                    onwards, starting from Kew Carey. Kew Carey’s\n                    possession of Plot D, as I have held, was in the nature\n                    of an adverse possession as opposed to possession by\n                    permission (see[20]–[24]above). Accordingly, the question that\n                    remains is whether the adverse possession of Plot D was\n                    continuous for at least 12 years as required by\n                law. 30     InMulcahy v Curramore Pty Ltdat 476,\n                    Bowen CJ held that continuity in adverse possession\n                    would not be made out if there was “abandonment by\n                    one adverse possessorfollowed by a break\n                        in time when the land is not in possession of some\n                        person adversely to the true owner”\n                    [emphasis added]. In the present case, the Defendant’s\n                    argument against continuity of adverse possession of\n                    Plot D for at least 12 years is two-fold. First, the\n                    Defendant argued that possession of Plot D by the\n                    various owners of Lot 389P was in the nature of a\n                    permissive rather than adverse possession. I have ruled that\n                    this point was incorrect. Second, the Defendant contended\n                    that when OCBC Bank exercised its power of sale in 1990 to\n                    convey to Tng Chin Kok and Lee Ming Lee title over\n                    Lot 389P, no rights over Plot D were transferred;\n                    likewise for Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd’s sale of\n                    Lot 389P to the Plaintiffs themselves in\n                2001. 31     It is not entirely clear\n                    why the Defendant raises the latter argument. As mentioned\n                    earlier, it is well settled that adverse possession consists\n                    of two basic elements – factual possession and theanimus possidendi(see[16]above). If the Defendant is trying to demonstrate a break in\n                    the continuity offactualpossession upon the mortgagee’s exercise of its power\n                    of sale, I would say that he is wholly misguided. The\n                    evidence shows that the boundary fence enclosing Plot D\n                    together with Lot 389P remained in place at all material\n                    times before, during and after the sales were effected in\n                    1990 and 2001. At no time during the trial was there any\n                    suggestion made to the contrary. As such, I see no reason to\n                    find that the continuity offactualpossession of Plot D was\n                    disrupted by the mortgagees’ power of sale at the\n                    relevant times. The fact that Plot D continued to be\n                    fenced off is also cogent evidence of theanimus possidendiof whoever were in\n                    possession of Plot D: see[23]and[24]above. 32     If, however, the Defendant\n                    is trying to show that, over the course of many conveyances\n                    over the years, a lapse in the transfer of the rights\n                    accruing out of adverse possession in respect of Plot D\n                    had occurred, then I would have more to say. In the fairly\n                    recent English decision ofSite\n                        Developments (Ferndown) Ltd v Cuthbury Ltd[2011] Ch 226 (“Site\n                        Developments”), a dispute on land\n                    access rights arose principally between the second claimant\n                    who was the registered proprietor of a property (referred to\n                    in the judgment as “the brown land”) and the\n                    first defendant who held title to an adjoining plot of land\n                    (referred to as “the blue land”). In that\n                    case, the action commenced by the claimants were for,inter alia, an order that\n                    the second claimant be registered as the proprietor of the\n                    blue land and an order for possession thereof, the ground\n                    being that the blue land, prior to its transfer to the first\n                    defendant, was acquired via adverse possession by the second\n                    claimant’s predecessors-in-title who, in turn,\n                    transferred their rights over the blue land to the second\n                    claimant. Before the English High Court, one of the key\n                    issues was whether the adverse possession rights in respect\n                    of the blue land had been properly passed down through a\n                    series of,inter alia,\n                    transfers and liquidation processes which had occurred.On that particular issue,\n                    Vos J found that the rights over the blue land acquired\n                    by way of adverse possession had not been properly\n                    passed. 33     In his analysis of the\n                    issue, Vos J rejected,inter\n                        alia, the argument that adverse possessory\n                    rights passed under s 62 of the Law of Property Act\n                    1925 (which is inparimateriawith\n                    our s 6 of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act\n                    (Cap 61, 1994 Rev Ed) (“CLPA”)) each\n                    time the brown land was transferred. His analysis is as\n                    follows (see [168]–[171] of his judgment): 168    In my judgment, the section 62 argument does not\n                            work.It is important to realise\n                                that we are talking here about supposed rights\n                                over a piece of adjoining land with a separate\n                                registered title. What is suggested is that,\n                                when the owner of the brown land transfers that\n                                land, he transfers with it any adverse\n                                possession rights he may have in an adjoining\n                                piece of land without making any mention of the\n                                fact that he is doing so. I will look\n                            at the matter first as a question of statutory\n                            construction, and then consider the authorities on\n                            the\n                            point. 169    Section 62(1) does not, in my judgment go far\n                            enough to achieve what Mr Dagnall has argued.\n                            The relevant words of the section are\n                        that: ‘A conveyance of land shall be deemed to\n                            include … with the land, all buildings\n                            … liberties, privileges, easements, rights,\n                            and advantages whatsoever, appertaining or reputed\n                            to appertain to the land, or any part therefore, or,\n                            at the time of conveyance, demised, occupied, or\n                            enjoyed with, or reputed or known as part or parcel\n                            of or appurtenant to the land or any part\n                            thereof.’ The question is whether these\n                            adverse possession rights can properly be regarded\n                            as liberties, rights, or advantages appertaining to\n                            the land or occupied or enjoyed with the land. The\n                            simple point, in my judgment is that they are not\n                            rights occupied or even\n                            enjoyedwith\n                            the [brown] land.\n                            They are rights in respect of an entirely different\n                            piece of land which happens to adjoin it. Even the\n                            fact that the two pieces of land have been enjoyed\n                            together, in the sense of being used for the same\n                            purpose, is not, in my judgment,\n                        enough. 170    There are three, not entirely consistent, cases\n                            that bear on this point as follows. (1)\n                                InSt Marylebone\n                                Property Co Ltd v Fairweather[1962]\n                            1 QB 498, the Court of Appeal held that\n                            the owner of a house could pass squatter’s\n                            rights to his lessee adversely to possess a shed\n                            built partly on adjoining land, when the entrance\n                            was on the owner’s land. The decision here\n                            seems to me to be clearly within the words of\n                            section 62 since the shed was indeed a\n                            ‘building … appertaining to the land\n                            … or, at the time of conveyance, occupied, or\n                            enjoyed with … the land’. (2)\n                                InFleet v\n                                Silverstein[1963] 1 OR 153,\n                            McRuer CJHC held that squatter’s rights to a\n                            strip of land adjoining a house and enjoyed with it\n                            did pass to a successor in title under the Ontario\n                            equivalent of section 62. In an ex tempore judgment,\n                            the judge simply said, at\n                            pp 15–157: ‘although I do not have to come to a\n                            definite conclusion on it, my view at present is\n                            that the conveyance of the land on which the house\n                            sat would be quite sufficient to carry with it all\n                            the rights which Mrs Osborne had and had\n                            acquired by possession or otherwise over this strip\n                            of land which was enjoyed and used as part and\n                            parcel of the property …’ That was anyway a\n                            clearer case than this, since the strip had no\n                            independent life or use to Mrs Osborne other\n                            than use alongside the house. Here the blue land\n                            could well be used separately from the brown\n                            land. (3) Finally,inKirk v\n                            Sutherland[1949] VLR 33 (which was not apparently cited\n                            in the previous decisions), Lowe J in the\n                            Supreme Court of Victoria held that an allotment\n                            holder who had acquired adverse possessory rights\n                            over an adjoining allotment by enclosing part of it\n                            into his own allotment. [sic]\n                            Lowe J said, at p 36: ‘I am clearly of the opinion that neither of\n                            these provisions help the plaintiffs.Whatever may be the scope of the words\n                                used, the words ‘rights powers and\n                                privileges’ ‘belonging or\n                                appertaining’ to the estate or interest of\n                                the proprietor, they cannot be construed as\n                                extending to rights acquired by adverse\n                                possession in land in another certificate of\n                                title registered under the Transfer of Land Act.\n                                Nor do I think that section 62 of the Property\n                                Law Act 1928 … is of any avail to the\n                                plaintiffs. It cannot be contended that what\n                                Robert Hawley enjoyed comes within\n                                ‘liberties privileges [or]\n                                easements’.

These words\n                                are not appropriate to describe land itself, and\n                                in my opinion, do not include\n                            it.’ 171    In my opinion, the more\n                            carefully reasoned reserved decision\n                                inKirk’scase is to be\n                            preferred to the ex tempore decision\n                                inFleet’scase. Moreover,\n                            this case is even stronger than the facts\n                                inKirk’scase, since the\n                            brown land and the blue land are separate plots in\n                            separate titles, and though the brown land is\n                            bigger, the blue land is not just a strip adjoining\n                            the brown land; it is a plot in its own\n                            right.

In agreement with\n                    Vos J as to the effect of s 62 of the Law of\n                    Property Act 1925 (which is inparimateriawith\n                    s 6 of the CLPA), I hold that the mortgagees’\n                    sale of Lot 389P in 1990 and 2001 did not as such\n                    transfer to the purchasers any adverse possessory rights in\n                    respect of Plot D. I further add that there was no\n                    evidence adduced by the Plaintiffs to show that each and\n                    every one of the conveyances in respect of Lot 389P\n                    over years was made expressly to include the transfer of\n                    rights in respect of Plot D (contra\n                        Buckinghamshire CC v Moran([23]supra)). 36     Nevertheless, I find that\n                    by continuity of possession, albeit by successive owners of\n                    Lot 389P, the Plaintiffs acquired adverse possessory\n                    rights over Plot D (seeJubilee\n                        Electronics Pte Ltd([26]supra). I should perhaps add,\n                    for completeness, that the Plaintiffs’ rights are\n                    unaffected by the abolition of the doctrine of adverse\n                    possession in Singapore with effect from 1 March 1994.\n                    InBalwant Singh v Double\n                        L & T Pte Ltd[1996]\n                    2 SLR(R) 7, the Court of Appeal reviewed the\n                    effect of the repeal of the Land Titles Act 1993 (Act 27 of\n                    1993) (“the 1993 LTA”) and the enactment of\n                    the Land Titles Act (Cap 157, 1994 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the 1994 LTA”), and concluded at [24] as follows: To sum up the position as of 1 March 1994, there\n                        were … three categories of adverse possession\n                        claims. Firstly, for land held under the common law\n                        system if the adverse possessor did not have 12 years of\n                        adverse possession as of 1 March 1994, he would now\n                        not be able to make a claim - see s 9(3) of the\n                        Limitation Act. Conversely, if he had the requisite 12\n                        years, he could rely on s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA to\n                        preserve his possessory title. ... 37     In the present case,\n                    continuous adverse possession of Plot D commenced as\n                    early as 1976. The requisite 12 years was thus achieved as\n                    of 1988. Such possessory title to Plot D was preserved\n                    pursuant to s 177(3) of the 1993 LTA\n                        (see[36]above). This period of adverse possession continued until\n                    the present day even despite Keppel TatLee Bank Ltd\n                    exercising its power of sale over Lot 389P in favour of\n                    the Plaintiffs in 2001.",
        "Preservation of possessory title via the Caveat\n                lodged on 4 February 2009": "38     I now come to the issue of\n                    whether the Plaintiffs’ title in respect of\n                    Plot D was preserved by the Caveat they lodged on\n                    4 February 2009 against Lot 388V. To recap,\n                    Lot 388V became registered land on 29 November\n                    2001. A qualified certificate of title was issued and a\n                    caution entered in respect of title. The Caveat which sought\n                    to preserve the Plaintiffs’ adverse title to\n                    Plot D was lodged against Lot 388V on\n                    4 February 2009, slightly more than seven years after\n                    Lot 388V became registered land. 39     The parties disagreed over\n                    the latest date by which the Caveat ought to have been\n                    lodged against Lot 388V. On the one hand, the Defendant\n                    claimed that under s 19(2) of the 1985 LTA, the\n                    Plaintiffs ought to have lodged the Caveat no later than\n                    five years from the date Lot 388V was converted to\n                    registered land (see[13]above). 40     The Plaintiffs, on the\n                    other hand, looked to s 25(2)(b) of the 1994 LTA as amended by the Land\n                    Titles (Amendment) Act 2001 (Act 25 of 2001) for guidance on\n                    the period within which they were required to lodge the\n                    Caveat to preserve their rights in respect of Plot D.\n                    This provision stipulated that a caution would only lapse\n                    ten years after the date Lot 388V was converted to\n                    registered land or 24 months after the amendment came into\n                    effect, whichever is the later. The relevant subsections of\n                    s 25 of the 1994 LTA (as amended) are as reproduced\n                    below: Cautions and\n                            lapsing of cautions 25.— (1) Upon the\n                        creation of a qualified folio, the Registrar shall enter\n                        thereon a caution warning persons dealing with the\n                        registered proprietor therein named that the land\n                        comprised therein is held subject to any interest which\n                        affected it at the date of the creation of that folio,\n                        and so long as the caution remains on that folio that\n                        land shall be so held. (2)    A caution recorded on any qualified folio (whether\n                            created under this Act or the repealed Land Titles\n                            Act (Cap. 157, 1985 Ed)) shall lapse in one of the\n                            following ways: (a)if, after the\n                                creation of the qualified folio, a purchaser for\n                                valuable consideration and without fraud becomes\n                                registered as proprietor of an estate or\n                                interest in the land comprised in the folio, the\n                                caution shall lapse as regards the estate or\n                                interest on the expiration of 5 years after the\n                                date of the last deed which was cancelled by the\n                                Registrar on the creation of the folio;\n                                or (b)if, immediately\n                                before the expiration of 10 years after the\n                                creation of the qualified folio, the caution\n                                affectingthe folio has not\n                                    lapsed as regards all estates and interests\n                                    in the land comprised in the folio or has\n                                    not been cancelled, the caution shall\n                                    lapse— (i)on the expiration of\n                                    that period; or (ii)on the expiration of\n                                    24 months after the date of commencement of\n                                    section 8 of the Land Titles (Amendment) Act\n                                    2001, whichever is the later. … (4)    When a caution lapses pursuant\n                            to subsection (2), the lapsed caution shall\n                            constitute a defunct entry and the Registrar shall,\n                            of his own motion or after the lodgement of an\n                            application in the approved form made by the\n                            proprietor of the land cause an entry to be made in\n                            respect of the lapsing of the caution. (5)    Upon the lapsing of a caution\n                            pursuant to subsection (2), the folio shall cease to\n                            be qualified and the land comprised therein shall\n                            thenceforth be held subject only to such interests\n                            as are registered or notified on the folio and to\n                            such interests as are otherwise excepted by section\n                            46. ... [emphasis added] 41     On this issue, I am unable\n                    to accept the Defendant’s argument. In my view,\n                    Lot 388V remained as unregistered land under the common\n                    law system until its conversion to registered land on\n                    29 November 2001, by which time the 1985 LTA hadalready been repealed. As\n                    at 29 November 2001 when Plot D became registered\n                    land, the relevant provision in force which governed the\n                    lapsing of cautions in respect of registered land with a\n                    qualified title was s 25 of the 1994 LTA (as\n                    amended). 42     Pausing here to make some\n                    comments on how s 25 of the 1994 LTA came to be, prior\n                    to the passing of the Land Titles (Amendment) Act 2001 (Act\n                    25 of 2001), the lapsing of cautions could only take place\n                    where there was a purchase of land subsequent to the\n                    land’s conversion into registered land. In the second\n                    reading of the Land Titles (Amendment) Bill 2001 (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates\n                        Official Report(25 July 2001)\n                    vol 73 at col 1917 (per Assoc Prof Ho Peng\n                    Kee (“Assoc Prof Ho”), Minister of State\n                    for Law)), Assoc Prof Ho explained: Land converted from the common law system is held\n                        with a caution stating that the title is\n                        subject to pre-existing claims or encumbrances. This\n                        means that the State does not guarantee\n                        the title to be free from encumbrance anda buyer of\n                        qualifiedtitle must still\n                        investigate the pre-existing common law deeds, making\n                        the conveyance more expensive. It is only when the\n                        caution lapses that the title becomes\n                        indefeasible, backed by a State guarantee.Sir, under the present law, a caution\n                            lapses only if there is a sale of the land after\n                            title conversion. The Bill will provide for the\n                            automatic lapsing of cautions 10 years after\n                            the landwas\n                            converted, or after 2 years from the commencement of\n                            this amendment, whichever is later, even if there\n                            has been no sale\n                            after titleconversion.This will result in more\n                        unqualified titles, which benefits the public, as\n                        the title investigations are easier and\n                        therefore cheaper. This amendment will reduce the number\n                        of qualified titles from about 13% to about 7%\n                        after 2 years and completely eliminate them after 10\n                        years. [emphasis added] In fact, the exact text of s 25(2) of the\n                    1994 LTA read as follows: (2)    In favour ofany purchaserof an entire\n                            estate or estate or interest in any\n                            land comprised in a qualified foliowho is registered as the\n                                proprietor in the qualified\n                                folio, a caution entered on the\n                            qualified folio whether before or after 1st\n                            March 1994 lapses, in respect of that estate or\n                            interest, on the expiration of 5 years from the date\n                            of the last conveyance which was cancelled by\n                            the Registrar upon the creation of the\n                            qualified folio [see, correspondingly, s 21 of\n                            the 1994 LTA]. [emphasis added] 43     In contrast, as alluded to\n                    in Assoc Prof Ho’s speech at[42]above, after the passing\n                    of the Land Titles (Amendment) Act 2001 (Act 25 of 2001)\n                    cautions could lapse in one of two ways, namely: (a)     the sale of the\n                        land subsequent to its conversion to registered land, in\n                        which case in favour of the purchaser the caution would\n                        lapse on the expiration of five years after the date of\n                        the last deed which was cancelled by the Registrar on\n                        the creation of the folio (see s 25(2)(a) of the 1994 LTA (as\n                        amended)); or (b)     the automatic lapsing ten years after\n                        the creation of a qualified folio pursuant to\n                            s 25(2)(b) of the\n                        1994 LTA (as amended) or 24 months after the amendment\n                        came into effect, whichever is the later\n                            (see[42]above). 44     In the present case, there\n                    was no sale of Lot 388V from the time it became\n                    registered land with qualified title until the present date.\n                    Any suggestion that the caution entered in respect of Lot\n                    388V had lapsed under s 25(2)(a) of the 1994 LTA (as amended) would\n                    therefore be untenable. That leaves s 25(2)(b) of the 1994 LTA (as amended) to\n                    be considered. 45     As rightly pointed out by\n                    the Plaintiffs, the ten-year period (as per\n                        s 25(2)(b) of the\n                    1994 LTA) only started running from the time Lot 388V\n                    became registered land on 29 November 2001. As such,\n                    the lodging of the Caveat by the Plaintiffs on\n                    4 February 2009, about seven years after Lot 388V\n                    became registered land was well within time and validly\n                    preserved the Plaintiffs title to Plot D under\n                    s 27(2) of the 1994 LTA (as amended) which\n                    provides: Any person claiming an interest in land which was\n                        subsisting at the date of the creation of a folio for\n                        that land other than an interest excepted by section 46\n                        may, so long as the folio remains qualified as to title,\n                        protect that interest by lodging a caveat pursuant to\n                        section 115, and the Registrar shall enter a\n                        notification of such a caveat in that folio. 46     Accordingly, I find that\n                    the Plaintiffs’ claim for adverse possession in this\n                    action has been properly preserved up to the present\n                    day.",
        "Conclusion": "47     For the reasons stated, I\n                    hold that the Deceased’s title to Plot D was\n                    extinguished by adverse possession. Consequently, the\n                    Plaintiffs are entitled to assert ownership rights over\n                    Plot D. The Plaintiffs’ claim in this action is\n                    therefore allowed with costs to be agreed or\n                taxed."
