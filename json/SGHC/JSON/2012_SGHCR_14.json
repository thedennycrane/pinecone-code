        "Facts": "2       This action commenced on 29 May 2012 when the plaintiff filed and served the Writ of Summons with an endorsement of the plaintiff’s alleged claim. On 20 June 2012, the plaintiff issued the Statement of Claim. On 26 June 2012, the defendant made a request, by way of a letter, for the production of the documents referred to in the Statement of Claim. The defendant also requested that these documents be provided on an urgent basis, particularly in view of the impending deadline then for the filing and service of the Defence. 3       No response from the plaintiff was forthcoming. As a result, the defendant issued a chaser on 29 June 2012, requiring the plaintiff to revert by noon on 2 July 2012. The plaintiff finally responded to the defendant’s request for documents on 4 July 2012, stating that quite apart from the issue of availability or existence of the documents requested, the plaintiff was of the view that the defendant was not entitled to discovery of documents at this stage of the proceedings. Accordingly, plaintiff was not agreeable to the defendant’s request for an extension of time to file the Defence. 4       On 5 July 2012, the defendant issued a Notice to Produce in Form 40 (“the Notice to Produce”) pursuant to O 24 r 10(1), requesting 17 categories of documents. O 24 r 10(2) stipulates that the party on whom notice is served under O 24 r 10(1) “must, within 4 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice in Form 41 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents… may be inspected… and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds” [emphasis added]. However, the plaintiff did not provide any reply in Form 41 within the stipulated time. At a pre-trial conference held on 24 July 2012, in response to the court’s query as to why no response had been given to the Notice to Produce, counsel for the plaintiff explained that they were still taking their client’s instructions on this point. 5       On 26 July 2012, the Application was taken out pursuant tointer aliaO 24 r 11 read with O 24 r 10 of the Rules of Court for the production and/or inspection of documents referred to in the Statement of Claim. Annexed to the Application was a list of 16 categories of documents (“Annex A”). It suffices to note for now that the categories of documents stated in Annex A were not entirely identical to those requested in the Notice to Produce.  The relevant portion of Annex A is reproduced here (for convenience, the abbreviations used in the following table will be adopted in the course of this judgment): S/NDocument DescriptionReference in Statement of Claim1The Time Charterpary dated 22 March 2012 for the MV “ANNA BARBARA” between the Plaintiff and Prime East Shipping Limited (“Prime East”)Paragraph 32The “Sub-Charterparty” between Prime East and Precious Charm Ltd (“Precious”)Paragraph 43The “Sub-Sub-Charterparty” between Precious and Isaphia (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“Isaphia”)Paragraph 44The Fixture Re-cap dated 22 March 2012Paragraph 65The “Previous charterparty” dated 14 July 2009Paragraph 66The “Adopted C/P”Paragraph 67The Stevedore Damages Report issued on 28 April 2012Paragraph 8(d)8Each of all documents evidencing the “repeated reminders” sent by the Plaintiffs to Prime EastParagraph 8(e)9Each of all “similar notices via email” sent by the Plaintiffs to Precious and IsaphiaParagraph 8(g)10Email dated 10 MayParagraph 8(h) and again referred to at Paragraph 5 of the Reply11Email dated 11 May from Skuld CopenhagenParagraph 8(i)12Email dated 18 May from Skuld Copenhagen to PlaintiffsParagraph 8(j)13Email dated 18 May from Skuld Copenhagen to PlaintiffsParagraph 8(l)14Email dated 22 May from Skuld Copenhagen to PlaintiffsParagraph 8(m)15Email dated 23 May from Skuld Copenhagen to the PlaintiffsParagraph 8(n)16Copies of all “finalized or consolidated claims” and/or Statements of Account worked out to the sum of USD 469,386.04Paragraph 8(p)   6       It should also be noted that in paragraphs 1(b) and 2(c) of the Defence, the defendant expressly stated that where an allegation made in the Statement of Claim was not admitted, it wasinter aliabecause the defendant did not have copies of all the relevant documents. The defendant also expressly reserved the right to deny any allegations in due course. 7       I heard parties on 22 August 2012 (“the first hearing”) and 31 August 2012 (“the second hearing”). At the second hearing, I directed the plaintiff to file an affidavit detailing all the attempts made to obtain the documents in categories 2 and 3 from the relevant third parties (viz, Prime East, Precious and Isaphia – hereinafter, “the Third Parties”).",
        "Parties’ Arguments": "8       The defendant was of the view that it was entitled to all the documents requested in Annex A. The plaintiff, however, raised specific objections to the various categories of documents requested, as follows: (a)     With regard to the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16, the plaintiff asserted that these documents werenotreferred to in the Statement of Claim, and therefore, that O 24 r 10 was inapplicable. Specifically with regard to the documents in categories 2 and 3, the plaintiff argued thateven ifthere was a reference to these documents, these documents were clearly not in the possession, custody or power of the plaintiff as these were documents in a contractual chain to which the plaintiff was not a party. (b)     With regard to the documents in categories 5 and 6, the plaintiff did not deny that these documents were referred to in the Statement of Claim. However, the plaintiff alleged that these categories were different from those sought in the Notice to Produce. The plaintiff also asserted that categories 5 and 6 referred to the same document. (c)     More generally, the plaintiff attempted to resist production ofallthe documents, on the premise that the disclosure of these documents was not necessary at the present stage of the proceedings. 9       Before turning to set out the issues that arise for determination in the present case, I note that with regard to the objectionvis-à-viscategories 5 and 6 (see [8(b)] above), the plaintiff did not elaborate on how this was an objection to an order for production. Presumably, the plaintiff was asserting that no order could be made under O 24 r 11(1) given that these categories were not requested for in the Notice to Produce. 10     However, on perusal of the Notice to Produce, it appears that the documents in categories 5 and 6 were referred to in paragraph 5 of the Notice to Produce. While I accept that paragraph 5 of the Notice to Produce could have been better worded, in any case, it clearly referred to the documents in categories 4, 5 and/or 6. Given that the plaintiff has not denied that category 4 was referred to in the Notice to Produce, and that it has in fact further asserted that categories 5 and 6 referred to the same document, I do not see how the lack of clarity in paragraph 5 of the Notice to Produce prejudiced the plaintiff in any way. As such, I do not see a need to further consider this particular ground of objection with regard to documents in categories 5 and 6.",
        "Issues": "11     The issues that arise for determination are as follows: (a)     First, whether, for the purposes of O 24 r 10(1), reference was made in the Statement of Claim to the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16 (“Issue 1”); (b)     Second, whether an order for production of the documents in categories 2 and 3 should be made, in view that these documents are allegedly not in the possession, custody or power of the plaintiff (“Issue 2”); and (c)     Third, whether the production of documents requested in Annex A was “necessary” for the purposes of O 24 r 13(1) (“Issue 3”). 12     The issues will be addressedin seriatim.",
        "Issue 1 ­– Whether reference was made to the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16": "13     As mentioned in [8(a)] above, the plaintiff asserted that the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16 werenotreferred to in the Statement of Claim, and therefore, that O 24 r 10 was inapplicable. The issue is therefore whether, for the purposes of O 24 r 10(1), reference was made in the Statement of Claim to the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16.",
        "The Law": "14     O 24 r 10 provides for the inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits. It states: 10.  Inspection of documents referred to in pleadings and affidavits (O. 24, r. 10) (1)    Any party to a cause or mattershall be entitledat any time to serve a notice in Form 40 on any other partyin whose pleadings or affidavits reference is made to any documentrequiring him toproduce that documentfor the inspection of the party giving the notice and to permit him to take copies thereof. (2)    The party on whom a notice is served under paragraph (1) must, within 4 days after service of the notice, serve on the party giving the notice a notice in Form 41 stating a time within 7 days after the service thereof at which the documents, or such of them as he does not object to produce, may be inspected at a place specified in the notice, and stating which (if any) of the documents he objects to produce and on what grounds. [emphasis added] 15     It should be noted that O 24 r 10 of the Rules of Court isin pari materiawith O 24 r 10 of the Rules of the Supreme Court (UK) (“RSC”) (for convenience, both provisions will be referred to simply as “O 24 r 10”). As such, English case law is of persuasive value in the interpretation and application of O 24 r 10. 16     It is well established that the underlying purpose of O 24 r 10 is to confer on the requesting party “the same advantage as if the documents referred to had been fully set out in the pleadings” (Rafidain Bank v Agom Universal Sugar Trading Co Ltd and another[1987] WLR 1606 (“Rafidain Bank”) at 1610H andDubai Bank Ltd v Galadari and others (No 2)[1989] 1 WLR 731 (“Dubai Bank”) at 737G, both citingQuilter v Heatly(1883) 23 Ch D 42 (“Quilter”) at 50). 17     In the event that there is no dispute that references were in fact being made to the documents in the pleadings or affidavits, courts are strongly inclined to order production of those documents because the reference to those documents, in and of itself, is construed as a form of “disclosure” by that party (Rubin v Expandable Ltd[2008] 1 WLR 1099 (“Rubin”) at 1108CperRix LJ). As Rix LJ observed, although the document in question has not been “disclosed by list, or at any rate not yet”, it has been disclosed by mention in pleadings or affidavits which are, “for the purposes of litigation, … another important and formal category of documents” (ibid). As such, the party referencing such a document should be prepared to be required to permit the inspection of the same, and the other party should be “entitledto it” [emphasis added] (ibid).  In a situation where reference to the document has been made in the pleadings or affidavits, the party referencing the document in question must show “good cause” to oppose the production of such a document (Rafidain Bankat 1613D-E, citingQuilterat 51). 18     Following from the above, one of the key issues in cases involving O 24 r 10(1) is whether an assertion in a pleading or affidavit involves a “reference … to any document” within the meaning of O 24 r 10(1). Problems arise where, although the assertion made in the affidavit or pleading does not specifically mention a document or class of documents, it gives the reader strong grounds for supposing that a document must exist (Dubai Bankat 738D-E). This, indeed, is a key issue in the present Application, with regard to the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16. 19     It is clear that a document need not be expressly mentioned in the pleadings in order to invoke O 24 r 10 (Singapore Civil Procedure 2007(GP Selvam gen ed) (Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2007) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”) at para 24/10/1). However, there seems to be a paucity of Singapore case law with regard to the precise test to be applied in determining the issue mentioned in [18] above. Indeed, the only decision by Singapore courts drawn to my attention was that ofWoodcliff Assets Ltd v Reflexology and Holistic Health Academy and Others[2009] SGHC 162 (“Woodcliff”). InWoodcliff, Senior Assistant Registrar (“SAR”) Yeong Zee Kin noted at [39] that an order for production of documents for inspection under O 24 r 13 may be made for documents explicitly referred to in pleadings or affidavits, but not for documents which were referred to by inference. In that case, SAR Yeong held that the document in question was not explicitly referred to in the affidavits, and therefore did not order production of the document (ibid). 20     Reference to English case law is highly instructive, especially given the dearth of Singapore case law as well as the identical procedural rules in question. InDubai Bank(which was cited inWoodcliffat [39], but without elaboration), the English Court of Appeal held that where a document is not explicitly referred to in pleadings or affidavits, the court’s task is to ascertain whether, on a fair meaning of the words in their context, there is a “direct allusion” [emphasis in original] to the document; it is insufficient for the reference to be made by inference (Dubai Bankat 739A-B). Other than the fact that, inprinciple, “reference” does not, in its natural and ordinary meaning, include “reference by inference”, inpractice, permitting “reference by inference” would effectively necessitate the parties (and subsequently, the court) entering into a process of inference and speculation to determine whether the document or class of documents exist (or ever existed) (ibid). 21     Indeed, the learned Law Lords inDubai Bankemphasised that in cases of “reference by inference” it may be more appropriate for the requesting party to apply for an order of discovery of a specific document or a class of documents under O 24 r 7 of the RSC (ibid). After all, the absence of a direct allusion to the document will merely mean that the applicant is not entitled to seek production and inspection under O 24 r 10; it does not preclude him from seeking discovery pursuant to other discovery rules (ibid). 22     The English cases have also helpfully alluded to several fine but crucial distinctions in ascertaining whether there is a “direct allusion” [emphasis in original] to a document in pleadings or affidavits: (a)     First, a document is directly alluded to if reference is made to thecontentsof the document as opposed to merely theeffectof a document (Dubai Bankat 739H; affirmed inRubinat 1107A): only the former would come within the meaning of “reference … to any document” in O 24 r 10(1). It is important to note that inDubai Bank, Slade LJ suggested that although the phrase “the property Blackacre was conveyed by A to B” may suggest that “one can be more or less certain that a document effecting the conveyance exists” (Dubai Bankat 738E-F), this did not suffice for the purposes of O 24 r 10. As Slade LJ emphasised, a mere opinion that on thebalance of probabilities, a transaction referred to in a pleading or affidavitmust have been effected by a document,does not give the court jurisdictionto make an order under O 24 r 10 (ibidat 739H). (b)     Second, a document is directly alluded to if the words used, on their fair meaning, convey theact of making the document itselfas opposed to a merereference to a transaction(Rubinat 1108E): only the former would come within the meaning of “reference … to any document” in O 24 r 10(1). InRubin, the expression which the court had to consider was “he wrote to me”. The court found that “he wrote” is not a merereference to a transactionotherwise to be inferred as effected by a document (contra,eg, “he conveyed”), but rather, adirect allusionto theact of making the document itself(ibid). The court also suggested that “I recorded and transcribed our telephone call that day” and “written up the interview” were examples of direct allusions to documents that would amount to a “reference” for the purposes of O 24 r 10(1) (ibidat 1108F-G). 23     Having set out the principles governing O 24 r 10(1), I turn now to consider whether the documents in categories 2, 3, 8, 14, 15 and 16 were “referred to” in the Statement of Claim.",
        "Application to the facts": "51     Counsel for the plaintiff attempted to distinguishWoodcliffby arguing that the court was there concerned with O 24 r 13, whereas the present application was one made under O 24 r 11. This argument gains no traction whatsoever, given that O 24 r 11(1) itself states that it is “subject to Rule 13(1)”, and O 24 r 13(1) explicitly stipulates that it relates to the “foregoing Rules” (which would include O 24 r 11). Counsel for the plaintiff provided no further reason to distinguishWoodcliff, and I see no reason why the reasoning inWoodcliffshould not apply to the present case. 52     I find that the production of the documents in Annex A is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. First, and crucially, the plaintiff did not argue that the documents requested are unnecessary for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. Rather, the contentions raised by the plaintiff werelimitedto arguing that the production of documents is not necessaryat the present stage of the proceedings. This, as mentioned in [50] above, is not a relevant argument insofar as O 24 r 13(1) is concerned. Second, I agree with the reasons cited by the defendant in [46] abovevis-à-visthe necessity of the documents for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. 53     As such, I find that the test of necessity in O 24 r 13(1) is satisfied, and exercise my discretion under O 24 r 11(1) in the defendant’s favour. This does not apply, however, to the documents in categories 8, 14, 15 and 16 as I have found that no reference was made to these documents in the plaintiff’s pleadings (see [28] above).",
        "Issue 2 – Whether order for production should be made for documents allegedly not in plaintiff’s possession, custody or power": "29     Specifically with regard to the documents in categories 2 and 3, which I have found to have been referred to in the Statement of Claim (see [26] above), the plaintiff argued that an order for production should not be made because these were documents in a contractual chain to which the plaintiff was not a party (and accordingly were allegedly not in the plaintiff’s possession, custody or power). The issue is therefore whether an order for production of the documents in categories 2 and 3 should be made in view that these documents are allegedly not in the possession, custody or power of the plaintiff.",
        "The law": "48     Before an order for production will be made under O 24 r 13(1), the court must opine that the order isnecessaryeither fordisposing fairly of the cause or matteror forsaving costs. Order 24 r 13(1) provides: 13.  Production to be ordered only if necessary, etc. (O. 24, r. 13) (1)    No order for the production of any documents for inspection or to the Court shall be made under any of the foregoing Rules unless the Court is of the opinion that the order isnecessaryeither fordisposing fairly of the cause or matteror forsaving costs. … [emphasis added] 49     The plaintiff argued that the discovery of the documents in Annex A at the at the present stage of the proceedings would not assist either in the fair disposal of the matter or save costs. This argument was similar to the one raised by the defendants inWoodcliff. InWoodcliff, the court recognised that for discovery applications under O 24 rr 1, 5 and 6, it was possible to defer discovery of a document on the basis that disclosureat that stage of the proceedingsis not necessary, leaving it open for a subsequent discovery request to be made at a later stage of the proceedings (Woodcliffat [36]). This is because O 24 r 7 (to which O 24 rr 1, 5 and 6 are subject) provides: 7.  Discovery to be ordered only if necessary (O. 24, r. 7) On the hearing of an application for an order under Rule 1, 5 or 6, the Court may, if satisfied that discovery is not necessary, ornot necessary at that stage of the cause or matter, dismiss or, as the case may be, adjourn the application and shall in any case refuse to make such an order if and so far as it is of opinion that discovery is not necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs. [emphasis added] 50     In contrast, there isno temporal dimension to the test of necessityunder O 24 r 13 (Woodcliffat [37]). Accordingly, under O 24 r 13, if production is necessary either for disposing fairly of the cause or matter or for saving costs, the document “has to beproduced for inspection” [emphasis added]. Indeed, the court went so far as to emphasise that O 24 r 13did notgive the court the flexibility to defer an order for production to a later stage of the proceedings once it is found that such production wasnecessary(ibid).",
        "Issue 3 – Whether production of documents “necessary”": "45     As a general contention, the plaintiff contended that the production of documents requested in Annex A was not necessary at the present stage of the proceedings, because (a) the defendant has filed a substantive Defence, without the need for reference to the aforesaid documents; and (b) there are no interlocutory applications or applications for summary determination of the matter in the proceedings at present which warrant discovery of these documents at this stage for the fair disposition of the same or for saving costs. 46     The defendant argued that disclosure of the documents requested in Annex A was necessary because (a) the disclosure of the documents would put the defendant in a better position to ascertain whether it is expedient and/or justified to resort to summary processes and/or other interlocutory applications; and (b) as alluded to in [6] above, it was apparent on the face of the Defence that it was filed with an unambiguous and express reservation of rights to amend the Defence because the plaintiff had pleaded matters which the defendant was either unaware of and/or not privy to. 47     The issue is therefore whether the production of documents requested in Annex A is “necessary” for the purposes of O 24 r 13(1).",
        "Conclusion": "54     In view of the foregoing, I order that the plaintiff does, within seven (7) days of the date of this order, file and serve on the defendant a list of documents and an affidavit verifying the same, stating whether it has or has had at any time in its possession, custody or power documents in categories 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12 and 13 of Annex A, and if the documents have been but are now not in its possession, custody or power, stating when it parted with the documents and what has become of the documents. No order is made for the documents in categories 8, 14, 15 and 16. 55     I additionally order that there be inspection of all documents specified in the list of documents filed and served pursuant to [54] above, within seven (7) days of service of the said list. The defendant is at liberty to take copies of the said documents. 56     I will now hear parties on costs."
