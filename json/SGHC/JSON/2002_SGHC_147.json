        "Yani’s version of events on 21 June 2001": "4.        It is important to lay out in full the\n\nactual words used by Yani during her testimony in court to describe the incident, which\n\nresulted in the three charges being brought against the appellant :On 21 June 2001, at about 1.00 am, my employer kicks my\n\n  back 3 times. I was then washing clothing in the bathroom. Maybe it was because I\n\n  didn’t have enough sleep. I was sleepy and she kicked me 3 times. It was painful. I\n\n  didn’t say anything to her. Maybe my employer thought I was sleeping at that time,\n\n  then my employer poured hot water at the back of my neck, towards the lower part of my\n\n  neck. Maybe, she took the water from the thermos flask. She used a cup to get the water.It\n\n  was hot.I didn’t say anything. I continued washing the clothing becauseI\n\n  felt hotin my face. I looked down. Maybe my employer thought then I was still\n\n  sleeping. Then she poured hot water on me. She wanted to pour hot water on my face. Then I\n\n  used my left hand to block, using my left upper arm. I kept quiet.I felt very very\n\n  hot.I didn’t respond. I continued to wash clothing. I felt scared.[emphasis\n\n  added]",
        "The appellant’s version of events": "5.        The district judge had found that there\n\nwere many shifts in the appellant’s defence. This would be elaborated upon later on.\n\nThe ultimate version which the appellant put forth and maintained at this appeal was that\n\nshe had accidentally caused the scalding on the morning of 20 June 2001. She had been in\n\nthe kitchen cooking and was at the sink holding a bowl of hot water. Yani came into the\n\nkitchen and squatted down to retrieve a floor mat in the cabinet below the sink. When\n\nAndres (the appellant’s baby boy whom Yani was employed to look after) started\n\ncrying, Yani stood up and knocked into the appellant, causing the hot water to spill onto\n\nYani. After the incident, she had apologised to Yani and applied cream for her. In the\n\nevening of 20 June 2001, the whole family, together with Yani, had gone to the National\n\nLibrary to do research for a hearing the next day at the Small Claims Tribunal. They\n\narrived home at about 9.30 pm. Both the appellant and her husband wanted to prepare for\n\ntheir case by reading the materials which they had photocopied earlier at the National\n\nLibrary. At around 12.30 am on 21 June 2001, they started preparing video clips to be used\n\nas evidence for their case. They only finished the video clips at around 2.00 am. The next\n\nmorning, they were at the Small Claims Tribunal until 2.30 pm. In the evening, the whole\n\nfamily went out together with Yani to order a birthday cake at Ang Mo Kio Central. They\n\nreached home at about 10.00 pm and it was at about 10.45 pm that two policemen who had\n\nresponded to a call arrived.",
        "The testimony of the two policemen": "6.        On 21 June 2001, the police received an\n\nanonymous telephone call from a male caller at 10.36 pm. The caller stated ‘Maid was\n\nabused’ and gave the home address of the appellant. Sgt Tan Chee Hiong (\"Sgt\n\nTan\") and Sgt Neo Weiko (\"Sgt Neo\") were dispatched to the appellant’s\n\nhome. When they arrived, it was the appellant’s husband, Low Gim Huat (\"Mr\n\nLow\"), who came to the door. The police officers informed him of a maid abuse\n\ncomplaint. They were not let immediately into the apartment but were told to wait for a\n\nwhile, before the door was closed on them. Several minutes later, the appellant opened the\n\ndoor to let the police officers in.7.        When they were within the apartment, the\n\npolice officers attempted to ask Yani what happened. Questions were addressed to Yani but\n\nthe appellant kept on interrupting during the questioning. The appellant told them that\n\nYani had an injury at the left upper arm. Sgt Tan saw that there was a bandage on her arm\n\nand asked Yani to remove it. However, he saw only parts of the injury as the bandage was\n\nstuck onto the skin and Yani was in pain. The appellant appeared scared and nervous. As\n\nthe appellant kept on interrupting on the questioning of Yani, Sgt Tan had to bring Yani\n\noutside the unit, out onto the corridor to interview her. Yani was reluctant to speak and\n\nappeared tearful and scared. When Sgt Tan persisted in asking her to tell the truth, she\n\nbroke down and told him in broken English that the appellant threw hot water onto her. Sgt\n\nTan called for assistance. SIO William Lee came to the scene with a Malay interpreter and\n\ninterviewed Yani. A white mug identified by Yani as used by the appellant to throw hot\n\nwater onto her was then seized from the kitchen. Photographs were also directed to be\n\ntaken.8.        Sgt Neo also recalled an occurrence when\n\nthe appellant had behaved strangely by inviting him into the study room, when Sgt Tan went\n\noutside the unit to speak to SIO William Lee. She informed him that she had something to\n\ntalk to him privately. When he entered into the room with her, she closed the door. She\n\nsaid that she didn’t abuse the maid. Sgt Neo felt that the statement was a general\n\none and immediately opened the door as he was afraid of allegations of molest and\n\ncorruption. As he opened the door, he saw Mr Low walking away from Yani upon discovering\n\nthat he (Sgt Tan) was coming out of the room.",
        "The decision below": "9.        At the conclusion of the trial, the\n\ndistrict judge found that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThere was no evidence of inconsistency in the prosecution’s case. Neither was any one\n\nof the prosecution’s witnesses discredited. Yani’s consistent story was\n\ncorroborated by the testimony of the two police officers who were disinterested witnesses.\n\nThere was also independent medical evidence of Yani’s numerous injuries.10.        On the other hand, he found that the\n\nappellant’s version of the incident changed several times during the trial. The first\n\nversion started with Yani squatting down to wash clothes in the kitchen bathroom. The\n\nappellant walked in holding a mug of hot water, when Yani suddenly got up and knocked into\n\nthe appellant. Then, the story changed to one where the appellant wascookingin\n\nthe kitchen, and Yani waswashing clothesin the kitchen bathroom. Later, it\n\nchanged again, to that of Yanicoming into the kitchen,squatting down to retrieve\n\na floor-mat and in the process of getting up, colliding with the appellant who was then\n\nholding acupof hot water. Eventually, when the appellant testified, she changed\n\nthe story to hersoaking utensilsin hot water and holdinga small rice bowlof hot water. Finally, in the closing submissions of the defence, it changed again, to\n\nthat of the appellantsoaking a bowl with hot water(the district judge’s\n\nemphasis).11.        The defence of the appellant that\n\nYani had self-inflicted the injuries on herself, other than the burn injury, was found to\n\nbe far-fetched and unbelievable. The defence’s submission was that the injuries were\n\nself-inflicted either within the six days before photographs of the injuries were taken on\n\n27 June 2001 or when the appellant and her husband were at the Small Claims Tribunal on\n\nthe morning of 21 June 2001. The first possibility was groundless as Yani was examined on\n\n22 June 2001. As for the second possibility, the district judge found it incredible that,\n\nafter the scalding incident, Yani, without any motive or purpose, immediately came up with\n\na scheme, self-inflicted such extensive injuries on herself and then informed the police\n\nthrough an anonymous telephone call by an unidentified male. Despite all the preparation,\n\nwhich the appellant had apparently done with the intention to repatriate Yani back to\n\nIndonesia, there was no evidence that Yani had any knowledge of it at all.12.        Therefore, the district judge convicted\n\nthe appellant and sentenced her to ten months’ imprisonment for scalding Yani with\n\nhot water, two months’ imprisonment for kicking Yani’s back three times and also\n\nimposed a fine of $500 for pouring warm water on the back of her head. The imprisonment\n\nsentences were ordered to run concurrently.",
        "The appeal": "13.        In this appeal, the bulk of the\n\nappellant’s challenges were directed towards the district judge’s findings of\n\nfact. The principles governing an appellate court’s role in reviewing a trial\n\njudge’s findings of fact are well-settled. InPP v Azman binAbdullah[1998] 2 SLR 704at  21, I made the following observations :It is well-settled law that in any appeal against a\n\n  finding of fact, an appellate court will generally defer to the conclusion of the trial\n\n  judge who has had the opportunity to see and assess the credibility of the witnesses. An\n\n  appellate court, if it wishes to reverse the trial judge’s decision,must not\n\n  merely entertain doubts whether the decision is right but must be convinced that it is\n\n  wrong : see PP v Poh Oh Sim[1990] SLR 1047 [emphasis added].I now turn to the appeal proper.",
        "Shifts in the appellant’s defence": "14.        It was contended that the supposed shifts\n\nin the defence as highlighted by the district judge in his judgment happened as a result\n\nof a series of mistakes made by the appellant’s counsel and that she had informed him\n\naccordingly of the mistakes, immediately after the hearing on 29 October and again before\n\n3 December 2001. When the appellant’s counsel made mistakes again at the hearing on 3\n\nDecember 2001, the appellant discharged him and represented herself in court. As such, the\n\ndefence was only brought in line with the correct version ultimately put forth on 3\n\nDecember 2001. What the district judge cited as a shift was no more than the\n\nappellant’s reaffirming the correct version of what happened.15.        I found this difficult to accept. The\n\nshifts in defence did not merely involve which receptacle the appellant was holding when\n\nthe accident occurred; whether it was a mug or a bowl or a cup. It shifted entirely from\n\nYanisquatting down to wash clothes in the kitchen bathroomand the appellantwalking\n\nin with a mug of hot waterto Yanibeing in the kitchensquatting downto\n\nretrieve a floor matand knocking into the appellantwho was at the sink with a\n\nbowl of hot water.The appellant was noted by the district judge to be a highly\n\nintelligent woman. She was writing notes throughout the whole trial. On 29 October 2001,\n\nthere were several occasions when she had signalled to her counsel for communication. The\n\ndistrict judge had allowed the counsel to step over to the dock to discuss things with\n\nher. The ‘mistakes’ made by counsel were not minor contradictions but deviated\n\ngreatly from the supposed ‘correct version’. And yet the appellant failed to\n\npoint out those mistakes to her counsel or to the court during the trial of 29 October\n\n2001, despite having had several opportunities to do so.",
        "The video clips": "16.        The district judge was doubtful of\n\nthe timings stated in the video clips which were recorded on the night of the alleged\n\nabuse. In his view, the timer could always be adjusted to reflect the time desired.\n\nCounsel for the appellant argued that the district judge had erred in this regard. I\n\naccept his submissions that, while the timer could be adjustedbeforethe recording\n\nstarted, it could not be done soafterthe recording. There was sufficient evidence\n\nto show that the preparation of the video clips was made way before the police arrived at\n\nthe appellant’s apartment on the night of 21 June 2001. As such, there was no reason\n\nto doubt the authenticity of the video clips.17.        Nevertheless, in my opinion, the district\n\njudge was correct to attach very little weight to the video clips. The video clips were\n\ntendered as evidence in court to substantiate the appellant’s claim that she was\n\nassisting her husband, Mr Low, to make the video clips on 21 June 2001 between 12.30 pm to\n\n2.00 am. It was argued that she could not thus have scalded Yani at around 1.15 am, the\n\ntime at which the incident was alleged to have occurred. However, the first two video\n\nclips was found to have stated the time to be 12.53 am and 1.23 am respectively and they\n\ndid not contain any images. The third video clip had a recording of a wooden TV console as\n\nwell as of Mr Low opening drawers, with the appellant’s voice in the background. This\n\nthird video clip had the timing stated as 1.54 am. As the first two video clips did not\n\ncontain any images, and the time of the alleged abuses as stated in the charges were\n\nbetween 1 am and 1.15 am, it was clear that the video clips did not help to advance the\n\nappellant’s case. In addition, Mr Low’s testimony that the appellant was with\n\nhim during the entire recording of the video clips had to be treated with caution as he\n\nwas found to be an interested witness. Mr Low’s doubts, hesitation, signs of anxiety\n\nand nervousness in court as recorded by the district judge further eroded his credibility\n\nas a witness. In my view, the district judge was clearly entitled to disbelieve Mr\n\nLow’s testimony.Yani’s testimony of the incident18.  It was argued that the district judge was wrong to have believed\n\nYani’s testimony as her version of events was inherently incredible. Yani had\n\ntestified that she was squatting down in the toilet and was sleepy. Presumably she was\n\nleaning forward. SIO William Lee’s testimony was that Yani had told him that her\n\nemployer came from behind and used hot water to splash on her left arm. In such a\n\nposition, it was not possible for Yani to have known where the water was obtained from or\n\nthe receptacle used by the appellant and yet Yani identified both the thermos flask and\n\nthe mug respectively. Furthermore, Yani’s version that she used her arm to ward off\n\nthe hot water would have necessitated or at least given cause for the sides of her body to\n\nbe scalded as well and yet there were no burn marks on the left side of her body. In\n\naddition, it was most unusual how the same ‘hot’ water could have such markedly\n\ndifferent effects, causing no marks or burns on Yani’s neck but yet purportedly hot\n\nenough to scald her arm.19.        In my opinion, there is really nothing so\n\nunbelievable about Yani’s testimony. She had testified in her examination-in-chief\n\nthat \"maybe, she took the water from the thermos flask\". She was not clear as to\n\nthe origin of the hot water but surely it was not difficult for her to assume that it came\n\nfrom a thermos flask in the kitchen, in which hot water is normally stored. Furthermore,\n\nit could not be said that it was impossible for her to see the receptacle used by the\n\nappellant to splash hot water on her,asshe raised her left arm to ward off the\n\nwater. It was a reflex action, indicative of the fact that Yani must have seen the\n\nappellant approaching her with the receptacle a few moments before the hot water was\n\nactually splashed onto her left arm.20.        As for the fact that there were no burn\n\nmarks on her left side, it did not mean that Yani’s version was not to be preferred\n\nover the appellant’s. The district judge was entitled to note the nature of the\n\ninjury from the photographs, as a well-defined burn from severe scalding and compare it\n\nwith both the appellant’s and Yani’s versions of the events. I was inclined to\n\nbelieve that such a well-defined burn would more likely be caused by a deliberate\n\nsplashing of hot water using direct force rather than an accidental spillage of hot water\n\nfrom a bowl. In my view, the district judge was correct to make the determination that\n\nYani’s version of events was more in line with the burn injury.21.        As for the allegation that the\n\n‘hot’ water was the same and could not have caused different effects, the\n\ndistrict judge had dealt with this point thoroughly in his judgment and, in this regard,\n\nit was not possible to overturn his finding of fact. He had rightly noted that Yani used\n\ntwo different descriptions for the temperature of water. He had also referred toKamus\n\nDwibahasa,a Malay dictionary and found that in the Malay language, no difference is\n\nmade between ‘warm’ and ‘hot’. In the light of such observations, he\n\nwas of the view that the two different phrases used by Yani to describe what she felt to\n\nbe different temperatures poured on her neck and her arm respectively, ‘hot’ and\n\n‘very very hot’ must be regarded as sensible and fitting in the circumstances.",
        "The rest of the injuries": "22.        In the medical report itself, Dr Tan had\n\nrecorded that he was unable to say anything of the age of the injuries and that the\n\npossibility of self-infliction of the injuries was uncertain. Counsel for the appellant\n\nargued that there was no evidence that Yani was never allowed to leave the apartment. She\n\nhad had opportunities to meet with the neighbours and even to mingle with other maids in\n\nthe estate. If the appellant had indeed abused Yani, why had she not complained to anyone\n\nabout it? Yani could also have gone to her agent, Florence Chua (\"Ms Chua\"), for\n\nhelp but she did not do so. It was said that the only reasonable explanation for this was\n\nthat the appellant had never assaulted or abused her. The district judge failed to\n\nconsider sufficiently the possibility that the rest of the injuries, other than the burn\n\ninjury found on Yani, were self-inflicted or even that they were old injuries from bruises\n\nthat Yani had sustained during the course of the work.23.        From the evidence, it seemed that the\n\nonly time that Yani was left alone in the apartment after the alleged ‘scalding\n\naccident’ on 20 June 2001 was when the appellant and her husband had been at the\n\nSmall Claims Tribunal. It is doubtful that during that short span of time, Yani could have\n\nself-inflicted herself with such extensive injuries and then come up with a scheme to get\n\nan anonymous male caller to inform the police.24.        More importantly, the appellant had not\n\nbeen able to give a reasonable explanation as to why Yani would have wanted to\n\nself-inflict injuries on herself. The only reason that the appellant offered was that Yani\n\ndid not want to be sent back to Indonesia. Yet, despite all that was being done to\n\nrepatriate Yani back to Indonesia, such as obtaining a letter of repatriation from the\n\nmaid agency, there was no evidence whatsoever that Yani had any knowledge of it. Without a\n\nmotive on Yani’s part, it is an incredible defence to say that Yani had planned,\n\nexecuted and endured such a great extent of injuries on herself.25.        To suggest that the injuries were\n\nsustained in the course of work was even more revealing. There were bruises corresponding\n\ntofinger markson the right arm of Yani. By no stretch of any imagination, could\n\nit be said that such bruises were sustained in the ordinary course of work as a domestic\n\nmaid.",
        "The biting incident": "26.        It transpired during the trial that\n\nYani had bitten the arm of the appellant’s baby, Andres, once before and this had\n\nbeen reported to the police by the appellant on 23 March 2001. It was argued by the\n\ncounsel for the appellant that this incident was of major significance; namely, that it\n\nshowed the vicious nature and character of Yani in biting a helpless 9-month old baby,\n\nYani’s propensity to lie in court and finally the forgiving and considerate nature of\n\nthe appellant in giving Yani a second chance and not repatriating her immediately. Counsel\n\nfor the appellant made much of this incident, contending that the district judge had,\n\nunfortunately, not appreciated sufficiently the significance of this biting incident.27.        A reading of the judgment of the district\n\njudge revealed that he did, in fact, accept that Yani had bitten the arm of the baby and\n\nhad considered the issue of whether a maid who had bitten a baby could well concoct lies\n\nto ‘frame’ the appellant. He was of the conclusion that Yani had not been\n\ninconsistent and saw no reason to disbelieve her testimony that she bit the baby when the\n\nappellant was beating her legs with a toy stick. Yani had never given different versions\n\nof the biting incident herself. Her version of the incident was contradicted by the maid\n\nagent, Ms Chua and by the appellant’s good friend, Basil Camoeus, who spoke to Yani\n\nsoon after the incident. However, the district judge had dealt with their evidence\n\nthoroughly. He found that Ms Chua was only told about the incident by the appellant\n\nherself and had never had the opportunity to speak to Yani about it. As such, Yani could\n\nnot have told her that she bit the baby because she wanted to force a three-pin plug out\n\nof the baby’s mouth. As for Basil Cameous’s testimony, the district judge found\n\nit to be vague and did not establish much other than the fact that Yani had bitten the\n\nbaby, a point which was not disputed. Despite the biting incident, the district judge\n\nfound, on the totality of evidence before him, that Yani had been truthful and that there\n\nwas no basis to reject her evidence. I saw no reason to depart from the district\n\njudge’s finding that Yani had neither been inconsistent nor had she concocted lies to\n\nframe the appellant.",
        "Conclusion": "28.        In conclusion, I found that the\n\nappellant could not succeed in her appeal. She was unable to show that the district judge\n\nwas wrong in coming to his conclusion that the prosecution had proven its case beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. Yani was merely eighteen years old at the time of employment and the\n\nappellant was her first employer since she arrived in Singapore from Indonesia. The\n\nactions of the appellant in abusing a mere eighteen-year old girl under her power and\n\nauthority were wholly reprehensible. The district judge had properly considered all the\n\ncircumstances of the case on the issue of sentence and the sentence could not be regarded\n\nas manifestly excessive. Accordingly, I dismissed the appeal and upheld the sentence\n\nimposed by the court below.",
