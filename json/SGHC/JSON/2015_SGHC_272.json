        "AR’s order": "5       For special damages, the AR awarded the\n                    Plaintiff the following: (a)     Pre-trial medical expenses agreed at\n                        $35,201.12; (b)     Pre-trial transport expenses agreed at $6,500; (c)     Mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings and\n                        employer’s Central Provident Fund (“CPF”) contribution\n                        at $43,882.80; and (d)     Pre-trial domestic help expenses agreed at $11,994.85.

        "Plaintiff’s appeal": "10     In Registrar’s Appeal No 377 of 2014,\n                    the Plaintiff appeals against part of the AR’s award. 11     In relation to special damages, the Plaintiff\n                    appeals against the AR’s award of S$43,882.80 for the mother’s\n                    pre-trial loss of earnings and employer’s CPF contribution. 12     In relation to general damages, the Plaintiff\n                    appeals against the following awards: (a)     the Plaintiff’s loss of future\n                        earnings assessed at $233,878.14; (b)     future medical expenses assessed at\n                    $317,380.75; (c)     future\n                        expenses for daily consumables and essentials assessed at\n                    $46,800; (d)     mother’s loss of future earnings and employer’s CPF\n                        contributions assessed at $235,248; (e)     cost of future nursing care assessed at\n                        $106,420.20; (f)     future transport expenses assessed at $23,520; and (g)     future cost of Mental Capacity Act\n                        application assessed at $2,000. 13     The Plaintiff also appeals against the\n                    AR’s award of interest. However, no submissions were made on this before\n                    me. I therefore find no basis to vary the AR’s award of\n                interest.",
        "Defendant’s appeal": "14     In Registrar’s Appeal No 383 of 2014,\n                    the Defendant appeals against the following awards and orders: (a)     the Plaintiff’s loss of future\n                        earnings assessed at $233,878.14; (b)     mother’s loss of future earnings and\n                        employer’s CPF contributions assessed at $235,248; (c)     the Provisional Damages Order;\n                        and (d)     costs fixed\n                        at $85,000.00 plus GST.",

        "High Court’s role in a Registrar’s Appeal on assessment\n                of damages": "18     As a preliminary, it is important to clarify\n                    the role of a High Court judge who hears an appeal from an assistant registrar\n                    on assessment of damages under O 56 r 1 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5,\n                    2014 Rev Ed) (“ROC”). 19     The authorities establish that the judge in\n                    chambers hears the matter not as an appeal in the true sense of the word, but\n                    deals with the Registrar’s Appeal on assessment of damages as if the\n                    matter came before him for the first time:Chang Ah Lek v Lim\n                        Ah Koon[1998] 3 SLR(R) 551 at [20], affirmed inTan Boon Heng v Lau Pang Cheng David[2013] 4 SLR 718\n                        (“Tan Boon Heng”) at\n                    [16]. 20     Indeed, the Court of Appeal helpfully\n                    explained inTan Boon Hengat [16] that in\n                    assessing damages, the assistant registrar is “exercising powers and\n                    jurisdiction devolved to him from those vested in a High Court judge”.\n                    Therefore, “a judge in chambers who hears a Registrar’s Appeal is\n                    not exercising an appellate jurisdiction - for that term would only be accurate\n                    and applicable where the appealed decision emanates from an inferior court or\n                    tribunal - butconfirmatoryjurisdiction\n                    instead”. 21     There are practical implications to the fact\n                    that the judge in chambers exercises aconfirmatory, rather thanappellate, jurisdiction. For one, the judge is not confined to\n                    interfering with the assistant registrar’s exercise of discretion only if\n                    damages were assessed on wrong principles of law or misapprehensions of fact:Tan Boon Hengat [18]. Instead, the judge is\n                    entitled to exercise his discretion afresh, while giving due weight to the\n                    assistant registrar’s decision:Tan Boon\n                        Hengat [21]. Second, the judge also has a wider discretion to\n                    admit new evidence and even recall witnesses:Lassiter Ann\n                        Masters v To Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)[2004] 2 SLR(R) 392 at\n                    [10] and [22]. Indeed, both parties helpfully brought the caseSwiss Butchery Pte Ltd v Huber Ernst and others and another\n                        suit[2013] 4 SLR 381 to this court’s attention, where the\n                    High Court did recall witnesses in a Registrar’s Appeal on assessment of\n                    damages. 22     Whilst the judge can exercise his discretion\n                    afresh, unfettered by the assistant registrar’s decision, it must be borne\n                    in mind that the assistant registrar still has the advantage of having heard the\n                    oral evidence of the witnesses first hand. As the Court of Appeal noted inTan Boon Hengat [24], a distinction must be\n                    drawn between findings of fact based solely on affidavit and documentary\n                    evidence, and findings based partly or wholly on oral evidence. The Court of\n                    Appeal had made the following observations: (a)     Where the assistant\n                        registrar’s findings of fact are based on oral evidence, the standard\n                        of review “should be the same as that applied to a trial\n                        judge’s factual findings on appeal to the Court of Appeal - so that\n                        these findings may be overturned only if they are plainly wrong or against\n                        the weight of the evidence”:Tan Boon\n                            Hengat [43]. (b)     Where the assistant registrar’s findings of fact\n                        are based on affidavit and documentary evidence, the judge is in no less\n                        advantageous a position, and hence, may make his own findings afresh,\n                        unfettered by the assistant registrar’s judgment:Tan Boon Hengat [44]. 23     It is with the above principles in mind, that\n                    I consider the present appeals before me.",
        "Mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings": "24     The AR awarded the Plaintiff damages of\n                    $43,882.80 for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings. I briefly set out\n                    her reasoning, which can be found at [102]–[103] of the AR’s\n                    Judgment: 102    Prior to the accident, the mother was working as a\n                            receptionist in a law firm … and was drawing a monthly salary of\n                            $1,300, excluding employer’s CPF contribution of $208. As a result\n                            of the accident, she had to quit her job to take care of the plaintiff\n                            full-time. … 103    In respect of the mother’s pre-trial loss of\n                            earnings, I allowed the claim at $1,508 (including employer’s CPF)\n                            per month for a period of 29 months and 3 days, being the time from the\n                            date of the accident to the commencement of the assessment hearing on 10\n                            December 2013. I arrived at the sum of $43,882.80. 25     The Plaintiff appeals against the multiplier\n                    of 29 months and three days used by the AR. He submits that “the\n                    multiplier should be assessed from the date of the accident [ie, July 2011] to the end of the assessment hearing in April\n                    2014 (being a period of 33 months and 24 days)”. According to the\n                    Plaintiff, the AR was wrong to award the Plaintiff damages under this headonlyup to the date of the commencement of the\n                    assessment hearing on 10 December 2013. 26     At the hearing before me, the Defendant made\n                    no objections to the Plaintiff’s appeal and submissions on this\n                    front. 27     I agree with the Plaintiff that he should have\n                    been awarded damages for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings up to the\n                    end of the assessment hearing in April 2014. The following statement inBritish Transport Commission v Gourley[1956]\n                    AC 185 at 206 is helpful: In an action for personal injuries the damages are always divided into two\n                        main parts. First, there is what is referred to as special damage, which has\n                        to be specially pleaded and proved. This consists of out-of-pocket expenses\n                        and loss of earnings incurred down to the date of trial, and is generally\n                        capable of substantially exact calculation. Secondly, there is general\n                        damage which the law implies and is not specially pleaded. This includes\n                        compensation for pain and suffering and the like, and, if the injuries\n                        suffered are such as to lead to continuing or permanent disability,\n                        compensation for loss of earning power in the future. 28     Special damages are accordingly those which at\n                    trial are capable of substantially exact calculation. This particular head is\n                    recoverable on the basis that it is part of the Plaintiff’s loss (see\n                    discussion at [86] below). If his mother did not stop work, the Plaintiff would\n                    have had to engage a full-time nurse. I note in passing that what is important\n                    is that there should be no overlap with the claim for loss of future earnings\n                    for the mother (which is dealt with later). 29     Therefore, I award the Plaintiff $50,970.40\n                    for his mother’s pre-trial loss of earnings. I derive the figure in the\n                    following way: $1,508 x 33 months + $1,508 x 24 days / 30 days =$50,970.40",
        "Appropriate multiplier for future expenses": "30     Before discussing the Plaintiff’s appeal\n                    on the damages awarded for the different types of future expenses he would\n                    incur, I first deal with the Plaintiff’s appeal on themultiplierthat should be applied for future expenses generally.\n                    My decision on this would affect the damages awarded for all the heads of claim\n                    relating to the Plaintiff’s future expenses. 31     The AR determined the multiplier for future\n                    expenses based on the Plaintiff’s life expectancy at the date of trial.\n                    The parties’ medical experts agreed that the Plaintiff had 27 more years\n                    to live. The AR’s decision was therefore based on a life expectancy of 27\n                    more years. After considering the case authorities, the AR applied a discount\n                    and held that a multiplier of12 yearswas fair\n                    and reasonable. It is worth noting that before the AR, the Defendant submitted\n                    that a multiplier of 12 years should apply, while the Plaintiff submitted that a\n                    multiplier of 18 years should apply (27 years subject to a 33% reduction in view\n                    of accelerated payment). 32     The Plaintiff appeals against the AR’s\n                    decision that a 12-year multiplier should apply for future expenses generally.\n                    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that the appropriate multiplier should at least\n                    be 16 years. The Plaintiff relies on the Court of Appeal’sdictainLai Wai Keong Eugene v Loo\n                        Wei Yen[2014] 3 SLR 702 (“Lai Wai\n                        Keong Eugene”) at [43] that a 15-year multiplier for an\n                    appellant with a lifespan of 30 years “while perhaps on the low side,\n                    remains within the range contemplated by the authorities”. On this basis,\n                    the Plaintiff argues that if a 15-year multiplier is “on the low\n                    side” for a plaintiff with 30 years to live, a 16-year multiplier is more\n                    appropriate in the present case. 33     The Court of Appeal inPoh\n                        Huat Heng Corp Pte Ltd and others v Hafizul Islam Kofil Uddin[2012] 3 SLR 1003 (“Hafizul”) at\n                    [48] and [54] endorsed two possible approaches to determining the appropriate\n                    multiplier: the first, is to “fix the multiplier by looking at the\n                    multipliers used in comparable cases” (see [48(a)]), and the second, is\n                    to “apply a pure arithmetical discount” for accelerated payment,\n                    contingencies, inflation, and other vicissitudes of life (see [48(b)]). This was\n                    affirmed inLai Wai Keong Eugeneat\n                    [19]–[22]. In particular, the Court of Appeal inLai\n                        Wai Keong Eugeneclarified that: (a)     The second approach is not\n                        invariably to be preferred over the first approach (see\n                    [22]). (b)     The court\n                        may have to apply the first approach exclusively if evidence on interest\n                        rates, inflation rates, possible contingenciesetc, are lacking (see [21]). (c)     Even in the application of the second approach,\n                        the figure derived should be “cross-checked with the multipliers used\n                        in past cases so as to achieve consistency with cases involving\n                        similarly-situated plaintiffs” (see [20]). 34     It is also worth noting the court’s\n                    remarks inHafizulat [54]: … That said, a blind adherence to the multipliers in previous cases\n                        is not desirable. The court should consider in each case whether the\n                        previous cases are truly comparable, and should not hesitate to depart from\n                        the multipliers used in previous cases if the circumstances call for\n                        it. 35     Indeed, it seems to me that in the absence of\n                    specific evidence on interest rates, inflationetc, the court has no choice but to rely exclusively on past\n                    precedents. Deducing a figure from past cases is undoubtedly not an exact\n                    science. There must be no illusion of mathematical precision. There is no rule\n                    of law in Singapore stipulating specific rates of discount. The court therefore\n                    only has the principles of consistency, proportionality, and its own sense of\n                    fairness and justice to guide it in determining the appropriate\n                    multiplier. 36     In the present case, no evidence was provided\n                    to the court below, or to me, on the factors a court may consider under the\n                    second approach inHafizul. Neither party\n                    attempted to adduce evidence on, for example, the contingencies the Plaintiff\n                    was at higher risk of suffering from pre-accident, deposit interest rates, or\n                    inflation rates in their submissions on the appropriate multiplier for future\n                    expenses. Nothing about the specific facts of the Plaintiff’s case was\n                    brought to my attention by either side for especial consideration in determining\n                    the appropriate multiplier. I am thus left to broadly decide the appropriate\n                    multiplier for future expenses based on case precedents and the general facts\n                    before me. I repeat that such an exercise of discretion inevitably involves a\n                    broad-brushed exercise of judgment. 37     In coming to my decision, I took into account\n                    the following case precedents: (a)     InLai Wai Keong\n                            Eugene, the Court of Appeal affirmed a 15-year multiplier for\n                        a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 30 years, notwithstanding it noted\n                        that this was a bit low (see [43]). The plaintiff was 34 years old at the\n                        time of the accident. (b)     InHaifizul, the Court of Appeal\n                        affirmed an 18-year multiplier for a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 34\n                        years. The plaintiff was 29 years old at the time of the accident (see [72]\n                        and [76]). (c)     InTV Media Pte Ltd v De Cruz Andrea Heidiand another appeal [2004] 3 SLR(R) 543 (“TV\n                            Media”), the court awarded a 17-year multiplier for a\n                        plaintiff with a remaining life expectancy of 51 years. The plaintiff was 27\n                        years old when her liver failed. (d)     InTan Juay Mui (by his next friend\n                            Chew Chwee Kim) v Sher Kuan Hock and another (Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd,\n                            co-defendant; Liberty Insurance Pte Ltd and another, third\n                            parties)[2012] 3 SLR 496 (“Tan\n                            Juay Mui”), the court affirmed a 17-year multiplier\n                        for a plaintiff with a life expectancy of 32 years. (e)     InAng Leng Hock v\n                            Leo Ee Ah[2004] 2 SLR(R) 361, a 15-year multiplier (reduced\n                        from 20) was awarded to a plaintiff with a life expectancy of approximately\n                        25 to 30 years. The plaintiff was 41 years old at the time of the\n                        accident. 38     I observe that courts seem to generally award\n                    a multiplier that is roughly half of the plaintiff’s expected life\n                    expectancy. In making this observation, I do not intend in any way to lay down a\n                    rule. The circumstances of a particular case may justify deviations and indeed,\n                    “outliers” such asTV Mediado\n                    exist. 39     Based on the authorities, the AR’s\n                    decision on the multiplier of 12-years cannot be said to be wrong as a matter of\n                    principle. Nevertheless, I repeat that in the appeals before me, I am entitled\n                    to exercise my discretion afresh. Due deference need only be paid to the\n                    AR’s judgment where findings of fact based on oral evidence are concerned.\n                    The decision on the multiplier certainly was not based on any oral evidence\n                    heard by the AR. Bearing in mind the general facts of the present case and the\n                    past decisions, the appropriate multiplier in my judgment, is 14\n                years. 40     I thus allow the Plaintiff’s appeal (in\n                    part), and find that the appropriate multiplier for the Plaintiff’s future\n                    expensesgenerallyshould be 14 years, and not 12\n                    years.",
        "Future medical expenses": "41     The AR awarded the Plaintiff $317,380.75 for\n                    future medical expenses. For clarity, I cite the breakdown of the AR’s\n                    award for future medical expenses found at [97] of the AR’s\n                    Judgment: ItemAwardTenotomy$5,000Botox and baclofen\n                                            infusion$12,000Treatment for skin pressure\n                                            ulcers$17,000Treatment\n                                                for upper respiratory tract infections\n                                                (“URTI”)$175,728Treatment\n                                                for pneumonia$31,564.75Physiotherapy\n                                    session$50,688Limb\n                                                splints$2,400Wheelchair$12,000Modifications required to\n                                            prevent skin pressure sores – hospital bed and\n                                            special mattress$6,000Medical\n                                                consultations$3,000Closure of tracheostomy\n                                            hole$2,000Total$317,380.75   42     The Plaintiff is only appealing against the\n                    awards highlighted in bold. Obviously, his main complaint is that the quantum\n                    awarded by the AR is too low for various reasons. The Plaintiff additionally\n                    appeals against the AR’s failure to award any damages for outpatient\n                    medication. The Defendant is not appealing against the AR’s award for\n                    future medical expenses. 43     I shall consider the Plaintiff’s appeal\n                    on future medical expenses in the following order: (a)     limb splints; (b)     treatment for\n                    pneumonia; (c)     physiotherapy sessions; and (d)     outpatient medication. 44     It may have been noted that I did not include\n                    in the above outline the appeal relating to the costs for the treatment for\n                    URTI, the wheelchair, and medical consultations. This is because the\n                    Plaintiff’s appeal in relation to those three aspects of future medical\n                    expenses relatesonlyto the appropriate\n                    multiplier to be applied. The Plaintiff only objects to the AR’s award on\n                    the grounds that she applied a 12-year multiplier, rather than their desired\n                    16-year multiplier. Given that I have already decided that the appropriate\n                    multiplier for future expenses is 14 years, there is no need for me to further\n                    discuss the Plaintiff’s appeal on the costs for treatment for URTI, the\n                    wheelchair, and medical consultations. I make the following awards in relation\n                    to these three items: (a)     For treatment for URTI, I award the\n                        Plaintiff $205,016 instead of the $175,728 awarded by the AR. I derive the\n                        figure in the following way: $523 x 4 days x 7 admissions per year x 14 years =\n                            $205,016 (b)     For wheelchair costs, I award the Plaintiff $14,000 instead of the\n                        $12,000 awarded by the AR. I derive the figure in the following way: $5,000 per wheelchair x (14-year multiplier / 5 years) =\n                            $14,000 (c)     For medical consultations, I award the Plaintiff $3,500 instead of\n                        the $3,000 awarded by the AR. The evidence was that the rates of each\n                        medical review would cost about $100 to $150 for a private hospital. The AR\n                        therefore took the average rate of $125 in her calculations. Further, this\n                        rate was to be discounted by 50% to reflect lowered rates in restructured\n                        hospitals (see [61] of the AR’s Judgment). Bearing the above numbers\n                        in mind, I derive the figure in the following way: 50% x $125 x 4 medical consultations a year x 14 years =\n                            $3,500 45     I now proceed to deal with the other types of\n                    future medical expenses.",
        "Limb splints": "46     The AR awarded $2,400 for limb splints on the\n                    basis that Dr Keith Goh estimated the cost of each limb splint to be in the\n                    range of $100 and $300. She therefore used the sum of $200 as the average cost\n                    of each limb splint. Because these rates were the rates at private hospitals, a\n                    50% discount was applied. Each limb splint was therefore estimated to be $100\n                    (being 50% of $200). The medical evidence was that the Plaintiff would require\n                    four limb splints every two years. Thus, using a multiplier of 12 years, the AR\n                    calculated the future medical expense on limb splints as follows: $100 per limb splint x 4 limb splints x (12-year\n                            multiplier / 2 years) = $2,400 47     On appeal, the Plaintiff objects to the\n                    multiplier used, as well as the cost of $100 ascribed to each limb splint. The\n                    Plaintiff submits that the multiplier should be 16 years, and the cost of each\n                    limb splint should be $150, being half of the maximum cost of\n                $300. 48     I see no basis for departing from the\n                    AR’s calculation of the cost of each limb splint. The medical evidence is\n                    clear that each limb splint costs an average of $100 to $300 at private\n                    hospitals (see [56] of the AR’s Judgment). The Plaintiff does not dispute\n                    this in his submissions. Rather, the Plaintiff simply asks that the court uses\n                    the “maximum range” of $300 in awarding damages. There is no basis\n                    to do so. The Plaintiff has given me no reason to assume that the limb splints\n                    he will need will all cost $300 or close to $300. 49     Therefore, taking into account a modified\n                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $2,800 for limb splints. I derive the\n                    figure in the following way: $100 per limb splint x 4 limb splints x (14-year\n                            multiplier / 2 years) = $2,800.",
        "Treatment for pneumonia": "50     In determining the future medical expenses\n                    that should be awarded for the Plaintiff’s pneumonia treatment, the AR\n                    allowed for seven incidences of pneumonia across the rest of the\n                    Plaintiff’s life. This was reduced from the medical expert estimate of 10\n                    incidences across the remaining 27 years of the Plaintiff’s life to take\n                    into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. The AR then took into\n                    account the medical evidence that each incident of pneumonia would require about\n                    seven to 10 days of hospitalisation. She therefore took the average of 8.5 days.\n                    She determined that hospitalisation costs $523 per day. 51     Oddly though, she calculated the award for\n                    pneumonia treatment as follows (see [90] of the AR’s Judgment): $530.50 x 8.5 days x 7 incidences =\n                        $31,564.75 52     I say the calculation is odd, because the AR\n                    used $530.50 rather than $523 as the hospitalisation costs per day. The\n                    Plaintiff noted this discrepancy in his submissions, but said nothing more about\n                    it. The Defendant is not appealing against this calculation. I therefore leave\n                    this oddity for a moment to consider the crux of the Plaintiff’s appeal on\n                    this matter. 53     On appeal, the Plaintiff submits the\n                    following: (a)     The cost of hospitalisation per day\n                        should be $1046 based on Dr David Low’s estimate that each admission\n                        for pneumonia would cost about twice as much as URTI (see [90] of the\n                        AR’s Judgment). (b)     The AR should have allowed for 10 incidences, rather than seven\n                        incidences of pneumonia, because 10 times is a “reasonable\n                        estimate” over a remaining period of 27 years and is a more\n                        “cautionary stand”. 54     In his oral submissions before me, the\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel seemed to have conceded his appeal on this point. The\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel voluntarily conceded that when Dr David Low said\n                    treatment for pneumonia would cost about twice as much as treatment for URTI, he\n                    did not know how much treatment for URTI costs. Of course, I have no evidence to\n                    this effect. I do not know the basis upon which the Plaintiff’s counsel\n                    asserts that Dr Low did not know the cost of URTI treatment in making that\n                    statement. 55     Nevertheless, I note that in the AR’s\n                    Judgment at [90], she stated … This estimate was also in line with Dr David Low’s estimate\n                        that each admission for pneumonia is usually longer than that of URTI andwould cost about twice as much.\n                        … [emphasis added] 56     It seems to me that a logical way to make\n                    sense of Dr David Low’s statement is that treatment for pneumonia costs\n                    twice as muchbecauseit normally involves a\n                    hospitalisation stay of twice the length of that of URTI treatment. The\n                    Plaintiff’s initial interpretation that the cost of hospitalisation per\n                    day for pneumonia treatment is double that of URTI treatment has no basis in the\n                    evidence. 57     In any case, as I have noted, the\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel seems to have conceded his first point on appeal.\n                    Therefore, I need not say any more on this. 58     On the number of incidences of pneumonia that\n                    the court should award future medical expenses for, the key question is whether\n                    the AR should have discounted the number of incidences indicated by the medical\n                    experts to take into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. The\n                    Plaintiff made no submissions on the correctness of discounting the number of\n                    incidences to take into account accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. He\n                    simply submits that 10 is a “reasonable estimate”, and is more\n                    “cautionary”. 59     No one doubts that 10 incidences of pneumonia\n                    is a reasonable estimate. This estimate is based on medical evidence which the\n                    AR herself accepted in her judgment. I also do not see how the submission on\n                    caution assists me in deciding whether a discount should be applied. Of course,\n                    the higher the number, the more “cautionary” the award would\n                    naturally be from the Plaintiff’s perspective. But this cannot mean that I\n                    award the Plaintiff damages for as high a number of incidences of pneumonia that\n                    I reasonably can. This would be unfair to the Defendant. 60     On balance, apart from the fact that the AR\n                    wrongly used the figure of “$530.50” instead of\n                    “$523” as the daily hospitalisation rate, I do not see anything\n                    wrong with the AR applying a discount to the number of incidences of pneumonia\n                    on account of accelerated payment and vicissitudes of life. This seems to be in\n                    accordance with well-established principles on discounting damages awarded in\n                    view of the fact that a plaintiff often receives an award in one lump sum,\n                    upfront. I therefore revise the AR’s award for pneumonia treatment to\n                    $31,118.50 ($523 x 8.5 days x 7 incidences = $31,118.50).",
        "Physiotherapy sessions": "61     The evidence shows that the Plaintiff will\n                    need physiotherapy on a regular basis for the rest of his life. However, the\n                    Plaintiff will also need more intensive physiotherapy after his tenotomy\n                    surgeries. The AR allowed for two physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of\n                    the Plaintiff’s life. I set out her reasoning on this (at [91]–[92]\n                    of the AR’s Judgment): 91    Both Professor Ong and Dr David Low expressed the\n                            view that it was fair to rely on the historical data derived from the\n                            plaintiff’s previous rehabilitation sessions as a guide to\n                            estimate how frequently the plaintiff should attend physiotherapy.\n                            Professor Ong was of the view that a provision of about two\n                            physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the plaintiff’s\n                            future was fair.Dr David Low testified that during\n                                the period of intensification of rehabilitation, the number of\n                                sessions could be about two to four times a month, but this would\n                                reduce to the historical baseline of about 1.5 sessions a month\n                                after the period of intensive\n                        rehabilitation. 92    As such, I allowed for an estimation of two\n                            physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the plaintiff’s\n                            life… [emphasis added] 62     It is clear that the AR took into account the\n                    need for more intense physiotherapy in awarding the Plaintiff damages for two\n                    physiotherapy sessions a month. 63     On appeal, the Plaintiff submits the\n                    following: (a)     The AR wrongly failed to make an\n                        award for the more intensive physiotherapy sessions needed after the two\n                        tenotomy surgeries. (b)     In the alternative, if the AR did factor in the need for more\n                        intensive physiotherapy in her overall award of two physiotherapy sessions\n                        per month, this is insufficient. 64     It is clear that the first submission is\n                    wrong. As I stated above, the AR did consider the need for more intensive\n                    rehabilitation after the tenotomy procedures in her award. In support of his\n                    alternative submission, the Plaintiff highlighted to the court that after each\n                    tenotomy surgery, “Professor Ong recommended 3 to 5 times a week and Dr\n                    Low recommended 2 to 4 times a month for an intensified period of 3 to 6\n                    months”. The Plaintiff took the position that two physiotherapy sessions\n                    a month was the appropriate award for “usual rehabilitation”. An\n                    additional award must be given above and beyond the two monthly sessions for the\n                    “intensified period”. The Plaintiff submitted that in determining\n                    this additional award, the court should take the average of the highest medical\n                    estimate (ie, five times a week or 20 times a\n                    month) and the lowest medical estimate (ie, two\n                    times a month), which is 11 times a month. 65     On the whole, I find many problems with the\n                    Plaintiff’s submissions. I uphold the AR’s award of two sessions per\n                    month for the following reasons: (a)     The Plaintiff has no basis to submit\n                        that two physiotherapy sessions a month is the appropriate award for\n                        “usual rehabilitation”. The AR cited medical evidence from Dr\n                        David Low that 1.5 sessions per month is the “historical\n                        baseline”. The Plaintiff did not dispute this in his\n                    appeal. (b)     The award\n                        of two physiotherapy sessions per month for the rest of the\n                        Plaintiff’s life is already very generous. This is an additional 162\n                        sessions above the usual 1.5 sessions a month (0.5 additional session per\n                        month x 12 months x 27 years = 162). This is far more than the\n                        Plaintiff’s estimate of the 99 additional physiotherapy sessions\n                        needed for post tetonomy recovery. (c)     The Plaintiff has cited no proof that Professor Ong\n                        recommends three to five sessions of additional rehabilitationa week. The AR cited Dr Low’s estimate of two\n                        to four sessions a month during the intensification period, and Professor\n                        Ong’s estimate of two physiotherapy sessions per month for the rest of\n                        the Plaintiff’s life. I will not disturb the AR’s finding\n                        without more concrete evidence that her award is\n                erroneous. 66     Moreover, while this is not necessary to my\n                    decision, I point out that if the Plaintiff were correct, the estimates given by\n                    Professor Ong and Dr Low seem vastly at odds with each other. The former\n                    estimates 12 to 20 sessions a month, while the latter only two to four. If I had\n                    to decide this for myself, I would have had to decide which estimate is right.\n                    Taking the average of the highest estimate (20) and the lowest estimate (two) as\n                    proposed by the Plaintiff does not seem to me to be the correct approach to\n                    take. 67     In any case, given the Defendant did not\n                    appeal on this, and there is no doubt in my mind that the AR’s award of\n                    two physiotherapy sessions per month is fair and reasonable, I shall not disturb\n                    the AR’s finding that on the whole, two physiotherapy sessions per month\n                    should be awarded. 68     The Plaintiff also makes the point that the\n                    multiplier used to calculate the award for physiotherapy sessions should not be\n                    12 years. On this, I agree that the AR’s award must be altered in light of\n                    my holding that the appropriate multiplier for future expenses generally is 14\n                    years. 69     Therefore, taking into account a modified\n                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $59,136 for physiotherapy sessions. I\n                    derive the figure in the following way: $176 per session x 2 sessions x 12 months x 14-year\n                            multiplier = $59,136",
        "Outpatient medication": "70     The Plaintiff submits that the AR omitted to\n                    award damages for outpatient medication, necessary after hospitalisation for\n                    URTI and pneumonia. To assist the court in calculating the quantum of outpatient\n                    medication, the Plaintiff submits the following facts: (a)     The cost for outpatient medication\n                        is between $10 and $20 per day. (b)     One week of outpatient medication is necessary after each\n                        hospitalisation. 71     On that basis, the Plaintiff submits that\n                    $7,840 should be awarded for post-URTI medication, and $700 should be awarded\n                    for post-pneumonia medication. I reproduce the table the Plaintiff put in his\n                    submissions to explain how the figures were calculated: URTIPneumoniaCost of medication per\n                                            day$10 (after 50%\n                                            discount)$10 (after 50%\n                                            discount)Number of\n                                    days7 days7 daysNumber of\n                                        incidences7 incidences per\n                                        year10 incidences per lifetimeMultiplier16-Total$7840$700   72     I note that no evidence was offered to the\n                    court on any of the above figures. I find this rather unsatisfactory. However,\n                    during the hearing before me, the Defendant concedes outpatient medication\n                    appears to have been missed out by the AR, and did not object to either the\n                    award or the quantum of outpatient medication claimed by the Plaintiff. I\n                    therefore assume that the parties agree on the accuracy of the above\n                    figures. 73     On my part, in fairness to the Defendant, I\n                    would make the following amendments to the figures the Plaintiff proposed based\n                    on the facts I have before me: (a)     On the Plaintiff’s own case,\n                        the cost of medication per day ranges from $10 to $20. The average cost of\n                        medication per day is therefore $15. While the Plaintiff does not explain\n                        why he applies a 50% discount in the table he submits, I assume this is\n                        because the figures he submits are based on private rates rather than\n                        restructured hospital rates. I would award $7.50 per day for medication\n                        rather than $10 on the basis that there is no justification in using the\n                        upper limit of the cost of medication. (b)     As decided previously, taking into account accelerated\n                        payment and vicissitudes of life, the number of incidences of pneumonia\n                        which the court will award damages for is seven, not 10. (c)     The appropriate multiplier to apply is\n                        14, not 16. 74     I therefore award the Plaintiff a total of\n                    $5,512.50 for outpatient medication. I shall use the table format used by the\n                    Plaintiff to explain how I derived the above figure: URTIPneumoniaCost of medication per\n                                            day$7.50 (after 50%\n                                            discount)$7.50 (after 50%\n                                            discount)Number of\n                                    days7 days7 daysNumber of\n                                        incidences7 incidences per\n                                        year7 incidences in the\n                                            Plaintiff’s lifetimeMultiplier14-Total$5,145$367.50Grand\n                                    total$5,512.50",

        "Cost of future nursing care": "77     There are two aspects to the award for future\n                    nursing care. The first concerns a full-time stay home domestic helper. The\n                    second concerns a private or auxiliary nurse that would be engaged for one month\n                    each year to give the main caregivers (ie, the\n                    mother and the domestic helper) some time off. This is to prevent caregiver\n                    burnout.",
        "Domestic helper": "78     The AR took into account the following costs\n                    involved in hiring a domestic helper: (a)     $480 for monthly\n                    salary; (b)     $83.85 for\n                        monthly maid levy; (c)     $80 monthly for food, medical bills and lodging; (d)     $200 contract renewal fee once every\n                        two years; (e)     $300\n                        return air ticket once every two years; and (f)     $321 for insurance premiums payable once every\n                        two years. 79     The AR deemed it appropriate to apply a 50%\n                    discount to the total cost of the domestic helper because she spends half her\n                    time doing household chores. Using a 12-year multiplier, the AR arrived at a\n                    global sum of $48,820.20 as expenses of hiring a domestic helper. 80     The Plaintiff appeals against the 50% discount\n                    applied as well as the 12-year multiplier. I have already determined that the\n                    appropriate multiplier should be 14 years. The only issue left for me to\n                    determine is whether the 50% discount was correctly applied. On this, the\n                    Plaintiff submits the following: (a)     The consensus of the medical experts\n                        is that the Plaintiff needs two caregivers and auxiliary help for the rest\n                        of his life. (b)     The maid was engaged for the predominant purpose of assisting the\n                        Plaintiff’s mother take care of the Plaintiff. (c)     While it is not denied that the maid\n                        helps out with household work, she does so only from time to time. Moreover,\n                        the maid’s involvement in the Plaintiff’s care would inevitably\n                        increase as the Plaintiff grows in size and weight. 81     I agree with the Plaintiff that no discount\n                    should be applied to the award for the cost of hiring a domestic helper. It is\n                    clear that the need for a domestic helper arose solely because of the accident.\n                    It may well be true that the domestic worker helps out with house work. However,\n                    it must be borne in mind that the mother is now a full-time care-giver for the\n                    Plaintiff and this obviously has an impact on her own ability to perform house\n                    work. The need to hire a domestic helper to help out in the areas she does is,\n                    in my view, entirely necessitated by the accident. 82     Moreover, I am fortified in my view by the\n                    medical evidence that the Plaintiff needstwo\n                        caregivers. It thus seems to me entirely fair to award the\n                    Plaintiff thefull costof two caregivers\n                        (ie, the domestic helper and the mother). As\n                    such, I find that a 50% discount should not have been applied to the award for\n                    the cost of a domestic helper. 83     Therefore, taking into account a modified\n                    14-year multiplier, I award the Plaintiff $113,913.80 for the cost of a domestic\n                    helper. I derive the figure in the following way: ($480 + $83.85 + $80) x 12 months x 14-year multiplier =\n                            $108,166.80 ($200 + $300 + $321) x 14-year multiplier / 2 years =\n                            $5,747 Total = $108,166.80 + $5,747 = $113,913.80",
        "Private nurse": "84     The Plaintiff’s appeal on the quantum\n                    awarded for the private nurse relates both to the multiplicand and the\n                    multiplier. I have already decided that the appropriate multiplier is 14 years\n                    not 12 years. Moreover, I see no reason to disturb the AR’s decision to\n                    use $160 as the multiplicand. The AR saw it fit to take the average of the\n                    lowest end of the defendant’s estimate of the cost of a private nurse\n                        (ie$100) and the plaintiff’s estimate\n                    of the said cost (ie$220). The Plaintiff has\n                    provided no reasons for me to believe that this is erroneous. I therefore only\n                    revise the multiplier adopted by the AR, and award the Plaintiff $67,200 for the\n                    cost of a private nurse hired for a duration of one full month each year. I\n                    derive the figure in the following way: $160 per day x 30 days a month x 14-year multiplier =$67,200",
        "Conclusion on cost of future nursing care": "85     In total, the amount awarded for cost of\n                    future nursing care is $181,113.80 (being $113,913.80 + $67,200).",
        "Mother’s loss of future earnings": "86     The Plaintiff’s mother has since stopped\n                    work and become a full-time caregiver to the Plaintiff. While this is\n                    undoubtedly a significant drain on her, the AR correctly noted that under this\n                    head of damage, we are concerned not with loss to the mother, but loss tothe Plaintiff:Lee Wei Kong\n                        (by his litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong[2012] 2 SLR 85 (“Lee Wei Kong\n                    (CA)”) at [53]. 87     It bears repeating that the evidence\n                    establishes that the Plaintiff needs two caregivers, and that his mother is one\n                    of them. The Defendant thus should rightfully pay the cost oftwo caregivers. An award for one of the caregivers,ie, the domestic helper, has already been considered\n                    above. I now consider the award that should be given as costs of the second\n                    caregiver, the Plaintiff’s mother. The difficulty here is that in reality,\n                    this care is provided gratuitously to the Plaintiff. As such, the Plaintiff does\n                    not actually incur any expense from having to depend on his mother for full-time\n                    caregiving. While there is some controversy over whether damages should be\n                    awarded tothe Plaintifffor the gratuitous care\n                    he receives from friends or family (see for example the English position inHunt v Severs[1994] 2 AC 350\n                        (“Hunt v Severs”)), there is\n                    sufficient authority for the proposition that a reasonable value of that care\n                    should be awarded to the Plaintiff as damages:Donnelly v\n                        Joyce[1974] 1 QB 454 (“Donnelly v\n                        Joyce”),Lee Wei Kong (CA)at [53]. Moreover, both parties accept this as a correct proposition in\n                    law. 88     I note that whilst the House of Lords inHunt v Seversdid overruleDonnelly v Joyce, this was in respect of the holding in the\n                    latter case that it was irrelevant to consider the identity of the source from\n                    which the need for nursing or care services was met. InHunt\n                        v Severs, the House of Lords held that where the provider of the\n                    nursing or care services is thetortfeasor, there\n                    was no ground in public policy to require the tortfeasor to pay damages to the\n                    Plaintiff in respect of services which he himself has rendered. This was because\n                    the House of Lords took the view that the underlying rationale of awarding\n                    damages on this front is to enable the voluntary carer to receive proper\n                    recompense for the services. That being so, the House of Lords’ conclusion\n                    was that a plaintiff who recovers damages under this head should hold them on\n                    trust for the voluntary carer. 89     Indeed, I note that regardless of the\n                    controversy in England about whether such damages for such services should be\n                    held on trust for the caregiver, the position in Singapore is that the plaintiff\n                    may directly recover the reasonable value of such gratuitous services rendered\n                    as damages. In any case, this issue was never raised by the parties in the\n                    appeal and I therefore need not explore it any further. 90     The authorities establish that to compute the\n                    reasonable costs of obtaining the care his mother provides, the court will look\n                    at the mother’s loss of earnings as thestarting\n                        point:Lee Wei Kong (CA)at [63].\n                    In other words, the multiplicand adopted is based on the mother’s monthly\n                    income. This is not in dispute on appeal. What is in dispute is the sum which\n                    should be imputed as the mother’s monthly income. 91     The AR adopted the multiplicand of $1,508 per\n                    month in computing the mother’s loss of future earnings. This was based on\n                    the mother’s last drawn salary before the accident. At that time, she was\n                    working as a receptionist at a law firm drawing a monthly salary of $1,300 with\n                    employer’s CPF contributions of $208 per month. 92     The gravamen of the Defendant’s\n                    complaint is that the AR wrongly used the mother’s last drawn salary as\n                    the multiplicand. The Defendant submits that the evidence strongly suggests that\n                    the mother would have stopped working. The evidence includes the\n                        following[note: 1]: (a)     The Plaintiff’s mother\n                        admitted in cross-examination on 10 December 2013 that it was her\n                        inclination to stay at home and look after the children even if the accident\n                        did not happen. While she did change her testimony when examined on 13\n                        December 2013 to say that she intended to work her whole life, the Defendant\n                        submits that this is untruthful, self-serving testimony. (b)     The Plaintiff’s mother’s\n                        history of employment suggests that she only works during periods when her\n                        husband is irresponsible and is not earning a wage to support the family\n                        (she has had three husbands so far). Her present husband earns a wage to\n                        support the family. This suggests the Plaintiff’s mother is likely to\n                        have left her job even if the accident did not take\n                    place. (c)     Since 1992,\n                        the time she left school to enter the workforce, the Plaintiff’s\n                        mother has only worked for approximately eight years. 93     Based on the above evidence, the Defendant\n                    submits that the appropriate multiplicand to adopt is that which is adopted for\n                    homemakers. According to the Defendant, on the authority ofToon Chee Meng Eddie v Yeap Chin Hon[1993] 1 SLR(R) 407\n                        (“Eddie Toon”), this is a figure\n                    of about $300. I note that the AR did consider this submission in her judgment,\n                    but dismissed it on the ground of other authorities which suggest that the court\n                    should not presume the mother would eventually quit work and stay at\n                    home. 94     From the above, two issues arise for my\n                    consideration: (a)     In assessing the cost of care based\n                        on loss of future earnings, to what extent should the court speculate\n                        whether a caregiver who was working at the time of the accident would\n                        continue to work had the accident not taken place? (b)     To what extent should the cost of a\n                        caregiver’s care be assessed based on his or her loss of future\n                        earnings? Related to that, how should we compute the cost of a\n                        homemaker’s caregiving?",
        "Speculation about a caregiver’s continued employment": "95     The starting point of this inquiry is the\n                    objective of achieving a fair and reasonable assessment of the loss incurred by\n                    the Plaintiff in having been reduced to a state where he requires his\n                    mother’s full-time care. Naturally, the court needs to be fully apprised\n                    of all relevant facts. 96     Where the full-time nursing care is provided\n                    by a homemaker, it is established that the court should endeavour to award a\n                    reasonable and fair value to the Plaintiff as damages.Eddie\n                        Toonis relied on by the Defendant for the proposition that the\n                    appropriate multiplicand in such a case is the figure generally adopted for\n                    homemakers (around $300 per month). On the other hand, where full-time nursing\n                    care is provided by an income-earning parent (who had to give up work), the\n                    Plaintiff asserts that the assessment is generally based on the income which\n                    that parent earned but can no longer earn. This may well be considerably more\n                    than the figure that is said to have been generally adopted for\n                    homemakers. 97     I pause here to note that many factual\n                    permutations can arise. In some cases, it may be that a homemaker parent who now\n                    provides the full-time nursing care is a well-qualified professional who\n                    intended to return to the work-force in a few years. Nevertheless, at the time\n                    of the accident and hearing, that parent had not yet returned to work. In other\n                    cases, it may be that the full-time nursing care is provided by a high-income\n                    earning parent who has since had to give up his or her job to stay home and look\n                    after the severely injured and disabled child. It goes without saying that the\n                    income of that parent may be higher than the cost of engaging a full-time\n                    professional home nurse. The point made is that it follows that evidence on the\n                    following factsare relevant(at the minimum) to\n                    determine the cost of a caregiver’s care where such care is gratuitously\n                    provided to the Plaintiff: (a)     Was the caregiver gainfully employed\n                        prior to the provision of gratuitous care? (b)     What were the caregiver’s employment\n                        prospects, and related to that, whether there was any likelihood that the\n                        homemaker turned caregiver would have entered the work-force in the future\n                        but for the injuries suffered by the plaintiff, (c)     If the caregiver had continued working, how much\n                        the care-giver would have earned as salary. (d)     The cost of engaging third-party full-time care,\n                        whether by means of a domestic helper (where this is appropriate given a\n                        plaintiff’s needs), a professional nurse, or institutionalised\n                        care. 98     This list may not be exhaustive – other\n                    factors may well be relevant. Whilst it may be said that the above fact finding\n                    exercise involves a good deal of “speculation”, it cannot be\n                    denied that the court is often compelled by the circumstances of the cases it\n                    hears, to make “considered” speculative findings of\n                fact. 99     Indeed, the AR considered the factual question\n                    of whether the Plaintiff’s mother would have continued working if the\n                    accident did not take place. From my reading of the AR’s Judgment, the\n                    conclusion was that there is insufficient evidence that the mother would have\n                    chosen to become a homemaker. In other words, the AR basically made a finding of\n                    fact that the motherwould have continued workingat her pre-accident salary of $1,508 per month (as per thestatus quobefore the accident) if the accident did not take\n                    place. It is to this factual finding that I now turn. 100    The AR stated at [107] of her judgment that\n                    “it was complete speculation on the part of the defendant to suggest that\n                    the mother would have chosen to be a homemaker”. She citedTeo Ai Ling (by her next friend Chua Wee Bee) v Koh Chai\n                        Kwang[2010] 2 SLR 1037 (“Teo Ai\n                        Ling”) at [74], where Steven Chong JC (as he then was)\n                    held: I am mindful that the plaintiff is a woman and that she may marry and stop\n                        work before the normal retirement age. However, as rightly observed by Chao\n                        J inPeh Diana([42]supra), the court cannot ignore the fact that the government\n                        is constantly encouraging women to join the workforce and to contribute\n                        positively to the economic growth of the country. Therefore, no reduction to\n                        the multiplier should be made on account of the fact that the plaintiff may\n                        stop work after marriage. … 101Teo Ai Lingrightly cautions the courts not to assume that women will stop worksimplybecause of their gender and the homemaker role a\n                    woman is traditionally thought to play. This is clearly correct. There is no\n                    basis for a court to assume that a caregiver is likely to quit her job just\n                    because of her gender. That said,Teo Ai Lingdoes\n                    not go so far as to state that it is never proper to take into account the\n                    continued employment prospects of the person who had to leave work to provide\n                    full-time care. For example, if there is clear evidence that the caregiver\n                    whilst employed at the time when the need for care arose, had already tendered a\n                    3-month resignation notice, such evidence should not be ignored. 102    I therefore turn to the actual evidence\n                    before me, and ask whether the Plaintiff’s mother would have stopped\n                    work. 103    I outlined the evidence that the Defendant\n                    would like me to take into account at [92] of this judgment. In my view, the\n                    evidence is insufficient to justify a finding of fact that the Plaintiff’s\n                    mother would have become a homemaker for the rest of her life even if the\n                    accident had not taken place. I accept that the Plaintiff’s mother has not\n                    consistently been in the workforce and that her present husband may be\n                    responsibly supporting the family. I also accept that she may personally prefer\n                    to be a homemaker if circumstances permit. However, she was holding a full-time\n                    job before the accident, and there is nothing to suggest that she would have\n                    quit in the near or foreseeable future. 104    In short, it is not possible to determine on\n                    a balance of probabilities that she would have quit her job if the accident had\n                    not taken place. Moreover, given that it is the AR who heard the evidence from\n                    the mother first hand, I find it appropriate to defer to her judgment that on\n                    the evidence, it was “complete speculation” to suggest the\n                    Plaintiff’s mother would have quit her job. There is no reason to disturb\n                    the AR’s factual finding. 105    It might fairly be said that evidence to\n                    positively support the fact that the Plaintiff’s mother would have\n                    continued working at a monthly salary of $1,508 if the accident did not take\n                    place is equally lacking. The Defendant points to the possibility that the\n                    Plaintiff’s mother may not have been able to keep such a well-paying job,\n                    as well as the fact that she might choose to quit her job (as previously\n                    mentioned). I fully accept that these are possibilities. However, it appears\n                    that thestarting pointthe courts have adopted in\n                    assessing the loss of future income as a result of an accident is the\n                    caregiver’s or the victim’spre-accident\n                        income: see for exampleDonnelly v\n                        Joyce, cited in approval inAng Eng Lee and\n                        another v Lim Lye Soon[1985-1986] SLR(R) 931 at [10] –\n                    [11]. 106    The court rightly tries to avoid speculation\n                    as to whether the caregiver or victim in question is likely to find a better\n                    job, to be fired, or to eventually quit her job. The starting point is that the\n                    pre-accidentstatus quois presumed to continue\n                    unless there is clear evidence to the contrary. It must follow that when a court\n                    is asked by the parties to make a finding of fact as to whether a particular\n                    victim or caregiver would have, on a balance of probabilities, continued in\n                    employment at a particular income, the court may start by assuming thatstatus quowould continue. It is for the other\n                    party to then displace this initial presumption with contrary evidence. In the\n                    present case, I affirm the AR’s decision that there is insufficient\n                    contrary evidence to displace the presumption that the pre-accidentstatus quowould have continued.",
        "Assessing the cost of a caregiver’s care": "107    I turn to the question of how the cost of a\n                    caregiver’s care should be quantified. Both parties proceeded on the\n                    assumption that this should be quantified with reference to the\n                    caregiver’s loss of income. This may well be correct in some, if not most,\n                    cases. The caregiver’s loss of income is thestarting\n                        pointin assessing the reasonable expense a plaintiff would have\n                    had to incur to obtain such care:Lee Wei Kong\n                        (CA)at [63]. The question, however, is whether there are other\n                    factors a court should take into account in determining the reasonable expense a\n                    plaintiff would have had to incur to obtain the gratuitous care he has received\n                    from his family. 108    If a successful private banker who draws a\n                    monthly salary of $50,000 leaves her employment to provide full-time care to her\n                    son who has been severely injured and disabled. Can the court properly award her\n                    son damages of $50,000 per month as compensation for her cost of care? This\n                    would seem unfair and unreasonable to the tortfeasor. Indeed, this sentiment was\n                    expressed by Kan Ting Chiu J inLee Wei Kong (by his\n                        litigation representative Lee Swee Chit) v Ng Siok Tong[2010]\n                    SGHC 371 (“Lee Wei Kong (HC)”). Kan\n                    J (at [29]) held that while claims for a caregiver’s loss of earnings have\n                    been allowed, they must be reasonable: … For these losses to be recovered, however, they have to be\n                        reasonable. If a mother gives up a $10,000 monthly salary to look after a\n                        child instead of employing a maid or a nurse, then the recoverable loss\n                        should be based on the cost of employment of a maid or nurse and not the\n                        mother’s salary. 109    WhileLee Wei Kong\n                        (HC)has been substantially overturned by the Court of Appeal inLee Wei Kong (CA), I note that the abovedictawas not disapproved of, and remains\n                    instructive (seeLee Wei Kong (CA)at\n                    [63]–[64]). 110    Indeed, the abovedictawas cited inTan Teck Boon v Lee Gim\n                        Siong and others[2011] SGHC 76 at [25], where the learned\n                    assistant registrar adopted Kan J’s approach of awarding the cost of\n                    alternatively employing a maid or a nurse where evidence on the victim’s\n                    father’s pre-accident income was wholly inadequate. 111Chong Hwa Yin (committee\n                        of person an estate of Chong Hwa Wee, mentally disordered) v Estate of Loh\n                        Hon Fock, deceased[2006] 3 SLR(R) 208 (“Chong Hwa Yin”) is also of some guidance. Choo\n                    Han Teck J held (at [11]) that a problem with the assistant registrar’s\n                    method of assessing the mother’s cost of care in that case was that the mother’s income as a rubber tapper was accepted as the costs of\n                        nursing care. If there was no evidence of what nursing care would cost this\n                        item could not be allowed using a rubber tapper’s, or any other,\n                        income as the gauge. 112    Choo J seems to suggest by this that one\n                    cannotexclusivelyrefer to the caregiver’s\n                    loss of income in determining his or her cost of care. Regard must be had to the\n                    cost of nursing care generally. It is not clear from his judgment however, how\n                    the cost of nursing care would have been taken into account in making the final\n                    compensatory award. It is also not clear whether “the mother’s\n                    income as a rubber tapper” would still have been relevant if there was\n                    evidence of the general cost of nursing care. 113    The final local case I consider on this\n                    point isEddie Toon. InEddie\n                        Toon, the learned assistant registrar had awarded the plaintiff a\n                    sum of $480,600 for future nursing care. The award was based on there being two\n                    stages of care. The first is when the plaintiff is nursed at home with home\n                    nursing care in the day as well as full-time parental care. The second is when\n                    the plaintiff’s parents are no longer able to take care of him. The\n                    breakdown of the assistant registrar’s award for future nursing care was\n                    as follows (seeEddie Toonat\n                    [30]–[32]): (a)     $405,000 – costs ofhome nursing careduring the first stage using a\n                        multiplier of 9 years, and a multiplicand of $125 a day, which is the daily\n                        cost of engaging a private nurse. (b)     $32,400 – the cost of themother’s servicesduring the first stage in lieu of a\n                        private nurse who should be employed for the night shift. A multiplicand of\n                        $300 per month was used. (c)     $43,200 – the cost ofinstitutional nursing careduring the second stage when the\n                        plaintiff’s parents can no longer take care of him. A multiplier of 6\n                        years and a multiplicand of $1,500 per month were used (with a 60% deduction\n                        for the “domestic element”, being the cost of food and\n                        accommodation the Plaintiff would have had to incur even without the\n                        accident). 114    The defendant in that case appealed against\n                    the award of $405,000 for home nursing care, arguing that it was not reasonable\n                    for the plaintiff to be cared for at home given the significantly greater costs.\n                    What is of especial importance is the approach Goh Phai Cheng JC took on\n                    appeal. 115    Goh JC first established that the burden of\n                    proving that it is reasonable for the plaintiff to be cared for at home lay on\n                    the plaintiff:Eddie Toonat [34]. He then found\n                    that engaging a private nurse for the purposes of providing home nursing care\n                    during the first stage of care was not a reasonable expense. He reasoned that\n                    institutional nursing care was a viable option because the plaintiff’s\n                    mother could attend to him daily if she wished:Eddie\n                        Toonat [36]. Moreover, if the plaintiff’s mother wished to\n                    continue to care for the plaintiff at home, she could engage a maid to assist\n                    her. Engaging a private nurse was not necessary because the plaintiff’s\n                    mother had been providing excellent nursing care to the plaintiff from the time\n                    of the accident till the date of the assessment:Eddie\n                        Toonat [37]. 116    Goh JC then calculated the appropriate award\n                    for future nursing care assuming the plaintiff was cared for at home with the\n                    assistance of a domestic maid, and found this to come up to a global figure of\n                    $141,000:Eddie Toonat [40]. He calculated the\n                    alternative award assuming the plaintiff received institutional nursing care for\n                    the rest of his life (ie, during both the first\n                    and the second stages of care). He provided for the travelling expenses the\n                    plaintiff’s mother would incur in making daily visits to the nursing home,\n                    and found that this would produce an aggregate sum of $162,000:Eddie Toonat [41]–[44]. Having arrived at the two\n                    figures, Goh JC, referring to the award of $162,000, held at [44]: … Since this award is higher than the award which I have arrived at\n                        as the costs of future nursing care on the basis that the plaintiff would be\n                        looked after by his parents until such time as they are not able to do so,\n                        and for him to be looked after in a private nursing home when his parents\n                        are unable to care for him, I am of the view that the plaintiff should be\n                        awarded the sum of $162,000 for future nursing care. 117    Based on the reasoning above, Goh JC set\n                    aside the assistant registrar’s award of $480,600 and substituted it with\n                    an award of $162,000. Two points may be gleaned from Goh JC’s analysis inEddie Toon: (a)     First, the court will apply a test\n                        of reasonableness in determining the type of nursing care the plaintiff may\n                        be compensated for. Hence, where one mode of care (eg, home nursing care) is far costlier than other equivalent\n                        modes of care, the court will be reluctant to calculate compensation on that\n                        basis. This is in line with Kan J’sdictainLee Wei Kong (HC).\n                        Even so, I note in passing that in assessing the home-care option as opposed\n                        to institutional care, the court must have regard to any non-monetary\n                        advantages of home-care by a private nurse or a parent. (b)     Second, the court will not\n                        necessarily determine the award for the future cost of nursing care based on\n                        thecheapestpossible mode of care. It is not\n                        clear why, of the two reasonable alternative modes of care, Goh JC decided\n                        to base his award on the more costly mode of care (ie, on the assumption of institutional nursing care). That\n                        said, the court must consider all the possible reasonable nursing care\n                        options the plaintiff has before deciding on the basis upon which it makes\n                        its award. Indeed, this seems to have been the point Choo J was making inChong Hwa Yinat\n                [11]. 118    One important question that arises, and that\n                    both parties to the present appeal made submissions on, is how to value a\n                    parent’s gratuitous caregiving. This is important when a court is\n                    assessing the range of reasonable options available, and is deciding on the cost\n                    to impute on a parent’s full-time care-giving as a possible option of\n                    care.Lee Wei Kong (CA)suggests quite clearly\n                    that the parent’s loss of income is an appropriate measure. However, this\n                    leaves open the question how an assessment may be made if the caregiver was\n                    previously unemployed and was performing the role as a homemaker. Strictly\n                    relying on the loss of income as the measure of a caregiver’s gratuitous\n                    caregiving would result in the homemaker’s care having at most a nominal\n                    value. 119    The Defendant submits that this is in fact\n                    the case, and relies onEddie Toonas authority\n                    for this. The Defendant argues that Goh JC awarded the mother, who was a\n                    homemaker, a nominal figure of only $300 per month for her care of the\n                    plaintiff. I point out that this is not entirely accurate. The sum of $300 was\n                    only awarded for the mother’s services in lieu of a private nurseat night. While it is arguable that the court\n                    may have ultimately omitted to make an award for the cost of the mother’s\n                    carein the day(given it rejected awarding the\n                    plaintiff the cost of a private nurse for the day), the court’s award inEddie Toonis not in my view conclusive\n                    authority that a homemaker’s full-time care should only be awarded a\n                    nominal value. Indeed, this point was never raised or discussed on\n                    appeal. 120    I have found the English case law on how to\n                    assess the cost of care gratuitously provided by family or friends instructive.\n                    English case law on this issue suggests that there are two broad approaches to\n                    assessing the cost of care gratuitously provided by family or friends. The first\n                    is the “loss of earnings basis”, and the second is the\n                    “cost of care basis”:Fairhurst v St Helens and\n                        Knowsley Health Authority[1995] PIQR Q1 (“Fairhurst”). 121    Both approaches seek to provide proper\n                    recompense for the services provided gratuitously by a family carer. As May LJ\n                    held inEvans v Pontypridd Roofing Limited[2002]\n                    P.I.Q.R. Q5 (“Evans v Pontypridd”)\n                    at [25]: … Circumstances vary enormously and what is appropriate and just in\n                        one case may not be so in another. If a caring relation has given up\n                        remunerative employment to care for the claimant gratuitously, it may well\n                        be appropriate to assess the services providedby\n                            reference to the carer’s lost earnings. If the carer\n                        has not given up gainful employment, the task remains to assess proper\n                        recompense for the services provided. As O’Connor LJ said inHousecroft v Burnett, regard may be had towhat it would cost to provide the services on the open\n                            market. But the services are not in fact being bought in the\n                        open market, so that adjustments will need to be made. [emphasis added] 122    Indeed, the principle that an objective of\n                    the assessment is to provide proper recompense to the caregiver comes fromHousecroft v Burnett[1986] 1 All ER 332\n                        (“Housecroft v Burnett”).\n                    O’Connor LJ held at 343: … Once it is understood that this is an element in the award to the\n                        plaintiff to provide for the reasonable and proper care of the plaintiff and\n                        that a capital sum is to be available for that purpose, the court should\n                        look at it as a whole and consider whether, on the facts of the case, it is\n                        sufficient to enable the plaintiff, among other things, to make reasonable\n                        recompense to the relative. So, in cases where the relative has given up\n                        gainful employment to look after the plaintiff, I would regard it as natural\n                        that the plaintiff would not wish the relative to be the loser and the court\n                        would award sufficient to enable the plaintiff to achieve that result. The\n                        ceiling would be the commercial rate. In cases like the present I would look\n                        at the award of £108,550, remembering that there is in that sum a sum\n                        of £39,000 over and above the sum required to provide the expected\n                        outgoings, and ask: is this sufficient to provide for the plaintiff's needs,\n                        including enabling her to make some monetary acknowledgment of her\n                        appreciation of all that her mother does for her? I would also ask: is it\n                        sufficient for this plaintiff should her mother fall by the wayside and be\n                        unable to give as she gives now? … 123    While the objective of providing reasonable\n                    recompense to the caregiver is clear and undisputed, it is noted that\n                    O’Connor LJ framed this objective within the overall goal of making\n                    sufficient provision for the plaintiff’s needs. For this reason, the\n                    question was also asked: “is it sufficient for this plaintiff should her\n                    mother fall by the wayside and be unable to give as she gives\n                    now”. 124    As mentioned above, English case law\n                    suggests two distinct approaches in assessing what is reasonable recompense. I\n                    shall call them the “income approach”, and the “cost of\n                    care approach”. 125    The founding authority for the income\n                    approach is arguably the case ofDonnelly v Joyce.\n                    In that case, Megaw LJ awarded the plaintiff the cost of his mother’s care\n                    based on the income she would have earned if she did not have to stay home to\n                    take care of the plaintiff. This was justified as the plaintiff’s loss (at\n                    462): … The loss is the plaintiff’s loss. The question from what\n                        source the plaintiff’s needs have been met, the question who has paid\n                        the money or given the services, the question whether or not the plaintiff\n                        is or is not under a legal or moral liability to repay, are, so far as the\n                        defendant and his liability are concerned, all irrelevant.The plaintiff’s loss, to take this present case, is not\n                            the expenditure of money to buy the special boots or to pay for the\n                            nursing attention. His loss is the existence of the need for those\n                            special boots or for those nursing services, the value of\n                        which for purposes of damages – for the purpose of the ascertainment\n                        of the amount of his loss – is the proper and reasonable cost of\n                        supplying those needs. [emphasis added] 126    Earlier at [88], I noted that the House of\n                    Lords inHunt v Seversdisagreed with the holding\n                    that the source the plaintiff’s needs were met was irrelevant. That said,\n                    the loss of income approach was not disagreed with and indeed was also adopted\n                    by the Court of Appeal inFitzgerald v Ford[1996]\n                    PIQR Q72 (“Fitzgerald v Ford”),\n                    where the court awarded the plaintiff £62,600 for her\n                    brother-in-law’s gratuitous caregiving. Her brother-in-law was her\n                    full-time caregiver and the sum of £62,600 represented his loss of\n                    earnings. Notably, there was evidence that after making the appropriate\n                    discounts, an award based on the cost of professional care (the alternative\n                    basis for assessment, as we will see in a while) would have come up to\n                    £82,000. However, the court chose to make an award for future care on the\n                    basis of the caregiver’s loss of income. 127    The second approach adopted by the English\n                    courts is the cost of care approach. As suggested in the passage quoted above\n                    fromEvans v Pontypridd, this method of assessment\n                    is based on what it would cost the plaintiff to obtain equivalent caregiving\n                    services on the open market. On this approach, the courts generally base their\n                    award on the hourly rate of professional nursing care, and multiply it by the\n                    number of hours of care required as a result of the accident. A quarter to\n                    one-third discount is then applied to the global figure to take into account the\n                    fact that the plaintiff is receiving the services gratuitously, and that income\n                    tax and National Insurance contributions (a feature unique to the English legal\n                    system) are not paid on the provision of the caregiving services: seeEvans v Pontypriddat [14] and [36]–[38];Fairhurst;Willbye v\n                        Gibbons[2004] PIQR P15. 128    In deciding that only a 25% rather than a\n                    one-third deduction should be made inFairhurst,\n                    the court took into account the fact that the parents inFairhursthad to acquire special skills to take care of the\n                    plaintiff. The parents’ services were thus valued “somewhat closer\n                    to the full commercial rate than might otherwise have been appropriate”.\n                    This reasoning was affirmed inEvans v Pontypriddat [37], and the court additionally stated that it would also take into account\n                    the possibility that “the services of the gratuitous carer may not be\n                    available for the entire period upon which the assessment is based” in\n                    determining the appropriate discount to apply. 129    Having laid out the two approaches adopted\n                    by English courts in different cases, the important, and perhaps trickier,\n                    question is how they interact. 130    First, O’Connor LJ inHousecroft v Burnettheld at 343 that while a\n                    plaintiff’s caregiver’s loss of income may be the basis for\n                    computing the award for past and future care, “[t]he ceiling would be the\n                    commercial rate” of the caregiving services provided. By contrast, where\n                    the caregiver’s loss of income is less than the discounted commercial rate\n                    of obtaining caregiving services, the courts have in some instances decided to\n                    award the plaintiff the lower figure: seeFitzgerald v\n                        Ford. 131    Second, based onEvans v\n                        Pontypriddat [25], it appears that the English courts have\n                    avoided “putting first instance judges into too restrictive a\n                    strait-jacket, such as might happen if it was said that the means of assessing a\n                    proper recompense for services provided gratuitously by a family carer had to be\n                    assessed in a particular way or ways”. The court then went on to describe\n                    the income approach and the cost of care approach as two possible methods of\n                    assessment (see quoted passage fromEvans v\n                        Pontypriddat [121] of this judgment). In other words, the\n                    English cases suggest that thereareandshould beno fixed rules governing which approach a\n                    court adopts. It all depends on what is appropriate and just on the particular\n                    facts. 132    Third, the authorities accept that where the\n                    caregiver did not in fact give up any gainful employment in entering into\n                    full-time care of the plaintiff, the cost of care approach should be used: seeHousecroft v Burnettat 343 andFairhurst. 133    On this basis, a plaintiff who receives\n                    gratuitous care from a caregiver who did not give up gainful employment would\n                    necessarily be awarded damages based on the cost of care approach. A plaintiff\n                    who receives gratuitous care from a caregiver who did give up gainful employment\n                    could, on the basis ofHousecroft v Burnett, be\n                    awarded damages based on either the income or cost of care approach. A problem,\n                    however, with the law as set out by O’Connor LJ inHousecroft v Burnettis that the damages awarded on the cost of\n                    care approach is necessarily higher than the damages awarded on the income\n                    approach. This is because the ceiling for an award on the income approach is the\n                    commercial rate of caregiving. Given the cost of care approach is premised on\n                    the commercial rate of caregiving, the income approach would, at best, give a\n                    plaintiff an award as high as one assessed on a cost of care approach. Indeed,\n                    if we consider the facts ofFitzgerald v Ford, the\n                    plaintiff would arguably have received a higher award for future care if her\n                    brother-in-law (her primary caregiver) were unemployed before. She might have\n                    been awarded the discounted cost of commercial care (£82,000) rather than\n                    her brother-in-law’s loss of income (£62,600). 134    The learned author of Harvey McGregor, QC,McGregor on Damages(Sweet & Maxwell,\n                        19thEd, 2014) (“McGregor on Damages”) considered this problem and argues\n                    at para 38-231: … if the relative has given up employment which paid him or her\n                        less than what the court would award to a relative who had not given up paid\n                        employment and was therefore entitled to the cost of commercial care as\n                        discounted, the same award should be made to both. This seems only right,\n                        though it is contrary to Stuart-Smith L.J.’s approach inFitzgerald v Ford. … 135    He further argues inMcGregor on Damagesat para 38-232 that the statement that the\n                    “ceiling would be the commercial rate” inHousecroft v Burnettwas strictlydictaand is not binding. A plaintiff should be allowed to\n                    recover the cost of a devoted family carer even if it is more expensive (when\n                    assessed based on loss of income) than outside professionals. 136    A final point I would make is that there are\n                    precedents where English courts have awarded a plaintiff damages on the basis of\n                    the cost of care approach even if computing damages on the basis of the income\n                    approach would have resulted in a smaller award (ie, the opposite ofFitzgerald v\n                        Ford). This can be seen in the Court of Appeal decision inHogg v Doyle, CA, Judgment of 6 March 1991\n                    (Unreported), where the plaintiff was awarded damages based on the cost of care\n                    approach, which amounted in substance to 1.5 times the plaintiff’s\n                    caregiver’s loss of earnings. This was justified on the basis of the\n                    extensive care provided by the caregiver. 137    The discussion above has perhaps raised more\n                    difficulties than answers. Does the cost of care approach have any place in\n                    Singapore law? If so, how should the relationship between the income approach\n                    and the cost of care approach operate in practice? 138    The income approach and the cost of care\n                    approach are premised on divergent conceptual paradigms. The income approach\n                    views the cost of care which the plaintiff receives as that which had to be\n                    foregone by the caregiver. By contrast, the cost of care approach views the cost\n                    of care the plaintiff receives to be the fair value of the nursing and\n                    caregiving servicesactually providedby the\n                    caregiver, regardless of what the caregiver could have otherwise earned. That\n                    said, I repeat the observation of O’Connor LJ inHousecroft v Burnettthat the question is whether the sum\n                    awarded is “sufficient to provide for the plaintiff’s\n                    needs”. In that case, the needs include enabling the plaintiff to make\n                    some monetary acknowledgment of his or her appreciation of all that her mother\n                    (the caregiver) does for her, as well as making sufficient provision for the\n                    plaintiff if her mother should “fall by the wayside”. The needs\n                    are those of theplaintiff. The loss in question\n                    is also theplaintiff’s. 139    Coming back to the case authorities in\n                    Singapore, the Court of Appeal established inLee Wei Kong\n                        (CA)that in assessing the value of the gratuitous\n                    caregiver’s care, the caregiver’s loss of income should be the\n                    starting point. I am bound by this authority. 140    Indeed, there is merit in adopting the\n                    income approach where the caregiver has given up employment. After all, from a\n                    practical point of view, the value of the loss caused by the accident (in terms\n                    of nursing or care needs) is indeed the loss of the income which the caregiver\n                    would otherwise have earned. This is the plaintiff’s loss, because the\n                    accident created the need for him to be cared for by family. The argument made\n                    by the learner author ofMcGregor on Damagesat\n                    para 38-232 also supports this view: the cost of care a devoted husband provides\n                    must be measured in terms of what he had to give up (a well-paying job) and not\n                    just in terms of the actual commercial value of the nursing care he provides\n                    (which may arguably be unquantifiable in the open market because from his\n                    wife’s perspective, he is not substitutable by any other nurse or\n                    caregiver). 141    The question that remains to be answered is\n                    whether a similar approach should be applied to homemakers. Should only a\n                    nominal value be awarded for the cost of their care on the basis that they did\n                    not give up gainful employment? In my view, this must be wrong. Taking guidance\n                    from the cost of care approach, the correct approach in such cases is to\n                    consider the value of the care a caregiveractually\n                        providesto a plaintiff (as derived from commercial rates with a\n                    suitable discount applied where appropriate) . Even in the case of caregivers\n                    who were earning nothing before (or an income lower than the cost of care), the\n                    loss caused to a plaintiff must still be, at the minimum, the value of the care\n                    that he requires as a result of the accident. To say that the value of the care\n                    provided by a homemaker is merely nominal would not only unfairly devalue the\n                    non-financial contributions of homemakers in our society, but would also devalue\n                    the significant sacrifice the homemaker has to make as a result of the\n                    accident. 142    Thus, to summarise my conclusions at this\n                    juncture, I find that in assessing the cost of gratuitous care received by a\n                    plaintiff, the following approach is to be adopted: (a)     The caregiver’s foregone\n                        income is to be the starting point. (b)     This starting point may be departed from where\n                        appropriate if the foregone income isless\n                            thanthe fair value of the nursing and caring services\n                        provided to the plaintiff. In such a case, the cost of the gratuitous care\n                        received by a plaintiff shall be taken to be the fair value of the nursing\n                        and caring services the plaintiff actually requires and\n                    receives. 143    It is appropriate at this point to address a\n                    concern raised earlier that it would be unfair to a defendant to require him to\n                    compensate a plaintiff for the cost of a family carer if that family carer\n                    happens to be earning a large salary. In my view, this concern should come in\n                    only at the second stage of the inquiry, after the cost of a gratuitous\n                    caregiver’s care has been assessed. 144    Where it is clear on the facts that the\n                    plaintiff has been and will continue to be cared for gratuitously by a family\n                    carer, the first stage of the inquiry requires anassessment\n                        of the value of the care provided gratuitouslyby the said\n                    caregiver and received by the plaintiff. For this, the principles stated above\n                    apply. Should the caregiver’s pre-accident income be $50,000, the value or\n                    cost of the care gratuitously provided by that caregiver would ordinarily be\n                    assessed at $50,000 per month. 145    This is where the second stage comes in. As\n                    seen fromEddie Toonand thedictain [11] ofLee Wei Kong\n                    (HC), the plaintiff must also show that it isreasonable for him to receive the particular mode of care he seeks\n                        compensation for. The reasonableness inquiry will involve a\n                    balancing of the plaintiff’s need for the specific mode of care, the\n                    equivalence of the other available alternatives, and the costs of the various\n                    modes of care. InEddie Toon, where the court\n                    found that institutional nursing care (with the plaintiff’s mother\n                    travelling daily to visit him) or the assistance of a domestic maid was\n                    sufficient to meet the needs of the plaintiff, hiring a private nurse to stay at\n                    his home throughout the day was found to be unreasonable. Similarly, if a family\n                    caregiver was earning $50,000 per month (and hence the costs of the family\n                    carer’s care would be assessed at $50,000 per month as per the principles\n                    laid down above), and the costs of professional nursing care (which may offer\n                    the plaintiff superior care from a medical perspective) were substantially less,\n                    the court may not find it reasonable that the plaintiff chooses to have his high\n                    earning family carer stay at home to take care of him. On that basis, the court\n                    may only award damages for future nursing care on the basis of the lower rate of\n                    hired help. If the high-wage earning parent still chooses to stay at home and\n                    provide the care and forgo the $50,000 salary - that is a choice for the parent\n                    to make. 146    Indeed, I make the observation that the loss\n                    of income approach set out by the Court of Appeal inLee Wei\n                        Kong (CA)at [63] is couched in terms of it being “the\n                    starting point”. In appropriate cases, it must follow that adjustments\n                    can be made: whether up or down from that starting point depending on the\n                    overall facts and circumstances. Whilst it may be questioned whether\n                    O’Connor LJ’s ceiling of the “commercial rate” is\n                    rightly cast as a mandatory rule, there is no reason why it should not be a\n                    factor, as a matter of fairness and reasonableness, which can be taken into\n                    account in appropriate cases in assessing the plaintiff’s needs for\n                    nursing and home care during his remaining life expectancy. 147    In my view, adopting the above approach to\n                    determining the award that should be made for the past and future care of the\n                    plaintiff (whether such care be provided gratuitously by a family carer, by a\n                    domestic maid, by an institutional nursing home, or by a private stay-in nurse)\n                    allows the court to fairly balance the interest of both parties. 148    Applying the above to the present case, it\n                    is clear that the Plaintiff’s mother will continue caring for him\n                    gratuitously. The first stage of the inquiry is therefore triggered – what\n                    is the value which should be ascribed to her caregiving? Her loss of income is\n                    the starting point. As seen above, I have affirmed the AR’s decision that\n                    the Plaintiff’s mother has foregone $1,508 per month in salary. The only\n                    question that remains is whether this falls below the fair value of the nursing\n                    and caring services the Plaintiff’s motheractually\n                        provides. 149    In the present case, little evidence was\n                    provided on that. Based on the parties’ submissions, I do not have enough\n                    to determine if the Plaintiff’s mother provides care akin to a private\n                    nurse, or whether a second domestic helper could fulfil her role. As such, the\n                    sum of $1,508 per month should be taken as the value of the Plaintiff’s\n                    mother’s caregiving. 150    I move on to the second stage of the\n                    inquiry. Again, the parties did not make submissions on whether it was\n                    reasonable to award $1,508 per month as the Plaintiff’s cost of care given\n                    the range of alternatives available. The Defendant’s only submission on\n                    appeal is that the Plaintiff’s mother would have likely quit her job. I\n                    have already rejected this submission. Based on the material before me,\n                    therefore, I find that $1,508 per month is a reasonable sum to award the\n                    Plaintiff for the costs of one of his caregivers (ie, his mother).",

For the avoidance of doubt, the Defendant’s appeal against the\n                    costs ordered by the AR is dismissed. Cost of the present appeal is to be\n                    awarded to the Plaintiff to be agreed or taxed. 313    The hearing on damages in this case has\n                    taken considerable time.

The court\n                    also records its gratitude to the medical experts who have testified and, in\n                    particular to Dr Henry Tan and Dr Annette Ang, for the assistance they have\n                    provided.

        "Future transport expenses": "152    Future transport expenses relate to the cost\n                    of private ambulance trips needed to transport the Plaintiff to the hospital for\n                    follow-ups. In awarding the Plaintiff $23,520 for future transport expenses, the\n                    AR took into account the following factors: (a)     Award should only relate to\n                        non-emergency cases because the cost of the ambulance is included in the\n                        hospitalisation bill in emergency cases. (b)     The Plaintiff is likely to take an average of\n                        28 non-emergency trips to the hospital annually: physiotherapy sessions\n                        twice a month (12 x 2 = 24), and medical consultations four times a\n                        year. (c)     The\n                        average cost of private ambulance services is $70 given the invoices for the\n                        ambulance fees show that the costs ranged from $50 to\n                $90. 153    The Plaintiff makes two points on\n                    appeal: (a)     First, the Plaintiff submits that\n                        the AR was wrong to leave out an award for the cost of ambulance services in\n                        emergency cases. According to the Plaintiff’s counsel, historical data\n                        shows that the cost of private ambulance services for emergency cases is not\n                        included in the Plaintiff’s hospitalisation bills. (b)     Second, the Plaintiff submits that\n                        the AR was wrong about the average costs of ambulance services. Apparently,\n                        the cost of a one-way transfer is $50 to $90. The average cost of a two-way\n                        transfer is $110. Naturally, the Plaintiff submits that he should be awarded\n                        the cost of a two-way transfer.",
        "Frequency of trips": "154    On the first point, the Plaintiff submits\n                    that the appropriate number of two-way ambulance trips he should be compensated\n                    for is673. I cite the following table from the\n                    Plaintiff’s closing submissions to explain his claim: Types of treatmentNumber of trips1Medical\n                                        consultation4 per year x 16-year\n                                            multiplier = 642URTI7 per year x 16-year\n                                            multiplier = 1123Non-intensive rehabilitation\n                                            and physiotherapy2 per month x 12 months x\n                                            16-year multiplier = 3844Intensive rehabilitation and\n                                            physiotherapy11 x 4.5 months x 2 tenotomy\n                                            treatments = 995Pneumonia10 trips in his\n                                            lifetime6Tenotomy / Botox and Baclofen\n                                            infusion treatment4 treatmentsTotal673   155    The AR has already included the trips for\n                    the first and third items in the table (ie,\n                    medical consultation and non-intensive rehabilitation and physiotherapy) in her\n                    calculations of the total number of trips needed in a year. There is no appeal\n                    relating to that decision. On the fourth item,ie,\n                    rehabilitation and physiotherapy during the intensified period after the two\n                    tenotomy procedures, I have decided above that the AR’s global award for\n                    two rehabilitation and physiotherapy sessions a month for the rest of the\n                    Plaintiff’s life is appropriate. I have explained that the award of two\n                    physiotherapy sessions a month seems to more than adequately cater for even the\n                    intensified period after the tenotomy procedures. It thus follows that the\n                    Plaintiff’s claim for transport costs to his post-tenotomy rehabilitation\n                    sessions is adequately covered by the third item in the above table and the\n                    claim for the fourth item in the table above must fail. 156    According to the Plaintiff, the remaining\n                    three items claimed in the table above relate to emergency cases. The question\n                    therefore is whether the hospitalisation bills for URTI treatment, pneumonia\n                    treatment, tenotomy procedures, and botox and baclofen infusion treatment,\n                    include the cost of a two-way ambulance transfer. If it does, allowing the\n                    Plaintiff to claim for private ambulance costs here would effectively allow\n                    double recovery because these costs would have already been taken into account\n                    in calculating the appropriate award for the above treatments and procedures.\n                    However, if the hospitalisation bill does not cover transport costs, then the\n                    Plaintiff should rightfully be entitled to claim the cost of a two-way ambulance\n                    transfer each time his injuries necessitate a trip to the\n                hospital. 157    Before me, the Defendant’s counsel\n                    conceded that the hospitalisation bill for the Plaintiff’s visit to the\n                    hospital on 14 July 2012 did not include ambulance costs. He did not seek to\n                    challenge the sufficiency of the evidence the Plaintiff adduced, and I hence\n                    proceed on the basis that an award should be made for emergency ambulance\n                    trips. 158    Looking at the above table, the appropriate\n                    award for item 5 should be seven trips rather than 10 trips (see my conclusion\n                    above at [61]–[69]). In relation to item 2, the Plaintiff’s\n                    submission of seven trips per year for URTI treatment does not appear to be\n                    disputed (see [44] above). The claim for four treatments for tenotomy and botox\n                    and baclofen infusion treatments seems reasonable as well given the AR’s\n                    conclusion that the Plaintiff would require two tenotomy procedures (see the\n                    AR’s Judgment at [64]) and two botox and baclofen infusion treatments (see\n                    the AR’s Judgment at [66]) for the rest of his life. 159    Thus, to sum up, the following table\n                    represents the number of ambulance trips I am awarding, on the basis of a\n                    14-year multiplier: Types of treatmentNumber of trips1Medical\n                                        consultation4 per year x 14-year\n                                            multiplier = 562URTI7 per year x 14-year\n                                            multiplier = 983Non-intensive rehabilitation\n                                            and physiotherapy2 per month x 12 months x\n                                            14-year multiplier = 3364Intensive rehabilitation and\n                                            physiotherapynil5Pneumonia7 trips in his\n                                            lifetime6Tenotomy / Botox and Baclofen\n                                            infusion treatment4 treatmentsTotal501",
        "Average cost of a two-way ambulance transfer": "160    The next question is simple: what is the\n                    average cost of a two-way ambulance transfer? I am satisfied that based on the\n                    invoices, the AR mistakenly assumed that $50 to $90 was the cost of atwo-wayambulance transfer. At the oral hearing before\n                    me on 7 September 2015, the Defendant’s counsel conceded that $100 was a\n                    good estimate of the average two-way ambulance costs. He recognised that costs\n                    may be higher depending on whether the ambulance trip is taken during or outside\n                    office hours. As such, I find that $100 is a good estimate of the average costs\n                    of a two-way ambulance transfer.",
        "Future expenses for daily consumables and essentials": "163    At [98]–[99] of the AR’s\n                    Judgment, the AR awarded $325 per month for daily consumables and essentials\n                    (such as nasogastric tubes, suction tubes, diapers, liquid diet, daily dressings\n                    and wipes). It is undisputed that this sum was derived after deducting the\n                    subsidies the Plaintiff received from the KK Women’s and Children’s\n                    Hospital (“KKH”) Health Endowment Fund and the Medifund Junior\n                    Scheme (see [98]–[99] of the AR’s Judgment). 164    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that the AR\n                    should not have taken into account the subsidies the Plaintiff received. At the\n                    court’s request, the Plaintiff tendered a letter dated 29 April 2015 from\n                    the Medical Social Work Department of KKH which stated that the Plaintiff will\n                    not qualify for financial assistance once he receives the damages awarded for\n                    his injuries. As such, the Plaintiff submits that $1,000 per month for daily\n                    consumables and essentials is a more appropriate multiplicand.[note: 2]In light of the new evidence,\n                    the Defendant has since accepted that the Plaintiff’s figure of $1,000 per\n                    month is reasonable.[note: 3] 165    As such, I allow the Plaintiff’s\n                    appeal on this issue, and award the Plaintiff $168,000 for future daily\n                    consumables and essentials. I derive this figure as follows: $1,000 per month x 12 months x 14-year multiplier =$168,000",
        "Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings": "166    As a result of the Defendant’s\n                    negligence, the Plaintiff has no hope of ever earning a wage or supporting\n                    himself. Moreover, medical experts estimate that the number of years he has left\n                    to live has been shortened considerably (he is expected to live only up to an\n                    age of 38). It is thus not at all inaccurate to say that the Defendant’s\n                    actions have caused the Plaintiff to lose all the working years he would have\n                    had as a normal, healthy adult if the accident did not take place. 167    The question before the court, however, is\n                    whether compensation should be given for the Plaintiff’sloss of earningsacross all the years of life he no\n                    longer has, but would have had, if he did not meet with the accident (the\n                    multiplier question). Moreover, a second question that arises is how much the\n                    Plaintiff would have earned (in terms of a monthly wage) across his years of\n                    working life (the multiplicand question). The difficulty in estimating the\n                    second is obvious in the present case – this nine year-old boy could very\n                    well have become a wealthy businessman or professional, as much as he could have\n                    ended up in a low-waged blue collar job. The only thing that is clear is that\n                    after the accident, neither of these are possibilities. 168    At the hearing below, the AR adopted a\n                    multiplier of nine years in relation to the Plaintiff’s loss of future\n                    earnings. She assumed that the Plaintiff would only start work after finishing\n                    National Service at 22 years old. Neither party objected to that assumption. She\n                    then reasoned that given the Plaintiff is expected to live up to 38 years old,\n                    he is likely to have 16 years of working life. She rejected the\n                    Plaintiff’s submission that a multiplier of 16 years should be adopted,\n                    stating that the multiplier must be discounted for the vicissitudes of life and\n                    the accelerated receipt of a lump sum award which can be invested to yield a\n                    return (see [33] of the AR’s Judgment). On the basis ofEddie Toon, where the court adopted a nine-year multiplier for a\n                    plaintiff who was 7.5 years old at the time of the accident and was likely to\n                    have 19 years of working life in view of his reduced life expectancy, the AR\n                    adopted a multiplier of nine years. 169    On appeal, the Plaintiff submits that a\n                    multiplier of 20 years (or 16 years in the alternative) should be awarded. The\n                    Plaintiff makes this submission on the basis of a new argument that was never\n                    raised before the AR. The argument is that the Plaintiff should be awarded loss\n                    of future earnings up until the normal retirement age of 62 years old,iefor 40 years of working life, since this is the\n                    period he would likely have worked and earned a salary if the accident had not\n                    taken place. In other words, the Plaintiff submits that he should also be\n                    awarded damages for his loss of future earnings during the years he has lost due\n                    to the accident. I shall refer to this as the “lost years\n                    claim”. 170    At the first hearing before me, the matter\n                    was adjourned and I asked parties to make further written submissions on the\n                    differences between a lost years claim by a living plaintiff, a deceased\n                    plaintiff’s estate, and a dependency claim. The parties duly tendered the\n                    written submissions, and I must express my gratitude for the detailed and\n                    well-researched arguments presented. Indeed, having read the submissions, it is\n                    apparent that the legislative and historical context in which a lost years claim\n                    is made is of some significance. It is to that which I first turn.",
        "Legislative and historical context of a lost years claim": "171    Where a plaintiff’s life is truncated\n                    because of a defendant’s negligence, the lost years can never be fully\n                    made good by a monetary award. Indeed, even in the case of the loss of\n                    opportunity to earn a wage and to generate an income in the years that have been\n                    taken away, considerable problems have arisen in determining the extent to which\n                    such “losses” can be compensated. 172    I pause here to note two different factual\n                    scenarios whereby a claim for loss of earnings in respect of the years lost\n                    might arise. First, there is the case where the tortfeasor has killed the\n                    victim. The second is where the tortfeasor has injured the victim such that his\n                    or her normal life expectancy has been reduced. In both cases, difficult\n                    questions of law and policy arise where a claim is brought in respect of loss of\n                    expectation of life and loss of earnings or earning capacity in respect of the\n                    years lost. 173    The problem is perhaps at its most acute in\n                    the first scenario. The common law rule was that no action could be brought for\n                    loss suffered through the killing of another. This position was eventually\n                    changed by Parliament. In Singapore, it is now dealt with by various provisions\n                    in the Civil Law Act (Cap 43, 1999 Rev Ed) (“Civil Law Act”). That\n                    said, even in the second scenario, the question as to whether it is proper for\n                    the victim to maintain a claim for loss of earnings in respect of the years lost\n                    (as opposed to any loss of earnings or earning capacity in the years of life\n                    that remain) has caused problems. 174    A number of philosophical questions arise.\n                    First, it may be asked, as did Lord Scarman inPickett\n                        (Administratix of the Estate of Ralph Henry Pickett Deceased) v British Rail\n                        Engineering Ltd[1978] 3 WLR 955 (“Pickett v British Rail”) at 980H: what does compensation\n                    mean when it is assessed in respect of a period after death? 175    As Lord Scarman candidly responds (at 981E),\n                    there is no completely satisfying answer. While it can be said that a plaintiff\n                    who loses the ability to earn a living because of an accident suffers a loss of\n                    earnings in the period that helives\n                    incapacitated, it is not as easy to say the same for a plaintiff who\n                    has lost the chance at living itself. The loss of earnings during those lost\n                    years arguably belongs to his “future self” who will no longer be\n                    around to earn and enjoy them because of the accident. That said, Lord\n                    Scarman’s comment at 981F also bears repeating: … The logical and philosophical difficulties of compensating a man\n                        for a loss arising after his death emerge only if one treats the loss as a\n                        non-pecuniary loss – which to some extent it is.But it is also a pecuniary loss– the money would have\n                        been his to deal with as he chose, had he lived… [emphasis added] 176    Second, another question is asked: who is or\n                    are the parties that have suffered loss and who ought to be compensated? We\n                    might assume that the answer is clear and straightforward – it is the\n                    plaintiff who has suffered loss. However, as will be seen, the law as it has\n                    developed is very much concerned about compensating the loss caused todependantsas well. The line between the two is blurred\n                    at times. 177    Third, assuming the loss of earnings during\n                    the lost years is properly seen as the plaintiff’s own loss, yet another\n                    question arises: how does the law conceptualise what the plaintiff has lost?\n                    This is related to the first question. Is the object of the monetary award to\n                    compensate the plaintiff for his loss of a chance at enjoying his earnings? But,\n                    that is something no monetary award can ever remedy. It is an irremediable fact\n                    that the years of potential enjoyment are lost. Further, to earn that income and\n                    to enjoy the income, expenses will have to be incurred. Indeed, the\n                    “right” to spend money on oneself is a self-evident common way of\n                    enjoying the fruits of labour. 178    Perhaps, as suggested by Lord Wilberforce inPickett v British Rail(at 962A), the loss\n                    suffered by the plaintiff is the loss of the financial ability to use such part\n                    of the income that he does not need for his dependants, or for other persons or\n                    causes which he wishes to support. Or perhaps, as suggested by Lord Scarman in\n                    the passage I quoted above, there is no need to further conceptualise the loss.\n                    The loss is a straightforward pecuniary loss – money which would have been\n                    his, but is no longer his, because of the accident. 179    Compelled by the myriad of different factual\n                    circumstances, three distinct types of claims have developed in English and\n                    Singapore law. 180    First, aliving\n                        plaintiff’s claimfor loss of income during the lost years.\n                    This is the claim in the present case. The plaintiff’s life expectancy and\n                    hence his working years are reduced, but the plaintiff is alive at the time of\n                    trial. I shall call this a “Living Plaintiff’s\n                    Claim”. 181    Second, anestate\n                        claimfor a deceased plaintiff’s loss of income during the\n                    lost years. This relates to a situation where the plaintiff has died as a result\n                    of the accident at the time of the trial, but the estate\n                    “inherits” his claim for lost years and pursues the action for the\n                    damages the plaintiff would have been entitled to had he been alive to\n                    personally pursue the action. I shall call this an “Estate Claim”.\n                    In Singapore, the enabling statutory provision can be found at s 10 of the Civil\n                    Law Act. 182    Third, aclaim by the\n                        dependantsfor the loss they suffered as a result of the\n                    deceased’s loss of income during the lost years. This relates to a\n                    situation where the plaintiff has died as a result of the accident at the time\n                    of the trial, and his or her dependants make a claim for the loss they suffered\n                    as a result of the deceased’s loss of earnings due to his death. I shall\n                    call this a “Dependant’s Claim”. In Singapore, the enabling\n                    statutory provision can be found at s 20 of the Civil Law Act. 183    These claims all arise from the tortfeasor\n                    having caused a plaintiff’s death or reduced life expectancy, which\n                    results in a loss of earnings during the lost years. A brief review of the\n                    historical development of these claims may be helpful. 184    InLassiter Ann Masters\n                        (suing as the widow and dependant of Lassiter Henry Adolphus, deceased) v To\n                        Keng Lam (alias Toh Jeanette)[2005] 2 SLR(R) 8\n                        (“Lassiter”) at [12]–[29],\n                    Woo Bih Li J explained the legislative history behind the development of these\n                    claims in great detail. Reference may therefore be made toLassiterfor a more detailed exposition of the historical\n                    development of these claims. I mention only the salient points\n                here. 185    Singapore’s law on fatal accidents and\n                    claims for loss of income has followed English law quite closely:Lassiterat [12]. English law, as noted above, started\n                    out by disallowing all claims when a plaintiff passes on. This was based on the\n                    common law principle that a personal action dies with the person. However,\n                    because of the injustice that dependants were thought to suffer from losing\n                    their sole breadwinner in an accident caused by a defendant’s negligence,\n                    the United Kingdom (“UK”) passed the Fatal Accidents Act 1846\n                    (UK). This Act enabled prescribed classes of dependants to bring an action for\n                    loss of dependency against a tortfeasor who caused the death of their relatives.\n                    This legislative provision is presently in force in the UK under s 1 of the\n                    English Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (UK). It is also in force in Singapore under s\n                    20 of the Civil Law Act. It should be noted that such a claim cannot be brought\n                    if the plaintiff had obtained judgment against the defendant for the\n                    “wrongful act, neglect or default” before he died. 186    There was a second development in English,\n                    and subsequently, Singapore law, which culminated in what I referred to above as\n                    the Estate Claim. The English Parliament passed the Law Reform (Miscellaneous\n                    Provisions) Act 1934 (UK), which provided at s 1 that “on the death of\n                    any person after the commencement of this Act all causes of action subsisting\n                    against or vested in him shall survive against, or, as the case may be, for the\n                    benefit of, his estate”. 187    In line with this amendment, Singapore\n                    adopted s 8 of the Civil Law Act (Cap 30, 1970 Ed) (“the 1970 Civil Law\n                    Act”). The English and Singapore provisions werein\n                        pari materia. The provisions allowed a deceased plaintiff’s\n                    estate to inherit and pursue,inter alia, his lost\n                    years claim even after his death. 188    In England, the above legislative provisions\n                    were applied inGammell v Wilson[1981] 2 WLR 248\n                        (“Gammell v Wilson”). In that\n                    case, the House of Lords upheld an Estate Claim for two young plaintiffs who\n                    died as a result of the defendant’s negligence. Similarly, in Singapore,\n                    the Singapore Court of Appeal inLow Kok Tong v Teo Chan\n                        Pan[1981–1982] SLR(R) 643 (“Low\n                        Kok Tong”) followed the House of Lords inGammell v Wilson, and allowed an Estate\n                Claim. 189    While an Estate Claim was thus recognised by\n                    the highest courts of both jurisdictions, I note that both courts came to the\n                    decision with significant reluctance and regret. In particular, the courts were\n                    concerned with the potential unfairness to a defendant arising from the\n                    possibility of double recovery by the estate and by the dependants under statute\n                        (ie, the possibility that an Estate Claim and\n                    a Dependant’s Claim can both succeed simultaneously, resulting in the\n                    defendant having to pay damages twice for the same loss caused). 190    The English Parliament intervened afterGammell v Wilsonby passing the Administration\n                    of Justice Act 1982 (UK). The 1982 Act amended the Law Reform (Miscellaneous\n                    Provisions) Act 1934 (UK) by adding that an estatedoes\n                        notinherit actions for “damages for loss of income in\n                    respect of any period after that person’s death”. This essentially\n                    precluded an estate from bringing a lost years claim after the plaintiff’s\n                    death. Singapore followed suit in 1987, and the same amendment (in pari materia) can be found at s 10(3)(a)(ii) of the Civil Law Act. 191    Notably, from the Singapore Parliamentary\n                    Debates, Official Report (4 March 1987) vol 49 at cols 66–69, it can be\n                    seen that Parliament was concerned with solving the following problems in\n                    passing the 1987 amendment: (a)     the problem of double compensation\n                        as described above; and (b)     the problem of unjustly enriching distant relatives who\n                        are beneficiaries of the estate but are not dependants. 192    In my view, this legislative history\n                    strongly suggests thatwhere a plaintiff has already passed\n                        on, Parliament has been primarily concerned with compensating theloss to the dependants. The choice to remove\n                    an Estate Claim and retain a Dependant’s Claim demonstrates that. The law\n                    is not concerned with compensating a deceased plaintiff’spersonalloss of earnings in the lost years (which\n                    should ordinarily belong to the estate like any other claim); it is instead\n                    concerned with compensating the dependants for their loss of support. It must be\n                    borne in mind that the deceased’s dependants are not necessarily the same\n                    persons entitled to his estate. The question that remains is whether this policy\n                    inclination applies, or ought to apply, in respect of aliving plaintiffwho has lost years based on medical estimates\n                    of reduced life expectancy. 193    It might have been observed that the above\n                    discussion of legislative history primarily concerns claims where the plaintiff\n                    hasalready passed on. Little has been said about\n                    a Living Plaintiff’s Claim, which is what the present case is concerned\n                    with. Nevertheless, the above discussion provides a helpful backdrop for the\n                    discussion that is to follow. I therefore now turn to discussing whether a\n                    living plaintiff can make a lost years claim.",
        "Lost years claim for a living plaintiff": "194    Philosophically controversial as it may be,\n                    it has become relatively uncontroversial in law that a living plaintiff does\n                    have a lost years claim. This general proposition may well be subject to certain\n                    exceptions, but it is certainly true as a starting point. Indeed, if this were\n                    not the case, the problem inGammell v Wilsonas\n                    well asLow Kok Tongwould never have arisen. The\n                    estate would not haveinheriteda claim for lost\n                    years if the deceased plaintiff never had such a claim when he was alive. I\n                    shall now consider the local and English authorities which support a Living\n                    Plaintiff’s Claim. Singapore position 195    As a preliminary, I note the\n                    Defendant’s submission that to the best of his knowledge, there are no\n                    local decisions on a Living Plaintiff’s Claim.[note: 4]This is not entirely accurate, as will be seen\n                    from the discussion that follows. 196    InLow Kok\n                        Tong, the deceased plaintiff was a 20 year-old national\n                    serviceman who died from the injuries he sustained in a traffic accident. The\n                    administrators of his estate made a claim for loss of future earnings under s 8\n                    of the 1970 Civil Law Act (which was then in force). The Singapore Court of\n                    Appeal allowed the Estate Claim (see [13] of the judgment). It citedPickett v British RailandGammell v\n                        Wilsonas authority for the following propositions: (a)     A person is entitled to be\n                        compensated not only for the immediate reduction in his earnings but also\n                        for the loss of the whole period for which he has been deprived of his\n                        ability to earn them:Low Kok Tongat\n                        [7]. (b)     A\n                        deceased’s estate is entitled to bring a claim for lost years under s\n                        8 of the 1970 Civil Law Act because the lost years claim vested in the\n                        deceased before he died:Low Kok Tongat\n                        [9]–[10]. 197    While this decision has effectively been\n                    overturned by the 1987 legislative amendment previously discussed,onlythe second proposition at [196(b)] above was\n                    rejected by Parliament – a deceased’s estate no longer can pursue a\n                    lost years claim. Importantly, the legislative amendments have no impact on\n                    whether aliving plaintiffstill has such a claim.Low Kok Tongtherefore is still good authority\n                    for the proposition at [196(a))] above, that a living plaintiff can make a lost\n                    years claim. 198    This position has been taken in two\n                    subsequent High Court cases as well. The first case isAu\n                        Yeong Wing Loong v Chew Hai Ban and another[1993] 2 SLR(R) 290\n                        (“Au Yeong Wing Loong”). That\n                    case concerned a plaintiff who sustained injuries in a road accident. He was\n                    severely disabled because of the accident and his life expectancy was reduced by\n                    10 to 15 years, but he lived to bring a claim for personal injury. The High\n                    Court awarded the plaintiff future loss of earnings for the period in which his\n                    working life was shortened. The award was made by basing the multiplier for loss\n                    of future earnings “on the working life of the plaintiff prior to his\n                    injuries”:Au Yeong Wing Loongat [59]. A\n                    Living Plaintiff Claim was thus allowed. 199    The second case isRamesh\n                        s/o Ayakanno (suing by the committee of the person and the estate, Ramiah\n                        Naragatha Vally) v Chua Gim Hock[2008] SGHC 33\n                        (“Ramesh v Chua”). The High\n                    Court (at [36]) affirmed the assistant registrar’s observation that an\n                    award for loss of future earnings was to compensate the plaintiff for losses he\n                    would not have incurred but for the accident. The plaintiff’s lifespan\n                    would not have been reduced if not for the accident. An appropriate multiplier\n                    must therefore be assessed with reference to the plaintiff’snatural or pre-accident working life. 200    I must point out that a potentially contrary\n                    authority exists and was brought to my attention by the parties. That is the\n                    case ofEddie Toon. InEddie\n                        Toon, the High Court adopted a multiplier of 9 years for the\n                    plaintiff’s loss of future earnings, taking into account the fact that the\n                    then seven and a half years old plaintiff’s post-accident working life\n                    would be 19 years: seeEddie Toonat\n                    [53]–[56]. The plaintiff was only expected to live up to an age of 40\n                    after the accident, and he was assumed to start work at 21 years old. The High\n                    Court did not make an award for loss of earnings during the plaintiff’s\n                    lost years. This question was never discussed. It appears that neither side\n                    brought the issue of lost years up, nor did the court consider the matter. I\n                    therefore do not think thatEddie Toonstands as\n                    an authorityagainstthe granting of a lost years\n                    claim. The claim was not granted simply because the plaintiff never put it into\n                    issue. 201    In conclusion, the Singapore authorities\n                    quite unanimously support the existence of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim.\n                    Whether there are exceptions to this general position is a matter that shall be\n                    subsequently discussed. I now consider the English authorities on the\n                    matter. English position 202    The most important English decision on a\n                    lost years claim is arguably the House of Lords decision inPickett v British Rail. In that case, the court held that a\n                    living plaintiff does have a lost years claim. The plaintiff was 51 years old\n                    when he contracted mesothelioma. This was caused by breathing in asbestos dust\n                    at work. The plaintiff successfully sued his employer for negligence and claimed\n                    damages for personal injuries. At the time of the trial, the plaintiff was\n                    expected to have only a year left to live. He had passed on by the time the case\n                    reached the House of Lords on appeal. The court found that if not for the\n                    asbestos dust that he had breathed in at work, the plaintiff would have been\n                    expected to live up to 65 years old. The court therefore held that the plaintiff\n                    was entitled to recover damages for loss of earnings during the lost years, but\n                    that the damages should be computed after deduction of his probable living\n                    expenses (see 963E, 966E, 974H and 981H–982A). I will not discuss the\n                    issue of assessing the multiplicand at this juncture. Instead, what is of\n                    importance at this stage is the majority’s reasons for allowing a lost\n                    years claim. 203    The first key plank of the majority’s\n                    reasoning is that the loss of earnings during the lost years was a real\n                    pecuniary loss to the plaintiff personally. As Lord Edmund-Davies puts it (at\n                    973H–974A): … With respect, it appears to me simply not right to say that, when\n                        a man’s working life and his natural life are each shortened by the\n                        wrongful act of another, he must be regarded as having lost nothing by the\n                        deprivation of the prospect of future earnings for some period extending\n                        beyond the anticipated date of his premature death. … 204    Lord Scarman (at 981F) describes a plaintiff\n                    whose life expectancy was reduced as suffering both a non-pecuniary and a\n                    pecuniary loss. The pecuniary loss he refers to is the “money [that]\n                    would have been his to deal with as he chose, had he lived”. Lord\n                    Wilberforce was similarly of the view that to the plaintiff, “something\n                    objective” has been lost (see 961G). He rhetorically states (at\n                    961H–962A): … Is he not entitled to say, at one moment I am a man with existing\n                        capability to earn well for 14 years: the next moment can only earn less\n                        well for one year? And why should he be compensated only for the immediate\n                        reduction in his earnings and not for the loss of the whole period for which\n                        he has been deprived of his ability to earn them? To the argument that \"they\n                        are of no value because you will not be there to enjoy them\" can he not\n                        reply, \"yes they are: what is of value to me is not only my opportunity to\n                        spend them enjoyably, but to use such part of them as I do not need for my\n                        dependants, or for other persons or causes which I wish to support. If I\n                        cannot do this, I have been deprived of something on which a value - a\n                        present value - can be placed\"? 205    Indeed, Lord Wilberforce continued with the\n                    trenchant observation that “[f]uture earnings are of value to him in\n                    order that he may satisfy legitimate desires, but these may not correspond with\n                    the allocation which the law makes of money recovered by dependants on account\n                    of his loss. He may wish to benefit some dependents more than, or to the\n                    exclusion of, others … He may not have dependents...” According toPickett v British Rail, it followed from basic\n                    compensatory principles that the plaintiff should be awarded damages for his\n                    loss of earnings during the lost years. 206    The second important feature of the\n                    majority’s reasoning is their holding that recovery does not depend on\n                    whether the plaintiff has dependants. This, in my view, follows from the first\n                    point made above. If the law is compensating the plaintiff for a pecuniary loss\n                    hepersonallysuffers, the existence of dependants\n                    and the extent of loss they suffer must be irrelevant. Lord Edmund-Davies held\n                    (at 973H): … For our present consideration relates solely to thepersonal entitlementof an injured party to recover\n                        damages for the \"lost years,\"regardless both of whether\n                            he has dependants and of whether or not he would (if he has any) make\n                            provision for themout of any compensation awarded to him or\n                        his estate… [emphasis added] 207    Lord Wilberforce (at 962D–F) and Lord\n                    Scarman (at 980F–H) both took a similar position. While Lord Salmon was\n                    concerned about the injustice that the plaintiff’s dependants may suffer\n                    from the denial of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim (see 965B), he held (at\n                    966D): … Certainly, the law can make no distinction between the plaintiff\n                        who looks after dependants and the plaintiff who does not, in assessing the\n                        damages recoverable to compensate the plaintiff for the money he would have\n                        earned during the \"lost years\" but for the defendant's negligence.\n                        … 208    As can be seen from the above discussion,\n                    the majority inPickett v British Railwere in\n                    agreement that a living plaintiff may successfully make a lost years claim,\n                    regardless of whether he or she has dependants. Indeed, even if the plaintiff\n                    has dependants, it does not mean that the plaintiff cannot, during his life,\n                    spend all his monies and savings elsewhere. 209    The final observation I would make about the\n                    reasoning inPickett v British Railfor now is\n                    that while the majority recognised that there were inevitably difficulties in\n                    assessing the quantum of damages for a lost years claim, they were of the view\n                    that the difficulties were not insuperable. Problems of evidence did not affect\n                    the existence of the principle. 210    Lord Wilberforce held (at 962H) that a lost\n                    years claim does not create “insoluble problems of assessment”\n                    (though he did qualify his statement by distinguishing the case of a young\n                    child). In the case of a young adolescent, Lord Wilberforce thought that the\n                    value of lost earnings whilst real would probably be assessed as small. Lord\n                    Salmon stated (at 966E) that “[t]he assessment of these living expenses\n                    may, no doubt, sometimes present difficulties, but certainly no difficulties\n                    which would be insuperable for the courts to resolve”. Lord Edmund-Davies\n                    similarly observed (at 974G) that the lost earnings are not “far too\n                    speculative to be capable of assessment by any court of law”. The\n                    majority inPickett v British Railtherefore\n                    allowed the plaintiff’s lost years claim. 211Pickett v British\n                        Railwas subsequently applied by the House of Lords inGammell v Wilson. While the House of Lords inGammell v Wilsonexpressed some reservations about\n                    granting an Estate Claim, it nevertheless held that followingPickett v British Rail, the deceased had a lost years claim\n                    which survived for the benefit of his estate under s 1 of the Law Reform\n                    (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1934 (UK). 212    Notably, in light of the young ages of the\n                    two plaintiffs inGammell v Wilson(15 and 22\n                    years old), the House of Lords expressed some concern about the difficulty of\n                    assessing damages for their estates’ lost years claim. 213    Lord Diplock (at 250G) described the task of\n                    assessing damages in that case as indulging “in what can be no better\n                    than the merest speculation about what might have happened to the deceased\n                    during a normal working life-span if he had not been prematurely killed”.\n                    Lord Edmund-Davies (at 259E–F) found that “[t]he process of\n                    assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain that it can hardly be\n                    dignified with the name of calculation; it is little more than\n                    speculation”. 214    Yet, notwithstanding these concerns, the\n                    court ultimately allowed the Estate Claim. 215    Indeed, while the Administration of Justice\n                    Act 1982 (UK) effectively reversedGammell v\n                        Wilson, it did not disturb the conclusion that aliving plaintiffhas a claim for lost years:McGregor on Damagesat para 38-108. It merely prevented\n                    a deceased plaintiff’s lost years claim from being vested in his\n                    estate. 216    It is clear that in both Singapore and in\n                    the UK, aliving plaintiffmay successfully bring\n                    a lost years claim.",
        "Lost years claim for a young, living plaintiff": "217    Given the weight of English authority, the\n                    Defendant accepts that a living plaintiff may have a claim for lost\n                        years.[note: 5]Nevertheless, the crux of the\n                    Defendant’s objection to the lost years claimin the\n                        present caseis that ayoungliving\n                    plaintiff should not be allowed an award for loss of earnings during his lost\n                    years. The argument appears to be either (a) young living plaintiffs are an\n                    exception to the rule, or (b) the claim will fail because of the absence of\n                    sufficient objective evidence proving what the young plaintiff’s earnings\n                    are likely to be, or indeed, what the future expenses of the young plaintiff are\n                    likely to be but for the accident and injuries. 218    The main authority the Defendant cites is\n                    the English Court of Appeal case ofCroke v\n                        Wiseman[1982] 1 WLR 71 (“Croke v\n                        Wiseman”). 219    InCroke v\n                        Wiseman, the infant plaintiff was 21 months old when he was\n                    injured by the defendant’s medical negligence. As a result, the\n                    plaintiff’s life expectancy was reduced to 40 years. The court unanimously\n                    held that the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim failed. However, the\n                    majority held (Lord Denning M.R. dissenting) that the infant plaintiff did have\n                    a loss of earnings claim for the time period during which he was expected to\n                    live (ie, up to the age of 40). 220    The Defendant does not dispute that the\n                    Plaintiff in the present case does have a loss of earnings claim for the time\n                    period during which he is expected to live. However, the Defendant relies on the\n                    reasoning inCroke v Wisemanto support its\n                    position that ayoungliving plaintiff should not\n                    be awarded damages for loss of earnings during hislost\n                        years. 221    Griffiths LJ, whom Shaw LJ substantially\n                    agreed with (see 85A), had two main reasons for rejecting the plaintiff’s\n                    lost years claim inCroke v Wiseman. The first\n                    reason is the difficulty of assessing the sum that should be awarded as damages\n                    for loss of earnings during the lost years. Griffiths LJ acknowledged (at 81H)\n                    that while it is “a task of the greatest difficulty to assess an\n                    appropriate sum to award a young child for future loss of earnings”, the\n                    court frequently undertakes such tasks. However, Griffiths LJ was of the view\n                    that in a lost years claim, the court faces aneven greater\n                        difficulty(see 82D): … In attempting to assess the value of a claim for the lost years,\n                        the court is faced with a peculiar difficulty. Not only does it have to\n                        assess what sum the plaintiff might have been earning, butit also has to make an assessment of the sum that would not\n                            have been spent upon the plaintiff's own living expenses and would have,\n                            therefore, been available to spend upon his dependants.\n                        … [emphasis added] 222    Thus, the difficulty of assessment is, in a\n                    sense, doubled. Not only must a court predict what a young plaintiff’sfuture earningswould be, it must also predict\n                    hisfuture expenses. Indeed, the difficulty of\n                    assessing damages for a young plaintiff’s lost years claim was also\n                    acknowledged by the House of Lords inPickett v British\n                        RailandGammell v\n                Wilson. 223    InPickett v British\n                        Rail, Lord Wilberforce expressed the view (at 962H) that in the\n                    case of a young child, “neither present nor future earnings could enter\n                    into the matter” because of the problems of assessment. Lord Salmon\n                    stated (at 966A) that in the case of a young child, “lost earnings are so\n                    unpredictable and speculative that only a minimal sum could properly be\n                    awarded”. 224    InGammell v\n                        Wilson, Lord Fraser of Tullybelton expressed the strong view (at\n                    259D–E) that it would be hard to assess a young plaintiff’s lost\n                    years claim because he had “no established earning capacity or settled\n                    pattern of life”. He observed: … It is particularly difficult to justify the law in cases such as\n                        the present, in each of which the deceased was ayoung\n                            man with no established earning capacity or settled pattern of\n                            life. In such cases it is hardly possible to make a\n                        reasonable estimate of his probable earnings during the \"lost years\" and it\n                        is, I think, quite impossible to take the further step of making a\n                        reasonable estimate of the free balance that would have been available above\n                        the cost of maintaining himself throughout the \"lost years,\" and the amount\n                        of that free balance is the relevant figure for calculating damages. The\n                        process of assessing damages in such cases is so extremely uncertain thatit can hardly be dignified with the name of\n                            calculation; it is little more than speculation. Yet that is\n                        the process which the courts are obliged to carry out at present.\n                        … [emphasis added] 225    This concern was shared by Lord Diplock (at\n                    250G and 253D–E), Lord Russell (at 262A) and Lord Scarman (at\n                    265F). 226    Griffith LJ’s second reason for\n                    rejecting the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim inCroke v Wisemanwas that the plaintiff does not, can never, and\n                    will never have dependants. I find it useful to cite Griffith LJ’s\n                    reasoning (at 82E–F) in full: … In the case of a living plaintiff of mature years whose life\n                        expectation has been shortened and who has dependants, there are compelling\n                        social reasons for awarding a sum of money that he knows will be available\n                        for the support of his dependants after his death. It was this consideration\n                        that led to the result inPickett'scase.\n                        … In the case of a child, however, there are no dependants, and if a\n                        child is dead there can never be any dependants and, if the injuries are\n                        catastrophic, equally there will never be any dependants. It is that child\n                        that will be dependent. … 227    Griffiths LJ thus found that the\n                    “compelling social reason” to grant a lost years claim, that is\n                    the dependants’ loss of support, was not present in the case of a young\n                    child who will never have any dependants. A lost years claim was therefore\n                    denied. 228    The Defendant submits that in Singapore,Eddie Toonis good authority for the rejection\n                    of a Living Plaintiff’s Claim where the plaintiff is young. However, as\n                    explained at [200] above, the High Court inEddie\n                        Tooncannot be taken to have rejected a lost years claim. An\n                    award for lost years was not made because the parties never raised it as an\n                    issue before the court. Indeed, there seems to be a dearth of local authority on\n                    whether ayoung, living plaintiff’s lost\n                    years claim may succeed. 229    In considering this novel issue in the\n                    Singapore context, I propose to first consider Griffith LJ’s concern\n                    regarding the difficulty of assessing damages for a young plaintiff’s lost\n                    years claim. In particular, the court must consider whether any assessment of\n                    damages is so inherently speculative such as to make the claim too remote to be\n                    measurable (as per Lord Scarman inPickett v British\n                        Railat 981H). Thereafter, I shall consider the significance of a\n                    young plaintiff’s absence of dependants. Difficulty of assessing damages 230    The difficulties of assessing damages for a\n                    young plaintiff’s lost years claims can be summarised as follows: (a)     It is often impossible to make a\n                        factual finding, on a balance of probabilities, about what the young\n                        plaintiff is likely to earn in future given working life is such a distant\n                        future. Naturally, the younger he is, the more distant working life is, the\n                        more difficult the fact finding exercise becomes. (b)     It is also often impossible to make a\n                        factual finding, on a balance of probabilities, about the plaintiff’s\n                        likely spending patterns and expenses in the future when he no longer\n                        depends on his parents for a living. 231    Those who oppose awarding a young plaintiff\n                    damages for loss of earnings during lost years would argue that any factual\n                    finding in relation to the above two matters must inevitably be speculative and\n                    arbitrary. They will argue that it therefore cannot be the basis for awarding\n                    damages, and liability for a lost years claim must be denied. 232    I pause to note again that local authorities\n                    have not fully explored the issue of the difficulty of assessing damages for ayoung plaintiff’slost years claim, as\n                    well as its potential implications onliability.\n                    The Singapore Court of Appeal did comment inLee Wei Kong\n                        (CA)(at [33]) that in the case of “injured plaintiffs who\n                    were young at the time of the accident and had yet to commence work at the time\n                    of the trial … the main difficulty with quantifying [loss of future\n                    earnings] … is in determining the multiplicand, as many imponderables\n                    come into play. Undeniably, in this exercise, the court is being asked to look\n                    into the future”. Nevertheless, the court did not have to consider if\n                    such assessment difficulties had an impact onliability(specifically, if it negated liability), especially if\n                    the plaintiff in question were even younger (the plaintiff inLee Wei Kong (CA)was aged 18 at the time of the\n                    accident). 233    I return now to the English authorities to\n                    discuss one final, but rather important, English Court of Appeal case –Iqbal v Whipps Cross University Hospital NHS Trust[2008] P.I.Q.R. P9 (“Iqbal v\n                    Whipps”). 234    The Court of Appeal inIqbal v Whippsmakes important comments on Griffith LJ’s\n                    two concerns inCroke v Wiseman, namely, the\n                    difficulty of assessing damages, and the absence of dependants. However, I shall\n                    limit my discussion to the first concern at this juncture. 235    The plaintiff inIqbal v\n                        Whippswas an infant injured at birth by the defendant’s\n                    medical negligence. As a result, he sustained dystonic tetraplegic cerebral\n                    palsy and his life expectancy was reduced to 41 years. The Court of Appeal\n                    dismissed the infant plaintiff’s lost years claim. While it expressed\n                    great dissatisfaction in doing so, it held that it was bound by its previous\n                    decision inCroke v Wisemanto deny a young\n                    plaintiff’s lost years claim (see [64], [89] and [92]). 236    On the difficulty of assessing damages, the\n                    Court of Appeal’s main point inIqbal v\n                        Whippsseems to be that the task, while difficult, is not\n                    insurmountably so. Courts are in fact required to undertake similar tasks in\n                    similar contexts. 237    One such context is most obviously the\n                    assessment of a young plaintiff’s loss of future earningsduring the time he is expected to live. 238    Gage LJ found it “difficult to accept\n                    that if it is possible to assess prospective future loss of earnings for the\n                    lifetime of a young child, even allowing for the difficulty of assessing the\n                    surplus, it is not possible to assess damages for the lost years” (see\n                    [46]). 239    Rimer LJ held (at [81]–[82]): 81 … True it is that the indications given in bothPickettandGammellwere that the assessment exercise in the case of a child as young as the\n                        present claimant was likely to be too speculative to justify more than a\n                        modest award, if any. But the judge [below] did not feel inhibited by that\n                        … 82 In short, the techniques of assessment had moved on sincePickettandGammell,\n                        and there was no reason to shy away from the assessment of the claim in\n                        respect of the lost years merely because of the extreme youth of the\n                        claimant. In principle, I would not fault that approach. … 240    Notably, however, Gage LJ acknowledged at\n                    [72] of his judgment that the more advanced techniques of assessment the court\n                    referred to,ie, the “Ogden Tables”\n                    used in the UK, “cannot offer any help on the element of speculation\n                    identified inPickettandGammell”, which relates to “the surplus from which\n                    the damages for the lost years are derived”. In other words, it seems\n                    that the actuarial tables currently available in the UK do not assist the court\n                    in determining the appropriate discount to apply to take into account expenses.\n                    Moreover, in the present case, I note that I do not have the assistance of any\n                    actuarial calculations. 241    Having considered the submissions and\n                    authorities above, I find that the difficulty of assessing damages for the\n                    Plaintiff’s lost years claim in this casedoes\n                        notprevent the claim from succeeding. I do not think it is\n                    impossible for the court to make a finding on how the Plaintiff’s life\n                    would have turned out if the natural and ordinary course of events were allowed\n                    to unfold, without the tragic intervention of the present accident. Of course,\n                    it is impossible to predict with precision theexactlife the Plaintiff would have led, the exact income he\n                    would have earned in the future, and the exact living expenses he would have\n                    incurred. However, this is not necessary for an assessment of damages claim.\n                    Such certainty is never possible in any assessment of damages involving the\n                    estimation of loss of earnings. Indeed, it bears repeating that inCroke v Wiseman, damages were awarded to the young\n                    living plaintiff (21 months old) for the loss of earnings during the remainder\n                    of his life. Factors taken into account included actuarial tables, the national\n                    average wage for a young man, and family background. 242    The court is entitled to use evidence of\n                    general income and expenditure patterns of the average Singaporean to inform its\n                    decision on the damages that it should award for the present Plaintiff’s\n                    lost years claim. Indeed, the authorities, as well as both parties, acknowledge\n                    that this is so with respect to future incomeduring the time\n                        the Plaintiff is likely to live(ie, up to the age of 38). If the difficulties of assessment do not\n                    preclude an award for loss of future income during the time the Plaintiff is\n                    likely to live, there is no reason why such difficulties, which are almost\n                    identical in nature, should preclude a claim for loss of income during the lost\n                    years. 243    I acknowledge, as Griffiths LJ points out inCroke v Wiseman, that the courtmayface an additional difficulty of having to\n                    “make an assessment of the sum that would not have been spent upon the\n                    plaintiff’s own living expenses” (Croke v\n                        Wisemanat 82D) in assessing damages for a lost years claim. In\n                    other words, besides assessing the Plaintiff’s future income, the court\n                    may also have to assess the Plaintiff’sfuture\n                        expenditure. 244    However, this first assumes that the English\n                    approach of deducting future expenditure (living expenses) from the estimated\n                    future earnings during the lost years is an approach that also applies in\n                    Singapore. 245    Second, even if this court decides to follow\n                    the English approach, I am of the view that the task of assessing a young\n                    plaintiff’sfuture expenditure patterns (living\n                        expenses)whilst clearly difficult, is not any more difficult\n                    than assessing a young plaintiff’sfuture\n                        income. It is as hard to tell whether a young plaintiff will end\n                    up extravagant or thrifty, as it is to tell whether he will end up a high or low\n                    income earner. In both cases, I do not deny that the use of national averages\n                    can only provide a blunt and broad-brushed approximation. However, if such\n                    approximations are sufficiently precise for the assessment of damages for a\n                    young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings during his expected lifetime, it\n                    must follow that it also is sufficiently precise for the assessment of damages\n                    for a young plaintiff’s lost years claim (even if it comprises two\n                    components – an estimation of future incomeandfuture expenses). I further mention in passing,\n                    notwithstanding the House of Lords’ reservations about the speculative\n                    nature of the assessment of damages for a young plaintiff’s lost years\n                    claim inGammell v Wilson, it nevertheless\n                    affirmed the lower court’s decision to make such an award. 246    This leads me to my third point. As Gage LJ\n                    opined inIqbal v Whipps(at [79]), concerns about\n                    the difficulty of assessment do not go towards showing that “as a matter\n                    of principle, a young child will have no claim in respect of lost years”.\n                    It merely might negate liability because the loss is tooremote(as per Lord Scarman inPickett v\n                        British Railat 981B). 247    There can be no dispute that the accident\n                    directly caused the Plaintiff’s reduced life expectancy. Denying a young\n                    plaintiff’s lost years claim on the ground of excessive speculation or\n                    arbitrariness in assessment would have thepractical\n                        effectof pegging his loss atzero,\n                    even whilst the court acknowledgesin principlethat the plaintiff has suffered loss that ordinarily ought to be compensated\n                    from having his life expectancy so reduced. 248    Therefore, for the above reasons, I do not\n                    think that the difficulty of assessing damages for the Plaintiff’s lost\n                    years claim in this case precludes the claim from succeeding. 249    I now consider whether the fact that the\n                    Plaintiff does not have dependants might defeat his lost years\n                claim. Absence of dependants 250    While the relevance of dependants has been\n                    alluded to above, it is helpful to examine why the presence of dependants\n                    mattered to the previous courts that have heard such claims. When a plaintiff\n                    has his life expectancy reduced (whether he dies immediately or has fewer years\n                    left to live), the dependants whom he supports with his monthly wage clearly\n                    suffer a loss. They lose financial support in the years that the plaintiff would\n                    have lived but for the accident. The law has been concerned with ensuring that\n                    these dependants are taken care off in an award of damages. 251    This social concern explains the\n                    availability of a dependants’ claim in Singapore under s 20 of the Civil\n                    Law Act, and in the UK under s 1 of the Fatal Accidents Act 1976 (UK). It also\n                    explains why the courts have been concerned with ensuring alternative\n                    compensation mechanisms for dependants where the abovementioned statutory\n                    provisions do not apply. InPickett v British\n                    Rail, the majority was acutely aware of the fact that the dependants\n                    would no longer have a statutory action under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976\n                    because the plaintiff had obtained judgment against the tortfeasor when he was\n                    alive. This was arguably one reason why the House of Lords found it just to\n                    award damages for loss of earnings during the lost years (see for examplePickett v British Railat\n                    964H–965C). 252    Traces of this concern for dependants can\n                    also be found in Singapore authorities dealing with lost years claims. InLow Kok Tong, the Court of Appeal commented\n                    (at [14]) that “[i]t could be questioned with some justification why\n                    persons other than the actual dependants of a deceased should be unjustly\n                    enriched by an award to the estate for the “lost years””.\n                    In the same vein, inAu Yeong Wing Loong, the High\n                    Court held (at [59]): The basis for awarding damages for the years by which the\n                        plaintiff’s life has been reduced when computing future loss of\n                        earnings is that the plaintiff must provide for his dependants. The\n                        multiplier for loss of future earnings for the plaintiff’s working\n                        life is accordingly based,inter alia, on the\n                        working life of the plaintiff prior to his injuries. 253    One might thus argue that if the basis for\n                    awarding a lost years claim is the loss to the dependants, a plaintiff with no\n                    dependants should not be awarded any compensation for loss of earnings during\n                    the lost years. 254    In my view, such an argument is wrong. In\n                    the present case, I find that the Plaintiff’s absence of dependants or the\n                    prospect of dependants does not defeat his claim for loss of income during the\n                    lost years. In holding this view, I find myself supported by both legal\n                    authorities and principles. 255    As discussed above (see [206]–[208] of\n                    this judgment), the majority inPickett v British\n                        Railtook a clear position on this issue. The House of Lords held\n                    that in allowing a lost years claim, the law cannot distinguish between\n                    plaintiffs who support dependants, and those who do not:Pickett v British Railat 966D. 256    This interpretation ofPickett v British Railis supported by Rimer LJ at [78] ofIqbal v Whipps. There was discussion inPickettas to\n                        whether the real losers in respect of a lost years earnings claim were the\n                        claimant’s dependents. Whatever the force of that, the four members of\n                        the House who were in agreement in allowing a lost years’ earnings\n                        claim recognised that it was nevertheless a loss suffered by the claimant\n                        himself in respect of which he was entitled to recover in his own right\n                        … There is nothing in their speeches to support the view that success\n                        on such a claim is conditional on proof that the claimant has, or would\n                        have, dependents who could or might benefit from any recovery\n                        … 257    The comments made by Gage LJ inIqbal v Whipps(at [35]) are also illuminating: In my judgment,Gammellmakes quite clear,\n                        what might be said to be less clear fromPickett, that the age of a victim is not as a matter of\n                        principle relevant to the issue of whether or not a claim can be made for\n                        the lost years. Further,the lack of dependants cannot be\n                            a factor which defeats a claim for damages for loss of earnings in the\n                            lost years. When it comes to the assessment of damages for\n                        the lost years the issues are evidential and not matters of principle.\n                        … [emphasis added] 258    It is clear that the Court of Appeal inIqbal v Whippsat [45], [46] and [83]\n                    expressed the view that the earlier decision inCroke v\n                        Wisemanthat the absence of dependants in the case of a young\n                    child was fatal to the claim for loss of earnings in the lost years was\n                    inconsistent with previous House of Lords authority (Pickett\n                        v British RailandGammell v\n                    Wilson). That said, the Court of Appeal regarded itself bound by the\n                    decision inCroke v Wiseman. 259    A living plaintiff brings an action in his\n                    own capacity. In my view, it must follow that theonlyloss he can claim for ishis\n                        own. Indeed, even in the case of claims for future nursing and\n                    home-care where these are provided gratuitously by a family member, as\n                    emphasised above, the court awards a plaintiff damages, assessed in relation to\n                    the caregiver’s loss of future earnings as aloss to\n                        the plaintiff himself, and not to his caregiver. Similarly, to\n                    succeed, a living plaintiff’s lost years claim must beconceptuallyfounded on a plaintiff’s personal loss,\n                    rather than his dependant’s loss. 260    I am therefore of the view that the absence\n                    of dependants or the prospect of dependents, does not defeat a young living\n                    plaintiff’s lost years claim. While the High Court inAu Yeong Wing Loongdid suggest (as noted above) that the basis\n                    for awarding a lost years claim is the loss to the dependants, the comment was\n                    strictlyobiterand was intended more to explain\n                    the normative reasons for awarding a lost years claim rather than establish a\n                    legal test.",
        "Conclusion on lost years and the appropriate multiplier": "261    In conclusion, the authorities clearly\n                    establish that a living plaintiff has a lost years claim. Moreover, an exception\n                    should not be made just because the living plaintiff is young. In my view, the\n                    existing authorities and principles support this position. Therefore, I find\n                    that the Plaintiff’s claim for loss of earnings during the lost years\n                    succeeds. 262    In this regard, I affirm the AR’s\n                    decision to adopt a multiplier of 9 years for the period in which the Plaintiff\n                    is likely to live (16 years of working life). Regarding the lost years, I accept\n                    the Plaintiff’s assumption that he would have worked until the age of 62\n                    if not for the accident. The number of “lost years” is thus 24. In\n                    view of the above, I find that a multiplier of 8 years for the lost years claim\n                    is appropriate. A more substantial discount from 24 years takes into account the\n                    fact that the more distant in time, the greater the exposure to the vicissitudes\n                    of life and the more advantage is gained from accelerated receipt. What remains\n                    is the need to determine the appropriate multiplicand.",
        "Multiplicand": "263    The first question that arises is whether\n                    the multiplicand adopted for the lost years should be different from that\n                    adopted for the period in which the Plaintiff is expected to live. 264    In my view, it should be. In awarding\n                    damages for a lost years claim, Singapore authorities do support the English\n                    approach of deducting a plaintiff’s anticipated expenses from his loss of\n                    earnings: (a)     In awarding an Estate Claim, the\n                        Court of Appeal inLow Kok Tongheld (at [7])\n                        that with respect to the deceased’s loss of earnings during the lost\n                        years, “damages should be computed after deduction of his probable\n                        living expenses during that period”. (b)     The High Court inAu Yeong\n                            Wing Loongsimilarly deducted the living plaintiff’s\n                        estimated living expenses during the lost years in awarding damages for loss\n                        of earnings during that period (see [50] and [69]). 265    I note that no such deduction of expenses\n                    was made inRamesh v Chua. The High Court seemed\n                    to have used the same multiplicand for the period during the time the plaintiff\n                    was expected to live, and during the lost years period (see [38]–[39]).\n                    Nevertheless, it appears that this issue was never raised to the court. The\n                    discussion on the lost years claim was notably brief. NeitherLow Kok TongnorAu Yeong Wing\n                        Loongwas considered by the High Court inRamesh v Chua. I therefore find that on balance, the local\n                    authorities we have suggest that different multiplicands should be used for the\n                    period in which the plaintiff is expected to live, and the lost years period. In\n                    the former, the court simply awards the plaintiff his estimated loss of\n                    earnings. In the latter, the court awards the plaintiff his estimated loss of\n                    earnings after deducing his estimated personal living expenses. Multiplicand for the period during which the plaintiff is expected to\n                live 266    To assess the appropriate multiplicand for\n                    the period during which the plaintiff is expected to live, the court is\n                    concerned with assessing the fair value of income that the Plaintiff may be\n                    treated as being likely to earn should the accident not have happened. In this\n                    case, given that the Plaintiff was only 9 years old at the time of the accident,\n                    it is very difficult for the court to assess the likely income he would have\n                    been earning had the accident not happened. There is neither a track record of\n                    past earnings, nor is there any clear indication as to the educational levels\n                    the Plaintiff was likely to attain. As mentioned earlier, recourse to national\n                    averages is thus inevitable. Both parties accept that followingEddie Toon, the mean commencing salaries of young\n                    workers should be used as the basis for calculating the multiplicand (see the\n                    AR’s Judgment at [39]–[40]). What they disagree on is which\n                    occupational groups ought (or ought not) to be taken into account in the\n                    calculation. 267    The AR adopted a multiplicand of $1,723.24.\n                    She first took the average of the figures set out in the table at [42] of the\n                    AR’s Judgment, which contains the median monthly wage of persons across\n                    eight occupational groups in the age-group of 25 to 29 years old. The figure\n                    derived was $2,059.25. She then applied a discount based on the average annual\n                    basic wage change over a 10-year period (see the AR’s Judgment at [48]) to\n                    reflect the fact that the court was concerned with the median commencing salary\n                    of personsaged 22 years old(rather than 25 to 29\n                    years old). She derived the final figure of $1,723.24, which she accordingly\n                    adopted as the multiplicand to assess the Plaintiff’s loss of future\n                    earnings. 268    Both the Plaintiff and the Defendant have\n                    appealed the AR’s decision on the multiplicand. The Plaintiff’s main\n                    submission is that the multiplicand should not have been adjusted downwards from\n                    the average of $2,059.25 (for workers in the age-group of 25–29 years old)\n                    to reflect the fact that the Plaintiff is assumed to commence work at age 22.\n                    This wrongly assumes the Plaintiff’s salary would remain stagnant\n                    throughout his working life. The Plaintiff referred the court to the Court of\n                    Appeal’s decision inKoh Chai Kwang v Teo Ai Ling (by\n                        her next friend, Chua Wee Bee)[2011] 3 SLR 610\n                        (“Teo Ai Ling (CA)”) at [58],\n                    where the Court of Appeal took into consideration the fact that the plaintiff\n                    would have had an average annual salary increment of 7.3% in calculating the\n                        multiplicand.[note: 6]The Plaintiff therefore submits that\n                    the average wage for workers in the age-group of 25–29 years old should be\n                    used as the multiplicand without a discount. I note that the Plaintiff has not\n                    taken issue with themethodthe AR used to\n                    discount the average wage for persons in the age-group of 25–29 years old;\n                    he only takes issue with the fact that the discount was applied. 269    The Defendant’s main submission on\n                    appeal is that the AR should not have taken into account the top two income\n                    earning occupational groups, “Managers” (median wage of $3,663)\n                    and “Professionals” (median wage of $3,300), in calculating the\n                    multiplicand. This is because the Plaintiff was less than likely to attain\n                    tertiary education.[note: 7]The Defendant makes the following\n                    points in support of that submission: (a)     The AR wrongly held that the\n                        Plaintiff has an equal chance of becoming a professional or a\n                            labourer.[note: 8] (b)     The Plaintiff’s academic results reveal\n                        that he was an inconsistent and average to below average student. The\n                        Plaintiff’s results only picked up slightly in the first half of\n                        Primary Three despite tuition.[note: 9] (c)     The Plaintiff’s family background is less than\n                        ideal. The Plaintiff’s mother has gone through two failed marriages,\n                        and his biological father was irresponsible and left the home. The\n                        Plaintiff’s mother and her present husband were both earning only a\n                        modest income at the time of the accident.[note: 10] 270    I first address the Plaintiff’s\n                    submission that the AR should not have based the multiplicand on the average\n                    commencing wage of a person aged 22. On the one hand, the Plaintiff is correct\n                    thatTeo Ai Ling (CA)suggests the court should\n                    take into account salary increments over a plaintiff’s working life in\n                    determining the multiplicand. However, inTeo Ai Ling\n                        (CA), there is considerabledictathat suggests a different approach might apply for young children who have not\n                    started work. In this regard, I refer to the Court of Appeal’s comment at\n                    [45]: We recognise that for this purpose there is a distinct difference between,\n                        say, a young child of five years old and a student like the Respondent who\n                        has completed her \"O\" levels and has embarked on tertiary education,ie, a polytechnic course. In the case of a\n                        five-year-old child, admittedly it would be difficult to reasonably predict\n                        what that child would become. Will he graduate from university and become a\n                        doctor, lawyer or engineer? Is medical science able to provide an answer?\n                        Fortunately, we are not here concerned with such a child. Here, the\n                        Respondent, if not for the accident, would have probably completed the\n                        Diploma and started work, whether in the food business or the civil service\n                        or any other job. All she has now is her \"O\" level certificate.\n                        … 271    The Court of Appeal did not explain the\n                    approach it thinks a court should adopt for a young child. However, there is at\n                    some suggestion that a different approach might be appropriate. 272    The approach taken by the High Court inEddie Toonto the assessment of the\n                    multiplicand for a young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings is\n                    instructive. The High Court inEddie Toonheld (at\n                    [51]): Even if I adopt the learned assistant registrar's basis for the assessment\n                        of the loss of future earnings, then in arriving at the multiplicand,I would use the mean commencing salaries of all\n                            occupations for young workers and not the average monthly earnings of a\n                            Singaporean for all occupations. The average monthly earnings\n                        of a Singaporean would have taken into account the salaries of those\n                        employees nearing retirement age. [emphasis added] 273    Indeed, it is clear from [47] ofEddie Toonthat this holding was an affirmation of the\n                    High Court’s decision inPeh Diana and another v Tan\n                        Miang Lee[1991] 1 SLR(R) 22 (“Peh\n                        Diana”). I find it useful to cite the reasoning in [28] ofPeh Diana: … Therefore, I find great difficulty in accepting that in the case\n                        of a person who has never worked, the national average wage should be used\n                        for purposes of working out his loss of future earnings. I understand the\n                        English courts have used something like this in calculating the loss of\n                        future earnings in respect of fairly young children,eg\n                            Croke v Wiseman[1982] 1 WLR 71; [1981] 3 All ER 852 where\n                        the child was seven years old at the date of trial. Even so, the wage\n                        adopted by the court inCrokewas not the\n                        national average wage but the national average wagefor a\n                            young man. That I think is quite different. … The\n                        amount to be taken in computing loss of future earnings followingCroke, must be that of a young stenographic\n                        secretary and not someone who had worked for some years. … [emphasis in original] 274    In my view,Peh\n                        DianaandEddie Toonestablish the\n                    approach that ought to be taken by Singapore courts in assessing the\n                    multiplicand for a young plaintiff’s loss of future earnings.Eddie Toonestablishes that the “mean commencing\n                    salary” of young workers should be adopted;Peh\n                        Dianaholds that the “national average wagefor a young man” should be adopted. It is\n                    therefore clear that in the present case, the multiplicand should be calculated\n                    based on the average wages of younger workers. The only question is whether the\n                    court should insist on using the Plaintiff’s estimated “commencing\n                    salary” at the age of 22 (as perEddie\n                    Toon), or whether the average wage of young workers more generally\n                    should be used, in which case, the salary range for workers aged 25–29 may\n                    arguably be a fairer range to consider. 275    On balance, I preferEddie Toon’sapproach of using thecommencing salaryof young workers. In coming to this decision,\n                    I have taken note of the following: (a)     The House of Lords’ caution\n                        inGammell v Wilson(as\n                            perLord Edmund-Davies at 259A) “counselling\n                        moderation” where an assessment of damages is inevitably speculative\n                        “to reflect the high degree of speculation” that is\n                        involved. (b)     The\n                        arbitrariness of taking the age-group 25–29 (bringing us to an average\n                        of 27 years old) as a representative of the average wage of “young\n                        persons” just because that is the age group which statisticians have\n                        decided to use. 276    I therefore affirm the AR’s approach\n                    of basing the multiplicand on the average commencing wage of a 22-year old\n                    (being the year the Plaintiff is assumed to start work) and applying an\n                    appropriate discount to the figures in evidence to reflect that. 277    I now consider the Defendant’s\n                    submission that the AR should not have taken into account the top two highest\n                    earning occupational groups on the ground that, on a balance of probabilities,\n                    the Plaintiff would not have completed tertiary education even without the\n                    accident. 278    In this regard, the AR, citing [49] ofEddie Toon, rejected the Defendant’s\n                    submissions. The High Court inEddie Toonat [49]\n                    held: … The plaintiff's academic abilities based on Primary 1 results is\n                        not a reliable guide as to what the plaintiff's achievements at \"O\" or \"A\"\n                        Levels would have been if he had not met with the accident.It is possible for the plaintiff to obtain a university\n                            education or to drop out from school in his teens. That is really a\n                            matter for speculation. [emphasis added] 279    The AR therefore reasoned (at [38] of the\n                    AR’s Judgment) that little weight should be given to the plaintiff’s\n                    primary school results. The court simply cannot make a finding that, on a\n                    balance of probabilities, the Plaintiff would not have attended tertiary\n                    education: [46] of the AR’s Judgment. 280    On the other hand, it is relatively clear to\n                    me thatLee Wei Kong (CA)(at [31]–[32])\n                    does support the proposition that a plaintiff’s family background, along\n                    with school results, is at least a relevant factor that a court ought to take\n                    into account in assessing the multiplicand. With respect, I agree. 281    In my view, the question before me isnotwhether the Plaintiff’s pre-accident\n                    school results or family background are relevant to the determination of the\n                    multiplicand. There is no doubt that the authorities suggest they are. In this\n                    regard, I accept the Defendant’s submissions that Imusttake those facts into account. The court is asked to gaze\n                    into a crystal ball and, based onallthe relevant\n                    facts it has before it, predictas accurately as is\n                        reasonably possiblewhat the Plaintiff is likely to earn in a\n                    counter-factual future. The only question, however, is whether the undoubtedly\n                    relevant evidence on the Plaintiff’s results and family background issufficientin the present case to allow anaffirmative factual finding(on a balance of\n                    probabilities) that the Plaintiffwill notcomplete tertiary education and end up as a “Manager” or\n                    “Professional”. The burden is on the Defendant to show this. If\n                    the evidence does not allow an affirmative factual finding either way, the court\n                    has no choice but to assume every possibility is equally likely. It would then\n                    take the average wage acrossall occupational\n                        groupsas the basis for the multiplicand as the AR had done\n                    below. 282    Framed in this light, and having considered\n                    the evidence before me, I do not think I have enough evidence to make an\n                    affirmative factual finding that the Plaintiff will not complete tertiary\n                    education and/or end up as a “Manager” or\n                    “Professional”. It is still too early to tell. The Defendant tried\n                    to distinguishEddie Toonon the ground that the\n                    plaintiff inEddie Toonwas seven and a half years\n                    old, while the Plaintiff in the present case is nine. I am not persuaded that\n                    the year and a half makes a difference on the present facts. I am of the view\n                    that,at this stage, it is impossible to find that\n                    the Plaintiffwill notend up completing tertiary\n                    education. Perhaps, one might argue that the very uncertainty caused by the\n                    Plaintiff’s youth has worked to his advantage. That might be so. However,\n                    in cases like the present, where “many imponderables come into\n                    play” (Lee Wei Kong (CA)at [33]), the\n                    court can only come to thebest approximationof\n                    what is just. I therefore uphold the AR’s finding on this\n                front. 283    Given the analysis above, I reject both the\n                    Plaintiff’s and the Defendant’s appeal against the AR’s\n                    decision on the multiplier for loss of future earnings during the period the\n                    Plaintiff is expected to live. I affirm the AR’s decision to adopt\n                    $1,723.24 as the multiplicand. Multiplicand for the lost years period 284    Given my determination that the multiplicand\n                    for the Plaintiff’s loss of earnings should be $1,723.24, the only\n                    question here is how much should be deducted for the Plaintiff’s expenses\n                    to determine the multiplicand for the lost years. 285    InLow Kok\n                        Tong, the Court of Appeal held (at [13]) that the\n                    deceased’s “earning after expenses” was $150. Unfortunately,\n                    it is not clear from the report of the case as to how this figure was derived.\n                    The Court of Appeal simply noted that the estate had “urged us to apply a\n                    multiplier of 16 years with earnings ranging from $170 to $200 per\n                    month”. The court also noted that the deceased was earning $122.47 per\n                    month during national service, and $150 per month as a shop assistant before\n                    that. 286    InAu Yeong Wing\n                        Loong, the court made the deduction for living expenses based on\n                    the plaintiff’s “living expense before the accident”: at\n                    [69]. In that case, both parties agreed to that approach. It should be noted\n                    that the plaintiff inAu Yeong Wing Loongwas\n                    already a working adult with a relatively stable pattern of expenses, making it\n                    easier for the court to come to a conclusion as to the plaintiff’s monthly\n                    expenses. Nevertheless, I note that the court’s decision on the\n                    appropriate deduction for expenses appears to have been ultimately based on a\n                    rough estimation driven by submissions rather than specific evidence. As the\n                    High Court notes at [68]–[69]: 68    Counsel were asked to assist the court by\n                            indicating the amount that should be deducted for living expenses for\n                            the lost years having regard to the fact that no evidence was led. Mr\n                            Yap suggested the figure of $500 per day. Ms Ng was of the view that\n                            $150 would be proper. 69    This is a case of a man who was living with the\n                            family and working for a family concern. His expenses incurred in the\n                            course of his travel for business would in all probabilities be met by\n                            his employer. The chances are he would have been left with most of the\n                            money that he earned. $500 pm works out to roughly $17 per day. Both\n                            counsel were agreed that the deduction for living expenses should be on\n                            the basis of living expenses before the accident. … There therefore does not seem to have been a detailed factual\n                        inquiry into the plaintiff’s pre-accident\n                expenditure. 287    Indeed, as a matter of law, one potential\n                    question that arises is how “expenses” ought to be defined, and\n                    related to that, what the legal justification for deducting expenses even is.\n                    During the “lost years”, a plaintiff certainly would not incur any\n                    expenses – on that basis, it may be thought fair that the plaintiff should\n                    be awarded a sum based on the income he would have left after deducting the\n                    expenses he would have had to incur if he were alive. However, should the\n                    deduction be based on the minimum sum necessary to meet a person’s basic\n                    needs, or should it take into account a plaintiff’s spending habits (if\n                    there is available evidence on that)? In the case of a young plaintiff, where no\n                    available evidence exists on spending habits, should national averages on saving\n                    and expenditure rates be used instead? 288    InPickett v British\n                        Railat 962A, Lord Wilberforce observed … To the argument that “they are of no value because you\n                        will not be there to enjoy them” can he not reply, “yes they\n                        are: what is of value to me is not only my opportunity to spend them\n                        enjoyably, but to use such part of them as I do not need for my dependants,\n                        or for other persons or causes which I wish to support\n                        …” I fully agree. Nevertheless, given that the parties did not\n                        make detailed submissions on this point, this is not an appropriate case for\n                        me to explore the issues any further than I already\n                have. 289    In the present case, it would have been\n                    preferable if there were evidence and submissions on the correct approach the\n                    court should take in determining what expenses to deduct, as well as statistics\n                    on, for example, the average expenditure of Singaporeans in the relevant age or\n                    income group (whether in absolute value, or as a percentage of income). In the\n                    absence of such evidence, I must make a decision based on the material and\n                    submissions before me. In coming to my decision, I am reminded of the well-known\n                    aphorism that it is better to be roughly right than to be precisely wrong. Given\n                    my earlier holding, it would be wrong to award the Plaintiff damages for loss of\n                    earnings in respect of the lost yearswithouttaking into account living expenses. The Plaintiff in his submissions refers to\n                    a number of Canadian decisions on assessment of living expenses. These cases are\n                    not binding on me and in any case, it is evident that much depended on the\n                    evidence, facts and circumstances of each case. The range of deductions in the\n                    Canadian cases appeared to have varied from 33% to 70%.[note: 11] 290    In the present case, I am well aware of the\n                    need for caution, especially given the nature of the exercise, which is\n                    speculative at best. I note that in Singapore, the minimum saving for a working\n                    person derives from the CPF scheme. This provides the court with a base-line\n                    figure of approximately 20% (based on present rates) for savings, as well as 17%\n                    from employer’s contributions. The wage earner is free to spend or save\n                    the rest of the salary as he or she thinks fit. In the decision ofAu Yeong Wing Loong, the Court adopted the figure\n                    suggested by the Defendant of $500 per month for expenses for a plaintiff based\n                    on a salary multiplicand of $3000 per month. It is stressed that no evidence had\n                    been led in that case on expenses, and the court had determined that the\n                    deduction for expenses should be based on the plaintiff’s established\n                    spending habits. Such evidence is unavailable in this case. The precedent is\n                    therefore not of much help in this case. In these circumstances, I am of the\n                    view that a plaintiff’s CPF savings is a good estimate of the savings he\n                    would have had after expenditure. This is approximately 40% of his\n                    salary. 291    Thus, in my view, the applicable\n                    multiplicand for the loss of income during the lost years is therefore $1,723.24\n                    x 40% = $689.30.",
        "Conclusion on the award for the Plaintiff’s loss of future\n                earnings": "292    In summary, I affirm the AR’s award of\n                    $233,878.14 for the Plaintiff’s loss of future earnings during the period\n                    he is expected to live, and award the Plaintiff $71,687.20 for his loss of\n                    future earnings during the lost years. The total award for the Plaintiff’s\n                    loss of future earnings is thus $305,565.34. 293    The award for the lost years is derived as\n                    follows: $689.30 x 13 months x 8-year multiplier =$71,687.20",
        "The Provisional Damages Order": "294    The AR ordered that the Plaintiff may apply\n                    for future damages to be assessed if within three years of her order, he\n                    requires a permanent tracheostomy as a result of contracting pneumonia (see the\n                    AR’s Judgment at [89]). The Defendant appeals against this order on the\n                    following grounds: first, that the claim for provisional damages was not\n                    sufficiently pleaded, and second, that the AR arbitrarily selected the duration\n                    of three years without proper medical evidence to support the time frame\n                        stipulated.[note: 12] 295    There is little dispute on the applicable\n                    legal principles governing the award of provisional damages. In this regard, I\n                    reproduce the legal principles derived fromTan Juay\n                        Muihelpfully delineated at [82] of the AR’s\n                    Judgment: (a)     The risk of development of the\n                        contingency must be a clear risk and not one that is fanciful (at [90] ofTan Juay Mui). (b)     The contingency must be objectively\n                        identifiable and it must be objectively determinable whether the contingency\n                        has occurred. If so, when it does occur, a provisional damages award may be\n                        made. In order to prevent future dispute, one must be able to define the\n                        precise contingency, upon which further damages should be awarded (at [84]\n                        ofTan Juay Mui). (c)     The contingency must be a clear-cut event. If\n                        you cannot specify at what point the contingency has occurred, then the\n                        contingency cannot be objectively determined as the law requires (at [87] ofTan Juay Mui). (d)     There must be some evidence as to the\n                        degree of such risk or when such changes were likely to occur. The evidence\n                        must support a finding that there was a reasonable likelihood of the\n                        condition occurring within the not too distant future (at [86] ofTan Juay Mui). (e)     A time frame based on medical evidence should be\n                        specified for the plaintiff to return to apply for further damages (at [90]\n                        ofTan Juay Mui). 296    When the parties came before me on 13 April\n                    2015, the Defendant confirmed that it does not dispute that requirements (a) to\n                    (d) are satisfied. Further, it was common ground that medical evidence was\n                    indeed lacking on the appropriate time frame for an award of provisional\n                    damages. In the circumstances, I directed that further evidence on the issue of\n                    the appropriate time frame for provisional damages should be sought from the\n                    Plaintiff’s doctors, Dr Henry Tan (“Dr Tan”) and Dr Annette\n                    Ang (“Dr Ang”). I remitted the matter to the AR, who heard\n                    evidence from Dr Tan and Dr Ang on 3 July 2015. Parties came back before me on 7\n                    September 2015 to make submissions on,inter alia,\n                    the appropriate award for provisional damages. 297    I shall first deal with the preliminary\n                    objection based on pleadings, and if necessary, deal with the appropriate award\n                    of provisional damages in light of the new evidence.",
        "Pleadings": "298    At para (h) of the “Particulars of\n                    General Damages” in the Plaintiff’s statement of claim, the\n                    Plaintiff prayed for provisional damages without giving further particulars.\n                    This was the only part of the statement of claim that mentioned provisional\n                    damages. 299    The Defendant cites the decision ofACD (by her next friend B) v See Mun Li[2009]\n                    SGHC 217 at [23] in support of the proposition that in making a claim for\n                    provisional damages, a plaintiff must plead with specificity the exact medical\n                    condition which, if it develops in the future, is to form the triggering event\n                    to apply for further damages.[note: 13]I accept this as a general\n                    proposition of law. I also accept the Defendant’s submission based onPT Prima International Development v Kempinski Hotels SA\n                        and other appeals[2012] 4 SLR 98 (“PT\n                        Prima”) that the object of pleadings is to,inter alia, require each party to give fair and proper\n                    notice to his opponent of the case he has to meet.[note: 14]On this basis, it is clear thatprima facie, the Plaintiff’s pleadings\n                    are insufficiently particularised to support the present claim for provisional\n                    damages. 300    However, it is important to note that the\n                    failure to plead a particular point does not automatically bar the party who\n                    failed to plead the point from raising it at the hearing. As seen from the\n                    approach of the Court of Appeal inPT Primaat\n                    [51], consideration will also be given to whether the other party has suffered\n                    anyprejudicefrom the lack of\n                notice. 301    The Defendant’s counsel appears to\n                    accept this, and submitted initially that his client was prejudiced because he\n                    was caught by surprise at the hearing before the AR and was not given the\n                    opportunity to ask the doctors the necessary questions in relation to the issue\n                    of provisional damages.[note: 15]It is abundantly clear now that after the 3 July\n                    2015 hearing, when further evidence was heard by the AR, the Defendant had ample\n                    opportunity to prepare and ask all the questions it wished to ask Dr Tan and Dr\n                    Ang. 302    While the Defendant maintains an objection\n                    to an award of provisional damages in its submissions dated 7 September 2015 on\n                    the basis of the Plaintiff’s failure to plead the issue, he did not\n                    explain why he continues to be prejudiced notwithstanding the opportunity he has\n                    been given to question the doctors.[note: 16]Thus, I am of the view that the\n                    Plaintiff’s pleadings, while disappointingly bare, is not an impediment to\n                    its present claim for provisional damages.",
        "Appropriate award of provisional damages": "303    From the evidence given on 3 July 2015, the\n                    consensus of the doctors appears to be that an award of provisional damages\n                    should be made. Indeed, apart from the Plaintiff’s deficient pleadings,\n                    the Defendant raises no other ground post the 3 July 2015 hearing to dispute\n                    this. 304    Dr Ang’s evidence is that the\n                    Plaintiff should be observed for another ten years until he enters young\n                        adulthood.[note: 17]Dr Tan’s evidence is less clear.\n                    He agreed that if the Plaintiff goes on for another three to four years without\n                    developing pneumonia severe enough to require a permanent tracheostomy, the risk\n                    of him requiring a permanent tracheostomy diminishes.[note: 18]However, he also gave evidence that in his view,\n                    the risk of requiring a permanent tracheostomy remains constant throughout the\n                    estimated 27 years of the Plaintiff’s life, and that he advises monitoring\n                    the Plaintiff throughout.[note: 19]In a bid to be helpful, he suggested that at\n                    the minimum, a time frame of 13.5 years,ie, half\n                    the Plaintiff’s lifespan, should be set.[note: 20] 305    From my brief summary of the evidence, it is\n                    clear that there is little medical consensus on the appropriate time frame.\n                    Based on Dr Tan’s evidence that the risk that a permanent tracheostomy\n                    would be required diminishes after three to four years, the Defendant submits\n                    that three to four years is an appropriate time frame. Based on Dr Ang’s\n                    evidence, the Plaintiff submits that eight years is an appropriate time frame\n                    because this would take care of the Plaintiff until he reaches 21 years\n                    old. 306    The task of setting an appropriate time\n                    frame for an award of provisional damages is not a matter that permits\n                    precision. While the appropriate time frame should be based on medical evidence,\n                    it is not uncommon that as in the present case, the doctors themselves disagree\n                    or find it difficult to provide a specific time frame. In my view, the\n                    court’s task is to decide on a fair time frame as between the parties,\n                    taking into account the views of the doctors, as well as the interest of\n                    finality (seeTeo Ai Ling (CA)) at\n                [55]). 307    Having regard to the evidence of Dr Tan and\n                    Dr Ang, as well as the interest of finality, I find that a period of five years\n                    is an appropriate time frame. While I acknowledge that the Plaintiff may be at\n                    risk of requiring a permanent tracheostomy even after the five-year period, I am\n                    of the view that five years best strikes a balance between the Plaintiff’s\n                    need to have some protection against the eventuality that he will need a\n                    permanent tracheostomy and the Defendant’s interest in finally settling\n                    the litigation. Thus, I order that the Plaintiff may apply for future damages to\n                    be assessed if within five years of the date of my judgment, he requires a\n                    permanent tracheostomy as a result of contracting pneumonia.",
        "Future cost of Mental Capacity Act application": "308    I see no reason to disturb the AR’s\n                    award of $2,000. I agree with her assessment that the application is unlikely to\n                    be contentious. Moreover, while the Plaintiff’s counsel tried to offer\n                    evidence from the bar about the cost of hiring a lawyer and submitting an\n                    application (even a non-contentious one), no proper evidence was\n                adduced. 309    The Plaintiff’s counsel also submits\n                    that the cost of the Mental Capacity Act application will be far higher in 10\n                    years (when the Plaintiff turns 21), rendering $2,000 grossly insufficient.\n                    However, I note that an assessment of damages takes place in terms oftoday’s prices. The Plaintiff gets the $2,000\n                    today, and can choose to invest it as he will to preserve its value so that it\n                    will be sufficient to pay for the application in 10 years.",
        "Costs": "310    The AR awarded costs of $85,000 excluding\n                    disbursements. The Defendant submits that this is excessive, but offered no\n                    other grounds for its submission besides the fact that “[t]he matter went\n                    on for five days only”.[note: 21]In the circumstances, I see no\n                    reason to disturb the AR’s order of costs for the hearing\n                below."
