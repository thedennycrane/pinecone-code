        "January to March 1999": "89.        This period was the\n\nbeginning of the change over from the original plan to the revised plan.90.        On 14 March 1999, UAST\n\nproposed a \"straight lease deal\". In this proposal, Parkway would bear the DP\n\namount and the costs of demolition, construction of shell structure and interior walls\n\nbuilt to the specification of the Plaintiffs. UAST would pay a base rent fixed at $3.75\n\npsf or 18% of admission revenue, whichever was the higher.91.        On 15 March 1999, UAST\n\nsent a similar proposal with slight adjustments to occupancy and the recalculations showed\n\nthat MCST would start earning additional rental at a 26.65% occupancy rate.92.        On 23 March 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs proposed depositing a sum of $1m with the Defendants over the period of the\n\nbuilding works to demonstrate their commitment to their part of the project, which sum was\n\nto be released to the Plaintiffs once they had completed their fitting out works and\n\nopened the cinema. The $1m would be released to the Defendants in the event the Plaintiffs\n\nwere not able to finish their part of the project due to problems with financing.(AB 1172).93.\n\n        The proposals were rejected and the Plaintiffs\n\nwere told on 26 March 1999 to hand over the project to Parkway. At the same time, Parkway\n\nacknowledged the Plaintiffs’ inability to proceed under the original plan.94.        At this stage, Parkway\n\nwas in talks with Cathay as an alternative operator and had written to Cathay on 1 March\n\n1999 that PPPL would support the proposal to MCST for Cathay to be cinema operator of the\n\ncineplex.95.        The Plaintiffs were\n\nrather confused by Parkway’s letter of 26 March 1999 which coincided with a\n\nsubsequent call from someone in Parkway’s office who had wanted clarification on the\n\nrent proposal. In the result, Pacific Media asked Parkway on the same date to\"..confirm that you are still happy to entertain entering into a\n\n  lease arrangement with us under which we fit the cinema rather than construct the\n\n  shell…Obviously we would be happy to facilitate a hand-over of the shell construction\n\n  part of the project to you as soon as you would like.\"96.        On 27 March 1999, Parkway\n\ntold UAST:\" If Michael is REALLY REALISTIC & CONFIDENT of the sale of\n\n  his investment and willing to promise and do the necessary to commit in a REAL way, maybe\n\n  he and you can reconsider your lease proposal. My personal sentiments are that – in\n\n  view of the change in the proposal it will take a substantial move on Michael’s part\n\n  to persuade the Council and general body.\"(AB 1186)97.        Two days later, Pacific\n\nMedia replied:\"…I can assure you once again that we would like to complete\n\n  and operate the cinema for you. Gary will be sending you a proposal tomorrow with a\n\n  revision of the rental which we believe is fair to both parties. This will be a base rent\n\n  against a percentage of net admission revenue which will provide you with an increased\n\n  income stream dependent upon the success of the cinema. Gary has prepared these figures in\n\n  the knowledge that I am revising ouroverall proposal to include a payment to\n\n  yourselvesto cover in excess of S$3 million (sic) of the premium payable to the Land\n\n  Office.We would be prepared to contribute the sum of S$450,000 towards the\n\n  six quarterly instalments set out in the instalment scheme from the Land Office, the\n\n  first one being due on 9thSeptember 1999. These six instalments would amount\n\n  to S$2.7 million which would make out total contribution a little over S$3 million given\n\n  that we have already sent approximately S$350,000 to you….\"(AB\n\n  1187)[emphasis added]98.        The amount of DP proposed\n\nwas less than the figure of $3,465,000 under the original plan and it omitted reference to\n\ninterest. It is telling that the Defendants at no time protested or objected to a reduced\n\nDP contribution. They never sought to remind the Plaintiffs of an alleged agreement\n\nwhereby the Plaintiffs were obligated to contribute DP in the sum of $3,465,000.99.        On 30 March 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs revised their last rental proposal so as to include $3,046,900 for DP. The DP\n\nproposal was expressly stated to be based on Michael Buckley’s letter dated 29 March\n\n1999 attached to Gary Quick’s fax. This $3,046,900 included the earlier payment of\n\n$346,900 plus six quarterly instalments of $450,000 each, the first instalment commencing\n\n9 September 1999.(AB 1189).100.        With DP included in the\n\noverall package, the base rent was reduced to $2.75 psf versus 15% of net admissions\n\nrevenue, whichever was higher.101.        On the same day, Parkway\n\nreplied to the Plaintiffs. Parkway complained that it was not an improvement over the\n\nearlier proposal of $3.75 psf.(AB 1191).102.        Further to that, revised\n\nrental proposals from the Plaintiffs were sent to Parkway on 31 March 1999. This time the\n\nbase rent was increased to $3.25 psf versus 16% of net admissions revenue, whichever was\n\nthe higher. Again it was expressly stated that the base rent proposal was based \"..on\n\nUnited Artists making total payments towards the premium of S$3,046,900 [per\n\nMichael’s proposal]\".103.        Up to this stage, it is\n\nclear the Defendants had accepted and recognised that there was no binding agreement on\n\nthe Plaintiffs to pay DP. It is significant that at no time prior to this or for that\n\nmatter even after the Plaintiffs demanded repayment of $1,846,900 did the Defendants\n\nraised the existence of a concluded agreement to pay DP in the sum of either $3,465,000 or\n\n$3,046,900. At no time was there ever a request for payment of the unpaid balance DP. It\n\nwas only raised, as confirmed by Counsel for the Defendants, for the first time in the\n\nCounterclaim. These objective and cogent indications speak for themselves. The written\n\nstatements in correspondence suggest that the Defendants never believed that a contract\n\nbinding on the Plaintiffs to pay DP ever existed.",
        "Transfer of application of the project to MCST (April –May 1999)": "104.        As April 1999 commenced,\n\nParkway concentrated on the expeditious substitution of MCST in place of UAST as the named\n\napplicant of the cineplex.105.        The second 10% of DP was\n\ndue on 9 April 1999. On 8 April 1999, Parkway paid the second deposit of 10% in the sum of\n\n$906,331.50 inclusive of GST and late interest payment. In their covering letter, Parkway\n\ntold the Land Office that they would be writing to notify them of an alternative cinema\n\noperator. Parkway at the same time sought the Land Office’s support to allow a change\n\nof applicant’s name.106.        Notably, Parkway did not\n\nask the Plaintiff for their share of the DP nor did they inform them of their intention to\n\nmake payment to the Land Office. That is yet another indication that no agreement binding\n\non the Plaintiffs to pay DP existed. At this material date, the Plaintiffs have yet to\n\ntransfer the approval to PPPL or its nominees.107.        As at 30 April 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs had offered $3,046,900 towards DP as part of the overall rental package for the\n\nstraight lease arrangement. Parkway all but ignored the offer preferring to concentrate on\n\nsecuring a switch in the named applicant of the cineplex. URA had advised that since\n\nwritten permission was still valid, a change of applicant’s name would not be an\n\nissue.108.        On 5 May 1999, MCST\n\nconfirmed its willingness to consider undertaking the responsibility of being the\n\ndeveloper \"subject to terms to be agreed with UAST for the transfer of responsibility\n\nas ‘developer’ for the project\".(AB 1221). The terms\n\nof the transfer of responsibilities are set out in CPP’s letter dated 20 May 1999.\n\nSee AB 1237109.        MCST also considered the\"proposed agreements for UAST to undertake the demolition, development and\n\noperation of the 7-screen cineplex at Parkway Parade to be null and void\". UAST\n\nwas told that their \"..offer for the operation of the proposed multiplex will be\n\nconsidered a new undertaking-which is subject to contract, and to further\n\nnegotiations.\"[emphasis added]110.        On 7 May 1999, MCST\n\nrequested UAST to put forward their \"last best offer.\" UAST responded two days\n\nlater and they essentially put forward the same 31 March 1999 proposal.(AB\n\n1226).111.        On 13 May 1999, UAST\n\nagain confirmed to MCST that they would no longer be able to continue as the developer of\n\nthe cinema project. They confirmed their agreement to MCST undertaking the responsibility\n\nas developer. Gary Quick stated:\"I sincerely regret the inconvenience caused and wish to reconfirm\n\n  our commitment and continued interest in negotiating a new contract to fit-out and operate\n\n  the cinema. We are ready willing and able to proceed immediately.\"(AB 1231)112.        Following from that\n\nletter, the Plaintiffs on 19 May 1999 wrote to the Chief Planner, URA, and the consultants\n\nnamely the architects, quantity surveyors and structural engineers and informed them that\n\nMCST would take over the project as developer effective from 19 May 1999.113.        The terms of the\n\ntransfer came on 20 May 1999. CPP wrote to ALP on 20 May 1999(AB 1237):\"..We are further instructed that your clients have no objections\n\n  to our clients taking over the development of the proposed cineplex. In this regard,\n\n  please be informed that our clients are prepared to take over the development of the\n\n  proposed cineplex on the following terms and conditions:-1.    your clients shall be responsible for the\n\n  discharge of all the existing architects and other professional consultants two (2) weeks\n\n  from the date of this letter and shall bear the fees of such architects and other\n\n  consultants up to the said date of discharge. Your clients shall, at our clients’\n\n  request, furnish to our clients and/or nominees all the necessary letters of discharge of\n\n  such architects and other professional consultants within the said one-month period; and2.    your clients shall, as and when requested by our\n\n  clients, sign all required assignments, notices and documents and do all that is necessary\n\n  and expedient for the transfer to our clients and/or nominees of all your clients’\n\n  rights in respect of all applications, plans, submissions and approvals in respect of the\n\n  development of the proposed cineplex within the said two-week period; and3.    after the satisfactory taking over of the\n\n  development of the proposed cineplex by our clients and/or nominees within the said\n\n  two-week period, Parkway Properties Pte Ltd will refund to your clients (without interest)\n\n  the sum of $346,900 which was paid by your clientstowardsthe Differential\n\n  Premium; and4.    subject to all of the above, each party shall not\n\n  require from the other any reimbursement of costs and expenses (including but not limited\n\n  to administrative costs, legal costs, costs of appeal, submission fees and processing\n\n  fees) which were incurred by that party in respect of the proposed agreements and/or the\n\n  development of the proposed cineplex andthe matter shall be treated as null and void\n\n  and neither party shall have any claims against the other in respect thereof.Please let us have your confirmation on the foregoing on an urgent\n\n  basis…\"[emphasis added]114.        Here in this letter, the\n\nrefund of $346,900 was looked upon as paymenttowardsDP rather than a\n\nreimbursement of DP to Parkway. The matter was also expressly treated as null and void and\n\nneither party shall have any claims against the other in respect thereof.115.        On 21 May 1999, PPPL\n\nwrote separately to UAST to confirm that once the plans and documents have been handed\n\nover to MCST, PPPL \"will return (without deductions or interest) the $346,900 paid on\n\n14 January 1999\". Tan requested particulars of bank account to enable PPPL to effect\n\nthe telegraphic transfer.116.        Again in this letter,\n\nwhich was written by Tan, the nature of the payment of 14 January 1999 was not described\n\nas a reimbursement as it is now claimed. The Defendants were ready and wanted to return\n\nthe first payment of $346,900 to the Plaintiffs. The inference to be drawn from this is\n\nthat Parkway was willing and prepared to bear the entire DP. So far, Parkway had at that\n\nstage paid close to $1.8m to the Land Office. At that time, the application was already\n\ntransferred or in the process of being transferred to MCST.",
        "Payment of $346,900 on 14 January 1999": "117.        I will now interrupt the\n\nchronological account of the facts to deal briefly with the January 1999 payment of\n\n$346,900.118.        In my view, at the time\n\nParkway made payment of the first 10% of DP to the Land Office there was clearly no\n\nbinding agreement to contribute towards DP. At the stage of the original plan, there was\n\nmerely a provisional understanding or limited consensus which was subject to contract (as\n\nopposed to a concluded bargain) that the Plaintiffs as developer of the cineplex would\n\ncontribute $3,465,000 towards DP, PPPL a sum of $5 million and the excess, if any, to be\n\nborne by MCST.119.        Prior to Parkway paying\n\nthe first 10% of DP to the Land Office, Parkway indeed tried to bind the Plaintiffs to\n\nthis contribution. Tan wrote first on 16 April 1998(AB 732)followed by a letter dated 22 April 1998 from PPPL’s lawyers M/s Tan & Tan\n\nenclosing a Deed Of Undertaking and a Deed of Assignment for the Plaintiffs’\n\nattention.(AB 747). The Plaintiffs were required to sign and return\n\nthe confirmation to Tan’s letter of 16 April by 24 April 1998 before PPPL paid Land\n\nOffice the first 10 % of DP.120.        The Plaintiffs did not\n\nprovide the confirmation sought. ALP on 24 April 1998 told M/s Tan & Tan that they\n\nwould take clients’ instructions on the Deed of Undertaking.(AB 755).121.        Eventually, the\n\nPlaintiffs, through ALP, gave a qualified undertaking on 24 April 1998 for the payment of\n\nthe first 10% of DP. It was couched in language which only obliged the Plaintiffs to pay\n\ntheir share of the balance of the DP when the Conditional Agreement was signed. If it was\n\nnot signed by end of May 1998, the Plaintiffs would pay interest on their share of the\n\nbalance of the DP from 1stJune 1998 to date of payments of that balance.\n\nShould the Conditional Agreement not be signed at all, two scenarios would follow: the\n\nPlaintiffs would reimburse PPPL for its payment of the Plaintiffs’ share of the first\n\n10% of DP payment to the Land Office if the project ended there. But if the application,\n\nplans and drawings were assigned to PPPL, there would be no reimbursement to PPPL.(AB 756).122.        This communication is\n\nsignificant as it demonstrates that the Plaintiffs had no intention to pay DP at all if\n\nthe Defendants continued with the project and took over as developer. The refund of\n\n$346,900 contained in CPP’s letter of 20 May 1999 is consistent with this thinking.\n\nAs a term of the transfer of application to MCST, all prior arrangements on the original\n\nplan were treated as null and void and the money was agreed to be returned to the\n\nPlaintiffs. This is the clean break Parkway wanted. According to Elizabeth’s internal\n\nmemo, she received legal advice to \"terminate UA early – to avoid\n\n‘misleading’ them\". See AB 1168123.        Tan’s oral\n\ntestimony(NE 586)that it is \"beyond doubt that if they [the\n\nPlaintiffs] had not committed, we would not have paid the DP in April 1998\" is\n\ncontradicted by the contemporaneous documents.124.        On 13 January 1999,\n\nPacific Media remitted $346,900 to PPPL. This remittance was not pursuant to the qualified\n\nundertaking given in April 1998. Quick in 165 of his affidavit of evidence-in- chief\n\nsaid that he and Michael Buckley had dinner with Parkway’s representative on 5\n\nJanuary 1999. Over dinner, Parkway sought to pressure the Plaintiffs into making some sort\n\nof initial or advance payment towards the intended project. In his written testimony,\n\nQuick said that the January 1999 remittance was an advance payment. From the evidence, it\n\nappears that Quick, had during cross-examination, mistakenly agreed with Counsel for the\n\nDefendants that the payment was a reimbursement to the Defendants rather than an advance\n\npayment. Thus, contrary to the submission of the Defendants, the payment of $346,900 in\n\nJanuary 1999 did not discharge any debt owing to PPPL. There was no debt at all in the\n\nfirst place to speak of.125.        Even if the January\n\nremittance was meant to reimburse PPPL the Plaintiffs’ share of the first 10% of DP\n\npaid at the request of the Plaintiffs and on their behalf, the status of this payment\n\nchanged following the Defendants’ agreement to refund the money in May 1999.126.        The Defendants’\n\npleaded case is that there was an agreement by the 2ndPlaintiffs to contribute\n\nDP. This agreement, according to the Defendants, was reached either in 1996 or in January\n\n1999. The negotiations under the original plan were subject to contract and the payment of\n\nDP was a term of the Conditional Agreement that was never finalised and signed. Neither\n\nwas the Deed of Undertaking finalised and signed. Further, exchanges of correspondence do\n\nnot show any concluded agreement to pay DP in the sum of $3,465,000. Definitely by end May\n\n1999, any possible or arguable hint of an agreement to pay DP had been treated as null and\n\nvoid.127.        ALP on 16 July 1999 had\n\nwritten for the $346,900 to be returned to Pacific Media. The money was to be returned on\n\nthe basis of a clean break.(AB 1301). However, there was no purpose\n\nsubsequently in pressing for its return since the Plaintiffs wanted to remain as the\n\noperator of the cineplex under the revised plan. In my view, the Plaintiffs left the\n\nJanuary 1999 payment with the Defendants as part of the $1m good faith deposit offered by\n\nPacific Media under the revised plan.128.        As Gary Quick said, the\n\nrefund was \"rolled into the new proposal\" (NE 71). It was\n\npart of the overall package and as it was already in the Defendants’ hand it was\n\nincorporated as part of the good faith deposit in July 1999.129.        I now return to the\n\nhistory of events in June - September 1999.",
        "June – September 1999": "130.        Earlier in the month on\n\n9 June 1999, DPM had sent to Council Members the offers from both UAST and Cathay. After\n\nCouncil Members met on 16 June, a decision was made to request financial commitment on\n\nperformance from the respective operators. This would allow Council Members to endorse the\n\nparty to be selected as cinema operator. At that time, the sale of Pacific Media’s\n\ninternet business was not yet completed. The latter had on 9 June, requested PPPL to\n\npostpone giving \"this contract to any other party until after 30 June\" which was\n\nwhen the announcement of the sale and purchase of Pacific Media’s internet business\n\nwas expected.131.        According to draft\n\nminutes of Council Meeting held on 16 June 1999, whilst Pacific Media was not ready,\n\nCathay was \"ready to commit to an offer of the lease for the operation of the\n\ncineplex based on the terms submitted in the table at Appendix 2.\" Also\n\n\"Cathay..had expressed that they are ready to sign the lease agreement if the\n\nmanagement council can accept their terms.\" See AB 1285.132.        Tan, in his oral\n\ntestimony, confirmed that in June 1999, Cathay was the only party with whom the Defendants\n\nwere still talking to. By this time, the Defendants had made payment of the second 10%\n\ninstalment of DP to the Land Office in April 1999 without calling upon the Plaintiffs to\n\ncontribute their share unlike previously with the first payment. Also by this time, MCST\n\nhad taken over as developer of the project. These are objective indications consistent\n\nwith there being no binding agreement between the Plaintiffs and the Defendants to\n\ncontribute towards DP in the sum of $3,465,000 or $3,046,900.133.        Earlier in the month,\n\nURA was told on 8 June 1999 that MCST had taken over as named applicant developer from\n\nUAST. MCST also alluded that it was considering the project with another party who will\n\nrequire an amendment to the proposed layout submitted by UAST. The proposed layout was\n\n10-15% smaller than the approved layout. In view of this, MCST was seeking an adjustment\n\nto the amount of DP. On 16 June 1999, MCST wrote a similar letter to Land Office for\n\nadjustment of the DP.134.        Parkway responded to the\n\nPlaintiffs’ offer of 9 May 1999 on 21 June. The language used by Parkway was\n\ndeliberate with the intention to start afresh their relationship and re-negotiate. Not\n\nonly was the subject matter headed \" Interest to lease and operate the proposed\n\ncineplex at Parkway Parade\", the letter was marked \"Without Prejudice &\n\nSubject to Contract\". Parkway advised the Plaintiffs that whilst their offer to lease\n\nand operate the proposed cineplex was being reviewed by Management Council, the latter\n\nhad:\"…requested .. an undertaking from your organization - as a\n\n  form of financial commitment during this period of finalisation of the proposed leased\n\n  terms and conditions.The form of financial commitment may be in a confirmation of your\n\n  financial status to commit to the proposed project with a reference from your bank and\n\n  with a \"performance guarantee\".We appreciate if you would revert by 30 June 1999 on the above to\n\n  demonstrate your ability to undertake the proposed project.\"(AB 1265)135.        The Plaintiffs were not\n\nwilling or able to provide a banker’s performance bond. On 25 June 1999, the\n\nPlaintiffs instead proposed other means of security (AB 1271):As a gesture of good faith we would be prepared todeposit\n\n  with you the sum of $500,000 which would be forfeited should we fail to complete the\n\n  project.This offer is madewithout prejudice and subject to contractexpressly\n\n  on the understanding that it would be available to us to complete the contract and would\n\n  not be held by you once the Cineplex had commenced operations.\"[emphasis added]136.        There was continual\n\ndoubt in the Defendants’ minds over the Plaintiffs’ ability to carry through\n\nwith the project since the proceeds of disposal of the internet business were not\n\nearmarked for the project and furthermore Pacific Media was going on a fund raising\n\nexercise for US$25 m.137.        On 13 July 1999, Pacific\n\nMedia told Parkway that they were confident of their financial ability to complete the\n\nproject so much so that they would be prepared to place a deposit with Parkway on the\n\nfollowing terms:\"I believe that you currently have adeposit from us of\n\n  S$345,000towards the premium payable to the Land Office. I would be happy to give you\n\n  a further deposit of $500,000 upon signing a lease making a total of $845,000. This money\n\n  would be used as a final payment of our portion of the premium but the whole amount of\n\n  S$845,000 would be released to your company as a penalty payment if we were unable to\n\n  complete the construction of the cinema successfully. Whilst I would expect the interest\n\n  accruing on this money to be paid to us on an agreed time scale, this interest would also\n\n  be waived in the event of non-completion which means that you would receive a penalty\n\n  payment of close to S$1 m if we did not fulfil our part of the contract.I am sure that you will agreethis proposal is a significant gesture\n\n  of good faithregarding our intentions and our ability to complete the project. …\n\n  I suggest that we now ask our respective lawyers to prepare a new lease for signature in\n\n  the very near future. I will be in Singapore next week and would be happy to meet you to\n\n  finalise any outstanding points and to sign the lease if it can be prepared within that\n\n  time scale..\" (AB 1298)[emphasis added]138.        It is quite clear from\n\nthis letter that the intended purpose was for the $346,900 to form part of the good faith\n\ndeposit which was supplemented by an \"additional deposit\" of $500,000.139.        Parkway viewed this\n\nproposal as minuscule. There is a handwritten note with the comment that $1m was\n\n\"peanuts\".(AB 1299).140.        Pacific Media increased\n\nthe amount of the \"additional\" good faith deposit from $500,000 to $600,000 on\n\n20 July 1999:\"I feel that the offer contained in my letter of 13thJuly to Elizabeth Soh regarding theadditional depositof $500,000 which we are\n\n  prepared to place with you together with the support of this existing cash flow should be\n\n  sufficient for you to execute the lease with us. As a final gesture of goodwill I am\n\n  prepared toincrease the additional deposit from $500,000 to $600,000 in the hope that\n\n  we can now execute the lease and proceed with our joint development.\"(AB 1303)[emphasis added]141.        At this stage, the total\n\ngood faith deposit came up to $946,500 (i.e. $346,900 plus $600,000).142.        The proposal of 20 July\n\nwas revised again three days later. This time the Plaintiffs proposed a corporate\n\nguarantee from Pacific Media to secure the performance of the lease by UAST. The lease\n\nwould be in the name of UAST:\"In order to resolve this long standing situation I am now\n\n  prepared to send you a letter from Pacific Media guaranteeing the obligations of UASTif\n\n  that company enters into a lease with you to construct and operate the proposed multiplexas a substitute for all previous offers of financial assistance.You will understand that I am prepared to do this in the belief\n\n  that the funding of this development will not present any difficulties…I suggest that we now proceed to sign the lease once it has been\n\n  amended to reflect the latest agreed proposals between us and I see no reason why this\n\n  could not be achieved before the end of next week.I hope that this proposal is\n\n  acceptable, being much more substantial than all previous offers of support.\"(AB 1310)[emphasis added]143.        The proposal was not\n\nacceptable to Parkway. Pacific Media on 26 July wrote to Tan of PPPL:\" As I explained to the[Council] meeting, we are basically putting\n\n  all of the Group resources behind this project in that the lease will taken in the name of\n\n  UAST and I will write a letter from this company guaranteeing their obligations.

This proposal made\n\nminor adjustment to their last proposal of 31 March 1999(AB 1193).\n\nThe percentage of net admissions revenue upon which the minimum base rent was to be\n\ncalculated was increased from 16 % to 18%.

A reminder was sent on 3 September . The letter requested \"payment to allow us\n\nto facilitate payment to Land Office\".153.        On the same day, Pacific\n\nMedia confirmed that the money would be sent by 9 September. The money was remitted on 9\n\nSeptember 1999. The next payment of $450,000 was remitted on 15 December 1999. In the\n\nPlaintiffs’ bank application for remittance of the various payments to PPPL, the\n\nwords \"Differential Premium\" was written in the box \"Details to be notified\n\nto beneficiary\".154.        The contemporaneous\n\ndocuments showed that PPPL, meanwhile, had intended to pay the balance of the DP to the\n\nLand Office in full. Elizabeth said that she spoke to Michael Buckley and Quick about\n\nthis. This oral testimony is not in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief nor recorded in any\n\nof the contemporaneous documents. In  289 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Quick\n\nstated that the Plaintiffs were not informed of and were completely unaware about\n\nParkway’s full payment of the balance of DP on 9 September 1999. Under\n\ncross-examination, he said he did not recall having this conversation.155.        Earlier, Parkway had on\n\n7 September 1999 asked the Land Office for waiver of interest on the basis that full\n\npayment of the balance 80% of DP would be paid by 10 September 1999.156.        On 9 September 1999,\n\nParkway paid the remaining 80% of DP plus GST. After that, Land Office reverted with its\n\ndecision not to waive interest. The Defendants paid interest on 31 December 1999.157.        In my view, that\n\nDefendants took themselves out of the instalment plan and paid the remaining 80% of DP in\n\nfull in order to improve their chances of securing a waiver of interest charge from the\n\nLand Office.(3) Findings and Decision(i) Intention and Purpose behind the Four Payments158.        The Plaintiffs’\n\ncontention is that the various payments were made (i) in the course of negotiations for\n\nthe intended lease;(ii) with a view to securing and/or in consideration of the intended\n\nlease; and/or (iii) to account of their anticipated obligations under the intended lease.\n\nThe Plaintiffs submitted that the payments were advances made in good faith to evidence\n\ntheir sincerity and commitment to the project and on the assumption that the intended\n\nlease agreement was going to be finalised and executed in due course. The Plaintiffs\n\nrelied onChillingworth v EscheandGoff & Jones: TheLaw of\n\nRestitution (5thed.)pp 43 and 665 in support of their claim.159.        The Defendants’\n\nsubmission is that the payments were remitted as non-refundable DP for the Land Office.\n\nThe 1stDefendants had paid DP to the Land Office at the Plaintiffs’\n\nrequest and the four payments were meant to reimburse the 1stDefendants for\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ share of their contribution towards DP payment, which had been agreed\n\nat either $3.465 m or $3.046 m.160.        Since I have decided\n\nthat there was no concluded free-standing agreement binding on the Plaintiffs to\n\ncontribute towards DP, the primary contention of the Defendants falls away.161.        Quick’s oral\n\nevidence is that the Plaintiffs need not have to pay DP to the Land Office. By July/August\n\n1999, the Plaintiffs were no longer developer of the project. MCST had taken over from\n\nthem.162.        Quick’s testimony\n\nis that DP under the straight lease arrangement was part of the overall offer. (NE 77).\n\nPacific Media’s letter dated 29 March 1999 expressly stated that the Plaintiffs have\n\nincluded contribution of DP as part of the Plaintiffs’overall proposalto fit\n\nout and operate the cineplex. The offer to contribute DP was a sweetener to enhance their\n\noverall package to make it more attractive to the Defendants. (NE 54,57,59).163.        The Defendants certainly\n\nviewed the DP contribution of $3.046m to be an integral part of the rental package. An\n\nillustration of this is from the Defendants’ comparison of the offer from Cathay with\n\nthe Plaintiffs’. In the computation of net rental income of the Plaintiffs’\n\noffer, the benefit of the DP contribution was amortised over different projected lease\n\nperiods and matched to their respective rental income streams.164.        The Plaintiffs’\n\noffer was more financially attractive than Cathay’s.A contribution by the Plaintiffs towards DP in their proposal was\n\nimportant to the Defendants as it reduces the upfront costs needed for the cineplex\n\nproject and hence reduces the overall funding requirements of the project. In the event\n\nthat Cathay was chosen as the cinema operator, borrowings for the project would have been\n\na net $2,531,900 more resulting in a higher interest bill. Further, the full repayment of\n\nthe borrowings would be stretched by a further six years from year 2013 (based on\n\nUAST’s offer) to year 2019 (based on Cathay’s offer). SeeAB\n\n1319-1324.165.        Yet the Defendants\n\nwanted tangible assurance from the Plaintiffs of their commitment and financial ability to\n\ndo the deal. Cathay’s financial standing was acceptable to the Defendants but not\n\ntheir offer.166.        Parkway told URA on 22\n\nJune 1999: \"[W]e are in the process of determining the financial standing of each\n\nparty to enable MCST to make a prudent decision so as to allow us to proceed on the\n\nproject.\"167.        It is clear that in June\n\n1999, the Plaintiffs turned down Parkway’s request that a performance bond from a\n\nbank be provided. Other options were then offered in a series of communications that ended\n\nwith the undertakings from the Plaintiffs on 28 July 1999.168.        An examination of all\n\nthe circumstances gathered mainly from the contemporaneous documents showed what the\n\nparties were about. In fact, they showed that the payments were made in response to the\n\nattitude of the Defendants which at that time was one of serious concern as to whether the\n\nPlaintiffs would financially be in a position to see through and hold up to their end of\n\nthe bargain after the lease of the cineplex was awarded to them. At that time, the shell\n\nstructure had yet to be constructed.169.        InGuardian Ocean\n\nCargoes Ltd & Ors v Banco do Brasil SA[1991] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 68, the same\n\ninquiry as in the present case was before Hirst J, namely, the purpose and intent of the\n\npayments made before contract. There the plaintiffs recovered judgment for repayment of\n\nUS$600,000 deposited with the defendant bank as a token of good faith in a proposed\n\nshipbuilding re-financing deal in which negotiations broke down after 5 years. The prima\n\nfacie rule on pre-contract deposits was not rebutted and the plaintiffs inGuardian\n\nOcean,asinChillingworth v Eschesucceeded in recovering the money\n\nback.170.        InGuardian Ocean,\n\nthe object of the negotiations was for the plaintiffs (who had demise chartered the\n\n\"Golden Med\") to take over the responsibilities of the owners who had defaulted\n\non the shipbuilding contract and loan from the bank, and for the transaction to be\n\nrefinanced by the defendant bank.171.        Negotiations were\n\nprotracted and spread over a five-year period. Draft contracts were produced but revised\n\ndue to constant changes to proposals as the value of the vessel dropped in a deteriorating\n\nshipping market. During the five years, the plaintiffs traded the vessel commercially.\n\nRelations broke down with the bank’s arrest of the vessel. In the end, no contract\n\nwas ever entered into between the bank and the plaintiffs.172.        The plaintiffs argued\n\nthat the money was deposited with the bank as a token of genuine intent for future use in\n\nthe intended acquisition by the plaintiffs of the vessel \"Golden Med\" and was\n\nonly to be applied by the bank for that purpose if negotiations between the plaintiff and\n\nbank for the refinancing of the vessel were successful; the remittance were conditional on\n\nthe conclusion of the financing deal.173.        The original proposal\n\nfor the 3 remittances emanated from Mr. Juchem who was the in-house lawyer of the shipyard\n\nin order to give [like in the present case] a tangible assurance to the bank that the\n\nplaintiffs were financially sound, and that they were serious in their intent to take over\n\nthe shipbuilding contract. In his written testimony, he said the payments were intended to\n\nshow good faith on the part of the buyers (the plaintiffs) and to help influence the bank\n\nto grant the loan. Once made it should be possible to convince the bank that their loan\n\nwould be repaid. The goodwill payments would show the bank that the \"Golden Med\"\n\nwas really up to date again, and help influence them to go ahead and loan the remainder of\n\nthe required funds. He went on to testify that knowing the bank, it was important that a\n\nprospective new borrower should show a willingness to make a substantial payment on\n\naccount and as a sign of goodwill before concluding the deal. The importance and\n\nsignificance of the plaintiffs making a goodwill payment totalling US$600,000 must be\n\nviewed against the attitude of the bank. (p81)174.        Mr. Juchem said that\n\neveryone expected the deal to go through and the money applied to the promissory notes,\n\nbut everything was meant to be dependent on the refinancing being secured. The intention\n\nwas to make a deposit not a payment, and the money would be set against the promissory\n\nnote debt when the final refinancing documents were signed. (p81)175.        Mr. Petropoulos for the\n\nplaintiffs testified that he made it clear that his prime concern in entering the\n\nnegotiations for refinancing was to minimize his losses and safeguard the investment he\n\nhad already made in two vessels. He said that the goodwill payments were to convince the\n\nbank of the company’s sincerity, and to be applied towards the purchase price if the\n\nrefinancing went through; he never considered making an outright payment. (p82)176.        The bank’s position\n\non the other hand, was that the remittances were outright payments.177.        It is the bank’s\n\ncase that prior to the first remittance of US$200,000 the scheme was fundamentally changed\n\nand that instead of mere conditional deposits, outright payments were proposed to be made\n\nby the plaintiffs on behalf of Timber Point for the credit of the yard in payment of the\n\ndishonoured promissory notes. The bank contended that these were voluntary payments made\n\nunconditionally and therefore irrecoverable by the plaintiffs.178.        Hirst J considered the\n\nsame question as inChillingworth v Esche, namely, was it intended that the\n\npayments should pass outright and irrevocably to the bank whatever the outcome of the\n\nnegotiations or only if those negotiations resulted in a concluded refinancing.179.        The bank argued that the\n\nevidence of Mr. Juchem and Mr. Petropoulos did not support the plaintiffs’ case of a\n\nconditional payment. Hirst J did not agree with the bank’s analysis of the evidence.\n\nHirst J said that \" ..when Mr. Juchem referred in [his written statement] to\n\n\"goodwill payment\", \"payments for a specific purpose\", \"payments\n\nas a sign of good faith\" and the like, he was intending to refer to the payments\n\nbeing conditional [i.e contingent upon the conclusion of a refinancing deal].\" (p.\n\n83)180.        The importance and\n\nsignificance of Mr. Petropoulos making a goodwill payment of US$600,00 must be viewed\n\nagainst the attitude of the bank [in the same way as the Defendants’ concern here\n\nabout the financial ability of the Plaintiffs].181.        Quick’s testimony\n\nis that he had no reason to doubt that a lease would not be signed. Even though the\n\nnegotiations had been conducted \"subject to contract\", the parties to this\n\naction had been discussing the cineplex project for so long that both parties had\n\nconfidently expected a formal contract to eventuate.182.        The payments were\n\n\"inextricably linked\" and made in anticipation of the intended lease. ( 270.20\n\nof Quick’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief; NE 66). The sum of $346,900 was held by\n\nthe Defendants to account of future liability under the intended lease. See ( 270.22 of\n\nQuick’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief.)183.        After 6 August 1999,\n\nthere were negotiations on what would happen to the DP contribution of $3.046m in the\n\nevent of default of performance of the executed lease. To illustrate, there were\n\nnegotiations on a refund of the $3.046m if MCST was not able to hand over the shell\n\nstructure by 28 February 2001 to the Plaintiffs to fit out and there were negotiations on\n\nthe future use of the $600,000 such as applying the money to the instalment payments.\n\nThere was even a proposal on 4 October 1999 to utilise part of the $600,000 towards the\n\nrental deposit which is equal to three months’ base rent required under the draft\n\nlease and the balance applied towards the last instalment payment of $450,000 due on 9\n\nDecember 2000.184.        Quick’s evidence is\n\nthat there was no reason to make the payments except for the lease. Without the lease,\n\nthere was no reason for the Plaintiffs to contribute towards DP. Elizabeth and Tan\n\naccepted that. They also agreed that the Land Office’s approval obtained from payment\n\nof DP would be meaningless to the Plaintiffs without a lease from MCST. (NE 391,169 and\n\n545).185.        The statements in the\n\ndocumented evidence referred to \"gesture of good faith\", \"good faith\n\npayment\", \"good faith deposit\", ‘deposit\", ‘additional\n\ndeposit\" and \"additional good faith deposit\". Quick disagreed with Counsel\n\nfor the Defendants who suggested in a question put to him that the four payments were not\n\ndeposits or advances.186.        A significant feature of\n\nthe present case is that the Defendants had asked the Plaintiffs for tangible assurance of\n\ntheir financial ability to undertake and complete the revised plan. I would characterise\n\nthe four payments as pre-contract deposits which served as an indication of the\n\nPlaintiffs’ confidence with funding, genuine interest and seriousness in being the\n\ncinema operator of the cineplex at Parkway Parade. The four payments were deposited with\n\nthe Defendants as tangible assurance of genuine intent. In my view, the four payments were\n\nto be kept aside and held against the conclusion of a final lease and for use of the money\n\ndeposited after the lease was signed.187.        I accept the\n\nPlaintiffs’ evidence that the payments were made in anticipation of the lease. They\n\nwere not intended to be outright payments. There was no commercial reason for the\n\nPlaintiffs to pay $1.8m, which is not an insignificant amount of money as non-refundable\n\nDP without or regardless of a signed lease. The Plaintiffs needed a long lease to recoup\n\ntheir investment. Quick’s evidence that the Plaintiffs paid because they thought they\n\nwould get a lease, is clear indication that they never intended to make outright payments\n\nequivalent to gifts.188.        Tan (NE 616) accepted\n\nCounsel’s suggestion put to him that \"the [various] payments were [made]to\n\naccountof Plaintiffs’ obligation to MCST under the intended lease\n\narrangement.\" [emphasis added] In other words, the payments were to be used to fulfil\n\nthe terms of the lease if and when that is executed.189.        The DP contribution to\n\nMCST is reflected in the draft lease and is an obligation that only arises if the lease\n\nwas signed. The six quarterly instalments in Clause 4 of the working draft lease followed\n\nthe timetable for payment to the Land Office. The same schedule was used as a matter of\n\nconvenience. If indeed the money from the Plaintiffs were meant to pay the Land Office,\n\nthe date of instalment payment would have been a couple of days earlier than the due date\n\nof payment to the Land Office. The obligation to pay DP under the intended lease was to\n\nMCST and not PPPL.190.        The Plaintiffs had\n\nexpected the lease to be executed before any of the six instalments began. But\n\nnegotiations on the terms of the intended lease were still on-going at the time Parkway\n\nsent reminders to the Plaintiffs to pay. It is evident that the Plaintiffs remitted the\n\npayments in September and December 1999 of $450,000 each as good faith pre-contract\n\ndeposits.191.        The good faith payment\n\nwas recorded in ALP’s letter of 26 November 1999 which commented on Clause 3.12 of\n\nthe working draft lease and CPP’s note to the clause. Clause 3.12 deals with the\n\nconsequence of MCST’s inability to give UAST access to the shell structure after 28\n\nFebruary 2001 for fitting out works. In the event, the tenant may rescind the lease. The\n\nonly refund that was provided was the lease deposit of three months. ALP said: \" [W]e\n\nare of the firm view that our client’s continuing contribution towards the DP in good\n\nfaith must be refunded if your clients are unable to hand over the premises to our clients\n\nfor the fitting out works by the agreed date\".192.        It is clear from the\n\ncorrespondence that the remittance of $600,000 as well as the earlier sum of $346,900 were\n\nto be treated together as a good faith pre-contract deposit.193.        The $346,900 was already in hand. The\n\nPlaintiffs remitted $600,000 in July 1999. From the correspondence, the $346,900 and\n\n$600,000 were referred to as the \"deposit\" and \"additional deposit\"\n\nrespectively. The $600,000 was referred to by Elizabeth as a \"holding deposit\"\n\nfor the landlord. A \"holding deposit\" is a term used to describe pre-contract\n\ndeposits. It is generally paid by a \"prospective purchaser\" or \"prospective\n\nlessor\" such as in the case of the Plaintiffs who had made the payment subject to\n\ncontract. SeeSydney Harbour Casino Holdings v NMBE Pty Ltd(1999) 9 BPR 16,679 at\n\np16,687.194.        The $600,000 was\n\ntransferred to MCST’s bank account on 3 August 1999 where it was kept for sometime.\n\nThe transfer of the money back to PPPL by journal entry in February 2000 was between PPPL\n\nand MCST. That accounting entry does not in my view change the purpose and intention of\n\nthe payment as between the Plaintiffs and Defendants.195.        I find, on the evidence,\n\nthat the four payments, namely, the sum of $346,900, $600,000 and each of the $450,000\n\nremittances were pre-contract deposits. In the case of the $346,900 remitted in January\n\n1999 it was subsequently agreed in May 1999 to be refunded to the Plaintiffs. By\n\nJuly/August 1999, the Plaintiffs permitted it to be retained by the Defendants as part of\n\ngood faith deposit.(ii) The terms, if any, upon which the payments were made196.        I now consider the\n\nterms, if any, upon which the four payments were made. Were they to be non-refundable in\n\nthe event the lease was not signed? Where there is no contract and in the absence of any\n\nexpress term governing the pre-contract deposit to the contrary, the prima facie rule is\n\nthat the money is to be returned to the Plaintiffs.197.        The Defendants’\n\ncontention is that the Plaintiffs knew that DP paid to the Land Office was not refundable.\n\nThat may be so. But in this case, the question is whether or not the Plaintiffs paid the\n\nmoney on the basis that it would be non-refundable if the parties failed to execute a\n\nlease for the cineplex and not whether the Plaintiffs knew that DP paid to the Land Office\n\nwas non-refundable.198.Sydney Harbour Casino\n\nHoldings Ltd v NMBE Pty Limited, is a case where the parties had agreed that the\n\ndeposit should be returned if a lease was signed but not otherwise. The Court of Appeal\n\nheld that as a matter of construction, it is not possible to imply from that express\n\nprovision the converse situation whereby the payee is to retain the deposit if no lease\n\nwas entered it.199.        In that case the\n\nappellant Sydney Harbour Casino Holdings Ltd (\"SHCH\") wanted to lease the\n\npremises from the respondent NMBE. In negotiating the lease agreement, SHCH paid a\n\n\"holding deposit\" to the respondent pending completion of the formal document.\n\nThe appellant found cheaper premises and decided not to proceed with the lease. SHCH sued\n\nfor repayment of the amount paid.200.        Before Rolfe J, NMBE\n\nsubmitted that if NMBE failed in establishing a binding contract for the lease of the\n\npremises had been entered into, SHCH might still not succeed in recovering the $300,000.\n\nSHCH’s evidence showed that the $300,000 was paid by it to NMBE in consideration for\n\nNMBE not negotiating with other prospective lessees whilst it was negotiating with SHCH,\n\nand that the only basis upon which SHCH was entitled to recover it was if a binding\n\nagreement was entered into. The agreement was subject to the condition that the $300,000\n\nwould be refundable upon the execution of the lease. This line of argument did not find\n\nfavour at the appellate level. The parties’ mind were directed to what was to happen\n\nif the lease was executed. Nothing was said about what was to happen in the event that the\n\nnegotiations did not end with execution of a lease.201.        In that circumstance,\n\nthe appellate court held: \" …where neither party had directed their minds to\n\nwhat would happen if an executed lease did not eventuate, no express agreement could be\n\ninferred as to what would happen in this event. In this situation it is necessary to have\n\nrecourse to the law relating to pre-contract deposits.\"202.        On appeal, it was held\n\nthat NMBE had no right to keep the deposit because a pre-contract deposit is prima facie\n\nrecoverable if the prospective contract it is connected with does not come into existence.203.Gribbon v Lutton[2002] 2 WLR 842, is a case where the parties had stipulated as to what is to happen to\n\nthe deposit if no contract is signed. On the facts, the Court of Appeal held the\n\nsolicitors were negligent in failing to secure an enforceable bipartite agreement under\n\nwhich the deposit would have been forfeited had the purchaser failed to purchase the land.\n\nThe Court of Appeal recognised that the vendor’s claim to the money could be enforced\n\nnot because he had given consideration for the promise but because he has imposed a burden\n\non the purchaser by stipulating that the deposit was non-refundable should there be no\n\nconcluded contract.204.        As to what to do with\n\nthe $1,846,900 paid if the lease was not signed, I find that the parties here were silent\n\nboth orally and in writing. I agree with the Court of Appeal inSydney Harbourthat\n\nthe inference to be drawn from the parties’ \"consequent silence in their\n\n..writings and words on the question what would happen to the deposit in the event no\n\nlease was executed\" is that \"they made no express agreement at all about what\n\nwould happen in that event.\" Once that stage in the analysis of the evidence is\n\nreached, the issue is to be determined in accordance with the law on pre-contract\n\ndeposits. On this approach, the money is to be returned to the Plaintiffs. In my judgment,\n\nthe Defendants have not displaced the prima facie rule to show a right to retain the\n\npre-contract payments.205.        The Defendants argued\n\nthat the Plaintiffs had assumed the risk of their payments where the parties were\n\nnegotiating on a \"subject to contract\" basis and everybody knows that there is a\n\nrisk that at the end of the day, either side may back out if the negotiations before a\n\ncontract is executed.Given my findings, this argument also\n\nfails.206.        The negotiations were\n\n\"subject to contract\". The phrase \"subject to contract\" means, as\n\nmatter of construction, that the four payments were conditional on the conclusion and\n\nexecution of the lease. The only consideration for the payment was the making of that\n\ncontract. Without a signed lease, the consideration for the payments fails. On the\n\nevidence, applying the law relating to pre-contract deposits, the Plaintiffs are entitled\n\nto recover the total sum of $1,846,900 on the ground of total failure of consideration.207.        It is evident from the\n\ndocumented evidence that PPPL was representing MCST in the negotiations in respect of the\n\nproposed cineplex project. Elizabeth reported to and took instructions from Tan. I\n\ntherefore find that PPPL was at all material times the agent for MCST.208.        Both Defendants are\n\nliable to repay $1,846,900 to the Plaintiffs. The money was remitted to PPPL and received\n\nby PPPL as agent of the prospective lessor, MCST. The intended lease between 1stPlaintiffs and 2ndDefendants did not materialise. In the circumstances, both\n\nare liable to repay the sum of $1,846,900. SeeGribbon v Lutton[2002] 2 WLR 842 at\n\n843.(4) The Defendants’ submissions on the claim in restitution209.        The Defendants’\n\ncontention for declining to return the money was based on the alleged ground that there\n\nwas an agreement to contributetowards DP and the monies were paid to the Land\n\nOffice as part of the Plaintiffs’ share of the contribution. They were to reimburse\n\nPPPL for payment of DP made on behalf of the Plaintiffs at their request. These arguments\n\nfall on the way side as there is no free-standing contract to contribute towards DP. I\n\nhave also found that the total sum of $1,846,900 was not paid on terms that if no lease\n\nwere executed, the money would irrevocably pass to and be retained by the Defendants.210.        Counsel for the\n\nDefendants further submitted that the payments were made in exchange for an opportunity to\n\nnegotiate the terms of the lease. The payments were for a confirmed offer of the proposed\n\ncineplex. The Defendants argued that the words \"confirmed offer of a lease\" in\n\nParkway’s letter dated 28 July 1998 comprised an opportunity or chance to negotiate\n\nthe terms of a lease. There was therefore consideration for the payment.211.        In support of this\n\nargument, Counsel relied on Tan’s oral testimony of Tan (NE 546):\"…DP is payable when approval [was obtained] from [the]\n\n  authorities. For all intents and purposes [a] lease should have been struck at that time.\n\n  In order to secure the right to stay in the deal a payment has to be made. Would say DP\n\n  has to be paid in order to stay in [the] game for negotiations….\"212.        This oral testimony is\n\nnot stated in Tan’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief. Neither is it in Elizabeth’s\n\naffidavit. In fact, she repeatedly denied during cross-examination that the payments were\n\nfor a confirmed offer from Parkway.213.        The Plaintiffs’\n\ncontention is that the \"opportunity to negotiate\" argument was not pleaded. The\n\nDefendants disagreed and said that their argument is consistent with their pleaded case\n\nthat failure of consideration was partial. I agree with the Plaintiffs on the pleadings\n\npoint. The constituent facts making up a plea of partial consideration must be pleaded.214.        In any event, the\n\nDefendants’ argument is really nothing more than a promise to negotiate or continue\n\nto negotiate a lease agreement subject to contract. This is not consideration recognised\n\nby law. An arrangement or agreement whereby the parties agree to negotiate in the future\n\nwill not be enforced on the ground that the agreement is incomplete, uncertain or is not\n\nsupported by consideration. Accordingly the law does not recognise as an enforceable\n\ncontract, an agreement to agree or negotiate a contract:Courtney and Fairbairn Ltd v\n\nTolainiBros(Hotels) Ltd[1975] 1 WLR 297;Mallozzi v Carapelli SpA(1976) 1 Lloyd’s Rep 407;Walford v Miles[1992] AC 128.215.        The Defendants submitted\n\nthat Plaintiffs’ claim for restitution is based upon the doctrine of unjust\n\nenrichment. It is not disputed that the underlying principle of an action for money had\n\nand receive is unjust enrichment.216.        All three elements of\n\nunjust enrichment- benefit, at the plaintiffs’ expense and unjust\n\n\"factor\"-are undoubtedly present on an analysis of the payments based upon the\n\ndoctrine of unjust enrichment.217.        Here the payments were\n\nmade while negotiations were ‘subject to contract’ and the deal failed to\n\nmaterialise. Given the conclusions reached in this judgment, the Defendants have no right\n\nto retain the money. Since they cannot retain the money, they are unjustly enriched.Other Issues218.        There is no need to deal\n\nwith the other alternative issues, which will only arise if I reached the opposite\n\nconclusion on the central issue.219.        Given my findings, the\n\nfacts in evidence fall short of satisfying the elements of the defence of change of\n\nposition.Conclusion220.        There be judgment for\n\nthe Plaintiffs against the Defendants in the sum of $1,846,900 with interest thereon at 6%\n\nper annum from the date of the writ to date of Judgment and costs.221.        As a corollary to this\n\ndecision in favour of the Plaintiffs, the 1stDefendants’ Counterclaim is\n\ntherefore dismissed with costs.Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
