        "The background": "4\n\n        In the amended Originating Summons the claim is\n\nfor the following reliefs:-(i)    a declaration that the\n\n    defendants shall not be entitled to call or demand payment or otherwise receive payment in\n\n    respect of the Bond and Advance Payment Guarantees until the final outcome of the\n\n    arbitration proceedings; and(ii)    the defendants be\n\n    restrained from taking any steps to demand or receive payment under the said Bond and\n\n    Advance Payment Guarantees or otherwise receiving, encumbering or otherwise dealing with\n\n    the monies or any part thereof under the Bond and Advance Payment Guarantees.5\n\n        The Bond was issued by American Home Assurance\n\nCompany (\"AHA\"), a corporation of the State of New York, out of their branch\n\noffice in Singapore to secure its performance of a sub-contract which I will describe\n\nlater. The Bond expressly stated that it was \"made in accordance with the laws of\n\nSingapore andsubject to the decision of the courts of Singapore\". (emphasis\n\nadded). The Advance Payment Guarantee of 20 March 2001, which was also furnished by AHA,\n\nalso expressly provided thus: \"This Guarantee is made in accordance with the laws of\n\nSingapore andsubject to the decision of the Courts of Singapore\".As security\n\nfor AHA, the plaintiffs, a Singapore company, had in turn signed counter-indemnities in\n\nfavour of AHA.6\n\n        The purpose of the Bond and Advance Payment\n\nGuarantees arose in the following circumstances in relation to a turnkey project awarded\n\nby Petronet LNG Ltd for the engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning of a\n\nliquefied natural gas receiving, storage and re-gasification terminal at Dahej, State of\n\nGujarat, India (\"the project)\". Petronet LNG Ltd is a limited company\n\nincorporated under the laws of India and the defendants is a Dutch company. Together with\n\nfour other internationally well-known construction companies the defendants were awarded\n\nthe Main Contract for the Project. The Main Contract provided for inter laia the\n\ncompletion of a detached breakwater to protect the LNG terminal. The deadline for\n\ncompletion was 27 December 2003.7\n\n        On 26 January 2001, the defendants\n\nsub-contracted to the plaintiffs the construction of the detached breakwater. The\n\nsub-contract, as usual, provided that the defendants may give notice to the plaintiffs to\n\nproceed with the Subcontract works with due diligence, failing which the Subcontract may\n\nbe terminated. By sub-clause 21.1 it was provided that any dispute arising between the\n\nplaintiffs and the defendants arising out of the execution of the Subcontract works shall\n\nbe finally settled by arbitration in accordance with the rules of arbitration as laid down\n\nin the Main Contract. The place of arbitration, the procedural law applicable to the\n\narbitration, the law applicable to the substance of the dispute, the language of the\n\narbitral proceedings and the number of arbitrators shall be as specified in the Main\n\nContract. Under the Main Contract, any dispute arising out of or relating to the contract\n\nor with respect to the breach, termination or invalidity thereof shall be settled\n\nexclusively and finally by arbitration. Arbitration shall be conducted in accordance with\n\nthe Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It was provided that the place of arbitration\n\nshall be in New Delhi, India and that the governing law of the Main Contract shall be the\n\nlaws of the Republic of India.8\n\n        The plaintiffs’ application for leave to\n\nserve the Amended Originating Summons out of jurisdiction was based on Order 11 r 1(b),\n\n(c), (d)(iii) and (iv) and (r) of the Rules of Court. Rule 11 r 1(c) was not relied on a\n\nthe hearing before me.9\n\n        Order 11 r 1(b) of the Rules of Court permits\n\nservice out of jurisdiction with leave where in an action \"an injunction is sought\n\nordering the defendant to do or refrain from doing anything in Singapore (whether or not\n\ndamages are also claimed in respect of a failure to do or the doing of that thing).\"\n\nUnder Order 11 r 1 (d)(iii) and (iv) such service out of jurisdiction is permitted where\n\nthe claim is brought to enforce, rescind, dissolve, annul or otherwise affect a contract,\n\nor to recover damages or obtain other relief in respect of the breach of a contract, being\n\n(in either case) a contract which under paragraph (iii) is by its terms, or by\n\nimplication, governed by the law of Singapore or under paragraph (iv) the contract\n\ncontains a term to the effect that that Court shall have jurisdiction to hear and\n\ndetermine any action in respect of the contract. Under Order 11 r 1(r) such service out of\n\njurisdiction is also permitted with leave where ‘the claim is in respect of matters\n\nin which the defendants has submitted or agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the\n\ncourt.\"10\n\n        As to jurisdiction, it is relevant to refer to\n\nsection 16 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap. 322) which provides as follows:\"16(1) The High Court shall\n\n    have jurisdiction to hear and try any action in personam where-(a)    the defendant is served\n\n    with a writ or other originating process-(i)    in Singapore in the manner\n\n      prescribed by Rules of Court; or(ii)    outside Singapore in\n\n      circumstances authorized by and in the manner prescribed by Rules of Court; or(b)    the defendant submits to\n\n    the jurisdiction of the High Court.(2) Without prejudice to the\n\n    generality of subsection (1), the High Court shall have jurisdiction as is vested in it by\n\n    any other written law.\"11\n\n        In relation to the plaintiffs’ application\n\nfor leave, the ‘other written law’ under subsection 16(2) refers to the\n\nInternational Arbitration Act (Cap 143A, 1995 Ed.).",
        "Principles governing leave to\n\nserve out of jurisdiction": "12\n\n        A court in granting leave to serve a writ or\n\noriginating process out of jurisdiction has to consider, first, whether jurisdiction under\n\nOrder 11 rule 1 of the Rules of Court has been sufficiently established on the basis of a\n\ngood and arguable case:Bradley Lomas Electrolok Ltd & Another v Colt Ventilation\n\nEast Asia Pte Ltd & Ors[2000] 1 SLR 673. A mere statement by a deponent that he\n\nbelieved the matter fell within a particular limb was insufficient. On the other hand, it\n\nwas noted by the Court of Appeal in the same case that a court on such an application was\n\nnot called upon to try the action or express a premature opinion on its merits. The Court\n\nof Appeal further ruled that it was only when jurisdiction was so shown to exist that the\n\ncourt would proceed to determine whether it should exercise its discretion to grant leave\n\nand for this purpose the plaintiff need only show merits on the claim up to the level of a\n\nserious issue to be tried. In these principlesSeaconsar Far East Ltd v Bank Markazi\n\nJomhouri Islami Iran[1994] 1 AC 438 was followed.",
        "The Circumstances in this case": "13\n\n        In the present case, the plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat the defendants have been in breach in many respects and that it would be conscionable\n\nfor them to call upon the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees. These were denied by\n\nthe defendants who asserted counter allegations in extenso. Both sides relied on a\n\nsubstantial body of contemporaneous documents. Suffice it to say that the plaintiffs have\n\nestablished a good arguable case to ground jurisdiction. By this Originating Summons they\n\nseek for an interim preservation order pending the arbitration. Further, the court has\n\npower to grant interim injunctions as provided by section 12(1)(g) and (6) of the\n\nInternational Arbitration Act (\"the IAA\"). As set out in Article 9 of the Model\n\nLaw in the First Schedule of the IAA, it is \"not incompatible with an arbitration\n\nagreement for a party to request, before or during arbitral proceedings, from a court an\n\ninterim measure of protection and for the court to grant such measure\": seePT\n\nGaruda Indonesia v Bergen Air[2002] 1 SLR 393, 398 at para 21. The plaintiffs are not\n\nasking the court to finally determine the rights of the parties in respect of the\n\nSubcontract or in respect of the termination of the appointment of the plaintiffs under\n\nthe Subcontract. In my view, that would not be possible in view of the reliefs sought by\n\nthe plaintiffs which are set out above.14\n\n        It was pointed out at the appeal that the\n\nplaintiffs had given notice of arbitration on 10 September 2002 and the matters included\n\nin the arbitral reference included disputes regarding the call on the Bond and Advance\n\nPayment Guarantees. But counsel for the plaintiffs stressed that there was some urgency in\n\nthe matter because under clause 21.2 of the Subcontract it was provided that \"no\n\nrecourse to arbitration shall be made unless and until an attempt has first been made to\n\nsettle amicably\" and that \"a period of 90 days after either party has served\n\nwritten notice on the other of their intention to refer the dispute to arbitration shall\n\nbe allowed for amicable settlement.\" Without the interim injunctive relief, it was\n\npointed out that payment might be made and it was not likely that the monies would be\n\ndestined for India to meet any arbitral award in favour of the plaintiffs.15\n\n        The central argument of the defendants in the\n\nappeal was that the dispute between the parties was whether the defendants were entitled\n\nto terminate the Subcontract and that the subject-matter of the dispute is in substance\n\nthe Subcontract and not the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees. The governing laws of\n\nthe Subcontract is the law of India and the defendants did not agree to the law of\n\nSingapore nor submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of Singapore. In my view, this\n\nargument does not address the unalterable fact that so far as the Bond and the Advance\n\nPayment Guarantees are concerned, the parties thereto, namely the AHA and the defendants\n\nhad expressly agreed that the governing law of it is the law of Singapore and that they\n\nsubmit to the jurisdiction of our courts. A third party like the plaintiffs, having given\n\nthe counter indemnities, is interested in the dispute in respect of the enforceability of\n\nthose documents.16\n\n        It was argued by the defendants thatMercedes-Benz\n\nAG v Leiduck[1995] 3 All ER 803 is against the grant of leave to serve out of\n\njurisdiction under Order 11 rule 1 (b) of the Rules of Court. It was argued that there is\n\nno substantive relief sought in these proceedings. Para 11/1/10 of Supreme Court Practice\n\n1997 Vol. 1 summarised the case thus: \"Even though proceedings may technically fall\n\nwithin this sub-rule, the discretion to grant leave will not be exercised unless: (i) an\n\ninjunction is a genuine part of the relief sought and has not been claimed merely to bring\n\nthe case within the rule…and (ii) there is a reasonable prospect of an injunction\n\n(itself a discretionary remedy) being granted.\" A mareva injunction was obtained and\n\nserved on the defendant pursuant to the leave granted to serve the writ out of\n\njurisdiction. Only the relief of mareva injunction was prayed in the action. The majority\n\nof the Judicial Committee of the Privy Couincil, with Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead\n\ndissenting, ruled that a mareva injunction wassui generisin that, unlike other\n\nforms of injunction, it did not decide any substantive rights, and did not call into\n\nexistence any process upon which they could work. Counsel for the plaintiffs argued that\n\ninMercedes-Benz AGthe relief prayed for was not anything like the injunction\n\nprayed for in this case. It was more in the nature of an attachment of the assets of the\n\ndefendant pending the determination of proceedings in another jurisdiction, which came to\n\npast, and on the basis of that judgment the plaintiffs obtained attachment orders against\n\nshares of the defendant held in a Hong Kong company. I agreed with counsel in this case\n\nthe injunction sought by the plaintiffs is a substantive relief and it determines the\n\nrights of the defendants under the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees as to his\n\nentitlement to monies thereunder and the amount payable. Further, I also agreed that in\n\nSingapore we have the IAA and Article 9 of Model Law.17\n\n        On the evidence, I concluded that the\n\nplaintiffs had made out a good arguable case as to why it would be unconscionable on the\n\npart of the defendants to receive monies under the Bond and the Advance Payments\n\nGuarantees. I further concluded that there were serious questions to be tried on the\n\nvarious claims and counterclaims of the parties. As parties had agreed that Singapore law\n\ngovern the three instruments and had submitted to the jurisdiction of the Singapore Courts\n\nin relation to any disputes arising out of those instruments I came to the view that\n\nSingapore was the more appropriate forum, bearing in mind that the proper law of the Bond\n\nand the Advance Payment Guarantee being Singapore law was \"the predominating\n\nfactor\" as explained by Kerr J (as he then was) inB.P. Exploration v Hunt[1976] 1 Q.B. (Com. Ct) 471, 482 lhc. There were not present in this case other\n\nconsiderations of overwhelming weight which militate against the Singapore Courts. I\n\ntherefore concluded that the appropriate forum for deciding the rights of the plaintiffs\n\nand the defendants under the Bond and the Advance Payment Guarantees were the Courts of\n\nSingapore.18\n\n        For these reasons I allowed the appeal and\n\naffirmed the leave granted to serve the Originating Summons out of jurisdiction.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
