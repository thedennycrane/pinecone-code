        "The works and the claims": "2.\n\n        In September 1995, the developers engaged the\n\ncontractors to construct a housing project at Saraca Road/Begonia Road, Singapore\n\n(‘the works’). The contract price was $17,861,724.20 as adjusted in accordance\n\nwith the contract; the contract period was 50 weeks; the original completion date was 18\n\nOctober 1996 and liquidated damages were payable at $8,000 per day of delay.3.\n\n        The works were not completed on time. As such,\n\non 21 October 1996, the architect issued a Delay Certificate (the ‘Original Delay\n\nCertificate’) in accordance with clause 23 of the contract. This started the clock\n\nrunning for the payment of liquidated damages from 18 October 1996 up to the completion of\n\nthe works. Thereafter, on three separate occasions, the architect granted extensions of\n\ntime, totalling 130 days in all, successively extending the completion date.4.\n\n        Three Termination of Delay Certificates were\n\nissued by the architect to effect the grants of extension of time and three Further Delay\n\nCertificates were also issued as the works remained incomplete by the respective extended\n\ncontract completion dates. By his successive grants of extensions of time, the architect\n\nreduced the contractors’ liability for liquidated damages by some $1,040,000.5.\n\n        In the course of the works, the architect also\n\nissued various certificates for payment in favour of the contractors. The developers paid\n\nall of these certified sums save for a sum of $1,729,561.80 which they withheld on account\n\nof the liquidated damages that had accrued pursuant to the Delay Certificates.6.\n\n        On the face of the architect’s\n\ncertificates as they currently stand, the developers owe the contractors $1,729,561.80 as\n\npayment for works done and the contractors in turn owe the developers $4,511,456.68 for\n\nliquidated damages up to 4 November 1998.",
        "Recovery proceedings –\n\ninitial steps": "7.\n\n        The contractors disputed the developers’\n\ndeduction of $1,729,561.80 and sought to recover that amount. In February 1999, they\n\ncommenced High Court Suit No. 284 of 1999. In this action, they sought a declaration that\n\nthe Original Delay Certificate, the first two Termination of Delay Certificates and the\n\nfirst two Further Delay Certificates were invalid and that the deduction of liquidated\n\ndamages by the developers based on those delay certificates was also invalid. They claimed\n\nthe deducted sum of $1,729,561.80. The contractors applied for summary judgment on their\n\nclaim and the developers applied for the proceedings to be stayed pending arbitration. The\n\ndevelopers also resisted the summary judgment application on the basis that all\n\ncertificates issued were valid and the sum of $1,729,561.80 had been properly deducted.8.\n\n        The Assistant Registrar granted an order in\n\nterms of the contractors’ summary judgment application. The developers appealed\n\nsuccessfully and the Judge set aside the judgment and stayed further proceedings in the\n\naction pending arbitration.9.\n\n        On 5 April 2000, the contractors gave notice of\n\narbitration. In May 2000, Mr John Chung (whom the contractors had nominated) was appointed\n\nas arbitrator. In the arbitration proceedings, the contractors are claiming, amongst other\n\nthings, additional time to complete the works, damages for loss and expense arising from\n\ndelays in the works (for which the contractors are alleging the developers and/or their\n\nagents were responsible) and outstanding payments for the works. The amounts claimed\n\ninclude the amount of $1,729,561.80 certified due by the architect but withheld on the\n\nbasis of the Delay Certificates issued.",
        "Initial proceedings in the\n\narbitration": "10.\n\n        On 21 July 2000, the arbitrator gave directions\n\nfor the filing of pleadings by the parties. At that time, the contractors were represented\n\nby Messrs Rajah & Tann whilst the developers were represented by Messrs Wong Tan &\n\nMolly Lim. The contractors duly filed their points of claim.11.\n\n        Some time thereafter, the developers changed\n\nlawyers and appointed Messrs Wong Partnership as their new solicitors. On 11 April 2001,\n\nthe developers’ points of defence and counterclaim were filed on their behalf by\n\ntheir new solicitors. On reading the points of defence and counterclaim, the contractors\n\ntook the view that the developers had changed their position on the validity of the\n\nTermination of Delay Certificates and the Further Delay Certificates and were thus no\n\nlonger entitled to set off their liquidated damages claim against the entire sum claimed\n\nby the applicants.12.\n\n        On 29 June 2001, the contractors made an\n\napplication to the arbitrator requesting that certain issues be tried as preliminary\n\nissues. Eight issues were put forward for consideration to be tried as preliminary issues\n\nand they covered a variety of matters. The developers objected to having the preliminary\n\nissues tried.13.\n\n        A hearing took place on 13 August 2001 for the\n\narbitrator to determine whether he should hear the preliminary issues. The developers\n\nobjected to various matters being tried as preliminary issues on the basis that the same\n\nwere not fit for summary determination. They contended that the issues relied on a host of\n\ndisputed or assumed facts and if the actual facts found were different, the preliminary\n\ndetermination would be rendered nugatory.14.\n\n        On 24 August 2001, the arbitrator informed\n\nparties that he had decided, after due consideration, not to hear the preliminary issues\n\nas he was not convinced that to do so would result in a substantial saving of time and\n\ncosts.",
        "Application for interim award": "15.\n\n        The contractors were not happy with this\n\ndecision because it meant that it would be some time before the arbitration proper would\n\nbe held. In the meantime, they would continue to be held out of receipt of $1,729,561.80\n\non the basis of Further Delay Certificates which certificates they believed the\n\ncontractors had now admitted to be invalid. The contractors found this situation to be\n\nunacceptable.16.\n\n        On 17 October 2001, therefore, the contractors\n\napplied for an interim award in the sum of $1,729,561.80. According to the contractors,\n\nthe application was made pursuant to the terms of the contract that provide that payment\n\ncertificates should be given full effect by way of summary judgment or interim award\n\n(namely clauses 31(11) and 37(3)(h) of the SIA Conditions) and on the basis that the\n\ndevelopers’ change of position in relation to the validity of the Termination and\n\nFurther Delay Certificates reopened the whole issue of whether the developers had a valid\n\nright of set off to justify non-payment of the Certificates of Payment.17.\n\n        In correspondence, the employers raised\n\npreliminary objections to the application for interim award by arguing that the principle\n\nofres judicataapplied in that:(1)    the\n\n    application for interim award was precluded from being heard by virtue of the application\n\n    for summary judgment for similar relief having been heard in the High Court suit and a\n\n    stay of proceedings having been ordered;(2)    the\n\n    contractors were effectively asking the arbitration to consider issues which the\n\n    arbitrator had, by his decision in respect of the application for a hearing of preliminary\n\n    issues, already decided not to hear.They also made certain arguments\n\nrelating to the substance of the contractors’ application.18.\n\n        Following further correspondence between the\n\nsolicitors for the respective parties and the arbitrator to clarify the purpose of the\n\nproposed hearing, the arbitrator agreed to hear the employers’ preliminary objections\n\nbefore deciding whether to hear the contractors’ application. In his letter of 9\n\nNovember 2001, the arbitrator stated: ‘I will hear the [employers’] objections\n\nto the [contractors’] application first before deciding whether to hear the\n\n[contractors’] application, which I will fix on another day’.",
        "Hearing on 4 January 2002": "19.\n\n        The hearing referred to in the letter of 9\n\nNovember 2001 eventually took place on 4 January 2002. It was attended by the parties and\n\ntheir respective solicitors and lasted about 3 hours. The employers’ counsel, Mr\n\nWong Meng Meng, SC, submitted first, followed by the contractors’ counsel, Mr\n\nSundaresh Menon. Mr Wong then replied. Mr Menon then sought to, and did, make further\n\nsubmissions. The arbitrator afforded Mr Menon this opportunity despite objections by Mr\n\nWong.20.\n\n        Mr Wong made oral submissions. He also put in\n\nan eight page written submission. The first four paragraphs of this document read:‘I. INTRODUCTION1. The Claimants [ie the\n\n    contractors] have applied for an interim award for the principal sum of $1,729,561.80,\n\n    being the liquidated damages deducted by the Respondents [ie the employers].2. The Respondents’\n\n    preliminary objections are that the application is barred by res judicata/issue estoppel\n\n    and it amounts to a collateral attack on the earlier decision of the Arbitrator on 24\n\n    August 2001 when you disallowed the Claimants’ application for preliminary issues to\n\n    be decided.3. Alternatively, the Respondents\n\n    say that the issues in the present application are not appropriate for summary disposal.4. Even if the Claimants surmount\n\n    the res judicata/issue estoppel/ collateral attack hurdle, the Respondents say the\n\n    application should be dismissed on the merits. This will, of course, be dealt with in a\n\n    separate hearing if the Arbitrator decides to hear the Claimants’ application, and\n\n    the Respondents reserve the right to file further affidavits dealing with the substantive\n\n    matters raised in the Claimants’ application and affidavit.’21.\n\n        According to Ms Elly Tham, one of the\n\nsolicitors for the developers, Mr Wong’s oral submissions focussed more on the point\n\nthat the issues were not suitable for summary determination while a large part of Mr\n\nMenon’s oral submissions dealt with the issue ofres judicata. Mr Menon also\n\nput in written submissions and in this document counsel dealt with the two issues raised\n\nby the employers’ solicitors in their correspondence. The written submissions also\n\nstated that for the purpose of the hearing the contractors would address only those issues\n\nand would not address the merits of their intended application.22.\n\n        According to Ms Tham, having said that, Mr\n\nMenon did submit on the point of suitability of the matters for summary disposal and did\n\nso by citing two relevant cases which had been referred to by Mr Wong. He submitted that\n\nthe issues of waiver and validity of Delay Certificates could and should be the object of\n\nsummary proceedings. Mr Menon also submitted that whether these two cases were\n\nstraightforward as contended by Mr Wong should be dealt with when the interim award\n\napplication proper came to be heard.23.\n\n        The hearing took place on a Friday. On Monday,\n\n7 January, counsel for the contractors sent the arbitrator a letter. The purpose of this\n\nletter was to set out what were described as ‘some of the key points made by Mr Menon\n\nin his closing oral remarks’ so that the same would be on record. In this letter, the\n\narbitrator was reminded that the hearing had been solely on the developers’\n\nobjections to the contractors’ application being heard. It also stated that all\n\nsubmissions put forward on the suitability or otherwise of the case for summary disposal\n\n‘necessarily entail an incursion(sic)into the merits – something we\n\nhave not been able to address you on as yet’.",
        "The arbitrator’s decision\n\nand its consequences": "24.\n\n        On 8 January 2002, the arbitrator notified the\n\nparties that he did not consider it appropriate to hear the application for an interim\n\naward. His letter stated:‘Having considered the\n\n    matter, I am of the view that it would not be appropriate at this juncture to hear the\n\n    application for an Interim Award. The Claimants’ application is premised on the\n\n    Respondents’ position, as set out in the Points of Defence and Counterclaim, that the\n\n    architect should not have issued the Termination of Delay Certificates and the Further\n\n    Delay Certificates. To succeed in their application for an Interim Award for the release\n\n    of monies alleged to have been wrongfully deducted by the Claimants pursuant to the Delay\n\n    Certificates dated 21 October 1996, the Claimants would have to challenge the validity of\n\n    the said Delay Certificates. The validity of the Delay Certificate, together with the\n\n    Claimants’ entitlement to any extensions of time are the main issues in the\n\n    arbitration. To determine the validity of the Delay Certificate, I would have to hear the\n\n    evidence of all the facts and circumstances leading to its issue. As such, the ruling I\n\n    would have to make must necessarily be final and not interim in nature. An Interim Award\n\n    on the validity of the Delay Certificate must in fact be the Final Award. The validity of\n\n    the Delay Certificate should therefore be determined at the full arbitration\n\n    hearing.’25.\n\n        The contractors were, as they expressed it,\n\nastonished by the arbitrator’s decision not to hear their application and especially\n\nthe reasoning underlying that decision. Their lawyers were not, however, so shocked as to\n\nbe rendered incapable of speech and they immediately proceeded to write a lengthy letter\n\nto the arbitrator to persuade him to change his mind. They gave him the reasons why they\n\nthought that he had seriously erred in his decision and invited him to reconsider his\n\nruling. The employers’ solicitors then wrote to the arbitrator and supported his\n\ndecision. The contractors’ solicitors responded by a letter which in their view\n\nrefuted all the allegations made by the employers’ solicitors.26.\n\n        On 14 January, the arbitrator advised parties\n\nthat he had reconsidered the matter and decided that his ruling of 8 January would stand.27.\n\n        The contractors and their solicitors took the\n\nview that there had been a breach of natural justice in that the arbitrator had decided on\n\nthe merits of the application for an interim award when the hearing of 4 January had been\n\nfor the purpose only of considering the preliminary objections to the application. At that\n\nstage, however, the contractors did not take out an application to remove the arbitrator.\n\nInstead, their solicitors wrote to the arbitrator on 16 January asking for a scheduled\n\nhearing for the giving of directions to be postponed while they considered how to proceed.\n\nThey also asked for a copy of the arbitrator’s notes of the 4thJanuary\n\nhearing and that he clarify whether there were any particular reasons underlying his\n\ndecision not to reverse his earlier ruling.28.\n\n        Over the next few days, more letters were sent\n\nby both parties to the arbitrator. On 21 January, the arbitrator informed the\n\ncontractors’ solicitors that his notes were for his own reference and he had no\n\nintention of disclosing them. He did not clarify his reasons for not reversing his\n\ndecision. On 24 January, the contractors informed the arbitrator, through their\n\nsolicitors, that they viewed his decision of 8 January 2002 and subsequent events as a\n\nserious breach of natural justice and had lost all confidence in his ability to conduct\n\nthe proceeding in a ‘transparent, fair and balanced manner’. They requested that\n\nhe discharge himself as arbitrator. On 25 January, the arbitrator responded by advising\n\nboth parties to continue with the reference.29.\n\n        The contractors then sought an opinion from a\n\nQueen’s Counsel on the conduct of the arbitrator. The opinion they received on 6\n\nFebruary stated that the arbitrator’s conduct had constituted misconduct. The\n\ncontractors sent this opinion to the arbitrator and asked him again to discharge himself.\n\nThe arbitrator replied that he intended to continue with the reference. This was not the\n\nend of the matter and both parties continued to bombard the arbitrator with letters.30.\n\n        On 25 February, the contractors informed the\n\narbitrator that they intended to make an application to court to remove him under s17 of\n\nthe Act. They asked the arbitrator whether he wished to be joined as a defendant or to\n\notherwise participate in the proceedings. The arbitrator declined this invitation on the\n\nsame day.",
        "The law": "31.\n\n        There is no dispute on the law applicable to\n\nthis application. It is founded on s 17 of the Act which states:’17. - (1) Where an\n\n    arbitrator or umpire has misconducted himself or the proceedings, the court may remove\n\n    him.’There is no statutory definition\n\nof what constitutes ‘misconduct’ but this term has been discussed in many cases\n\nand academic texts and there is a clear understanding of what it means in relation to the\n\nbehaviour of an arbitrator in respect of himself or the proceedings. It should be noted at\n\nonce that to find misconduct on the part of the arbitrator does not of itself impute any\n\nslur on his character. Misconduct can be found in respect of the technical handling of the\n\narbitration and need not be a matter of bias or prejudice or other disreputable action on\n\nthe part of the arbitrator.32.Halsbury’s Laws of England(4thEd Reissue) vol 2 in paragraph 694 states:‘Misconduct has been\n\n    described as \"such a mishandling of arbitration as its likely to amount to some\n\n    substantial miscarriage of justice\". Most cases depend as much upon the terms of\n\n    reference and on the surrounding circumstances as upon the conduct of the arbitrator and\n\n    it is therefore difficult to provide an exhaustive definition of the term.Where an arbitrator fails to\n\n    comply with the terms, express or implied, of the arbitration agreement, that will amount\n\n    to misconduct … in particular, it would be misconduct to act in a way which is, or\n\n    appears to be, unfair. Misconduct committed in good faith is sometimes referred to as\n\n    \"technical misconduct\", though all allegations of misconduct assert a breach of\n\n    duty. It is not misconduct to make an erroneous finding of law or fact.’Further down in the same\n\nparagraphHalsbury’sgives some instances where misconduct has been found to\n\noccur. These include, where, by his award the arbitrator purports to decide matters which\n\nhave not in fact been included in the agreement of reference and where he has acted\n\nunfairly and in breach of the rules of natural justice.Halsbury’s Laws of\n\nSingapore,vol 2 at paragraph 20.127 comments that the term ‘misconduct’ has\n\nbeen given a wide meaning and any mishandling of the arbitration, which may lead to some\n\nsubstantial miscarriage of justice may be misconduct. No actual bias or partiality need be\n\nshown as long as the court is satisfied from the conduct of the arbitrator, either by his\n\nwords, his action or inaction or his handling of the proceedings, that he displayed a real\n\nlikelihood that he might not be able to act judicially.33.\n\n        The leading authority on this issue is the case\n\nofModern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd v C Miskin & Son Ltd15 BLR 82. Dealing\n\nwith the facts of the case, Lord Denning MR stated (at p 95):‘I would not suggest –\n\n    no one has suggested – that the arbitrator misconducted \"himself\". But what\n\n    is said is that he misconducted the \"proceedings\". It is as plain as it can be\n\n    that he misconducted the proceedings. He decided a case against the party without having\n\n    heard the submissions in the case. He made a formal award against Modern Engineering\n\n    without having heard counsel on their behalf. That is clearly a breach of natural\n\n    justice.’His Lordship then went on at p 96\n\nto deal with the proper test which is to be applied in cases like this. He said:‘This does seem to me a most\n\n    serious matter. The judge put this test to himself in his judgment: Are the circumstances\n\n    such as to demonstrate that the arbitrator is not a fit and proper person to continue to\n\n    conduct the arbitration proceedings? I do not think that was the right test. I would ask\n\n    whether his conduct was such as to destroy the confidence of the parties, or either of\n\n    them, in his ability to come to a fair and just conclusion.The question is whether the way\n\n    he conducted himself in the case was such that the parties can no longer have confidence\n\n    in him. It seems to me that if this arbitrator is allowed to continue with this\n\n    arbitration one at least of the parties will have no confidence in him. He would feel that\n\n    the issue has been prejudged against him. It is most undesirable that either party should\n\n    go away from a judge or an arbitrator saying, \"I have not had a fair\n\n    hearing\".’34.\n\n        Later authorities accepted the test inModern\n\nEngineeringand construed it as being an objective one. InThe Elissar[1984] 2 LLR 84 the appropriate test was said to be: Do there exist grounds from which a reasonable\n\nperson would think that there was a real likelihood that the arbitrator could not, or\n\nwould not, fairly determine the relevant issue on the basis of the evidence and arguments\n\nto be adduced before him (per Ackner LJ at p 89).",
        "The allegations of misconduct": "35.\n\n        In their written submissions, the contractors\n\nmade four allegations of misconduct on the part of the arbitrator. When oral argument took\n\nplace, however, their counsel agreed that the real issue was whether they could\n\nsubstantiate the first allegation of misconduct. I will, therefore, deal only with that\n\nallegation.36.\n\n        The allegation of misconduct which I have to\n\ndecide is whether there was a breach of natural justice. This allegation comes in two\n\nparts. It is alleged that:(1) the arbitrator had\n\n    effectively ruled against the contractors on the merits of their application for an\n\n    interim award without affording the contractors an opportunity to be heard on the merits\n\n    and without the assistance of submissions and of any evidence by way of affidavits or\n\n    otherwise; and(2) the arbitrator had prejudged\n\n    the matter by ruling that the matter was not fit for summary disposal when the only matter\n\n    to be determined was whether to hear the contractors’ application in the first place.37.\n\n        In deciding this issue, I must start on the\n\nbasis that the arbitrator knew that the sole purpose of the hearing of 4 January 2002 was\n\nto consider whether the developers’ preliminary objections to the contractors’\n\napplication for an interim award were well founded. The correspondence between the\n\narbitrator and the respective parties specified that this was the purpose of the hearing\n\nand that the merits of the contractors’ application would not be considered on 4\n\nJanuary.38.\n\n        The contractors submitted that contrary to his\n\ndeclared intention to hear the employers’ objections before deciding whether to hear\n\nthe contractors’ application, which he would fix on another day, the arbitrator on 8\n\nJanuary 2002 decided not to hear the contractors’ application on grounds that went to\n\nthe merits of the application rather than on the basis of the preliminary objections\n\nraised by the employers. They submitted that the arbitrator did this by ruling on the\n\nfollowing premises:(1) that in order to succeed in\n\n    the intended application, the contractors would have to challenge the validity of the\n\n    Delay Certificate dated 21 October 1996;(2) that the validity of that\n\n    Delay Certificate was one of the main issues in the arbitration;(3) that to determine the\n\n    validity of that Delay Certificate, he would have to hear evidence of all the facts and\n\n    circumstances leading to its issue;(4) that as such, the ruling he\n\n    would have to make would necessarily be final and not interim in nature; and(5) that an interim award on the\n\n    validity of that Delay Certificate must in fact be the final award.In effect, they submitted, the\n\narbitrator made a ruling on the merits of the interim award application by prejudging the\n\nissues and not affording the contractors the right to be heard on any of the premises set\n\nout above. None of these issues, they said, were ever put by the arbitrator to the parties\n\nat the 4January hearing and were only made apparent when the arbitrator\n\ndelivered his decision four days later.39.\n\n        The employers strongly contested that\n\nassertion. Mr Wong submitted that that the proper issue was canvassed before the\n\narbitrator. He agreed that in his firm’s correspondence only two issues had been\n\nstated as the basis of the developers’ preliminary objections ieres judicata/issue\n\nestoppel and collateral attack. When it came to the hearing, however, his written\n\nsubmissions had detailed three issues. The third of these issues, the one that had not\n\nbeen contained in his letters, was whether the matter was an appropriate one for summary\n\ndisposal and it was on this issue that the arbitrator decided the application. Mr Wong\n\nthen went through the submissions he had made before the arbitrator and pointed out\n\nseveral paragraphs where arguments had been made about it being not appropriate to decide\n\nthe issues in a summary way and where it had been made clear to the arbitrator that there\n\nwere disputes of fact which could not be decided in summary proceedings.40.\n\n        Mr Wong agreed that the contractors had not had\n\nan opportunity to be heard on the full merits of the application. He asserted, however,\n\nthat the arbitrator had not come to a decision on the full merits of the application. His\n\ndecision had been on whether this was a suitable case for an interim application and, on\n\nthat issue, the contractors had been heard. Mr Menon had submitted on whether it was\n\nappropriate at the hearing for the interim award to go into the issue of the validity or\n\notherwise of the Original Delay Certificate. Mr Menon had put in his submissions on\n\nsuitability in that he had cited and dealt with the cases ofTropicon Contractors Pte\n\nLtd v Lojan Properties Pte Ltd[1989] SLR 610 andLian Soon Construction Pte Ltd v\n\nGuan Qian Realty Pte Ltd[1992] 2 SLR 233which were cases which had not been referred\n\nto at all in Mr Wong’s written submissions. Mr Menon’s submission did not in any\n\nway deal with the validity of the Original Delay Certificate and why, on the facts, the\n\ncontractors considered that certificate to be invalid. That was an argument left for the\n\nhearing on the merits.41.\n\n        Mr Wong also stated that when he had completed\n\nhis submissions before the arbitrator, Mr Menon had gone ahead with his reply as contained\n\nin the written submissions given to the arbitrator. Mr Menon had not stated that the\n\narguments raised by the developers were a surprise and that he needed to stand the matter\n\ndown in order to deal with them. Instead, it was submitted, Mr Menon had dealt with Mr\n\nWong’s arguments in substance in his oral reply.42.\n\n        Having examined the written submissions which\n\nMr Menon placed before the arbitrator and his letter of 7 January detailing his oral\n\nresponse to the arguments of Mr Wong, it is apparent that at the start of the hearing, the\n\nfocus of the contractors was the preliminary objections raised by the employers. They did\n\nnot go to the hearing of 4 January with the intention of dealing with the merits of their\n\napplication and their submissions were tailored to dealing with the assertions ofres\n\njudicataand collateral attack. The written submissions contain no reference to the\n\nmerits of the application nor to the suitability of dealing in a summary application with\n\nthe issues that it would be necessary to deal with in a hearing on merits. As for Mr\n\nMenon’s oral reply to the suitability arguments introduced for the first time at the\n\nhearing by the employers, both the affidavit of Ms Elly Tham and the letter of 7 January\n\nshow that, insofar as Mr Menon raised theTropiconandLian Sooncases in\n\nhis reply to Mr Wong’s submissions, they were brought forward for the purpose of\n\nshowing that the arbitrator had a duty to scrutinise any attempt to deny payment due to\n\nthe contractors under a valid payment certificate. These cases were not raised in the\n\ncourse of any detailed argument on the merits. Ms Tham agreed in her affidavit that the\n\npurpose of citing the two cases was to show that the arbitrator had a duty to hear the\n\ncontractors’ application for an interim award. It is clear that the aim of the\n\ncontractors throughout was to overcome the hurdle of the preliminary objections so that\n\nthe merits of their application could be heard on another day.43.\n\n        One of the points that Mr Wong put before me\n\nquite strongly, as can be seen from the foregoing paragraphs, is that Mr Menon did not\n\nobject to the objection raised at the preliminary objections hearing that the matter was\n\nnot one that was suitable for summary disposal. It appears from the evidence before me,\n\nhowever, that Mr Menon did raise such objections. In an affidavit filed in support of the\n\ncontractors’ application by one Mr Tan Hwa Peng, it was stated that during the\n\nhearing, in relation to the new submission that the matter was not suitable for summary\n\ndisposal, Mr Menon responded by reminding the arbitrator that the purpose of the hearing\n\nwas not to consider the merits of the application but whether the application ought to be\n\nheard in the first place. This point was repeated in the 7thJanuary letter\n\nsent to the arbitrator before he delivered his decision.44.\n\n        It is plain from the arbitrator’s letter\n\nof 8 January 2002 that his decision not to hear the application for an interim award was\n\nbased on his determination that such an application would involve ascertaining the\n\nvalidity of the Original Delay Certificate and that to do this he would have to hear\n\nevidence of all the facts and circumstances leading to its issue and would then make a\n\nfinal rather than an interim award. He was greatly concerned with the issue of the\n\nvalidity of that certificate and, without any submissions having been made to him on the\n\npoint, concluded that a decision on that point would determine the whole arbitration. The\n\narbitrator’s decision not to hear the interim application thus did not relate in any\n\nway to the preliminary objections canvassed by the employers through their\n\nsolicitors’ letters in October 2001. The arbitrator had himself decided before 4\n\nJanuary 2002 that all he was going to rule on was whether on these arguments, the interim\n\napplication ought to be heard in the first place. As a result, the contractors prepared\n\nsubmissions relating to these issues only. Naturally therefore, at the hearing, although\n\nthe employers’ arguments went beyond the agreed bases for the hearing, the\n\ncontractors expressly refrained from addressing their argument on the suitability of the\n\napplication for summary disposal as to do so would entail going into the merits. (By way\n\nof an aside, I note that the contractors repeatedly referred to not wanting to do anything\n\nthat would constitute ‘an incursion into the merits’ and do wonder what sort of\n\nviolent attack they were restraining themselves from launching.) Notwithstanding the\n\ncontractors’ clearly stated position, the arbitrator, without indicating in any way\n\nthat he required full arguments on the merits or that he was contemplating deciding the\n\npreliminary objection hearing on the basis of the issue of suitability, proceeded to make\n\na decision on the said basis. In my opinion, in so doing, the arbitrator misconducted the\n\narbitration in that he came to a decision on a point without giving the contractors the\n\nopportunity of putting forward submissions and evidence on that point.45.\n\n        I agree with the submission made that the\n\narbitrator acted inappropriately by:(1) going beyond his agreed\n\n    reference for the hearing on 4 January even though the boundaries of that reference had\n\n    been stipulated by him;(2) by failing to clearly\n\n    indicate during the course of the hearing and after listening to the new submission by the\n\n    employers (and one that lay outside the original boundaries prescribed) that he was\n\n    considering making a decision on the basis of that submission and consequently, by failing\n\n    to call on the contractors to put forward their answers to that submission for his\n\n    consideration; and(3) by failing to afford the\n\n    parties an opportunity to address him on the facts of the case so that he could consider\n\n    them in determining whether the issues could be dealt with summarily.In the circumstances, I rule that\n\nthere was a breach of natural justice in this case in the terms submitted by the\n\ncontractors.46.\n\n        The next question is whether the arbitrator\n\nshould be removed. As the cases make clear, the court is reluctant to remove an arbitrator\n\nbecause of the expense and delay that will be an inevitable consequence of such a removal.\n\nThus, this action will not be taken unless it is determined that the conduct of the\n\narbitrator was such as to make a reasonable person think that there was a real likelihood\n\nthat the arbitrator could not or would not fairly determine the relevant issues in the\n\narbitration. In this case, the contractors say that their confidence in the arbitrator has\n\nbeen destroyed not only because he decided a reference on points that were not before him\n\nbut also because when they asked the arbitrator to reconsider his decision bearing in mind\n\nall the circumstances of the hearing, he had refused to do so.47.\n\n        Having considered the circumstances of the\n\ncase, I have, reluctantly, concluded that the arbitrator must be removed as it appears\n\nthat there is a real likelihood of him not being able to fairly determine the issues in\n\nthe arbitration. The basic duty of an arbitrator, or any adjudicator for that matter, is\n\nto listen to both sides of the argument and give each side an opportunity to submit on all\n\nrelevant points. In this case, the arbitrator cut short the process by telescoping the two\n\nseparate parts of the interim application hearing into one and by determining the outcome\n\nof the first part of the application on the basis of issues that actually fell within the\n\nsecond part of the application without hearing full arguments on those issues from both\n\nsides. His breach of the basic duty cannot but give reason for doubting whether there can\n\nbe a fair adjudication of the issues in this arbitration which remain outstanding.",
        "Conclusion": "48.\n\n        There will be an order in terms of the motion.\n\nThe contactors’ costs shall be paid by the employers, as taxed or agreed.49.\n\n        There is one more thing that I must say. I\n\nfound the conduct of the contractors and their solicitors in the aftermath of the\n\narbitrator’s decision of January 8 to be deeply disturbing. Whilst I can appreciate\n\nthat they were upset to be shut out of having their application for an interim award heard\n\non grounds they had not been given an opportunity to deal with, that did not justify their\n\nsubsequent actions. One letter to the arbitrator asking him to reconsider was the polite\n\nand prudent course to take. Once he indicated that he was not inclined to do so that\n\nshould have been the end of the correspondence with him. Instead several more letters were\n\nwritten and attached to one of them was the Queen’s Counsel’s opinion concluding\n\nthat the arbitrator had misconducted himself. In this letter the solicitors for the\n\ncontractors invited the arbitrator, for the second time, to discharge himself from his\n\nposition. In my view, the correct course for the contractors to have adopted once the\n\narbitrator had made his position clear, if they no longer wished him to conduct the\n\narbitration, was to take out this application forthwith. They should not have harangued\n\nhim or sought to influence his decision by blandishing counsel’s opinion in his face.\n\nTheir conduct leaves a strong impression of bullying and the arbitrator’s dignified\n\nand restrained response in the face of such tactics can only be commended.Sgs:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
