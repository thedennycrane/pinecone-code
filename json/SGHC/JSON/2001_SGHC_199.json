        "BACKGROUND": "1. The Plaintiff Arubugam Suppiah (‘Suppiah’) and the\n\nDefendant Curt Evert Borgensten (‘Borgensten’) are shareholders of a company\n\nincorporated in the Bahamas called Johnson Industries Ltd (‘JIL’) in the\n\nfollowing proportions:Borgensten : 70%Suppiah : 30%2. JIL owns 100% of a company incorporated in Singapore called Johnson\n\nIndustries Pte Ltd (‘JIPL’).3. JIPL in turn owns various companies.4. As a result of various disputes between Suppiah and Borgensten, the\n\nfollowing actions were commenced in Singapore:(a) Suit No 435 of 1999(b) Originating Summons No 443 of 1999(c) Originating Summons No 1348 of 19995. These actions were settled under a Deed of Agreement dated 4\n\nFebruary 2000 (‘the Deed’).6. The relevant terms of the Deed are as follows:Clause 3.1In consideration of the payment of the non-refundable Option Price\n\n  in accordance with this clause and the grant of the Option in accordance with clause 4,\n\n  the parties hereto agree to all the terms hereinClause 3.2Borgensten shall pay Suppiah the Option Price in the following\n\n  instalments:(a) The first payment of the sum of Singapore Dollars One million\n\n    (S$1,000,000.00) on the date hereof to Suppiah; and(b) a second payment of the sum of Singapore Dollars One million\n\n    (S$1,000,000.00) on or before six (6) months from the date hereto.Clause 8It is hereby agreed that Borgensten shall be entitled to appoint\n\n  and remove all of and any number of the directors to the Board of Directors of JIL and\n\n  JIPL other than the director appointed by Suppiah provided always that Suppiah shall be\n\n  entitled to appoint and remove one (1) director (himself or his representative) to the\n\n  Board of JIL and JIPL. Suppiah shall only be entitled to appoint the said one director\n\n  each to the Board of JIL and JIPL for so long as he owns the Suppiah Shares and Borgensten\n\n  hereby undertakes to procure such appointment by Suppiah to be effected at the respective\n\n  companies. The quorum for board of directors meeting in JIL and JIPL shall be any two\n\n  directors.Clause 99.1 Borgensten hereby irrevocably and unconditionally grants to\n\n  Suppiah after the finalisation of the accounts of JIL for the financial year ending March\n\n  2000 and in any event after 30 June 2000 if such accounts are not finalised by then, the\n\n  option to require Borgensten to purchase from Suppiah the Suppiah Shares, free from all\n\n  lien charges and any encumbrances and with all rights attached thereto as at the date of\n\n  exercise of the Put Option. This Put Option may be exercised by Suppiah in respect of all\n\n  (and not part only of the Suppiah Shares) by the service of a written notice on Borgensten\n\n  in the form of Schedule Two. Upon receipt of such notice, Suppiah shall be authorised to\n\n  instruct the auditors of JIL to determine the Specified Price.Borgensten shall pay for the Suppiah Shares the Specified Price over a\n\n  period of twenty four (24) months in eight (8) equal quarterly instalments, the first such\n\n  being paid within thirty (30) days of the Specified Price being determined and Suppiah\n\n  shall transfer the Suppiah Shares to Borgensten in eight (8) equal parts as and when\n\n  payment of an instalment is made by Borgensten.Clause 10.1.2Suppiah and Borgensten shall use all endeavours to finalise the\n\n  accounts of JIL for the financial year ending March 2000 as soon as possible. Borgensten\n\n  shall take all necessary steps to ensure that JIL and JIPL provides all directors in JIL\n\n  and JIPL with quarterly management accounts, such quarterly accounts to be provided within\n\n  90 days of the expiry of such quarter. For the purposes of this clause the first quarter\n\n  for which management accounts are to be provided shall be the quarter commencing 1stApril 2000. Further, Borgensten shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the\n\n  unaudited annual accounts of JIL and JIPL shall be made available to all directors in JIL\n\n  and JIPL within 90 days of the closing of the financial year. Borgensten shall ensure that\n\n  each of the directors gets a copy of the audited accounts of JIL and JIPL within 14 days\n\n  of the audited accounts being made available.Clause 11Each Party undertakes to the other that it shall from time to time\n\n  on written request by any Party at the requesting party’s cost do or procure the\n\n  doing of all such acts and will execute or procure the execution of all such documents as\n\n  any Party may reasonably consider necessary or desirable for giving full effect to this\n\n  Deed or securing to the others the full benefits of all rights, powers and remedies\n\n  conferred upon the others in this Deed.7. As can be seen, under Clause 3.2 of the Deed, Borgensten was\n\nsupposed to pay Suppiah $1m on the date of the Deed and another $1m on or before 4 August\n\n2000. The first $1m was paid but not the other $1m (‘the said $1m’). By a letter\n\nfrom Suppiah’s solicitors dated 7 August 2000, payment of the said $1 million was\n\nrequested. Suppiah also exercised his Put Option requiring Borgensten to purchase his\n\nshares in JIL. Borgensten failed to pay the said $1m.",
        "WRIT OF SUMMONS NO S612/2000/H": "8. Suppiah then commenced action on 15 August 2000 by filing Writ of\n\nSummons No S 612/2000/H for the said $1m.9. Suppiah subsequently applied for summary judgment and at the\n\nadjourned hearing of the application for summary judgment on 13 November 2000, an\n\nAssistant Registrar allowed the application and judgment was entered against Borgensten.10. The next day, Borgensten filed an appeal. The appeal was heard\n\nbefore me on 21 November 2000. On 28 November 2000, I dismissed Borgensten’s appeal.11. By a letter dated 4 December 2000, Borgensten’s solicitors\n\nrequested further arguments to be heard. On 15 January 2001, I heard further arguments and\n\naffirmed my original decision.12. In the meantime, after the judgment on 13 November 2000,\n\nSuppiah’s solicitors applied on 16 November 2000 for an order that Borgensten attend\n\nand be orally examined before the Registrar as to:(a) whether any and what debts are owing to him;(b) whether he has any and what other property or means of satisfying the Judgment.13. The application was heard on 16 November 2000 and allowed\n\n(‘the 16/11/00 and 1stEJD Order’). The examination was fixed for 5\n\nDecember 2000. The Order of Court was served on Borgensten by leaving it at JIPL’s\n\npremises on 27 November 2000.14. Borgensten did not attend court on 5 December 2000, as ordered.\n\nInstead, on 2 December 2000, Borgensten applied for an extension of time to comply with\n\nthe 16/11/00 and 1stEJD Order. The reason given in the affidavit for the\n\napplication for an extension of time was that winding up proceedings had been started in\n\nthe Bahamas by Suppiah and that until that was resolved, Borgensten would not be able to\n\nattend any proceedings in Singapore. Borgensten’s application for extension of time\n\nwas fixed for hearing at the same time as the EJD hearing, i.e 5 December 2000.15. At the hearing on 5 December 2000, an Assistant Registrar made an\n\norder (‘the 5/12/00 and 2ndEJD Order) including the following:‘(1) The Plaintiff is to serve on the Defendant’s solicitors\n\n  an exhaustive list of questions which they wish to ask the Defendant, such list to be\n\n  served on or before 12 December 2000 by 4.00pm. The Plaintiff shall also serve on the\n\n  Defendant’s solicitors a list of documents that they require production of, such list\n\n  to be served on or before 12 December 2000 by 4.00pm.(2) The Defendant is to file and serve an affidavit which sets out each\n\n  question and the Defendant’s answer to the question, such affidavit to be filed and\n\n  served on or before 5 January 2001 by 4.00pm. The Defendant is to produce such of the\n\n  documents requested for as are in his possession, custody and power to the\n\n  Plaintiff’s solicitors at their office on a date and time to be agreed that is on or\n\n  before 5 January 2001.(3) The date fixed for the examination of the abovenamed\n\n  Defendant/Judgment Debtor be adjourned to 9 January 2001 at 2.30pm. In the event that the\n\n  Defendant is unable to comply with these directions within the time frame stipulated, the\n\n  Defendant should take out an application for an extension of time and justify why an\n\n  extension is needed.’16. Pursuant to the 5/12/00 and 2ndEJD Order,\n\nSuppiah’s solicitors wrote to Borgensten’s solicitors on 12 December 2000\n\nsetting out the information and documents that were required from Borgensten.17. By a letter dated 3 January 2001, Suppiah’s solicitors\n\nreminded Borgensten’s solicitors that under the terms of the 5/12/00 and 2ndEJD Order, Borgensten was required to produce the documents requested in their letter\n\ndated 12 December 200 by 5 January 2001.18. Borgensten did not provide his affidavit of assets as ordered.\n\nNeither did he provide any documents. Instead, on 5 January 2001, Borgensten’s\n\nsolicitors filed an application asking for an extension of time to comply with the 5/12/00\n\nand 2ndEJD Order. One of the reasons given by Borgensten was that he was\n\nsuffering from some ‘acute illness’ which prevented him from travelling to Asia.19. At the adjourned hearing on 9 January 2001, Borgensten did not\n\nattend and was represented by his solicitors. The hearing was adjourned for two weeks and\n\nBorgensten was ordered to furnish the information and documents requested by\n\nSuppiah’s solicitors in their letter of 12 December 2000 (apparently with some minor\n\nexceptions) by way of an affidavit before the adjourned hearing on 23 January 2001, at\n\nwhich he was to attend for examination (‘the 9/1/01 and 3rdEJD\n\nOrder’). The 9/1/01 and 3rdEJD Order was served on Borgensten on 22\n\nJanuary 2001.20. Borgensten did not provide any affidavit of assets or documents as\n\nordered. He also did not attend the hearing on 23 January 2001 to be examined although his\n\nsolicitors did . He did not explain in any affidavit his failure to comply with the 9/1/01\n\nand 3rdEJD Order. The reason provided by Borgensten through his solicitors at\n\nthe hearing was that he was still considering whether to pay the said $1m or to appeal\n\nagainst my decision.21. At the hearing on 23 January 2001, an Assistant Registrar ordered\n\nas follows (‘the 23/1/01 and 4thEJD Order’):‘(1) The date fixed for the examination of the abovenamed\n\n  Defendant/Judgment Debtor be adjourned to 13 February 2001 at 2.30pm.(2) Unless the Court otherwise orders, the Judgment Debtor shall attend\n\n  personally on 13 February 2001 at 2.30pm to be examined.(3) The Judgment Debtor shall file and serve the affidavit ordered to\n\n  be filed pursuant to the Order of Court dated 9 January 2001 by 4.00pm on 6 February 2001.(4) The Judgment Creditor may serve the Judgment Debtor with a copy of\n\n  this Order of Court by delivering a copy of this Order of Court to the Judgment\n\n  Debtor’s solicitors and such service shall be deemed good and sufficient service of\n\n  the Order of Court on the Judgment Debtor.(5) The Judgment Debtor’s solicitors shall fax a copy of this\n\n  Order of Court to the Judgment Debtor and the Judgment Debtor shall be deemed to have\n\n  actual notice of this Order of Court upon such fax being sent by the Judgment\n\n  Debtor’s solicitors.’",
        "ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS": "22. While steps were being taken by Suppiah in the Writ action to\n\nrecover the said $1m, Suppiah also instituted arbitration proceedings.23. On 6 December 2000, Suppiah’s solicitors filed a Notice of\n\nArbitration alleging that Borgensten had repudiated the Deed and claiming damages.24. I set out below the allegations of the alleged repudiatory breaches\n\nby Borgensten as stated in the Notice of Arbitration:‘Repudiatory Breaches of the Deed13. In breach of clause 3.2 of the Deed, the Respondent has to\n\n  date failed to make payment of the 2nd tranche of $1 million. The Claimant has commenced\n\n  proceedings in Suit No 612/2000/H for payment of the said sum, and has obtained Judgment\n\n  on 14 November 2000. The Respondent appealed against the Judgment, to a Judge of the High\n\n  Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs on 28 November 2000. The Judgment to date\n\n  remains unsatisfied.14. By a Notice dated 7 August 2000 (\"the Notice\"), the\n\n  Claimant exercised his Put Option pursuant to clause 9 of the Deed.15. On 18 August 2000, the Claimant, through his solicitors, forwarded\n\n  a circular members’ resolution to the Respondent for his signature, to effect the\n\n  Claimant’s appointment to the Board of Directors of JIL.16. In breach of clause 8 of the Deed, and despite several reminders,\n\n  the Respondent failed, refused and/or neglected to sign the resolution and/or procure the\n\n  appointment of the Claimant to the Board of Directors of JIL.17. In breach of clause 10.1.2 of the Deed, the Respondent has also\n\n  failed, refused and/or neglected to:-17.1 Use any or sufficient endeavours to finalise the accounts of JIL\n\n    for the financial year ending 2000 as soon as possible;17.2 Take all or any necessary steps to ensure that JIL and JIPL\n\n    provides all directors in JIL and JIPL with quarterly management accounts within 90 days\n\n    of the expiry of the quarter commencing 1 April 2000;17.3 Take all or any necessary steps to ensure that the unaudited\n\n    annual accounts of JIL and JIPL were made available to all directors in JIL and JIPL\n\n    within 90 days of the closing of the financial year ended 30 March 2000.18. By 31 August 2000, the audited accounts of JIL had not yet been\n\n  prepared. The Respondent, as the sole director of JIL, had knowledge of the identity of\n\n  JIL’s auditors. Accordingly, by a letter of that date from the Claimant’s\n\n  solicitors to the Respondent, the Claimant asked the Respondent for the name and address\n\n  of JIL’s auditors by 5.00 pm on 2 September 2000.19. In breach of the Clause 11 of the Deed and despite several\n\n  reminders, the Respondent failed, refused and/or neglected to revert to the Claimant on\n\n  the identity of JIL’s auditors.20. As a result of the Respondent’s breaches of the Deed, the\n\n  Claimant has been prevented from:20.1 Seeing to the preparation of JIL’s audited accounts for the\n\n    financial year ended March 2000; and20.2 Instructing JIL’s auditors to determine the Specified Price\n\n    pursuant to Clause 9.1 of the Deed.21. The Claimant has discovered that, while preventing the\n\n  determination of the Specified Price and refusing to procure the Claimant’s\n\n  appointment to the Board of JIL, the Respondent has been making concerted efforts to\n\n  depress the value of the Claimant’s shares in JIL’s shares for the purposes of\n\n  the Deed.22. In the premises, the Respondent has evinced an intention no longer\n\n  to perform his obligations under the Deed and is in repudiatory breach thereof, and the\n\n  Claimant has suffered loss and damage. Alternatively, the Respondent has evinced an\n\n  intention to render substantially different performance from that envisaged under the\n\n  Deed, and is thereby in repudiatory breach thereof. On 29 November 2000, the Claimant\n\n  accepted the Respondent’s repudiation of the Deed.23. On 30 November 2000, after the Claimant accepted the\n\n  Respondent’s repudiatory breach of the Deed, the Respondent purported to appoint the\n\n  Claimant to the Board of JIL pursuant to clause 8 thereof. The Claimant says that this\n\n  \"appointment\" is ineffectual to restore the Deed.’",
        "INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS AND ORDERS": "25. On 8 February 2001, Suppiah’s solicitors filed an ex parte\n\nOriginating Summons No 600167 of 2001 (‘the OS’) for a Mareva Injunction Order\n\nagainst Borgensten pending the conclusion of the arbitration proceedings.26. The application sought to restrain Borgensten from removing his\n\nassets out of Singapore up to the value of $10m or from disposing or diminishing the value\n\nof his assets.27. The $10m figure was based on a figure of about $7.7m being the\n\nvalue attributed by Suppiah to his 30% shareholding in JIL which Borgensten was supposed\n\nto buy after the exercise of the Option by Suppiah. This value was based on a set of\n\naccounts prepared by JIPL’s auditors but not audited accounts.28. In addition, Suppiah was claiming a further $2m for breach of\n\nanother provision in the Deed, i.e Clause 7.2, under which Borgensten had agreed that if\n\nhe brought any action or proceeding in respect of any settled matter (as provided in\n\nClause 5.2 of the Deed), Suppiah would be entitled to exercise the Option at a certain\n\nprice plus $2m.29. At the same time the OS was filed, Suppiah’s solicitors also\n\nfiled an ex parte Summons-in-Chambers in the Writ action seeking similar injunctive relief\n\nbut in respect of the said $1m, interest and costs.30. The grounds of the applications were similar:(a) Borgensten’s failure to pay the said $1m for which there was a\n\n  judgment(b) Borgensten’s failure to comply with various EJD Orders(c) Borgensten’s alleged attempt to siphon RM9.8m from JIPL(d) Borgensten’s alleged refusal to appoint Suppiah to the board of directors of JIL,\n\n  in breach of the Deed(e) Borgensten’s alleged failure to prepare accurate accounts for JIL and its\n\n  subsidiaries, in breach of the Deed.31. Both applications were heard before Judicial Commissioner Lee Seiu\n\nKin on 8 February 2001 and he granted the reliefs sought. However, for the Mareva\n\nInjunction Order in the OS, he limited the figure to $5m. Mr Nair said that this was\n\napparently because Lee JC said that Suppiah had to give some credit for his shares since\n\nhe was not claiming the purchase price thereof but damages. However, Suppiah also had a\n\nclaim for $2m for breach of Clause 7.2 (see para 28 above).32. For the Mareva Injunction Order in the Writ action, the figure was\n\nlimited to $1.1m which included interest and costs.33. Paragraph 2 of each Mareva Injunction Order (‘MI Order’)\n\nrequired Borgensten to inform Suppiah in writing at once of all his assets, such\n\ninformation to be confirmed in an affidavit within 14 days after the MI Order is served on\n\nBorgensten.34. Furthermore, under each MI Order, Suppiah was granted leave to\n\nserve the MI Order by serving the same on Borgensten’s solicitors Gabriel Peter &\n\nPartners. The service was effected on the same day as the date of the MI Orders i.e 8\n\nFebruary 2001.",
        "APPLICATIONS TO APPOINT RECEIVERS AND APPLICATIONS FOR LEAVE TO APPLY FOR ORDERS OF\n\nCOMMITTAL": "35. Subsequently, Suppiah’s solicitors filed two similar\n\napplications in the OS and the Writ action on 14 March 2001 for the appointment of\n\nreceivers over the assets of Borgensten in aid of the MI Orders.36. The reason given was Borgensten’s failure to comply with\n\nParagraph 2 of the MI Orders.37. Furthermore, for the Writ action, Borgensten had failed to comply\n\nwith the four EJD Orders which I have already mentioned. He had also failed to comply with\n\na 5thEJD Order made on 13 February 2001 (after the two MI Orders).38. Under the 5thEJD Order, Borgensten was to file and\n\nserve an affidavit disclosing information and documents set out in a schedule and to\n\nattend personally at the next hearing on 27 February 2001 at 2.30 pm.39. His affidavit was not filed or served and he did not appear on 27\n\nFebruary 2001.40. According to Suppiah’s solicitors, an Assistant Registrar had\n\nat the 13 February 2001 hearing commented that Suppiah should consider instituting\n\ncontempt proceedings against Borgensten.41. On 15 March 2001, one day after the applications to appoint\n\nreceivers were filed, Suppiah’s solicitors filed ex parte applications in the OS and\n\nthe Writ action for leave to apply for an Order of Committal against Borgensten for his\n\nfailure to comply with Paragraph 2 of each of the MI Orders and, in addition for the Writ\n\naction, his failure to comply with various EJD Orders.42. The applications for leave came up for hearing before me on 23\n\nMarch 2001 and I granted leave to apply for Orders of Committal.43. The applications for appointment of receivers came up for hearing\n\nbefore me on 26 March 2001.44. Ms Diane The for Borgensten sought an adjournment of this hearing\n\non the basis that her firm had received instructions to set aside the MI Orders.\n\nBorgensten was said to be in Switzerland and she expected to have his affidavit for his\n\napplication filed within a week.45. Mr Suresh Nair for Suppiah objected to the application. He argued\n\nthat the MI Orders had been obtained, and served, on 8 February 2001 and yet Borgensten\n\nhad failed to comply with Paragraph 2 thereof since then.46. Furthermore, Borgensten had not applied to discharge the MI Orders\n\nand even as at the date of the hearing of the applications to appoint the receivers, he\n\nstill had not done so.47. Mr Nair also informed me that in the Writ action, he had just\n\nmanaged to obtain a garnishee order absolute earlier on the same morning i.e 26 March 2001\n\nin respect of Borgensten’s account with Credit Suisse for $1.06m which did not quite\n\ncover the entire judgment sum i.e principal, interest and costs.48. I refused the application for an adjournment and after hearing\n\narguments on the main applications, I made an order for an appointment of receivers in the\n\nOS action.49. As for the Writ action, I deferred my decision thereon to give\n\nBorgensten a chance to pay the shortfall of about $20,000 rather than incur the costs and\n\nexpense of a receivership for this relatively small sum.50. After a few weeks, Mr Nair confirmed that the shortfall had been\n\npaid. The application to appoint receivers in the Writ action therefore became academic\n\nand I made no order thereon in the Writ action. However the order appointing receivers in\n\nthe OS remained.51. In the meantime, on 4 April 2001, Suppiah applied in the OS and in\n\nthe Writ action for orders of committal to be made against Borgensten pursuant to the\n\nearlier orders granting leave to do so.",
        "BORGENSTEN’S APPLICATION TO SET ASIDE AN MI ORDER AND FOR OTHER RELIEF": "52. Before the applications for orders of committal were heard,\n\nBorgensten’s solicitors filed an application on 26 April 2001 in the OS for the\n\nfollowing relief:(a) To set aside the MI Order and for assessment of damages(b) Alternatively for the MI Order to be varied(c) For the Order appointing the Receivers to be set aside(d) That the Committal Proceedings commenced by Suppiah be set aside or stayed.No similar application was filed for the Writ action presumably because\n\nthe MI Order therein was no longer applicable as Suppiah had been paid the judgment sum.53. I should mention that the supporting affidavit for\n\nBorgensten’s application was signed on 24 April 2001, about one month after the\n\nhearing on 26 March 2001 for the appointment of receivers, and not within one week as had\n\nbeen represented to me when an adjournment of that hearing was being sought.54. Borgensten’s application to set aside the MI Order in the OS\n\nand for other relief was heard by me on 30 April 2001.55. One of the arguments made by Ms The for Borgensten was that there\n\nwas no valid cause of action. She argued that the injunction sought was ancillary to the\n\narbitration and that the arbitral tribunal did not have jurisdiction to determine the\n\nSpecified Price i.e the price at which Borgensten was supposed to buy Suppiah’s\n\nshares in JIL.56. Mr Nair countered by pointing out that Suppiah was not claiming the\n\nSpecified Price in the arbitration proceedings but damages as he had accepted the alleged\n\nrepudiation of the Deed by Borgensten.57. It should also be remembered that although the main claim by\n\nSuppiah was in relation to the sale of his shares in JIL, he also had another claim in\n\nrespect of Borgensten’s alleged breach in making a claim on matters which had been\n\nresolved.58. Clearly there were serious questions to be tried before the\n\ntribunal or Suppiah had a good arguable case, whichever test was adopted.59. I should also mention another point taken by Ms The. She said that\n\nBorgensten has 70% of the shares in JIL. If Suppiah’s 30% shareholding is worth $5m,\n\nwhich is the limit in the MI Order in the OS, then Borgensten’s 70% must be worth\n\nmore than $5m.60. I would reiterate that the $5m limit in the MI Order was not based\n\non the value of Suppiah’s 30% shareholding per se (see para 31 above).61. In any event, if Borgensten’s 70% shareholding is truly worth\n\nmore than $5m, then the MI Order should not prevent him from dealing with his other assets\n\nso long as (a) he is able to establish that that was the true value of his 70%\n\nshareholding at the time of service of the MI Order on him and (b) he does not do anything\n\nto deliberately diminish the value of the shares.62. If there is any uncertainty or dispute over this aspect of the MI\n\nOrder, it can be resolved by the court but that was not the dispute before me.63. I also note that the fifth and last line of paragraph 1(2) of the\n\nMI Order state that Borgensten may remove, dispose or deal with his assets so long as his\n\nassets remain ‘above’ S$5m. I think this is an error, probably arising from some\n\nstandard precedent as I have noticed a similar error arising in another case. It should\n\nread ‘not less than’ S$5m. The error should be corrected as soon as possible, if\n\nthis has not already been done.64. The real thrust of Borgensten’s application was that there was\n\nno real risk of dissipation by him of his assets pending the hearing before the tribunal.\n\nFor this, he responded to the various grounds relied on by Suppiah for the MI Order.",
        "Failure to pay the said $1m and the EJD Orders": "65. Borgensten said he could not attend court on the first appointed\n\ndate of 5 December 2000 as he had to attend to urgent matters in the Bahamas where Suppiah\n\nhad filed a winding up petition on 8 November 2000 to wind up JIL.66. In relation to the 5/12/00 and 2ndEJD Order, he said he\n\nknew he would not be complying with it. That is why he had instructed his solicitors to\n\nfile an application for an extension of time with a supporting affidavit from his\n\nsolicitor Diana The. One of the reasons given in the supporting affidavit was that he was\n\nunwell. This was supported by a medical certificate dated 19 December 2000 from Dr Med\n\nH.R. Walder. It said:‘Medical certificateI hereby certify, that Mr. Curt Borgensten came to my office\n\n  urgently on Dec 18 2000 due to acute illness.He is incapable of working and travelling and therefore he can not fly\n\n  to Asia at the beginning of the coming year as planned.The incapacity of travelling will last most probably for 3 to 4 weeks.Mr Borgensten could not foresee this illness at the time of booking his\n\n  flight to Asia.’67. Borgensten also claimed that on 16 January 2001, he had credited\n\nUS$564,272.88 into his US dollar account with Credit Suisse in Singapore and this was\n\nconverted into S$981,463.55 and credited into his Singapore dollar account with Credit\n\nSuisse on 23 January 2001. On 6 February 2001, an additional amount of S$73,000 was\n\ncredited into his Singapore dollar account. The total was about S$1,055,000. He said this\n\nwas remitted to satisfy the judgment (in the Writ action for the said S$1m, interest and\n\ncosts) and this was contrary to any allegation of dissipating his assets.68. Mr Nair pointed out that the medical certificate was wanting. There\n\nwas no elaboration of the mysterious ‘acute illness’ that Borgensten was\n\nsupposed to have been suffering.69. Furthermore, there was still no explanation for Borgensten’s\n\nfailure to comply with the 3rdand 4thEJD Orders and the subsequent\n\n5thEJD Order.70. As regards the alleged crediting of US$564,272.88 by Borgensten, Mr\n\nNair referred to a 16 January 2001 notification from HL Bank to Borgensten. The last\n\nsentence reads, ‘The balance of USD564,272.88 is remitted to Bank of New York, New\n\nYork for the account of Credit Suisse Private Bank, Singapore Branch favouring yourselves\n\naccount number 5013’.71. Mr Nair submitted that this demonstrated that the monies were not\n\nremitted to Singapore.72. Mr Nair also submitted that even if the monies were remitted to\n\nSingapore, Suppiah was not informed of this. Suppiah had to initiate various steps to\n\nobtain payment.73. I accepted Mr Nair’s arguments.74. I noted that Borgensten could easily have produced a document from\n\nCredit Suisse in Singapore to confirm that the US$564,272.88 had been remitted to\n\nSingapore if this was indeed the case.75. Furthermore, even if indeed this was the case, Borgensten was aware\n\nthat Suppiah had been compelled to take step after step to try and recover the judgment\n\nsum. If Borgensten’s intention was really to use the monies to pay Suppiah, he would\n\nhave told his solicitors to inform Suppiah’s solicitors accordingly so that it would\n\nbe unnecessary for the latter to continue taking so many steps.76. It was the good fortune of Suppiah to have managed to garnish the\n\nmonies in the account with Credit Suisse later. From the records, the Garnishee Order Nisi\n\nwas obtained on 14 March 2001 only. Also, as I have mentioned, the monies garnished still\n\nleft a shortfall as there was interest and costs to be paid. In my view, Borgensten had\n\nnever intended the monies to pay the judgment sum. Yet when the monies were garnished, he\n\nsought to turn this around to his advantage by saying that the monies were intended to pay\n\nthe judgment sum.",
        "Attempt to siphon RM9.8m from JIPL": "77. According to Borgensten, he had not attempted to siphon monies from\n\nJIPL.78. In 1997, JIPL sold 50% of its subsidiary Johnson Industries\n\nHoldings AG to a Finnish company for RM27.7m. Of the sale proceeds, RM9.8m was transferred\n\nto Johnson Coating Invest AG (‘JCI’) a Swiss company and RM4m was transferred to\n\nThird Heritage Sdn Bhd. The balance was transferred to JIPL.79. Borgensten was obviously aware hat JCI had no interest or right to\n\nthe RM9.8m. He did not dispute that he was the holder of 48 out of 50 shares in JCI.80. However he claimed that actually the RM9.8m was a loan from JIPL\n\n(the vendor of the shares) to JIL (the Bahamas company and parent of JIPL) and from JIL to\n\nJCI. He claimed that Suppiah was in charge of finance in JIPL and should have seen to it\n\nthat the books of JIPL had been properly kept.81. It appeared that there was no contemporaneous record in JIPL or JIL\n\nor JCI to show the reason why RM9.8m had ended up in JCI.82. Borgensten also said that the alleged loan was eventually repaid,\n\nif not entirely, then substantially.83. Much time was spent to demonstrate that most of the alleged loan\n\nwas eventually paid. However it did not address the point as to why JIPL should go about\n\nmaking a loan in the first place and why in the indirect manner alleged by Borgensten i.e\n\nfrom JIPL to JIL and then from JIL to JCI instead of from JIPL to JCI directly.84. The fact that the alleged loan was eventually substantially repaid\n\ndid not address the questionable circumstances surrounding the loan in the first place. It\n\nmay have been that something more sinister was intended and then reversed on the\n\ntransaction being uncovered or it may all have been innocent. However the matter was not\n\nas straightforward as Borgensten was suggesting.",
        "The appointment of Suppiah as director of JIL": "85. Borgensten alleged that he had never refused to appoint Suppiah as\n\ndirector of JIL, which appointment he was required to do under the Deed. He claimed that\n\nhe was in the process of arranging the appointment of Suppiah but he was involved in an\n\nextensive overseas business trip and as such could not attend to the matters raised in the\n\nletters from Suppiah’s solicitors.86. He also claimed that a more important reason why he was hesitant to\n\nappoint Suppiah as a director was because he had discovered that Suppiah had been acting\n\nagainst the interests of JIL and JIPL in matters of a subsidiary of JIPL. This concern was\n\nraised by his solicitors in a letter dated 26 November 2000.87. I did not accept these explanations.88. Allen & Gledhill, acting for Suppiah, had requested Borgensten\n\nto, inter alia, appoint Suppiah to the board of JIL in their fax/letter dated 24 August\n\n2000 and forwarded a written resolution to this effect for Borgensten’s signature.\n\nGabriel Peter & Partners responded on 28 August 2000 to say that Borgensten was\n\narranging for this to be done.89. When Allen & Gledhill chased for this to be done, Gabriel Peter\n\n& Partners responded on 14 September 2000 and gave the same excuse.90. After some more chasers from Allen & Gledhill, Gabriel Peter\n\n& Partners responded on 20 November 2000 to say for the first time that Borgensten was\n\n‘at the moment involved in an extensive overseas business trip’. This was almost\n\nthree months after the request was first made by Allen & Gledhill on 24 August 2000.91. In Gabriel Peter & Partners’ fax dated 26 November 2000,\n\nthey then raised also for the first time the allegation that Suppiah had not acted in the\n\ninterest of JIL and JIPL and said that Borgensten would be seeking redress and\n\n‘cannot in the meantime appoint your client as a director in JIL’.92. In response, Allen & Gledhill replied on 29 November 2000 and\n\ntreated Borgensten as repudiating the Deed in view of (a) his failure to pay the said $1m\n\nat that time, (b) his failure to appoint Suppiah as a director of JIL and other alleged\n\nbreaches.93. Significantly, Borgensten then signed a resolution dated 30\n\nNovember 2000 to appoint Suppiah as a director of JIL notwithstanding the excuse that\n\nSuppiah had not been acting in the interests of JIL and JIPL.94. There was yet another point. Although Borgensten was too busy to\n\nappoint Suppiah as a director of JIL, he had no difficulty in arranging for the\n\nappointment of one Stephen Buhrer to the board of JIL on or about 5 September 2000 (see\n\npara 8 of Suppiah’s 1staffidavit in the OS).95. The above facts speak for themselves.",
        "Accounts of JIL and JIPL": "96. Under Clause 10.1.2 of the Deed, Suppiah and Borgensten were\n\nobliged to:(a) Use all endeavours to finalise the accounts of JIL for the year\n\n  ending March 2000 as soon as possible,(b) Take all necessary steps to ensure that JIL and JIPL provide all\n\n  directors in JIL and JIPL with quarterly management accounts, such accounts to be provided\n\n  within 90 days of the expiry of such quarter, with the first quarter being the quarter\n\n  commencing 1 April 2000.In addition, Borgensten was obliged to:(c) Take all necessary steps to ensure that the unaudited accounts of\n\n  JIL and JIPL shall be made available to all directors of JIL and JIPL within 90 days of\n\n  the closing of the financial year, and(d) Ensure that each of the directors gets a copy of the audited\n\n  accounts of JIL and JIPL within 14 days of the audited accounts being made available.97. Suppiah had alleged that Borgensten had breached all these\n\nobligations.98. Borgensten said that JIPL’s accounts were messy. Suppiah was\n\naware of this as he was the Group Financial Officer at the material time. JIL’s\n\naccounts could not be finalised until JIPL’s accounts were finalised.99. Furthermore, he claimed he had appointed a Swiss firm of\n\naccountants Juris Treuhand AG and Ernst & Young to audit the books of JIL even though\n\nJIPL’s accounts had not yet been finalised.100. He also claimed that, as at 6 April 2001, there was some problem\n\nin getting the March 1999 accounts of JIPL finalised apparently because of some\n\ndifferences about the payment of audit fees.101. I did not reach any tentative conclusion on Suppiah’s\n\nallegation on this issue at the stage of the hearing before me.102. However, Suppiah had also complained that Borgensten was in breach\n\nof Clause 11 of the Deed (see para 6 above) by refusing to supply him with the name of\n\nJIL’s auditors, which he had requested to move things along, until after Suppiah had\n\ncommenced winding up proceedings in the Bahamas. There was some merit in this complaint\n\nand Borgensten’s omission did not reflect well on him.103. Ms The argued that even if Borgensten had failed to appoint\n\nSuppiah as a director of JIL and had failed to provide accounts, such conduct did not\n\ndemonstrate that Borgensten was likely to dissipate his assets to avoid an award against\n\nhim.",
        "General": "140. Ms The relied heavily on the case ofHeng Holdings SEA (Pte)\n\nLtd v Tomongo Shipping Co Ltd[1997] 3 SLR 547(‘Heng Holdings’).105. In that case, the question arose whether there was evidence or\n\nsufficient evidence that the defendants would dissipate or at least were likely to\n\ndissipate their assets so as to defeat or frustrate the realization of a judgment that the\n\nplaintiffs might eventually obtain against them.106. At paras 48 to 50, L P Thean JA said:‘ 48. The learned judge in refusing to set aside the Mareva\n\n  injunction said:In considering whether there is a risk of dissipation of assets, the\n\n    court is entitled to take into consideration the past conduct of the defendants. In this\n\n    case, there was first, the fact that the defendants had not been forthcoming at all in\n\n    responding to the plaintiffs’ claim. They had largely ignored it. There was then the\n\n    history of their defaults in discharging their debts. There had been instances when they\n\n    paid up only when execution proceedings had been taken against them. So far as their\n\n    accounts are concerned, they do show the company as owning substantial fixed assets, but\n\n    most of these assets have been mortgaged to secure overdraft and other facilities. What is\n\n    of particular interest are receivables in substantial amounts shown as due from the\n\n    holding company (nearly $9m) and ‘related parties’ (nearly $6.4m). These\n\n    receivables are noted in the accounts as unsecured, interest-free and with no fixed term\n\n    of payment. Such financial practices of the defendants are in my view particularly\n\n    relevant when considering the question of risk of dissipation.49. With great respect, we are unable to agree with the learned judge.\n\n  First, the fact that the appellants had largely ignored the respondents’ claim does\n\n  not show that a judgment in favour of the respondents would not eventually be satisfied.\n\n  We agree that the appellants had not been prompt in responding to the claim. The evidence\n\n  suggests that the appellants were aware of the claim as early as November 1995 and they\n\n  appeared to have done nothing to settle the claim or discharge their obligations under the\n\n  indemnity. The only replies the respondents obtained from them before the action was\n\n  commenced were the two faxes in September 1996 stating that the appellants were not in a\n\n  position to put up security and that the respondents should proceed to do so themselves.\n\n  However, we are unable to infer from the mere fact that the appellants were\n\n  uncommunicative and reluctant to fulfill their contractual obligations that they would\n\n  dissipate their assets so as to prevent a judgment obtained against them from being\n\n  satisfied.50. The same is true of the second reason given by the learned judge,\n\n  namely, the past instances when the appellants’ creditors had to resort to execution\n\n  proceedings against them to recover payment of their debts. The respondents had shown\n\n  various instances where the appellants had failed or refused to pay and discharge their\n\n  debts or liabilities until their creditors put in force execution proceedings. All these,\n\n  of course, do not speak well of the appellants and show undoubtedly that they are very bad\n\n  paymasters, and that they are in a habit of not paying or refusing to pay their debts,\n\n  until the bailiff is at their doorsteps with the writs of execution. Nonetheless, all\n\n  these facts do not give rise to an inference that the appellants would dissipate or were\n\n  likely to dissipate their assets so as to frustrate any judgment in favour of the\n\n  respondents.’107. However there were other factors in that case. At paras 46 to 47,\n\nThean LA said:‘ 46. The appellants’ main contention before us is that the\n\n  respondents had not shown that there was a real risk of dissipation of assets by the\n\n  appellants. The appellants had taken no action at any time to dissipate any of their\n\n  assets. On the contrary, they had made a further major investment in the course of their\n\n  business by acquiring some shophouses in McKenzie Road at a price of S$10.7m for\n\n  redevelopment in mid-1996. They relied on their audited accounts for the financial year\n\n  ending 30 September 1995 which showed that their financial position was sound. The audited\n\n  balance sheet showed their fixed assets having a value of about S$24m, which included a\n\n  six-storey building in Bukit Timah Road called Tong Nam Building. The balance sheet also\n\n  showed their current assets with a value of over S$15m, against their current liabilities\n\n  to the extent of over S$12m and non-current liabilities of over S$2m. It was therefore\n\n  argued that they clearly had sufficient assets to satisfy the respondents’ claim of\n\n  S$1.3m. They explained that they had been slow in satisfying the claim and in providing\n\n  substituted security because their existing bank lines had been fully utilised and they\n\n  needed time to negotiate fresh lines of credit.47. We agree with this submission. On the evidence, the appellants are\n\n  a company with substantial fixed assets and they appeared to be carrying on business in\n\n  the normal way. There was no evidence of any real risk that the appellants’ assets\n\n  would be dissipated or were likely to be dissipated such that a judgment obtained against\n\n  them would go unsatisfied.’108. InChoy Chee Keen Collin v Public Utilities Board[1997] 1 SLR 604, Thean JA said at paras 20 and 21:‘ 20. InThe Niedersachsen; Ninemia Maritime Corp v Trave\n\n  Schiffahrtsgesselschaft mbH & Co KG[1984] 1 All ER 398, Mustill J, whose judgment\n\n  at first instance was upheld on appeal, held that the plaintiff would have to adduce\n\n  ‘solid evidence’ to support his assertions of a real risk of dissipation. He\n\n  said, at p 406:It is not enough for the plaintiff to assert a risk that the assets\n\n  will be dissipated. He must demonstrate this by solid evidence. This evidence may take a\n\n  number of different forms. It may consist of direct evidence that the defendant has\n\n  previously acted in a way which shows that his probity is not to be relied on. Or the\n\n  plaintiff may show what type of company the defendant is (where it is incorporated, what\n\n  are its corporate structure and assets, and so on) so as to raise an inference that the\n\n  company is not to be relied on. Or again, the plaintiff may be able to found his case on\n\n  the fact that inquiries about the characteristics of the defendant have led to a blank\n\n  wall. Precisely what form the evidence may take will depend on the particular\n\n  circumstances of the case. But the evidence must always be there.21. At the minimum, a plaintiff in seeking a Mareva injunction must\n\n  furnish ‘some grounds for believing that there is a risk’ of the assets being\n\n  dissipated (per Lai Kew Chai J inArt Trend Ltd v Blue Dolphin (Pte) Ltd[1983] 1 MLJ 25at p 29;[1982-1983] SLR 362at p 367). A mere possibility or unsupported fear of\n\n  dissipation is insufficient:O’Regan & Ors v Iambic Productions Ltd(1989)\n\n  139 NLJ 1378, at p 1379 where Sir Peter Pain said:There are numerous paragraphs in the authorities relating to Mareva\n\n    injunctions which make it plain that unsupported statements and expressions of fear carry\n\n    very little, if any, weight. The court needs to act on objective facts from which the\n\n    court can infer that the defendant is likely to move assets abroad or dissipate them\n\n    within the jurisdiction. Here, there is nothing of that nature in the documents at all\n\n    …’109. The facts before me were quite different from those inHeng\n\nHoldings.110. First, Borgensten is a Swedish national resident in Switzerland.\n\nAt the time of the application for the MI Orders, Suppiah believed Borgensten had a\n\nresidential property in Sweden and possibly in Switzerland as well as shares in JIL, JCI\n\nand German companies. Also, Borgensten was supposed to have an account with HSBC in\n\nSingapore.111. It is now known that he also has an account with Credit Suisse in\n\nSingapore.112. The whereabouts of the real properties were unknown. Also, the\n\ntrue values of these real properties and of the shareholdings were unknown and the amount\n\nin the HSBC account was also unknown.113. Furthermore, the situation was not confined to Borgensten’s\n\nfailure to pay the judgment sum in the Writ action.114. He had failed to comply with five EJD Orders.115. He gave a lame excuse about his acute illness in respect of\n\nnon-compliance with the 5/12/00 and 2ndEJD Order.116. He did not give any reason at the material time for his\n\nnon-compliance with the 3rdto 5thEJD Orders. He sought to explain\n\nthis away by saying that he had remitted monies to Singapore to pay the judgment sum which\n\nexplanation I did not accept.117. He had failed to comply with Paragraph 2 of each of the MI Orders\n\nrequiring him to disclose his assets.118. The circumstances regarding the alleged loan of RM9.8m to JCI were\n\nquestionable.119. He had failed to appoint Suppiah as a director of JIL in breach of\n\nhis obligation under the Deed. Worse still, he gave false excuse after false excuse for\n\nthis failure.120. He had failed to co-operate with Suppiah by providing the names of\n\nJIL’s auditors when initially requested.121. In my view, the evidence taken together was solid evidence that\n\nBorgensten’s probity was not to be relied on and that there was a real risk that he\n\nwould dissipate his assets to thwart any judgment or award that Suppiah might obtain. The\n\nsteps taken against him were the result of his recalcitrance and not to pressurise him\n\nunfairly.122. Accordingly, I dismissed Borgensten’s application to set\n\naside the MI Order in the OS and for other relief. It is this decision which Borgensten\n\nhas appealed against.",
        "APPLICATION TO RESTRAIN BORGENSTEN FROM LEAVING SINGAPORE": "123. On 27 April 2001, Suppiah applied for the following main orders:‘1. The Defendant be restrained from leaving Singapore until:(a) he complies with Order 2 of the Order of Court herein dated 8\n\n    February 2001; and(b) he delivers to the Receivers, Messrs Ong Yew Huat and Nagaraj\n\n    Sivaram, all documents of title to all shares held legally and/or beneficially by the\n\n    Defendant in Johnson Industries Limited and Johnson Coating Invest AG; and(c) he has been examined by the Receivers as to his assets;2. That he do forthwith delivered (sic) up his passport to the\n\n  Sheriff who shall serve this order upon him provided that the Sheriff shall return his\n\n  passport to him upon his compliance with the foregoing.’124. The application was heard before Lee JC the same day and the main\n\norders sought were made and subsequently executed.",
        "HEARING OF APPLICATIONS FOR COMMITTAL ORDERS": "125. The first hearing of the applications for committal orders was on\n\n8 May 2001.126. Borgensten took the witness stand to explain why he had failed to\n\ncomply with the EJD Orders and the MI Orders. His evidence did not assist him.127. Mr Gabriel submitted, inter alia, that the Receivers had given\n\nBorgensten up to 7 May 2001 to provide his affidavit on his assets and he had replied to\n\nsay it would be provided by 9 May 2001.128. Mr Nair submitted, inter alia, that the only reason why Borgensten\n\nwas filing his affidavit was because he had surrendered his passports pursuant to the 27\n\nApril 2001 Order. Also an affidavit from him on his assets did not cure past breaches.129. I adjourned the hearing to 2.15 pm of 10 May 2001 to see if the\n\npromised affidavit on assets would be filed by 9 May 2001. It was done but the affidavit\n\nappeared to be on Borgensten’s current assets and not as at the date of service of\n\nthe MI Orders i.e 8 February 2001.130. At the resumed hearing on 10 May 2001, Mr Gabriel submitted that\n\nthere was no material change in Borgensten’s assets since 8 February 2001 and\n\nundertook on Borgensten’s behalf that another affidavit would be filed by 14 May 2001\n\n4 pm to state his assets as at the date of service of the MI Orders. This was subsequently\n\ndone.131. I imposed a fine of $10,000 on Borgensten for the application in\n\nthe Writ action. I took into account, inter alia, his failure to comply with five EJD\n\nOrders and Paragraph 2 of the MI Order but, on the other hand, I also took into account\n\nthat Suppiah had been fully paid his judgment sum by the time the application for\n\ncommittal was heard by me.132. For the application in the OS, I imposed a fine of $20,000 as\n\nBorgensten had been in clear breach of Paragraph 2 of the MI Order pending the\n\ndetermination of the substantive disputes. If not for his eleventh hour affidavit on his\n\nassets, he ran the risk of an order of committal being made against him.",
        "FURTHER ARGUMENTS ON BORGENSTEN’S APPLICATION TO DISCHARGE THE MI ORDERS": "133. Peter Gabriel & Partners subsequently requested further\n\narguments on Borgensten’s application to set aside the MI order in the OS and for\n\nother relief. I granted the request and further arguments were heard on 1 June 2001.134. The main purpose of the further arguments was to refer to a set of\n\naudited accounts of JIPL for the financial year ending 31 March 1998 which were signed by\n\nSuppiah and another director of JIPL.135. Mr Gabriel, who appeared with Ms The for Borgensten at this\n\nhearing, argued that by signing the audited accounts, Suppiah had accepted the accounts\n\nwhich showed no money owing to JIPL by JCI. Hence Suppiah could not complain about the\n\nsiphoning of monies by Borgensten from JIPL to JCI.136. However the accounts were qualified by the auditors. Paragraph 3\n\nof the auditors’ report states:‘3. The balance sheets of the Company and the Group included an\n\n  amount due by the holding corporation amounting to $10,844,000 and $10,887,000\n\n  respectively as at 31 March 1998. These balances included a transfer of an amount owing by\n\n  a related party corporation of $8,377,000. We were unable to independently ascertain the\n\n  validity of this transfer. In addition, there is no available audited financial statements\n\n  for us to assess the financial strength of the holding corporation. As mentioned in note\n\n  13 to the financial statements, subsequent to 31 March 1998, an amount of $2,380,000 was\n\n  received by the Company and the holding corporation also made payments on behalf of the\n\n  Company amounting to $758,466. Due to the complexity of the transfers of balances giving\n\n  rise to the outstanding balance and due to the inadequate documentary evidence to support\n\n  the subsequent transactions refer (sic) to in note 13, there were no practicable\n\n  audit procedures we could carry out to obtain satisfactory assurance as to the validity\n\n  and recoverability of the balance owing by the holding corporation. Consequently, we were\n\n  not able to satisfy ourselves as to the validity of the transfer of $8,377,000 from the\n\n  related party corporation to the holding corporation and the full recoverability of the\n\n  balance of $10,844,000 and $10,877,000 due by the holding corporation to the Company and\n\n  to the Group, respectively.’137. In my view, the accounts with the auditors’ qualification\n\ngave rise to more questions than answers.138. By signing the accounts, Suppiah did not necessarily accept\n\nBorgensten’s position.139. Furthermore, Mr Nair pointed out (in his written response to the\n\nrequest for further arguments) that developments since my decision on 30 April 2001\n\nrevealed yet another illustration of the lack of probity on Borgensten’s part.140. In Borgensten’s 2ndaffidavit filed on 1 November\n\n2000 in the Writ action, he had referred to a claim by him against Suppiah for a property\n\nin Malaysia. He said, ‘… At the end of the day, it is without a doubt that the\n\nProperty was beneficially owned by me’.141. Yet when Borgensten eventually filed his affidavit of assets in\n\nthe OS on 9 May 2001, he said of that property, ‘The Plaintiff is holding the\n\nproperty on trust for me and in turn, I hold the said property in trust for Johnson\n\nIndustries Pte Ltd’.142. Mr Gabriel did not even venture any explanation for this\n\ncontradiction.143. It was clear to me that Borgensten had done an about-turn yet\n\nagain.144. In the circumstances, I affirmed my earlier decision.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
