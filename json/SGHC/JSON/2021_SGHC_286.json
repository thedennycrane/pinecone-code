        "The parties": "1 The 1st plaintiff, Nishiki Holdings Pte Ltd (“NH”), is a company incorporated in Singapore. NH is a holding company. Dr Masami Yabumoto (“Dr Yabumoto”) is the 100% beneficial owner of NH. At the time of the “Sale Leaseback Transaction” mentioned below, NH was 50% owned by Dr Yabumoto and 50% owned by a Medical Charitable Trust.1Foot Note 1×Eve Lee’s AEIC dated 21 June 2021 (“Eve Lee’s AEIC”) at pp 54 and 57 and 1st Defendant’s Closing Submissions (“1DCS”) at para 7(b)(i).Presently, Dr Yabumoto and Ms Zhang Ran (“Ms Zhang”) are equal shareholders of NH, with Ms Zhang holding on behalf of Dr Yabumoto.2Foot Note 2×Zhang Ran’s AEIC dated 21 June 2021 (“Zhang Ran’s AEIC”) at para 10.The 2nd plaintiff, Nishiki Real Estate Pte Ltd (“NRE”), is also a company incorporated in Singapore and is a holding company. NH is the ordinary shareholder of NRE. The 3rd plaintiff, Nishiki International Investments Pte Ltd (“NII”), is also a company incorporated in Singapore and a holding company. NII is a wholly owned subsidiary of NH. 2 The 1st defendant, Sankaty European Investments S.A.R.L (“Sankaty”) is a private limited company incorporated in Luxembourg. Sankaty is part of the debt division of Bain Capital LP. Sankaty was later renamed Bain Capital Credit. 3 The 1st defendant demanded from the plaintiffs, payment of “Additional Interest” arising from a loan agreement entered into between the parties (“Loan Agreement”). Flowing from the alleged debt for “Additional Interest”, the 1st defendant also appointed the 2nd and 3rd defendants, Mr Sajjad Ahmad Akhtar (“Mr Akhtar”) and Mr Chin Sek Peng Michael (from PKF-CAP Advisory Partners Pte Ltd), as private receivers over certain assets of the plaintiffs. 4 In this suit, the plaintiffs sought in the main, to set aside the Loan Agreement and in particular, the “Additional Interest” provisions of the Loan Agreement, on the ground that the 1st defendant was put on notice regarding a certain conflict of interest. In the alternative, they sought to set aside the appointment of the appraiser, Houlihan Lokey (China) Limited (“HL China”), whom the 1st defendant had appointed to value certain assets. HL China’s valuation formed the basis for the computation of the “Additional Interest”. I find that the Loan Agreement was valid, but the appointment of HL China as the appraiser was not valid. I set out my reasons below.",
        "Background facts": "5 The Kinshukai Medical Corporation (“KMC”) is a large healthcare provider in Japan, with substantial holdings of hospitals in Osaka. The controlling shareholder of KMC is Dr Yabumoto. Sometime in or about the middle of 2016, KMC restructured its corporate structure. In particular, ownership of KMC’s nine Osaka medical properties (the “Properties”) were transferred to a Japanese special purpose company called Nishiki Tokutei Mokuteki Kaisha (“Nishiki TMK”). Nishiki TMK is wholly owned by NRE. 6 KMC and Nishiki TMK entered into a transaction, whereby KMC would sell the Properties to Nishiki TMK, who would lease the properties back to KMC (“Sale Leaseback Transaction”). Nishiki TMK had to raise senior, mezzanine, and equity financing to finance the purchase of properties from KMC. The senior financing to Nishiki TMK was provided by Deutsche Bank Tokyo (“DB Tokyo”) and United Overseas Bank Tokyo (“UOB Tokyo”). This was to serve as bridge financing until Nikishi TMK sold the Properties to third party investors. The 1st defendant was involved in funding DB Tokyo for DB Tokyo’s mezzanine financing to Nishiki TMK at JPY6.9bn and providing a principal loan of JPY100m to NRE pursuant to the Loan Agreement. 7 The Loan Agreement was entered into by the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant. It was concluded on the plaintiffs’ behalf by Mr Theodore Meegan (“Mr Meegan”). Mr Meegan was the sole director of NH and NRE from June 2016 to on or about 23 October 2018. He was the sole director of NII from 12 October 2015 to on or about 23 October 2018. 8 Under cl 2 of the Loan Agreement, the 1st defendant would advance JPY100m to NRE (the “Loan”). Clause 6.1 provided that the Loan was repayable in full by the “Maturity Date”. Clause 8.1 of the Loan Agreement provided that “Fixed Interest” would accrue on the outstanding principal amount of the Loan at the rate of 10% per annum. In or about July 2016, the 1st defendant advanced the Loan to NRE. About one year later, on or about 29 June 2017, NRE repaid the Loan and the accrued Fixed Interest in full. 9 Around 18 December 2017, Mr Meegan, with the assistance of Ms Zhang, who was then the plaintiffs’ office manager and secretary to Mr Meegan, emailed Dr Yabumoto to inform him that there were covenants with the 1st defendant that remained until equity exit, including a component for “Additional Interest”. Dr Yabumoto replied by email on 18 December 2017 that he did not know of such a covenant and asked to be informed of the conditions to be released from the covenant effectively. 10 This covenant relating to “Additional Interest” is set out in cl 8.2 of the Loan Agreement, which provides that upon the occurrence of certain events specified in cl 8.2(a), the Plaintiffs would be obliged to pay the 1st defendant a component termed “Additional Interest” (the “Additional Interest”). It is the 1st defendant’s contention that the Additional Interest is compensation for the 1st defendant’s provision of the funding for the mezzanine financing that was fronted by DB Tokyo. Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement sets out the mechanism to calculate the quantum of Additional Interest. The relevant clauses from the Loan Agreement and Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement states: [The Loan Agreement:] 8.2 Additional Interest Payment (a) In addition to the interest payments contemplated under Clause 8.1, the Borrowers shall pay to the Lender, as additional interest on the Loan, the Additional Interest Amount at the following time: … (ii) on the acceleration of the Loan pursuant to Clause 19.16 (Acceleration) or the Maturity Date, or, at the election of the Lender (in its sole discretion), at such later date as may be specified by the Lender to the Borrower Agent (subject to clause (iii) below) … [Schedule 1:] 1. Exit. (a) Upon the occurrence of an Exit, the Borrowers shall cause the Exit Proceed to be used to pay the following amounts in the following order of priority: (i)first, by Nishiki TMK to pay all outstanding Nishiki TMK Financing Obligations; (ii)second,to the extent that Exit Proceeds are received by Nishiki TMK, by Nishiki TMK to pay all Preferred Equity and TK Distributions; (iii)third, to pay the aggregate amount of Approved Operating Expenses then due and payable by NRE and NII; (iv)fourth, to pay the Lender all accrued and unpaid Fixed Interest and any fees, costs and expenses the due to the Lender; (v)fifth,to pay the Lender the aggregate amount sufficient to repay in full all then-outstanding principal (including capitalized interest) of the Loan on and as of the date of such payment; (vi)sixth,to make a distribution to the Preferred Shareholder in the amount of the Preferred Shareholder Investment Amount plus any accrued and unpaid fixed distributions (not to exceed 10% of the Preferred Shareholder Investment Amount); (vii)seventh, to pay to KMC the deferred payment amount incurred by Nishiki TMK in connection with the Sale Leaseback Transaction in the amount of JPY 1.256 billion, plus accrued interest at 1% per annum; (viii)eighth,to make a distribution to Holdings in an amount equal to JPY 1.425 billion; and (ix)ninth, to pay the Lender and the Preferred Shareholder an aggregate amount equal to 20% of the amount equal to the (A) the Exit Proceedsminus(B) the sum of the amounts under items (i) through (vii) above, such that the ratio of such payment to the Lender and the Preferred Shareholder is 93.103:6.897 (such amount determined to be payable to the Lender under this item, the “Additional Interest Amount”). Thereafter, any remaining amounts can be used to make distributions to Holdings or as the Borrowers otherwise see fit. … 3. Definitions … (c) “Exit Proceeds” means: … [(v)] in the event that payment of the Additional Interest Amount is due to the Lender pursuant to Clause 8.2 of the main body of this Agreement prior to the occurrence of an Exit, the fair market value of all of Nishiki TMK’s assets, including the Properties (as determined, in the case of non-cash assets, by an Appraiser). [emphasis in original] 11 Under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement, read with cl 20 of the Loan Agreement (which defines “Borrower Agent” as NRE):3Foot Note 3×Takeyuki Matsuda’s AEIC dated 23 June 2021 (“Matsuda’s AEIC”) at para 87. (a) The first step was to ascertain the quantum of “Exit Proceeds”, which is defined in paragraph 3(c)(iv) [sic] of Schedule 1 as: “the fair market value of all ofNishiki TMK’s assets, including the Properties (as determined, in the case of non-cash assets, by an Appraiser).” (b) “Appraiser” was defined by Paragraph 3(a) of Schedule 1 as “a reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan appointed by[the 1st defendant]in consultation with[the Borrower Agent,ie, NRE, pursuant to Cl 20 of the Loan Agreement].” (c) The next step was to take the Exit Proceeds and use it to pay the amounts to various parties in the order of priority stated at paragraph 1(a)(i) to (viii) of Schedule 1. (d) Thereafter, [under paragraph 1(a)(ix) of Schedule 1,] the remainder was to be used to pay [the 1st defendant] and Brocade Investment “an aggregate amount equal to 20% of the amount equal to the (A) the Exit Proceeds minus (B) the sum of the amounts under items (i) through (vii) above,such that the ratio of such payment to[the1st defendant]and Brocade Investment is 93.103 : 6.897”... [emphasis in original] 12 Clause 8.2(a)(ii) of the Loan Agreement stated that the Additional Interest would be payable,inter alia, on the “Maturity Date”. The original Maturity Date was 30 June 2018. The Maturity Date was amended six times. At the final amendment, the Maturity Date was 30 November 2018. 13 On 23 October 2018, Mr Meegan was dismissed as sole director of the plaintiffs. 14 On or about 4 December 2018, the 1st defendant emailed to the plaintiffs, a “Demand for Payment of Additional Interest Amount”. The email was sent to Mr Meegan, Mr Shinsuke Kataoka (“Mr Kataoka”) and Ms Zhang, but only Mr Kataoka received the email. Mr Kataoka was a consultant hired by Mr Meegan to assist in the financing for the Sale Leaseback transaction. Ms Zhang testified that her email was deactivated at that time. 15 On 5 December 2018, Ms Eve Lee (“Ms Lee”) of the 1st defendant wrote to Mr Kataoka suggesting the appointment of one of the following three firms as the Appraiser for the purposes of the valuation under Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement: “Houlihan Lokey”, “PWC”, and “Deloitte”. Mr Kataoka replied by email on the same day to say that he had no objection to either “Houlihan” or “PWC”, “assuming they do a fair valuation”. 16 The 1st defendant appointed HL China on 6 February 2019 as the Appraiser. HL China subsequently subcontracted the entirety of the work of determining the fair market value of the Properties to Enrix Co Ltd (“Enrix”). For its report, HL China relied on Enrix’s valuation of the Properties, which was JPY28.601bn. 17 On or about 12 July 2019, the 1st defendant wrote a letter of demand to the plaintiffs. The 1st defendant quantified the Additional Interest at JPY1.111bn, based on a valuation report issued by HL China in March 2019 (the “HL China Valuation Report”). 18 On or about 27 September 2019, the plaintiffs’ representative, Mr Takeyuki Matsuda (“Matsuda”), met with the 1st defendant’s representative, Mr Tetsuji Okamoto (“Mr Okamoto”). The plaintiffs’ case is that Mr Okamoto agreed that all parties refrain from taking any legal or enforcement action pending the plaintiffs’ appointment of a third-party appraisal firm to review the HL China Valuation Report. The 1st defendant’s case is that Mr Okamoto had consistently maintained that while the plaintiffs could be given more time to conduct their own internal checks, the Additional Interest of JPY1.111bn would not be compromised. 19 On or about 18 October 2019, the 1st defendant appointed the 2nd and 3rd defendants as joint receivers (the “Receivers”). On or about 23 October 2019, the 2nd and 3rd defendants wrote to each of the plaintiffs informing that they have been appointed Receivers over the plaintiffs’ charged assets. 20 The plaintiffs raise three main issues in their action against the 1st defendant: (a) whether the 1st defendant was put on notice that Mr Meegan had neither actual nor apparent authority to negotiate and conclude the Loan Agreement, in particular the clauses in relation to the payment of the Additional Interest (the “Notice Issue”); (b) whether HL China is an “Appraiser” as defined in the Loan Agreement (the “HL China Issue”); and (c) further and/or alternatively, whether there are manifest errors in HL China Valuation Report that justify the valuation being set aside (the “Valuation Issue”). 21 The plaintiffs submit that if it is found that there is no Additional Interest Amount owed to the 1st defendant, then it follows that the 2nd and 3rd defendants’ appointment as Receivers is invalid and void.",
        "The Notice Issue": "",
        "Plaintiffs’ case": "51 In particular, the plaintiffs submit that the appointment of HL China failed to comply with the conditions in para 3(a) of Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement for the appointment of an Appraiser, which provides that the valuation of the Exit Proceeds had to be determined by an “Appraiser”, which is defined as “a reputable appraisal firm with operations in Japan appointed by [the 1st defendant] in consultation with the Borrower Agent”. Clause 20 of the Loan Agreement defines “Borrower Agent” as NRE. The plaintiffs make three submissions on this issue. 52 First, HL China lacks “operations in Japan”. At most, HL China has an affiliate company with operations in Japan, which is presumably Houlihan Lokey K K (“HL Japan”). This appears to be a distinct corporate entity with a different Managing Director and different employees. Hence, it is HL Japan that has “operations in Japan”, not HL China. If the 1st defendant’s interpretation of “Appraiser” is correct, it would mean that the valuation could have been carried out by any entity within the Houlihan Lokey group (since they would all be “affiliated” to HL Japan). But it would be baffling if the parties had intended for the valuation of the properties in Osaka to have been carried out by for examplethe Houlihan Lokey entity in Dubai. 53 Second, a reasonable reading of the definition of “Appraiser” indicates that not only was the Appraiser to have “operations in Japan”, but that the valuation was to be carried out by those “operations in Japan”. This is sensible, since the reference to “operations in Japan” necessarily indicates the parties’ objective intention for the valuation to be carried out by the Japanese operations of that “reputable appraisal firm”. The parties could not have intended HL Japan to be appointed as the Appraiser, but for the actual valuation to be subcontracted to a valuation firm in Egypt. Hence even if HL China is treated as having “operations in Japan”, the valuation process was still notcarried out by HL China’s “operations in Japan” (ie, HL Japan). Instead, the valuation was carried out by Enrix. 54 Third, HL China was not appointed “in consultation with NRE”. Only Mr Kataoka was consulted, but he is not a staff of NRE. The relevant timeline shows the following. Mr Meegan was dismissed as sole director of the plaintiffs on 23 October 2018. On or about 23 October 2018, Mr Horikawa and Ms Zhang were appointed as directors of the plaintiffs and the ACRA records were accordingly updated. Ms Lee from the 1st defendant knew by 4 December 2018 that Mr Meegan had “retired”,ie,that he was no longer the sole director of the plaintiffs. On 5 December 2018, Ms Lee sent to Mr Kataoka a list of potential valuation firms, including a “Houlihan Lokey”. On the same day, Mr Kataoka replied that he had “[n]o objection, assuming they do fair valuation”. 55 The plaintiffs submit that it is undisputed that Mr Kataoka held no position in and was not employed by the plaintiffs. The documentary evidence indicates that Mr Kataoka acted as part of Mr Meegan’steam. Hence, even if Mr Kataoka had any authority (actual or implied) to speak on behalf of the plaintiffs, such authority would necessarily have been derived from Mr Meegan, and not the plaintiffs. Therefore, upon the removal of Mr Meegan as sole director, any actualauthority that Mr Kataoka had to represent the plaintiffs disappeared with Mr Meegan. The 1st defendant found out on 4 December 2018 from Mr Kataoka that Mr Meegan was no longer the sole director of the plaintiffs. The 1st defendant would at that point, have been put on notice of the termination of Mr Kataoka’s actual authority. From 4 December 2018 onwards, Mr Kataoka lacked actual and apparent authority to represent the plaintiffs. So, the appointment of HL China and any participation by Mr Kataoka in the valuation process could not have been on the account of the plaintiffs.",
        "1st defendant’s case": "56 The 1st defendant’s response is that HL China is an appraiser with operations in Japan. HL China confirmed in its letter of engagement dated 6 February 2019 that it had a Japanese affiliate with offices in Roppongi, Tokyo. 57 In addition, nothing in Schedule 1 precluded HL China from subcontracting the real estate appraisal to a valuer based in Japan. The plaintiffs knew that HL China would subcontract such work to a local Japanese real estate appraiser,ie, Enrix and did not raise any objections. Mr Kataoka had dealt with Enrix and even facilitated their real estate appraisal during the valuation process, without objection. In an email from Ms Lee to Mr Kataoka dated 5 December 2018, she explained that the 1st defendant “need a third party independent valuation firm (rather than just purely a real estate valuer) as this exercise will include the value of all of TMK’s assets”. This was why HL China was appointed even though Enrix conducted the valuation of the properties in Osaka. 58 The plaintiffs’ expectation that the Japan operation of the appraisal firm has to perform the valuation, is not expressed in Schedule 1, para 3(a) of the Loan Agreement. If this was the parties’ intention, para 3(a) could have simply stated: “Appraiser” means “a reputable Japanese appraisal firm appointed by the Lender in consultation with the Borrower Agent”. However, it does not. 59  The 1st defendant submits that the plaintiffs had by their conduct, represented that Mr Kataoka was authorised to deal on their behalf. Mr Kataoka engaged the 1st defendant and DB Tokyo in relation to Financing for the Sale Leaseback Transaction with the knowledge of Mr Meegan and Dr Yabumoto. Mr Kataoka continued to be involved in and acted as the plaintiffs’ representative post-investment (ie, after the closing of the Financing for the Sale Leaseback Transaction). Mr Kataoka was involved in the prepayment of the principal loan and fixed interest. Mr Kataoka was involved in the valuation process and was in direct communication with HL China and Enrix. Mr Kataoka had also arranged the 7 August 2019 meeting between the 1st defendant’s representatives, Dr Yabumoto, Nishiki Corporation representatives and senior lenders per the Mizuho refinancing that took place in June 2017. 60 The 1st defendant also relies on the terms of the Investment Management Deed17Foot Note 17×2AB at pp 942–973.dated 28 June 2016 (“IM Deed”) for Mr Kataoka’s actual authority. Per the IM Deed, Brocade Management Pte Ltd, as manager, had extensive powers in relation to the plaintiffs which included procuring their compliance with their obligations under the Loan Agreement. 61 The 1st defendant highlights that at no point prior to NRE’s letter dated 29 August 2019, was the 1st defendant informed that Mr Kataoka was not the plaintiffs’ authorised representative. There was an email from Ms Zhang to Dr Yabumoto dated 19 August 2016 conveying a message from Mr Meegan that with the first financing arrangement over, there should be separation of NH employees (Mr Meegan) from third party consultants (Mr Kataoka).18Foot Note 18×4AB at p 2214.But this was internal to the Nishiki group and never conveyed to the 1st defendant.",
        "My decision": "The Receivers did not fail to take basic steps for due diligence/independent assessment 162 I find that the plaintiffs have not established that the Receivers failed to take basic steps for due diligence or independent assessment. 163 The plaintiffs’ case is not that there is no evidence that the Receivers reviewed the Security Documents before accepting appointment, but that there is nodocumentaryevidence of such. However, this was never part of their pleaded case. Neither the 1st defendant nor the Receivers had the opportunity to produce the necessary documents to respond to this allegation. The first time the plaintiffs raised it was during the cross-examination of Mr Akhtar, who testified that he did receive the Security Documents from the 1st defendant before being appointed as receiver.97Foot Note 97×NE 20 August 2021 at p 46; NE 24 August 21 at p 107.I find Mr Akhtar to be a credible witness and accept his evidence on this. 164 Similarly, the plaintiffs’ case that there were issues with the formalities of the Notices of Appointment was never pleaded. Neither the 1st defendant nor the Receivers had the opportunity to produce the necessary documents to respond to this allegation. Moreover, it was the evidence of the 1st defendant’s Mr Garfield that the Receivers were properly appointed. This was in his AEIC at paras 21–22. It was also his testimony on the stand that all the formalities for appointment of the Receivers were complied with.98Foot Note 98×NE 19 August 2021 at p 79.If the plaintiffs had issues with the specific authority of the persons who signed the Notices of Appointment, they could have asked Mr Garfield when he was on the stand, but they chose not to do so. 165 The plaintiffs’ allegation that the Receivers failed to make sufficient inquiries as to the underlying debt is again, not part of their pleaded case. It is also contrary to a position that they took at trial through their counsel, who stated that the plaintiffs “are not saying that there was a duty on the part of the receivers to go and investigate more”.99Foot Note 99×NE 2 September 2021 at p 6.The plaintiffs also accepted that the dispute over the Additional Interest and whether the Loan Agreement should be set aside, were issues between the plaintiffs and the 1st defendant, and the subject matter of the trial. 166 That the Additional Interest was calculated by the 1st defendant on the basis of a draft valuation report does not change this for the Receivers. This is unlikeBatrouney, which the plaintiffs cited. There, the court held that it was inappropriate for the receivers of a law firm to bring proceedings against Mr Forster, the law firm’s former principal, without ascertaining to whom the moneys were due and despite being advised by Deloitte that nothing was owing by Mr Forster to the clients. In this case, the 1st defendant’s position as lender, was that the debt was due and quantified on the basis of the draft valuation report, which was done in accordance with the Loan Agreement. The Loan Agreement only requires the Appraiser to make a determination. It does not require a written report or a final report. The 1st defendant had also informed the Receivers that the numbers in the final valuation report would not change,100Foot Note 100×NE 20 August 2021 pp 52 and 61.and they did not change. The Receivers were entitled to rely on the instructions by the lender, the 1st defendant. I note that it was open to the plaintiffs to take out any interim relief or injunction to restrain the receivership, but they did not do so for close to two years since the receivership commenced on 18 October 2019. 167 Neither do the correspondence relied on by the plaintiffs show recklessness or collusion on the part of the Receivers. The 4 November 2019 Letter101Foot Note 101×6AB at p 3330.simply states thatbased on the Notices of Appointment,102Foot Note 102×6AB at pp 3068–3070.the Receivers were duly appointed. The Notices of Appointment from the 1st defendant to the Receivers stated,inter alia, that the plaintiffs’ failure to make payment of the Additional Interest constitutes a breach of obligations entitling the 1st defendant to appoint a Receiver pursuant to Section 5 of the Security. Thus, the 4 November 2019 Letter does not indicate that the Receivers took a position on the Additional Interest or took sides. 168The 31 October 2019 duplicate of theReceivers’ 4 November 2019 Letter also does not demonstrate collusion between them and the 1st defendant. HEP are the solicitors for the 1st defendant. The Receivers were entitled to see HEP’s reply to the plaintiffs, which sets out the 1st defendant’s position, before issuing their letter to the plaintiffs. 169Moreover, as set out in Gabriel Moss and Gavin Lightman,Lightman & Moss on the Law of Administrators and Receivers of Companies(Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Ed, 2017) (“Lightman & Moss”)atpara 13-008, “provided [the receiver] acts in good faith, when deciding whether and, if so, how to exercise powers vested in him, a receiver is likewise entitled and indeed obliged to give priority to the interests of the mortgagee in securing repayment.” The touchstone is thus whether the Receivers acted in good faith.Lightman & Mossatpara 13-009 to 13-010 also sets out that: Breach of the duty of good faith involves something more than negligence or even gross negligence: it requires some dishonesty, or improper motive, some element of bad faith, to be established. … Reckless indifference to the rights or interests of others or shutting one’s eyes deliberately to the consequences of one’s actions may suffice to establish dishonesty or bad faith. … [I]f the decision lay outside the range which the court thought might be arrived at by a reasonable commercial man, this might provide some evidence that the decision was not taken in good faith. 170After assessing the plaintiffs’ submissions and the evidence, I find that the plaintiffs have not shown that the Receivers did not act in good faith. The Receivers did not create misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations, to advance the 1st defendant’s interests 171 I find that the plaintiffs have not established that the Receivers created misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations to advance the 1st defendant’s interests. 172 The plaintiffs’ case is that the 23 October 2019 Letter wrongly stated that the 14-day period under s 223 of the Companies Act runs from the date of the letter, when the statutory period actually runs 14 days after the company receives the notice of appointment. The 23 October 2019 Letter was only received by Ms Zhang on 24 October 2019. However, it is undisputed that: (a) The only two directors of the plaintiffs received the notices and one of them, Mr Horikawa, received it by email on the same day of the 23 October 2019 Letter. (b) The Receivers’ staff visited the plaintiffs’ premises on the day the notices were issued. No one was in the office. They visited again the next day on 24 October 2019 and Ms Zhang acknowledged receipt. (c)Neither Ms Zhang nor Mr Horikawa said that they were at all misled as to the statutory period of filing. Their evidence was that they were instructed by Mr Matsuda not to comply with the requirements to submit the Statement of Affairs. They therefore did not. The Statement of Affairs was only submitted on 29 September 2021 after orders were made in HC/OS 611/2021. 173 I accept Mr Akhtar’s evidence that the intent was for delivery of the letter on 23 October 2019 and hence the letter was worded as it was.103Foot Note 103×NE 20 August 2021 at p 85.Taking into consideration all the circumstances, I find no intent on the part of the Receivers to wrongly gain a marginal advantage of an earlier filing by one day, nor was there misimpression created on the part of the plaintiffs. 174 Neither do I find the plaintiffs’ emphasis on the Receivers’ use of “confirmed” when communicating with Nishiki TMK and the Japanese Lenders, to be persuasive. I do not find that by stating that ACRA had “confirmed” the Receivers’ appointment as receivers and that the “record of ACRA makes clear that [the Receivers] have been validly appointed”, the Receivers were intending to give the misimpression that ACRA had accepted that a debt was owed by the plaintiffs to the 1st defendant. In any event, the plaintiffs had discussed with Nishiki TMK and the Japanese Lenders after the Receivers sent their letter.The plaintiffs have not pleaded any risk of prejudiceto their credit lines, nor have they surfaced evidence of any loss arising from the Receivers’ letters to the Japanese Lenders. 175 The plaintiffs also submitted that there was misrepresentation by the Receivers in their letters to UOB and the Japanese Lenders by stating that all the directors’ powers over the charged assets now vested in the Receivers rather than in the directors. However, beyond a suggestion that this may have been to prevent the banks from withholding information from the Receivers,104Foot Note 104×PCS2D3D at para 60.the plaintiffs were unable to show how the banks were in any way misinformed arising from this, or what they did as a result of such alleged misrepresentation. The Receivers did not make demands and threats that had no basis in law 176 I find that the plaintiffs have not established that the Receivers made demands and threats that had no basis in law. 177 The plaintiffs claim that the Receivers should have sought Japanese law advice prior to making requests from Nishiki TMK and KMC. However, they have not pleaded any matters of Japanese lawnor adduced any evidence of such. 178 The plaintiffs also claim that there was no evidence that the requirements for liability had been met as the requisite notice had not been served on the plaintiffs.105Foot Note 105×PCS2D3D at paras 64 and 43.However, as set out above, both directors of the plaintiffs acknowledged receipt of the notice – Mr Horikawa, on the day the letter was dated and Ms Zhang, on the next day (see [172] above). Mr Akhtar’s evidence was that the letter was drafted as such because the intent was to serve it on the same day. I do not find this to be a threat to gain a marginal advantage of one day in the filing of the Statement of Affairs. 179 Neither do I find the Receivers’ demand for NH’s share certificates and share transfer forms to be a threat. I accept the Receivers’ explanation that they demanded for the share certificates because they only had sight of the share certificates for the one Singapore dollar share held by NH in each of NRE and NII, but not the shares in Japanese yen. No basis for Adverse Inference 180 I find no basis to draw an adverse inference against the Receivers. The plaintiffs’ requests for the SUM 3278 Communications were considered by the AR in SUM 3278.The AR held that the correspondence between the Receivers andthe 1st defendant were covered by litigation privilege, while the internal documents sought against the Receivers were covered by litigation privilege and, where applicable, legal advice privilege. I also note that the AR found the plaintiffs’ request tobe a “fishing expedition”.The plaintiffs’ appeal was heard by Justice Chua Lee Ming on 4 November 2020 and dismissed. In other words, the documents were not disclosed because the plaintiffs failed in their application for disclosure, including their appeal. Cross-examination on what the court had already found to be privileged in SUM 3278, would not be appropriate. 181I find that the plaintiffs are in any event, estopped from challenging the disclosure of such documents. I agree with the authorities cited by the Receivers: seeGoh NellieandTMT Asia Ltd. 182The plaintiffs rely onSingapore Civil Procedureat para 24/5/5, which citesBanqueCantonale Vaudoise v Fujitrans (Singapore) Pte Ltd [2007] 1 SLR(R) 570 for the proposition that “[t]here is no question of issue estoppel even where the categories of documents sought in a discovery application mirror or are wider than those unsuccessfully sought in a prior discovery application. An applicant is entitled to a second application for discovery as long as he can show the courtchanged circumstanceswhich warrant the discovery of documents previously denied to him” [emphasis added]. However, the plaintiffs have not shown any changed circumstances to warrant a second application. InTranspacCapital Pte Ltd v Lam Soon (Thailand) Co Ltd[1999] 3 SLR (R) 454 (“TranspacCapital”), the court noted at [26] that while aninterlocutory judgment can contain a determination which is final for estoppel purposes, the ultimate question is not so much whether the earlier decision was final or interlocutory, but whether in the circumstances it is reasonable to regard the earlier decision as a final determination of the issue which one of the parties now wishes to raise. The plaintiffs here have not shown that in the circumstances, it is reasonable to regard the earlier decision (including the dismissal of the plaintiffs’ appeal by the High Court) as anything other than a final determination. 183The plaintiffs refer to Mr Tchen’s testimony as an example of changed circumstances and how the plaintiffs may have been prejudiced. ButMr Tchen himself confirmed during cross-examination that he has never met or communicated with the Receivers, and that he did not know as a matter of fact whether or not the Access Letter was provided to the Receivers. There is hence no evidence that Mr Akhtar did receive the Access Letter. The plaintiffs did not apply to re-examine any of the 1st defendant’s witnesses or Mr Akhtar on this point but chose to leave it as that. In any event, the draft HL China Valuation Report in March 2019 had already contained a disclaimer that it “may not be relied upon by any other person or entity”, while the disclaimer against use of the valuation report by the “receivers” is found in the final HL China Valuation Report dated 13 November 2019. These reports were available to the plaintiffs before the trial. If the plaintiffs regarded such a disclaimer as a basis to attack the Receivers’ appointment or exercise of their duty, they could have done so on that basis, even without the Access Letter, but they did not. Conclusion on alternative claim against Receivers 184 In conclusion, I find no basis to the plaintiffs’ alternative claim against the Receivers for failure to discharge their duties in good faith and/or being biased, and hence dismiss their alternative claim against the Receivers. 185The plaintiffs claim that if the receivership is invalid, the Receivers are liable for trespass and/or wrongful interference.In this case, as found above, the Receivers were entitled to regard the receivership as valid at the point of appointment, and the plaintiffs have not shown that the Receivers failed to discharge their duties in good faith or were biased. Consequently, the plaintiffs have not established that the Receivers did trespass or engaged in wrongful interference.The Receiversalso submit that the plaintiffs have not pleaded any alleged loss. Owing to the plaintiffs’ obstructive behaviour, the Receivers have not even been able to take any meaningful possession over the charged assets and could not have caused loss. To the extent that the Receivers exercised any powers pursuant to the directions granted in HC/OS 611/2021, such powers would be exercised to preserve the charged assets and would not cause any loss to the Plaintiffs. I agree with the Receivers that the plaintiffs have not pleaded what loss they would suffer arising from the Receivership nor shown evidence of any such loss. I dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim for damages against the Receivers. 186The plaintiffs also sought an order for the Receivers to provide an account of all transactions conducted bythe Receivers in relation to the plaintiffs’ assets and/or interests, as well as an Order that the Receivers jointly and severally forthwith deliver up and/or transfer possession and/or title and/or ownership of the plaintiffs’ assets and/or interests and/or the traceable proceeds of the same. As neither party has submitted on this, I will hear further submissions on the consequential orders sought.",
        "The HL China issue": "50 In the event the Loan Agreement is found valid and enforceable against the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs submit that the HL China Issue arises.",
        "The Valuation Issue": "98 The third issue is the “Valuation Issue”. As I have determined the HL China Issue in favour of the plaintiffs and set aside the appointment of HL China and the HL China Valuation Report, the Valuation Issue does not arise. Nevertheless, for completeness, I will deal briefly with the Valuation Issue here. 99 The plaintiffs’ preliminary submission is that HL China could not have determined the Additional Interest amount because Enrix’s reports were at all material times a draft. However, the Loan Agreement does not impose a requirement for a final report from the Appraiser nor a requirement that the demand for Additional Interest be based on a final report from the Appraiser. Mr Matsuda acknowledged on the stand that Schedule 1 of the Loan Agreement did not require a report from HL China for the computation of the Additional Interest.34Foot Note 34×NE 13 August 2021 at p 5.What the Loan Agreement requires, is that the Appraiser makes a determination of the fair market value of the assets of Nishiki TMK. In addition, HL China’s valuation did not change between the draft HL Report (25 March 2019) and the final HL Report (13 November 2019). 100 The parties agree that the key question in the Valuation Issue is whether there are manifest errors in the HL China Valuation Report. InViking Engineering Pte Ltd v Feen,Bjornar and others and another matter[2020] SGHC 78 (“Viking Engineering”), the court summarised at [69]–[70] that a “manifest error” is one that: (a) is obvious or patent; (b) obviously capable of affecting the determination; and (c) admits of no difference of opinion. Arithmetic miscalculations, mistakes as to the identity of parties, or reference to a building that does not exist are examples of manifest errors. In contrast, the following arenotmanifest errors: (a) a failure to take into account relevant considerations or taking into account irrelevant considerations; (b) errors in judgment,eg, treating as good debts that turn out to be bad, or omitting losses that were not known at the time; and (c) mistakes in the reasoning process; and (d) negligent valuations. 101 The plaintiffs’ expert, Mr Takashi Nakazawa (“Mr Nakazawa”), and the 1st defendant’s expert, Mr Junya Igarashi (“Mr Igarashi”), both produced written reports. They also provided their views on the nine issues raised by Mr Nakazawa in a Scott Schedule. Both experts gave testimony and answered questions jointly in court.",
        "The parties’ case": "102 The plaintiffs submit that the nine issues raised by Mr Nakazawa in his report constitute four manifest errors by Enrix: (a) Wrongly allocating rent for each property (Issues 1 to 3). (b) Wrongly assessing rental affordability (rent burdened ratio) for each property (Issues 4 to 7). (c) Inconsistent application of capitalisation rates (Issue 8). (d) Error in including the rental renewal fee and failure to deduct Nishiki TMK’s property management fee as an expense item (part of Issue 9). 103 The 1st defendant relies on the report and testimony of Mr Igarashi to show that there is no manifest error.",
        "Oral Agreement between Mr Matsuda and Mr Okamoto": "136 For completeness, I will also deal with the plaintiffs’ submission that there was an oral agreement between Mr Matsuda and Mr Okamoto on or about 27 September 2019, whereby the 1st defendant agreed that the plaintiffs could appoint a third-party appraisal firm to review the draft HL China Valuation Report and that all parties refrain from taking any legal or enforcement action pending the plaintiffs’ appointment of a third-party appraisal firm for the review. 137 Both Mr Matsuda and Mr Okamoto differed in their oral testimony on whether there was such an oral agreement at their meeting on 27 September 2019. The main document the plaintiffs rely on is the email sent by Mr Okamoto to Mr Matsuda on 1 October 2019 where Mr Okamoto said: “Regarding the valuation process, I hope that it will be completed in two weeks so that we can reach the final agreement.” This in itself does not support the plaintiffs’ position.Mr Okamoto’s explanation of this email is that the 1st defendant was prepared to give the plaintiffs two weeks as courtesy, but not more. This explanation is supported by the internal correspondence of the 1st defendant. Mr Okamoto’s email to his colleagues on 29 September 2019 shows that he had not made any commitment at the 27 September 2019 meeting and that he was seeking in the email, his colleagues’ views of the next steps. In his email reply to Mr Okamoto on 29 September 2019, the 1st defendant’s Mr Scott Garfield (“Mr Garfield”) says he would tell the plaintiffs “two weeks” as courtesy. On 30 September 2019, Mr Okamoto informed his colleagues that he had told Mr Matsuda that they would “not have any valuation discussions going forward and that the appraisal process on their end will just be for them to confirm the calculations” and proposed that the 1st defendant give a two-week timeframe for the plaintiffs to confirm. This was followed by the 1 October 2019 email sent out by Mr Okamoto to Mr Matsuda. 138 I therefore find that the evidence supports the 1st defendant’s position that there was no oral agreement between Mr Matsuda and Mr Okamoto. The 1st defendant has also submitted that the plaintiffs have failed to plead or show what consideration there was for the alleged oral agreement.62Foot Note 62×1st Defendant’s Reply Submissions at para 304.The plaintiffs indeed did not plead or show consideration. PerSingapore Civil Procedure 2021vol 1 (Cavinder Bull gen ed)(Sweet & Maxwell, 2021) (“Singapore CivilProcedure”) at para 18/2/5 and 18/12/10, consideration must be stated in the pleadings if an agreement is alleged. In the absence of consideration, even if there was an oral agreement, it would have been unenforceable.",
        "Plaintiffs’ claims against the Receivers": "",
        "Plaintiffs’ pleaded case": "139 In addition to its claims against the 1st defendant, the plaintiffs claim against the 2nd and 3rd defendants (the “Receivers”) the following: (a) a declaration that Sankaty’s appointment of the 2nd and 3rd defendants as receivers was invalid and void (“Prayer 1”); (b) in the alternative to Prayer 1, a declaration that the 2nd and 3rd defendants have failed to discharge their duties in good faith and/or are biased, and are to be removed as receivers (“Alternative Prayer”); (c) an order that the 2nd and 3rd defendants provide an account of all transactions conducted by the 2nd and 3rd defendants in relation to the plaintiffs’ assets and/or interests; (d) an order that the 2nd and 3rd defendants jointly and severally forthwith deliver up and/or transfer possession and/or title and/or ownership of the plaintiffs’ assets and/or interests and/or the traceable proceeds of the same; (e) damages and/or equitable compensation to be jointly and severally paid by the 2nd and 3rd defendants for injury, loss and/or damage sustained by the plaintiffs by reason of the 2nd and 3rd defendants’ trespass and/or wrongful interference. 140 The plaintiffs acknowledge that their prayer for a declaration that the Receivers’ appointment is invalid and void (ie, Prayer 1) has to proceed against the 1st defendant rather than the Receivers. Following from my ruling above on the HL China Issue that the appointment of HL China and the HL China Valuation Report is to be set aside, the Receivers’ appointment would consequently be invalid and void. 141 Nevertheless, as the plaintiffs also strenuously maintained their claim for the Alternative Prayer, I will deal with it here for completeness. 142 The plaintiffs maintained their claim for the Alternative Prayer, despite their acknowledgement of the weakness of their claim for it. The plaintiffs’ main witness for their claims, Mr Matsuda, stated in his AEIC at para 125 that: (a) the Plaintiffs will accordingly on the present state of the evidencenotbe pressing the Plaintiffs’ allegations in paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Statement of Claim (Amendment No. 1) filed on 9 June 2021 against the Receivers at the trial, pending of course any new evidence that may arise through cross-examination or otherwise; and (b) but the Plaintiffs maintain that on the state of evidence available to the Plaintiffsat the time the present claim was filedthe Plaintiffs were entitled to take the position that the Receivers were acting in bad faith, etc, and that in fact the Plaintiffs still believe that to be so. [emphasis in original] 143 In the Plaintiffs’ Opening Statement at para 65, the plaintiffs state: … on the state of the current evidence, the Plaintiffs forthrightly accept that they would find it hard to meet the required standard of proof. However, if new evidence should surface to support the contentions set out in [48] and [49] of the Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs will pursue these contentions and reserve the right to cross-examine the Receivers on the same. 144 Paragraphs 48 and 49 of the Statement of Claim (“SOC”) states: 48. Further or alternatively, if the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were validly appointed as receivers, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants would owe the Plaintiffs the duty to exercise due care and diligence. This duty would include a duty to act in good faith and to act impartially.  49. In this regard, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants are biased and / or have failed to act in good faith and / or are wrongfully colluding with Sankaty. These are the best particulars that the Plaintiffs can provide pending discovery. Particulars (a) By way of letter dated 24 October 2019, the Plaintiffs informed the 2nd and 3rd Defendants that the Plaintiffs denied Sankaty’s demand for Additional Interest, and that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ purported appointment as receivers was accordingly invalid. (b) On 4 November 2019, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants replied to sayinter aliathat they took the position that the Additional Interest as quantified by Sankaty was due and owing. The 2nd and 3rd Defendants had therefore taken a positive position on the substantive merits in favour of Sankaty. (c) It is highly unlikely that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants had, in 11 days, managed to start and complete their investigations into the disputed issues and take independent legal advice on the same. (d) The obvious inference is that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants were colluding with Sankaty. (e) Hence, on 5 November 2019, the Plaintiffs wrote to ask that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants disclose all correspondence the 2nd and 3rd Defendants had exchanged with Sankaty on the substantive merits. (f) The 2nd and 3rd Defendants have to date refused to provide any disclosure whatsoever. (g) Despite being put on notice by 24 October 2019 of the disputed debt, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants consented to their registration by Sankaty as receivers of the Plaintiffs. … (h) On 23 December 2019, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants wrote to the Plaintiffs’directorsthreatening legal action. In particular, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants threatened that they would not hesitate to hold the directors liable for any losses caused toSankaty. (i) Yet the 2nd and 3rd Defendants’ have no standing in law to hold the Plaintiffs’ directors liable for losses caused toSankaty. (j) On 2 January 2020, the Plaintiffs’ directors wrote to the 2nd and 3rd Defendants and alleged that they were Sankaty’s “cat’s paw”. The letter also stated that the 2nd and 3rd Defendants, even if validly appointed, would be unable to discharge their duty to act in good faith. The basis of the allegations were the particulars set out at (a) to (i) above. (k) To date, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants have not denied the charges nor provided any explanation. (l) Further, on 14 January 2020, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants sent a letter to Nishiki TMK (a Japan company) notifying Nishiki TMK of their purported appointment as joint receivers of NRE and NII. In their letter, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants gave the false and misleading impression that: (i) the ACRA records presently listed NII as being under receivership. This was patently false; and (ii) because ACRA had accepted the registration of their appointment as receivers, ACRA had accepted that a debt was owed by the Plaintiffs to Sankaty, and that ACRA had accepted the validity of their appointment as receivers. This was patently misleading, and omitted the obvious fact, which might not be readily apparent to a foreign entity, that ACRA is a filing registry that cannot and does not assess or rule on the validity of a receiver’s appointment, much less on whether a disputed debt is owed. (m) On 14 January 2020, the 2nd and 3rd Defendants also sent letters to Nishiki TMK’s bankers in Japan, namely, Mizuho Bank Ltd, Orix Corporation, United Overseas Bank Limited, Fuyo General Lease Co Ltd, The Kagoshima Bank Ltd, and The Hyakugo Bank Ltd. These letters contained the same false and misleading statements. … 145 During the trial, after Mr Matsuda’s affirmation of para 125 of his AEIC on the stand, counsel for the Receivers invited him to formally withdraw the plaintiffs’ claim for the Alternative Prayer. He declined. When asked why, his reply was that “because our position is that we don’t accept the receivership”.63Foot Note 63×NE 13 August 2021 at p 39.The trial was stood down for plaintiffs’ counsel to speak with Mr Matsuda and explain that the plaintiffs’ claim for the invalidity of the receivership would have to proceed against the 1st defendant and was distinct from their alternative claim against the Receivers. When trial resumed, counsel for the plaintiffs reiterated that the plaintiffs would maintain their alternative claim against the Receivers. 146 The plaintiffs then submitted that the plaintiffs’ case for the Alternative Prayer stood on four pillars.64Foot Note 64×NE 13 August 2021 at pp 44–46.First, for the Receivers to take a position by their reply of 4 November 2019, that the Additional Interest as quantified by the 1st defendant was due and owing within 11 days, showed evidence of collusion: SOC at paras 49(a)–(c). Second, when the plaintiffs asked the Receivers for correspondence that they had with the 1st defendant, they refused: SOC at paras 49(e)–(f). Third, the Receivers threatened legal action against the plaintiffs’ directors for losses caused to the 1st defendant: SOC at paras 49(h)–(i). Fourth, the Receivers sent letters on 14 January 2020 to Nishiki TMK’s four foreign banks stating that the Receivers were validly appointed when they were not: SOC at paras 49(l)–(m).",
        "Plaintiffs’ case in the closing submissions": "147 At the conclusion of trial, as it was still unclear what the plaintiffs’ position was in relation to their Alternative Prayer against the Receivers, they were directed to provide an outline of their case, which would provide the issues for the parties’ respective closing submissions. 148 In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs pivoted from their pleaded case and what their counsel had stated in the middle of trial as the four pillars of their pleaded case. They now submit that the Receivers owed the plaintiffs the duty to exercise due care and diligence and breached their duties in three ways. The Receivers failed to take basic steps for due diligence/independent assessment 149 The plaintiffs’ first submission is that the Receivers failed to take the most basic steps for due diligence/independent assessment. They point to the following: (a) there is no documentary evidence that the Receivers had received the Security Documents before accepting their appointment on 18 October 2019;65Foot Note 65×Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (“PCS2D3D”) at para 27. (b) the Receivers had no basisto believe that the persons who signed the Notices of Appointment did in fact have the requisite authority;66Foot Note 66×PCS2D3D at paras 32–33. (c) the Receivers knew that they were unjustifiably appointed on the basis of a draft valuation report.67Foot Note 67×PCS2D3D at para 35.The Receivers could only speculate (as was the case inBatrouneyv Forster(No 2)[2015] VSC 541 (“Batrouney”)) that the final valuation report would be identical to the draft;68Foot Note 68×Plaintiffs’ Reply Submissions against the 2nd and 3rd Defendants (“PRS2D3D”) at paras 17 and 23. (d) the Receivers wanted to conceal that they had a letter as of 31 October 2019 (“31 October 2019 Letter”), which was a duplicate of what they sent out on 4 November 2019 (“4 November 2019 Letter”), which means that as of 31 October 2019, the Receivers already knew what the 1st defendant’s solicitor’s (Harry Elias Partnership LLP (“HEP”)) letter of 31 October 2019 (“HEP 31 October 2019 Letter”) would state;69Foot Note 69×PCS2D3D at para 40.and (e) Mr Akhtar accepted that certain paragraphs in the 4 November 2019 Letter amounted to the Receivers taking a positive position on the merits of the HEP 31 October 2019 Letter.70Foot Note 70×PCS2D3D at para 42. The Receivers created misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations to advance the 1st defendant’s interests  150 The plaintiffs’ second submission is that the Receivers created misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations to advance the 1st defendant’s interests: (a) the Receivers misrepresented to the plaintiffs’ directors in their letter dated 23 October 2019 (“23 October 2019 Letter”) that the 14-day period for submission under s 223 of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) (“Companies Act”) runs from the date of the letter, which was wrong because the notices were only served on the company a day after the date of the letter;71Foot Note 71×PCS2D3D at para 43. (b) the Receivers misrepresented to Nishiki TMK and six Japanese banks (who were lenders with first priority over the charged assets (“Japanese Lenders”)), when they informed them that records under the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (“ACRA”) “confirmed” their appointment as receivers and that the “record of ACRA makes clear that [the Receivers] have been validly appointed”. The Receivers gave the impression that ACRA had accepted that the plaintiffs owed a debt to the 1st defendant and ACRA accepted the validity of the Receivers’ appointment. This was done to impact the credit lines of the plaintiffs’ related companies in Japan;72Foot Note 72×PCS2D3D at paras 45–53.and (c) the Receivers misrepresented in their letter to UOB dated 3 January 2020,73Foot Note 73×6AB at p 3472.that the plaintiffs’ directors had no more powers upon the Receivers’ appointment. The letter stated: “Accordingly, all the powers vested with the Directors of NII including in respect of the management of the Company’s business are suspended and transferred to the Receivers, since the date of our appointment.” This was repeated in the letter to Japanese Lenders.74Foot Note 74×6AB at p 3492. The Receivers made demands and threats that had no basis in law  151 The plaintiffs’ third submission is that the Receivers made demands and threats that had no basis in law: (a) the Receivers requested for information and full access to inspect documents against Nishiki TMK and KMC that had no basis under Japanese law;75Foot Note 75×PCS2D3D at para 61. (b) the Receivers communicated threats of regulatory and criminal liability to compel the directors to comply with the Receivers’ demands, without evidence that the requirements for liability had been met;76Foot Note 76×PCS2D3D at para 64.and (c) the Receivers made indiscriminate requests for NH’s share certificates and share transfer forms when they had most of the documents.77Foot Note 77×PCS2D3D at para 67. Adverse Inference 152 Finally, the plaintiffs submit that adverse inferences should be drawn against the Receivers pursuant to s 116 of the Evidence Act (Cap 97, 1997 Rev Ed),78Foot Note 78×PCS2D3D at para 84.as there was incomplete disclosure of documents. This was due to the defendants’ insistence of issue estoppel arising from the decision in HC/ORC 6221/2020, their assertion of litigation privilege on communications between the 1st defendant and the Receivers, and Mr Akhtar’s failure to inform the Court that he refused to sign an access letter sent by HL China to the 1st defendant (“Access Letter”).79Foot Note 79×PCS2D3D at paras 72–85.Mr Tchen testified that prior to HL China inserting into their 13 November 2019 Report that the Receivers may not rely on the report “without our prior written consent”,80Foot Note 80×NE 1 September 2021 at p 129.HL China had sent the Access Letter to the 1st defendant, which stated that the Receivers could not place reliance on the HL China Valuation Report. The 1st defendant replied to the valuers, saying that the Receivers were not going to sign it.81Foot Note 81×PRS2D3D at para 24. 153 The plaintiffs submit that adverse inferences should be drawn against the Receivers that the Receivers knew that nothing in the debentures allowed them to be appointed as receivers on the basis of draft valuation reports, but agreed to be appointed anyway, thatthe Receivers andthe 1st defendant were coordinating the Receivers’ efforts to secure payment as soon as possible and that they took steps to conceal such coordination.82Foot Note 82×PRS2D3D at para 86.",
        "The Receivers’ case": "Adverse Inference  154 The Receivers note that in HC/SUM 3278/2020 for discovery (“SUM 3278”), the plaintiffs sought the following:83Foot Note 83×2nd and 3rd Defendant’s Closing Submissions (“2D3DCS”) at paras 26–27.(a) Amended Category 1: All documents and correspondence between the 1st defendant and the Receivers leading up to the appointment of the Receivers; and (b) Amended Category 2: All internal documents and correspondence between the Receivers and PKF-Cap Advisory Partners Pte Ltd in relation to their appointment and matters related to the suit (collectively, the “SUM 3278 Communications”).Theassistant registrar (“AR”) did not allow the discovery request and found therequest to be a fishing expedition.The AR held that the correspondence between the Receivers andthe 1st defendant were covered by litigation privilege, while the internal documents sought against the Receivers were covered by litigation privilege and, where applicable, legal advice privilege. The plaintiffs’ appeal against the AR’s decision was heard by Justice Chua Lee Ming on 4 November 2020 and was dismissed. 155 The Receivers submit that there is hence no basis to draw any adverse inference. The documents were not disclosed because of the plaintiffs’ (failed) discovery application. InSudhaNatrajan v The Bank of East Asia Ltd[2017] 1 SLR 141, the court held at [20]–[21] that an adverse inference should not be drawn where the failure to produce evidence is reasonably attributable to reasons other than the merits of the case or the issue in question.84Foot Note 84×2D3DCS at para 50. 156 In any event, the plaintiffs are estopped from challenging the disclosure of such documents. Parties cannot seek to re-litigate the same issues that were “fundamental and not merely collateral” to the earlier decision:Goh Nellie v Goh Lian Teckand others[2007] 1 SLR(R) 453 (“Goh Nellie”) at [34]–[35]. Decisions made in interlocutory applications are likewise regarded as final and conclusive judgments on the relevant issues:TMT Asia Ltd v BHP Billiton Marketing AG (Singapore Branch) and another[2019] 2 SLR 710 (“TMT Asia Ltd”)at [25]–[26].In accordance with the principle ofres judicata, the plaintiffs are bound by the court’s findings that the SUM 3278 Communications are privileged and notrelevant, and are not entitled to re-litigate the issue. A party has to show that the cross-examination relates to “relevant facts”. If such communications have already been found to be irrelevant or are privileged in the context of the specific discovery applications, such communications should not be issues for cross-examination. The plaintiffs have not pointed to any change of circumstances from the time of the specific discovery applications.85Foot Note 85×2D3DCS at paras 51–53. 157 The Receivers note that Mr Tchen confirmed on the stand that he has never met or communicated with the Receivers, and he did not know whether the Access Letter was provided by the 1st defendant to the Receivers.86Foot Note 86×2D3DCS at para 73. The Receivers failed to take basic steps for due diligence/independent assessment 158 In respect of the plaintiffs’ submission that the Receivers failed to take basic steps for due diligence, the Receivers contend that: (a) the plaintiffs’ suggestion that the Receivers did not review the Security Documents before accepting appointment, was only raised for the first time at trial. In any event, Mr Akhtar confirmed that he had received the Security Documents from the 1st defendant before he was appointed as a receiver;87Foot Note 87×2D3DCS at para 60. (b) the plaintiffs’ pleaded case never took issue with the formalities of the Notices of Appointment. This was only raised in the midst of trial. Had this been pleaded, the 1st defendant could have produced the relevant documents to respond to any such allegations.88Foot Note 88×2D3DCS at paras 63–64.In any event, Mr Akhtar confirmed that the Receivers were informed by the 1st defendant that the Notices of Appointment would be signed by authorised signatories. The 1st defendant also confirmed that the signatories on the Notices of Appointment were all authorised signatories. The plaintiffs had the chance to cross-examine Mr Garfield on the authority of the persons who signed the Notices of Appointment but chose not to do so;89Foot Note 89×2D3DCS at paras 65–66.and (c) the 4 November 2019 Letter does not make a judgment of the merits. It simply said that based on the Notices of Appointment, receivers are duly appointed, and they have to discharge their duties. Neither does the 31 October 2019 duplicate of the 4 November 2019 Letter demonstrate collusion. The Receivers’ response was prepared on 31 October 2019 but it was not sent out until Mr Akhtar signed and issued it on 4 November 2019.90Foot Note 90×2D3DCS at paras 134–139.  159The Receivers submit thatthe plaintiffs have not pleaded that the Receivers owe any specific duties to make any inquiries of the 1st defendant as regards the underlying debt. At trial, the plaintiffs confirmed that this is not their case.91Foot Note 91×2D3DCS at para 56.The Receivers were entitled to rely on the 1st defendant’s position that the debt fell due in accordance with the Loan Agreement.It was not for them to question the1st defendant on matters which fall outside the Receivers’ scope of duties. The Receivers submit that as long as a receiver is acting in good faith when exercising the powers vested in him, a receiver is “entitled and indeed obliged to give priority to the interests of the mortgagee” (ie, the debenture holder) in securing repayment. Further, the receiver (while acting in good faith) “must” in fact look to the interests of the mortgagee (ie, the 1st defendant), even if that causes damage to the mortgagor (ie, the plaintiffs).92Foot Note 92×2D3DCS at paras 101–102. The Receivers created misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations to advance the 1st defendant’s interests 160In respect of the plaintiffs’ submission that the Receivers created misimpressions, inaccuracies and false exaggerations to advance the 1st defendant’s interests, the Receivers submit the following: (a) the 23 October 2019 Letter was delivered to the two directors of the plaintiffs and both of them admitted receipt. The directors only submitted the Statement of Affairs after the court’s orders in HC/OS 611/2021 were made, and after the trial, on 29 September 2021. Whether the directors received the notices of appointment on 23 October 2019, or a few days later, is beside the point; (b) both directors did notsay that they were misinformed as to the statutory requirements. Their evidence is that they were instructed by Mr Matsuda not to submit the Statement of Affairs and they did not pursuant to those instructions;93Foot Note 93×2D3DCS at para 115. (c) there was no conscious intention or attempt to mislead through the Receivers’ letters to Nishiki TMK and the Japanese Lenders.MrAkhtar explained that it wasimportant for the Receivers to understand whether the Japanese banks had any concerns. In any event, Nishiki TMK and the Japanese Lenders were well apprised of the plaintiffs’ position.The plaintiffs have not pleaded any prejudice to their credit lines or loss arising from the Receivers’ letters to the Japanese Lenders; and (d)the Receivers did not misrepresent the extent of their powers. If a receiver is given powers to manage the company’s business, that “must be to the exclusion of the directors”.94Foot Note 94×2D3DCS at paras 121–127. The Receivers made demands and threats that had no basis in law 161 In respect of the plaintiffs’ submission that the Receivers made demands and threats that had no basis in law, the Receivers submit the following: (a) neither Ms Zhang or Mr Horikawa suggested that they were threatened or felt compelled to comply with the Receivers’ demands. The onus is on the directors to submit the Statement of Affairs;95Foot Note 95×2D3DCS at paras 141–147. (b) the plaintiffs have not pleaded any matters of Japanese law regarding the Receivers’ requests to Nishiki TMK and KMC for information nor adduced evidence of such;96Foot Note 96×2D3DCS at para 150.and (c) the Receivers had explained that they demanded for the share certificates because they only had sight of the share certificates for the one Singapore dollar share held by NH in each of NRE and NII, but not the shares in Japanese yen.",
