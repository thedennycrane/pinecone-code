        "BACKGROUND": "1.    The accused Ng Ah Kang faced two charges. The second\n\ncharge was stood down and the prosecution proceeded on the first charge.2.    Under the first charge (‘the Charge’), the\n\naccused was charged with the offence of importing into Singapore a controlled drug,\n\nspecified in Class A of the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act, Cap 185, on or\n\nabout 1 March 2001 at about 6.15am by having 31 packets of granular substance containing\n\nnot less than 610.15g of diamorphine in a motor car bearing registration number JFY 6358\n\n(‘the Car’) at Customs Examination Bay Green Channel Lane R2, Woodlands\n\nCheckpoint, Singapore.3.    The accused pleaded guilty to the Charge but the\n\nprosecution proceeded to prove its case.The Prosecution’s Case4.    On 1 March 2001 at about 6.15am, PW7 Chief Custom Officer\n\n(‘CCO’) Zainal Abiden Bin Atan stopped the Car driven by the accused while on\n\nduty at Customs Examinations Bay Green Channel Lane R2, Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore.\n\nIt was a red coloured Proton Wira.5.    Upon inspection of the boot of the Car, he noticed that the\n\nspeaker box was unusually big.6.    After a while, he noticed a hole on one side of the speaker. He\n\nput his finger into the hole and felt some plastic inside. He asked the accused what was\n\ninside the speaker box but the accused kept quiet. He then called PW10 Higher Customs\n\nOfficer (‘HCO’) Gopalan Nelakandan for assistance.7.    As HCO Gopalan was approaching the Car, he shouted something. The\n\naccused was running away from the Car.8.    Customs Officer (‘CO’) Shahriman Bin Daud gave chase\n\nwhile HCO Gopalan ran towards a Police Post to seek assistance.9.    CCO Abiden remained behind to guard the Car.10.    At about 6.45am both HCO Gopalan and CO Shahriman returned. They\n\nhad not been able to catch the accused.11.    Various packets of substance were found in the speaker box. Some\n\nwere the subject of the Charge.12.    Further searches for the accused were conducted.13.    The accused was subsequently found at about 9.35am of the same\n\nday in a manhole in an area of bushes near the exit of the Arrival Lorry Bay (‘the\n\nManhole’).14.    The accused was injured and was eventually lifted out of the\n\nManhole with the assistance of the Singapore Civil Defence Force.15.    The accused had entered Singapore using a Malaysian Passport\n\nbearing the name of Leong Chee Yoong and Passport Number A10636256 (Exhibit P80).16.    On the next day, a Malaysian Identity Card 581115-08-5277 and a\n\nMalaysian driving licence were some of the articles recovered from the Manhole where the\n\naccused was found. Both the identity card and driving licence bore the name Leong Chee\n\nYoong.Cautioned Statement by accused17.    In his cautioned statement given on 7 March 2001 between 1444\n\nhours and 1516 hours pursuant to s 122(6) of the Criminal Procedure Code (‘CPC’)\n\nCap 68 to Assistant Superintendent (‘ASP’) Toh Soon Teck, the accused said,\n\n‘I have nothing to say’. The statement was taken with the assistance of an\n\ninterpreter as the accused chose to speak in Hokkien.18.    The other statements referred to below were also taken with the\n\nassistance of an interpreter.Second statement from accused19.    ASP Toh recorded another statement from the accused under s 121\n\nof the CPC on 8 March 2001 at about 1435 hours.20.    The statement reads:‘ I am known as \"Ah Kiat\" to family and my friends.2 On 1 March 2001 at about 4 to 5 a.m., I drove my car, JFY 6358, to\n\n  the carpark of Sentosa Shopping Centre, Johor Bahru. I parked the car there and open the\n\n  car boot and walked away. After half an hour later, my handphone, number:012-7603551,\n\n  rang. I answered the call and the male voice spoke to me in Malay to the effect the things\n\n  were inside the car and I could drive off. I drove to a deserted place nearby. I opened\n\n  the car boot and saw a paper box. I opened the paper box and saw three different types of\n\n  wrappings. The first type was newspaper wrapping contained in plastic bags, the second\n\n  type was in polythene wrapping and the third type was wrapped in masking tape.3 I then opened the speaker box in the car boot and placed all the\n\n  wrappings into the speaker box. As I placed the wrappings into the speaker box, I counted\n\n  them. There were a total of 22 \"liap\" of newspaper wrapping in plastic bags, a\n\n  total of 9 \"liap\" of polythene wrappings and 5 \"liap\" of masking tape\n\n  wrapping. From the wrappings, I knew that the 22 \"liap\" and the 9\n\n  \"liap\" were all containing heroin and the 5 \"liap\" were containing\n\n  opium. I knew one \"liap\" of heroin is over 400 grams but I do not know the\n\n  weight of one \"liap\" of opium.4 I took about 10 minutes to put all the wrappings into the speaker\n\n  box. Then I fixed back the speaker box. After that I drove straight to Singapore. On\n\n  arriving Woodlands Checkpoint, I drove my car to the Immigration Counter whereby my\n\n  Malaysian forged passport was stamped. Then I drove into the bay for cars which had\n\n  nothing to declare. At that point, a male Malay officer in blue uniform asked me in Malay\n\n  to stopped my car. He told me to open the car boot and told me to get down of my car to\n\n  follow him to the car boot. I opened the car boot from the driver seat and alighted and\n\n  followed the officer to the car boot. He did a search in the boot and then asked me\n\n  whether the speaker box could be opened. I answered that it could not be opened. He then\n\n  walked to the car and searched the inside of the car. While searching, he asked me whether\n\n  there was anything inside the car and I said no. he found nothing and switched off my car\n\n  engine and went back to the car boot.5 The officer did another search in the boot. At this point, another\n\n  officer came to my car boot. He was a male Malay officer in blue uniform. The first\n\n  officer used his hand to fiddle with the speaker box and through a small opening, he\n\n  pulled out a newspaper wrapping contained in a plastic bag. He asked me what was it and I\n\n  replied that I did not know. He then continued to search the speaker box and I immediately\n\n  fled towards the direction of Singapore.’Third statement from the accused21.    ASP Toh recorded a third statement from the accused on 9 March\n\n2001 at about 1440 hours. This statement was recorded under s 121 of the CPC.22.    The statement reads:‘The statement recorded on 08.03.2001 @ Paragraph 1 to Paragraph 5\n\n  was read back to me in Hokkien and I affirmed it to be true and correct.6 I ran till I reached a slope where I dropped a shoe. I cannot\n\n  remember whether it was right or left shoe. Then I continued to run across a road meant\n\n  for lorries. I knew it was for lorries as I heard sound of lorry engines. After I reached\n\n  the other side of that road, there were some bushes. As I was trying to run across the\n\n  bushes, I slipped into a drain and rolled into a manhole. There were 2 levels inside the\n\n  manhole and I hit the metal railing at the first level and then fell onto the bottom\n\n  level. I felt painful all over my body and I could not move.7 At this point, I used my leather belt to tie on the metal railing to\n\n  try and hang myself. The buckle of the belt gave way and the leather belt slipped off. I\n\n  then fell onto the bottom level. After that I took off my shirt and tied to my leather\n\n  belt and try to hang myself again using the same method. I was again unsuccessful as I\n\n  struggled to breathe and the leather belt that was tied to my shirt slipped off again. I\n\n  laid on my back on the bottom of the manhole and sometime later I heard voices outside the\n\n  manhole. I shouted \"hello hello\" to get the attention from people outside the\n\n  manhole. A while later, a plain cloth officer and a fireman came down. They tied me to a\n\n  stretcher and lifted me out of the manhole. I was then conveyed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital\n\n  in an ambulance.

The statement was recorded under s 121 of the CPC.24.    The statement reads:‘The statement recorded on 09.03.2001 @ Paragraph 6 to Paragraph\n\n  18 was read back to me in Hokkien and I affirmed it to be true and correct.19 I am now shown RM 1550 which was recovered from my shirt pocket. The\n\n  money was left over from my mahjong winnings from gambling den in Johor Bahru. This money\n\n  is not from drug dealings.20 The Malaysian car JFY 6358 was bought sometime in January 2001. This\n\n  is a brand new Proton Wira and is not a stolen or second hand car. I paid RM 10,000 for\n\n  the downpayment. I cannot remember which finance company I had to pay my installments to.\n\n  I had not paid any installment yet. I had used the identity of Leong Chee Yoong to\n\n  purchase this car. I do not know whether there exists any Leong Chee Yoong in Malaysia or\n\n  not. The RM 10,000 which I used to pay for the down payment was money from my drug\n\n  dealings.21 The back set of my car cannot be opened to gain access to the\n\n  special compartment of speaker box where the drugs were hidden. This special compartment\n\n  could only be opened by pressing on two buttons located at the dashboard near the steering\n\n  wheel. This special compartment and the speaker box were installed in Johor Bahru by a car\n\n  accessories shop.22 My Malaysian drug supplier, \"Jimmy\" was introduced by a\n\n  Malaysian friend known to me as \"Ah Hor\". I do not have their contact numbers.\n\n  Whenever they need to find me, they call me at my Malaysian handphone, 012-7603551. That\n\n  was about 2 months ago. \"Jimmy\" asked to deliver drugs to Singapore. He would\n\n  pay me RM 800 for one \"liap\" of heroin and RM 1,200 for one \"liap\" of\n\n  opium delivered to Singapore. On the day of arrest, I brought in 31 \"liap\" of\n\n  heroin and 5 \"liap\" of opium and I would be paid a total of RM 30,800 for that\n\n  trip. I would be paid once I had delivered the drugs in Singapore and returned to Johor\n\n  Bahru. Since January 2001 until the day of arrest, I had delivered more than 10 occasions.\n\n  During those occasions, I had delivered heroin between 10 over \"liap\" and 20\n\n  over \"liap\" and on 3 or 4 occasions, I also delivered 4 to 5 \"liap\" of\n\n  opium together with the heroin. \"Jimmy\" would call me at my handphone to tell me\n\n  to collect the drugs from a carpark at Taman Sentosa Shopping Centre and then to deliver\n\n  to Singapore at various places arranged by him.23 On the day of my arrest, I was supposed to drive to Ang Mo Kio\n\n  Central carpark and wait for one unknown male Chinese to come to my car to pick up all the\n\n  drugs. My supplier had already told that person my car number and he would then wait for\n\n  me at the carpark. I would merely passed over the drugs to the person and not collect any\n\n  money from him. Someone else would collect money from him. I do not have his contact\n\n  number. Then I would return straight to Johor Bahru using the Woodlands Checkpoint.\n\n  Normally the following day I would receive my payments from \"Jimmy\".24 In the black travel bag with the word \"Garfield\", beside\n\n  the 9 \"liap\" of heroin, there was also a digital weighing scale which was\n\n  together with the heroin that I collected earlier. It was meant to be passed to the\n\n  unknown male Chinese in Ang Mo Kio Central carpark. I do not remember placing any glove\n\n  inside the travel bag.25 I am now informed that my urine was tested positive for Ecstasy. I\n\n  provided 4 bottles of urine for testing during my stay in Changi General Hospital. I admit\n\n  consuming Ecstasy while I was in Johor Bahru. The last occasion was at \"Tian\n\n  Huang\" nightclub in Johor Bahru two days before my arrest.26 I made about RM 150,000 for all the previous drug deliveries to\n\n  Singapore. I lost all the money on gambling as well as spending at nightclubs in Johor\n\n  Bahru.27 I was born in a family with 2 elder sisters and 4 younger sisters.\n\n  They are not involved in any criminal or drug activities. I studied at Li Hua Primary\n\n  school at Yio Chu Kang Road. I studied till Primary 5 and left school as I had no interest\n\n  in studies. I then worked in a timber factory located at Defu Lane for about a year. Then\n\n  I worked as a contract painter. After that I only worked as odd job laborer till now. I\n\n  only worked when there is work available. The rest of the time I spent in gambling on\n\n  horse and soccer. In 1974 I was arrested for secret society activities. I was involved in\n\n  the SS group \"Ling Hai San\". This SS group is not (sic) longer active. I then\n\n  reported for Police Supervision at Paya Laber Police Station for 3 years. My other\n\n  criminal records include armed robbery and gambling offences. I was placed under probation\n\n  for one year in 1978. After which I did not commit any more offence and I continue to work\n\n  as an odd job laborer.
