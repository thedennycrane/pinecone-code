        "(i)    Admitted\n\nitems": "13\n\n        The items in this category are the (a) Gibson\n\nGuitar; (b) two Khmer Statues; and (c) invoices, documents and photographs of the art\n\nobjects and sculptures (\"the Art Documents\"). Chew does not dispute Selby’s\n\nright to these items; her position is simply that she does not have them.14\n\n        The Gibson Guitar and two Khmer Statues were\n\nsupposed to have been moved by Helu-Trans, the movers engaged by Selby, from 2 to 4 July\n\n2001. The evidence shows that there was general pandemonium at the matrimonial home during\n\nthat period. But it was also compounded by the strained relationship between the parties.\n\nThere is also evidence that Chew made matters difficult for the movers by not permitting\n\nthem to photograph the art objects beforehand. However there is evidence that one of the\n\ntwo Khmer Statues, a stone Ganesh, was packed by the movers and shipped to Bangkok.\n\nSelby’s collection of more than 30 guitars was also mostly moved out that day. And\n\nthere is evidence that prior to 2 July Selby had taken away one or more guitars. On the\n\nbasis of all the evidence before me I am not satisfied that Selby has discharged the\n\nburden of proving that Chew has converted the Gibson Guitar and the two Khmer Statues.15\n\n        The Art Documents are invoices, receipts,\n\nphotographs, a catalogue book, written appraisals and test certificates relating to those\n\nart objects and sculptures that Selby would be entitled to under the Annexure. Selby said\n\nthat a folio file that contained the Art Documents was kept in the Matrimonial Home. He\n\nsaid that from 14 May 2001 he had no idea where the file was as Chew had removed all their\n\nfiles or locked them up. Selby explained that the records were necessary for insurance\n\npurposes and to provide him with a complete record of every art piece in his collection.16\n\n        On 22 June 2001, nine days before the movers\n\nwent in, Selby’s solicitors, DCC, wrote to HEP to ask for the Art Documents. HEP\n\nreplied on 25 June to say that they would be made available for Selby’s collection.\n\nThen in a letter from DCC to HEP dated 3 July 2001, the second day of the moving\n\noperation, the following statements are made:In your fax of 25 June 2001\n\n    … you said that the said documents could be collected at your office. When we went to\n\n    your office on 29 June 2001, we were told that the documents were not at your office but\n\n    that the same would be handed over to our clients personally when he went over to your\n\n    clients’ premises to supervise the movers on 2 July 2001. Our client went down at the\n\n    said premises yesterday but the said documents were not handed to him.The said documents are important\n\n    to our client in that the same would enable him to verify every piece of art sculpture (as\n\n    the said documents would include the relevant certificates and photographs) that are now\n\n    being packed and moved.We hereby demand the immediate\n\n    surrender of the said documents to us as solicitors within the next twenty-four (24)\n\n    hours.We need not tell you that the\n\n    said art sculptures are extremely valuable and rare. Our client will hold your client\n\n    wholly liable for any loss and damage suffered by him by the delay or your client’s\n\n    refusal to surrender the same immediately.17\n\n        On 3 July 2001 Chew handed to one of the movers\n\na bundle of documents comprising some 20 pages. Selby confirmed that this was a part of\n\nthe Art Documents but claimed that there were many more documents. He said that the\n\ndocuments handed over did not include a single photograph of the Khmer sculptures which\n\nformed a large part of his collection.18\n\n        On 6 July 2001 DCC wrote to HEP to state that\n\nthe documents handed over were incomplete and demanded the complete set to be handed over\n\nby Chew. HEP replied on 10 July to say that there were no pictures or invoices of the\n\nKhmer sculptures. On 12 July DCC replied to reiterate their position that Chew was in\n\npossession of the remaining documents.19\n\n        Chew gave evidence that she did not have the\n\nArt Documents. She said that as far as she was aware, Selby had removed all his personal\n\nbelongings including his documents and files from the matrimonial home. She recalled that\n\nSelby had returned to the matrimonial home on one occasion on 29 May 2001 specifically to\n\ncollect his files and other documents. However in the next breath, she said that she had\n\nhanded over a file containing some documents and photographs to the movers. Selby pointed\n\nout that if Chew could produce part of the Art Documents, it confirmed that she had the\n\ncomplete set of documents in her possession.20\n\n        On a consideration of the evidence in its\n\nentirety, I find that Chew had retained the Art Documents.",
        "(ii)    Items not\n\nin Annexure": "21\n\n        The items in this category are the (a) Han\n\nDynasty Bronze Horse and Cart and five Pre-Han Dynasty Bronze Bells (collectively,\n\n\"the Bronzes\"); (b) telescope; (c) Hyacinth Macaw; and (d) three Sapphire\n\ngemstones (\"the Gemstones\").22\n\n        Selby claimed that the Bronzes were purchased\n\nby him personally and were at all times kept in the matrimonial home. Chew’s version\n\nis rather inconsistent. DCC first demanded for the Bronzes in their letter to HEP of 19\n\nJuly 2001. HEP’s reply of 20 July asserts that they were not specified in the\n\nAnnexure nor were they \"personal assets\" within item 55 of the Annexure which\n\ncovers\"clothes, shoes, socks, cufflinks, toiletries, watches, computers …,\n\nnovels (fiction)\". HEP said that they would take instruction from Chew as to\n\nwhether she was prepared to let Selby have them. Those instructions were eventually taken\n\nand HEP wrote on 17 August to inform DCC that Chew was not prepared to do so. There\n\nmatters remained until the suits were filed. It was then that Chew revealed in her Defence\n\nthat the Bronzes were the assets of Sablowsky and Tang, a partnership dealing in antiques\n\nowned by Chew and one Tang Kok Foo.23\n\n        I would have gone into the details of\n\nChew’s evidence in relation to the ownership of the Bronzes had it been necessary to\n\ndo so. It is not for the reason set out in the following paragraph, but I cannot leave\n\nthis aspect without commenting that I am not satisfied with the inconsistency of the\n\nevidence given by her. If the Bronzes were not matrimonial assets but owned by Sablowsky\n\nand Tang, it is puzzling that she did not mention it at the outset. This parsimonious\n\nattitude towards revelation of the true picture has been displayed at other times as well\n\nand is one of the factors that led me to conclude that her evidence is unreliable.\n\nSelby’s counsel had also pointed out that Sablowsky and Tang’s accounts did not\n\ncount the Bronzes among their inventory, although Chew gave an explanation which I need\n\nnot go into.24\n\n        The claim for the Bronzes can easily be settled\n\nbecause of the simple fact that they were not included in the Annexure. On Selby’s\n\ncase, they were purchased during the marriage and kept in the matrimonial home. The\n\nAnnexure gives a rather detailed list of what art objects he was entitled to under the\n\nDeed. Therefore it was clearly within the contemplation of the agreement embodied in the\n\nDeed that the Bronzes would not go to him. In the premises, I find that Selby is not\n\nentitled to the Bronzes.25\n\n        Chew’s counsel submitted that the\n\nremaining items, viz. the (b) telescope; (c) Hyacinth Macaw; and (d) three gem stones\n\nshould also be determined in like manner. As they were not listed in the Annexure, Selby\n\nis not entitled to them. The issue turns on the construction of paragraph 17(J) of the\n\nDeed which provides as follows:The Husband agrees to only remove\n\n    all his personal belongings, such art collection and moveable propertyas described in\n\n    the annexurehereto by 31 July 2001.The issue is whether the words\n\n\"as described in the annexure\" qualifies \"personal belongings\". In my\n\nview the word \"such\" before \"art collection and moveable property\"\n\ndelinks \"personal belongings\" from \"as described in the annexure\".\n\nThis would mean that Selby is entitled to remove all of his personal belongings (not\n\notherwise excepted by the remaining terms of the Deed, such as objects of art) from the\n\nmatrimonial home by 31 July 2001. It would also mean that he would not be entitled to any\n\npersonal belonging not removed by that date, save those that he was prevented from\n\nremoving by Chew. I turn to examine whether the three remaining items are Selby's personal\n\nbelongings.26\n\n        In respect of the telescope, Selby said that he\n\nhad purchased it for himself from the Singapore Science Centre. Selby had initially\n\nwrongly described the telescope but I find that it was a genuine error given the torrent\n\nof events in that period. Chew claimed that Selby had purchased it for use of the family\n\nand that their children had made use of it. Selby pointed out that apart from the fact\n\nthat it is a large and heavy instrument, it is also a sophisticated telescope with a motor\n\nthat compensated for the rotation of the earth to keep the telescope pointed at fixed\n\nposition in the sky. He pointed out that at the time of its purchase, the children were\n\naged five and two years and would not have been able to operate nor appreciate this type\n\nof telescope. I accept Selby's evidence and find that the telescope is part of his\n\npersonal belongings. As he had demanded it on 5 July 2001 and Chew had refused to return\n\nit to him, I find that Selby is entitled to possession of the telescope.27\n\n        I turn to the Macaw. The original claim was for\n\ntwo Macaws but in the course of the trial, at my suggestion Chew agreed to return one of\n\nthem, a Military Macaw, without prejudice to her position. Selby accepted it, also without\n\nprejudice to his position. The claim therefore becomes that of the remaining Macaw, a\n\nHyacinth. Selby had given evidence that he had purchased them from a bird shop in the\n\nUnited States and had imported them to Singapore. They were juvenile birds at the time and\n\nhe had raised and trained them. Chew claimed that she had bought the birds from a bird\n\nshop in Singapore and that they were family pets. As they were not covered by the\n\nAnnexure, Selby was not entitled to them.28\n\n        I should point out that this is another\n\ninstance of Chew’s inconsistent positions. On 2 July 2001, when he went to the\n\nmatrimonial home to direct the movers, Selby discovered the Macaws missing from their\n\ncages. On 5 July 2001 DCC wrote to HEP to inquire as to their whereabouts in the following\n\nmanner:The 2 macaws were missing from\n\n    their cages and our client demands to know what your client did to the birds. We are\n\n    instructed that the value of the 2 macaws is about US$20,000 and one of which is extremely\n\n    rare. Our client’s rights in this regard are also reserved.In their reply, HEP said as\n\nfollows:Please note that the macaws and\n\n    the other birds, dogs and hamsters are all family pets and are not in the list and neither\n\n    are they your client’s personal belongings. For your client’s information, the\n\n    birds do not cost USD20,000 each. This could be the reason your client did not include the\n\n    birds in the [Annexure] in the first place.By letter dated 9 July 2001 DCC\n\nrepeated the request to know what Chew had done to the Macaws but the reply from HEP on 10\n\nJuly evaded the question by repeating that they were matrimonial assets not in the list\n\nand therefore there was no need to reply to the query. The request was repeated on 12 July\n\nwith DCC asking specifically what Chew had done to the birds. There was no further\n\nresponse from HEP on this issue.29\n\n        In her affidavit evidence in chief, Chew had\n\nsaid as follows at paragraphs 29 and 30:29. The 2 Macaws are the pets of\n\n    the family. They have been with the family for about 6 to 7 years now. They did not belong\n\n    to the Plaintiff. As such, the Plaintiff is not entitled to the 2 Macaws.30. The 2 Macaws were not listed\n\n    in the [Annexure] and were not removed from the matrimonial home by the Plaintiff.In those paragraphs, Chew states\n\nher position that the Macaws are family pets and have been for the past six or seven\n\nyears. The clear implication is that she still has the birds and intend to retain them and\n\ntherefore Selby ought not to have them. In the course of the trial, her counsel revealed\n\nthat she had given the birds away to a friend. Chew sought to correct her affidavit by\n\nchanging the tense of paragraph 29, but this was only done after the revelation that the\n\nMacaws had been given away. In cross-examination, she admitted that the Macaws were given\n\naway sometime between 15 June 2001, when the Decree Nisi was granted, and 2 July. It\n\nturned out that the friend she had given the birds to, Chua Ka Soon, was also a pet shop\n\nowner who sold birds. She had managed to get back the Military Macaw from Chua but was\n\nunable to do so in respect of the Hyacinth Macaw.30\n\n        On the evidence before me I have no hesitation\n\nin holding that the Hyacinth Macaw is part of Selby’s personal belongings to which he\n\nis entitled and that Chew had converted it.31\n\n        In respect of the Gemstones, DCC first asserted\n\nSelby’s claim to them by letter dated 22 June 2001. That letter stated as follows:We are instructed that the\n\n    following gem stones were kept in a safe in your client’s premises:-a) A 4-carat Cabachon Sapphire\n\n    which was purchased in 1980. The gem stone was set in a men’s ring. Approximate value\n\n    is about US$20,000.00;b) A 4-carat Sri Lanka Sapphire\n\n    which our client received as a gift in 1985. This too was set in a men’s ring and is\n\n    approximately valued at US$45,000.00; andc) A Kashmiri Cabachon Sapphire\n\n    (comes with a Gueblin Certificate) which our client bought in 1986. Approximate value\n\n    US$30,000.00.…Your client will no doubt make\n\n    the above items available for our client’s collection.32\n\n        HEP replied on 25 June to say that the\n\nGemstones belonged to Chew because Selby had given them to her during the marriage as he\n\ndid not want them. On 5 July 2001 Chew asserted, through a letter from HEP, that the\n\nKashmiri Sapphire was purchased after their marriage. This position was reaffirmed in\n\nHEP’s letter of 10 July in which it was claimed that the Gemstones were\"matrimonial\n\nassets purchased during the marriage\". However in her affidavit evidence in\n\nchief, Chew said that the Kashmiri Sapphire was given to her by Selby as a wedding gift.\n\nAdditionally this assertion does not accord with the fact that it is an unset stone, a\n\nrather odd wedding gift to give. It should be noted that there were other jewellery that\n\nSelby had given to Chew as wedding gifts.33\n\n        As for the other two sapphires, Chew denied\n\nthat they were men’s settings in her affidavit evidence in chief and asserted that\n\nthey were originally set in ladies’ rings. Yet in a letter from HEP dated 5 July\n\n2001, she had asserted that they were \"re-set\" as lady’s rings. Paragraph 8\n\nof that letter states as follows:Gem stones (2 blue sapphires)\n\n    given to our client in the early days of the marriage were re-set for our clients as\n\n    lady’s rings. Your client is fully aware of this fact.34\n\n        To support her case, Chew produced two invoices\n\nfrom Gee Wee Jewellery in respect of the setting of the rings, which are dated 8 September\n\n1994 and 17 February 1996. It was pointed out to her in cross-examination that the\n\ninvoices were inherently suspicious because they use the 6 digit postal code which were\n\nonly introduced after the invoice dates. In re-examination Chew explained that she had\n\nasked Gee Wee Jewellery in early 2002 for copies of her receipts and those were what they\n\nhad given her. She had, of course omitted to disclose this fact in her evidence up to that\n\npoint and only chose to do so after the discrepancy about the postal code was pointed out.35\n\n        From totality of the evidence, I believe\n\nSelby’s case concerning the Gemstones, that they had been purchased by him before the\n\nmarriage and that they remained his personal belongings.",
        "(iii)    Amex Card": "36\n\n        In paragraph 19 of the Deed, Chew agreed that\n\nSelby could terminate all her credit cards and charge cards that are supplementary to his\n\ncards upon approval of the Deed by the Court. It provides as follows:The Husband shall terminate all\n\n    supplementary credit or charge cards taken out by him for the benefit of the Wife upon the\n\n    approval of this Deed by the Court.However the Deed is silent on the\n\nextent to which Chew was entitled to use her supplementary cards during this period.\n\nIndeed on 16 May 2001, while the terms of the Deed were being negotiated, Selby instructed\n\nAmex to terminate Chew’s supplementary card. However on 17 May he reinstated it. It\n\nshould be recalled that the Deed was signed shortly thereafter, and dated 24 May 2001. It\n\nfalls to be considered as to what is the agreement between the parties as to this\n\nprovision.37\n\n        As it would be patently absurd to suggest that\n\nthey had agreed that Chew could expend any amount she wished, it is a necessary\n\nimplication of paragraph 19 of the Deed that the card may only be used for the family and\n\nher ordinary personal expenses until reasonable provision could be made in relation to her\n\nmaintenance. On 24 May 2001, Selby paid to Chew a sum of $38,000 pursuant to an agreement\n\nreached on 23 May, as an interim arrangement until the Court’s approval of the Deed.\n\nAlthough this agreement was reached in consideration of Chew consenting to release a\n\ncertain sum of money residing in the bank account of a company called Adavale Management\n\nLimited, it is clear in the context that it is related to interim maintenance rather than\n\nsome sort of ransom for the release of those funds as Chew’s counsel appears to\n\nsuggest.38\n\n        I therefore hold that it was an implied term of\n\nthe agreement to pay interim maintenance that Chew would reimburse Selby in respect of the\n\nexpenses incurred on her supplementary Amex card after 24 May 2001. Accordingly she is\n\nliable to reimburse Selby for the sum of $19,028.11 incurred by her between 24 May and 15\n\nJune 2001.",
        "(iv)    Wine": "39\n\n        Selby claimed that Chew directed the movers to\n\ntake all the wine that were stored in the guest bungalow. He said that those were the\n\ncheaper wine as he had kept the bottles meant for long-term storage at that location.\n\nSelby said that the more expensive wine were kept in the main house. Chew had no interest\n\nin wine and it was Selby who purchased and built up the wine collection. On my view of the\n\nrelative credibility of the protagonists, and taking into consideration Selby’s\n\nevidence that there is a considerable variation in the value of the wine in his\n\ncollection, I find that the agreement was for division in the ratio of 3 to 1 by value\n\nrather than random bottles. Therefore there should be an account rendered by Chew on the\n\nbottles of wine retained by her.40\n\n        For completeness I make the following\n\nsubsidiary findings of fact. I find that Selby did receive 614 bottles. I find also that\n\nthe wine that he consumed with his friends during the latter half of May and early June\n\n2001 were white wine that came from the fridge in the kitchen and not from the wine\n\ncollection.(v)    Company\n\nKits41\n\n        Selby had purchased the Companies as shelf\n\ncompanies for the purpose of holding the substantial assets he had acquired over the\n\nyears. Chew was the sole director of the Companies at all material times. Selby gave\n\nevidence that they used the matrimonial home as the mailing address of the Companies and\n\nall correspondence to the Companies, including the bank statements, were sent there. He\n\nsaid that these documents, together with all other company records, namely, registers,\n\narticles of association and memorandum and company seals were kept in the study room in\n\nthe main house in Chew’s sole custody. He claimed that Chew kept them in a locked\n\ndesk drawer to which only she had the key.42\n\n        Chew denied that she has the company kits. She\n\nclaimed that Selby must have removed them from the matrimonial home as he had access to\n\nthe home and the documents at the material time and was in fact moving out many of his\n\ndocuments well before the movers came in early July 2001.43\n\n        Selby deposed to a number of factors which\n\nindicate that Chew had the documents she now disclaims. Some of the more significant ones\n\nare as follows:(i) At the time of the\n\n    negotiations of the terms of the Deed, between 16 and 24 May 2001, Chew was able to\n\n    produce the bank statements of Whitham Enterprises Ltd and Silver Falcon Ltd for\n\n    Selby’s inspection. This is embodied in paragraph 17(D) of the Deed which reads:\"The\n\n    latest bank statement of April 2001 which has been inspected by both parties shall be\n\n    accepted as conclusive evidence of the amount in Accounts no. 685371 and 685370\n\n    …\".(ii) Chew filed an affidavit on\n\n    18 September 2001 in connection with the divorce petition in which she exhibited copies of\n\n    the United States tax returns from 1995 to 1998 of Hillfield International Ltd, the first\n\n    Plaintiff in Suit No 1200 of 2001.(iii) Immediately prior to the\n\n    transfer of Chew’s share of the US$60 million under paragraph 17(C) of the Deed, DCC\n\n    wrote to the HEP on 15 June 2001 to request for the up-dated bank statement. At that time,\n\n    the Defendant had obtained or would soon obtain up-dated bank statements that would show\n\n    the amount of interest earned since 24 May, which was expected to be a fairly substantial\n\n    sum. Chew however did not furnish the bank statements. HEP wrote to DCC on 18 and 19 June\n\n    2001 giving a precise breakdown of interest and the monies and other deposits in the\n\n    accounts, showing that Chew had in her possession, the bank statements of the Companies.44\n\n        Counsel for Selby also highlighted several\n\nadditional factors pointing to Chew having possession of the company kits:(i) Chew was able to produce in\n\n    her September 2001 affirmation various documents relating to the transfer of monies from\n\n    Whitham to pay for renovations at the Bangkok condominium;(ii) There were many transfers of\n\n    monies from the Companies’ accounts to Chew’s own account and this indicates\n\n    that she had a motive in withholding the companies’ documents.(iii) On 26 April 2001, Chew\n\n    instructed Citibank to retain all statements in respect of the Companies’ accounts so\n\n    that they would not be sent to the matrimonial home as would ordinarily have been done.\n\n    She gave this rather doubtful reason for making that instruction:After I---I signed the\n\n    Hold-All-Mail Agreement because at that time, I had received three phone calls from Thai\n\n    women to my house, disturbing my children’s life, disturbing my life. By that time,\n\n    my husband was always in Bangkok on the weekend. And after the calls that came to the\n\n    house, after I questioned and asked for the local mobile phone, after he switched to a\n\n    Thai local phone so that Pauline Han would not be able to give me phone bills. After all\n\n    that, I put in the Hold-Mail on the 26th April of 2001. I removed the power of attorney on\n\n    the day that he walked out and I believe that would be May 10th.45\n\n        I am satisfied on a consideration of all the\n\nevidence before me that Chew had converted the company kits.",
        "Orders": "46\n\n        Following from the findings made above, I make\n\nthe following orders:(1)    Chew shall\n\n    return the following items to Selby:(i) the Telescope;(ii) the Hyacinth Macaw;(iii) the three Sapphires\n\n      gemstones produced by Chew at the trial and as identified by her; and(iv) All invoices, documents and\n\n      photographs taken on the art objects and sculptures belonging to Selby.(2) Should Chew fail to return\n\n    item (ii) or (iii) above to Selby within one month of this judgment, she shall pay damages\n\n    assessed as follows:(a) US$10,000 for the Hyacinth\n\n      Macaw;(b) US$20,000 for the 4-carat\n\n      Cabochon Sapphire, US$45,000.00 for the 4-carat Sri Lanka Sapphire and US$30,000.00 for\n\n      the Kashimiri Cabochon Sapphire.(3) Should Chew fail to return\n\n    item (iv) above to Selby within one month of this judgment, then there shall be an order\n\n    to pay such damages as shall be assessed by the Registrar.(4) Chew shall render an account\n\n    of the wines retained by her from Selby’s wine collection and should their value\n\n    exceed 25% of the value of the entire wine collection, she shall deliver up wine in excess\n\n    of this value or, at her option, pay a sum equivalent to such excess value. The valuation\n\n    shall be made by a valuer to be agreed between the parties, failing which there shall be\n\n    an inquiry before the Registrar.(5) There shall be judgment for\n\n    the sum of $19,028.11 in respect of the amount incurred by Chew on her supplementary\n\n    American Express charge card.(6) Chew shall hand over the\n\n    company kits to the three Companies. Should she fail to do so within one month of this\n\n    judgment, there shall be an inquiry as to damages and an order for payment of the sum\n\n    assessed.47\n\n        In crafting the above orders, I have\n\nendeavoured to minimise future clashes in court as this will be detrimental to the\n\nchildren of the protagonists. On the question of costs, I am of the view that the primary\n\nconsideration should be the children in view of the fact that both Selby and Chew have\n\nenough money to take their quarrels to the courts for a long time to come. This will\n\naggravate the emotional harm already inflicted upon their children and I have no wish to\n\nsee that happen, nor pander to any inclination on the part of either of them to resort to\n\nthe legal process unnecessarily. Accordingly the most appropriate order for costs to make\n\nin this case would be to order that all parties in these consolidated actions bear their\n\nown costs.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSUPREME COURTCopyright © Government of Singapore."
