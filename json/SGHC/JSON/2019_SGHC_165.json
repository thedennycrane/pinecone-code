        "Introduction": "1 The plaintiffs, Zillion Global Limited and Fields Pacific Limited (“Zillion” and “Fields” respectively, and “the Plaintiffs” collectively), are companies incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. At all material times, the beneficial owner of the Plaintiffs was Mr Pan Fang-Jen (“Pan”), and their purpose was to hold his assets. The Plaintiffs were customers of the Private Wealth Management (“PWM”) division of the defendant, Deutsche Bank AG, Singapore Branch (“DB”).1Foot Note 1×See Statement of Claim (Amendment No 2) (“SOC”) at para 6; Defence (Amendment No 3) (“Defence”) at para 11.The Plaintiffs had opened both discretionary accounts and advisory accounts (also known as non-discretionary accounts) with DB. The key difference between these two types of accounts was that for a discretionary account, the bank exercised its own discretion in deciding which transactions to enter into, but for an advisory account, the client made the decision as to which transactions to enter into. This suit is concerned primarily with the advisory accounts the Plaintiffs had with DB,ie, (i) Zillion’s advisory account; (ii) a foreign exchange margin trading account (“FX GEM account”) which was linked to Zillion’s advisory account; and (iii) Fields’ advisory account. These three accounts will be referred to as “the Accounts”. 2 I make a preliminary point (on which I elaborate at [13] below) that in advancing their respective cases in their pleadings and submissions to this court, the parties generally did not draw a distinction between the Plaintiffs, or between the Accounts, should there be any distinction to draw. Since the parties chose to advance their cases as such, I will proceed on the basis that the arguments advanced by the Plaintiffs and by DB respectively applied to the Plaintiffs and the Accounts without distinction. I will also refer to Pan and the Plaintiffs interchangeably unless the context requires a distinction to be drawn between them. 3 The Plaintiffs filed the writ of summons on 3 July 2014 against DB. They had four main heads of claim against DB, namely, for: (a) breach of an implied term of the relevant contracts generally; (b) negligence generally; (c) misrepresentation on 30 July 2008 and 31 July 2008; and (d) breach of contract on 13 October 2008. 4 DB relied on contract terms in its defence to exclude or restrict its liability. DB also pleaded that the Plaintiffs’ actions founded on contract and on tort in respect of and/or relating to any matter in the Accounts that had arisen prior to 3 July 2008 had accrued more than six years before the time the Plaintiffs filed the writ of summons, and were barred by virtue of s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act (Cap 163, 1996 Rev Ed). 5 The trial for this suit was bifurcated. I heard the trial on liability over the course of 18 days, and reserved judgment.",

        "Background and the opening of accounts with DB and other banks": "7 Pan was born in the People’s Republic of China in 1941. He emigrated to the Republic of China (“Taiwan”) with his parents when he was about seven years old. At all material times, he was a citizen and resident of Taiwan. He graduated from junior middle school in Taiwan but did not do well enough to progress to senior middle school. He enrolled in a vocational institute named World College of Journalism. As an adult, he was involved in many different business ventures. However, it was his coal business and property-related investments that made him his wealth.2Foot Note 2×See Pan’s affidavit dated 1 February 2018 (“Pan’s affidavit”) at paras 4, 5, 10, 16, 21.At the material time, he was a retired businessman and a high net worth individual.3Foot Note 3×See SOC at paras 3–4; Defence at paras 3–4.The Plaintiffs averred that Pan was not proficient in English and could not read, speak or understand English save for simple words;4Foot Note 4×SOC at para 10.DB disputed this and averred that while Pan preferred to converse in Mandarin, he was able to converse in English.5Foot Note 5×See Defence at para 23. 8 Before November 2006, Pan had both discretionary and advisory accounts with other banks, namely, Citigroup Private Bank (“Citibank”) and JP Morgan, and he invested substantial sums with each of these banks.6Foot Note 6×See Defence at para 7(a); Reply (Amendment No 3) (“Reply”) at para 6(a); 60Agreed Bundle (“AB”) 46495–46496.These accounts were opened in his name and in the names of companies of which he was the beneficial owner and which included the Plaintiffs.7Foot Note 7×See Pan’s affidavit at para 34. 9 On or about 14 November 2006, DB approached Pan in Taipei, Taiwan to introduce its PWM services to him.8Foot Note 8×See SOC at paras 13–14; Defence at paras 8(b), 13.DB was represented by,inter alia, Juan and Tsang who were both conversant in Mandarin.9Foot Note 9×SOC at para 14; Defence at para 13. 10 In the following months, Pan opened both discretionary and advisory accounts with DB in the names of the Plaintiffs. A total of five accounts were opened (including the Accounts as mentioned at [1] above). Juan became the Relationship Manager for all five accounts.10Foot Note 10×SOC at para 14; Defence at para 13.The five accounts opened were: (a) an advisory account in Fields’ name opened on or around 20 December 2006;11Foot Note 11×See SOC at para 21; Defence at paras 21, 26(a). (b) an advisory account in Zillion’s name opened on or around 22 March 2007,12Foot Note 12×See SOC at para 23; Defence at paras 21, 26(b).and the linked FX GEM account in Zillion’s name opened on 24 May 2007;13Foot Note 13×See Defence at para 26(b).and (c) two discretionary accounts in Zillion’s name opened on 22 March 2007.14Foot Note 14×See SOC at para 24; Defence at para 21. 11 Although the Plaintiffs had pleaded that their claims were in relation to all five accounts,15Foot Note 15×See SOC at para 28.Pan agreed during cross-examination that the Plaintiffs’ claims were in fact in relation to only three of these accounts: the advisory accounts and the linked FX GEM account, which are those listed at [10(a)] and [10(b)] above.16Foot Note 16×See Notes of Evidence of 27 February 2018 at p 82 lines 14–19.As mentioned at [1] above, these three accounts will be referred to as “the Accounts”. The Plaintiffs’ claims were not in relation to the two discretionary accounts listed at [10(c)] above. 12 When opening the Accounts, the Plaintiffs executed,inter alia, the following contractual documents:17Foot Note 17×See Defence at para 28; Reply at para 21. (a) Service Agreement: executed by Zillion on 22 March 2007 and by Fields on 20 December 2006;18Foot Note 18×See 7AB 4650–4660. (b) Risk Disclosure Statement: executed by Zillion on 22 March 2007 and by Fields on 20 December 2006;19Foot Note 19×See 7AB 4486, 4510–4515. (c) DB Master Agreement for Foreign Exchange Transactions and Derivatives Transactions (“Master Agreement”): executed by Zillion on 26 February 2008;20Foot Note 20×7AB 4605–4619.and (d) Risk Disclosure Statement (Foreign Exchange and Derivative Transactions) (“Risk Disclosure Statement (FX)”): executed by Zillion on 26 February 2008.21Foot Note 21×7AB 4598–4604. 13 As I mentioned at [2] above, I observe that in advancing their respective cases in their pleadings and submissions to this court, the parties generally did not draw a distinction between the Plaintiffs, or between the Accounts, should there be any distinction to draw. This lack of precision is odd, considering how some of the contractual documents were executed by Zillion only and not by Fields, like the Master Agreement and the Risk Disclosure Statement (FX). By way of another example, the three margin call letters which will be discussed later were also addressed to Zillion and not to Fields. However, since the parties chose to advance their cases as described, I will proceed on the basis that the arguments advanced by the Plaintiffs and by DB respectively applied to the Plaintiffs and the Accounts without distinction. Accordingly, I will proceed on the basis that the contractual documents and all other matters in question also applied to the Plaintiffs and the Accounts without distinction. 14 Returning to the chronology, around December 2006 and in 2007, Pan also opened both discretionary and advisory accounts in his name and in the Plaintiffs’ names with another bank, the Union Bank of Switzerland (“UBS”).22Foot Note 22×See Defence at para 7(d); Reply at para 6(a); Pan’s affidavit at para 34; 60AB 46496.",
        "Pan’s relationship with DB and his investment objective": "15 In relation to the Accounts, DB introduced financial products to Pan and/or the Plaintiffs as part of its PWM services.23Foot Note 23×See Defence at para 54(c).DB and Pan had almost weekly meetings,24Foot Note 24×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 22.and from December 2006 to 13 October 2008, DB had almost daily telephone discussions with Pan and/or his staff (including Chang and Chen).25Foot Note 25×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at paras 22, 24.These meetings and telephone conversations were generally conducted in Mandarin. In these proceedings, DB produced in evidence voice logs of the telephone conversations of around 86 days.26Foot Note 26×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 24. 16 From January 2007 to September 2008, Pan injected approximately US$360m worth of assets and cash into the Accounts.27Foot Note 27×See SOC at para 41; Defence at para 46. 17 As regards Pan and his investment objective, the Plaintiffs pleaded that Pan was an investor with no sophistication in respect of financial investments, and that his financial objective was to preserve his wealth and protect it from depreciation.28Foot Note 28×SOC at para 4.DB disputed this. DB pleaded that Pan was an experienced and sophisticated investor, who was also speculative and aggressive, with the growth of his wealth as his investment objective.29Foot Note 29×Defence at paras 4(c)–4(d).DB alleged that Pan exercised his own judgement and made his own decisions as to which transactions to enter into under the Accounts.30Foot Note 30×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 20. 18 For example, Yim’s unchallenged description of Pan as set out in Yim’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief (“AEIC”) at paras 26–27 was as follows: 26. Indeed, at the meetings I attended, Mr Pan frequently emphasised that he did not require us to remind him of his potential exposures and that he had enough money to enter into the investments/trades that he wished to. If the Bank were not prepared to enter into the investments/trades, he would find another bank to do so. He was aware of the risks and exposures but he felt that he had enough money to ride out any market adversities. 27. Another constant characteristic of our meetings was that whenever the Bank presented our views to Mr Pan, he did not accept them unquestioningly.He had a very sharp and critical mindand would often challenge our views, anddebated with us. For instance, if we were of the view that a particular country’s interest rates would be cut, he would ask us to justify our view and challenge our assumptions or inferences. Mr Pan would alsocompareour investment ideas with that of his other private bankers (e.g., from Citibank or JPMorgan).I often found the discussions with Mr Pan intellectually challenging and stimulating.Mr Pan was savvy about the financial markets. For instance, he had insightful views about the debt situation in the U.S., the growth of China and the performance of commodities. Mr Pan’s challenges were one of the main reasons why our meetings would take such a long time. [emphasis added] 19 In terms of the documentation at the material time, Juan filled in, on behalf of DB, the “Client Acceptance & Profile Report” (“CAPR”) for Pan twice.31Foot Note 31×See Notes of Evidence of 22 March 2018 (“NEs 22/03/18”) at p 114 lines 14–16.The two CAPRs were completed internally within DB, without obtaining “confirmation” from Pan as to their contents.32Foot Note 32×See Plaintiffs’ Reply Closing Submissions at para 26(a).The details concerning the two CAPRs are as follows: (a) Initially in the CAPR dated 26 January 2007,33Foot Note 33×7AB 4497–4503.Pan’s objective for investable assets was described as “Balanced”.34Foot Note 34×7AB 4501.This meant that he was an investor who was “prepared to accept risk of infrequent and modest losses”, and was “[s]eeking total return both from income and capital appreciation”.35Foot Note 35×7AB 4501. (b) However, in the CAPR dated 24 April 2008,36Foot Note 36×7AB 4630–4640.Pan’s risk profile was no longer described as “Balanced” but described as “Growth (higher risk/ possible higher return)” instead.37Foot Note 37×7AB 4636.This meant that he was an investor who was “prepared to accept risk of market-like losses in line with those of the equity markets and who intend[ed] to meet the possibility of significant short-term fluctuations by long-term investments”, and was “[s]eeking total return mainly via capital appreciation”, where “[l]iquidity [was] of no primary concern”.38Foot Note 38×7AB 4636. (c) Pan’s risk profile was never described in either of the two CAPRs as “Conservative (lower risk/ lower return)”, which was the third and remaining descriptor, and would have meant that he was a “[r]isk-averse investor who [sought] not to incur risk or losses”, and was “[s]eeking stability and liquidity through current income and/ or modest return on capital”.39Foot Note 39×7AB 4501, 4636. 20 A Risk Profile Questionnaire dated 19 August 2008 was also completed in respect of Pan (“Questionnaire”),40Foot Note 40×7AB 4641–4644.which Sze believed Juan completed on behalf of DB.41Foot Note 41×See Sze’s affidavit dated 1 February 2018 (“Sze’s affidavit”) at para 15.The Questionnaire was also completed internally within DB, without obtaining “confirmation” from Pan as to its contents.42Foot Note 42×See Plaintiffs’ Reply Closing Submissions at para 26(a).The Questionnaire stated that Pan’s risk rating was “5”, which “indicated an aggressive risk profile and [that] the client was seeking capital growth”.43Foot Note 43×7AB 4644; see Sze’s affidavit at para 15. 21 Whilst the two CAPRs and the Questionnaire were completed internally within DB, they reflected DB’s assessment of Pan’s risk profile, regardless as to whether or not that was in fact his risk profile. It would appear that DB did not think of Pan’s investment objective as being to preserve his wealth and to protect it from depreciation. 22 On the other hand, the Plaintiffs highlighted a telephone conversation held on 6 December 2010 at or around 1pm primarily between Pan and Juan to support the Plaintiffs’ submission that Pan’s investment objective was simply to preserve his wealth.44Foot Note 44×See 59AB 46180–46298; Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 234.It was recorded in the English translation of the transcript for this conversation that Juan replied “Yes” to a series of Pan’s statements where he said: “What I want is not about the profit”, “My main aim is not to shrink my asset” and “How not to decrease the value, it’s my biggest wish”.45Foot Note 45×See 59AB 46261–46262.It does not appear to me that Juan was affirming these statements that Pan made, but rather that she was just noting that he was making these statements. In any case, this conversation took place in December 2010, more than two years after the time the Plaintiffs pleaded that DB allegedly closed out certain positions under the Accounts in breach of contract on 31 October 2008 (see [70(d)] below). I thus place little weight on this conversation of 6 December 2010 in understanding what Pan’s objective was in relation to the Accounts at the material time. 23 I make some observations on Pan as an investor. 24 I find that Pan was evasive during cross-examination when answering questions from DB’s counsel on the transactions the Plaintiffs entered into under the Accounts. This was so even when Pan was specifically referred to transcripts for telephone conversations between him and DB, and was asked questions on the contents of these transcripts.46Foot Note 46×Seeeg, Notes of Evidence of 6 March 2018 at pp 21–27 referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 51.I find that Pan was trying to portray himself as an investor who was fully dependent on DB’s advice as to which transactions to enter into under the Accounts when in fact this was not the case. 25 I find that Pan had a mind of his own as to which transactions to enter into. From the English translations of the transcripts for various telephone conversations, it can be seen that Pan was not a passive listener who simply accepted DB’s suggestions and advice, but was very much involved during the telephone discussions on which transactions to enter into.47Foot Note 47×Seeeg, 55AB 42825 (telephone conversation on 25 March 2008 at or around 2.18pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 21.He requested/directed DB to obtain certain specific information for him to make his investment decisions. For instance, one of Pan’s directions was for DB to produce an analysis report in English on three telecommunication companies, and to have the report translated into Chinese.48Foot Note 48×See 56AB 43344 (telephone conversation on 4 June 2008 at or around 4.27pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 56.Pan also said to hand him the original English version for him to “take a look” and that he would “find a telecommunications expert” with whom he would discuss the telecommunication companies. 26 As early as in May 2007 (at least from Pan’s communications with DB), Pan was familiar with the operations of the various financial products he considered purchasing, like accumulators, and he was able to have discussions with DB’s employees to assess whether to purchase them.49Foot Note 49×Seeeg, 55AB 42252–42257 (telephone conversation on 16 May 2007 at or around 12pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 37.I do not accept the Plaintiffs’ allegation that he did not understand the risks associated with accumulators and at [147] below, I elaborate on this point. At present, I mention briefly that even though the Plaintiffs suffered losses on accumulators, they continued to purchase accumulators even after 13 October 2008 when some positions of the Plaintiffs under the Accounts were closed out by DB, although they said that the value of these transactions was much less than those previously entered into.50Foot Note 50×See Plaintiffs’ Reply Closing Submissions at para 24.Pan also made decisions on the type, size and specification of the transactions he wanted to enter into.51Foot Note 51×Seeeg, 55AB 42974–42975 (telephone conversation on 2 April 2008 at or around 5.11pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 49(b); 56AB 43344–43345 (telephone conversation on 4 June 2008 at or around 4.27pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 56.These financial products were relatively complex in their operations (see [48]–[49] below for a description of accumulators). 27 Pan also had some investment practices which appeared not to have the objective of simply preserving his wealth and protecting it from depreciation. For instance, Pan was willing to trade more in a company’s stock even though its price was falling.52Foot Note 52×See 56AB 43344–43345 (telephone conversation on 4 June 2008 at or around 4.27pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 74.Pan was also unwilling to enter into a transaction where he could “earn money now, but [where he] would be cutting down [his] profits to 6% or so”, as he said to DB’s employees during a telephone conversation.53Foot Note 53×See 56AB 43354 (telephone conversation on 4 June 2008 at or around 4.27pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 75. 28 In the circumstances, although the Plaintiffs sought to show that Pan did act on the recommendation of DB at times, this did not detract from the fact that he had his own mind and that it was he who finally decided what transactions to enter into and the terms thereof. I also find that Pan’s investment objective was not to preserve his wealth and protect it from depreciation, but rather to grow his wealth by taking risks. Pan was an experienced investor who understood the financial products he purchased, and he chose to purchase numerous accumulators despite their complexity and risk of capital loss (see [49] below). He was aggressive in that he was prepared to take high risks for high returns. I reach these conclusions even without having to have regard to the CAPRs or the Questionnaire. 29 I also make some observations on Chang. 30 DB’s case was that Chang was the main gatekeeper for the Accounts,ie, the key person for the Plaintiffs with whom DB would often communicate on transactions to be entered into, like in relation to information on prices, and Chang would in turn update Pan accordingly.54Foot Note 54×See Yim’s affidavit dated 1 February 2018 (“Yim’s affidavit”) at para 20; Sze’s affidavit at para 22. 31 On the other hand, the Plaintiffs took the position that Chang’s role was initially only to safe-keep and apply one of two corporate seals of a company known as AOC International (presumably owned by Pan).55Foot Note 55×See Chang’s affidavit dated 3 February 2018 (“Chang’s affidavit”) at para 13.As a colleague of hers had a serious illness, Chang also joined the colleague and Pan in meetings and telephone discussions with banks.56Foot Note 56×See Chang’s affidavit at paras 13, 15.Chang’s role was to record the transactions which Pan entered into during the meetings and discussions. Gradually, she also started to arrange these meetings and discussions. However, Chang deposed in her AEIC that her main role was still to safe-keep and apply one of two corporate seals of AOC International.57Foot Note 57×See Chang’s affidavit at para 15.The Plaintiffs also appeared to take the position that Pan and Chang were not even aware that Chang was treated by DB as Pan’s gatekeeper.58Foot Note 58×See Notes of Evidence of 19 March 2018 (“NEs 19/03/18”) at p 69 lines 6–20.Chang deposed in her AEIC that she did not have any financial investment qualifications and knew little about financial investments,59Foot Note 59×See Chang’s affidavit at paras 9, 17, 40.and she disagreed during cross-examination that she would discuss the terms of proposed investments before they were put to Pan.60Foot Note 60×See Notes of Evidence of 13 March 2018 (“NEs 13/03/18”) at p 11 lines 5–10.Chang also deposed that she was not proficient in English and could not read, speak or understand English save for simple words.61Foot Note 61×See Chang’s affidavit at para 11. 32 I find that Chang was hardly ignorant about the transactions the Plaintiffs entered into under the Accounts, despite her evidence to the contrary. In a telephone conversation held on 2 June 2008 at or around 2.49pm between Chang, Juan and Kwok, it began with Juan informing Kwok that “[Chang] wants to talk to us about how she calculates the [foreign exchange]”.62Foot Note 62×56AB 43307.Chang then started talking about her calculations. I will set out the conversation later at [103] below. 33 When cross-examined on this telephone conversation, Chang denied that she was doing any calculations in relation to the Accounts on behalf of Pan, or that she wanted to check DB’s calculations.63Foot Note 63×See NEs 13/03/18 at p 23 lines 9–15, p 24 line 10.She instead testified that Pan did not know she was doing these calculations.64Foot Note 64×See NEs 13/03/18 at p 24 lines 2–3.During re-examination, Chang explained that she did these calculations for her own knowledge because she “would like to know in [her] mind”.65Foot Note 65×See Notes of Evidence of 14 March 2018 (“NEs 14/03/18”) at p 31 lines 2–7.I find her evidence in respect of this telephone conversation hard to believe. 34 There were numerous telephone conversations between Chang and DB’s employees, of which Pan was not a part.66Foot Note 66×Seeeg, 55AB 42950–42970 (telephone conversation on 2 April 2008 at or around 3.57pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 49(a).DB relied on Chang to convey information to Pan, and discussed proposed investments with her before they were put to Pan.67Foot Note 67×Seeeg, 55AB 42236–42245 (telephone conversations on 26 January 2007 at or around 10.21am, 11.37am, 12.02pm, 12.13pm). 35 I do not accept Pan’s evidence that Chang discussed proposed investments with DB without his knowledge and consent. Pan’s evidence in his AEIC and during cross-examination was that in April 2008, he scolded Chang for conveying DB’s advice on accumulators to him instead of telling DB to advise him directly, and told Juan to explain proposed investments to him directly and not by way of passing messages through Chang.68Foot Note 68×See Pan’s affidavit at para 93; Notes of Evidence of 1 March 2018 at p 67 lines 19–25, p 68 lines 1–19.However, in a telephone conversation held on 24 July 2008, Pan himself instructed DB, “Go and talk to [Chang] about [the transaction] and we will do this.”69Foot Note 69×See 57AB 44317 (telephone conversation on 24 July 2008 at or around 11.31am) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 139.The fact that Pan would have separate discussions with Chang as to which transactions to enter into was evidenced in a telephone conversation where Pan told Juan, “[Chang] has given me ample ‘brainwashing’.”70Foot Note 70×Seeeg, 55AB 42987 (telephone conversation on 2 April 2008 at or around 5.11pm) referred to in Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 139.In Chang’s telephone conversations with DB’s employees without Pan, Chang would also convey Pan’s responses in respect of the Accounts and the transactions thereunder. In fact, Chang would even tell DB’s employees how they should focus their conversations with Pan.71Foot Note 71×Seeeg, Chang’s affidavit at paras 137–139. 36 In the circumstances, I find that Chang was the main gatekeeper for the Accounts, where DB would often communicate information pertaining to the Accounts to her and discuss proposed investments with her, for her to update Pan. She was familiar with the transactions entered into under the Accounts, and Pan also relied on her as he made decisions under the Accounts. 37 The remaining facts set out will focus on key dates and/or events relevant to the dispute between the parties in relation to the four main heads of claim.",
        "Trip between 30 July 2008 and 1 August 2008": "38 From 30 July 2008 to 1 August 2008, DB hosted Pan, Chang and Chen on a three-day all-expenses-paid trip to Hong Kong.72Foot Note 72×SOC at para 37; Defence at para 42. 39 The Plaintiffs pleaded that on 30 July 2008, Juan told Pan when he was checking in at the hotel, that DB had helped the Plaintiffs earn a profit of US$50m.73Foot Note 73×SOC at para 50. 40 On 31 July 2008, DB had a meeting with Pan at the office of DB HK (“31 July 2008 Meeting”). The attendees at this meeting included Pan, Chang, Juan, Kwok and Yim. 41 The Plaintiffs pleaded that at the 31 July 2008 Meeting, Juan repeated to Pan that DB had helped the Plaintiffs earn a profit of US$50m.74Foot Note 74×SOC at para 51.The Plaintiffs submitted that there did not appear to be anyone else who heard Juan make this representation other than Pan and (perhaps) Kwok (who had sat beside Pan during the meeting).75Foot Note 75×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 298.Pan deposed in his AEIC that he “recall[ed] exclaiming loudly that this was the best piece of news that [he] had heard in a while”.76Foot Note 76×Pan’s affidavit at para 246.I will refer to the two times that Juan allegedly represented to Pan that the Plaintiffs had earned a profit of US$50m collectively as “the US$50m profit representation”. DB did not admit that the US$50m profit representation had been made to Pan.77Foot Note 77×Defence at para 57. 42 The Plaintiffs also pleaded that at the 31 July 2008 Meeting, DB told Pan that the Plaintiffs made a profit of US$19.26m in respect of foreign exchange transactions alone (“the US$19.26m FX profit representation”).78Foot Note 78×SOC at para 52.Specifically, the Plaintiffs alleged that it was Kwok who made the US$19.26m FX profit representation to Pan.79Foot Note 79×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 36(b).Pan deposed in his AEIC that he recalled Kwok telling him that “the Plaintiffs had also made approximately USD 20 million from foreign exchange transactions”.80Foot Note 80×Pan’s affidavit at para 247. 43 On the other hand, Yim deposed in his AEIC that Kwok showed Pan a slide presentation titled “FX & Commodities” and dated the same day (“31 July 2008 Slides”).81Foot Note 81×See Yim’s affidavit at paras 38–39; 52AB 40133–40144.The 31 July 2008 Slides were in the form of hardcopies handed to Pan and the others at the meeting.82Foot Note 82×See NEs 19/03/18 at p 120 lines 20–25, p 121 lines 1–25, p 140 lines 14–18.In the 31 July 2008 Slides, there was a slide titled “Zillion Global: FX P/L” showing a spreadsheet which summed several items of realised and unrealised profits and losses for foreign exchange transactions, and arrived at the grand total of US$19,264,844.49.83Foot Note 83×52AB 40139.DB admitted that it had informed Pan by way of the 31 July 2008 Slides that the Plaintiffs’ profit, including unrealised profits, in respect of foreign exchange transactions was US$19,264,844.49 as at 31 July 2008.84Foot Note 84×Defence at para 58. 44 At the 31 July 2008 Meeting, DB also recommended Pan to purchase various financial products, including “the Trumpet”.85Foot Note 85×SOC at para 53; Defence at para 60.Thereafter, the Plaintiffs entered into,inter alia, the following transactions on 31 July 2008 (“31 July 2008 Transactions”), which the Plaintiffs pleaded generated the following financial consequences subsequently:86Foot Note 86×See SOC at paras 55, 143; Defence at paras 65, 120; Reply at paras 42, 69. (a) the Trumpet: alleged loss of US$12,493,100; (b) Australian dollar (“AUD”)/US dollar (“USD”) accumulator (ie, to accumulate AUD at a certain strike price in USD87Foot Note 87×Notes of Evidence of 9 March 2018 (“NEs 09/03/18”) at p 142 lines 24–25, p 143 lines 1–3.): alleged loss of US$15.7m; (c) gold/USD accumulator: alleged loss of US$3.05m; (d) Credit Derivative Transactions (Citigroup Inc): profit of US$327,932.98 (agreed between the parties); and (e) Renewal Opportunity Notes (otherwise known as ‘renewable opportunity certificates with accrual notes’ (“ROCAs”)) linked to uranium companies Cameco Corporation and USEC Inc: alleged loss of US$646,500. 45 I will briefly provide some description of the financial products mentioned at [44(a)] to [44(c)] and [44(e)] above which allegedly resulted in losses for the Plaintiffs. 46 The Trumpet was five separate strangles which operated independently of each other,88Foot Note 88×See NEs 09/03/18 at p 151 lines 16–19; Notes of Evidence of 15 March 2018 (“NEs 15/03/18”) at p 48 lines 15–19, p 49 lines 2–5.and an investor would sell the Trumpet for an upfront combined premium of US$200,000.89Foot Note 89×See Exhibit D5 at p 3; NEs 15/03/18 at p 48 lines 20–21.Each of the five strangles was for a specified duration and was a combination of (i) a put option for AUD, with a lower “strike price” (in USD), and (ii) a call option for AUD, with a higher “strike price” (in USD).90Foot Note 90×See NEs 09/03/18 at p 153 lines 1–3; NEs 15/03/18 at p 47 lines 1–4.Whether or not the options would be exercised by the buyer of the Trumpet depended on how the spot price (prevailing market price) for AUD changed. If the spot price for AUD fell below the lower strike price, the buyer of the Trumpet could exercise the put option, and the investor would have to buy a certain amount of AUD from him at the lower strike price. If instead the spot price for AUD rose above the higher strike price, the buyer of the Trumpet could exercise the call option, and the investor would have to sell a certain amount of AUD to him at the higher strike price. The five strangles had different combinations of lower and higher strike prices and different specified durations.91Foot Note 91×See Exhibit D5 at pp 3–8; NEs 15/03/18 at p 49 lines 6–11. 47 Accordingly, the maximum profit the investor would receive from the Trumpet was the upfront combined premium of US$200,000.92Foot Note 92×See NEs 15/03/18 at p 43 lines 16–17, p 48 lines 21–22.The investor would enjoy this maximum profit when the spot price for AUD remained within each of the five strangles’ range of lower and higher strike prices.93Foot Note 93×See NEs 09/03/18 at p 152 lines 7–10; NEs 15/03/18 at p 48 lines 10–12; Campana’s affidavit dated 2 February 2018 (“Campana’s affidavit”) at p 1052 para 4.8.However, the investor’s profit would be reduced whenever the buyer of the Trumpet exercised a put option or a call option when the spot price for AUD moved outside of a strangle’s range of lower and higher strike prices,ie, when it either fell below the lower strike price, or rose above the higher strike price.94Foot Note 94×See Campana’s affidavit at p 1053 para 4.11.Should the spot price for AUD move far outside of a strangle’s range of lower and higher strike prices, the investor might see his upfront premium completely depleted and also suffer a loss.95Foot Note 95×See Campana’s affidavit at p 1053 para 4.12; NEs 15/03/18 at p 43 lines 18–21, p 48 lines 12–14, 23–25. 48 As for the accumulators, the type of accumulator in question was a structured product under which an investor committed to purchase and accumulate a varying quantity of a product at a pre-agreed “strike price” over a specified duration.96Foot Note 96×See Beloreshki’s affidavit dated 5 February 2018 (“Beloreshki’s affidavit”) at p 18 n 18; Campana’s affidavit at p 34 para 3.34, p 1040 para 2.8.The strike price would have been set at a discount to the product’s spot price at the time the accumulator was purchased. The investor would be obligated to continue purchasing and accumulating the product at the strike price, unless the product’s spot price reached a pre-agreed “knock-out price”. The accumulator would then be “knocked out” (terminated).97Foot Note 97×See NEs 15/03/18 at p 107 lines 7–11, p 108 lines 21–24.The knock-out price would have been set at a price higher than the product’s spot price at the time the accumulator was purchased. 49 Accordingly, accumulating the product would be profitable when its spot price remained higher than the strike price. However, accumulating the product would be loss-making when its spot price became lower than the strike price. The investor would be obligated under the terms of the accumulator to continue purchasing the product at the strike price, and could additionally be required to accumulate alargerquantity of the product as well (at the strike price) at a pre-agreed “gearing ratio”.98Foot Note 98×See Campana’s affidavit at p 34 para 3.35, p 36 para 3.41; Tsang’s affidavit dated 1 February 2018 (“Tsang’s affidavit”) at paras 26, 43.The gearing ratio was the multiplier used to determine the quantity of the product the investor would be required to purchase. At the time of purchase of the accumulator, the strike price could be negotiated lower in exchange for a higher gearing ratio. The investor bore the risk of capital loss contingent on a decline in the product’s spot price.99Foot Note 99×See Beloreshki’s affidavit at p 18 n 18; Campana’s affidavit at p 1040 para 2.8.(For a description of accumulators, seeDeutsche Bank AG v ChangTse Wen and another appeal[2013] 4 SLR 886 (“ChangTse Wen”) at [11];TeoWai Cheong v Crédit Industriel et Commercial and another appeal[2013] 3 SLR 573 at [4]). 50 As for the ROCAs, a ROCA was a structured product which was an equity-linked note with a payoff dependent on the equity’s performance over a specified duration, and an investor’s principal (that was used to purchase the ROCA) was not guaranteed.100Foot Note 100×See Campana’s affidavit at p 33 para 3.29; NEs 15/03/18 at p 121 line 24.The ROCA was thus unlike a typical bond where an investor expected to receive his principal back.101Foot Note 101×See NEs 15/03/18 at p 121 line 25, p 122 line 1.When the equity traded within a specified range, the ROCA earned a fixed interest that was above the market return.102Foot Note 102×See Campana’s affidavit at p 33 para 3.29, p 34 para 3.30; NEs 15/03/18 at p 121 lines 9–10; Beloreshki’s affidavit at p 19 n 19.However, when the equity traded outside this range, the ROCA did not earn any interest. Additionally, the ROCA might have a mandatory early redemption period such that if the equity traded at a specified price level before maturity, the ROCA must be redeemed for a pre-specified amount.103Foot Note 103×See Campana’s affidavit at p 34 para 3.30; NEs 15/03/18 at p 121 lines 19–22.At maturity, the investor might also be required to take physical delivery of the equity, which meant that he might lose his principal if the price of the equity dropped.104Foot Note 104×See Campana’s affidavit at p 34 para 3.32; NEs 15/03/18 at p 122 lines 2–4.Therefore, the investor bore the risk of capital loss contingent on a decline in the equity’s price.105Foot Note 105×See Beloreshki’s affidavit at p 19 n 19. 51 It was the Plaintiffs’ case that the US$50m profit representation and the US$19.26m FX profit representation were misrepresentations and that Pan relied solely on these representations when the Plaintiffs entered into the 31 July 2008 Transactions.",
        "August 2008": "52 In August 2008, collateral shortfall problems started materialising in the Accounts.106Foot Note 106×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 38; Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 63, 123.",
        "18 September 2008 Meeting (and the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter)": "53 On 18 September 2008, DB had a meeting with Pan at the office of DB HK (“18 September 2008 Meeting”). DB pleaded that during this meeting, its employees informed Pan that DB had written a margin call letter addressed to Zillion and dated 17 September 2008 (“17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter”), and proceeded to discuss the letter’s contents with Pan.107Foot Note 107×Defence at para 81; 6AB 4128–4142. 54 The 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter was in relation to Zillion’s advisory account. It stated that there was a current shortfall of US$41,505,215.56 between the collateral value and the total exposure, and accordingly, DB requested that Zillion take immediate steps to restore the shortfall by 19 September 2008, by either providing additional security or reducing the total exposure. DB added that during the interim period when the shortfall was outstanding, it reserved its rights under the contracts, including the right to liquidate any part or the whole of the collateral without prior notice and the right to terminate the facility. 55 However, the Plaintiffs pleaded that DB neither sent the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter nor communicated its contents to them at the material time.108Foot Note 108×See SOC at para 75.The Plaintiffs claimed that a copy of this letter was only provided by DB’s solicitors to the Plaintiffs’ solicitors after 13 October 2008.109Foot Note 109×See SOC at para 75.",
        "3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter": "56 I proceed to discuss the events on the night of 3 October 2008. At or around 9.56pm, Juan sent an e-mail to Chang with the subject title “Fw: [Issued Margin Call Letter] / Zillion Global Group [with Zillion’s advisory account number]” (“3 October 2008 E-mail”), and copied DB’s employees, including Yim and Sze, on the e-mail.110Foot Note 110×3AB 1868–1870; see also SOC at para 93.As for the contents of this e-mail, Juan had simply forwarded an internal DB e-mail and its attachment. The internal DB e-mail was originally sent on 3 October 2008 at or around 9.23pm by one Ms Samantha Leung from DB’s Credit Risk Management to Juan, and the other recipients included Tsang, Yim and Sze (the latter two were copied on the e-mail). 57 The internal DB e-mail stated: … In view of aggregate shortfall in excess of USD 19mio [sic], with the decision from senior management, Margin Call Letter (see attached) is now issued to the subject client. … … Appreciate your continued effort in rectifying the position and let us know the rectification by Monday 06 Oct 08.… … [emphasis in original] 58 The attachment was a margin call letter DB had written, addressed to Zillion and dated 3 October 2008 (“3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter”). It was in relation to Zillion’s advisory account. The 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter stated that there was a current shortfall of US$8,950,765.73 between the collateral value and the total exposure, and accordingly, DB requested that Zillion take immediate steps to restore the shortfall by 6 October 2008, by either providing additional security or reducing the total exposure. As with the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter (see [54] above), DB added that during the interim period when the shortfall was outstanding, it reserved its rights under the contracts, including the right to liquidate any part or the whole of the collateral without prior notice and the right to terminate the facility. This letter was signed by Chiu and Samantha Leung. 59 At around the time Juan sent the 3 October 2008 E-mail to Chang, Juan also met Chang at Pan’s office in Taipei. This “3 October 2008 Meeting” was held at around 10pm. DB pleaded that when Juan met Chang, Juan discussed the contents of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter with Chang.111Foot Note 111×See Defence at para 93(e).On the other hand, Chang deposed in her AEIC that while Juan mentioned that she had e-mailed a document to Chang, Juan did not tell Chang that the document was a margin call letter.112Foot Note 112×See Chang’s affidavit at paras 403–404. 60 The Plaintiffs pleaded that Chang did not check the 3 October 2008 E-mail that day, which was a Friday.113Foot Note 113×See SOC at para 93.On 4 October 2008, there were telephone conversations between Chang and DB’s employees. The Plaintiffs pleaded that it was the following day, on or about 5 October 2008, that Chang opened the 3 October 2008 E-mail.114Foot Note 114×See SOC at para 96.They averred that Chang could not understand the contents of the e-mail because it was in English (which she could not read save for simple words), and that when she called Juan to ask what the e-mail was about, Juan said that she did not know as she herself had not read the e-mail.115Foot Note 115×See SOC at para 96; Chang’s affidavit at para 11. 61 It was part of the Plaintiffs’ case that sending the 3 October 2008 E-mail with the enclosed 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter to Chang did not mean that DB had sent the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter to the Plaintiffs/Zillion because the e-mail and the letter should have been sent to Pan instead. As with the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter (see [55] above), the Plaintiffs averred that DB neither sent the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter nor communicated its contents to them at the material time.116Foot Note 116×See SOC at para 98.",
        "6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter": "62 On 6 October 2008, DB had a meeting with Pan at the office of DB HK (“6 October 2008 Meeting”).

Unlike the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter and the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter (see [54] and [58] above respectively), DB did not add that during the interim period when the shortfall was outstanding, it reserved its rights under the contracts, including the right to liquidate any part or the whole of the collateral without prior notice and the right to terminate the facility. However, the Plaintiffs did not raise any issue with regard to the differences between the contents of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter and those of the earlier two letters. 65 The Plaintiffs did allege that DB neither gave a copy of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter nor communicated its contents to Pan until after 13 October 2008.120Foot Note 120×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 153.The Plaintiffs alleged that there was no mention of such a letter during the 6 October 2008 Meeting.121Foot Note 121×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 153.",
        "8 October 2008 to 12 October 2008": "66 Thereafter, from 8 October 2008 to 12 October 2008, there were, amongst other things, telephone conversations involving Chang and DB’s employees.",
        "13 October 2008 Transactions": "67 On 13 October 2008 at or around 1.59pm, there was a telephone conversation primarily between Pan and Sze.122Foot Note 122×See SOC at para 105; Defence at para 99; Pan’s affidavit at para 373.It was DB’s case that during this telephone conversation, Pan authorised DB to close out all positions required in order to reduce the shortfall in the Accounts.123Foot Note 123×See Defence at para 99(c).It was the Plaintiffs’ case that no such authorisation was given. 68 Later that afternoon, DB closed out certain positions under the Accounts (“13 October 2008 Transactions”), and these included selling five gold call options, one AUD call option, three AUD forwards and A$80m, and unwinding a gold option.124Foot Note 124×See SOC at para 112; Defence at para 103. 69 At about 7.28pm, Chang called Juan and Juan informed her that DB had closed out certain positions under the Accounts.125Foot Note 125×See SOC at para 108; Defence at para 100; Chang’s affidavit at para 452.Pan deposed in his AEIC that Chang thereafter informed him of the same.126Foot Note 126×See Pan’s affidavit at paras 384–385.",
        "Parties’ cases": "70 The Plaintiffs had four main heads of claim against DB, namely that: (a) DB breached an implied term of the contracts with the Plaintiffs which obliged DB to provide regular updates on the state of the Accounts and the transactions thereunder; (b) DB breached a tortious duty of care it owed to the Plaintiffs to take reasonable care and skill; (c) DB was liable to the Plaintiffs for misrepresentation under s 2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act (Cap 390, 1994 Rev Ed) and for negligent misrepresentation when DB made the US$50m profit representation and the US$19.26m FX profit representation; and (d) DB breached the contracts with the Plaintiffs by unilaterally closing out certain positions under the Accounts through the 13 October 2008 Transactions. 71 In so far as DB relied on contract terms in its defence, the Plaintiffs relied on ss 2 and 3 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act (Cap 396, 1994 Rev Ed) (“UCTA”) and pleaded that any contract term that sought to, amongst other things, exclude or restrict DB’s liability for breach of contract or for negligence was unenforceable because it did not satisfy the requirement of reasonableness.127Foot Note 127×See Reply at paras 22A, 22B. 72 As mentioned at [4] above, DB also pleaded that the Plaintiffs’ actions founded on contract and on tort in respect of and/or relating to any matter in the Accounts that had arisen prior to 3 July 2008 had accrued more than six years before the time the Plaintiffs filed the writ of summons on 3 July 2014, and were barred by virtue of s 6(1)(a) of the Limitation Act.128Foot Note 128×Defence at para 117A. 73 I will address the Plaintiffs’ four main heads of claimseriatim. In so doing, I will generally analyse these claims on the premise that there was no contract term which excluded or restricted DB’s liability. I will then proceed to consider, where necessary, whether there was any contract term that sought to exclude or restrict DB’s liability and whether such a term was enforceable. I will thereafter also consider, where necessary, the issue of a time bar.",
        "Issue of breach of an implied term": "74 I proceed to consider the Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of an implied term.",
        "Summary of the parties’ positions": "224 The Plaintiffs submitted that Pan did not authorise DB to close out positions under the Accounts on 13 October 2008 (see [67] above).292Foot Note 292×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 108.The Plaintiffs pleaded that DB had instead unilaterally closed out certain positions under the Accounts in breach of contract.293Foot Note 293×See SOC at para 122.The Plaintiffs pleaded that DB had breached cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement (set out again at [238] below) by not giving them the requisite one business day’s notice before closing out the positions through the 13 October 2008 Transactions.294Foot Note 294×See SOC at para 121(b).The Plaintiffs thus claimed all loss suffered as a result of this alleged breach.295Foot Note 295×SOC at para 122. 225 On the other hand, DB denied that it had closed out the positions under the Accounts in breach of contract.296Foot Note 296×Defence at para 112.DB averred that the Accounts had been in shortfall and/or had insufficient collateral,297Foot Note 297×See Defence at para 99(a).and on 13 October 2008, in view of the continuing shortfall, Pan expressly authorised DB to close out all positions required in order to reduce the shortfall.298Foot Note 298×Defence at para 99(c). 226 Further or in the alternative, DB submitted that it had not breached cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement because it had provided proper notice of the collateral shortfall in the Accounts,299Foot Note 299×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 121.and it was therefore entitled to close out certain positions even if Pan had not expressly authorised the close-out. 227 Further or in the alternative, DB relied on various contract terms and pleaded that it was in any event entitled to terminate and/or close out the outstanding transactions in the Accounts as the margin cover and/or the collateral value was inadequate, and/or the close-out ratios were reached.300Foot Note 300×See Defence at para 99(e); Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 157. 228 I mention that the Plaintiffs had also pleaded that DB had breached cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement by closing out positions under the Accounts when the Accounts were not in shortfall and/or had sufficient collateral.301Foot Note 301×See SOC at para 121(a).In this regard, the Plaintiffs had pleaded that DB had failed to give any value to their BOE Technology Group Co Ltd shares, Creed Corporation shares, 400,000 Allianz preferred shares and 200,000 ING preferred shares. However, in their closing submissions, the Plaintiffs did not pursue these points. After DB submitted in its closing submissions at para 127 that the Plaintiffs appeared to have abandoned their position that the Accounts were not in shortfall on 13 October 2008, the Plaintiffs also did not reply to this point in their reply submissions. I will thus proceed on the premise that the Plaintiffs have accepted that the Accounts were in fact in shortfall and/or had insufficient collateral on 13 October 2008.",
        "Decision": "Whether Pan authorised the closing out of positions on 13 October 2008 229 I first consider whether Pan authorised DB to close out positions under the Accounts on 13 October 2008. 230 The parties essentially disputed as to whether Pan had given such authorisation in a telephone conversation on 13 October 2008 at or around 1.59pm involving Pan and Sze (see [67] above). The duration of the conversation was just over three minutes, and the conversation was conducted in Mandarin and Cantonese, interspersed with some English words. I set out at length the relevant portions of the English translation of the transcript for this conversation, and I have underlined the words which were spoken in English during the conversation:302Foot Note 302×59AB 45770–45774. … [Sze]: Er, Mr Pan, good afternoon, how are you? … [Pan]: ---I don’t wish you guys to give us any moremargin call.

Everyday keep dragging---dragging on, until the head aches. … [Pan]: … Everyday telling me, telephoning me to say you havemargin callnow. … [Sze]: There is something else, Mr Pan, because I---I don’t know ifMelanie[Juan] has given you a figure because up till last Friday we---because the market is still dropping, so now it’s only about 70 million plus. … [Sze]: Okay, we will calculate it again and at the same time,we will determine what we will close out now, that is, which position to close out. [Pan]: Correct. … [Sze]: Okay, (I) know. We will---we will get in touch with you by phone in about two hours’ time, okay? [Pan]: Okay. … … [emphasis added] 231 In relation to the line by Sze, “we willdeterminewhat we will close out now” [emphasis added], Sze testified that the word “determine” was translated from the Chinese equivalent for “confirm” (ie, “que ding”, and not “jueding”).303Foot Note 303×NEs 22/03/18 at p 109 lines 20–25, p 110 lines 1–2. 232 The Plaintiffs submitted that during the telephone conversation, Pan had asked Sze to consider which positions Pan had to close out and get back to Pan for a final decision.304Foot Note 304×Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 112.The Plaintiffs submitted that Pan did not authorise Sze to close out any positions in the Plaintiffs’ portfolio. On the other hand, DB contended that Pan had expressly authorised DB to close out positions on 13 October 2008.305Foot Note 305×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 115. 233 I find that during the telephone conversation, Pan did not authorise DB to close out the positions on 13 October 2008,ie, enter into the 13 October 2008 Transactions. I agree with the Plaintiffs’ submission that Pan had asked Sze to get back to Pan for a final decision as to which positions to close out. Pan said as much when he said at the beginning of this conversation, “You guys think how (you) want to come out,wecome and make a final decision” [emphasis added]. Pan’s later statement, “You guys as ateamcome and take charge of it”, should be understood bearing in mind his first statement. 234 I find that Sze’s references to his team discussing the matter, determining or confirming which positions to close out and getting back to Pan in about two hours’ time suggested that Sze was going to get back to Pan with the team’s view and discuss with Pan so that Pan would at least have his say before DB made a final decision as to which outstanding positions to close out. 235 I also do not find that the other arguments of DB assist DB much. DB submitted that Pan testified that he would have allowed DB to close out the positions under the Accounts if he had understood that there was a margin call.306Foot Note 306×Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 119.In respect of this submission, even if Pan in fact knew that there was a margin call and even if he would have allowed DB to close out some positions, this did not mean that he did in fact authorise any closing out on 13 October 2008. 236 DB also argued that Pan’s conduct in continuing to trade under the Accounts after the Plaintiffs were informed about the close-out on 13 October 2008 was entirely inconsistent with the conduct of a customer who claimed that he had been aggrieved by a bank which had acted without his authority.307Foot Note 307×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 120.I do not place much weight on this submission. There was evidence from Pan that he had complained to Raju on 14 November 2008 that he had not authorised the close-out on 13 October 2008,308Foot Note 308×See Pan’s affidavit at paras 392–393.and Raju did respond to his complaint by a letter dated 1 December 2008, although this was to state DB’s position.309Foot Note 309×See 6AB 4203–4207.So Pan’s conduct in continuing to trade under the Accounts did not necessarily mean that he was wrong about the absence of express authorisation from him. Whether DB breached cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement 237 I proceed to consider whether DB gave the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement before closing out the positions under the Accounts through the 13 October 2008 Transactions. 238 I reproduce the relevant portion of cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement (which was earlier set out at [97] above):310Foot Note 310×7AB 4606–4607. 2.6 … Such margin or collateral requirements may be notified by the Bank to the Counterpartyin writing or verbally. If the Bank shall for any reason deem that there is insufficient collateral held …the Counterparty shall within one businessday’s notice thereof deliver additional collateral of a type acceptable to the Bankin its sole discretion … in an amount as may be required by the Bank. … For the avoidance of doubt,if the Counterparty fails to deliver such additional collateral, such failure shall constitute an Event of Defaultin respect of the Counterparty pursuant to Clause 5 below andthe Bank may proceed to terminate some or all of the Transactions at its discretion pursuant to Clause 5 without further notice to the Counterpartyother than the notice of termination to be provided under Clause 5.4. [emphasis added] 239 The requisite notice under cl 2.6 was one business day for the Plaintiffs to deliver additional collateral to DB, and this notice to deliver additional collateral was otherwise known as a “margin call”. The parties did not seem to dispute that DB could make a margin call “in writing or verbally”.311Foot Note 311×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 135; Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 127. 240 As to whether DB gave the requisite notice under cl 2.6, there were essentially three margin call letters and the related events surrounding these letters to consider. The three margin call letters were: a 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter, a 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter and a 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter. Although there were some differences in content between the first two letters and the third letter, the Plaintiffs did not dispute that all three letters were in the nature of margin calls (unlike inLam Chi Kin David v Deutsche Bank AG[2011] 1 SLR 800 (“Lam Chi Kin David”) at [19]–[20]). This was so even though one of their experts, Walford, drew a distinction in his report between a margin call and a situation where a bank informs a client of a collateral shortfall without specifying the value of the additional collateral to deliver and the time period within which the client must deliver the additional collateral.312Foot Note 312×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at paras 126–127; Walford’s affidavit dated 31 January 2018 at p 55 paras 9.126–9.127.I will consider the three letters in turn. 241 I mention one other point first, having set out cl 2.6. I note that the parties did not plead or submit on the “notice of termination to be provided under Clause 5.4”, referred to at the end of cl 2.6. Since there was no pleading or submission about it, I will proceed on the basis that it was not in issue between the parties. (1) 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter 242 There was some dispute between the parties as to whether DB communicated the contents of the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter to the Plaintiffs during the 18 September 2008 Meeting (see [53] and [55] above). 243 However, I find that, in any event, the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter and/or any communication of its contents would not constitute the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement. There did not seem to be a dispute between the parties that any collateral shortfall which was the subject of the 17 September 2008 Margin Call Letter was rectified a few days later.313Foot Note 313×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 134.Yim and Sze had agreed in cross-examination that the collateral shortfall was rectified a few days later (like as at 25 September 2008).314Foot Note 314×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 133; NEs 20/03/18 at p 68 lines 5–9; NEs 22/03/18 at p 67 lines 24–25, p 68. (2) 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter 244 The 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter was contained in the attachment of the 3 October 2008 E-mail which Juan sent Chang on 3 October 2008 at or around 9.56pm (see [56] and [58] above). DB also pleaded that at the 3 October 2008 Meeting when Juan met Chang at Pan’s office in Taipei, Juan discussed the contents of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter with Chang (see [59] above). 245 As mentioned at [58] above, the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter stated that there was a current shortfall of US$8,950,765.73 between the collateral value and the total exposure, and accordingly, DB requested that Zillion take immediate steps to restore the shortfall by 6 October 2008, by either providing additional security or reducing the total exposure. DB added that during the interim period when the shortfall was outstanding, it reserved its rights under the contracts, including the right to liquidate any part or the whole of the collateral without prior notice and the right to terminate the facility. 246 As regards the pleadings in relation to the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, the Plaintiffs pleaded in their statement of claim that DB neither sent the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter nor communicated its contents to the Plaintiffs themselves on 3 October 2008 or at all.315Foot Note 315×See SOC at para 98.DB pleaded in its defence that the Plaintiffs were aware of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter as DB’s representatives had communicated its contents to Chang in person at the 3 October 2008 Meeting as well as over the telephone on 3 October 2008.316Foot Note 316×See Defence at paras 93, 93(e).To this pleading, the Plaintiffs in its reply only joined issue with DB, without any elaboration.317Foot Note 317×See Reply at para 56. 247 It was in Chang’s AEIC that she deposed that she had “no authority” under the Accounts and that Juan should have sent the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter directly to Pan.318Foot Note 318×See Chang’s affidavit at para 406.It was in Pan’s AEIC that he deposed that DB only gave him a copy of this letter after 13 October 2008.319Foot Note 319×See Pan’s affidavit at para 351. 248 As regards the parties’ closing submissions, DB submitted that it was proper for it to inform the Plaintiffs of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter by sending a copy of it to Chang instead of to Pan.320Foot Note 320×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 143.DB argued that Pan had intimated by his conduct that Chang was authorised to discuss all matters relating to the Accounts with DB,321Foot Note 321×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 141.although Chang was not authorised to make any decision as to which transaction to enter into. DB cited the High Court case ofGoldrichVenture Pte Ltd and another v Halcyon Offshore Pte Ltd[2015] 3 SLR 990 at [55] for a proposition about ostensible authority (also known as apparent authority) arising where there has been a representation by the conduct of a principal. DB submitted that Pan had never raised any issues or restrictions on the matters/information that Chang could discuss with or obtain from DB.322Foot Note 322×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 139.DB contended that Chang also did not previously take the position that she had no authority to communicate with DB on the collateral or margin position of the Accounts.323Foot Note 323×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at para 138(c)(iv). 249 On the other hand, the Plaintiffs submitted that sending a copy of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter to Chang did not mean that it was sent to the Plaintiffs because DB needed specific authorisation from Pan before it could send such account-related information to Chang, and there was no such authorisation.324Foot Note 324×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at paras 142–144.Based on the contractual documents, Chang was not named as an authorised signatory of any of the Accounts.325Foot Note 325×See 7AB 4486, 4510, 4598, 4616.The authorised signatory was either Pan (singly) or his two sons (jointly).326Foot Note 326×See also Pan’s affidavit at paras 63, 123. 250 As a preliminary point, I do not place much weight on Exhibit P6 which is the English translation of a letter from Pan addressed to DB dated 28 April 2009, which had been typewritten in Chinese requesting DB to send account-related information to Chang.327Foot Note 327×See also 6AB 4345.The Plaintiffs raised this letter as an example of how DB required such specific authorisation from Pan before it could send account-related information to Chang.328Foot Note 328×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 144.Whether or not it was DB that required this letter before sending such information to Chang, this letter was sent some months after the close-out on 13 October 2008. The letter is thus equivocal as to whether DB could send account-related information to Chang before 13 October 2008, because the letter could instead show that the parties were being more careful as to how account-related information was being conveyed after 13 October 2008. 251 On the concept of ostensible authority, the Court of Appeal inTribune Investment TrustInc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd[2000] 2 SLR(R) 407 at [48] cited with approval Lord Keith of Kinkel’s explanation inArmagasLtd v Mundogas SA (The “Ocean Frost”)[1986] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109 at 112 as follows: … Ostensible authority comes about where the principal, by words orconduct, hasrepresentedthat the agent has the requisite actual authority, and the party dealing with the agent has entered into a contract with himin reliance on that representation. The principle in these circumstances isestoppelfrom denying that actual authority existed. In the commonly encountered case, the ostensible authority is general in character, arising when the principal hasplaced the agent ina position which in the outside worldis generally regarded as carrying authority to enter into transactions of the kind in question. Ostensible general authority may also arise where the agent has hada course of dealing with a particular contractor and the principal has acquiescedin this course of dealing and honoured transactions arising out of it. … [emphasis added] The Court of Appeal inGuy Neale and others v Ku De Ta SG Pte Ltd[2015] 4 SLR 283 (“Guy Neale”) stated that the question of apparent authority is a question of mixed fact and law, and it is thus important to “analyse the facts to ascertain what exactly the alleged representation is” (at [98]). 252 I note also that the Court of Appeal inGuy Nealeanalysed the doctrine of ostensible authority as an instance of estoppel (at [95]–[97]). In the subsequent case ofThe “Bunga Melati 5”[2016] 2 SLR 1114, the Court of Appeal noted its decision inGuy Neale, and did not think it necessary on the facts of the case before it to decide whether there is a real difference between the doctrines of ostensible authority and of agency by estoppel (at [12]). Neither is it necessary for me to consider whether there is any such difference on the facts in the present case. 253 Yim gave evidence as to how DB was to issue a margin call to Pan. I set out Yim’s evidence during cross-examination:329Foot Note 329×NEs 20/03/18 at p 71 lines 8–25, p 72 lines 1–21. Q. Were you the one who instructed Ms Juan to send the letter via email? A. No. The -- the instruction was for the RM [Relationship Manager]to send the margin call letters to the clients. Q.So it wasn’t your instruction as well for Ms Juan toactually send the margin call letter to Grace Chang? A.Not that I was aware of. Q. So that was a decision which Ms Melanie Juan made herself? A. I don’t know. Q. Would you agree with me, and I think you probably would given your evidence earlier, that the 3 October margin call letter should have been sent to Mr Pan? A.I would agree that that would have followed up to send to Mr Pan, but I think margin calls are verbal as well as letter. But, yes, if you ask me in hindsight would I have copied -- would we better copy everyone else, the answer is yes. Q. You referred to verbal communications. A. Yes. Q. I’m going to suggest to you that even if Deutsche Bank wanted to make a verbal margin call, that should have been done to Mr Pan directly. Would you agree with me? A.I would agree with you that Mr Pan needed to know that was his case. Q. Yes,because he’s the authorised person under the plaintiffs’ account, right, Mr Yim? A.Yes, he is. Q.Ms Grace Chang, I think we have gone through this yesterday,does not have any authority under the accounts, right, Mr Yim? A.That is the understanding you have shown me. Q.I don’t believe that Mr Pan had given the bank any express authorisation to send the 3 October 2008 margin call letter to Ms Chang, right, Mr Yim? A.That is correctalthough Grace has been -- was involved all the way, but you are right from that perspective there was --not that I know of from an explicit written letter. [emphasis added] Yim testified that Pan was the authorised person named under the Accounts and Yim did not dispute that, as such, Chang did not have any authority under the Accounts. However, this did not answer the question as to whether or not Chang hadostensibleauthority to receive a margin call from DB on behalf of the Plaintiffs. 254 In this case, as mentioned at [36] above, Chang was the main gatekeeper for the Accounts. There was frequent communication in the past between Chang and DB on various matters pertaining to the Accounts including the discussion of the collateral position of the Accounts. Chang agreed during cross-examination that she would convey to Pan what DB told her about insufficient collateral from August 2008 to October 2008.330Foot Note 330×See NEs 13/03/18 at p 48 lines 10–15.In this regard, Pan was aware that DB was conveying information about insufficient collateral to Chang, and that Chang was in turn conveying such information to him. In Pan’s AEIC at para 354, he said that he did not recall Juan informing him of any collateral shortfall (on 3 October 2008). Instead, he heard about the shortfall from Chang. Significantly, at that time, he did not protest to DB to say that such information should have been given to him directly instead of to Chang. 255 In the circumstances, I find that Pan represented, at least by his conduct, that Chang had the requisite authority to receive a margin call from DB on behalf of the Plaintiffs, and that DB relied upon this representation in sending her a copy of the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter. This representation was made by Pan acquiescing, and not objecting, to the course of dealing where DB had discussions with Chang on virtually all matters pertaining to the Accounts, including on the collateral position of the Accounts. I thus find that Chang had ostensible authority to receive a margin call from DB. In the light of this, I find that the Plaintiffs were estopped from asserting that Chang was not authorised to receive a margin call from DB. 256 Where the 3 October 2008 E-mail and its attachment,ie, the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, were sent to Chang, I find that DB had given the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement. This is in spite of the Plaintiffs’ submission that Chang could not understand the contents of the e-mail and the letter because they were in English.331Foot Note 331×See SOC at para 96; Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 149.Most, if not all, of the written communication from DB’s employees to Chang were in English.332Foot Note 332×See NEs 14/03/18 at p 45 lines 4–25. 257 Chang said that she did not open the 3 October 2008 E-mail until 5 October 2008. She also said that she did not understand the contents of the e-mail and its attachment and that when she asked Juan about them, Juan said that she herself did not know their contents because she had not read the e-mail. Chang said that Juan told her the e-mail was not important since they were going to meet the next day,ie, on 6 October 2008.333Foot Note 333×See Chang’s affidavit at para 404. 258 I do not accept that Chang only opened the 3 October 2008 E-mail on 5 October 2008, even though 3 October 2008 was a Friday and the e-mail was sent late that night. This was a tense time for financial institutions and investors. Chang said that Juan had informed her that she (Juan) had e-mailed her a document when they met that night,ie, the 3 October 2008 Meeting. Chang would have opened the e-mail by the next day,ie, 4 October 2008. 259 During cross-examination, Tsang raised two telephone conversations that took place on 4 October 2008 between him, Juan and Chang at or around 11.04pm and 11.37pm respectively,334Foot Note 334×See 59AB 45593–45621; 59AB 45622–45632.to show that they were discussing how to tell Pan at the 6 October 2008 Meeting about the issue of a margin call.335Foot Note 335×See NEs 21/03/18 at pp 128–140; Tsang’s affidavit at para 84.Of note is what Juan said during the telephone conversation at or around 11.37pm, as recorded in the English translation of the relevant transcript (the words which were spoken in English are underlined):336Foot Note 336×59AB 45628–45629. [Juan]: …Grace, I---I feel that I will still tell him, that is, ‘Mr Pan,’ I still want to tell him about ‘the pressure of thismargin call,’ and also ‘your---yourliabilitiesare like this.’ I feel that I will definitely---I will definitely mention (it) … 260 Furthermore, whether Chang had opened the 3 October 2008 E-mail and its attachment on 4 October 2008 or on 5 October 2008, I do not accept that Juan told Chang that Juan herself did not know the contents of the attachment because she had not read the e-mail. Juan must have known the contents and their importance. She had been told to make a margin call (see [57] above) and she took the trouble to send the e-mail and its attachment at a late hour on 3 October 2008. 261 In my view, Chang had understood the contents of the e-mail and its attachment either from Juan or one of Chang’s own colleagues or she could read enough English to understand them. She was preparing for Pan’s meeting with DB on 6 October 2008, as evidenced by the telephone conversations on 4 October 2008, so that even if she learnt of the e-mail and its attachment only on 5 October 2008, she would have ensured that she understood their contents by 6 October 2008. 262 I note also that Chang deposed in her AEIC that she told Juan during the telephone conversation on 4 October 2008 at or around 11.04pm that Juan should be discussing the margin issues with Pan directly.337Foot Note 337×See Chang’s affidavit at para 418.In my view, Chang was uncomfortable in relaying the margin call from DB to Pan directly, but this did not mean that she did not have ostensible authority to receive the margin call from DB on behalf of the Plaintiffs. As mentioned, where the 3 October 2008 E-mail and its attachment,ie, the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, were sent to Chang, DB had given the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement (see [256] above), regardless of whether Chang subsequently relayed the margin call to Pan. In any case, where Chang informed Pan of the collateral shortfall in the Accounts on 3 October 2008 prior to the 6 October 2008 Meeting (see [254] above), I am of the view that she would have also relayed the margin call from DB to Pan, and that she would not have confined her discussion with Pan to just merely informing him about a collateral shortfall. (3) 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter 263 I proceed to consider the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter. DB pleaded that during the 6 October 2008 Meeting, it had issued to the Plaintiffs that letter. DB’s case was that the letter was handed to Pan at the 6 October 2008 Meeting, and that it had also informed Pan of the shortfall in the Accounts (see [63] above). On the other hand, the Plaintiffs submitted that DB neither gave a copy of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter nor communicated its contents to Pan until after 13 October 2008 (see [65] above). The Plaintiffs submitted that there was no mention of such a letter during the 6 October 2008 Meeting. 264 In this regard, the parties sought to adduce evidence, including circumstantial evidence, to prove that Pan was or was not handed the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, and relatedly whether he was or was not aware of this margin call. 265 As mentioned, the attendees at the 6 October 2008 Meeting included Pan, Chang and Chen, and, from DB, Juan, Tsang, Yim, Sze and Chiu (see [62] above). 266 I first consider the evidence from the employees of DB who were present at the 6 October 2008 Meeting. Juan was not a witness in these proceedings. Tsang did not give any evidence as to whether a copy of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter was provided to Pan.338Foot Note 338×Tsang’s affidavit at para 86.Yim deposed in his AEIC that the collateral shortfall in the Accounts was communicated to Pan although Yim could not specifically recall if a copy of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter was provided to Pan.339Foot Note 339×Yim’s affidavit at para 66. 267 Sze was the only employee of DB who gave more detailed evidence in relation to the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter. I set out Sze’s evidence during cross-examination:340Foot Note 340×NEs 22/03/18 at p 85 line 25, p 86 lines 1–19, p 87 lines 24–25, p 88 lines 1–8. A. … But the point was, before going into the door -- okay, glass door of that meeting, I told Ms Juan, ‘We need to -- you need to present physically the letter to Mr Pan.’ Because in the meeting,Dennis [Chiu] was there. He --hecame from credit risk management department.In this meeting,he was the policeman to make sure that we do that.So I have this very clear memory. Q. Your evidence is you told Ms Juan before you entered the glass door to give that letter? A. To remind her. … Q. But did you see her physically give the letter to Mr Pan during the meeting? A. I do not recall. But it should happen like that. Q. Mr Sze, I'm just asking – it’s either you do not recall or it happened. So is it you do not recall or did you really see Ms Juan give that letter to Mr Pan? A. I do not recall it happened. … Q. So do you want to change your evidence at paragraph 52 [of your AEIC] when you say ‘at the meeting, Melanie [Juan] provided Mr Pan with the 6 October 2008 margin call letter’? A. I would say I would change -- I believe Melanie provided. Q. So it’s: ‘I believe Melanie provided Mr Pan with the 6 October 2008 margin call letter.’ Right? A. Yes. [emphasis added] 268 The Plaintiffs submitted that if the fact that Juan had to present the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter to Pan at the meeting was weighing on Sze’s mind, he must have taken note and would have remembered if Juan physically gave a copy of the letter to Pan.341Foot Note 341×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 163. 269 As for Chiu, despite being the “policeman” to make sure that Pan was handed the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, Chiu deposed in his AEIC that he did not have any specific recollection of the 6 October 2008 Meeting.342Foot Note 342×Chiu’s affidavit dated 12 January 2018 (“Chiu’s affidavit”) at para 42.He also deposed that in October 2008, he was attending to margin call issues of other customers as well.343Foot Note 343×Chiu’s affidavit at para 42.Chiu was not cross-examined on these matters in his AEIC. 270 I find that the evidence from the employees of DB of the 6 October 2008 Meeting does not assist DB in proving that Pan was handed the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter. 271 Next, I note that the call report for the 6 October 2008 Meeting which was logged by Juan on 15 October 2008 did not state that Juan had handed Pan the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter during the meeting.344Foot Note 344×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 159; 55AB 42223.While the omission to state this in the call report does not necessarily mean that Juan had omitted to hand Pan the letter, the omission to state so in the call report does not assist DB in proving that Pan was handed the letter. 272 I proceed to consider the communications between the Plaintiffs and DB after 6 October 2008. 273 On 8 October 2008, there was a telephone conversation at or around 7.52pm between Chang and Juan.345Foot Note 345×See 59AB 45652–45667.The duration of the conversation was over 17 minutes, and the conversation was conducted in Mandarin, interspersed with some English words. I reproduce a portion of the English translation of the transcript for this conversation, and have underlined the words which were spoken in English during the conversation:346Foot Note 346×59AB 45661. … [Juan]: But,Grace, frankly speaking, it has already reached this situation already, actually---actuallythe bankit will---itwill really close out everything. [Chang]: Will everything what? [Juan]: Will close out all the positions. [Chang]: Will close out all the positions? [Juan]: Mm, becausethemargin call, theshortfall, the feeling is it is endless. [Chang]: Correct. … [emphasis added] 274 On 9 October 2008, there was a telephone conversation at or around 11.27am between Chang, Juan, Sze and another DB employee.347Foot Note 347×See 59AB 45693–45705.The duration of the conversation was over 12 minutes, and the conversation was conducted in Mandarin, interspersed with some English words. I reproduce a portion of the English translation of the transcript for this conversation, and have underlined the words which were spoken in English during the conversation:348Foot Note 348×59AB 45697, 45699. … [Juan]: Er,Grace, actuallywe want to close outat the same time is also to protect Mr Pan’s asset, but at the same timeis also because ofmargin call. [Chang]: I always felt--- [Juan]:Okay---so I say cannot---we cannot keep telling Mr Pan that it’s because ofmargin callthen we have to do in this way, but actually this is---it is equivalent to we--- (Speakers speaking simultaneously) [Chang]: Correct, it is not wrong, I know, I know your (plural)margin call, but Mr Pan always felt thatmargin callhas been brought up a long time ago. Within a period of time you can do it also, you don’t have to wait until the last daymargin callwhen it must be done then do it. [Juan]: Mm. … [Sze]: …Grace, I---I know Mr Pan is very angry with thismargin callproblem. [Chang]: Ah. [Sze]: But today ourmargin call(inaudible) is very serious. … [Chang]: You must face this problem. [Sze]: ---all of us have pressure,managementasked us to tell Mr Pan if he couldclose outtheaccumulatorfirst. [Chang]: Mm. … [emphasis added] 275 Through these two telephone conversations between Chang and DB’s employees on 8 October 2008 and 9 October 2008, it can be seen that they were discussing the issue of amargin calland the question of DBclosing outpositions under the Accounts. 276 I then consider again the telephone conversation on 13 October 2008 at or around 1.59pm involving Pan and Sze, which was set out at [230] above. As DB submitted, Pan had used the words “margin call” in English at four points during the telephone conversation (which was conducted mainly in Mandarin and Cantonese), as follows:349Foot Note 349×See Defendant’s Closing Submissions at paras 136, 155(e). (a) “I don’t wish you guys to give us any moremargin call. You guys think how (you) want to come out, we come and make a final decision …” (b) “Then again I don’t have any money to use. Everyday it seems I havemargin callagain.” (c) “Then now you wantmargin callagain.” (d) “Everyday telling me, telephoning me to say you havemargin callnow.” I reproduce also two of Sze’s replies during this conversation: (a) “… ourteamwill discuss about it again, the things that need to beclose outwill be close out …” [emphasis added]. (b) “… we will determine what we willclose outnow, that is, which position to close out” [emphasis added]. 277 With respect to this telephone conversation, Pan testified that he understood “margin calls” to mean “insufficient assets”,350Foot Note 350×See Pan’s affidavit at para 374; NEs 07/03/18 at p 73 lines 3–25, p 74 lines 1–15.and Chang testified that she and Pan understood a “margin call” to mean that the Plaintiffs were “short of money”.351Foot Note 351×NEs 14/03/18 at p 11 lines 4–7, p 26 lines 19–25, p 27 line 1.The Plaintiffs submitted that Pan could not have been using “margin call” in the “formal sense”, because it was not even DB’s case that it made margin calls in the formal sense every day, but only that there was a collateral shortfall every day from 3 October 2008 to 13 October 2008.352Foot Note 352×See Plaintiffs’ Reply Closing Submissions at para 76. 278 I do not accept that Pan understood “margin calls” to only mean “insufficient assets”, and I do not accept that Pan was ignorant in that a “margin call” meant a notice to deliver additional collateral only. The fact that Pan used the words “margin call” in English, when the telephone conversation was conducted mainly in Mandarin and Cantonese, suggested that Pan was comfortable with the English words “margin call” and that he understood the meaning they carried. This is unsurprising as he was an experienced investor. I also note that Chang in her AEIC deposed that during a telephone conversation on 8 August 2008, some two months before 13 October 2008, she told Juan that “[Pan] wants to tell me [Chang] what a margin call is”.353Foot Note 353×See Chang’s affidavit at para 43; 57AB 44458 (telephone conversation on 8 August 2008 at or around 1.01pm). 279 Sze’s replies on closing out positions under the Accounts were also consistent with the consequence of a margin call if further collateral were not provided. Pan did not express surprise at Sze’s replies, and in fact, Pan expected such a response; he had asked Sze to get back to him for a final decision as to which positions to close out (see [233] above). 280 Sze’s replies must also be considered against the backdrop of the prior telephone conversations between Chang and DB’s employees on 4 October 2008, 8 October 2008 and 9 October 2008. Whilst Pan was not involved in these conversations, these conversations show consistency in how DB discussed the issue ofmargin callacross the telephone conversations on 4 October 2008, 8 October 2008, 9 October 2008 and 13 October 2008. DB’s consistency, in discussing the issue of margin call with the closing out of positions under the Accounts, makes it difficult for me to believe that Pan was ignorant of the consequence of a margin call and only thought “margin calls” to mean “insufficient assets” without the need for the Plaintiffs to undertake any steps. 281 Therefore, whilst the telephone conversation on 13 October 2008 did not expressly mention or refer to the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter or any other margin call letter, Pan’s reference to “margin call” must have been to a margin call DB had made to the Plaintiffs. Even if Chang did not inform Pan of the margin call of 3 October 2008, in my view, Pan had been informed by DB at the 6 October 2008 Meeting of the substance of the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter pertaining to the FX GEM account, as well as the substance of the attachment to the 3 October 2008 E-mail,ie, the 3 October 2008 Margin Call Letter, pertaining to Zillion’s advisory account. This was so even if neither the 6 October 2008 Margin Call Letter nor the 3 October 2008 E-mail and its attachment were in fact handed to Pan on 6 October 2008. 282 Chang who attended the 6 October 2008 Meeting was also aware that Pan had been so informed. That is why when there were follow-up telephone conversations on 8 October 2008 and 9 October 2008 between DB and Chang, references were made to “margin call”, “shortfall” and the point that, “Mr Pan is very angry with thismargin callproblem”, and Chang did not at any time say that Pan was unaware of any margin call. That is why on 13 October 2008, Pan said to Sze that he did not want DB to give any more margin call. 283 The reference by Pan to, “Everyday it seems I havemargin callagain” was not a reference to fresh margin calls daily but rather that DB was constantly pressing the Plaintiffs to come up with a solution in that period, from 3 October 2008 to 13 October 2008, such that Pan felt as though DB was making margin calls daily. 284 Likewise when Pan said, “Everyday telling me, telephoning me to say you havemargin callnow”, this was Pan’s way of referring to the frequent discussions which DB was having with Chang, if not with him, about the unresolved margin calls during that period such that he felt as though DB was making margin calls daily. 285 Accordingly by 13 October 2008, Pan had had more than one business day’s notice of a margin call. Again his subsequent complaint to DB was not that he had not been given time to resolve the margin call issue but that he had not authorised any close-out. 286 I thus find that DB gave the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement orally, if not in writing, before closing out the positions under the Accounts through the 13 October 2008 Transactions. I therefore find that DB did not breach the contracts between it and the Plaintiffs by closing out the positions. 287 It may be that the Plaintiffs could have instead claimed that DB had waived its right to close out until Sze had gotten back to Pan that day, and that had Sze gotten back to Pan, Pan would have agreed to close out other positions than those which DB closed out,ie, the 13 October 2008 Transactions. However, that was not the basis of the Plaintiffs’ claim on the close-out issue. Further comments 288 I will briefly address one other point in relation to the Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract when DB closed out certain positions under the Accounts through the 13 October 2008 Transactions. Relying on various contract terms, DB had a further position that it was in any event entitled to terminate and/or close out the outstanding transactions in the Accounts as the margin cover and/or the collateral value was inadequate, and/or the close-out ratios were reached (see [227] above). DB did not substantiate this further position with reasons. I do not understand DB’s further position because at face value, it appears that those contract terms which DB relied on might still have required it to give reasonable notice to the Plaintiffs before closing out positions under the Accounts (seeLam Chi Kin Davidat [29(b)]354Foot Note 354×See Plaintiffs’ Closing Submissions at para 123(d).),ie, a similar analysis would have to be conducted as for whether DB gave the requisite notice under cl 2.6 of the Master Agreement. I nevertheless make no further comments on this.",
        "Issue of negligence": "114 I proceed to consider the Plaintiffs’ claim for negligence.",
        "Issue of misrepresentation": "171 I proceed to consider the Plaintiffs’ claim for misrepresentation.",
        "Issue of breach of contract by closing out positions through the 13 October 2008 Transactions": "223 I proceed to consider the Plaintiffs’ claim for breach of contract when DB closed out certain positions under the Accounts through the 13 October 2008 Transactions.",
        "Other issues": "289 In the light of my decision on the Plaintiffs’ four main heads of claim, it is not necessary for me to consider whether there was any contract term that sought to exclude or restrict DB’s liability and whether such a term was enforceable (see [73] above). In this regard, I mention that these were points the parties submitted on, in their closing submissions, in relation to the heads of claim for negligence and misrepresentation. 290 It is also not necessary for me to elaborate on the issue of a time bar.",
        "Conclusion": "291 In the circumstances, I dismiss the Plaintiffs’ claims against DB. 292 I will hear the parties on costs.
