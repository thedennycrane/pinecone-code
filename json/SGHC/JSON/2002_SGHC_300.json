In\n\nthis case, the problems were compounded by partnership disputes. The plaintiffs therefore\n\nlicensed a substantial part of their property to the defendants so that the latter could\n\nin turn sub-licence to third parties. They also engaged the defendants to manage their\n\nbusiness, which was principally sub-lettings to their own sub-tenants. As will be seen,\n\nthe arrangements have spawn this piece of litigation.2\n\n        In this action, the plaintiff partnership, for\n\nwhich a Receiver and Manager was appointed by Order of Court made on 25 September 1998,\n\nclaim from the defendants the sum of $912,154.25 or such other sum that may be found to be\n\ndue for the balance of the monthly fee payable to the plaintiffs by the defendants for the\n\nuse of the woodworking factory area and the open space area for the period between 13\n\nFebruary 1997 to 11 February 1999. According to the plaintiffs the gross licensing fee was\n\n$1,753,428.60 and they gave credit to the defendants for the payment of $841,274.35\n\nalready made. They further claim the sum of $198,631.08 due from the defendants to the\n\nplaintiffs for the expenses incurred by the Receiver for the dismantling of the\n\nunauthorised structures and for the removal of the debris from the plaintiffs’\n\npremises. They also claim interest on all moneys found to be due to the plaintiffs at the\n\nrate of 6% per annum from the date of the writ of summons to the date of judgment and\n\ncosts.3\n\n        According to the defence, the gross licensing\n\nfee for the period of 2 years should be $1,184, 437.20 and not the sum of $1,753,428.60 as\n\nthe plaintiffs have alleged. The defendants further claim that under another agreement\n\nthey had with the plaintiffs, namely the Management Agreement, they were entrusted with\n\nthe management of the property and they claim the expenses of $589,497.18 which are\n\nparticularised in exhibit P2 and elaborated in exhibits D2 and D3. All three exhibits were\n\ndocuments in the nature of Scott’s Schedule which I had directed to be prepared for\n\nease of reference. They were schedules of items, the amounts, the grounds why the\n\nplaintiffs have rejected them and the reasons which the defendants rely on in support of\n\ntheir claims for reimbursements. Thirdly, and finally, the defendants counterclaim\n\nliquidated damages in the sum of $944,524.20 which they allegedly suffered by reason of\n\nthe plaintiffs’ wrongful termination and repudiation of the licensing agreement.\n\nAlternatively, the defendants seek the entry of an interlocutory judgement for wrongful\n\nrepudiation and for damages to be assessed by the Registrar. I now turn to the background.The background4\n\n        The plaintiffs were at all material times the\n\nlessees of the industrial premises at No. 44, Sungei Kadut Street, Singapore (\"the\n\npremises\") of which the lessor was the Jurong Town Corporation (\"JTC\").\n\nThey were a partnership firm dealing in, until the events hereinafter recited, sawmilling\n\nand carpentry works. The partnership encountered partnership disputes and they were\n\ndissolved by an Order of Court on 25 September 1998 and Mr Don Ho Mun-Tuke (\"Mr Don\n\nHo\") was appointed the Receiver and Manager.5\n\n        Sometime in early 1997, the defendants, which\n\nwere associated with one of the partners by ties of kinship, were invited by the\n\nplaintiffs to help manage the premises. This was necessary because the partners were at\n\nloggerheads and matters of the firm suffered. Matters deteriorated, arrears of rent from\n\ntheir subtenants mounted and the premises were left in a state of disrepair. The\n\nplaintiffs granted a licence to the defendants to use a substantial portion of the\n\npremises for differentiated monthly licence fees and they also appointed the defendants to\n\nrun the business of the plaintiffs, which was then solely the business of subletting, and\n\nto maintain the premises, keeping them in a state of tenantable repair.6\n\n        The Licensing Agreement (\"the Licensing\n\nAgreement\") was entered into under an agreement dated 13 February 1997. Under it, the\n\ndefendants agreed to use up to 30,000 square feet of the woodworking factory area\n\n(\"the woodworking area\") and up to 100,000 square feet of the open space area\n\n(\"the open space area\") for a period of sixty (60) months with effect from 13\n\nFebruary, 1997, expiring on 12 February 2002. Both areas were delineated in a plan. The\n\nmonthly licence fee for the woodworking area was $1.20 per square foot and for the open\n\nspace area was 60 cts per square foot. The Licensing Agreement conferred on the defendants\n\nthe right to sub-license their portion of the premises to third parties. A schedule of the\n\ndefendants’ various sub-licensees is attached to the affidavit evidence in chief of\n\nMr Lim Lung Tieng.7\n\n        It was also agreed that the defendants were to\n\npay to the plaintiffs all utilities charges by meter reading promptly on demand upon\n\npresentation of the invoices for the same by the plaintiffs to the defendants. That was\n\nbecause the plaintiffs continued to pay for the utilities to the Public Utilities Board.8\n\n        There was a termination clause. Under it, the\n\ndefendants or the plaintiffs were entitled to give the other party four (4) months’\n\nnotice in the event that either party wished to terminate the Licence Agreement and in the\n\nevent the plaintiffs were to terminate the Licence Agreement upon giving the requisite\n\nfour (4) months’ notice, the defendants were allowed to use and occupy the\n\nwoodworking and open space areas without the need to pay the plaintiffs the monthly\n\nservice and supervision fee during the notice period.9\n\n        By the Management Agreement between the parties\n\nhereto and dated 30 March, 1997 the defendants agreed to assist the plaintiffs in carrying\n\nout various matters in relation to the maintenance of the premises and the running of the\n\nplaintiffs’ business. The relevant portion of the Management Agreement stated:\"We confirm our agreement\n\n    that you are to help us:-1) do necessary repairs and\n\n    maintenance works etc to the land, structure and drains etc in our premises including the\n\n    part on electricity supply,2) pay worker’s salary &\n\n    Central Provident Fund contribution including wages of odd job labourer hired to assist in\n\n    the above mentioned repairs and maintenance,…..6)    dispose any unused machinery\n\n    at reasonable amount or being properly disposed of and,7)Any expenses that may (sic)\n\n    incurred in the running of our businessfor which you are to deduct the\n\n    expenses from the outstanding payable to us and the above will include favour done to us\n\n    since 13-2-1997\"(emphasis added to focus attention.)The Preliminary Issue10\n\n        At the beginning of the trial, I acceded to the\n\njoint application of both counsel that I address a preliminary question. I was told and I\n\nwas of the same view, having read the trial papers in advance, that the determination of\n\nthe preliminary question would save a considerable amount of time. The preliminary\n\nquestion was whether the plaintiffs’ claim for the sum of $912,154.25 allegedly due\n\nunder the Licensing Agreement and the defendants’ counterclaim for repudiatory breach\n\nof it ought to be dismissed because the Licensing Agreement is unenforceable. Initially,\n\nthe defendants relied on two grounds for unenforceability, namely illegality and public\n\npolicy. The Jurong Town Corporation Act (Cap. 150) (\"the Act\") did not\n\ncriminalise or even prohibit subletting of industrial properties under JTC leases or\n\nlicence, unlike the case of subletting of residential properties under JTC leases is\n\nunlawful under section 51 read with section 36 of the Act. It was not possible to identify\n\nany illegality. Therefore public policy remained as the sole ground for unenforceability.11\n\n        For the purposes of the preliminary question,\n\nsome further facts were agreed. Under the then applicable JTC guidelines, the subletting\n\nof JTC land and industrial building was subject to the approval of JTC and the relevant\n\nGovernment authorities. A party applying for approval was required to pay to JTC a\n\nsubletting fee and administrative fee. The application would have to be completed by both\n\nthe lessee/applicant and the proposed sub-tenant and submitted by the lessee/applicant to\n\nJTC. Under the JTC 21 Policy, which came into force in or about August 1997, the\n\nsubletting of open land was not allowed. It was also common ground that no application for\n\napproval was submitted to JTC in respect of the Licensing Agreement. The Licensing\n\nAgreement included open space.12\n\n        It was submitted on behalf of the defendants\n\nthat it would be contrary to public policy to allow the claim. He relied on the agreed\n\nfacts which established that JTC, the principal engine for industrial development in\n\nSingapore, did not permit the subletting of open space and did not permit any subletting\n\nwithout its prior approval. But JTC was not without its remedies. The lease prohibited\n\nsubletting and JTC had its rights, including the rights of forfeiture. For reasons of good\n\nindustrial and sensitive management, they elected to give all concerned time to\n\nunscramble. It was fully aware of the subletting but it allowed them sufficient time for\n\narrangements to be made to enable unauthorised sub-tenants to find alternative premises.\n\nFor myself, I would decline from venturing into the proper province of public policy in\n\nrelation to subletting of industrial properties in respect of which JTC is professionally\n\nand administratively, armed with all relevant data and institutional knowledge and staffed\n\nby experienced officers, the best statutory agency to make the calls of judgment.13\n\n        The sanctity of a contract freely entered into\n\nshould not be invalidated without good legal reason. Where the doctrine of public policy\n\nis invoked, there is a need to be circumspect for under its guise courts may rush in where\n\nangels fear to tread. There are a number of reported cases where public policy has been\n\nshown to be an unruly horse. In this connection, the following dicta of Asquith LJ inMonkland\n\nv Jack Barclay, Ltd[1951] 1 All ER 714, at p 723A is helpful: \"Certain specific\n\ncases of contracts have been ruled by authority to be contrary to the policy of the law,\n\nwhich is, of course, not the same thing as the policy of the government, whatever its\n\ncomplexion-e.g., marriage brokerage contracts, contracts for the sale of honours,\n\ncontracts in restraint of trade and so on. The courts have again and again said that,\n\nwhere a contract does not fit into one or other of these pigeon-holes but lies outside\n\nthis charmed circle, the courts should use extreme reserve in holding a contract to be\n\nvoid as against public policy, and should only do so when the contract is incontestably\n\nand on any view inimical to the public interest:…\".14\n\n        The defendants rely onTan Seng Huat v\n\nGolden Seal Pte Ltd[Suit No. 1632 of 1996]. The decision of the High Court was\n\ndelivered on 30 April 1998. It is not reported. The High Court in that case dismissed the\n\nplaintiffs’ claim for vacant possession of their JTC factory, reinstatement costs and\n\nmesne profits and at the same time dismissed the counterclaim of the defendants for\n\ndamages resulting from the plaintiffs’ breach of an alleged tenancy agreement. The\n\nHigh Court noted that both parties were aware that JTC approval to sublet had not been\n\nobtained and that they had taken the risks of moving into the premises anyway. According\n\nto the High Court, neither party deserved the Court’s sympathy.15\n\n        At para 56 of the judgment, which dealt with a\n\nwhole hosts of other facts not relevant for present purposes, the Court stated:\"Consequently, the plaintiff\n\n    is not entitled to the reliefs he has claimed against Golden Seal nor Golden Seal to its\n\n    counterclaim. The profit should not profit from Golden Seal’s occupation of the\n\n    premises and neither should Golden Seal be reimbursed any of its costs and consequential\n\n    loss in moving into and then out, of the factory; both sides were equally blameworthy-they\n\n    were aware of and took the risk of Golden Seal’s moving in without the blessings of\n\n    the JTC and without TOP; neither deserve the Court’s sympathy\".16\n\n        The reasoning in terms and in language was not\n\ngrounded on public policy. I am not sure that there was an explicit ruling that the\n\ncontract of sub-tenancy was contrary to public policy. If public policy was the ground for\n\nnot enforcing the rights of the parties in the claims and counter-claim, I am ineluctably\n\ndriven to say that the scope of public policy invalidating the sub-contract cannot go that\n\nfar. It was an extension of public policy which, for my own part, I would not make.The claims and counterclaims17\n\n        Before I deal with the claims and\n\ncounterclaims, I should recite the facts as gleaned from the evidence of the witnesses.\n\nThough Mr Don Ho had come upon the scene after his appointment as the receiver and\n\nmanager, he attended the premises immediately after his appointment. The plaintiffs had\n\nceased sawmilling and carpentry business. He ascertained that the gross area of the\n\npremises was 400,000 square feet. The defendants were in occupation and use of the whole\n\nof the woodworking factory area and the open space within the plaintiffs’ premises\n\nfrom 13 February until 27 September 1999. A small number of the subtenants of the\n\nplaintiffs remained. On 27 September 1999 the defendants delivered possession of the\n\nplaintiffs’ premises to Mr Don Ho in response to his demands to vacate and deliver up\n\nvacant possession after JTC had set the deadline. In the correspondence it was very clear\n\nthat JTC had required the plaintiffs to remove all the sub-tenants. It was very clear from\n\nthe evidence and correspondence disclosed in 2AB384, 391, 402 to 405 and 418that the\n\ndefendants in truth and in fact were given and had taken about 8 months to deliver vacant\n\npossession which was required by JTC.After they had left, the premises were sold by\n\nMr Don Ho. The plaintiffs sold their residue of 6 years interest in the JTC leasehold.18\n\n        I now turn to the plaintiffs’ claim for\n\nthe monthly licence fees. According to Mr Don Ho he had perused copies of the documents,\n\nincluding the warehousing agreements which the defendants had entered with various other\n\nsub-sub licencees. He was able to ascertain that the monthly fees payable to the\n\nplaintiffs by the defendants for their use and occupation of the premises was\n\n$1,753,428.60. He prepared a spreadsheet from the documents produced by the defendants\n\nduring the discovery process. It is marked DHMT-1 and appeared as Schedule A annexed to\n\nthe RE-Amended Statement of Claim. His evidence was not dented in cross examination. Mr\n\nLim Lung Tieng gave evidence for the defendants. He said that the defendants’ monthly\n\nstatements were furnished to the receiver and manager. He disclosed that the defendants\n\nearned a gross profit of $31,484.14 per month on the basis of the highest occupancy rate.\n\nThat highest occupancy rate occurred during the latter part of 1998. I should be noted\n\nthat the management lasted from February 1997 to September 1999. The preponderance of the\n\ndocumentary evidence support the plaintiffs’ claim for the licensing fees. I reject\n\nthe defendants assertion that the gross licensing fees were less.19\n\n        I next turn to the defendants’ claims for\n\ndeduction of expenses from the amounts they had to pay the plaintiffs. The expenses were\n\nsaid to total $589,497.18 less some items which the parties had expressly agreed before\n\nme. The plaintiffs prepared the Schedule of Disputed claims where they set out their\n\nreasons for rejecting the claims. The schedule is marked as exhibit P2. In my judgment,\n\nbased on the totality of the evidence, it was demonstrated by the plaintiffs all expenses\n\nwere actually incurred by and for the benefit of the defendants. The reasons are all set\n\nout in the third column of exhibit P2. I need not repeat them. The defendants’ claims\n\nfor the so-called expenses are therefore rejected, save for those which the plaintiffs\n\nhave agreed.20\n\n        The plaintiffs claim that the defendants are\n\nliable to pay to them the debris disposal charges which they had paid to remove them. They\n\ntotalled $198,631.08. The hardcore debris were incontestably left behind by the\n\nsub-tenants of the defendants. There were photographs showing the debris. They were left\n\nbehind by Hong Wee Construction Pte Ltd (\"Hong Wee\"). Mr Kelvin Lim, a witness\n\nfor the defendants, explained that Hong Wee was the sub-tenants of Hean Nerng Holdings Pte\n\nLtd (\"HNH\"). HNH was a related company of the defendants. Mr Kelvin Lim in cross\n\nexamination admitted that the defendants were responsible to clear the debris left behind\n\nby their sub-tenants. He said Hong Wee had wanted to re-cycle the debris but did not do\n\nso. In fact, HNH had sued Hong Wee in the Subordinate Courts for the self-same costs for\n\nthe removal of the debris. Another witness of the defendants, Mr Lim Heng Choon, told the\n\ncourt that it was the defendants and/or their sub-tenants and not the plaintiffs who were\n\nresponsible for the clearance of the debris left behind by the defendants’\n\nsub-tenants. I therefore allow plaintiffs’ claims for reimbursement of the costs for\n\nthe removal of the debris.21\n\n        I turn to what is superficially a substantial\n\ncounterclaims of the defendants for damages by reason of the wrongful repudiation of the\n\nLicence Agreement. They in effect counterclaim for loss of profits for the residue of the\n\nLicence Agreement of 2 years and 6 months. The first matter to note is that the Licence\n\nAgreement provided for its termination on the expiry of the 4 months’ notice.\n\nFurther, the defendants continued to enjoy the premises for 8 months before they vacated\n\nin September 1999. In fact, the defendants knew full well that JTC wanted the clearance of\n\nthe site of all authorised sub-tenants. They left without any demur.22\n\n        InGunton v Richmond-Upon-Thames London\n\nBorough Council[1981] 1 WLR 448 the plaintiff was dismissed without compliance with a\n\ncontractually binding procedure. The damages to be assessed was only up to the expiry of\n\nthe contractually due notice of one month notionally served on the day when the proper\n\ndisciplinary procedure, if followed, could have been concluded. Again, this rule was\n\npreviously invoked by the Privy Council inBritish Guiana Credit Corporation v Da Silva[1965] 1 WLR 248. The respondent was offered employment by the appellant as their general\n\nmanager under a 6 year contract (though a 3 year contract was found on appeal) and in\n\neither case, the contract was terminable upon 6 months’ notice. The appellant\n\nrepudiated the contract and the respondent sued for damages. The Privy Council concluded\n\nthat the claim for damages should be limited to 6 months. The Gunton’s rule is\n\nconsistent with principle. To rule otherwise would render otiose the earlier termination\n\nclause. It is not permissible to ignore the clear bargains in a contract. Counsel for the\n\ndefendants in his response filed in court by way of his letter of 19 November 2002\n\nsubmitted that inBritish Guiana Credit Corporationthere was no express term that\n\nthe contract of service could be terminated by 6 months’ notice. In my view, this was\n\nimmaterial to the principle of assessment of damages. The controversy in that case, where\n\nthe respondent was appointed but yet did not take office before his dismissal, proceeded\n\non the basis that it was contemplated by both parties that there would be a termination\n\nclause. The negotiations contemplated the finalisation of the terms of contract. As for\n\nwhat was the reasonable period, the respondent himself had suggested 6 months in one of\n\nthe documents. The ruling was that damages would be for the period of the notice if one\n\nhad been given in accordance with the contract.23\n\n        The defendants rely onIn re London and\n\nColonial Company Ex parte Clark[L.R.] 7 Eq 550. It was submitted that the fact that a\n\nfixed term contract was terminable by notice does not ipso facto bar the innocent party\n\nfrom claiming damages in relation to the unexpired term of the agreement. The court ruled,\n\nit was pointed out, that Mr Clark was entitled to his salary for the remaining period of\n\nhis service agreement and not just for the 6 months’ period. In that case, the\n\ncontract between the limited trading company and Mr Clark was that he as an agent would be\n\npaid a salary of oe750 a year for a period of 5 years from the day of his arrival at the\n\ncolony. In addition, he was to be allowed certain commission on remittances in money or\n\nproduce which should be made by him to England. Mr Clark was to pay up at once oe2 per\n\nshare of fifty shares of oe100 each, which he had been required to take up in the company,\n\nand the company agreed from time to time to place oe8 per share, as well as all other sums\n\nthat might become due from the agent, to his debit on account of the calls to be made to\n\nhim on the shares. It is clear that this was an agency agreement coupled with a separate\n\nshare subscription agreement involving part paid shares with calls upon the agent from\n\ntime to time during the period of the appointment. That case is miles away from the\n\ninstant case. Although the reasons were not altogether transparent in the report, it seems\n\nto me the contract required Mr Clark to be paid the full salary to enable him to pay on\n\nthe calls for the shares. Accordingly, the case does not assist the defendants.24\n\n        In my view, the defendants were given ample\n\nnotice and they had more than the 4 months to vacate. They did not suffer any damages.\n\nThey were quite happy to vacate. They accepted the notice to vacate because they were\n\nfully aware that that was the requirement of JTC. The plaintiffs were not in repudiation\n\nof the Licence Agreement. Finally, I accept the contention of the plaintiffs that if there\n\nwas any repudiatory breach on their part the same had been waived by the conduct of the\n\ndefendants. They had accepted the situation and they left, though they did so only after 8\n\nmonths without any demur or protest whatsoever.25\n\n        In the premises, there will be judgment for the\n\nplaintiffs as claimed. The claims of set-off and counterclaims of the defendants are\n\ndismissed with costs. The parties are directed to settle the Order and submit the same for\n\nmy approval.Sgd:Lai Kew ChaiJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
