        "SUM 735/2008 in OS1889/2007": "12     In SUM 735/2008 in the OS, STX applied for the amount under injunction to be increased by US$1m. The ground for this application was that Herry, Aria and Ashbury had been delaying the arbitration proceedings and substantial contractual interest and costs had accrued as a result. Meanwhile Herry, Aria and Ashbury had not filed any affidavit of assets and Herry had only filed an affidavit disclosing the details of certain accounts in the Singapore branch of Goldman Sachs. However Herry gave contradictory accounts in the various affidavits he filed, at first stating that he had only two accounts, then later disclosing more accounts. In view of this, and my further finding that they had failed to comply with my orders, I decided to reinstate the original order of 2 January 2008 and required Herry, Aria and Ashbury to file affidavit of assets by 27 March 2008 unless they were able to provide, by that date, an unconditional banker’s guarantee or other security acceptable to STX in the amount of US$5.8m (an increase of US$0.8m from the original US$5m). I ordered costs against the defendants to be taxed if not agreed.",
        "SUM 652/2008 in S64/2008": "13     In SUM 652/2008 in the Suit, STX applied for a Mareva injunction in the sum of US$1.2m. The cause of action in the Suit is based on a written agreement dated 27 March 2007 in which Herry and Aria undertook to pay STX a sum of US$1,464,076 by way of compromise and compensation for losses suffered by STX under a contract between STX and PTBI. At the material time Herry was the president director and Aria the chief executive officer of PTBI. The statement of claim alleged that Herry had acknowledged the sum owing by making part payment of US$350,000 on 6 June 2007 leaving a balance of US$1,114,070. Herry further acknowledged this outstanding sum by way of a letter to STX dated 20 September 2007 in which he promised to make full payment by the end of November 2007. However Herry and Aria failed to make any further payments despite a letter of demand on 24 January 2008. STX had exhibited these documents in affidavits filed on its behalf. 14     The grounds for the application for the Mareva injunction were similar to those in the OS and, being satisfied that STX had made out its case of a risk of dissipation of assets by Herry and Aria, I granted an order in terms of the application in the sum of US$1.2m. I also gave a similar condition that if Herry and Aria could provide a banker’s guarantee in that sum, then the injunction would be discharged. I ordered costs to be in the cause.",
        "SUM 725/2008 in S64/2008": "15     In SUM 725/2008 in the Suit, Herry and Aria applied for a stay of the action on the ground offorum non conveniens. Counsel for the defendants in the Suit stated that the defence is that they were the wrong parties being sued as they had signed the settlement agreement of 27 March 2007 as agents of PTBI and did not assume any personal liability. He submitted that in the event STX obtains judgment, it would be against PTBI and STX would have to commence further proceedings in Indonesia resulting in a multiplicity of proceedings. He pointed out that the parties have no connection with Singapore. Counsel for STX pointed out that the issue of multiplicity of proceedings was not raised by the defendants on affidavit. 16     However the arbitration clause in the underlying contract between STX and PTBI contained an arbitration clause that provides for arbitration in Singapore under UNCITRAL rules and does not specify the governing law. The Suit pertains to agreements between Korean and Indonesian parties under contracts in which the governing law is not specified. The defendants have assets in Singapore. In the circumstances, I did not agree that the action should be stayed on the ground offorum non conveniens. I accordingly dismissed the application with costs to STX fixed at $2,000. _________________ [note: 1]Article 10 provides as follows: 10.1         It is agreed that in the event of any controversy, claim, difference, dispute or question (collectively, a “Dispute”) arising under or in connection or relation to this Agreement or any difference regarding its existence, validity or termination or with respect to any alleged breach hereof, the Parties shall seek to resolve the Dispute amicably through discussions between them. Only if the Parties fail to resolve such Dispute by amicable arrangement with 30 days of first notice thereof by any Party may a Party initiate arbitration as set forth below.10.2         Subject to Article 10.1, any Dispute shall only be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in Singapore in English in accordance with the Arbitration Rules of the Singapore Arbitration Centre (“SIAC Rules”) then in force which rules are deemed to be incorporated by reference into this clause. The decision of any board of arbitration constituted under the SIAC Rules shall be final, binding and incontestable and shall be used as a basis for the enforcement thereof in any jurisdiction. Any decision, award or judgment of the board of arbitration may, without limitation, be brought to the relevant Indonesian court for enforcement in Indonesia in accordance with the New York Convention on the Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards."
