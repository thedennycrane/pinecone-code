        "Background": "6       The\nfacts of the case are at once few and many. The basic premise of this\napplication, as stated above, was that the joint tenancy was severed\nand the defendant claimed equitable relief. Yet, the factual background\nof the case as presented by the parties spanned the lifetime of\nthe plaintiff and contained allegation upon counter-allegation of\ninstances of inequitable behaviour by both parties. In cases brought\nin equity, the most important findings relate to whether the facts\nof the case fit within the contours of recognised equitable doctrines,\nand whether the facts justify the court granting equitable relief.\nFor that reason, only the background of the case will be set out\nhere, and the myriad and sometimes disputed facts of the case will\nbe set out in more detail as each equitable doctrine is considered. One\npoint that should be noted at the outset is that although the defendant repeatedly\nstressed the strength of her relationship with the plaintiff, this would\nbe relevant only insofar as it substantiated the factors constituting the\ndoctrines under which she claimed equitable relief. The supposed closeness\nbetween mother and daughter would not be a relevant factor in the\nabstract. 7       The\ndefendant’s husband, who was the plaintiff’s father, walked out on\nthe defendant and their four daughters in 1983. The plaintiff was\nthe second daughter, and she had an elder sister and a pair of younger\ntwin sisters (“the twins”). Since that time, the defendant raised\nall four children singlehandedly, working as a factory worker and\nrunning small businesses to make ends meet. She applied to the court\nfor a separation order and maintenance from her husband in 1983,\nand was awarded $300 monthly maintenance. The defendant obtained\na divorce from her husband in 1998, by which time all of her daughters\nhad started working and the family’s financial difficulties eased. 8       Until\nabout 1998, the defendant and all her daughters were staying in a\nHousing Development Board (“HDB”) flat located in Choa Chu Kang. After\nher divorce, the defendant sold this flat and purchased another\nHDB flat in Bishan (“the Bishan flat”) for $360,000. This was conveyed\ninto the joint names of the defendant and all her daughters save\nfor one of the twins. Each joint owner made varying contributions\nto the purchase price of the Bishan flat. The defendant claimed\nto have contributed about $10,000 cash and about $610 from her CPF\nmoneys to the purchase price. She also claimed to have contributed\nabout $94 towards the monthly mortgage sum for an unspecified amount\nof time. The plaintiff on her part contributed $18,340 cash and\nalso helped to service the monthly mortgage sum. 9       The\nentire family lived in the Bishan flat until sometime in 2001 when the\nplaintiff’s elder sister wished to divest her interest in the Bishan\nflat because she was about to get married and wanted to purchase\na HDB flat with her future husband. The twin sister who was a co-owner\nalso wished to do the same in anticipation of marriage in the future.\nThe plaintiff agreed to purchase her two sisters’ shares, based\non a valuation of about $310,000. She took out a mortgage to finance\nthe buyout, and serviced the monthly instalments without any assistance\nfrom the defendant. The Bishan flat thenceforth was in the joint\nnames of the plaintiff and the defendant. After the buy-out, the\nplaintiff’s elder sister moved out followed by the plaintiff in 2004. 10     In\n2005, the plaintiff purchased a condominium at Eden Grove (“the Eden\nGrove property”) and conveyed it into the joint names of herself\nand the defendant. Neither of the parties lived there, and this\nproperty was sold sometime in 2007. 11     The\nProperty at issue in the present case was purchased in 2007 and conveyed\ninto the joint names of the parties. Around this time, the plaintiff suggested\nthat the Bishan flat would be sold, to which the defendant agreed. As\nwill be seen later, one of the defendant’s arguments before this\ncourt was that the sale of the Bishan flat served to substantiate\nher claim in proprietary estoppel. 12     The\ndefendant and the twins moved from the Bishan flat to live with the\nplaintiff and her then fiancé (now husband) Keith Anthony Lazaroo (“Mr Lazaroo”)\nat the Property. This was the beginning of much discord between\nthe parties with the twins siding with the defendant and Mr Lazaroo\nsiding with the plaintiff. According to the plaintiff, there was constant\nbickering between the defendant and the twins (from the time the parties\nresided at the Bishan flat so much so that the plaintiff moved out from\nthe flat). The plaintiff was herself critical of the twins’ behaviour.\nEach side made numerous allegations of the other party’s intolerable\nbehaviour, which allegations made up the bulk of the affidavits\nplaced before this court. This sad state of affairs culminated in\na strange incident in which the defendant and the twins engaged\na medium to enter the Property on the night of 2 March 2010 and\nwho forcibly performed ritualistic cleansing on the plaintiff, much\nto the plaintiff’s annoyance. The defendant later explained that\nshe felt that the plaintiff had become very bad tempered and when\nthe defendant consulted the medium, she was advised that the plaintiff\nwas possessed by spirits and needed to be subject to certain rituals. The\ndefendant emphasised that she had not meant to harm the plaintiff\nby her well-meaning Action. Nevertheless, the plaintiff told the\ndefendant the very next day (3 March 2010), that the plaintiff wished\nto sell the Property and that the defendant and the twins would\nhave to move out. The plaintiff herself moved out on 4 March 2010\nbut the defendant and the twins remained behind and refused to leave\nuntil they were evicted by the Sheriff pursuant to a writ of possession\nobtained by the plaintiff. 13     The\nProperty could not be sold unless both parties, who were joint tenants,\nagreed to the sale. On 18 May 2010, the plaintiff brought the first tranche\nof this Action under s 18 of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322,\n2007 Rev Ed) seeking an order that the Property be sold. I granted\nan order in terms on 29 July 2010, directing that the Property be sold\nand the defendant remove all her personal belongings and vacate\nthe Property within two weeks of the order. The defendant (and the\ntwins) did not obey this order and all three were evicted by the\nSheriff on 16 February 2011. The defendant had filed an appeal (in\nCivil Appeal No 142 of 2010) against my order for sale (seeNeo Hui Ling v Ang Ah Sew[2010] SGHC 328)\nbut did not pursue her appeal. The defendant claimed in court (and\nin her affidavit filed on 1 September 2010) that her lack of funds precluded\nher from pursuing her appeal. She had nevertheless relied on Civil\nAppeal No 142 of 2010 as the ground to apply to court for a stay\nof execution on the order for sale of the Property, which application\nwas granted by another court on 16 September 2010. The parties came\nbefore me again in October/November 2011 to determine the extent\nof their respective interests in the Property.",
        "The presumed intention resulting\ntrust": "14     The\ndefendant’s claim was that she should be beneficially entitled to\na half share in the sale proceeds because the Property was in the\nname of her daughter and herself as legal joint tenants. What the\ndefendant suggested was that equity should follow the law and the\nparties should hold the Property as equitable tenants in common\nin equal shares. The problem with the defendant’s claim was that\nequity does not look favourably on joint tenancies. This is due\nto the rule of survivorship being viewed as draconian and unfair,\ngiven that it disproportionately divests the deceased joint tenant of\nhis share of a property, vesting it in the surviving tenant (seeLau Siew Kim v Yeo Guan Chye Terence[2008]\n2 SLR(R) 108 (“Lau Siew Kim”) at[83], (a case not cited by the parties)\nand William Swadling, “Property: General Principles”, inEnglish Private Law(Andrew Burrows ed)\n(Oxford University Press, 2nded, 2007)\n(“English Private Law”) at 4.368).\nWhere the parties are joint tenants at law, and there are also clear\nindications that the parties were intended to hold as equitable\njoint tenants, then equity will follow the law. Where there are\nno clear indications of such intentions and the parties made equal\ncontributions to the purchase price, then equity would similarly\nfollow the law. However, where there are no clear indications of\nsuch intentions, and where the parties made unequal contributions\nto the purchase price of the property, then equity will presume\nthat they hold the property as beneficial tenants in common in shares\nproportionate to their contributions to the acquisition of that property.\nFor completeness it should also be noted that equity will also presume\na tenancy in common where the parties were commercial partners or\nwhere the purchase money was provided by way of mortgage, although these\nconsiderations were not relevant to the instant case (seeLau Siew Kimat[83]andEnglish Private Lawat 4.369). 15     On\nthe facts here, the parties were joint tenants at law. However,\nthere was no clear indication that the parties were also intended\nto hold as equitable joint tenants. Such clear indication would\nbe constituted by a clear statement from the parties, but in this\ncase what was clear instead was a dispute between the parties. The\ndefendant asserted an equitable joint tenancy, and the plaintiff\nstrenuously denied the same. The next inquiry would have to be into\nthe parties’ contributions to the purchase price. 16     The\nplaintiff claimed that she alone had paid for the Property. She stated\nin her AEIC (at paras 6 and 7): ...the Property was solely purchased by\nme. The purchase completed (sic) on 3 September 2009. All the capital\nand instalment payments, stamp fees and agent fees, mortgage loans,\nproperty tax payments required were paid for by me. The purchase\nprice of the property was S$1.88million. I took up a total of S$1,350,000.00 of\nhousing loans, in my own name, to finance the purchase of the Property. S/NItemsPrice(S$)1Purchase\nPrice1,880,000.002Agent\nFees8,000.003Stamp\nFees51,000.00Total1,939,000.004Less\nPayment of 5% deposit(94,000.00)5Cash\nPayment on completion(438,071.67)6Agent\nFees(8,000.00)7Stamp\nFees(51,000.00)8Remaining\nPurchase Price payable via a(sic) mortgage loans, CPF, etc1,347,928.33   The plaintiff also claimed to have paid for other outgoings\nsuch as property tax, fire insurance and renovation expenses. 17     The\ndefendant did not dispute this and candidly stated in her AEIC that\n“It is true that the Plaintiff alone paid for the purchase price\nof the Property.” She went on to state that the contributions which\nshe and the twins had made to the Property extended only to furniture\n(for their own use), and household expenses. The defendant did not\ndistinguish between payments made by her or the twins, and one reason\nfor this could be because the defendant was not working and her\nonly source of money was by way of contributions from her daughters.\nThe defendant stated that for a period of two and a half years till\nMarch 2010, she and the twins paid for the following monthly outgoings: Gardener$120 per monthStarhub TV Cable Service$200 per monthDomestic Cleaner$50 per weekGrocery & Marketing$200 per weekHandyman services and repairs$1,000 per annumPest control$280\nper annum   18     Their\ncontributions to the expenses amounted to about $1,426 a month.\nNotwithstanding this, the equitable doctrine clearly stated that\nthe contributions from the parties had to be towards thepurchase priceof the property, not the\nhousehold expenses. The Court of Appeal inLau\nSiew Kimmade it clear that such contributions were limited\nto those “direct” contributions to the purchase price. Contributions\nto the cost of repairs or renovation of a property might be relevant\nwhere such expenses were incurred shortly after purchase and led\nto an appreciation in the value of the property. The defendant’s\ncontributions did not fall into either of those categories and therefore\ncould not be regarded as contributions to the purchase price. 19     Given\nthat the defendant had not contributed to the purchase price of the\nProperty at all while the plaintiff had contributed solely, the contributions\nto the purchase price of the Property were unequal. The presumption\nthat the parties held the Property as beneficial tenants in common\nin shares proportionate to their contributions applied. In this case,\nit appeared that since the defendant contributed nothing towards\nthe acquisition of the Property, she would have no share. 20     The manner by which the parties held the Property as beneficial tenants in common was the presumed intention resulting trust. The parties held the Property on resulting trust for each other in their proportionate shares. In this case, it appeared that the parties would hold the Property entirely on trust for the plaintiff. The event which gave rise to the presumed intention resulting trust was precisely the presumption of such intention of the parties. If the defendant could rebut the presumption of such intention, then the resulting trust might not apply and she might be beneficially entitled to a joint tenancy in equity as was the case in law. 21     For\nthe sake of completeness, it should be mentioned that there is another\nspecies of resulting trust. This is what is known as the “automatic resulting\ntrust”, which arises where there is a transfer of property on express trusts,\nwhich declaration of trust does not exhaust the whole beneficial interest.\nIn other words, there is a failure of the express trust. The remaining\nbeneficial interest then results back to the settlor. This however, was\nnot relevant to the instant case and no more need be said about\nit. 22     The\ncommon understanding of the presumed intention resulting trust is\nthat such a trust arises when there is a voluntaryinter\nvivostransfer of property to a recipient, where the\nintention behind the transfer was unclear from the evidence. It\ncan also arise in a situation where the transferor, again with unclear\nintentions, voluntarily pays a third party to transfer rights to\nthe recipient. When such a situation obtains on the facts, a legal\npresumption invariably applies as to the transferor’s intention,\nthe result of which is that the recipient holds the property on\ntrust for the transferor. The subject of the trust is said to “result”\nback to the transferor, hence the name of the doctrine. The question\nas to what exactly is presumed as to the transferor’s intention\nis of some controversy amongst academics. William Swadling (supra[14])\nargues that what is presumed is the transferor’s intention to declare\na trust in his own favour (seeEnglish Private\nLawat 4.191), in contrast to Robert Chambers’ argument\nthat the presumption is that the transferor did not intend to benefit\nthe recipient (see Robert Chambers,Resulting\nTrusts(Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1997) at p 32). The\nconsequence of the difference of views lies in the different facts which\nneed to be proved in order to rebut the transferor’s presumed intention.\nThe reasons why this presumption of intention arises at all are tied\nto historical and sociological considerations, at the heart of which\nis the rather cynical view that “outside of certain relationships,\nan owner of property never intends to make a gift” (seeLau Siew Kimat[36]). 23     The\npresumption involved in this trust can be rebutted by invoking a counter-presumption\nknown as the presumption of advancement. This states that within\ncertain relationships, it is presumed that a voluntaryinter vivostransfer of property was indeed\nintended to be an outright transfer and intended to benefit the\nrecipient. The conventional relationships included only situations\nwhere a parent transfers property to his child, and where a husband\ntransfers property to his wife. If either of the relationships obtained\non the facts, then the presumption of advancement would operate such\nthat the transfer would be considered an outright gift and the subject of\nthe transfer would remain with the recipient. No resulting trust\nin favour of the transferor would be presumed. 24     There\nare two noteworthy points about the presumption of advancement.\nThe first is that it seems a little strange to consider this a “presumption”,\nsince all this “presumption” seems to achieve is to acknowledge\nthe stark nature of what has already happened: that a gratuitous\ntransfer had taken place from the transferor to the recipient. The second\nis that the relevant relationships reflect a somewhat patriarchal\nview of society, as was recognised inLau Siew\nKim(at[63]) in\nrelation to the parent-child relationship, and the court in that\ncase also recognised (at[60])\nthat the content of the presumption of advancement must be flexible to\nkeep pace with changing societal norms. The present case involves\na daughter and her mother, and it remains to be seen if there would\nbe cause to expand the presumption of advancement from parent-child\nand husband-wife, to daughter-mother relationships. 25     Notwithstanding\nthe theoretical tangles in this area of the law, what is uncontroversial\nis that such a trust is implied/imposed if there is a transfer of\nproperty from a transferor to a recipient, where the intention of\nmaking such transfer was unexplained. As the Court of Appeal pointed\nout inLau Siew Kim(at[59]), the two presumptions of resulting\ntrust and advancement should only operate when there is no evidence\nfrom which to prove or infer the intention of the transferor.",
        "Can the presumption of resulting\ntrust be rebutted by the operation of the rule of survivorship?": "26     In\nthis case, the conveyance of the Property was to the plaintiff and the\ndefendant in their joint names (since the daughter made all the contributions\nto the purchase price), which intention was unexplained. Therefore,\nthe presumption of resulting trust applied, and a resulting trust arose\nsuch that the parties held the Property on resulting trust for the plaintiff\nsolely. As the Court of Appeal clarified inLau\nSiew Kim(at[35]): There is an important distinction between\nthe presumption of resulting trust and the resulting trust itself.\nThe presumption is an inference of fact drawn from the existence\nof other facts, whereas the resulting trust is the equitable response\nto those facts, proved or presumed: see Robert Chambers,Resulting Trusts(Clarendon Press, Oxford,\n1997) at p 32 27     If\nthe defendant was to be beneficially entitled to a half share of\nthe sale proceeds as she claimed, she would have to demonstrate\nthat no resulting trust arose, and the parties held in equity as\nthey did in law. To do this, she would have to rebut the presumed\nfact relating to the intention of the parties that gave rise to\nthe resulting trust. William Swadling says that the fact presumed\nis the transferor’s intention to declare a trust in his own favour;\nand Robert Chambers says that it is the transferor’s intentionnotto benefit the recipient. It may not\nbe necessary to decide which of these two views is the correct one,\nsince we must first examine if the facts would support a rebuttal\nof either. Additionally, the presumption of advancement could also\napply to rebut the presumption of resulting trust. 28     On\nthe facts, the defendant alleged many facets of the same intention expressed\nby the plaintiff. These mainly had to do with the plaintiff’s expressions\nof her feelings toward her mother, and the plaintiff’s assurances that\nshe would take care of her mother for the rest of her mother’s life.\nThe defendant also expressed her own happiness at being able to\nrely on the plaintiff, her favourite daughter, whom she praised\nas being the most capable and successful of her children. That said,\nthe only intentions that we are concerned with here are the parties’\nintentions toward the acquisition of the Property. 29     One\nthing stood out, and could be said to be the pith of all the good intentions\nthat the parties had expressed. This was that the reason why the parties\nheld the Property in their joint names was due to the rule of survivorship\nbeing intended to apply so that the defendant would receive the\nProperty should the plaintiff predecease her. 30     The\ngist of the defendant’s contention was that the plaintiff had intended\nto care and provide for the defendant indefinitely. The Property was\nthus conveyed to the parties’ joint names so that if the plaintiff\nwere to die, the operation of the rule of survivorship would assure\nthe defendant of a roof over her head. In support of her claim,\nthe defendant pointed to a statement allegedly made by the plaintiff: ...at that time when I was named as the\nco-owner [of the Property] with her, the Plaintiff told me that\nshe was putting it in our joint names so that if anything were to\nhappen to her, I would get the Property as she was buying the Property\nfor us. The plaintiff did not deny that this was her intention, and\nstated (in her affidavit filed on 18 May 2010 para 38) that: Although all payments required for the\npurchase and maintenance of the Property were made by me, I decided\nto add the [d]efendant’s name to the title of the Property in case\nI passed on unexpectedly. At least if that were to happen, the [d]efendant\nwill[sic] have a roof over her head. But crucially, in the next sentence following, the plaintiff\nmade it clear that: For all intents and purposes, the [d]efendant\nand my 2 sisters knew that the Property was my property. The plaintiff also took pains (at para 13 of her AEIC) to\nstate: Given the [d]efendant’s irresponsible and\nirrepressible gambling ways, I will not agree to transfer or give\nany monies to the [d]efendant as she will simply blow it off. I\nmade a decision to only allow the [d]efendant’s name to be added\nto the title of the Property in case I passed on unexpectedly. At\nleast in that scenario, the [d]efendant can have a roof over her\nhead. I never intended for her to have any share in the Property\nunless I passed on before her. Whether or not the defendant was Actually an inveterate gambler\nwas not relevant but this statement of the plaintiff demonstrated,\nat least, her negative attitude towards making gifts to her mother. The plaintiff confirmed this on cross-examination when she\nsaid: ...I have never at any point in time told\nthe defendant or assure her in any forms or ways that she would\nhave any share or interest in the[sic] 55 Jalan Chengam. The only\npurpose of having her name there is for survivorship, that is in\nthe event that I pass on before her, she would get 100% of the property.\nWhen I’m still alive, which I am now, she will get nothing. She knows\nthat. 31     Interestingly,\nthe parties had held two other properties previously in their joint\nnames, and the reason for this manner of holding both properties was\nattributed to the rule of survivorship as well. In relation to the\nBishan flat, the defendant claimed that: 49 ...at the time of the transfer of the\nBishan HDB Flat[sic] to both our names the Plaintiff told me that\nsince the Bishan HDB flat was now held in our joint names, if anything\nwere to happen to her, the Bishan HDB flat will be considered as\nmine alone. 50 ...the Plaintiff would openly told [sic]\nthe twins that they should not worry about taking care of me and\nthat she would do so to the end of my days as she has all along\nbeen doing. 32     The\nplaintiff’s affidavits did not answer this point directly, but during her\ncross-examination by counsel for the defendant, Tan Siah Yong (“Mr Tan”),\nthe following evidence was recorded: Q:...when\nyour mother and you became the sole joint owners of the HDB flat\nin Bishan, did you tell your mother the same thing? A:Yes. Q:That if anything were to happen to\nyou, you pass on, it will go to her, you told her the same thing,\nright? A:Yes. 33     The\nsame appeared to be true of the Eden Grove property. The defendant\nstated: For this purchase which she said was meant\nas in[sic] investment she similarly told me that she has included\nme also as a joint tenant so that if anything happened to her, the\nEden Grove Property will belong to me. The plaintiff agreed during cross-examination: Q:And\nin this instance, when you bought the Eden Grove Condominium, you\nalso included you mother with you as a co-owner of the property---co-purchaser\nof the property, sorry. Is that right? A:Yes. ... Q:And\nthe joint tenancy was also explained to her. A:Yes. And she knew for a fact the reason\nwhy I put her name down is that in the event that I pass on before\nher, then she will get 100% of the property. 34     In\nrespect of the Bishan flat, the plaintiff pointed out that she had needed\nto include the defendant as co-owner in order to satisfy HDB’s regulations\nrequiring a family nucleus as a precondition to occupying public\nhousing. However, this consideration did not apply in respect of\nthe Eden Grove property. The plaintiff was at liberty to acquire\nthe Eden Grove property in her own name, and she admitted as much\nin cross-examination. 35     Returning\nto the issue of the Property, it was clear that both parties agreed\nthat the rule of survivorship was the reason why the Property was conveyed\ninto their joint names. The question remained as to whether as a matter\nof law that would suffice to rebut the presumption of resulting\ntrust. 36     The\nplaintiff relied on the case ofMariam Khatoon\nbte Rahim Khan v Mohamed Saleh[1999] SGHC 68 (“Mariam”) as authority for the proposition\nthat even if joint tenants held property because they intended that\nthe rule of survivorship should apply, this did not amount to an intention\nthat during their lifetimes, each co-owner should have a half share of\nthe property in equity.Mariamwas\na case which involved a property held in the joint names of a married\ncouple who had since divorced. The property in question was purchased\nduring the subsistence of the marriage, with the husband paying\napproximately 92% of the purchase price. After the parties divorced,\nthe wife applied to the court for a declaration that the property\nbelonged to the parties in equal shares, because they shared a common\nintention that the property should be shared equally. The husband inMariamdid not dispute that the parties\nhad intended for the rule of survivorship to apply, because he wanted\nto provide for her in the event of his own death, but he did dispute\nthe wife’s claim that the parties had intended the property to be\nheld beneficially in equal shares. It was clear that this case concerned\na common intention constructive trust, not a presumed resulting\ntrust as in the instant case. Yet, that was not a sufficient point\nof distinction to distinguishMariamfrom\nthe present case. The value ofMariamlay\nin the analysis of what implications the intended application of\nthe rule of survivorship had on the intentions of joint tenants. 37     The\nHigh Court inMariamrejected the\nwife’s application and held that the parties owned the property\nin unequal shares in proportion to their respective financial contributions\nto its acquisition. Crucial to the court’s determination was this\nholding: All [the wife] said was that [the husband]\nhad told [the lawyer] that in case of any event, the two of them\nshould be joint tenants and none of their property should be transferred\nto anyone else. To my mind, such a statement is not akin to saying\nthat the intention is that both parties should hold the property in\nequal shares. What it discloses is an intention that on the death\nof either party, the other should automatically obtain ownership\nof the whole property without anyone else being able to make a claim\nto it. 38     The\nparagraph quoted above speaks to the plain meaning of the rule of\nsurvivorship. This rule can be explained as a consequence of the\nconcept of a joint tenancy. A set of joint tenants collectively\nhold property as a group, and only as a group. None of them hold\nany rights on their own. Therefore, when one of the set dies, the\nnumber of tenants who collectively hold diminishes and the property\nwill be held by the remaining number of joint tenants, jointly.\nIf there were only two joint tenants, then upon the death of one,\nthe other would hold the tenancy solely. Since a joint tenant does\nnot hold any rights in the property on his own, he has nothing to bequeath\nto his successors in a will. The power of a joint tenancy is that\nit operates automatically to vest the tenancy in the surviving tenants,\nwithout the need for a subsequent conveyance from the personal representatives\nof the deceased (seeEnglish Private Lawat 4.355\nto 4.356). As mentioned above (at[14]),\nequity was not in favour of the rule of survivorship, viewing it\nas unfair to the estate of the deceased joint tenant that the surviving\njoint tenant should take the property absolutely. Notwithstanding\nthis, the rule of survivorship remained in law as a very powerful\ntool for property owners to achieve the ends they wished. 39     Therefore,\nthe most straightforward meaning of this rule is that if tenants\nintended it to apply, then the tenants intended that should one predecease\nthe other, the other would hold the property solely. The intended\nconsequences of the rule of survivorship operate after the death\nof one tenant, and say nothing whatsoever about what should happen\nwhile both tenants are alive. This is not to say that the rule of\nsurvivorship is incompatible with an intention that the joint tenants\nshould also hold the property beneficially during their lifetimes.\nWhat this means is that the rule of survivorship sheds no light\non the tenants’ intentions as to their beneficial interests in the\nproperty while both are alive. 40     Another\nway of explaining this was stated inLau Siew\nKim(at [105]) when the Court of Appeal stated that: We are of the view that the presumption\nof advancement could similarly operate with respect to onlypartof the interest in the property in\nquestion; it may be rebutted as to the life interest of a property\nbut prevail as to the remainder – one such case would be where a\nproperty is held on joint tenancy and it is inferred that there\nis an intention of the rule of survivorship to operate. [emphasis\noriginal] 41     The\ncourt inLau Siew Kimsaid this\nin the context of the operation of the presumption of advancement\nbetween spouses. In that case, the Court of Appeal extended the\npresumption to the extent that when married spouses purchase property\nas legal joint tenants, the court may infer an intention on the\npart of the contributing spouse that the rule of survivorship was\nmeant to operate. The basis for inferring this intention has its\nroots in the presumption of advancement as it operates between spouses. Again,\nthis is not a point of distinction that detracts from the application\nof the principle stated in the paragraph above, which is that the\nrule of survivorship only affects the remainder, and the parties\nmay intend something altogether quite different for the life interest. 42     The\nupshot of the discussion above is that the rule of survivorship tells\nus nothing about the parties’ intentions as to the Property in this\ncase. On Swadling’s view of the fact presumed in the presumed intention resulting\ntrust, the rule does not tell us that the plaintiff didnotwish to declare a trust in her own\nfavour; and on Chambers’ view of the presumed fact, the rule does\nnot tell us that the plaintiffdidintend\nto benefit the defendant so far as the life interest was concerned.\nThere was also no evidence of a more general intention that the\ndefendant should be entitled to a life interest. The defendant’s\nreliance on this rule therefore did not suffice to rebut the presumption\nof resulting trust, and the resulting trust remained. 43     This\nfinding is fortified by the fact that the parties had previously\nheld the Bishan flat and the Eden Grove property in their joint\nnames, and both agreed that on both occasions, the joint tenancy\nwas intended such that the rule of survivorship would operate. The\nplaintiff seemed to me to be keen to make provision for her mother\nboth during her own lifetime and beyond, but I was not convinced\nthat this extended to giving the defendant a beneficial half share\nin the Property as part of this provision.",
        "The presumption of advancement": "44     Although\nthe defendant did not rely on this explicitly, for completeness\nthe application of the presumption of advancement should also be\nconsidered. As stated above at[24],\nthe conventional view of this is that where a man transfers property\nto his wife or his child, the transfer is presumed to be an outright\ngift, and this would suffice to rebut the presumption of resulting\ntrust. The beauty of the presumption of advancement lay in its assistance\nin presuming the donative intent necessary for a gift. The conventional\nstatement relating to transfers to a child has been the subject\nof some criticism, and has been extended in Australia to apply to\ntransfers from a mother to her child (seeNelson\nv Nelson(1995) 184 CLR 538 at 576 and 601). The Court\nof Appeal inLau Siew Kiminobiterdicta(at[67]-[68])\napproved of a flexible and dynamic application of the presumption\nof advancement and appeared to sanction its application to transfers\nmade by either parent, male or female, to any of their children,\nwhether minors or adults. I note that the Court of Appeal was also\ncareful to state that thisobiter dictadid\nnot constitute the final word on the matter. 45     Here,\nwe have a situation where an adult child transferred property to her\nmother. This stretches the presumption in a way which is not entirely easy\nto accept, since the presumption appeared to be premised on a notion that\nit was for a parent to provide for his/her child. The question that\narose was, would the presumption apply to situations where it appeared\nthat the child was to provide for her parent? I was not inclined\nto answer the question without the benefit of full arguments but\ntwo points will be made. 46     The\nfirst is that the presumption was apparently based on the thought that\nin certain pre-existing relationships, the transferor was morally obliged,\nor naturally obliged, to provide for the recipient (see Robert Pearce, John\nStevens & Warren Barr,The Law of Trusts\nand Equitable Obligations(Oxford University Press, 5thEd,\n2010 at p 283). In fact, this was the basis on which the operation\nof the presumption as to a transfer from a mother to her child was\nrejected in nineteenth century England. Jessel M.R. inBennet v Bennet(1878-79) LR 10 Ch D 474\nat 478 stated that there was “no obligation according to the rules\nof equity – on a mother to provide for her child”. Interestingly,\nin Singapore, we have the Maintenance of Parents Act (Cap 167B,\n1996 Rev Ed), which obliges children to provide maintenance to either\nor both of their parents domiciled and resident in Singapore; should their\nparents be unable to maintain themselves and apply to court for\na maintenance order. Children in Singapore are therefore under a\nlegal obligation to provide for their parents. 47     The\nsecond point is that we should not confuse the child’s inclination to\nprovide for her parent with an intention to make a gift. As was\nthe case here, the plaintiff appeared minded to provide for her\nmother’s needs, but did not appear minded to give her mother a half\nshare in the Property.",
        "Proprietary estoppel": "48     The\ndefendant claimed in the alternative that she was entitled to relief on\nthe basis of proprietary estoppel. The defendant relied on the case\nofHong Leong Singapore Finance Ltd v United\nOverseas Bank[2007] 1 SLR(R) 292 (“Hong\nLeong”) (at [170])) which quoted Tan Sook Yee,Principles of Singapore LandLaw (Butterworths\nAsia, 2ndEd, 2001) (at pp 97-98), and\nstated the doctrine simply. Where there was a land owner who encouraged,\nor permitted a claimant to hold the belief that the claimant was\nentitled to some right or interest in the land, and the claimant in\nreliance on this belief Acted to his detriment, then the land owner\nwould be estopped from insisting on his strict legal rights where\nthose would be inconsistent with the claimant’s belief. 49     It\nshould be noted that the exact definition of the doctrine is of\nsome dispute, as are the requirements that must be satisfied to\nconstitute the individual components of the doctrine. In any event,\nit must be emphasised that the doctrine is founded on the unconscionability\nof the landowner’s Actions. Sundaresh Menon JC inHong\nLeong(at [171]) quoted Lord Denning inCrabb\nv Arun DC[1976] Ch 179 who stated (at 187-188): The basis of this proprietary estoppel\n– as indeed of promissory estoppel – is the interposition of equity.\nEquity comes in, true to form, to mitigate the rigours of strict\nlaw... it will prevent a person from insisting on his strict legal rights\n– whether arising under a contract or on his title deeds or by statute\n– when it would be inequitable for him to do, having regard to the\ndealings which have taken place between the parties. Furthermore, unconscionability is the essence of the inquiry\nand the requirements stated above are directed at establishing that unconscionability,\n(see Sundaresh Menon JC inHong Leongat\n[191]): ...I do not think it is correct to approach\nthe requirement of unconscionability as a separate element. On the\ncontrary, it is the overarching inquiry. The court will only be\nmoved to raise the estoppel if it is satisfied that it would be\nunconscionable not to do so. This was also stated earlier by Robert Walker LJ inGillett v Holt[2000] 3 WLR 815 (at 829)\n(a case not cited by either party): ...the doctrine of proprietary estoppel\ncannot be treated as subdivided into three or four watertight compartments...the\nquality of the relevant assurances may influence the issue of reliance,\nthat reliance and detriment are often intertwined... Moreover, the\nfundamental principle that equity is concerned to prevent unconscionable\nconduct permeates all the elements of the doctrine. In the end the\ncourt must look at the matter in the round. 50     In\nanother English case (also not cited by the parties)Cobbe v Yeoman’s Row Management[2008]\n1 WLR 1752 (“Cobbe”), Lord Walker reiterated\nthis (at 1788): ...[unconscionability] does in my opinion\nplay a very important part in the doctrine of equitable estoppel,\nin unifying and confirming, as it were, the other elements. If the\nother elements appear to be present but the result does not shock\nthe conscience of the court, the analysis needs to be looked at again. It is because the landowner Acted in some unconscionable manner\nthat he is estopped from denying the claimant’s claim. This emphasis\non the landowner’s unconscionability must be so, because proprietary\nestoppel creates property rights in the claimant where there were\nnone, and destroys existing property rights in the landowner. 51     The\ninquiry into proprietary estoppel logically follows the inquiry into\nthe presumed intention resulting trust. It was only because of the findings\nthat led to the understanding that the plaintiff held the entire Property\nbeneficially, that it makes sense to regard her as a landowner who could\nallegedly make representations to the defendant that gave rise to\nthe defendant’s alleged beliefs and detrimental reliance. 52     The\ndefendant relied on the following facts to support her claim in proprietary\nestoppel. The plaintiff had made certain representations to her which\nincluded that the plaintiff would take care of the defendant and\nthat the defendant “need not worry about having a roof over her\nhead”. The defendant, in reliance on these representations, agreed\nto sell the Bishan flat and move into the Property with the plaintiff.\nThe main detriment suffered by the defendant lay in her agreeing\nto sell the Bishan flat, because now that she had been evicted from\nthe Property, she had nowhere to live and no roof over her head.\nThe defendant also complained that she had been subject to “house\nrules” while living in the Property, which rules were imposed by\nthe plaintiff and had not fettered the defendant in the Bishan flat;\nthe plaintiff had reduced the defendant’s regular monthly allowance\nof $1,000 to an unspecified amount (the plaintiff had to use this\nmoney to pay for the upkeep of the Property). 53     Therefore\nthe defendant’s counsel submitted that the plaintiff should be estopped\nfrom asserting her claim to be the sole beneficial owner of the Property,\nand the defendant had an equity that should be satisfied by this court.\nMr Tan left the defendant’s remedy to the discretion of the court\nbut suggested that her alleged equity could be satisfied by ordering\nthe plaintiff to pay the defendant a monthly sum equivalent to the\ndefendant’s cost of renting suitable accommodation for herself. 54     I\nshould point out that the representations must be in relation to\nthe defendant receiving some interest in land, in order to distinguish\nthis from promissory estoppel which is incapable of constituting\nan independent cause of Action, and must also be clear and unequivocal.\nBut the assessment of what is clear and unequivocal must be conducted\nfrom the claimant’s point of view. This question is an objective\none considered in the particular context of the case, and asks what\nthe reasonable meaning of the representations made by the landowner\nto the claimant were, from the claimant’s viewpoint. 55     In\nthe recent English case ofThorner v Major[2009]\n1 WLR 776 (“Thorner”), the House\nof Lords considered the traditional formulation that the representation\nmust be “clear and unequivocal”, and reformulated this question\nin several ways, all of which could be distilled to the same principle.Thornerconcerned two reticent farmers,\none of whom was the landowner who had made oblique remarks to the\nother, the claimant, about inheriting the farm they worked on. Lord Hoffmann\nstated (at 779) that: The question was whether [the landowner’s]\nwords and Acts would reasonably have conveyed to [the claimant]\nan assurance that he would [inherit]. This was echoed by Lord Rodger who stated (at 786) that: I would hold that it is sufficient if what\n[the landowner] said was “clear enough”. To whom? Perhaps not to\nan outsider. What matters, however, is that what [the landowner]\nsaid should have been clear enough for [the claimant], whom he was\naddressing and who had years of experience in interpreting what\nhe said and did, to form a reasonable view that [the landowner]\nwas giving him an assurance that he was to inherit the farm and that\nhe could rely on it. Similar opinions, that the court could determine the reasonable\nmeaning of the landowner’s representations from the claimant’s point\nof view, were expressed in the speeches of the other Law Lords.",
        "The plaintiff’s representations": "56     Returning\nto the facts of this case, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff\nhad made several representations with regard to the Property. These\nwere made during the period of their joint ownership of the Bishan flat\nand in the lead up to the purchase of the Property, although the defendant\ncould point to no specific instances of when the plaintiff had made\nsuch assurances: 1....I have relied on what the Plaintiff\nhas[sic] said to me over the period of our joint ownership of the\nBishan HDB flat and further when she was bent on buying the Property\ntelling me that it was to come to me if anything were to happened[sic]\nto me and also that she will take care of me for the rest of my days. 2. ...I had agreed to her suggestion and\nher decision to sell the Bishan HDB Flat because of her declared\nintention to house me including her twin sisters in the Property\nand but for that I would not have agreed otherwise to the sale of\nthe Bishan HDB Flat. 57     The\ndefendant in her first affidavit also pointed to other occasions, before\nthe Property was bought, on which the plaintiff had made certain representations.\nThe first quote related to the Bishan flat, and the second quote\nrelated to the Eden Grove property: [the plaintiff] told me that since the\nBishan flat was now in our joint names only, if anything were to\nhappen to her, the Bishan flat will be considered as mine alone.\nShe told me this to assure me that she will always take care of\nme which she has done throughout. ... In or around May 2005, Michelle bought\na condominium...She similarly told me that she has put me in as\na joint tenant so that if anything happened to her, the condominium\nwill[sic] belong to me. When I hear her say and do these things,\nit made me very happy as I could see that she was always thinking\nof providing for me. Her assurances of taking care of me were matched\nby her deeds. 58     At\nthis juncture I should point out that I found the defendant’s testimony\nin court difficult to believe let alone accept – unlike the plaintiff,\nI was not impressed with her as a witness. Her other daughters did\nnot testify to corroborate the defendant’s evidence even though\nher eldest daughter (Neo Ling Ling) and one of the twins (Neo Hui\nPing) had filed affidavits on her behalf. (One of the twins apparently\nsat in court throughout the hearing). I formed the distinct impression\nthat the defendant had embellished her story, adding in tales about\nhow: (i) her eldest daughter’s husband was supposed to be the purchaser\nof the Property initially but passed the option to the plaintiff\nat the defendant’s/latter’s request; (ii) that the plaintiff had\nallegedly promised to give her 50% of the sale proceeds of the Property;\n(iii) the plaintiff promised to buy her two condominiums if the\nProperty was sold and give her and the twins $50,000 each from the\nsale proceeds. I did not believe that the plaintiff had made any\nsuch promises. The defendant also came across as a frivolous person.\nDespite not pursuing Civil Appeal No 142 of 2010 and being advised\nby the court on 11 January 2011 that her appeal was deemed to be\nwithdrawn, she made no efforts to find alternative accommodation.\nNotwithstanding her supposed impecuniosity, the defendant continued\nto spend substantial sums purchasing beauty supplements even as\nlate as 7 February 2011, which was nine days before the writ of\npossession was executed by the Sheriff on 16 February 2011. I disbelieved\nthe defendant’s claim that she was purchasing the products on her\nother daughters’ behalf. 59     The\nplaintiff on her part disagreed that she had given any such assurances\nand claimed that what she had said to her mother was far narrower.\nThe first quote, contained in her AEIC, was in relation to the Property\nand the second, extracted upon cross-examination, was in relation to\nthe Bishan flat: During the [d]efendant’s birthday dinner\nmeal on 5 June 2007, I announced my plans to purchase a landed property\nand to explore the possibility of having the [d]efendant, my twin\nsisters, my fiancé, Keith Anthony Lazaroo and I living under the\nsame household. ... Q:So\nyou would agree with me that the Bishan property was to provide\na roof as a family home for the purpose of housing your mother right? A:The Bishan flat was a place that she\ncan--- that she can stay and has been staying. Q:And this is in line with what you have\nbeen saying to her...that she need not worry about a roof over her\nhead because this is her house that’s housed her. A:No, I told her that she need not worry\nabout having no place to stay, she can always come and stay with\nme or be with me if I have enough space or wherever I am, whatever\nI do, yah. Q:Would you not agree with me that what\nyou have stated in those words reassured her as to the fact that\nshe need not worry about having a roof over her head? A:I cannot control her perception. 60     The\ndefendant, the plaintiff’s three sisters and the plaintiff’s then fiancé\nMr Lazaroo, were all present at the birthday dinner. However, only Mr Lazaroo\nwas called to testify, and his evidence was that the discussion\nat the dinner was conducted in Mandarin which he did not understand, although\nthe plaintiff explained to him after the dinner that she had indicated\nher intention to buy a property to “house everybody” and set out the\nconditions of living together. 61     It\nwas clear that there was no consensus between the parties as to\nwhat the plaintiff had represented to the defendant, and Mr Lazaroo’s\nevidence as to the events of the birthday dinner in 2007 was inconclusive.\nThe defendant’s case, taken at its highest, would suggest that the\nplaintiff had represented that the plaintiff would take care of\nthe defendant for the rest of the defendant’s life, and that those\nassurances were supported by the plaintiff’s Actions in purchasing\nthe Bishan flat, the Eden Grove property, and the Property in their\njoint names. The plaintiff however, maintained that she had merely\ntold the defendant that the defendant could come and stay with her\nwhenever she wished. 62     I\nfound it likely that the plaintiff’s representations to the defendant\nin relation to the Property were probably along the lines of the\nplaintiff assuring the defendant that the defendant need not worry\nabout not having a place to live for the foreseeable future. 63     The\ncontext in which the representations should be assessed has to be considered.\nThe defendant was not well educated and was financially dependent\non the plaintiff and her other daughters. At the point just before the\ndefendant agreed to sell the Bishan flat, the plaintiff had previously purchased\nthree properties in the parties’ joint namesviz,\nthe Bishan flat, the Eden Grove property and the Property. The plaintiff\nhad also previously assured the defendant that the defendant need\nnot worry about accommodation. The representations considered for\nthe proprietary estoppel were solely those that related to the Property.\nHowever, the plaintiff’s other representations regarding the Bishan\nflat and the Eden Grove property were taken into account as part\nof the context in which the first set of representations was assessed. 64     The\nEden Grove property in particular was interesting, because in contrast\nto the Bishan flat and the Property at which the parties had resided, the\nEden Grove property was acquired purely for investment purposes.\nThis might have encouraged the defendant somewhat, because it suggested\nthat the plaintiff wanted to give her something more than just a\nplace to stay. At the time the Eden Grove property was bought, the\nparties contemporaneously held and lived at the Bishan flat. Thus,\nif the plaintiff predeceased the defendant, both properties would\nhave passed to the defendant who would not only have a roof over\nher head but also another place from which to generate rental income.\nHowever, as discussed above (especially at[31])\nthe plaintiff’s intention was that the properties would only pass\nto her mother upon her demise, and the defendant was not to receive\nany share before that. The defendant was aware of this distinction, as\nshe herself stated in her AEIC (para 5.5): For this purchase which she said was meant\nas in[sic] investment she similarly told me that she has included\nme also as a joint tenant so that if anything happened to her, the\nEden Grove Property will belong to me. The defendant understood that it was only if anything untoward\nhappened to the plaintiff, that the Eden Grove property would belong\nto the defendant. Similarly, in relation to the Bishan flat, the\ndefendant’s evidence showed that she was also able to grasp the\nconditional nature of the statement the plaintiff had made to her\n(see[32]above). In such\na case, it is difficult to accept that the defendant truly held\nthe belief that she should be entitled to any share of the Bishan\nflat or Eden Grove property in her lifetime. 65     In\nany event, the defendant’s own characterisation of the plaintiff’s statements\nsuggested that the extent of her belief was that the plaintiff would\nprovide housing for her and did not extend to a belief that she\nwas entitled to a beneficial share in the Property. This is supported\nby the fact that even though the defendant stated that the plaintiff\nhad “backed up” her assurances by her “actions” in purchasing the\nproperties in their joint names, the defendant never asserted a\nright over the sales proceeds of the Bishan flat and the Eden Grove\npropertybeforethe plaintiff brought\nthis Action. The defendant only made such a claim belatedly, and\nin my view, disingenuously. 66     I\nconcluded therefore that the plaintiff’s representations to the defendant\nrelated to the defendant not having to worry about accommodation\nfor the foreseeable future, and it was probably reasonable for this\nparticular defendant to interpret that as meaning that the plaintiff would\nbe the one to provide her with accommodation. This however, did not\nnecessarily extend to it being reasonable for the defendant to interpret the\nrepresentations as meaning that she would have a right to accommodation\nin a particular property. In fact, the defendant’s own narration\nof the plaintiff’s representations lacked that specificity. It was\nalso not reasonable for the defendant to interpret this as meaning\nthat she would be entitled to any beneficial share of any property\nlet alone the Property, and this was in fact borne out by the defendant’s\nown ability to understand the operation of the rule of survivorship. 67     In\nsummary, the most that was reasonable for the defendant to interpret\nof the plaintiff’s representations was that the plaintiff would provide\nher with accommodation for the foreseeable future. In fact, the defendant’s\nbelief only extended that far, since her retelling of the plaintiff’s representations\ndid not specify that the accommodation provided would be in the\nProperty, and the defendant understood the implications of the rule of\nsurvivorship. In this light, the defendant would not be beneficially entitled\nto the sale proceeds of the Property on the ground of proprietary estoppel. 68     The\nremaining question to be addressed was whether the defendant had\nan equity that would entitle her to a monthly payment from the plaintiff\nfor the cost of accommodation, given her belief that she was entitled\nto accommodation from the plaintiff. This question really fell more in\nthe realm of promissory estoppel, which would not operate as a cause\nof Action. However, to fortify the conclusion on proprietary estoppel\nit would be appropriate to consider the other requirements of detriment,\nreliance and the overarching question of unconscionability. 69     The\nnext stage of the inquiry therefore turned on whether the defendant\nhad relied on this belief to her detriment.",
        "Detrimental reliance": "70     The\nrequirement of reliance is similar to the concept of causation and asks\nwhether the defendant Acted in the belief that she was entitled\nto a right of accommodation. I accept that this requirement was\nsatisfied when the defendant agreed to sell the Bishan flat. 71     As\nfor whether the defendant suffered detriment consequential on this\nreliance, the answer is a little more doubtful. The scope of detriment\nis very wide and as stated by Walker LJ (see[48])\ninGillett v Holt(at 836): The detriment need not consist of the expenditure\nof money or other quantifiable financial detriment, so long as it\nis something substantial. The requirement must be approached as\npart of a broad inquiry as to whether repudiation of an assurance\nis or is not unconscionable in all the circumstances. 72     The\ndefendant claimed that she had suffered three kinds of detriment. The\nfirst was that she had nowhere to live after the eviction from the Property,\nthe second was that she was subject to “house rules”, and the third was\nthe loss of her monthly allowance. Only the first is of any consequence. The\n“house rules” were a form of domestic protocol laid down by the plaintiff\nto ensure harmonious living in the Property which housed her mother,\nthe twins and later her fiancé/husband. Clearly the “house rules” were\nof limited efficacy, but in any event they cannot be considered\na detriment because they were an incidence of domestic living and\nnot related to the defendant’s reliance in selling the Bishan flat.\nThe loss of the defendant’s monthly allowance was also not related\nto her reliance. 73     Therefore,\nthe question to be considered was really whether the defendant had\nsuffered a detriment by agreeing to sell the Bishan flat and having\nno place to stay. While the consequence sounded drastic, the more important\nquestion this court had to decide was how the consequence of the\ndefendant having no place to stay was a detriment related to her\nselling the Bishan flat in reliance on the plaintiff’s representation. 74     The\ndefendant apparently had no place to stay because the plaintiff applied\nto sell the Property and evict the defendant, which was granted. Counsel\nfor the plaintiff (Lisa Sam) had submitted that the defendant had not\nsuffered any detriment because even if she had insisted on retaining\nthe Bishan flat, she would not have had the financial capability\nto do so in any event. This submission suggested that even if the\ndefendant had not Acted in reliance, her current position would\nbe no better or no worse than what it was at the date of the hearing.\nI am not entirely satisfied that the inquiry into the defendant’s\ndetriment should take this form. This would compare the defendant’s\nhypothetical present day situation, had she not relied on, with\nthe defendant’s Actual present situation, after reliance. This seemed\na little too speculative an inquiry, since we would never know if\nthe defendant could have reconveyed the Bishan flat into the names\nof herself and one of her other daughters, and somehow serviced\nthe mortgage on the Bishan flat on her own with contributions from\nboth or one of the twins. I found it puzzling that she did not in\nfact embark on this sensible course of Action, but given that it\ndid not happen, it would be pointless to speculate on whether it\nwould have eventuated or not. 75     Further,\nthis method of comparison did not square with previous authorities\non proprietary estoppel. In the English case ofGreasley\nv Cooke[1980] 1 WLR 1306, the claimant, a domestic helper,\ncared for the landowner and his family for many years for no or\nvery little pay. InIn re Basham[1986]\n1 WLR 1498, the claimant worked unpaid for the landowner for many\nyears and refused an opportunity to move elsewhere. InGillett v Holt, the claimant gave up the\nopportunity for further education and career development to work\nfor the landowner. Closer examination of these decisions reveals\nthat they did not anticipate what distinction the claimants might\nhave achieved had they not suffered the detriment they did, but\nrather asked what kinds of opportunities and potential those claimants\nhad sacrificed. 76     The\npreferred inquiry would thus concentrate on the defendant’s position\nas it was before she relied on her belief, and juxtapose that with\nher position consequential on that reliance. Before her reliance,\nthe defendant had a joint tenancy with the plaintiff in the Bishan\nflat. The defendant had contributed a small amount of about $2,500\ntowards the purchase price of the Bishan flat and $870.78 from her\nCPF account; the flat was valued at around $360,000. It was also\nestablished that the intention of the parties in conveying the Bishan\nflat into their joint names was for the rule of survivorship to\napply (see[31]above). Under\nthose circumstances, it could not be said that the defendant’s purported\nrights against the plaintiff in relation to the Bishan flat, whether\nto accommodation or to the sale proceeds, were any more secure or\nguaranteed than in relation to the Property. Had the parties quarrelled\nwhile living in the Bishan flat and had the plaintiff similarly\napplied to sever the joint tenancy and evict the defendant, the\ndefendant would only be entitled to a very small amount of the sale\nproceeds on the presumed intention resulting trust analysis conducted\nearlier. 77     The\nparagraph above might on the face of it seem to similarly be a speculative\ninquiry. But this was not so for the reason that it was necessary to\ntest the strength of the defendant’s position before her reliance.\nThe analysis did not speculate on whether the plaintiff would have\nevicted the defendant or not, but rather considered the consequences\nif this happened. It did not make sense to acknowledge that the\ndefendant held a joint tenancy of the Bishan flat without examining\nits implications. 78     So,\nwhat opportunities and potential had the defendant sacrificed? The\nanswer appeared to be none or very little since her position in\nrelation to the Bishan flat was no different to her position in\nrelation to the Property. Had the defendant suffered any other sort\nof detriment beyond loss of the opportunity to retain the Bishan\nflat and live in it? The answer again seemed to be “no”, because\nthe defendant did not suffer any financial loss from the sale of\nthe Bishan flat. Her contributions to the purchase price were refunded\nin full. 79     The\nrequirement that the defendant show that she had suffered detriment\nis very closely related to the inquiry into the plaintiff’s unconscionability.\nIn large part, it is because a claimant suffered or would suffer\ndetriment that would make it unconscionable for a landowner to insist\non his strict legal rights. Proprietary estoppel seeks to avoid\ndetriment to the claimant by compelling the landowner to Act in\naccordance with the belief on which the claimant had Acted (seeGillett v Holt[at 836]). 80     The\ninquiry then shifts to the unconscionability of the plaintiff. This\nis a broad inquiry answered after surveying the initial conclusions\non the different requirements of representations, reliance and detriment,\nand assessing if those contributed to a finding of unconscionability.\nIt should be stressed that the initial conclusions are not conclusive\nof the question of unconscionability, and the degrees to which the\nindividual requirements are satisfied do not necessarily lead to\na similar degree of unconscionability. After all, the question of\nunconscionability must be looked at in the round. 81     What\nof the fact that the defendant apparently had no place to live after\nbeing evicted from the Property by the plaintiff, and what of the defendant’s\nbelief that she could rely on the plaintiff to provide her with accommodation?\nOn the face of it, those questions seemed to cast the plaintiff\nin a negative light. However, one incident in particular convinced me\nthat this was not so, and that the plaintiff had not Acted in an unconscionable\nmanner. 82     After\nthe court order that the Property should be sold was granted, the\nplaintiff made an offer through her lawyers on 3 September 2010\nto the defendant to house the defendant in a flat in Ang Mo Kio,\nwhich flat was apparently furnished and located in a convenient\narea. This arrangement was to the exclusion of the twins, whom the\nplaintiff viewed as being able to, and should support themselves.\nThe plaintiff offered to pay for the advance rental and sought contribution\nfrom her siblings to cover the future rent. However, the defendant\nrejected this offer. The timing of the offer may be of some interest,\nsince it came after the plaintiff applied to sell the Property but\nbefore the plaintiff applied for the entire sales proceeds to be\nreleased to her and whilst the defendant was still in occupation\nof the Property. A more cynical view of the plaintiff’s offer would\nbe that it was meant to tempt the defendant out of the Property.\nTherefore, the offer was one which could properly be considered\nas part of the plaintiff’s behaviourbeforeshe\nasserted her legal rights, and not as an after-the-event remedial measure.\nAs stated previously, the extent to which it was reasonable for\nthe defendant to believe in the plaintiff’s representations was\nthat the plaintiff would provide accommodation for the defendant.\nGiven that the alternative accommodation was offered by the plaintiff\nwithout any request from the defendant, it appeared that the plaintiff\nwas indeed Acting in accordance with the defendant’s reasonable\nbelief that the plaintiff would provide her with housing. It could\nnot be said that the plaintiff was Acting unconscionably, whether\nin this particular incident or the entire matter looked at in the\nround. The defendant’s rejection of this offer militated against\nthe satisfaction of any equity which she claimed to have.",
        "Conclusion": "83     For\nthe various reasons set out above, I dismissed the defendant’s claim\nto half the sale proceeds of the Property and also her claim to\nan equity in the same on the basis of proprietary estoppel. I directed\nthat the sum held by the plaintiff’s solicitors as stakeholders\nwas to be released forthwith to the plaintiff. Further, costs were\nawarded to the plaintiff on a standard basis but only up to 12 May\n2011 as legal aid to the defendant commenced on 13 May 2011."
