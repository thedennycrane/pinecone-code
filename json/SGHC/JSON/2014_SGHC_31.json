        "Background": "",
        "The appellant": "3       The\nappellant is 35 years old. He was unemployed when he committed the\npresent offences. His parents divorced when he was seven years old\nand he lived with his mother and sister until he was sent to the Singapore\nBoys Home in 1992. The appellant had a long history of antecedents.\nShortly before the commission of the present offences, he completed\na ten-year sentence of corrective training for house-breaking and\ntheft and was released from prison on 26 September 2012.",
        "The charges": "4       On\n14 June 2013, the appellant pleaded guilty to one charge of house-breaking\n(DAC No 39172 of 2012) under s 454 Penal Code, for breaking into\nand entering a dwelling unit on 8 October 2012 at about 2.00pm in order\nto commit theft of S$1,900 in cash and about S$1,000 in foreign currency.\nAs an offender with a previous conviction under s 454 Penal Code,\nthe appellant was additionally liable to be punished under s 458A Penal\nCode, which prescribes a mandatory sentence of caning: Punishment\nfor subsequent offence under section 454 or 457 458A.Whoever, having been\nconvicted of an offence under section 454, 455, 457 or 458, commits\nan offence under section 454 or 457 shall be punished with caning\nin addition to the punishment prescribed for that offence. 5       According\nto the Statement of Facts, which the appellant admitted without\nqualification, the stolen items were not recovered as the appellant had\nspent all the money. 6       The\nappellant also consented to two other charges being taken into consideration\nfor the purposes of sentencing: (a)     one\ncharge of house-breaking under s 454 read with s 458A Penal Code\n(DAC No 37985 of 2012) for the theft of goods with a total value\nof S$1,820 from a flat on 11 October 2012; and (b)     one\ncharge of attempted house-breaking under s 454 read with s 511 (DAC\nNo 39171 of 2012) for an attempt to enter a dwelling unit in order\nto commit theft on 11 October 2012. 7       The\nthree offences were committed over the course of four days. The first\nof these occurred less than two weeks after his release from prison following\nthe completion of a ten-year sentence of corrective training.",
        "The psychiatric reports": "8       Two\npsychiatric reports were presented before the DJ for the purpose of\nsentencing. The Prosecution submitted a report dated 5 November\n2012 from Dr Jerome Goh Hern Yee (“Dr Goh”) from the Institute of\nMental Health (“IMH”). Counsel for the appellant submitted a psychiatric\nreport dated 20 June 2013 from Dr Lionel Lim Chee Chong (“Dr Lim”)\nof L P Clinic Pte Ltd, who was in private practice. The IMH report 9       The\nappellant was remanded at the IMH from 19 October 2012 to 5 November\n2012 following his arrest for the above offences. Dr Goh examined\nthe appellant on three occasions on 23 October 2012, 31 October 2012\nand 2 November 2012. In addition, Dr Goh relied on the following sources\nof information to prepare his report: (a)     an\ninterview with the appellant’s father on 30 October 2012; (b)     documented\nobservations by IMH nursing staff during his remand; (c)     a\nreport on the appellant prepared by IMH’s Medical Social Worker; (d)     the\nappellant’s IMH clinical notes; (e)     the\ncharge sheets; and (f)     the\nreport and summary of facts prepared by the investigating officer. 10     In\nhis report, Dr Goh noted the appellant’s claims that he had started hearing\n“voices” upon his recent release from prison and that the “voices” were\ninside his head, telling him that he would not get caught. However, these\nvoices did not specifically instruct him to do anything in particular\nor to commit the house-breaking offences. The appellant also said\nthat he did not hear the “voices” when he committed the offences.\nThe appellant also claimed that house-breaking was to him “just\na game”; that he “just enjoyed it” and that he felt very happy when\nhe was committing house-breaking. Finally, the appellant also said\nthat he kept thinking about house-breaking and could not stop himself\nonce he started house-breaking. 11     Dr\nGoh diagnosed the appellant with an antisocial personality disorder,\nbut concluded that the appellant was not suffering from a mental illness.\nDr Goh thought that the “voices” described by the appellant were not\nconsistent with auditory hallucinations of a psychotic nature. He further\nopined that the appellant was not of unsound mind at the time of the\nalleged offences and was fit to plead in court. Dr Lim’s report 12     The\nappellant was interviewed by Dr Lim on 21 March 2013. In addition\nto this interview, Dr Lim also relied on other sources of information,\nincluding the following, to prepare his report: (a)     interviews\nwith the appellant’s father, sister and long-time pen friend; (b)     the\ncharge sheets; (c)     the\nIMH psychiatric report; and (d)     the\nPrison medical report dated 8 May 2013. 13     The\nappellant was recorded as informing Dr Lim that he started to experience\nan urge to break into houses two days after his release from prison\nand that he finally yielded to these impulses on 8 October 2012.\nThe appellant also claimed that he felt “very excited” when committing\nhouse-breaking and described the urge as akin to an addiction. He\nsaid that he would experience a sense of great relief and a release\nof inner tension once he had committed a house-breaking offence.\nThe appellant also told Dr Lim that he had thrown away the items\nthat he had stolen, including a laptop, a handphone and a walkman. 14     Dr\nLim concluded that the appellant was suffering from kleptomania, a\npsychiatric disorder. I set out the more significant extracts from\nhis report as follows: 1.Chun\nHian suffers from Kleptomania, an Impulse-Control Disorder. This\ndisorder may be associated with compulsive behaviour. … … 3.Chun\nHian’s psychological disorder was previously undiagnosed. His psychological\ncondition started some years back and he continued to experience\nthese symptoms during his imprisonment. The symptoms probably contributed\nto his insomnia. … 5.The\npsychiatric medication that he received from the prison psychiatrists\nwas not consistent with a diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder.\nAs stated previously, he was on one antipsychotic, one anti-itch/anti-anxiety\nand two antidepressant medication. Indeed, if Chun Hian has antisocial\npersonality disorder and does not have a mental illness …, then\nit is difficult to understand why treatment was given to him during\nand after his imprisonment. 6.The medication that he received in\nprison unwittingly treated the symptoms of Impulse-Control Disorder.\nThis probably explained for the recurrence of his compulsive house\nbreaking behaviour when he erroneously stopped the treatment after\nhis release from prison. … 15     Relying\non Dr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania, counsel for the appellant\nurged the DJ to impose a short custodial sentence to enable the appellant\nto receive treatment for his medical disorder. 16     In\nresponse, the Prosecution submitted that this was not appropriate given\nthe different diagnoses put forward by the psychiatrists. The Prosecution\nobserved that there were some discrepancies in the version of events\ngiven by the appellant to each psychiatrist and submitted that the police\nstatement which was given by the appellant four days after the commission\nof the offence should be given more weight than what he told Dr\nLim months after the offence. The Prosecution also submitted that contrary\nto the first of the five diagnostic criteria for kleptomania stated\nin theDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of\nMental Disorders(American Psychiatric Association, text\nrevision, 2000) (“the DSM-IV-TR”), the Accused had stolen items\nof value.",
        "The corrective training report": "17     The\nDJ called for a pre-sentencing report for corrective training (“the CT\nReport”) in view of the appellant’s multiple antecedents. Both psychiatric\nreports were made available for the purposes of preparing the CT\nReport. 18     The\nCT Report consisted of a Medical Officer’s Memorandum dated 13 July\n2013 and a Pre-Sentencing Report dated 29 July 2013. The former stated\nthat the appellant was fit at the time of the examination to undergo corrective\ntraining and certified him to be suffering from “mood disorder, insomnia\nand eczema since 2012 at least.” The latter stated that the appellant\nwas fit to undergo corrective training and assessed the appellant’s risk\nof re-offending in the category of high risk/need of criminal offending, with\na = 62% probability of recidivism within two years of release.",
        "The decision below": "19     The\nDJ accepted that in principle, the element of general deterrence could\nbe given considerably less weight where an offender suffered from\na mental illness that contributed to the commission of the offence.\nHowever, the DJ noted that this would depend on whether there was\na causal link between the illness and the offence, as well as the\nseriousness of the mental condition, the likelihood of re-offending\nand the severity of the crime (at [17] of the DJ’s Grounds of Decision\n(“GD”)). The DJ noted the different diagnoses in the reports of\nDr Goh and Dr Lim and appeared to have come to the conclusion that\nas the appellant did not satisfy one of the five diagnostic criteria\nfor kleptomania that were noted in Dr Lim’s report, namely, the\ntheft of items that were unnecessary for personal use or that were\nof no monetary value, Dr Lim’s report would be accorded less weight (at\n[18] of the GD). The DJ also observed that neither report indicated\nany causal link between the appellant’s alleged mental disorder\nand the offence (at [18] of the GD). 20     The\nDJ also noted that the appellant had a long history of property-related\nantecedents, primarily house-breaking offences, and had committed the\npresent offences within days of his release from prison. In the circumstances,\nthe DJ rejected counsel’s submissions that the appellant had acted\nout of character, and considered that a short custodial sentence\nwould be inappropriate (at [19] of the GD). 21     In\nthe light of the CT Report which indicated the appellant’s high\nrisk of recidivism and his fitness for corrective training, the\nDJ was satisfied that it was expedient with a view to the appellant’s\nreformation that he should receive a sentence of corrective training\nfor a substantial period of time and imposed a sentence of 12 years’\ncorrective training and six strokes of the cane (at [20] of the\nGD).",
        "The appeal": "22     The\nparties initially appeared before me on 3 October 2013. Two aspects\nof the case troubled me at that time. 23     First,\nthere were two conflicting psychiatric reports concerning the appellant’s\nmental condition before the court. The Prosecution took issue with\nDr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania. Yet neither doctor responsible\nfor these reports had been cross-examined. Moreover, the CT Report\nindicated a third diagnosis of mood disorder which was not elaborated\nupon. In the light of this, a question arose as to whether a Newton\nhearing should be called to determine whether the appellant indeed\nsuffered from kleptomania (or any other mental condition). 24     A\nNewton hearing is called when a fact is contested and it is material to\nsentencing. In such circumstances, the court will hear evidence\nand then make a finding:R v Robert John Newton(1982)\n4 Cr App R(S) 388. I recognise that a Newton hearing is the exception\nrather than the norm and should not ordinarily be convened unless\nthe court is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in order to\nresolve a difficult question of fact that is material to the court’s\ndetermination of the appropriate sentence: seeR\nv Kevin John Underwood[2005] 1 Cr App R(S) 90 (“Underwood”) (at [10(e)]), adopted inPP v Soh Song Soon[2010] 1 SLR 857 (at\n[3]–[4]). Undoubtedly, the sentencing judge has a discretion to\ndecline to hear such evidence if he is satisfied that the case advanced\non the defendant’s behalf is, with good reason, to be regarded as\n“absurd or obviously untenable”. In such a case, the judge should\nexplain his conclusion:Underwood(at [10(f)]).\nUltimately, the sentencing judge must do justice and sentence the offender\nas far as possible on the basis of accurate facts: seePP v AnizabteEssa[2009] 3 SLR(R) 327 (at [62]). 25     Second,\nI was troubled by the fact that the appellant had a long list of house-breaking\nantecedents which stretched back to his days as a juvenile offender.\nDespite having been incarcerated for much of his life, the appellant\nhad been unable to remain crime-free for any period of significant length\nfrom the time he was first sentenced to prison in 1995. As noted above,\nhe committed the present offences within two weeks of being released\nafter serving a ten-year sentence of corrective training. 26     The\ncorrective training regime is focussed on therehabilitationof\nthe offender. This is unlike the preventive detention regime which\nprimarily serves the aim of incapacitating recalcitrant offenders\nfrom re-offending through prolonged custody. As was observed inG Ravichander v PP[2002] 2 SLR(R) 665\nat [25]: On the other hand, when determining what\na suitable term is for corrective training, the court should keep\nin mind that this form of punishment, though in substance very similar\nto imprisonment …, should not be treated as a lesser form of preventive\ndetention.Those undergoing corrective training must\nfirst be capable of reform, while those sent in for preventive detention\nare hardened criminals. Sending hardened criminals through the corrective training\nregime would not only dilute the programme’s aims but also endanger the\nreformative path of more promising prisoners.[emphasis\nadded] 27     This\nwas echoed by the Court of Appeal inPP v Rosli\nbin Yassin[2013] 2 SLR 831 (at [11]), where it cited\nwith approval Yong CJ’s observation inPP v\nWong Wing Hung[1999] 3 SLR(R) 304 (at [10]) that the “sentence\nof [preventive detention] is meant essentially for habitual offenders\n… whom the court considers to bebeyond redemptionandtoo recalcitrant for reformation” [emphasis\nadded]. It seemed uncertain to me that corrective training was the\nappropriate sentence in the light of the appellant’s constant re-offending,\nand I thought consideration ought to have been given to whether\npreventive detention was a more suitable option in the absence of\nany other explanation for his behaviour such as a psychiatric disorder. 28     In\nthe premises, I raised three queries at the first hearing of the\nmatter and invited the parties to make further submissions on them: (a)     whether\nthe appellant’s psychiatric condition is irrelevant to sentencing,\nas the Prosecution contends; (b)     how\ncorrective training would benefit the appellant given the scant\nevidence showing any capacity for reform; and (c)     in\nthe event the court was of the view that preventive detention should\nbe imposed upon the appellant, how should the appellant’s previous\nsentence of corrective training affect the court’s consideration\nof the length of a sentence of preventive detention. 29     In\nresponse to query (a), the Prosecution advanced three grounds in support\nof its position that the appellant’s psychiatric condition was irrelevant\nto the sentence that was to be meted upon him: (a)     first,\nit was submitted that there was insufficient evidence to support\na conclusion that the appellant suffered from kleptomania; (b)     second,\nit was submitted that Dr Lim’s report did not state that there was\na causal link between the alleged condition of kleptomania and the\ncommission of the offence; and (c)     finally,\nit was submitted that the severity of the appellant’s criminal tendencies\nrendered any psychiatric condition irrelevant. 30     Counsel\nfor the appellant submitted that the appellant’s medical conditionwasmaterial to the question of whether\nthere were “special reasons” rendering him unfit for corrective\ntraining or preventive detention under s 304(1) and (2) of the Criminal\nProcedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed). 31     Both\nparties also made submissions on the remaining two questions but,\nas it transpired, it was unnecessary for me to consider those matters.",
        "My decision": "32     The\nkey question for me was whether the appellant’s alleged psychiatric\ncondition of kleptomania was a relevant sentencing consideration.\nIn my judgment it was plainly relevant to determining what the appropriate\nsentence should be as well as whether it should be coupled with\na suitable treatment plan. It is well established that rehabilitation\nis often the foremost sentencing consideration for a sentencing\ncourt when dealing with a mentally-disordered offender, including\none suffering from an impulse control disorder such as kleptomania\nthat causes the commission of the offence at hand: seeGoh Lee Yin v PP[2006] 1 SLR(R) 530 at\n[108]; andPP v Goh Lee Yin[2008]\n1 SLR(R) 824 at [97], [100] and [107]. A diagnosis of kleptomania\nwould therefore, at least potentially, be relevant to: (a)     the\nquestion of whether the Appellant is “beyond\nredemption or too recalcitrant for reformation”; (b)     the\nquestion of whether a sentence of incarceration should be paired\nwith a suitable mental health treatment and rehabilitation regime\nthat could be offered to the Appellant by the Prison authorities;\nand (c)     the\nquestion of what type of incarceration should be imposed upon him\nand for what duration. 33     If\nthere exists an underlying psychiatric condition which caused the appellant\nto offend as he did and this were left untreated, the appellant’s cycle\nof re-offending is likely to continue as soon as he is released.\nThis indeed is what happened in the present case and it is consistent\nwith his pattern of offending. 34     The\nProsecution’s submission that there was insufficient evidence to support\nDr Lim’s diagnosis of kleptomania missed the mark. Once it was established\nthat the psychiatric diagnosis of kleptomania is a relevant sentencing\nconsideration, the next question that arises is whether this material\nfact was contested. It undoubtedly was in this case, with the two psychiatric\nopinions pulling in different directions. In these circumstances, it\nwas not evident to me how I, or the DJ, could have resolved this divergence\nwithout evidence being taken from both Dr Goh and Dr Lim. 35     I\nmake no comment on the Prosecution’s submissions on Dr Lim’s report\nbut it was plain to me that I was in no position to dismiss it as patently\nuntenable or absurd. Even if there was a failure to meet one of\nthe diagnostic criteria, it was not evident that this fact alone\nwould rule out a valid diagnosis of kleptomania. 36     As\nfor the Prosecution’s alternative submission that there was no causal\nlink between the appellant’s alleged psychiatric condition and the commission\nof the offences, this appeared to have been inspired by the DJ’s observation\nthat Dr Lim’s report did not specifically state that there was such\na link. 37     I\naccept that as a matter of principle, such a causal link must be proved:\nseeNg So Kuen Connie v PP[2003]\n3 SLR(R) 178 at [58]. In my judgment, where the DJ erred was in\nconcluding that Dr Lim had not attested to such a link. Although\nthere was no sentence in the report that specifically stated a causal\nlink, it was clear that Dr Lim’s report evinced such a causal link.\nDr Lim’s report must be read fairly and in context. In it, he dealt\nsubstantially with the appellant’s past history of house-breaking and\nhis account of events leading to the commission of the offence and\nits aftermath. Dr Lim specifically stated that the recurrence of\nthe appellant’s compulsive house-breaking behaviour could have been\ndue to his ceasing to take the medications he had been prescribed\nin prison after his release; medications which Dr Lim averred “unwittingly\ntreated the symptoms of Impulse-Control Disorder” – this “Impulse-Control\nDisorder” being kleptomania, as Dr Lim made clear at page 7 of his\nreport. In the circumstances, it was clear to me that Dr Lim did\nfind and put forward a causal link between his diagnosis and the\ncommission of the present offences. 38     As\nto the final argument advanced by the Prosecution, although I agreed\nthat the severity of the appellant’s criminal tendencies were potentially\nrelevant to the question of the length of any period of incarceration,\nthis could not render the appellant’s mental condition irrelevant\nas a sentencing consideration. This was especially so here, where the\ncourt had to choose from among a variety of alternative sentences. 39     For\ncompleteness, I mention some other points which I noticed and thought\nmight benefit from further examination in a Newton hearing: (a)     Although\nDr Goh had stated in his report that the appellant was not suffering\nfrom mental illness, the appellant had been prescribed medicines\nwhilst he was in prison which, according to Dr Lim, were medicines\nthat are prescribed in order to treat psychiatric conditions. (b)     Although\nboth Dr Lim’s report and the CT Report averred that the appellant\nhad previously undergone mental health treatment in prison, Dr Goh\nappeared to be under the impression that the appellant had never\nundergone any prior treatment for a mental health disorder. (c)     There\nwas a diagnosis of “mood disorder” in the CT Report which was not\nfurther elaborated on and which remains unexplained. (d)     Finally,\nas previously mentioned at [25] above, I was struck by the very\nshort periods of time that elapsed between the appellant’s release\nfrom prison after long sentences for property related offences and\nthe commission of further offences of the same sort. I considered that\nit would be useful to invite the psychiatrists to comment on whether\nsuch a pattern of offending could be attributed to a person of normal\nmental health. 40     For\nall these reasons, I held that a Newton hearing would be appropriate\nin the circumstances. In the light of this, there was no need for me\nto consider at this stage whether corrective training or preventive detention\nwas appropriate. Any sentencing decision should be taken on the basis\nof the conclusions that are reached at the Newton hearing.",
        "Conclusion": "41     For\nthe foregoing reasons, I allowed the appeal and set aside the DJ’s sentence.\nI ordered that the case be remitted to the same DJ for a Newton hearing.\nWithout seeking to constrain the discretion of the DJ, I directed that\nthe following questions should be considered: (a)     whether\nthe appellant is a kleptomaniac and if so, the relevance of that\ncondition to the commission of his offences; and (b)     if\nthe appellant is a kleptomaniac what the appropriate type and period\nof incarceration should be, and whether the appellant should be\noffered an appropriate treatment programme that could be undertaken\nin conjunction with the period of incarceration to which he is eventually\nsentenced. 42     Counsel\nfor both parties agreed that the appellant should continue to be\nremanded in the meantime."
