        "Close of prosecution case": "20\n\n        At the close of the prosecution’s case,\n\ndefence counsel did not make any submissions. Having regard to the evidence presented by\n\nthe prosecution, I found that there was a case which, if unrebutted, would warrant the\n\nconviction of the accused. The courses available to the accused were explained to him. In\n\nthe event, the accused elected to give evidence on oath. His evidence in defence insofar\n\nas is material is as follows.",
        "The defence case": "21\n\n        The accused is now 44 years of age. He is\n\nsingle and at the time of his arrest was unemployed. His educational attainments did not\n\nreach beyond secondary two. Since his mother’s demise in October 2001, the accused\n\nhas been living alone at the HDB flat at Blk 125 Hougang Avenue 1, #07-1476. Just before\n\nhis arrest on 11 April 2002, he had a number of friends including Acit, Joe, Ibrahim, Roy\n\nand Ahmad visiting him at this flat on a regular basis to watch television and to play\n\ncomputer games. He let his friends freely into his house and they could enter the flat by\n\nthemselves as they were given the number to the combination lock at the iron gate. The\n\nwooden door was usually unlocked and it could be opened from outside.22\n\n        On 10 April 2002, Joe, Roy, Ahmad and Acit were\n\nwith the accused before the CNB raided the flat. Acit came to the house at about 4.00pm,\n\nand Joe came about an hour later. They then watched television and smoked heroin in one of\n\nthe bedrooms.23\n\n        At about 8pm, Roy came to the flat followed by\n\nAhmad about half an hour later. Both Roy and Ahmad had with them a haversack each. That\n\nevening they smoked heroin again and also consumed some Ice after that.24\n\n        At about 10.00pm or so, a salesman came to the\n\nflat attempting to sell the accused an alarm system. He was there for about half an hour\n\nand the accused ordered an alarm from him to be installed the following day. His friends\n\nremained, in the meantime, quietly in the second bedroom.25\n\n        After the salesman had left, the accused\n\nreturned to the other bedroom. Joe told everyone that the alarm salesman was not a\n\nsalesman at all as he did not visit other neighbouring units for sale. He surmised that\n\nthe salesman was either a CNB officer or an informer. The accused then told everyone to\n\nleave the flat. Everyone, except Ahmad, left immediately. Only Ahmad stayed behind as he\n\nwanted to depart from the unit together with the accused.26\n\n        The accused said that Joe told him that he\n\n(Joe) would telephone the accused should there be any CNB officers in or around the block\n\nof flats.27\n\n        The accused switched off all the lights except\n\nfor the one in the bathroom. He presently took a shower while Ahmad, who was still\n\ncarrying his haversack with him, waited. After the shower, as he was about to switch off\n\nhis laptop computer, some CNB officers arrived and started banging on his door, calling\n\nout his name.28\n\n        At first, the accused remained in the master\n\nbedroom. When the CNB officers kept knocking at his door, the accused went into the living\n\nroom of the unit. He saw so many people at the door and was convinced that they were\n\npolice officers. He said sorry to them and immediately returned to the master bedroom. He\n\nwas in a state of panic. Ahmad had by this time climbed out of the flat and half his body\n\nwas out of the window. Ahmad, who had his haversack with him, urged the accused to follow\n\nhim and escape through the window.29\n\n        The accused was in shock. For a while, he sat\n\non his bed to reflect. At this point in time, he happened to glance at the blue bag in his\n\nroom. This blue bag which was usually empty had this time a plastic bag inside. The blue\n\nbag was found unzipped and fully open. He looked into the white plastic bag and saw a few\n\nslabs of cannabis and a block inside. He concluded that Ahmad had off-loaded these\n\ncannabis in his flat before climbing out of the window. The accused then took the white\n\nplastic bag and threw it out of the window with all its contents. He looked out and seeing\n\nAhmad scaling down he also decided to follow suit.30\n\n        The accused added that it was the first time he\n\nsaw so muchganjahin his house. He knew for sure that they belonged to Ahmad\n\nbecause Ahmad was a knownganjahtrafficker and on two occasions Ahmad had brought\n\nto his flat a small slabs ofganjahfor him to cut and loosen up. But the accused\n\nhad never seen or known that Ahmad with so muchganjahin his possession.31\n\n        After throwing two of his handphones out of the\n\nwindow, he looked down the window again. Ahmad had gone by this time. He then scaled down\n\nthe flat. At the sixth storey, he tried to get the lady occupant to let him in. Instead of\n\nhelping him, she kept screaming and so he scaled all the way down the block.32\n\n            As he reached the\n\nground floor, he paused for a moment to decide which direction to proceed. He then heard\n\nsomeone from the car park shouting to him to stop. He immediately started running and\n\nmanaged to get a taxi to take him to Geylang Serai. The CNB officers trailed him and\n\narrested him at Geylang Serai.33\n\n        The accused admitted that he gave the\n\nstatements tendered by the prosecution in evidence, voluntarily. However, he attempted to\n\nretract some parts of the said statement claiming that the investigation officer had\n\nincluded some details on his own. He also said that he had misunderstood the recording\n\nofficer in relation to some material aspects concerning the ownership of the drugs.34\n\n        In fact, the accused endeavoured to retract\n\nmost of the incriminating segments of his statements. As it would be too long to go\n\nthrough each and every segment of his retractions, I shall refer only to the most\n\nimportant ones. As regards his statement (exh P-84) made on 16 April 2002, he denied that\n\nhe told the recording officer (see para 6 at page 198 of the preliminary inquiry records)\n\nthat he helped Ahmad to pack and weigh the cannabis. He added that when he was giving the\n\nstatement he was only referring to one small slab and not others. He also said that he did\n\nnot make the second sentence in para 8 of P-84 (page 200 of the PI records) which reads:\n\n‘I admitted that the cannabis found below was mine …’.35\n\n        Similarly, he also retracted para 49 of his\n\nstatement made on 25 April 2002 (exh P-88) where he had said that he helped to pack, weigh\n\nand store the cannabis.36\n\n        As regards para 53 of his statement (exh P-89)\n\nmade on 22 May 2002 (page 217 of the preliminary inquiry records), he alleged that he told\n\nthe investigating officer whatever the officer wanted him to say. He claimed that he did\n\nnot know what was meant by the term ‘transaction’, appearing in the sentence:\n\n‘I wish to say that I only helped Ahmad to keep accounts of his drugs and keep track\n\nof the drug money transaction.’ In relation to the opening sentence in para 61 of his\n\nstatement (exh P-90) made on 24 May 2002, he denied telling the investigating officer\n\nthat: ‘Ahmad was trying to use me to sell … cannabis … So I helped him by\n\nkeeping drug accounts, packing and weighing the cannabis.’37\n\n        In sum, his evidence was that the drugs were\n\nnot his, they belonged to Ahmad, he became aware of the seized drugs only moments before\n\nhe had thrown them out of the window and consequently he had no intention to traffic in\n\nthe drugs under reference.38\n\n        It must be stated at this juncture that the\n\nfollowing aspects, (as stated by defence counsel in his submission) were never in dispute.(a) The accused threw the\n\n    cannabis out of his flat through the window;(b) The drugs were in his master\n\n    bedroom in a white plastic bag which in turn was housed in a blue bag;(c) The accused scaled down the\n\n    flat through the window at the rear of Block 125;(d) He ran off and took a taxi to\n\n    Geylang Serai; and(e) There he was arrested.",
        "Arguments, issues and conclusion": "39\n\n        The prosecution’s submission was that the\n\naccused was the only person in the flat at the time of the raid and that he was in\n\npossession and had full knowledge of the drugs mentioned in the charge. It was the\n\nprosecution’s further contention that the accused was in possession of the said drugs\n\nfor the purposes of trafficking having regard to the quantity of the drugs seized. In\n\nthis, the prosecution relied on the accused’s statements where he had admitted that\n\nhe had cut, weighed and packed the drugs. Further, the prosecution also relied on the\n\nprovisions of s 17 of the MDA which states that any person who is proved to have had in\n\nhis possession more than 15 grams of cannabis, is presumed to have had that drug in his\n\npossession for the purposes of trafficking unless it is proved that his possession of that\n\ndrug was not for that purpose.40\n\n        The first main issue in this case was whether\n\nthe accused was proved to have had in his possession the drugs mentioned in the charge.\n\nThe second main issue was whether such possession was for the purpose of trafficking. In\n\nregard to the first main issue, there was no denial by the accused that the said drugs\n\nwere in his flat. The only disclaimer by him was that they did not belong to him but to\n\nAhmad whose particulars and whereabouts he could not satisfactorily provide either to the\n\ninvestigating officer or to the court. He said that once the CNB officers were at the\n\nentrance of his flat demanding entry, Ahmad scooted through the window after which he too\n\nmade his exit.41\n\n        The issue then turned to the existence as well\n\nas the presence of Ahmad in his flat at the material time.42\n\n        Defence counsel, after submitting that the\n\ncourt should accept the evidence of the accused on the involvement of Ahmad and his\n\npresence in the flat at the material time, urged the court to discount the evidence of Sgt\n\nGan, who claimed that he was on the lookout for persons escaping through the rear of Block\n\n125 Hougang Avenue 1 and that he did not see anyone else other than the accused climbing\n\ndown the rear wall of the block of flats. Although in my opinion, Sgt Gan’s evidence\n\nleft a lot to be desired, my conclusion having regard to the evidence of all the\n\nprosecution witnesses, was that the presence of Ahmad in the flat at the material time was\n\nmade up by the accused. If indeed Ahmad was present on that day, the accused would have\n\nmentioned this at the very first opportunity when he gave his first statement (exh P-77)\n\non 11 April 2002. In fact what he said in that statement claiming that Ahmad brought theganjahfive or six days ago did not seem to cohere with his current claim that Ahmad brought the\n\ndrugs only on 11 April 2002.43\n\n        When questioned why he did not mention that\n\nAhmad had also escaped through the window on that day, his only explanation was that it\n\ndid not occur to him at that time to narrate Ahmad’s escape and that no officer had\n\never asked him where Ahmad was (pages 714 and 715 of the NE). In fact, it was not until 16\n\nApril 2002 (exh P-84) the accused seemed to have mentioned the alleged escape of this\n\nAhmad.44\n\n        In my determination, the accused’s\n\ninability to provide the address, contact number as well as whereabouts of this so-called\n\nAhmad, an alleged childhood friend known to him over 25 years, most certainly threw cold\n\nwater on his claim concerning the presence and escape of Ahmad from the flat at the\n\nrelevant time. There was also a glaring inconsistency between the evidence of the accused\n\nin court and his statements about Ahmad. In court, the accused claimed that he had regular\n\ncontact with Ahmad after mid-2001 as Ahmad started visiting his flat frequently. However,\n\nin para 19 of P-84 (statement by the accused on 16 April 2002), he had said: ‘I only\n\nremember renewing my contract with him two weeks ago.’45\n\n        In my finding, the accused’s accounts as\n\nto the existence as well as the presence of Ahmad at his flat were entirely unconvincing.\n\nThe defence of the accused that the drugs belonged to someone else and not to him was, in\n\nmy determination, a complete fabrication.46\n\n        The accused attempted to retract and disown\n\nmany a passage from his statements. The passages disowned were all incriminating in\n\nnature. In my view, the retractions were pure afterthoughts and after review of all the\n\nevidence and having regard to the manner in which he testified, I was satisfied that the\n\nsaid statements were indeed made by him voluntarily and they reflected the actuality of\n\nthe events save for the fabrication concerning the presence of Ahmad in the flat at the\n\nmaterial time and his claim that the drugs were brought to his flat by Ahmad without his\n\nknowledge and concurrence.47\n\n        InYap Sow Keong v Public Prosecutor(1947) 13 MLJ 90, the Court of Appeal laid down the principle that even if a confession\n\nhas been retracted by an accused, the accused may be convicted on the strength of it\n\nalone, so long as the court is satisfied that it is true. In my finding, the retracted\n\nparts told a consistent story that the accused was dealing with drugs knowingly for the\n\npurpose of trafficking. His admission at para 8 of exh P-84 (statement made on 16 April\n\n2002 at page 200 of the PI records) that the ‘cannabis found below wasmine…’ (emphasis added) was a convincing piece of evidence to justify the conclusion\n\nthat the accused was in possession of the drugs and that he knew its nature.48\n\n        Dealing with the second issue whether the\n\naccused was in possession of the drugs for the purpose of trafficking, it must be observed\n\nat this stage that quite apart from the applicability of the provision of s 17 of the MDA\n\nwhich had not been rebutted by any acceptable evidence by the accused, there was\n\ncompelling evidence that the drugs were indeed for trafficking by the accused. The\n\naccused’s reference to weighing, packing and cutting led me to only one conclusion\n\nthat he was and has been a trafficker in the drugs he was in possession of. His notes of\n\nthe price of the drugs, drug sales transactions and his code word ‘green’ for\n\ncannabis (see para 53 of exh P-89, statement of 22 May 2002 at page 217 of the PI\n\nrecords), all went to reinforce my view that he was a trafficker in full bloom. At any\n\nrate, the quantity of the drugs seized led me to conclude that they were indeed for\n\ntrafficking.49\n\n        Having considered all the evidence, I was\n\nsatisfied that the prosecution had amply discharged its ultimate burden in proving the\n\ncharge against the accused beyond a reasonable doubt and that the accused had not, on\n\nbalance of probabilities, rebutted the operative presumptions under s 17 of the MDA nor\n\nhad he established his defence. Consequently I found him guilty, convicted him of the\n\ncharge and sentenced him to the only sentence prescribed by law.50\n\n        Following his conviction, leave was granted to\n\nthe prosecution to withdraw the charge stood down and pursuant to s 177 of the CPC, the\n\naccused was granted a discharge amounting to an acquittal in relation to the said charge.",
