        "In relation to Paragraph (2) of the said letter:": "(iv) In compliance with paragraph (g) of the Settlement Agreement,\n\n  our Clients provided your Clients with equipment worth S$18,433.33, full particulars of which your\n\n  Clients are well aware of, short particulars are as follows:a) InFocus LP 335 valued at $10,800.00; andb) Various equipment included in Invoice No. 2008-6972 for the amount of\n\n      S7,633.33.(v) Further, our Clients instructions are that your Clients had\n\n    unreasonably requested for the delivery of the equipment listed in paragraph 2(iv) above within\n\n    an unreasonably short period.(vi) Further, in breach of the Settlement Agreement, your Clients had\n\n    purchased the equipment listed in paragraph 2(iv)(b) above from their own supplier and simply\n\n    invoiced the purchase to our Clients.(vii) In light of your Clients breach as set out in paragraphs 2(i) and\n\n    2(vi) above, our Clients are discharged from total performance of their obligations under the\n\n    Settlement Agreement.3. Pursuant to the matters set out in paragraph 2 above, our Clients reiterate\n\n  their denial of your Clients alleged claims and we hereby put you onNOTICEthat\n\n  your Clients are in breach of the Settlement Agreement. We have our Clients firm instructions\n\n  to commence legal proceedings against you for damages and to recover all legal costs and\n\n  interests.\"60 On 6 November 2000, the Plaintiffs former solicitors took the position that\n\nthe Defendants had by their conduct repudiated the Settlement Agreement. Their letter read:\"We refer to your letter dated 12 October 2000.Before dealing with the specific issues raised in your letter, we put you on\n\n  notice that your clients are in breach of the Settlement Agreement and have by their conduct\n\n  repudiated the agreement. Our clients accept your clients repudiation and expressly reserve their\n\n  rights to sue for damages and/or seek other reliefs.In relation to Paragraph 2(i) to (iii) of your letter:Your clients had attempted (after repeated requests by our clients) to comply\n\n  with paragraph (a.1) of the Settlement Agreement (the \"Agreement\") on 11 September 2000.\n\n  However in breach of the terms of the Agreement, your clients had failed to provide our clients\n\n  with computer hardware and software as identified under paragraph (a.1) of the Agreement. The IBM\n\n  server your clients had attempted to deliver was not of the correct model or specification.In addition, your clients had not also delivered the supporting software. Your\n\n  clients assertion that the supporting software would be provided thereafter was not what was\n\n  agreed between the parties. Our clients here will refer to the Agreement for its full terms and\n\n  effects. Your clients representative was duly informed of the reasons for the rejection.In relation to Paragraph 2(iv) to (vii) of your letter:As indicated on paragraph (iv) of your letter, we have been instructed by our\n\n  clients that your clients have provided our clients with equipment worth S$17,896.44 (excluding\n\n  GST) as indicated correctly in our letter dated 21 September 2000. The balance due to our clients\n\n  remain at $12,103.56. We note here your clients admission of liability and breach of the terms of\n\n  the Agreement.Your clients allegation now raised as an afterthought, that our clients had\n\n  unreasonably requested for the delivery of the equipment within an unreasonably short period is\n\n  baseless. Our instructions and evidence seem to indicate to the contrary. As for your clients\n\n  contention that our clients had in purported breach of the Agreement purchased the equipments\n\n  as listed on paragraph 2(iv)(b) of your letter, we have been instructed that the same was done\n\n  with the express and/or implied consent of your clients and in compliance with the terms of the\n\n  Agreement.As for the penultimate paragraph of your letter, your clients allegation to the\n\n  effect that our clients have breached the terms of the Agreement are hereby and herewith\n\n  categorically denied. If indeed you have your clients firm instructions to commence legal\n\n  proceedings then we now write to inform you that we have our clients firm instructions to accept\n\n  service of legal process on behalf of our clients. In any case please let know if you have your\n\n  clients instructions to accept service of the Writ of Summons.\"61 As the Settlement Agreement had been terminated, the Plaintiffs did not\n\nconfirm the new design for the website and the Defendants also did not plan and execute the revamped\n\nwebsite, which to date was still not operational, resulting in the Plaintiffs being unable to carry\n\nout any electronic commerce. The Defendants had also not made any attempt to deliver to the\n\nPlaintiffs a server which would comply with the specifications set out in the Settlement Agreement\n\nand which was suitable and fit for the Plaintiffs particular purpose. The Plaintiffs claimed they\n\nhad thereby suffered loss and damage as particularised in the Schedule to their Statement of Claim.62 In cross-examination, Chow explained that the insistence on having the server\n\ndelivered to the Plaintiffs premises was essentially to test the Defendants sincerity and\n\nability to carry out the terms of the Settlement Agreement. Asked whether there were differences\n\nbetween the original delivery order and the new one, Chow said that the former mentioned\n\n\"3500\" whereas the latter merely stated \"Netfinity\". However, he accepted that\n\nthere were other differences between the two delivery orders although he did not know whether these\n\nwere the reason the Defendants wanted to substitute the original delivery order.63 The first draft Settlement Agreement was prepared by the Defendants Alvin\n\nTeo. Chow was concerned that the server to be supplied should be a new machine and not one put\n\ntogether by the Defendants using components from various sources. Chow added to the terms by the\n\n\"cut and paste\" method from other documents. He wanted the server to be from IBM or\n\nCompaq. Alvin Teo recommended the Raid 5 software. Further, if the server had to be taken away for\n\nsome maintenance work, it must be brought back within 48 hours. The Defendants were allowed a\n\nmaximum of two such occurrences  the \"two strikes and youre out\" approach. Alvin\n\nqualified that clause by excluding liability for acts of God and other matters not within the\n\nDefendants control. There were many drafts of the Settlement Agreement before it was finalized\n\nand signed on 11 July 2000. Chow had suggested that they instruct a lawyer to prepare the Settlement\n\nAgreement but the Defendants Alvin Teo maintained that there was no need to do so. Chow consulted\n\nsome friends during the negotiations leading to the Settlement Agreement. He did not, however, seek\n\nthe advice of the information technology professionals in the Plaintiffs parent company.64 In respect of the Defendants application for a grant from the NCB under the\n\nLECP, one of the conditions imposed was that the project must not commence before the letter of\n\noffer was sent by the NCB. The letter of offer would be sent only after NCB had evaluated the\n\nproposals of the Plaintiffs electronic commerce project. Asked whether the Plaintiffs had\n\nnullified the grant by starting the mixtown.com project before receiving the NCBs letter of\n\noffer, Chow was of the view that encoding their products, taking pictures thereof and keying in of\n\ndata were mere preparatory work. The Plaintiffs had such things ready as they were part and parcel\n\nof their non-electronic commerce business.65 Chows idea of having no down-time was that there should be no unscheduled\n\ndown-time, i.e. when the website was not operating. Scheduled down-time would be those periods when\n\nthe server was undergoing regular maintenance and such could be arranged during the off-peak hours.\n\nAdvance notice could also be given to the users. During the period of servicing the server, at least\n\nthe websites homepage must be up. There must not be a blank screen. It was crucial to have the\n\nwebsite up 24 hours a day because the Plaintiffs would not just be selling products but would also\n\nbe creating a lifestyle for the users. Chow was very impressed at that time with the Defendants\n\nGatecrash.com which saw millions of hits daily when it was launched. In fact, it was the Defendants\n\nAlvin Teo who advised Chow not to underestimate Internet traffic.66 According to Chow, hot swap capability was not a mere solution  it was a\n\n\"must have\". He first heard about hot swap capability around April 2000 when Alvin Teo or\n\nErnest Eu (of the Defendants) mentioned the term to him in the course of their negotiations for the\n\nSettlement Agreement. The Defendants mentioned that the server they were providing was no ordinary\n\nserver, that it had some \"swap\" ability and did not have to be shut down unless it was for\n\nscheduled maintenance. The requirement of hot swap capability was however not specified in the\n\nSettlement Agreement as it was one among so many other terms.67 After the 3500 server had been rejected, the Defendants arranged a meeting in\n\nthe morning of 20 September 2000 at the Regent Hotel. Chow went with Emily Lim to meet Alvin Teo and\n\nErnest Eu. Chow did not want further \"finger-pointing\". He told the Defendants to just\n\ngive him the server promised and, if they did not have enough funds, to use the $30,000 budgeted for\n\nthe hardware. He did not say specifically that he wanted a server with hot swap capability and\n\nneither did he ask for a 5100 server. He told the Defendants to get a better server.68 In re-examination, Chow maintained that the website should have no unscheduled\n\ndown-time and it was up to the Defendants to achieve that, whether by means of hot swap capability\n\nor otherwise. There was therefore nothing in the Settlement Agreement about hot swap capability.\n\nHowever, if the unscheduled down-time was caused by something unforeseen, such as act of God, he\n\nwould not hold the Defendants liable. He accepted that the words \"IBM server\" in the\n\nSettlement Agreement could apply to a 3500 or a 5100 server but only the 5100 server had hot swap\n\ncapability.69 Where NCBs condition for the grant was concerned, the Defendants had been\n\nengaged by the Plaintiffs as their information technology consultants and were fully aware of NCBs\n\ncondition from the outset. In the end, the Plaintiffs did not accept the grant from NCB anyway as\n\ntheir website was not up. The Plaintiffs did not approach another consultant to set up the website\n\nbecause their management and their business partners and suppliers were awaiting the outcome of\n\nthese legal proceedings.THE CASE FOR THE DEFENDANTS70 Chua Boon Wee, the Managing Director of X-Media Technologies Pte Ltd (\"XMT\"),\n\ntestified that on 31 July 2000, the Defendants placed an order for a server with his company. A\n\nQuotation/Confirmation Order dated 1 August 2000 was furnished to the Defendants, quoting $7,900 as\n\nthe price for the IBM Netfinity server and another $8,750 for add-ons.71 XMT had to order the components to assemble the server which it did from\n\nDigiland.com International Pte Ltd. It was the industry standard that a customized server would take\n\nthree to four weeks to deliver. Due to the unavailability of stocks, Digiland indicated that it\n\nwould deliver the server first and the additional components at a later date. These components were\n\nthe two additional 9.1 GB hard disk, the additional Pentium III-733 CPU, additional 384 MB ECC SDRAM\n\nand the RAID controller. They were scheduled to arrive by the end of September 2000.72 On 30 August 2000, Digiland informed XMT that it would not be able to deliver\n\nas scheduled due to a delay in shipment by IBM. The server was delivered to XMT on 8 September 2000,\n\nFriday, at 5.30 pm. The Defendants instructed XMT to deliver the server to the Plaintiffs office.\n\nOn 11 September 2000, Monday, XMT did so.73 In the evening of 11 September 2000, the Defendants informed Chua that the\n\nPlaintiffs had rejected the server and wanted to return it. The next morning (12 September 2000),\n\nXMT collected the server from the Plaintiffs office.74 On 14 September 2000, Alvin Teo informed XMT by email stating that he wanted\n\nthe Defendants to cease communications with the Plaintiffs for the time being. Upon receipt of the\n\nnews, Chua immediately instructed his staff to suspend the delivery of the additional components.75 About two weeks later, Chua was told by the Defendants that they wanted the\n\nadditional components. The order for those was therefore reinstated. They were delivered\n\nsubsequently to XMT which was still holding them.76 Chua explained that the delivery man had handed over the wrong (earlier)\n\ndelivery order to the Plaintiffs on 11 September 2000. They therefore had to retrieve it in exchange\n\nfor the correct delivery order the same day. The earlier delivery order which was prepared by one of\n\nthe account clerks in XMT was supposed to have been rendered void already by the Accounts Department\n\nbut a copy was left with the delivery department.77 XMTs purchase order sent to Digiland had the model number \"3500\n\nM20\" included because the Defendants had informed XMT to look for the model that matched the\n\ndescription in XMTs quotation/confirmation order. XMTs and the Defendants offices were\n\nlocated very close to each other. The Defendants owned 51% of XMT while Chua had a 12% stake in the\n\nDefendants.78 Chua did not know why the model number was deleted from the second delivery\n\norder. He believed the information in the second delivery order was keyed in based on the\n\nQuotation/Confirmation Order dated 1 August 2000 and that the first delivery orders information\n\ncame from XMTs Purchase Order to Digiland dated 24 August 2000. He disagreed with the suggestion\n\nthat the model number was deleted upon the Defendants instructions.79 The Defendants Further and Better Particulars indicated that the clerical\n\nerrors in the first delivery order were discovered on or about 8 September 2000. Chua did not know\n\nwhy the errors were not corrected over the weekend until 11 September 2000.80 Ernest Eu, the Chief Executive Officer of the Defendants, testified that Alvin\n\nTeo had been negotiating with the Plaintiffs Chow to reach an amicable settlement over the delays\n\nin the Plaintiffs website. Ernest Eu was involved only in the business and not the technological\n\naspects of the Defendants. Alvin Teo was abroad from 20 to 22 June 2000. On 22 June 2000, Ernest Eu\n\nand Lim Cher San (the Defendants Chief Operations Officer) met Chow and Emily Lim to discuss\n\nfurther the settlement terms offered by Alvin Teo on 19 June 2000.81 At that meeting, Chow said he was not satisfied with the terms offered by\n\nAlvin Teo. He wanted the Defendants to compensate the Plaintiffs with some $30,000 worth of computer\n\nhardware. That meant a cash outlay for the Defendants which they could ill afford. The meeting ended\n\nwith the parties apparently having agreed on certain terms but that was not to be as there were\n\nseveral more rounds of discussions before the Settlement Agreement was finally signed on 11 July\n\n2000.82 Around 12 September 2000, Alvin Teo informed Ernest Eu that Chow was very\n\nupset and wanted to terminate the Settlement Agreement over the issue of the server. Ernest Eu\n\nwanted to resolve the matter amicably with Chow and therefore called him on 19 September 2000 to\n\narrange a meeting the next day.83 In the morning of 20 September 2000, Ernest Eu, Alvin Teo and Lim Cher San met\n\nChow and Emily Lim at the Regent Hotel. It was a breakfast meeting. Chow declined the food and\n\ndrinks and they got down to business. Chow demanded an IBM server of a different and more expensive\n\nmodel from that specified in the Settlement Agreement but did not state the model number. The\n\nDefendants representatives explained to Chow that the 3500 server met the specifications but he\n\nretorted, \"This is not what I want\". Chow did not explain further. When told by the\n\nDefendants that they could not agree to meet his demand as it went beyond the scope of the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Chow left abruptly. The meeting lasted about 20 minutes only. The term\n\n\"hot swap capability\" never featured in the discussions. It only surfaced in the\n\naffidavits of evidence-in-chief.84 Lim Cher San, the Defendants Chief Operations Officer, testified that his\n\npart in the mixtown.com project was to ensure that the end product was delivered according to\n\nschedule. Although he felt that the Defendants were not completely to blame for the delays in the\n\nproject, the Defendants decided to work out a settlement plan to compensate the Plaintiffs over the\n\ndelays. He worked with Alvin Teo towards this end.85 In the evening of 19 June 2000, Lim Cher San and Alvin Teo met Chow at the\n\nShangri-La Hotel to discuss the draft settlement agreement sent to Chow earlier that day. Chow\n\nexpressed his displeasure with the website and spoke about doing a rebuild.86 At the end of that meeting, the parties agreed to do a rebuild of the website\n\nas part of the settlement terms. Nevertheless, the website still proceeded to have a User Acceptance\n\nTest (\"UAT\") on 23 June 2000 with a view to a public launch on 1 July 2000. The settlement\n\nterms offered by the Defendants were:(1) Provision of about $90,000 worth of maintenance services which included\n\n  service to develop mixtown.com2 and a webpage design revamp service on mixtown.com worth $25,000\n\n  to be executed once the project was commissioned;(2) The Defendants would waive the balance amount due from the Plaintiffs for\n\n  the mixtown.com project;(3) The Defendants would assist in selling $100,000 worth of Pacific Internet\n\n  banner advertisements; and(4) The Defendants would provide $25,000 worth of credit for any web\n\n  development services to be provided by them.87 The mixtown.com2 website would involve a substantial commitment in time\n\nalthough the business model would remain the same  i.e. retailing of new and used school\n\ntextbooks, school uniform, food and beverage via electronic commerce. The revamped website would\n\nhave to be a complete redesign and rebuild as the original one was based on the PERL platform while\n\nthe new one would be built on the Cold Fusion platform, a different programming language.88 Before Alvin Teo left for Bandung in the morning the next day (20 June 2000),\n\nhe told Lim Cher San to write an email to Chow on his behalf to confirm the settlement terms reached\n\nthe night before. Lim Cher San did that.89 Around 21 June 2000, Emily Lim called Lim Cher San to inform him that Chow was\n\nstill not satisfied with those terms. Instead of the $25,000 credit for any web development\n\nservices, Chow wanted $25,000 to be used for computer hardware purchases instead.90 On 22 June 2000, Lim Cher San emailed Emily Lim to say that that would be\n\nbeyond the Defendants prime business function. At about 2.30 pm that same day, the Defendants\n\n(Ernest Eu and Lim Cher San) met Chow and Emily Lim for further discussions. Chow refused to budge\n\non his demand for $30,000 worth of hardware purchases and the Defendants gave in to his demand. The\n\nterms of the settlement offer were therefore modified accordingly to become even more substantial\n\nand favourable to the Plaintiffs compared with the original proposal made by Alvin Teo to Chow on 15\n\nJune 2000.91 On 23 June 2000, the website passed the UAT successfully. On 26 June 2000, the\n\nPlaintiffs complained by email that the registration could not be done on the website. Lim Cher San\n\nsuspected that it could be due to the Defendants tidying up the codes of the website or could be due\n\nto the Plaintiffs using an older version of the Netscape browser which would not support some of the\n\ncommands.92 On 28 June 2000, Lim Cher San, Alvin Teo and Sherine Teo met Chow and Emily\n\nLim at the Plaintiffs office at 11 am to try to resolve the registration problem. They would at\n\nthe same time check on the Plaintiffs browser version. However, Chow refused to accept that there\n\ncould be a simple explanation for the registration problem. He decided he did not want the\n\nmixtown.com website anymore and called off the 1 July 2000 public launch. He wanted the Defendants\n\nto concentrate instead on mixtown.com2. In addition, he wanted better settlement terms, in\n\nparticular, the provision of a server of agreed specifications at the Defendants cost.93 Lim Cher San was of the view that the website could have been up and ready for\n\nelectronic commerce by 1 July 2000 had Chow not called off the launch. Lim Cher San was not involved\n\nin the further negotiations which followed and which resulted in the Settlement Agreement of 11 July\n\n2000.94 On 29 July 2000, Emily Lim told Lim Cher San that Chow wanted the new server\n\ndelivered to the Plaintiffs office. The request seemed strange to Lim Cher San as the server to\n\nhost the website was meant to be located in the Defendants premises so that they could amend or\n\nupdate the contents of the website. Further, the software for the server had not been installed. He\n\ntried to explain all these to Emily Lim but she insisted on the delivery of the server nevertheless.\n\nBemused as the Defendants were, they decided to accede to the Plaintiffs request anyway.95 Lim Cher San told Emily by email that day that he would be placing an order\n\nfor the server on 31 July 2000 and that it would take about three to four weeks for the server to\n\narrive. He did so with XMT.96 Unfortunately, the server was delayed because certain of the additional\n\ncomponents were unavailable. When Chow was informed of this, he gave them an ultimatum by email on 7\n\nSeptember 2000 in the following terms:\"Hi Sherine Cannot simply wait to be informed when delivered please get\n\n  the company to confirm delivery date. If your contractor is not able to deliver by next Thursday\n\n  Sep 14 please cancel the server for we want another IBM model and specifications and model. I\n\n  think the server is standard and not so specially made for us we would rather wait for the\n\n  server we now wanted. Thank you. Regards, Chow\".97 On 8 September 2000, Lim Cher San informed Emily Lim that the 3500 server\n\nwould be delivered on Monday, 11 September 2000 before noon and the additional components at the end\n\nof the month. That was done. The rejection of the server followed.98 The Defendants had furnished the proposed draft specifications for the\n\nmixtown.com2 to the Plaintiffs on 28 June 2000 but had received no confirmation of their acceptance.\n\nAs late as 1 September 2000, the time line for the revamped website was still not settled. The\n\nSettlement Agreement allowed the Defendants two months to plan, develop and execute the revamped\n\nwebsite from the date of the Plaintiffs confirmation of the scope of the new design. Failure to\n\ndeliver the additional components on 11 September 2000 was not a fundamental or material breach that\n\nentitled the Plaintiffs to reject the server. The Defendants were complying with the Settlement\n\nAgreement but the Plaintiffs had repudiated it by their unreasonable rejection of the server. The\n\nDefendants were therefore discharged from further performance.99 In cross-examination, Lim Cher San explained that an UAT was the event where,\n\nat an agreed time and place, the Plaintiffs as customers and the Defendants as vendors would meet to\n\nconduct a quality control test on the website, during which time fictitious data would be fed into\n\nthe system. After the UAT, the parties would list out any outstanding issues or work to be done. As\n\nthe UAT was on 23 June 2000 and the launch date was supposed to have been 1 July 2000, the\n\nDefendants had to do a lot of work in tidying up the codes of the website and removing the\n\nfictitious data. Emily Lim had also given the Plaintiffs a lot of things to do.100 While the Defendants did not advise the Plaintiffs not to go into the website\n\nafter the UAT, they were not expecting them to do so either as the test was meant for one day only.\n\nIf the Plaintiffs had checked with the Defendants about their problems in accessing the website, the\n\nDefendants would have told them that they were doing the tidying up. As for the possibility that the\n\nproblems could be due to an older version of the browser being used by the Plaintiffs, Lim Cher San\n\nsaid there were four or five personal computers at the Plaintiffs office and they had tested the\n\nwebsite on only one of them. He therefore would not know what browser was being used in the other\n\npersonal computers. In any event, the Defendants passed the UAT on 23 June 2000. Since the question\n\nof registration was crucial, the Defendants cleaned that up first before doing other things.101 Lim Cher San agreed that there were discrepancies between the Defendants\n\nevidence and their Further and Better Particulars in respect of the date of the meeting during which\n\nthe launch date of 1 July 2000 was called off, the representatives of the Defendants who attended\n\nthat meeting and the venue. The Defendants were very relieved that the launch date had been put back\n\nas they could now concentrate on mixtown.com2. He disagreed that the launch date had been postponed\n\nbecause the Defendants could not fix the problems relating to registration.102 Lim Cher San did not see the purpose of the Plaintiffs in wanting the server\n\nin their office. Even if they installed the software there, they would still have to bring it back\n\nto their Data Centre before the website could go live on the world wide web. There would be\n\nunnecessary travelling time. Each time the Defendants needed to do some updating, they would have to\n\nbring additional hardware to the Plaintiffs office. There would also be inconvenience should they\n\nrequire to work past normal office hours. During the negotiations for the Settlement Agreement,\n\nthere was no mention of the date of delivery of the server. He could not remember whether the\n\nparties had agreed verbally for the server to be delivered to the Plaintiffs premises on a date\n\nto be notified by the Plaintiffs.103 At the meeting on 20 September 2000 at the Regent Hotel, when the Defendants\n\nasked Chow what was it that he wanted if he did not want the 3500 server, Chow merely replied,\n\n\"put something on the table\". The Defendants responded by telling him that they could not\n\ndo that because what they proposed could again be rejected. No one talked about the model of the\n\nserver. Lim Cher San believed that Chow must have felt the 3500 server could not do the job of\n\nhosting the website but he could not deduce that from what Chow was saying. If Chow had explained to\n\nthem in technical terms, perhaps they could have accepted his point. It was only after they had read\n\nthe Plaintiffs affidavits of evidence-in-chief that they realized Chow wanted something which was\n\nnot in the Settlement Agreement.104 Asked why XMT was charging the Defendants more than $17,000 for the things\n\nDigiland was supplying to XMT at $9,618, Lim Cher San said there was a mark-up for profit and for\n\nsetting up the hardware to be fully functional. Lim Cher San disagreed that the 1 August 2000\n\nQuotation/Confirmation Order from XMT to the Defendants was for a 5100 or higher-end server and not\n\nfor a 3500 server because the amount involved was much larger than XMTs purchase order of 24\n\nAugust 2000 to Digiland. Prices could have fluctuated between the two dates. Further, the items in\n\nthe two documents were not identical. The 1 August 2000 document had more items.105 Lim Cher San reiterated in re-examination that at the 20 September 2000\n\nmeeting from which Chow stormed out, Chow never mentioned any of the following:(1) hot swap capability;(2) no down-time;(3) 24-hours accessibility or availability;(4) 5100 server; and(5) 3500 server.106 The final witness for the Defendants was Alvin Teo, the Chief Technical\n\nOfficer, who negotiated with Chow from the outset. They agreed on the price of $43,000 for the\n\nDefendants to develop mixtown.com. The Plaintiffs paid a 30% deposit in August 1999. Alvin Teo would\n\nbe in charge of the technical aspects of the website. According to him, $43,000 was a steal for the\n\nPlaintiffs as he was trying to establish the Defendants in the technology market.107 Despite discussions about putting the details of the project in writing and\n\nalthough Chow engaged lawyers (Tan Peng Chin & Partners) to prepare the contractual documents,\n\nnothing was eventually signed by the parties.108 Work started in August 1999 up to the end of June 2000. The project\n\nencountered delays making Chow very unhappy. Alvin Teo attributed the delays to factors such as the\n\nPlaintiffs making numerous changes in product categories throughout the period of development of the\n\nwebsite, the Plaintiffs evolving ideas about the website and the fact that they were sometimes\n\nnot able to furnish the requisite information sufficiently quickly. The delays were also contributed\n\nto by the Defendants lack of staff.109 Being a new player in the market, Alvin Teo decided to please and appease the\n\ncustomer to the best of his ability. He was concerned about Chows complaints and hints at wanting\n\nto take legal action. Not wanting that to happen, he assured Chow that whatever his grievances were,\n\nthe Defendants would compensate the Plaintiffs to their satisfaction, putting aside the question of\n\nwhether the grievances were justified.110 On 14 June 2000, Emily Lim emailed to say that the Plaintiffs were looking\n\nforward to the completion and inspection of the website on 23 June 2000. That was the deadline set\n\nby Chow. On 15 June 2000, Alvin Teo discussed with Chow the terms of the Defendants offer of\n\ncompensation. Alvin Teo proposed that the Defendants host and maintain the website for 12 months at\n\nno extra costs from 23 June 2000, migrate it to a new independent Intel-based machine with Linux,\n\nwaive all outstanding sums due from the Plaintiffs and help the Plaintiffs source for advertisers.111 On 19 June 2000, Alvin Teo and Lim Cher San met Chow at 9 pm at the\n\nShangri-La Hotel. In preparation for that meeting, he drafted a Settlement Agreement and emailed it\n\nto Chow at 5.32 pm. Since Chow had wanted to know how much the offer was worth in monetary terms,\n\nAlvin Teo provided estimates of the value of the various items in the proposal. The total package\n\nwas worth some $95,200. At the meeting, Chow made known his displeasure with the website and spoke\n\nabout a rebuild. Alvin Teo then informed Chow that there was now another platform called Cold Fusion\n\nand proposed that after the completion and launch of the website, the Defendants could start work to\n\nrebuild the website on the Cold Fusion platform.112 Alvin Teo agreed with Chow to do a rebuild of the website as part of the\n\nsettlement. He was prepared to do so without charge to please the Plaintiffs. They agreed that the\n\nUAT be conducted on 23 June 2000 and the original website proceed with its launch on 1 July 2000. By\n\nthe end of the meeting, the Defendants offer was to provide $90,000 worth of maintenance\n\nservices, a webpage design revamp service worth $25,000, to assist in selling $100,000 worth of\n\nPacific Internet banner advertisements, to waive the balance amount due and to provide $25,000 worth\n\nof credit for any web development services to be provided by the Defendants.113 As Alvin Teo was leaving for Bandung on 20 June 2000, he asked Lim Cher San\n\nto email to Chow the above terms. That was done in the evening of 20 June 2000.114 That was followed by the 22 June 2000 meeting between Ernest Eu and Lim Cher\n\nSan for the Plaintiffs and Chow and Emily Lim for the Defendants where the terms were modified\n\nfurther in the Plaintiffs favour.115 On 23 June 2000, the UAT was successfully done at the Plaintiffs office.\n\nAlvin Teo, Sherine Teo and Emily Lim were present at the UAT. The next day, the Defendants sent an\n\nemail to the Plaintiffs setting out the results of the UAT and the further actions required,\n\nincluding the \"clean up\" of the database. The Defendants then went about tidying up the\n\ncodes in readiness for the launch on 1 July 2000, not expecting anyone to access the website in the\n\nmeantime.116 On 26 June 2000, the Plaintiffs complained that the website was not working\n\nbecause registration could not be done. Surmising that the problem was probably due to the\n\n\"clean up\" being done or to the Plaintiffs using an older version of the Netscape browser,\n\nAlvin Teo called for a meeting on 28 June 2000 at the Plaintiffs office. On 27 June 2000, Chow\n\nagain complained about the registration problem.117 In the morning of 28 June 2000, Alvin Teo, Lim Cher San and Sherine Teo went\n\nto meet Chow and Emily Lim to explain to Chow about the \"problem\". However, Chow refused\n\nto listen to reason. He also did not want the website anymore and called off the launch scheduled\n\nfor 1 July 2000. Instead, he wanted the Defendants to focus their energies on the revamped website.\n\nAfter much discussion, the Defendants agreed to his demand that they provide him with a server of\n\nagreed specifications at the Defendants cost. This was despite the Defendants opinion that the\n\nwebsite could function as scheduled on 1 July 2000.118 On 29 June 2000, Alvin Teo emailed Chow the specifications of the server he\n\nwas recommending, a HP Netserver E60 with Intel Pentium III 550 Mhz. The next day, Chow replied that\n\nhe wanted either an IBM or Compaq server with two CPUs scalable to four CPUs with a speed of 733 or\n\n866 Mhz as 550 Mhz was already \"old\". It was finally agreed that the server should have\n\ntwo CPUs with a speed of 733 Mhz.119 In the course of settling the terms of the Settlement Agreement, Chow\n\ninsisted that Alvin Teo insert the value of the various items in the agreement so that he could\n\nconvince his management to approve the settlement package. According to Chow, he had earlier managed\n\nto obtain a compensation package from Pacific Internet of $200,000 worth of services. He said it\n\nwould help him in the obtaining of approval if he could show his management that the settlement was\n\nof substantial worth. Alvin Teo therefore arbitrarily inserted various amounts to make up the sum\n\nChow wanted with \"the only real figure\" being the $30,000 worth of computer hardware that\n\nthe Defendants agreed to give the Plaintiffs. The other figures were for \"internal\n\naccountability\" only.120 After a few more drafts, the Settlement Agreement was finally signed on 11\n\nJuly 2000.121 The ability of a website to perform electronic commerce required certain\n\ncomponents which varied in their performance. According to Alvin Teo, the components specified in\n\nthe Settlement Agreement \"were the best in performance bearing in mind not to overstretch the\n\nbudget and meeting the Plaintiffs requirements\".122 On 12 September 2000 (the day after the delivery of the 3500 server), Chow\n\ntelephoned Alvin Teo to say that he was not accepting the server and that he wanted to terminate the\n\nSettlement Agreement. On 14 September 2000, Chow spoke to him again and asked that the Defendants\n\nreimburse the Plaintiffs $30,000 in place of the server. Alvin Teo did not agree that would be\n\noutside the parameters of the Settlement Agreement. He informed Ernest Eu who then arranged the said\n\nbreakfast meeting on 20 September 2000 at the Regent Hotel.123 In cross-examination, Alvin Teo said the Defendants did advise the Plaintiffs\n\norally about the prohibition against commencing the project before the NCBs letter of offer was\n\nreceived where the application for the grant was concerned. However, because of the tight schedule\n\nof the project, both parties decided to go ahead notwithstanding the prohibition and the risk of\n\nforfeiting the grant.124 Asked about the \"real\" and \"unreal\" figures in the\n\nSettlement Agreement, Alvin Teo said he was more concerned at that time with the upfront payment. He\n\ndid not know the cost of the other items then but had \"plugged them in\" based on a rough\n\ngauge to make up the sum in the package that Chow requested. Chow did not suggest the individual\n\nfigures.125 Alvin Teo was referred to Chows email to him on 30 June 2000 which\n\nincluded the statement, \"Our main objectives include (1) (the more than one-year old simple\n\nrequest that) mixtown.com to work!\". Asked how Chow could be saying this if he had decided on\n\n28 June 2000 that he did not want the original website anymore, Alvin Teo replied that Chow was\n\nactually referring to the revamped website. There was in truth no version 1 or 2 of mixtown.com. The\n\nname of the website would remain the same even after the revamp.126 Alvin Teo repeated the point made by the Defendants other witnesses that\n\nthe first time they knew that Chow was alluding to hot swap capability was in the Plaintiffs\n\naffidavit of evidence-in-chief. If the Defendants had known this was the issue, they would have\n\nsuggested that the budget be used for third party solutions such as Escort which would allow hot\n\nswap capability to be added to the 3500 server with no compatibility problem. He disagreed with the\n\nPlaintiffs experts testimony that it was not possible to upgrade the 3500 server. The\n\nDefendants had incorporated hot swap capability to an IBM server in another project but that was not\n\na 3500 server. In that case (involving an IBM 4500 server), they had an external solution which\n\nallowed hot swap capability to be connected to the server via a SCSI cable, which the 3500 server\n\nalso had. Just because IBM did not recommend the 3500 server for Internet web-serving did not mean\n\nthat such a server could not be used for that purpose.127 Alvin Teo agreed that a factor affecting the ability of a website to perform\n\nelectronic commerce was the question of whether the website was operational continuously with\n\nminimum or no down-time. He accepted that a virtual shop like the mixtown.com website should ideally\n\nbe open 24 hours a day save for scheduled down-time.128 On the Raid 5 feature, Alvin Teo explained that it provided a fail-safe\n\nenvironment for data storage. At least three hard disks were required. Should one of them fail, the\n\nserver would still not be down. A down-time could then be scheduled to replace the failed hard disk.\n\nWhen that was done, the system would automatically regenerate the data from the failed hard disk\n\ninto the replacement. Without hot swap capability, the failed hard disk could not be replaced\n\nwithout shutting down the server. Should a second hard disk fail before the first was replaced, the\n\nwebsite would be down.129 It was the Defendants practice to shut down a server even if it had hot\n\nswap capability and this could be done during a period of low traffic in the website. It was\n\nadvisable to avoid pulling out one hard disk to replace it with another while the server was not\n\nturned off because that could cause arcing which could easily damage the Raid 5 controller and if\n\nthe Raid 5 controller failed, some data could be lost permanently. Therefore while hot swap\n\ncapability would be good to have, it was not an absolute necessity. However, Raid 5 was definitely\n\nnecessary.130 The Defendants paid for Tan Peng Chin & Partners services in preparing\n\nthe draft agreement although it was never signed between the parties as the Defendants felt partly\n\nresponsible for the delay by not going through it. There were discussions between the parties but\n\nsome clauses were not acceptable to the Defendants. Somehow nobody got down to having it formally\n\nsigned. There were still some blanks left in the draft agreement.131 The Settlement Agreements final specifications for the server came from\n\nChow who had been consulting the information technology professionals in the Plaintiffs parent\n\ncompany about the terms in the Settlement Agreement.132 In re-examination, Alvin Teo clarified that the third party solution called\n\nEscort, which would be able to perform a hot swap capability type of function, could be regarded as\n\nan add-on to the 3500 server and was not an upgrade in the sense that it was not an IBM solution.\n\nThe Escort solution required only a SCSI interface to work and the 3500 server did have such an\n\ninterface. The Escort solution would cost about $6,000 and could support more hard disks than the\n\n5100 server.133 The 3500 server was definitely a more powerful machine than the Sun System\n\nserver used for Gatecrash.com, which had apparently impressed Chow and which experienced no problem\n\nof crashing.134 With Raid 5 on board, should a hard disk crash, replacement could wait until\n\na scheduled down-time when the server would be shut down and the failed hard disk replaced. The\n\nserver would then be turned on again and the website would again be functioning. The whole process\n\nwould take less than half an hour.135 Alvin Teo had experienced hard disk failure only two or three times within\n\nthe same machine since 1992. He had never encountered a situation of two hard disks failing\n\nsimultaneously nor crashing one after the other in his nine years of experience. He reiterated that\n\nthe 3500 server could host a website 24 hours with no down-time save for scheduled ones. The 48\n\nhours provided in the Settlement Agreement to recover the server was more than sufficient for the\n\n3500 server.THE DECISION OF THE COURT136 It was self-evident that the Settlement Agreement of 11 July 2000 was\n\nintended by the parties to encapsulate all their rights and obligations arising from the rather\n\nunhappy relationship over the previous 13 months. It was to be the \"final settlement\" and\n\n\"henceforth, neither party shall have any further claims from either party or whatsoever\".\n\nIt did not incorporate any previous agreement by reference. The rights and obligations of the\n\nparties must therefore be construed within the parameters of the Settlement Agreement. Such an\n\napproach would be in accordance with Sections 93 and 94 of the Evidence Act.137 Further, as the Settlement Agreement was forged on the anvils of both\n\nparties, I did not think that thecontra proferentumrule of construction could apply here.\n\nThere were proposals and counter-proposals and many discussions leading to the final document. It\n\nwould be highly artificial to apply the said rule of construction to a particular clause simply\n\nbecause it was first mooted by one or the other party. Both had added, altered or subtracted the\n\ningredients over several weeks and it would be only reasonable to consider both parties as the cooks\n\nwho had prepared the final concoction that appeared on 11 July 2000. After all, the Plaintiffs did\n\nconsult others on the terms of the Settlement Agreement, notably personnel from the Plaintiffs\n\nparent company.138 It should also be noted that whatever documents that had passed between the\n\nparties before 11 July 2000 were never formally executed for some reason or other and appeared to be\n\nstill malleable.139 It was not in dispute that the 3500 server did meet the specifications listed\n\nin paragraph (a) of the Settlement Agreement with the Defendants having indicated to the Plaintiffs\n\nthat the items delayed would be delivered towards the end of September 2000. The complaint was not\n\nabout such items in any event but about the lack of hot swap capability.140 Chow said that the Defendants had mentioned hot swap capability or words to\n\nthat effect but curiously there was no hint of that term whatsoever in the Settlement Agreement. It\n\nmay be that there were many other things to consider but that did not prevent those many other\n\nthings from finding their way into the Settlement Agreement. It was incredible that something so\n\nimportant to the Plaintiffs would be overlooked by them over the several weeks of negotiations. It\n\nwas clear from the evidence that the term \"hot swap capability\" made its debut in this\n\ndispute only when the Plaintiffs affidavits of evidence-in-chief were filed. Chow did not even\n\nhint about it at the disastrous meeting of 20 September 2000 at the Regent Hotel.141 The Plaintiffs could not have intended hot swap capability to be an essential\n\nfeature of the server. Paragraph (h) of the Settlement Agreement contemplated the Defendants having\n\nto resolve any malfunction in the server within 48 hours of a complaint from the Plaintiffs. The\n\nparties agreed, quite fairly, that the Defendants would not be responsible for down-time caused byforce\n\nmajeure, which meant that in the event of down-time (whether it exceeded 48 hours or not) caused\n\nby factors beyond the control of the Defendants, the Defendants would not be held accountable. In\n\nany other case of unscheduled down-time, if the Defendants failed to get the server and hence the\n\nwebsite operating within the said 48 hours, that would be considered \"strike one\". If the\n\nDefendants failed in this manner a second time, the Plaintiffs would be at liberty to change the\n\nhosting company at the Defendants expense because, in the graphic sports language of Chow,\n\n\"two strikes and youre out\".142 The Settlement Agreement therefore could not be read to have expressly or\n\nimpliedly provided for a non-stop website (save for scheduled down-time) because it obviously\n\nenvisaged unscheduled down-time with the attendant sanction already discussed above. That being the\n\ncase, there could be no question of importing hot swap capability as an essential feature of the\n\nserver to be provided by the Defendants.143 The 3500 server met the specifications in the Settlement Agreement and was\n\nalso capable of hosting the Plaintiffs website. IBMs recommendation of their 5100 server for\n\nweb hosting did not mean that they were advising against their 3500 server being used for such\n\npurpose. As accepted by the Plaintiffs, even an ordinary computer could perform that task. Of\n\ncourse, a hard disk crash was a possibility but that was not a likely event. Even if one hard disk\n\nfailed, the server could still continue to run without the danger of data loss. The failed hard disk\n\ncould then be replaced during a scheduled down-time say at 2 or 3 am when traffic was likely to be\n\nlow. Such replacement would not take more than 30 minutes. It would be extremely rare to have two\n\nhard disks crash simultaneously or one soon after the other.144 The Plaintiffs ought to have accepted the 3500 server and if subsequent\n\nevents proved the Defendants wrong and they \"struck out\" twice, the Plaintiffs would be\n\nprotected within the terms of the Settlement Agreement. I accepted the Defendants evidence that\n\nthe confusion surrounding the delivery orders was nothing more than an administrative error which,\n\nunfortunately, fuelled the Plaintiffs smouldering suspicion that their goose was being cooked.\n\nEven if the Defendants had down-graded their order from a higher-end IBM server to the 3500 server,\n\nso long as the one provided met the specifications, the Plaintiffs were in no position to insist on\n\nthe more expensive model. Section 4(5) Supply of Goods Act provides only for reasonable fitness for\n\nthe particular purpose and not for the best fit. The Plaintiffs had no valid reason for rejecting\n\nthe 3500 server.145 Even if the Plaintiffs could insist on hot swap capability, if Chow or Emily\n\nLim had only alluded to the feature by mentioning the term or describing its attribute, the\n\nDefendants could have easily accommodated their wishes by the \"Escort\" add-on. It was\n\nunfortunate and unreasonable of Chow to have left the Defendants trying to read his mind at the\n\nmorning meeting of 20 September 2000.146 It could not have been contemplated by the Settlement Agreement that the\n\nserver would have to be delivered and kept at the Plaintiffs premises. For the reasons given by\n\nthe Defendants, it was impractical and indeed nonsensical to have the server there. Chow was\n\nobviously testing the Defendants sincerity and ability by insisting on the hardware before the\n\nmore important intellectual content was ready. It was telling that he was not really issuing an\n\nultimatum by his email of 7 September 2000 for the Defendants to deliver the server or be in breach\n\nof the Settlement Agreement. He was actually informing them to deliver the server by 14 September\n\n2000 failing which they would have to provide \"another IBM model and specifications\" which\n\nthe Plaintiffs \"now wanted\". Nevertheless, the Defendants complied with the Plaintiffs\n\ndemands by 11 September 2000.147 I accepted the Defendants evidence on the events after the UAT on 23 June\n\n2000. The Defendants were not given the chance to explain or to rectify any registration problem\n\nencountered after 23 June 2000. I accepted that it was Chow who called off the 1 July 2000 launch\n\neven though there were mistakes made by the Defendants regarding the venue of the meeting and the\n\nidentity of one of the Defendants representatives. With so many meetings at diverse places and\n\nthe different permutations of persons in attendance at those meetings, errors like these could quite\n\nunderstandably be made honestly. I did not think that 28 June 2000 was a date materially different\n\nfrom their pleadings \"on or about 27 June 2000\". The events and the emails that\n\nfollowed that meeting and those after 1 July 2000 were entirely consistent with the launch of the\n\nwebsite having been postponed.148 The Defendants had performed their end of the bargain as at 20 September 2000\n\n(and in the case of delivering the server to the Plaintiffs premises, perhaps performed more than\n\ntheir obligations entailed). The Plaintiffs actions in wrongfully rejecting the 3500 server had\n\nresulted in the Defendants inability to carry out the rest of the Settlement Agreement. The\n\nPlaintiffs had therefore wrongfully repudiated the Settlement Agreement and I dismissed their claim\n\nagainst the Defendants accordingly.149 On the issue of costs, the Defendants had served an Offer to Settle under\n\nOrder 22A of the Rules of Court on the Plaintiffs offering an amount in settlement. Order 22A rule\n\n9(3) provides:\"(3) Where an offer to settle made by a defendant(a) is not withdrawn and has not expired before the disposal of the claim in\n\n    respect of which the offer to settle is made; and(b) is not accepted by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff obtains judgment not\n\n    more favourable than the terms of the offer to settle,the plaintiff is entitled to costs on the standard basis to the date the offer\n\n  was served and the defendant is entitled to costs on the indemnity basis from that date, unless\n\n  the Court orders otherwise.\"A fortiori, where the Plaintiff does not succeed in his claim at all, the\n\nsame costs consequences should follow. This was not disputed by the Plaintiffs. I therefore\n\ndismissed the Plaintiffs claim and ordered the Plaintiffs to pay the Defendants costs on the\n\nstandard basis up to the date of the service of the offer to settle and costs on the indemnity basis\n\nthereafter, with such costs to be agreed or taxed.Sgd:TAY YONG KWANGJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
