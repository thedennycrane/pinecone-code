        "PS : Please see invitation letter from PT BHAKTI INVESTAMA as well as the\n\n  attachment.\"": "14 On 24 February 2000, the Intervener purportedly wrote to the Second Defendant\n\nrequesting that a vote be taken, without informing the other Noteholders. The Second Defendant sent\n\na second letter dated 24 February 2000 to the Noteholders in the following terms:\"Ref : REKASARAN GROUP Noteholders Meeting on the 29thFeb 20001. This message is in addition to the earlier one that was sent via e-mail\n\n  through the abovementioned Fiscal Agents.2. Please take note that each Noteholder is only to be represented by one\n\n  person and no more.3. If the Noteholder does not confirm attendance by the 25thFeb\n\n  2000 deadline, along with proof of ownership of the Note/s concerned, then the said Noteholder\n\n  will not be allowed to attend the meeting.4. Besides the Proposal by Bhakti, no other matter will be discussed.5. Please send this message to the other Noteholders through Euroclear / Cedel.6. Thanks and best regards.\"No mention was made of any change in the position regarding voting.15 The meeting on 29 February 2000 was attended by 50.58% of the Noteholders by\n\nvalue. A vote was taken despite the clear statement to the contrary in the Second Defendants\n\nletter of 16 February 2000 and the protest by the other Noteholders present. Out of the 50.58%\n\npresent, only 69.2% voted in favour of the proposal. The Second Defendants notes of the meeting\n\ntherefore showed that only some 35% of all the Noteholders by value agreed with the proposal.16 Further, the said meeting and the voting procedure were not in accordance with\n\nthe contractual provisions. Each individual debt issuance programme and the provisions by which it\n\nwas governed must be considered individually and independently. Nevertheless, the Second Defendant\n\nand the Intervener considered in aggregate the total value of all the Notes issued by the Rekasaran\n\nGroup of companies when determining the quorum and taking the vote. The nature of the business to be\n\ntransacted at the meeting was also not properly notified to the Noteholders. In addition, there was\n\nnot the requisite quorum of not less than two thirds in nominal amount of the Notes for the time\n\nbeing outstanding. There was also note the requisite majority of 75% of the persons at the meeting\n\nvoting. To date, there was no evidence of any other party besides the Intervener who was interested\n\nin proceeding with the restructuring scheme.17 The restructuring scheme essentially required the Noteholders to give up their\n\nrights of immediate payment by the Second Defendant in exchange for MCPs periodic repayments over\n\na 10-year period. A summary of the scheme is found in the second affidavit of the Plaintiffs where\n\nthe deponent, the First Vice-President of the First Plaintiff, stated:\"13. Further, from a commercial view point, the Plaintiffs have\n\n  difficulties with the scheme. Broadly, as I understand it, the proposal scheme is for new notes to\n\n  be issued by MCP in exchange for notes issued by the Rekasaran Group, including that issued by the\n\n  1stDefendant. As I understand, the mechanics of the payment under the MCP notes are as\n\n  follows:(i) Central Asia Petroleum (\"CAP\") purportedly has (a) a 60%\n\n    shareholding in Mangaistaumunaigaz (\"MMG\"), a Kazakhstan company which purportedly has\n\n    a license to explore and operate oil and gas fields, and/or (b) a license agreement with MMG to\n\n    explore 60% of MMGs oil and gas fields (hereinafter \"the 1stStage\").\n\n    Whether CAP is, if at all, at present a shareholder or licensee of MMG or both is unclear.(ii) CAP has committed to spend a minimum of USD 4.1 billion over the term of\n\n    the 1stStage (see page 14 of the Profile which can be found at page 22 of Agustinus\n\n    Affidavit). CAP has also agreed to pay USD 100 million of MMGs debt. CAP expects to receive\n\n    dividends from its 60% stake in MMG and/or presumably to receive profits under its license\n\n    agreement with MMG (hereinafter \"the 2ndStage\").(iii) It appears it is intended that part of the dividends and/or profits\n\n    paid to or generated by CAP will be paid to MCP. MCP would in turn presumably use the funds\n\n    received for the payment of the proposed new notes issued by MCP (hereinafter \"the 3rdStage\"). It is unclear however what the exact mechanics of such payment to MCP is.\"18 The Plaintiffs could not accept the scheme for various reasons apart from the\n\nprocedural irregularities mentioned earlier. The Second Defendants letter of 16 February 2000 had\n\nindicated that the exchange would be in respect of new Notes to be issued by Rekasaran CB whereas\n\nMCP was introduced as the vehicle for issuance at the meeting itself. There was also a dearth of\n\ninformation for the Noteholders to properly assess the scheme. The viability of the scheme was not\n\nsupported by any independent financial assessments or audits and the only information provided came\n\nfrom the Second Defendant and the Intervener, both of whom were interested parties. CAPs profile\n\nwas only distributed to the Noteholders during the meeting. The principal features of the\n\narrangement also raised many doubts and questions which had not been answered. It appeared from the\n\ndocuments furnished that 37% of the shareholding in CAP was held by MCP beneficially for the Second\n\nDefendant. Why should MCP want to be involved in the scheme and undertake the obligations under the\n\nnotes to be issued? When all these were considered together with the surreptitious manner in which\n\nthe scheme was devised and then sought to be foisted on the Noteholders in the highly irregular way\n\nat the meeting, it was patently clear that there were serious doubts regarding thebona fidesof the restructuring scheme and the honesty of the Second Defendant and the Interveners.THE INTERVENERS CASE19 A. W. Handoyono, a Director of the Interveners, stated the following in his\n\nfirst affidavit supporting the Interveners present application:\"4. The Applicant, PT. Bhakti Investama Tbk, is a public-listed company\n\n  incorporated in the Republic of Indonesia. It is in the business of investment banking.5. As far as the Applicant is aware, the 2ndDefendants have\n\n  guaranteed various notes issued by PT Tripatrial Citra Sarana, PT Rekasaran Utama, Rekasaran BI\n\n  Ltd and Rekasaran CB Ltd (the \"Notes\") bearing the total amount of USD216,500,000 and\n\n  JPY6.842,000,000 (the \"Rekasaran Notes Issuance\"). The Applicant is the holder of the\n\n  notes as indicated at page 7 of Exhibit AWH-1.6. Thus, the Applicant holds notes in the aggregate sum of USD 116,500,000 and\n\n  JPY 2,654,303,124. This is approximately 40% of the Rekasaran Notes Issuance. I believe this makes\n\n  the Applicant the single largest beneficial owner of the Notes issued under the Rekasaran Notes\n\n  Issuance. Needless to say, the Applicant is an interested party in any proceedings which involve\n\n  the Rekasaran Notes Issuance, and which, may prejudice its rights thereto.7. Sometime in June of 1999, Mr Khan of the 2ndDefendants informed\n\n  me of the 2ndDefendants intention to restructure the Rekasaran Notes Issuance. The 2ndDefendants indicated that they wanted to arrange for fresh security for the Notes provided that\n\n  they would remove themselves as guarantors to the Notes. I was very concerned because of the\n\n  Applicants sizable interest in the Notes. I was informed that the security contemplated was in\n\n  the form of shares of Central Asia Petroleum (\"CAP\"), which owned oil fields in\n\n  Kazakhstan. I received a copy of CAPs profile, a copy of which is indicated at pages 8 to 24 of\n\n  Exhibit AWH-1.8. The Applicants management discussed the matter to determine whether it\n\n  would be able to accept the 2ndDefendants restructuring plan. By then we were aware\n\n  that China Trust Commercial Bank, also a holder of Notes under the Rekasaran Notes Issuance, had\n\n  commenced an action against Jasindo in Indonesia in or about August 1999, but failed to make\n\n  Jasindo liable on its guarantee. They were unable to recover any monies owing under their Notes.9. The Applicants management made the decision to support Jasindos offer\n\n  to procure new notes secured by CAP shares in return for the selling of the Notes to the 2ndDefendants. In fact, the Applicant arranged for a meeting to be held on 29 February 2000, for\n\n  other holders of the Notes (the \"Noteholders\") to discuss the restructuring plan. The\n\n  Applicant circulated an invitation to Noteholders to attend the meeting and placed a notice in the\n\n  International Herald Tribune to bring the meeting to the attention of any other Noteholders.10. At the meeting, the Applicant, through its representative Mr. Aswin Dewanto\n\n  Hadi Soemarto made it clear that the restructuring plan should be put to a vote. This was done and\n\n  the outcome was as follows: 69.2% of the outstanding Notes represented at the meeting voted in\n\n  favor of restructuring plan, whilst 50.58% of the outstanding Notes attended the meeting\n\n  (\"the Quorum\").The Exchange Offer11. On 14 August 2000, the 2ndDefendant placed a notice in the\n\n  Asian Wall Street Journal and the International Herald Tribune regarding its offer to purchase the\n\n  Notes and in consideration of the same, it would procure Mega Caspian Petroleum Ltd to issue new\n\n  notes (the \"Exchange Offer\"). A copy of this notice is indicated at page 25 of Exhibit\n\n  AWH-1. The same notice has been placed earlier on 10 August 2000 in \"Bisnis Indonesia\".\n\n  Noteholders who were interested in participating in the Exchange Offer had to contact the trustee\n\n  of the Exchange Offer, Bermuda Trust (Singapore) Ltd (\"Bermuda Trust\"), for copies of\n\n  the Trust Deed and Sale & Purchase Agreement.12. The Applicant, of course, indicated its intention to participate in the\n\n  Exchange Offer. On 2 October 2000, the Applicant wrote to Bermuda Trust to confirm the Applicants\n\n  intention to execute the Sale and Purchase Agreement. In Bermuda Trusts reply, they stated that\n\n  they have been served with a copy of the interim Injunction Order dated 15 September 2000 and were\n\n  unable to proceed with the Exchange Order. A copy of the Applicants letter dated 2 October 2000\n\n  and the reply of Bermuda Trust are at pages 26 to 28 of Exhibit AWH-1. I contacted Mr Khan about\n\n  the Injunction Order. He gave me a copy of the Injunction Order together with a letter from the\n\n  Plaintiffs solicitors, Tan Kok Quan Partnership stating that under the Injunction Order,\n\n  Bermuda Trust was prohibited from proceeding with the Exchange Order. A copy of the Injunction\n\n  Order and the letter from Tan Kok Quan Partnership dated 18 September 2000 and the Injunction\n\n  Order are at pages 29 to 45 Exhibit AWH-1.13. The Applicant instructed solicitors in Singapore to seek clarification on\n\n  the scope of the Injunction Order from the Plaintiffs and to liaise with the Plaintiffs to\n\n  facilitate the Exchange of the Applicants notes. Copies of the correspondence between the\n\n  Applicants solicitors Messrs Wong Thomas & Leong and the Plaintiffs solicitors are at\n\n  pages 46 to 52 of Exhibit AWH-1.14. The Plaintiffs position emerging from the letters from their solicitors\n\n  letters appears to be that the Exchange of the Applicants notes could amount to a contravention\n\n  of the Injunction Order. The Applicants solicitors therefore requested that the Plaintiffs vary\n\n  the Injunction Order to enable the Applicant to proceed with the exchange of its notes. The\n\n  Plaintiffs have not acceded to their request hence the Applicants have had to make the present\n\n  application.15. The Applicant being the beneficial owner of more than 50% of the Rekasaran\n\n  Notes Issuance should be entitled to proceed with the Exchange Offer if it decides that it is in\n\n  its best interest to do so. The scope of the Plaintiffs Injunction Order should be confined\n\n  strictly to its own notes and no aspect of it should prevent any other noteholders proceeding with\n\n  the Exchange Offer.\"20 In his second affidavit, the same Director of the Interveners said:\"2. I make this affidavit in response to the 2ndaffidavit of\n\n  Xavier Arnail.3. My responses to paragraph 3 to 6 of the said affidavit are as follows:-i) The applicant had decided to play an active role and take the initiative\n\n    in moving the exchange scheme suggested by the 2ndDefendants as there were\n\n    protracted negotiations between the 2ndDefendants and its Informal Creditors\n\n    Committee without any results. I believe that the 1stPlaintiff at least is a member\n\n    of this Committee.ii) The Applicant was told by 2ndDefendant in late 1999 that\n\n    negotiations had been going on for 18 months with no progress as the Committee was only\n\n    interested in conducting a special investigative audit on 2ndDefendant.iii) I believe that the Committee would have received information on the oil\n\n    fields in Kazakhstan during these negotiations but did not communicate any information to the\n\n    Applicant.iv) I do not understand the Plaintiffs complaints of the Applicants\n\n    request for a vote to be taken at the meeting on 29 February 2000 as the Applicants\n\n    advertisement of 11 February 2000 states that the person shall attend the meeting above, must\n\n    be given a proxy to vote . The Applicants letter to the 1stPlaintiffs dated\n\n    11 February 2000 has an attachment which again states the person attending the noteholders\n\n    meeting above must be given a proxy to vote \". Please refer to pages 157 to 265 of the 1staffidavit of Xavier Arnail. As such, it is totally unwarranted for the Plaintiffs to state that\n\n    there was not the remotest hint or indication whatsoever that the Applicant would require a\n\n    vote at the said meeting. Please refer to page 7 lines 13 to 15 of the 2ndaffidavit of Xavier Arnail.4. In response to paragraph 7 of the said affidavit, the Applicant had\n\n  instructed its solicitors to write to the 2ndDefendants solicitors to confirm that\n\n  they would still be willing to succeed. Annexed hereto and marked AWH-2 is the exchange\n\n  between the Applicants solicitors and the 2ndDefendants solicitors confirming\n\n  the 2ndDefendants would still be willing to proceed with the notes exchange with the\n\n  applicants.5. On paragraph 11 of the said affidavit which refers to paragraph 15 of my 1staffidavit, I would clarify that my reference to the figure of 40% in paragraph 6 of my 1staffidavit is the correct figure.6. As regards paragraph 12 of the affidavit under reply, I confirm that the\n\n  report had been prepared by the Applicant for distribution to the noteholder on 29 February 2000\n\n  based on information received by the Applicant from Woods Mackenzie, a well known oil and gas\n\n  consultancy firm.7. As regards paragraph 14 of the said affidavit, I would make the following\n\n  observations:-i) the late introduction of MCP is not significant in the scheme of things as\n\n    the Plaintiffs would have known of the asset proposed as collateral for the new notes for a\n\n    length of time before the meeting on 29 February 2000.ii) the Plaintiffs have not made any request for information or queries to\n\n    the Applicant that they now list at paragraph 14 of the said affidavit. The Applicant does not\n\n    know whether they made any queries of the Defendants. As I asserted earlier, the Applicants\n\n    belief is that the 1stPlaintiffs at least received information on the scheme and the\n\n    oil fields in Kazakhstan much earlier than the Applicant as it was a member of the 2ndDefendants Informal Creditors Committee so it would have had every opportunity to ask\n\n    whatever questions it chose to, to satisfy itself on the viability of the scheme.8. Lastly I exhibit marked AWH-3 correspondence exchange between the\n\n  Applicants solicitors and Bermuda Trust (Singapore) Limited which contains a signed copy of the\n\n  Mortgage of Shares made between the 2ndDefendants and Bermuda Trust (Singapore)\n\n  Limited.\"THE DECISION OF THE COURTWho may apply for discharge or variation of injunction21 An injunction may affect persons beyond the defendant in an action. Hence, it\n\nis not merely the defendant who can apply to discharge or vary an injunction. As Buckley LJ said inCretanor\n\nMaritime Co Ltd v Irish Marine Management Ltd[1978] 1 WLR 966 at 978:\"Where an injunction has been granted in an action which affects someone\n\n  who is not a party to the action, he can apply in the action for the discharge of that injunction\n\n  without himself being made a party to the action.\"It is also possible for the non-party to be made a party to the proceedings where\n\nnecessary.What may be the subject matters of variation22 Variation may be sought by an intervener to enable a defendant to pay back\n\nmoney, which the intervener has advanced to the defendant, in good faith in the ordinary course of\n\nbusiness (\"The Angel Bell\"[1980] 1 LLR 632). As Robert Goff J said in that case\n\n(at 636 column 1):\" the point of the Mareva jurisdiction is to proceed by stealth, to\n\n  pre-empt any action by the defendant to remove his assets from the jurisdiction. To achieve that\n\n  result the injunction must be in a wide form because, for example, a transfer by the defendant to\n\n  a collaborator in the jurisdiction could lead to the transfer of the assets abroad by that\n\n  collaborator. But it does not follow that, having established the injunction, the Court should not\n\n  thereafter permit a qualification of it to allow a transfer of assets by the defendant if the\n\n  defendant satisfies the Court that he requires the money for a purpose which does not conflict\n\n  with the policy underlying the Mareva jurisdiction.\"Obviously, an intervener would also be able to come to Court to set aside an\n\ninjunction obtained through the collusion of the plaintiff and the defendant if his interest has\n\nbeen affected.23 Similarly, a variation could be sought by a defendant in order to permit him\n\nto pay trade creditors in the ordinary course of business even though that would result in the\n\nplaintiff having nothing left to levy execution on. Mareva injunctions were not meant to improve the\n\nposition of the plaintiff in the event of insolvency (Admiral Shipping v Portlink Ferries Ltd[1984] 2 LLR 106).24 Variations may therefore be made to injunctions to permitbona fidetransactions to be carried out. As Kerr LJ said inGalaxia Maritime v Mineral import export[1982] 1 WLR 539, \"in this connection, it is crucial to bear in mind not only the balance of\n\nconvenience and justice as between plaintiffs and defendants, but above all also as between\n\nplaintiffs and third parties.\"25 In the present case, the Interveners were not one of the original Noteholders.\n\nIt would be a fair presumption to say that they purchased their Notes from the secondary market\n\naround 1999 at a substantial discount. They also appeared to be the principal party eager to see the\n\nfruition of the restructuring scheme and to have far greater access to the Second Defendants\n\nfinancial information than the other Noteholders. The restructuring scheme was also apparently put\n\ntogether by the Interveners and the Second Defendant without consulting the ICC.26 The restructuring scheme would result in the Second Defendant being released\n\nfrom its liabilities as guarantor and the Noteholders being given uncertain prospects of repayment\n\nover ten years. The other Noteholders were certainly not convinced that the scheme was viable in the\n\nfirst place. The roles of CAP and MCP raised many unanswered questions. The Second Defendant\n\nappeared to be giving up rights in one of its assets, CAP, in return for absolving itself from all\n\nliability. It must be remembered that the Plaintiffs had taken up the Notes issued by the First\n\nDefendant because they would be guaranteed by the Second Defendant, a state-owned insurer.27 In addition to the above substantive matters, there was the further issue of\n\nthe procedural impropriety in purportedly pushing the scheme through at the meeting of 29 February\n\n2000. Looking at the totality of the evidence adduced, one was left with serious doubts about thebona\n\nfidesof the Second Defendant and the Interveners as well as the scheme. One also could not help\n\nbut wonder what the real role of the Interveners was in this scheme particularly since the Second\n\nDefendant was aware of the injunction but has chosen not to do anything about it. It must be noted\n\nthat the Interveners, \"with the consent and agreement of\" the Second Defendant called for\n\nthe meeting of 29 February 2000 and appeared authorised to require other Noteholders to furnish\n\ninformation regarding their respective holdings. The Interveners seemed too eager, by their\n\napplication to vary the injunction, to set in motion the dubious restructuring scheme and, by such\n\nsubterfuge, affect the question of liability of the Second Defendant in the arbitration proceedings\n\nas all the Notes appeared to be considered by the Second Defendant globally and the purported\n\nresolution of 29 February 2000 was said to be binding on all the Noteholders.28 The Interveners solicitors also submitted that paragraph 3 of the\n\ninjunction should be set aside because the Plaintiffs had not shown that the Defendants had assets\n\nwithin the jurisdiction or that there was a risk of the assets being removed. They also alleged that\n\nthe Plaintiffs had failed to make full and frank disclosure. Since the Interveners were coming into\n\nthe picture on the ground that they had been \"inconvenienced as their freedom of action has\n\nbeen affected\", I did not think it proper that they should attempt to step into the shoes of\n\nthe Defendants in this way. Such objections should rightly be taken by the Defendants and not the\n\nInterveners and, as mentioned before, the Defendants did not seem to want to do anything about the\n\ninjunction.29 For the above reasons, I was not satisfied that this was an application taken\n\nout in good faith and therefore dismissed the Interveners application. I also ordered the\n\nInterveners to pay $8,000 costs to the Plaintiffs.",
