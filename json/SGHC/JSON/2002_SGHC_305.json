        "Evidence of the Victim (PW 19)": "4.        The\n\nVictim and B had been schoolmates and good friends in primary school. The Victim then went\n\nto [school] but stopped schooling in 2001 or thereabouts. She said she has a problem with\n\nher right knee and a steel wire had to be inserted into it but, in my view, that was not\n\nthe real reason for her dropping out of school. She claimed that there was some\n\nmisunderstanding between her and the school.5.        On\n\nthe first day of Chinese New Year, i.e 12 February 2002, the Victim had gone to the NTUC\n\nClub with her godbrother Jason Chua and B. Her godbrother’s friend Derek had also\n\ncame along. When they left in the early hours of the next morning, B shared a taxi with\n\nDerek. In the afternoon, B told the Victim that her boyfriend (meaning the Accused) had\n\nseen her with Derek, became jealous and slapped her. On hearing this, the Victim asked for\n\nthe phone number of B’s boyfriend. She called him and questioned him as to why he had\n\nhit B. At that time, she did not know that B’s boyfriend and the Accused were one and\n\nthe same person. The Accused did not say anything about hitting B. After this\n\nconversation, B told the Victim that her boyfriend had asked the Victim to call him\n\nwhereupon the Accused told the Victim that he had not hit B.6.        On\n\n15 February 2002, B and the Victim arranged to meet at Toa Payoh MRT Station at about 7pm.\n\nB told the Victim that she wanted to hand some items to a friend and she and the Victim\n\nthen walked to a nearby HDB flat. There they met a man who was the Accused. B introduced\n\nthe Accused as her friend, but not as her boyfriend, and said his name was\n\n‘Alvin’ or ‘Wu Ming’. The three of them then went to a hawker centre\n\nfor drinks. Subsequently the Victim left to join her parents at the NTUC Club. There she\n\ncalled B to join her and B agreed. However B went to the NTUC Club with the Accused. There\n\nthey met the Victim and her parents. During the night, the Victim danced with the Accused\n\nand B and at other times with the Accused only. At times she went off with the Accused.7.        On\n\n16 February 2002, B and the Accused again joined the Victim and her parents at the NTUC\n\nClub, although again the Victim did not expect the Accused to be present. She said B\n\nreferred to the Accused as her brother, although they were not related. Again, the Victim\n\ndid dance with the Accused and go off with him at times although she said she did not do\n\nso frequently. She said that there was an occasion during the night when the Accused\n\ngrabbed her arm and pulled her to a staircase when B and her were walking back from the\n\ntoilet. B was walking ahead of her. The Victim said the Accused started to say bad things\n\nabout B. The Victim said that the Accused told her that he was treating the Victim like a\n\nyounger sister and he also said this to her parents. The Victim denied that during the\n\nsecond night at the NTUC Club she had had sexual intercourse with the Accused.8.        On\n\n18 February 2002, the Victim agreed to meet B at the Lavender MRT station at about 7pm.\n\nAgain, B turned up with the Accused. They went to a nearby coffeeshop. A girlfriend of\n\nB’s was also with them. While they were there, the Accused and the Victim left the\n\nothers. According to the Victim, this was for about ten minutes when they went to buy\n\nsweets (NE 202). She denied that she and the Accused had gone up a block of flats and had\n\nhugged and kissed each other. Later that night, the Victim’s parents arrived to fetch\n\nher.9.        On\n\nor about 21 February 2002, B arranged to meet the Victim at Toa Payoh MRT station at about\n\n7pm. When the Victim arrived at about 7.15pm, she was surprised to see the Accused there\n\nalone. The Victim called B who said that she was at her boyfriend’s place and was\n\nhaving a stomach pain. B told her to go shopping with the Accused. The Victim and the\n\nAccused then walked around the neighbourhood shops in Toa Payoh. At about 8pm, the Victim\n\ncalled B who said she would not be meeting the Victim as she was not feeling well.\n\nHowever, the Accused told B to meet them behind Blk 60 in Toa Payoh. After B eventually\n\narrived, the Victim’s mother phoned and asked the Victim for her whereabouts. The\n\nVictim said she was with B who then spoke to the Victim’s mother. The Victim’s\n\nmother then asked the Victim to return home. The Accused accompanied her to the MRT\n\nstation. The Accused said he was going to meet a friend and asked the Victim if she would\n\nlike to accompany him. She declined. They both boarded the same train and the Victim\n\nalighted at her destination, Redhill, while the Accused carried on with his journey\n\npurportedly to meet his friend.10.        On\n\n25 February 2002 (the day of the alleged offences), the Victim received a call from B who\n\nasked the Victim if she would like to accompany her to see a monk as B had been having a\n\nstomach pain. The Victim agreed and they arranged to meet at between 2.30 to 3pm at\n\nLavender MRT station. However, about ten minutes later, B called claiming that she was\n\nhaving problems with her boyfriend and changed the meeting time to 7pm. At about 7pm, the\n\nVictim arrived at Lavender MRT station to see only the Accused there. The Accused told the\n\nVictim that he wanted to meet a friend at Lorong 23 Geylang and the Victim said she would\n\nnot accompany him as she wanted to wait for B. The Accused then changed his mind\n\nimmediately and said he would bring the Victim to see the monk first and B would meet them\n\nwhereupon the Victim called B. B told the Victim to follow the Accused to see the monk as\n\nthe Victim could ask the monk to help her with her knee problem. The Victim agreed.11.        \n\nFrom the Lavender MRT station, the Victim and the Accused took a taxi. The Victim heard\n\nthe Accused telling the driver to go to Mountbatten. Both of them were sitting at the rear\n\nand, during the journey, the Accused was telling the Victim about the monk’s healing\n\nprowess. The Accused also offered the Victim a packet drink of Chrysanthemum tea. She took\n\na few sips, felt giddy and returned the packet to the Accused. She also said that when the\n\nAccused gave her the packet drink, the straw had not already been poked into the foil\n\nopening (NE 223). The taxi arrived at a building which looked like a two-storey house.12.        The\n\nVictim said she was still feeling giddy. She sat down inside the building. In her\n\nstatement (paragraph 29), she said that she saw the Accused handing over something to a\n\nwoman behind a table and in return, the woman handed something to him. In\n\ncross-examination, she said she did not see the Accused take anything (NE 226). The Victim\n\nsaid the Accused opened the door next to where she was sitting and called her to follow\n\nhim which she did. From photographs, she identified the room as Room 119 in Sing Hoe\n\nHotel. She also said she could recognise the inside of the room and the toilet (NE 157).\n\nShe said the bed in the room was not made up and she saw rosary beads on a dressing table\n\nbut she did not see any robe (NE 232 and 234). The Accused left the room, came back with a\n\ncan of beer and went to the toilet attached to the room. She began to feel giddy again and\n\nwent to the door and opened it when the Accused came out from the toilet clad only in his\n\nunderwear. He then grabbed her arm, she struggled, he pushed the door shut and carried\n\nher. He then dropped her on a bed. She was stunned and did not realise that the Accused\n\nwas going to do something bad to her (NE 166 and 244). The Victim said she did not shout\n\nfor help because she did not realise what was happening until the Accused started to strip\n\nher (NE 166). She was frightened and shocked (NE 167). When the Accused was removing her\n\nclothing and she struggled and bit him on the right shoulder, he slapped her hard once on\n\nher left cheek. The Accused was having difficulty in penetration as the Victim was\n\nstruggling but she stopped struggling when he pressed his leg on her right knee and she\n\nfelt pain. As he was penetrating her, he kissed her breasts and sucked her nipples. She\n\nsaid she did not scream because she felt giddy (NE 238 line 1 and 22, NE 251 line 11 and\n\n22). However, she also said that she was not sure whether she had screamed (NE 252 line\n\n21, NE 253 line 6). She said that the situation was complex and she was unable to describe\n\nit very clearly (NE 252). She found the penetration painful and she was crying. She did\n\nnot consent to the Accused having sexual intercourse with her.13.        \n\nAfter the rape, the Accused carried her into the bathroom/toilet. She was still crying.\n\nShe turned on the shower to wash herself. The Accused told her that she now belonged to\n\nhim and that he owed someone money. If he were in trouble, she should help him. The\n\nAccused also told her that if she were to make a report, nobody would believe her as he\n\nhad a lot of friends in CID. He added that if he were to go to jail, he would not let the\n\nVictim or her parents off. The Victim said she believed him as she was afraid of him. They\n\nleft the building between 8.45pm and 9pm, walked for a while and got into a taxi. They\n\nwent to Bugis Junction and alighted. Before the Accused walked away, he warned her about\n\nwhat he had said in the room. He also told her she could stay with him when her parents\n\nfound out about the incident and scolded her. He claimed to have other girls of her age\n\nstaying at his place and B used to stay there. He told the Victim that if she went to the\n\npolice, he would tell B to lie against her.14.        \n\nParagraphs 42 and 43 of the Victim’s statement stated:‘42. In the train, on the\n\n    way back home, I called B and asked her why she did not turn up to meet me at the place.\n\n    She told me that she was having stomach pain. She then asked me what we had done at the\n\n    place. I did not say anything to her. She then asked me if the accused had done anything\n\n    to me. I kept quiet. A short while later, I asked her if she had planned this with the\n\n    accused. Initially, she did not say anything but she then started to cry and asked me to\n\n    forgive her. She told me that the accused had forced her to follow his instructions. I\n\n    asked her why she had to listen to him and she told me that she did not have any choice as\n\n    he had done the same thing to her before.43. I told her that I wanted to\n\n    make a Police report but B told me not to do so. She told me that the accused would never\n\n    let me go if I make a Police report. She also told me that she would be in trouble with\n\n    the accused.’15.        The\n\nVictim also said that on the same night after the incident, the Accused had asked her to\n\ncall him at about 11pm as his mobile phone battery was running low. She said she did as\n\ndirected as she was afraid of him. She called him and he warned her against reporting the\n\nmatter to the police. He also asked her to call him everyday to tell him about her daily\n\nactivities which she agreed.16.        \n\nSome days later, on the night of 3 March 2002, the Victim told her mother what had\n\nhappened as her mother had questioned her about her change in behaviour. Her mother then\n\nconfronted the Accused on the telephone and the Victim claimed she could hear the Accused\n\nextorting $50,000 from her mother.17.        On\n\n4 March 2002, the Victim made a police report about the rape. The report stated that she\n\nwas raped by a male Chinese aged about 25 years at an unknown hotel along Mountbatten\n\nRoad.18.        The\n\nVictim also wrote down several messages she received on her handphone between 1 to 6 March\n\n2002 (Exhibit P24). The messages were from the following numbers:(a) 94888987 (the Accused’s\n\n    handphone number)(b) 90172562 (B’s handphone\n\n    number)(c) 90843032 (a number which the\n\n    Victim was not familiar with)(d) 98765305 (a number which the\n\n    Victim was not familiar with)94888987 was the number that B\n\nhad provided to the Victim when the Victim first called B’s boyfriend to question him\n\nas to why he had slapped B. B had also told the Victim to call her at this number when the\n\nVictim wanted to reach B.19.        \n\nMost of the messages were threatening, abusive and/or vulgar. One was from B stating that\n\nshe wanted to ‘chap’ the case, meaning she wanted to get involved in the matter.\n\nThe message also stated that she would be ‘his witness’.20.        It\n\nwas after the alleged offences that the Victim learned from the Investigating Officer that\n\nB’s boyfriend was actually the Accused (NE 344). The Victim had never regarded the\n\nAccused as her boyfriend but an elder brother (NE 184 and 181, 295).",
        "Evidence of B (PW 20)": "21.         B\n\nhad been staying with her grandmother and uncle since Secondary One. Her mother had passed\n\naway and her father was often in Thailand. When her father is back in Singapore, he stays\n\nalone and refuses to let her stay with him. She has one elder brother but he is not\n\nstaying with her and is staying with a cousin.22.         B\n\nhad known the Victim in primary school. She said that the Accused was her boyfriend in\n\n2002. B had gotten to know the Accused by talking to him on a phone chat line in January\n\n2002. He had asked her who she was living with and about her parents and she had told him.\n\nOn the following occasion, she asked the Accused to go out with her. She met him at his\n\nhome. When they were out together, the Accused said he would take care of her and asked\n\nher to be his girlfriend. The Accused also asked B to stay with him and, initially, she\n\ndeclined as she was schooling. However, as the Accused kept pressing her, she agreed. She\n\nstopped going to school thereafter.23.         B\n\nsaid that the Accused had one handphone but many SIM cards. He liked to use different SIM\n\ncards to make fun of people. What she meant was that he would send SMS messages of a\n\nvulgar or abusive nature to others or make phone calls and ending the calls. She knew this\n\nas he had done so in her presence and showed her the SIM cards (NE 390 and 391).24.         B\n\ncorroborated the Victim’s evidence that she (B) had gone out with the Victim and her\n\ntwo male friends on the night of the first day of Chinese New Year i.e 12 February 2002\n\nand that the Accused had seen her with one of the male friends, became angry with her and\n\nslapped her five times. That was the first time he had beaten her.25.        She\n\ncalled the Victim on the third day of Chinese New Year i.e 14 February 2002 and told her\n\nwhat her boyfriend had done. The Victim then asked for the boyfriend’s phone number.\n\nB gave the Victim the Accused’s mobile phone number and the Victim called the\n\nAccused.26.        \n\nAfter the Victim had spoken to the Accused, the Accused called and questioned B as to why\n\nshe had given his mobile phone number to the Victim and why she had told the Victim that\n\nhe had slapped her. The Accused was not happy and warned B not to tell anyone about the\n\nincident otherwise he would beat her again. However, the Accused also told B that he\n\nwanted to get to know the Victim.27.        On\n\nthe next day, i.e 15 February 2002, the Victim called B to ask B to go out with her. The\n\nAccused learned that B was making plans to go out with the Victim. In paragraph 5 of her\n\nstatement, B said:‘…. After that phone\n\n    call, the accused asked me whom I had called and I told him that it was the victim. I also\n\n    told him that I wanted to go out with the victim. The accused then reminded me of his\n\n    intention to bring a girl to work in a KTV lounge, he then said that he wanted to meet the\n\n    victim. I knew that he wanted to get the victim. Prior to this, the accused had told me of\n\n    his intention to get girls to work in KTV Lounge in order to earn some money. He also told\n\n    me he had used the phone chat line to get to know girls so that he could sweet talk them\n\n    into working at the KTV Lounge.’28.        The\n\nAccused also told B to arrange to meet the Victim. He would come along but she was not to\n\ntell the Victim. B was also not to tell the Victim his real name but to introduce him as\n\nAlvin or Wu Ming. B agreed because she was afraid of the Accused. Eventually B met the\n\nVictim at Toa Payoh MRT station and then brought her to meet the Accused at a nearby flat.\n\nThey then went for drinks at a hawker centre. Subsequently that night, the Victim asked B\n\nto go to the NTUC Club as her mother wanted to meet B. B reluctantly agreed as the Accused\n\nwanted to meet the Victim again. B and the Accused then went to the NTUC Club and met the\n\nVictim and her parents. The Victim and the Accused left the table from time to time and\n\nwere at times dancing together.29.        On\n\nthe following morning, i.e 16 February 2002, the Accused told B that he had chosen the\n\nVictim to work in a KTV lounge. He wanted her to ‘date’ the Victim on his\n\nbehalf. She agreed because the Accused threatened to beat her if she refused. That night,\n\nthe Accused told B to call the Victim as he wanted to meet her. Eventually B arranged to\n\nmeet the Victim at the NTUC Club again where the Victim would be with her parents.30.        \n\nAgain, the Accused and the Victim left the group from time to time and at times were\n\ndancing together. However, B said that on one occasion, the Accused had asked the\n\nVictim’s mother for permission to go out with the Victim but the mother told him he\n\ncould not unless B was around. The Victim remained silent.31.        In\n\nparagraph 21 of B’s statement, she gave an account as to what happened after the\n\nAccused and her left the NTUC Club that night. She said:‘21. Both the accused and I\n\n    took a taxi for his house. In the taxi, the accused told me that the victim’s mother\n\n    was a ‘smart’ woman who could talk very well. When we reached his house, the\n\n    accused told me of a plan where he wanted me to call the victim and arrange a meeting at a\n\n    certain place. I was also told to tell the victim that I would be meeting her with the\n\n    accused but in actual fact, I was not supposed to go and meet the victim at all. The\n\n    accused would be there to meet her on his own. He then told me that he would get the\n\n    victim to work in a KTV Lounge so that he could make some money. He also mentioned that he\n\n    would try to get the victim to have sex with him, so that she would love and be with him\n\n    and since the victim was very attached to her mother, he would try to make her run away\n\n    from home. I would like to say that I began to hate the accused for what he wanted to do\n\n    but I dared not tell him that I would not help him. I was afraid that he would beat me and\n\n    at that time, I dared not leave him due to the same reasons. He also added that once he\n\n    got the victim to work in the KTV Lounge, he would get the money where he would bring me\n\n    with him to Thailand. He claimed that he had a friend who had done the same thing before,\n\n    his friend became successful and now his friend was in Thailand with his girlfriend. He\n\n    then told me that he had already told someone to make passports for both of us. I did not\n\n    ask him why he got someone to make passports for us. After the conversation, both of us\n\n    went to sleep.’32.        On\n\nanother occasion, B arranged to meet the Victim at Lavender MRT station. The Accused was\n\nalso present. They then went to a coffeeshop and talked. Another girlfriend was with B. B\n\nsaid that the Accused and the Victim went off on their own for about an hour before\n\njoining B and her friend. Later in the night, the Victim’s parents came to fetch her\n\nto the NTUC Club. B said that the Accused had told her that when he was alone with the\n\nVictim, he had put his finger into her vagina.33.        On\n\nanother occasion, the Accused told B to arrange to meet the Victim at Toa Payoh at about\n\n7pm but he would meet the Victim alone and B was to stay in the Accused’s flat. At\n\nabout 8pm, the Victim called B and asked why she did not turn up. B said she had a stomach\n\nupset and would meet them later. Later, the Accused called and told B to go to Blk 60 Toa\n\nPayoh. B said when she met the Victim, the Victim was a bit angry. The Victim’s\n\nmother had called the Victim and the Victim had to lie that she was with B (as B had not\n\narrived yet but the Accused had). The Victim asked B to call her mother and lie to her\n\nthat B had gone to a toilet.34.        \n\nParagraph 29 of B’s statement stated that the Accused told her to go back while he\n\nsent the Victim to the MRT station. Paragraph 30 stated:‘30. Later the accused\n\n    returned home and told me that he might not be successful in getting the victim to work in\n\n    KTV because her mother was very strict, always keeping an eye on her daughter. He then\n\n    told me that if he managed to get the victim to work in the KTV, he suspected that her\n\n    mother would make a police report and the Police would arrest him. He told me that he\n\n    would mention my name to the Police and I must be on his side to lie to them. He told me\n\n    that he would mention my name to the Police because the victim was introduced to him by\n\n    me.’35.         B\n\ncould not remember the date of the alleged rape. However she said that the Accused had\n\nasked her to call the Victim. She then called the Victim to say that she was having a\n\nstomach pain and wanted to seek treatment from a monk at a temple. She told the Victim\n\nthat she should come along because of her knee problem (NE 474). As directed by the\n\nAccused, she told the Victim to meet her at Lavender MRT station. The Accused had also\n\ntold B not to turn up as he wanted to meet the Victim alone. If the Victim should call B,\n\nshe was to lie to say that her boyfriend was not well and she had to take care of him and\n\nthe Victim was to follow the Accused. The Accused left his flat at about 5 or 6pm.36.         B\n\nsaid that the Victim did call her subsequently on the same day to ask why she had not\n\nturned up. She told the Victim that her boyfriend was not well and she had to take care of\n\nhim. She told the Victim to follow the Accused.37.        \n\nLater in the same night, the Victim called B again. In paragraph 33 of her statement, B\n\nsaid the Victim asked her whether she had planned ‘it’ with the Accused but the\n\nVictim did not specifically say she had been raped. According to B, the ‘it’\n\nmeant that the Accused wanted to cheat B (NE 564 and 565). B said she cried and told the\n\nVictim that she had been forced by the Accused to do it. During the trial, B elaborated\n\nthat she cried because she knew something had gone wrong (NE 565).38.        In\n\nthe rest of paragraph 33, B said she told the Victim not to make a report as the Accused\n\nwould not let B go and B would get into trouble with the police and the Accused. The\n\nAccused would take revenge on B.39.        \n\nWhen the Accused returned home that night, B asked him what he had done with the Victim\n\nbut he did not tell her. He looked fierce and stared at B who decided not to ask him\n\nfurther (paragraph 36 of B’s statement).40.         B\n\nsaid that about two days later, the Accused told her that he wanted to make a police\n\nreport about an attempt to extort money from him (NE 493). However she was not sure about\n\nthe date. The Accused told her that the Victim’s mother was trying to extort money\n\nfrom him because of ‘that matter’ meaning the day when the Accused had\n\npurportedly brought the Victim to a hotel (NE 495). B also said that the Victim’s\n\nmother had told her that the Accused had brought the Victim to a hotel (NE 499).41.         B\n\nsaid that when she accompanied the Accused to make a report to the police, the Accused\n\ntold her to lie to the police and say he was drunk and did not know what he was doing. He\n\nalso told her to lie that he had been wrongly accused of bringing the Victim to a hotel\n\n(paragraph 37 of B’s statement). However, in cross-examination, she said that up till\n\nthen she did not know that the Accused had had sexual intercourse with the Victim. All he\n\nhad told her was that he had put his finger into the Victim’s vagina (NE 502) at the\n\ntime when they met in a coffeeshop with B’s girlfriend.42.         B\n\nalso said that she and the Accused had sent the various abusive and threatening SMS\n\nmessages which the Victim had mentioned. One was from the Accused’s mobile phone\n\nnumber 94888987, one from her mobile phone number 90172562 and most were with the use of\n\nthe Accused’s Hi card with telephone number 90843032 (NE 423 and 539). However, she\n\ndid not recognise the fourth number 98765305.43.        One\n\nof the messages sent by B was the one I have mentioned i.e that she wanted to\n\n‘chap’ the matter and be ‘his witness’. According to paragraph 38 of\n\nB’s statement, she said that on that day, the Accused kept on telling her to be the\n\nAccused’s witness and that she was not to change her statements, otherwise he would\n\ngo to jail. He warned B that if her statement was the same as the Victim’s, he would\n\ngo to jail but upon his release, he would look for them.",
        "Evidence of Ms Ong Siew Hong\n\n(PW17)": "44.        The\n\nprosecution adduced evidence from Ms Ong Siew Hong (PW 17) who had worked as a chambermaid\n\nand front office clerk at Sing Hoe Hotel. She performed front office clerk duties every\n\nMonday, such as registration of guests. 25 February 2002 was a Monday. She resigned from\n\nthe hotel in or about May 2002. She was unable to recognise or remember the Accused or the\n\nVictim (NE 113, 114 and 122 to 124). She said that on that day, she did not notice any\n\nlady who had come into the hotel and was giddy (NE 118). Neither did she remember any\n\nshouting. She said she did not see a lady and a man coming out from Room 119 at about 9pm.\n\nShe confirmed that there was a refrigerator in front of the registration desk and it would\n\nhave soft drinks and beer (NE 115 and 116).",
        "Evidence of Ong Kum Fatt (PW 19)": "45.        The\n\nprosecution adduced evidence from Mr Ong Kum Fatt, the manager of Sing Hoe Hotel. Mr\n\nOng’s evidence was that the hotel had a Guest Room Record (like P22) and a\n\nRegistration Book (P23). The Guest Room Record was a booklet of chits of paper in which\n\nthe name, identity card number and nationality, room number, number of hours, cash, time\n\nIN and OUT would be recorded. These chits of paper are used when guests intend to occupy a\n\nroom for less than two hours. There are two copies, an original and a duplicate for each\n\nchit. The hotel would keep one copy and perhaps the other as well if the guest did not\n\nwant the other copy. Whatever the hotel kept would be from one to a maximum of two months.\n\nOnce the accounts had been checked, the chits of paper would be thrown away.46.        The\n\nguests who booked rooms for less than two hours would usually be allowed to use a room on\n\nthe first level (where Room 119 was) unless all the rooms on the first level were occupied\n\nin which case they would be allowed to use a room on the second level.47.        The\n\nparticulars of guests who booked rooms for more than two hours would be recorded in the\n\nGuest Registration Book. The Accused’s name was not recorded in the Book.48.        Mr\n\nOng also said that there were eight Closed Circuit Colour Television cameras installed in\n\nthe hotel at the material time. One was directed at the front of the reception. However,\n\nthe tapes would be kept for about 30 days, as one would be used for each day of the month,\n\nand then reused.49.        It\n\nis common ground that the Victim’s report to the police was made about seven days\n\nafter the alleged offences. Thereafter the police did not commence investigations until\n\nlater. Subsequently, they brought the Victim to hotels in Geylang first and then to\n\nMountbatten Road when she identified the hotel in question. By that time, the hotel no\n\nlonger had the tape recordings for 25 February 2002.",
        "Evidence of C (PW 21)": "50.        C\n\nis the mother of the Victim. In paragraph 9 of her statement, she claimed that from the\n\nday after the Victim was supposed to see the monk, she noticed the Victim taking showers\n\nfrequently and she kept changing her panties. She asked the Victim and the Victim said her\n\nvagina kept bleeding. In oral testimony, C said that it was more like spotting.51.        C\n\nalso said in her statement that the Victim kept on looking at her mobile phone and was not\n\nherself. In oral testimony, she also said the Victim became very worried and hot tempered\n\n(NE 586).52.        On\n\n3 March 2002, she and her husband had brought the Victim to her favourite restaurant for\n\ndinner. The Victim did not have any appetite. When questioned, the Victim began to cry.\n\nThat night, she asked the Victim what had happened and she broke down and told C that the\n\nAccused had raped her on the day she was supposed to see the monk i.e 25 February 2002.\n\nShe then confronted the Accused over the phone but she claimed that the Accused said that\n\nthe Victim had sex with him willingly and that he had threatened to expose all the\n\npictures he had taken, when he was having sex with the Victim, if C went to the police.\n\nThe Accused then sought $50,000 from C if she wanted to settle the matter. She denied\n\nattempting to extort $50,000 from the Accused.",
        "Evidence of Loy See Mua (PW 22)": "53.        The\n\nprosecution adduced evidence from Loy See Mua (PW 22). He said he had known the younger\n\nbrother of the Accused for about five to six years. The younger brother was known to him\n\nas ‘Or Lang’ and he and ‘Or Lang’ were staying in Toa Payoh. He had\n\nbeen to ‘Or Lang’s’ residence twice when ‘Or Lang’ was staying at\n\nBlk 58 Toa Payoh Lorong 4 and once when ‘Or Lang’ was staying at Blk 64 Toa\n\nPayoh Lorong 4. He knew the Accused as ‘Johnny Boy’. Loy said that in September\n\n2001, he had bought a Hi card from Singtel with the telephone number 90843032 as he did\n\nnot have any SIM card for his mobile phone. He used the name Loy Pitt to purchase the Hi\n\ncard. In December 2001, he was at the Accused’s flat at Blk 58 Toa Payoh to talk to\n\nOr Lang. When he was about to leave, the Accused asked him to apply for an SIM card as the\n\nAccused was still owing a service provider some money. Loy did not want to do so as he was\n\nafraid that he might end up footing the bills for the Accused’s use of the SIM card.\n\nInstead, he let the Accused have the Hi card because by then his friend Kelvin Lim had\n\nsubscribed for two SIM cards for him (Loy) and he did not have any more use for the Hi\n\ncard.54.        \n\nAlthough Loy was able to identify the Accused, he was not able to recognise B. Neither was\n\nB able to recognise him. Loy denied that the Hi card was actually given to B. He also said\n\nhe did not know Victim.",
        "Evidence of Dr Yong Tze Tein (PW\n\n4)": "55.        Dr\n\nYong Tze Tein (PW4) was attached to the Department of Obstetrician & Gynaecology of\n\nSingapore General Hospital. She examined the Victim on 4 April 2002 (NE 45) and her report\n\nwas dated 25 April 2002. Her examination of the Victim revealed that there were old\n\nhymenal tears at 4 and 8 o’clock. She was not able to say how recent they were or\n\nwhether force had been used. She also could not say whether the Victim had had intercourse\n\nmore than once. She did not find any injury on the genital area. She did not recall\n\nnoticing any teeth marks on the Victim’s breasts. She also noticed a visible scar on\n\nthe Victim’s right knee. The Victim had told her this was from a knee operation.",
        "Evidence of Dr Andre Leong (PW 3)": "56.        Dr\n\nAndre Leong (PW 3) was a Medical Officer at Changi Prison Hospital. He examined the\n\nAccused on 17 April 2002. He was asked to do a Penile Erectile Test on the Accused. He\n\nconcluded that clinically, there was no indication of impotence. He did not notice any\n\nbite mark or bruise mark on the Accused’s shoulder. His case notes stated that the\n\nAccused was ‘Aggressive, uncooperative’. The Accused was asked to ejaculate but\n\nhe did not.",
        "Evidence of Staff Sergeant Chia\n\nBeng Ho Bernard (PW 16)": "57.        \n\nStaff Sergeant Chia Beng Ho Bernard (PW 16) was attached to Toa Payoh Neighbourhood Police\n\nCentre. On 4 March 2002 at about 11.55am, he was doing desk duty at Toa Payoh NPP. The\n\nAccused and B had walked up to him then and the Accused informed him that he wanted to\n\nmake a report about a case of extortion. S/Sgt Chia said he asked the Accused how this had\n\ncome about and the Accused said that he had been to a pub with his girlfriend who was\n\nintroduced by B. After a couple of drinks, they were both drunk i.e the Accused and his\n\ngirlfriend (meaning the Victim). Both of them went to a place and they stayed together\n\nuntil the next morning. The Accused did not say exactly which place. When the Accused woke\n\nup, the Victim was still with him and he asked her to leave. A few days later, he received\n\na call from B who told him that the Victim’s mother had called her (B) and asked for\n\n$50,000 as the Victim was pregnant and underage (NE 81 to 82).58.        \n\nS/Sgt Chia also informed the Accused that if he was making a false police report, he would\n\nbe liable for the consequences (NE 86). The Accused appeared frustrated (NE 88).\n\nEventually, he did not make a police report.59.        \n\nHowever, S/Sgt Chia had made some notes in the Station Diary (Exhibit P21) regarding the\n\nAccused’s complaint. The material part reads:‘Ang Johnny, 6905439-J, blk\n\n    58, Lor 4, Toa Payoh, #01-49, m/31 yrs in post to inform that a girl named Victim, mother\n\n    have allege that he have rape (sic) his daughter on 25.2.02 at S’pore Shopping\n\n    Centre at Orchard Rd pub. Moreover, her mother have requested for $50,000/- in order to\n\n    settle the case. However, complt claims that hedid not have any sexwith her\n\n    daughter who is believe to be underage.’[Emphasis added.]",
        "Evidence of Inspector Adam Gazari\n\n(PW 23)": "60.        \n\nInspector Adam Gazari was the Investigating Officer.61.        He\n\nsaid the Accused was arrested on 11 April 2002 at about 12.15am on the ground floor of Blk\n\n58 Lorong 4 Toa Payoh. The Accused was seen using a mobile phone prior to his arrest.\n\nAfter the police identified themselves, the Accused immediately kept that mobile phone in\n\na pocket of his trousers. During the arrest, the Accused created a scene, shouting and\n\ncalling out for his mother. The Accused and his mother spoke quickly to each other in\n\nChinese and she reached into a pocket of his and took out a black Nokia mobile phone\n\n(P27). Inspector Gazari asked an officer Senior Staff Sergeant Png Chen Chen to ask the\n\nmother for the mobile phone she had taken. Senior Staff Sergeant Png told him that when\n\nshe asked the mother for that mobile phone, the mother created a scene. That black mobile\n\nphone was found and handed to Insp Gazari. Another white or beige Nokia mobile phone (P26)\n\nwas found in another pocket of the Accused’s trousers (NE 694 and 695). However, as\n\nthe service on these two phones had been terminated, Insp Gazari was not able to obtain\n\ninformation from the service providers as to who the owners thereof were (NE 694).62.        Of\n\nthe four telephones in P24 i.e from which the threatening, abusive and vulgar messages had\n\nbeen sent to the Victim, Insp Gazari had obtained the following information:(a) 94888987 belonged to the\n\n    Accused (NE 667)(b) 90172562 belonged to B (NE\n\n    667)(c) 98765305 belonged to one Ms\n\n    Lau Chee Teng who claimed that the phone had been stolen from her (NE 667 and 668)(d) 90843032 (the Hi-card) was\n\n    registered to Loy Pitt (NE 685). This was the name that Loy See Mua said he had used to\n\n    subscribe to this number.63.        \n\nInsp Gazari only learned that the hotel in question was Sing Hoe Hotel on 12 April 2002\n\n(NE 680) after he brought the Victim to various hotels in Geylang and then to Mountbatten\n\nRoad. By then, the hotel had reused the tapes for their closed circuit cameras and the\n\nchits from the Guest Room Record for February 2002 were no longer available. Insp Gazari\n\nsaid that although he had interviewed the Victim on 6 March 2002, he did not immediately\n\ntake her around to try and locate the hotel in question. He was engaged in another case\n\nand while investigating the Victim’s case, he was assigned to investigate other cases\n\nas well (NE 682).64.        He\n\nalso said that the Victim had identified the chair in Sing Hoe Hotel where she had sat on\n\nthe day in question and the room on her left i.e Room 119. She was brought into the room\n\nand she told him that the toilet was very small and the shower head was just behind the\n\ntoilet door. He told her to check and she did so and confirmed this fact (NE 687).",
        "The arrest of the Accused": "65.        The\n\nAccused was arrested on 11 April 2002. At that time, the intended charge was that he had\n\nraped Victim on or about 25 February 2002 in the evening at an unknown hotel in\n\nMountbatten road. As I have said, the hotel was identified as Sing Hoe Hotel only on 12\n\nApril 2002.",
        "Accused’s statement on 11\n\nApril 2002": "66.        The\n\nAccused’s statement then i.e on 11 April 2002 was that he did not go to the hotel\n\nwith the Victim. He did not beat her up. B could be his witness. He also mentioned that\n\nthe Victim’s mother had demanded $50,000 from him and he had gone to a police post to\n\nreport this.",
        "Accused’s long statement on\n\n15 April 2002": "67.        On\n\n15 April 2002, the Accused gave a long statement. He is a divorcee. He stayed with his\n\nmother and uncle and grandmother. He said that B introduced him to the Victim (whom he\n\nreferred to as ‘Ah Girl’) at a disco/pub in Singapore Shopping Centre. He also\n\nmet the Victim’s mother (C) who sought his assistance to beat up someone who had\n\nmolested the Victim. During that night, the Victim’s mother told her to dance with\n\nhim. He said that he had given the Victim his mobile phone number 94888987. After he left\n\nthe pub in the early morning, the Victim called him about ten times asking him if he\n\nwanted to go down to the pub later that night and saying that her mother wanted to see\n\nhim.68.        On\n\nthe second night at the pub, C asked him if he was interested in the Victim and he said he\n\nwas. He also told C that he was previously a debt collector and when C asked him for his\n\nhelp to collect debts, he agreed. He claimed that the Victim said she did not mind going\n\nout with him as long as her mother approved and that her mother controlled everything.69.        \n\nThis long statement of the Accused did not refer to any date in respect of the two nights\n\nin the pub. The Accused went on to say that about a week later, the Victim called to see\n\nhim. He met her at Blk 60 Toa Payoh. B was also present. All three met at about 8pm. The\n\nAccused said that the Victim hugged him and told him that her mother had wanted her to go\n\nout with many men and had forced her to do many things that she did not want to do. He\n\noffered to speak to C but the Victim declined the offer as C would find fault with her and\n\nwould not let the Accused go.70.        \n\nAbout two days later, he called the Victim but the call was answered by Mdm Loh. He asked\n\nC about what the Victim had told him and C became angry with him and hung up the phone.71.        The\n\nnext day, B came to his flat and told him that C had called her (B). C had told B that the\n\nAccused had raped the Victim and asked B not to be a witness for the Accused. On hearing\n\nthis, the Accused called the Victim who wanted $50,000 from him. C then spoke to him and\n\nthreatened to make a police report if he did not give $50,000. The Accused then went to\n\nmake a police report about the threat. The officer recorded his complaint but no report\n\nwas given to the Accused. I would add that it is not disputed that the Accused did not\n\nmake a written report. The Accused also asked B to be his witness if he should be arrested\n\nand she promised to help him.",
        "Accused’s statement on 18\n\nApril 2002": "72.        \n\nWhen the Accused was charged on 18 April 2002 with outrage of modesty, he made a short\n\nstatement to deny that he had molested the Victim and said he was wrongly accused and\n\nwanted to engage a lawyer.",
        "Oral testimony of the Accused": "73.        The\n\nAccused stayed at Blk 58 Toa Payoh Lorong 4 #01-49. He clarified that the\n\n‘uncle’ staying with him was his stepfather (NE 883) and one of his younger\n\nbrothers also stayed with him before that brother was put in prison. He said he was\n\nunemployed for two to three years (NE 771 to 772) although he later claimed to work as an\n\nodd job labourer (NE 849).74.        He\n\nsaid that his relationship with that of B was that of brother and sister. He had taken\n\npity on her as she was a drug addict and was always being conned by men (NE 792). She had\n\nstayed at his flat on one or two occasions when her boyfriend had beaten her up. On those\n\noccasions, she would sleep outside his flat at the back where there was a corridor.\n\nHowever, he did not confront B’s boyfriend about his assaults on her. He claimed that\n\nLoy Se Mua was B’s boyfriend (NE 758). He had seen Loy twice, once inside and once\n\noutside his (the Accused’s) flat (NE 799 and 800) and a third time when he met B and\n\nthe Victim outside (NE 814).75.        He\n\nsaid that the Victim was his girlfriend although the Victim had never been to his flat (NE\n\n888), unlike B. Neither did he know where the Victim was staying (NE 888). He then said\n\nthat he did ask the Victim where she was staying and she said she used to reside in\n\ndifferent places, sometimes with her grandmother and at times with her mother (NE 891).\n\nShe did not tell him where she was staying with her parents (NE 891).76.        The\n\nAccused said that when the Victim first spoke to him on the telephone, it was to ask him\n\nwhy he did not help B when she was beaten up by her boyfriend.77.        The\n\nAccused also said that when he met the Victim’s parents for the first time at the\n\nNTUC Club, he had told C that he was in prison twelve years ago and that he was not\n\nworking (NE 727). Notwithstanding this, she was impressed by him because he had turned\n\nover a new leaf (NE 825, 829 to 832). He claimed that during this first visit to the NTUC\n\nClub, he had hugged and kissed the Victim.78.        He\n\nsubsequently met B, the Victim and a girlfriend of B’s at a coffeeshop at Lavender\n\nStreet. During that time, he and the Victim spent an hour at a staircase at the tenth\n\nstorey of a block of flats. They hugged and he inserted his finger into her vagina and she\n\nmasturbated him.79.        On\n\nanother night, he went to the NTUC Club a second time with B to meet the Victim. Her\n\nparents were also at the NTUC Club. The Accused claimed that he had some moments alone\n\nwith the Victim, about six to seven times, and on one of these moments, they were in a\n\nsmoking room and made love. He then changed his evidence and said that they made love at a\n\nstaircase (NE 735). The Victim did not object to the love making.80.        The\n\nAccused denied that he had ever mentioned to B that he wanted to get girls to work for him\n\nin a KTV lounge to make money for him. Although the Accused knew about the Victim’s\n\nproblem with her knee, he denied any knowledge about the plan to trick the Victim about\n\nseeing a monk (NE 741). He claimed to be at home on the day of 25 February 2002. In\n\ncross-examination, he said that he was ill and he could only walk after taking some\n\nmedication. He mentioned a doctor by the name of Kelvin whose clinic was at Toa Payoh,\n\ntelephone number 2555188, who was supposed to be able to testify about his condition which\n\nhe said was arthritis. However, he did not elaborate as to how this illness would have\n\nprevented him from leaving home when he had medicine to take in any event.81.        The\n\nAccused said he did not know whether other family members were at home on that day (NE 857\n\nline 20 and 886 line 17/18) even though the flat had only one bedroom and one living room\n\n(NE 721) and even though his mother was not working and would be at home most of the time\n\n(NE 883). Then he said his mother, his ‘uncle’ and he were at home the entire\n\nday (NE 886 line 23 and 24).82.        The\n\nAccused said he first learned about an allegation of rape on 3 March 2002 when C called\n\nhim (NE 743) and she attempted to extort $50,000 from him (NE 745). He claimed that the\n\nVictim then spoke to him at about 11am of 4 March 2002 and told him that she had revealed\n\nto C what had happened at the NTUC Club as between them. The Victim also told him that C\n\nwanted $50,000 and if he did not have this sum, then to give $30,000. Between 12 to 1pm, B\n\nalso spoke to C who had threatened the Accused.83.        He\n\nclaimed that B had used his handphone to send messages to C without his permission and he\n\ndid not know how to do so, having studied up to Primary 3 only. He disagreed with\n\nLoy’s evidence that Loy had given a Hi card with the telephone number 90843032 to\n\nhim.84.        In\n\ncross-examination, he admitted that the police had seized two handphones when he was\n\narrested. One had the phone number 94888987 and the other did not have a phone number. He\n\nhad bought the latter as a second hand phone for his mother on the day he was arrested (NE\n\n775). He said he passed this handphone to his mother on the night he was arrested.85.        The\n\nAccused said that in the course of the recording of his first statement, he did tell\n\nInspector David Chan that he was at home on 25 February 2002 but he did not say this to\n\nthe interpreter Mabel Ang (NE 924). However he was not able to explain satisfactorily why\n\nthis allegation was not recorded in this statement or in his other two statements. All he\n\nmentioned was that he was feeling a bit giddy then (NE 922).",
        "My conclusion": "86.        I\n\nfound that B was the girlfriend of the Accused and not the Victim.87.        \n\nFirst, if the Victim was really the girlfriend of the Accused all along, he would have\n\nmentioned this when he was charged with rape and later on with molest. He did not.88.        \n\nSecondly, the Victim had denied being the Accused’s girlfriend and B had said she\n\n(i.e B herself) was his girlfriend.89.        \n\nThirdly, if the Accused was not B’s boyfriend, then who was? On this point, the\n\nAccused made the belated assertion that Loy was B’s boyfriend. Yet, Mr Ang Sin Teck,\n\nDefence Counsel, had never suggested this to either B or Loy during cross-examination. All\n\nMr Ang suggested to each of these two witnesses was that they knew each other.\n\nFurthermore, the Accused’s evidence that he knew that Loy was B’s boyfriend,\n\nbecause he had seen Loy with B when she came to the Accused’s flat with Loy, was\n\ncontradicted by Mr Ang’s cross-examination of Loy. Mr Ang had put it to Loy that the\n\nAccused did not know him at all (NE 659).90.        \n\nFourthly, I also find that the Victim’s explanation that she first contacted the\n\nAccused because he had slapped B to be corroborated by B’s evidence. Also, the\n\nVictim’s evidence that she was led to believe that the Accused was like a brother to\n\nB is also corroborated by B who had said that that was the Accused’s idea.91.        \n\nFifthly, the Accused had told B not to disclose his real name to the Victim who only knew\n\nhim as Alvin or Wu Ming. This was indicative of the deceptive nature of the Accused.92.        \n\nSixthly, B had said she had stayed with the Accused at his flat and this was not\n\nchallenged by Mr Ang. It was only when the Accused gave evidence that he said that B had\n\nnot stayed in his flat but rather had slept in a space outside his flat. There was no such\n\nsuggestion to B when she was giving evidence.93.        \n\nSeventhly, after having seen B’s demeanour and hearing her evidence, I found that the\n\nAccused was interested in the Victim but his interest was not reciprocated. I accepted\n\nB’s evidence that the Accused wanted to make the Victim fall for him, have sex with\n\nhim and then use her to earn money for him. I also accepted her evidence that the Accused\n\nwas having some difficulty in achieving his aim as the Victim’s mother was looking\n\nout for her.94.        I\n\nalso found that the Accused did not have sexual intercourse with the Victim on the second\n\nnight that he was at the NTUC Club. There was no mention of this in any of his statements\n\nto the police. Indeed, the notes recorded by S/Sgt Chia on 4 March 2002, when the Accused\n\ncame to complain about an attempt to extort money from him, stated that the Accused\n\nhimself had said he did not have sexual intercourse with the Victim who was believed to be\n\nunderaged. I was of the view that the Accused belatedly claimed to have sexual intercourse\n\nwith the Victim on a different occasion to bolster his claim that the Victim was his\n\ngirlfriend and also to explain away any medical evidence that the Victim had had sexual\n\nintercourse.95.        I\n\naccepted B’s evidence that the Accused had wanted her to fix meetings with the Victim\n\nso that he could be alone with the Victim. This was done in respect of one meeting at Toa\n\nPayoh (see paragraph 33 above). However the Accused did not achieve anything then. So he\n\ninstructed B to make another arrangement and she came up with the idea of pretending to\n\nsee a monk on that fateful day i.e 25 February 2002. On this point, B’s evidence\n\ncorroborated the Victim’s that the Victim was led to believe that she was meeting B\n\nto see a monk to address B’s stomach problem and the Victim’s knee problem.\n\nHowever, the real reason was for the Accused to be alone with the Victim.96.        I\n\ndid not accept the Accused’s evidence that he was at home the whole of that day.\n\nFirst, he did not mention this in any of his statements. Secondly, he called no family\n\nmember to corroborate this evidence97.        \n\nThirdly, after mentioning the name of Kelvin as a doctor treating his alleged arthritis,\n\nhe failed to explain how the arthritis would prevent him from leaving home or call Kelvin\n\nas his witness. Fourthly, B said he had left his flat in the evening of that fateful day,\n\npresumably to meet the Victim although she would not know personally whether he did meet\n\nher or not. B was not challenged on this.98.        I\n\nwill come back to the alleged incident at Sing Hoe Hotel later.99.        \n\nSometime later in the night of 25 February 2002, the Victim contacted B and although the\n\nVictim did not say she was raped, it was clear to B that something terrible had happened.\n\nThat was why B cried when the Victim asked her whether she had planned the meeting with\n\nthe Accused. B then urged the Victim not to report the matter to the police as the Accused\n\nwould not let the Victim or B go.100.        I\n\nnow come to the night of 3 March 2002 and early morning of 4 March 2002, before the Victim\n\nmade her police report later on 4 March 2002. There is no dispute that the Victim’s\n\nmother spoke to the Accused and accused him of rape. Some time was spent on the question\n\nwhether it was the Victim’s mother who tried to extort $50,000 from the Accused or\n\nthe other way round. It seemed to me that even if the Victim’s mother had sought to\n\nextort money from the Accused, this did not mean that the allegation of rape was false.\n\nFrom one point of view, that would have reinforced the allegation of rape. Furthermore,\n\neven if the Victim had lied about the extortion attempt being made by the Accused, it did\n\nnot mean that she had lied about the rape.101.        \n\nWhat is more significant is that after the Victim’s mother had made the accusation of\n\nrape, the Accused had told B to lie for him and to say that he was drunk and did not know\n\nwhat he was doing. In my view, this was not a reference to the insertion of his finger\n\ninto the Victim’s vagina but to the rape allegation. The Victim’s mother was not\n\ntalking about the former and the Accused knew that the Victim’s mother would insist\n\nthat the Victim report the alleged rape to the police. B had also said that the Accused\n\nhad warned her not to tell the truth otherwise he would go to jail. In my view, this was\n\ndamning evidence against the Accused.102.        I\n\nwould add that Mr Ang did not suggest to B at any time that she was lying to get even with\n\nthe Accused. Indeed, the Accused’s position was that B was not his girlfriend. Mr Ang\n\nalso did not suggest that B was lying to help the Victim get even with the Accused in some\n\nway. Furthermore, in Mr Ang’s closing submission, he had sought to rely on certain\n\naspects of B’s evidence on the basis that she was a truthful witness. It was also\n\nsignificant that, all along, the Accused had sought to rely on B to be his witness.\n\nHowever, her evidence contradicted his on many of the material points even though she\n\nappeared reluctant at times to testify against him. I was of the view that, generally, she\n\nwas a truthful witness.103.        As\n\nregards the alleged rape, I was aware that there were some inconsistencies in the\n\nVictim’s evidence, for example, as to whether she did or did not notice the Accused\n\ntake anything from a lady at the reception area. Her evidence that she did not know that\n\nthe Accused was going to do something bad to her when he grabbed her arm, carried her and\n\ndropped her on the bed, was suspect. I also took into account her uncertainty as to\n\nwhether she did or did not scream for help.104.        \n\nAgainst that, I took into account her age and the fact that if the Accused did rape the\n\nVictim, everything would have happened quickly and it would have been a sudden and\n\ntraumatic situation for her. It is all very well for lawyers and the court to look back\n\nwith hindsight and, without the immediate tension and trauma, to criticise an alleged\n\nvictim’s evidence of the rape. As the Victim herself had said, the situation was\n\ncomplex (see paragraph 12 above).105.        I\n\nalso took into account the Victim’s evidence that she could recognise the room and\n\nthe toilet. This was corroborated by the evidence of the investigating officer who said\n\nthat when he brought the Victim into the room, she said that the shower head in the toilet\n\n(bathroom) was just behind the door which turned out to be true. The Victim had also said\n\nthe Accused had come back into the room (before he raped her) with a can of beer and Ms\n\nOng Siew Hong had said that there was a refrigerator in front of the reception desk with\n\nsoft drinks and beer.106.        I\n\nalso accepted the Victim’s evidence that she did not report the rape immediately, or\n\nfor that matter tell her mother about it immediately, because the Accused had threatened\n\nher and she was afraid. Later that night, B had also urged her not to make a report later\n\nthat night when the Victim asked B whether she had planned the meeting with the Accused\n\nand B had cried. This was corroborated by B.107.        As\n\nfor the evidence of Ms Ong that she could not recognise the Accused or the Victim, I was\n\nnot surprised that she could not recognise either. The police themselves only knew that\n\nthe hotel concerned was Sing Hoe Hotel on 12 April 2002, more than a month later. Her\n\nstatement was dated 30 August 2002 and there was no evidence before me as to whether Ms\n\nOng had been asked to identify the Accused before the trial. By the time of the trial, it\n\nwas already October 2002. Given the long lapse of time, I also did not place much weight\n\non her other evidence that she did not notice any lady who was giddy, or see a lady and a\n\nman coming out of Room 119 at about 9pm that day. How could she remember? Her evidence\n\nthat she did not remember any shouting is not inconsistent with the Victim’s evidence\n\nsince the Victim did not assert specifically that she did scream for help.108.        \n\nThe aggressive and uncooperative attitude of the Accused when he was examined by Dr Andre\n\nLeong (PW 3) and asked to ejaculate also pointed more to the Accused’s guilt than to\n\nhis innocence. On the other hand, the absence of any bite mark on the Accused’s\n\nshoulder was neither here nor there since the medical examination was done about seven\n\nweeks after the alleged offences.109.        I\n\nnow come to one aspect which Mr Ang had spent much time on during the trial. This is a\n\nrecord of phone calls made to and from the Accused’s handphone (D1). Relying on this\n\nrecord, Mr Ang submitted that it contradicted one aspect of the Victim’s evidence\n\nwhen she said she used the Accused’s handphone to call B on her mobile number\n\n90172502 on 25 February 2002 because there was no record showing such a call as having\n\nbeen made from 94888987 (the Accused’s mobile number) to 90172502.110.        Mr\n\nAng also submitted that the Victim had said that up to 7pm on 25 February 2002, she did\n\nnot have any telephone conversation with the Accused but this was not correct because the\n\ntelephone record showed a call from the Victim’s mobile phone number 97959148 to the\n\nAccused’s mobile phone number 94888987.111.        In\n\nmy view, Mr Ang’s submission on these points was based on the premise that the\n\nAccused had only one mobile phone and that whenever the Victim calls 94888997, she\n\nintended to call the Accused. However, when the Accused was arrested, he had two mobile\n\nphones in his possession. I do not accept his evidence that the second one was a mobile\n\nphone he had bought for his mother in view of the extent he and his mother went to take a\n\nsecond mobile phone away from him when he was arrested. Secondly, the Accused had many SIM\n\ncards, as B herself had said. Thirdly, the Victim was told she could call B (not the\n\nAccused) at 94888987. Fourthly, even if there was some contradiction as to which mobile\n\nphone the Victim had used and which mobile number she had called, I was of the view that\n\nthis was not material in the totality of the evidence before me. After all, the Accused\n\nused various telephone numbers, and the Victim did not know, prior to 25 February 2002,\n\nthat 94888987 was the Accused’s mobile number or that the Accused was B’s\n\nboyfriend. This confusing state of affairs was caused by the Accused.112.        Mr\n\nAng also submitted that the telephone record showed that the Victim had still called\n\n94888987 after she was allegedly raped. Mr Ang submitted that even if the Victim had been\n\ntold to report her whereabouts to the Accused, the telephone calls should be short and yet\n\nthey lasted between 1.68 minutes to 9.21 minutes. There were also some more calls on 4\n\nMarch 2002 at 1.18am and 2.16am when the Victim’s mother wanted to report the rape.113.        In\n\nmy view, the fact that the calls lasted between 1.68 minutes to 9.21 minutes was neither\n\nhere nor there. As the Victim was afraid of the Accused, she would be talking to him for\n\nas long as he wanted her to. As for the calls in the early hours of 4 March 2002, there\n\nwas a heated exchange or exchanges about the payment of $50,000 and it was neither here\n\nnor there if there was more than one call about this.114.        \n\nUltimately, the evidence and submission regarding D1 was a distraction.115.        \n\nFurthermore, the fact that the Accused had gone on 4 March 2002 to the police to make a\n\nreport about the extortion bid was, in my view, neither here nor there. It did not\n\nnecessarily show that the Accused did not rape the Victim. Likewise, the fact that the\n\nAccused decided not to lodge a formal repot i.e a written report was also neither here nor\n\nthere. It did not necessarily show that he was afraid of initiating a police\n\ninvestigation.116.        \n\nNotwithstanding the loss of valuable evidence from the hotel because of the late police\n\ninvestigation, I was satisfied on the evidence before me and beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the Accused had brought the Victim to Sing Hoe Hotel and raped her in Room 119 in the\n\nevening of 25 February 2002, and, in so doing, he had voluntarily caused hurt to her.\n\nAccordingly, I convicted him on the charge under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code.117.        I\n\nwas also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the Accused had wrongfully restrained\n\nthe Victim and used criminal force on her intending to outrage her modesty i.e by kissing\n\nher breasts and sucking her nipples. Accordingly, I also convicted the Accused on the\n\ncharge under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code.",
        "Sentencing": "118.        On\n\nsentencing, I took into account the guidelines inChia Kim Heng Frederick v PP[1992] 1 SLR 361, but I bore in mind that the charge in that case was under s 376(1) of\n\nthe Penal Code which attracts a lighter sentence than one under s 376(2)(a). Under s\n\n376(2)(a), the minimum imprisonment is not less than eight years and not more than 20\n\nyears with caning of not less than 12 strokes.119.        \n\nThe Accused had a series of past convictions for offences including robbery, criminal\n\nintimidation and living on the earnings of a prostitute. Although he made himself out to\n\nbe a protector of young girls, he was in fact a predator. He manipulated B and deceived\n\nthe Victim. He did not plead guilty and during the trial, he continued with his strategy\n\nof deception to avoid conviction. He showed no remorse.120.        On\n\nthe other hand, the Accused’s acts of violence against the Victim were not\n\nparticularly brutal.121.        In\n\nthe circumstances, I sentenced the Accused to 12 years’ imprisonment and 12 strokes\n\nof the cane on the first charge under s 376(2)(a) of the Penal Code. The sentence of\n\nimprisonment was to take effect from the date he was remanded i.e 12 April 2002.122.        On\n\nthe second charge under s 354A(1) of the Penal Code, the offence was carried out in the\n\ncourse of the more serious offence under s 376(2)(a). I sentenced the Accused to the\n\nminimum of 2 years’ imprisonment and one stroke of the cane. The sentence of\n\nimprisonment under the second charge was to run concurrently with that under the first\n\ncharge.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
