        "The plaintiff’s case": "3. Abani is a Singapore company engaged in trading. It purchased from\n\nIndo Energy Pte Ltd (\"Indo Energy\") under a contract dated 16 June 2000 5000\n\nmetric tons Tonasa brand cement and 6000 metric tons Indo Bull brand cement on FOB terms,\n\nloading port Makassar, South Sulawesi. Both brands of cement are produced by PT Semen\n\nTonasa in Indonesia. The quantities were subsequently increased to 13,000 metric tons\n\ncomprising 7000 metric tons Tonasa brand cement and 6000 metric tons Indo Bull brand\n\ncement.4. Abani was not only sourcing the cement from Indo Energy. Its\n\ndirector Ajaykumar Mahendra made enquiries with Poh Fang about Tonasa brand cement in the\n\nfirst week of June, but they could not agree on a price.5. Ajaykumar’s evidence was that throughout June and July, Wong\n\nPoh Seng (\"Wong\"), a director of Poh Fang continued to try to secure a sale.\n\nWhen Ajaykumar informed him that Abani had obtained the cement it needed, Wong was\n\nunhappy. Wong persuaded him to change his mind, and warned him that things in Indonesia\n\ncan go wrong easily. On 14 July, Wong told him that Abani could not import Tonasa brand\n\ncement into Madagascar which was not purchased from Poh Fang because Poh Fang was the sole\n\nagent for PT Semen Tonasa. Ajaykumar mentioned Wong’s disapproval in a fax of 14 July\n\nto Madagascar, where the cement was intended to be shipped to under a contract of sale\n\ndated 19 June with a purchaser named Tranombarotra Mpangalana.6. Abani also entered into negotiations with Delta to secure a vessel,\n\nthe Jordan II, for that purpose. A voyage charterparty dated 14 June was executed between\n\nthe parties to carry 11,000 metric tons of cement from Makassar to Madagascar,\n\nsubsequently increased to 13,000 metric tons.7. Abani received a Notice of Readiness dated 14 July issued under the\n\ncharterparty that the Jordan II was ready to load its cargo. The notice was issued by\n\nDelta’s agent in Singapore, Shoreline Shipcare Services (\"Shoreline\"), on\n\nbehalf of Delta.8. On 14 July Delta sought Abani’s assistance to pay US$145,875\n\ndue to the head owners of the Jordan II for hire and ballast. Abani agreed to pay\n\nUS$126,825 and made payment on the same day. Abani also agreed to pay another US$110,000\n\non 20 July if 50% of its cargo was loaded by that day.9. Loading of Abani’s cement then proceeded on the Jordan II.\n\nShoreline reported to Abani on 19 July 2000 that 2543 metric tons were loaded, with 10,457\n\nmetric tons to follow.10. The transactions then ran into difficulties. On 21 July Shoreline\n\nwrote to Abani to demand payment of US$110,000. At the same time the US$126,825 that Abani\n\nhad paid on behalf of Delta on 14 July was credited back into Abani’s bank account.\n\nThe credit notice stated the details of credit as \"Refund of freight deposit and\n\nbooking cancellation of m.v. Jordan II\". Delta did not make the payment from its own\n\nfunds. The US$126,825 was provided by Poh Fang.11. Delta was somewhat ambivalent about the cancellation. On 22 July,\n\nthe day after the refund of the US$126,825 it requested Abani to pay freight under the\n\ncharterparty, implying that the charterparty was subsisting. It was only on 23 July that\n\nDelta informed Abani that the charterparty was cancelled for non-payment.12. Poh Fang became more involved in the matters at this juncture. It\n\nwrote to the master of the Jordan II, PT Semen Tonasa, Delta, and the \"receiver in\n\nMadagascar\" on 23 July (the day Delta issued the notice of cancellation) that it was\n\nthe charterer of the vessel and that no other party was involved in the transaction. At\n\nthe same time it confirmed its acceptance of 2682 metric tons of Tonasa brand cement and\n\n83,341 bags of Indo Bull brand cement already loaded on board the Jordan II.13. PT Semen Tonasa reacted by informing Abani on 24 July that it was\n\nstopping loading onto the Jordan II until Abani obtained another vessel.14. Shoreline was drawn further into the dispute at this stage. On 24\n\nJuly it wrote as the agent of Delta to Indo Energy and Poh Fang asserting that the\n\ncharterparty between Delta and Abani was still in force, and stating that Delta cannot\n\nunilaterally cancel the charterparty. Shoreline’s communication was consistent with\n\nAbani’s assertion that the secured payment of US$110,000 was conditional to the\n\nloading of half of Abani’s cargo. There was no record or report of the state of\n\nloading achieved on 20 July, or that the condition was satisfied. However, Delta\n\nmaintained its position and declared that the cancellation of the charterparty was final.15. Shoreline was also in communication with Poh Fang. Peter Abesayna\n\n(who is also known as Chriss Peter) the shipbroker at Shoreline who dealt with the\n\ncharterparty spoke to Vonny Poernomo, another director of Poh Fang. He asked about Poh\n\nFang’s involvement with the charterparty of the Jordan II, and she explained that Poh\n\nFang wanted to shut Abani and Indo Energy from the Madagascar market and was prepared to\n\ndo anything to ensure that.16. Without a vessel, Abani’s venture to ship the cement to\n\nMadagascar came to an end.",
        "The defence": "17. Poh Fang’s defence was that it had made its own arrangements\n\nto purchase cement from PT Semen Tonasa for sale to Madagascar. It entered into an\n\nagreement with PT Semen Tonasa on 7 July. To ship the cement, it entered into a\n\ncharterparty with Delta for the Jordan II on 12 July. It did not know that the Jordan II\n\nwas also chartered to Abani until 19 July, when it helped Delta to make the US$126,825\n\nrefund to Abani. When Wong became aware of Abani’s charterparty on 19 July, and he\n\nknew that the double booking of a vessel was illegal.18. The witnesses for Poh Fang had difficulty reconciling the\n\ndocumentary evidence with its defence that it had purchased the cement on 7 July and\n\nchartered the Jordan II on 12 July.19. The first document Poh Fang relied on was its letter of 21 July\n\ninforming that PT Semen TonasaWe are now successfully obtaining the chartering of the vessel, MV\n\n  Jordan II after our initial advance payment of freight, which has been paid as\n\n  follows:- USD126,825 (T/T to PT Delta Karina Mandiri)- USD80,000 (T/T to Jordan Shipping)- USD10,000 (T/T to PT Delta Karina Mandiri via your bank account)Since we are now the charterer,we will accept whatever jumbo bags\n\n  packing cement loaded on board (Quantity for not more than 5,000 MT) and remaining balance\n\n  of 50 kg on boardin order to fill up to vessel maximum quantity, it must be the\n\n  packing of 50 kg bag (2 ply kraft paper plus 1 ply woven laminated) \"Macoma\"\n\n  brand. Kindly immediately prepare the above packing with our brand the soonest.The L/C for the above, will be issued by BNP Singapore sometimes next week andappreciate\n\n  your Sales Contract for our preparation.(Emphasis added)20. Another document that Poh Fang relied on is a letter from PT Semen\n\nTonasa dated 27 July and faxed to it on 29 July. The letter which bore the caption\n\n\"L/C of MV Jordan II and Draft Contract of Cement\" statedConsidering that vessel loads 13,000 MT of cement for Madagascar to be\n\n  changed to Poh Fang, therefore please be opened the L/C ASAP, because the vessel will\n\n  finish loading today and the vessel will be arrested by us if the L/C can not be issued by\n\n  you today.Herewith we are sending you the above contract and please be returned after you sign.(Emphasis\n\n  added)21. That letter indicated that five pages were faxed. The other four\n\npages were two copies of a two-page sale contract dated 7 July signed by PT Semen Tonasa\n\nbut not Poh Fang. On the face of the letter, the draft contracts were forwarded to Poh\n\nFang to be signed and returned.22. Poh Fang also produced a signed copy of the agreement. It was the\n\nsame agreement as the one forwarded by PT Semen Tonasa on 29 July, except that Poh\n\nFang’s chop and the signature of Vonny Poernomo were added.23. It was evident from these documents that Poh Fang’s assertion\n\nthat \"The 2ndDefendants entered into a written agreement with PT Semen\n\nTonasa for the purchase of 13,000 MT of ordinary Portland cement on 7 July 2000\" in\n\nits answer to interrogatories was not true.24. Counsel for Abani sought Wong’s explanation for Poh\n\nFang’s request for the sale contract in its letter of 21 July if there was already an\n\nagreement on 7 July. His reply was that it really wanted an invoice, not a contract. The\n\nexplanation was clearly inconsistent with the clear terms of the letter. Furthermore, if\n\nPoh Fang wanted an invoice, there was no evidence that it corrected its request, and no\n\ninvoice from PT Semen Tonasa was produced in evidence.25. Under further questioning, Wong’s answers became more\n\ndifficult to follow. He said that Poh Fang did not sign the contract sent on 29 July\n\nbecause it had signed it on 7 July, then he went on to say he could not remember how the\n\nagreement was signed on 7 July. Abani’s counsel asked for the signed agreement of 7\n\nJuly to be produced, but was told that Poh Fang did not have it.26. Poh Fang’s assertion just could not stand. It is clear that\n\nthere was no sales agreement on 21 July and the contract was only forwarded to Poh Fang\n\nfor signature on 29 July with the letter dated 27 July. I find on the evidence that there\n\nwas no agreement between Poh Fang and PT Semen Tonasa for the purchase of cement on 7\n\nJuly.27. Serious questions were raised over Poh Fang’s claim that it\n\nsecured the charterparty on the Jordan II on 12 July. Poh Fang had stated in its letter of\n\n21 July that it had secured the charterparty after making the initial advance payment of\n\nfreight. That payment was made on 21 July.28. Counsel for Abani drew attention to the fact that the parties’\n\ncontemporaneous conduct was not consistent with Poh Fang being the charterer on 12 July.\n\nUnder the terms of the charterparty, a Notice of Readiness (\"NOR\") should be\n\nissued to the charterer when the vessel is ready to load. Such a notice was issued on 14\n\nJuly by Shoreline to Abani but not Poh Fang. Delta also informed Abani on its own of the\n\nJordan II’s readiness to load. This was only consistent with Abani being the\n\ncharterer of the vessel. When Wong was asked why no NOR was sent to Poh Fang, no\n\nexplanation was offered beyond stating that Delta did not send it.29. Poh Fang’s position was not tenable. Shoreline issued the NOR\n\nas Delta’s agents and Delta repeated the notice in its letter of 14 July. This was\n\nclear evidence that Delta recognised Abani as the charterer of the Jordan II on 14 July,\n\nand did not regard Poh Fang as the charterer. In addition to that, Poh Fang admitted in\n\nits letter of 21 July that it secured the charterparty after making the advance freight\n\npayment and that was on 21 July. There is no basis for its claim that it secured the\n\ncharterparty on 12 July.",
        "Evaluation of the evidence": "30. As I have stated, I reject Poh Fang’s assertions that it\n\ncontracted to buy cement from PT Semen Tonasa on 7 July and secured the charterparty on\n\n124 July. In making these assertions, Poh Fang was not mistaken, but was lying in the face\n\nof events and documents in its knowledge and possession.31. On the other hand, I accept Ajaykumar’s evidence that Wong was\n\nunhappy when Abani did not buy the cement from Poh Fang. His evidence was consistent and\n\nwas supported by the fax of 14 July.32. I also accept Peter Abesayna’s evidence of Vonny\n\nPoernomo’s determination to keep Abani and Indo Energy out of Madagascar market. That\n\nwas consistent with her fellow director Wong’s attitude. There was also evidence that\n\nshe was involved in the termination of Abani’s charterparty. When Abani’s\n\nsolicitors wrote to Delta to demand to reinstate the charterparty with Abani she prepared\n\na draft reply for Delta.33. There is clear evidence that Poh Fang and Delta were acting\n\ntogether when Delta terminated Abani’s charterparty. Poh Fang was upset that Abani\n\nwas purchasing the cement from Indo Energy directly and selling it to Madagascar. It\n\nprovided the funds for Delta to refund the advance freight payment made by Abani, agreed\n\nto take over the vessel although no NOR had been issued to it, and also accepted\n\nAbani’s Tonasa brand and Indo Bull brand cement on the Jordan II although it had not\n\npurchased Indo Bull brand cement from PT Semen Tonasa before or after this occasion.",
        "Inducement and procurement of breach": "34. Does the evidence support the allegation that Poh Fang had induced\n\nand procured Delta’s breach of the charterparty?Halsbury’s Laws of EnglandVol.45(2) 4thEdn, Reissue states at para 687Where one person by either direct or indirect means intentionally\n\n  induces a second person to commit a breach of contract against a third person or prevents\n\n  or hinders the performance of that contract, so that that third person suffers damage, the\n\n  first commits a wrong actionable at the suit of the third, unless the inducement is\n\n  justifiable.35. The Court of Appeal expanded on this inTribune Investment Trust\n\nInc v Soosan Trading Co Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 405. It held that16. … … To knowingly procure or induce a third party to break\n\n  his contract to the damage of the other contracting party without reasonable justification\n\n  or excuse forms the basis of the tort of inducing a breach of contract.17. An act of inducement per se is not by itself actionable. The\n\n  plaintiff must satisfy a two-fold requirement in order to found a sustainable cause of\n\n  action: First, he must show that the procurer acted with the requisite knowledge of the\n\n  existence of the contract (although knowledge of the precise terms is not necessary); and\n\n  second, that the procurer intended to interfere with its performance. …36. There was no direct evidence that Poh Fang induced Delta to cancel\n\nthe charterparty, but the inquiry does not stop here. Direct evidence cannot and need not\n\nbe shown in every case. Where one party sets out to subvert another’s contract, it\n\nmay not leave direct evidence of its actions. In such a situation, the target should not\n\nbe without remedy. All the relevant facts should be considered, and where appropriate,\n\ninducement can be inferred.37. In this case the facts showed that Poh Fang and Abani were\n\npotential competitors in the Madagascar cement market, and Poh Fang was unhappy over\n\nAbani’s intention to export cement there. Poh Fang was also involved in the\n\ntermination of the charterparty by supplying the money for the refund and by taking over\n\nthe charterparty as well as the loaded cement.38. Poh Fang gave cause to question its motives when it falsified the\n\ndates of the purchase agreement and charterparty. If those were regular transactions,\n\nthere was no need to antedate them. They were antedated to conceal Poh Fang’s\n\nintervention when Abani’s contracts were still in force.39. Looking at all the evidence, I find that Poh Fang’s inducement\n\nof Delta’s breach of the charterparty was established on a balance of probabilities\n\nand that the two further requirements referred to by the Court of Appeal were also\n\nsatisfied.",
        "Conversion": "40.Halsbury’s Laws of Singaporestates at Vol.18 para\n\n240.605 thatTo constitute conversion there must be positive wrongful act of dealing\n\n  with the goods in a manner inconsistent with the owner’s rights, and an intention in\n\n  so doing to deny the owner’s rights or to assert a right inconsistent with them. This\n\n  inconsistency is the gist of the action. There need not be any knowledge on the part of\n\n  the person sued that the goods belong to someone else; nor need there be any positive\n\n  intention to challenge the true owner’s rights.41. Poh Fang knew that Abani had chartered the Jordan II and commenced\n\nloading when the charterparty was cancelled, and it took over the cement together with the\n\nvessel.42. The cement was loaded pursuant to a sale to Abani on FOB terms.\n\nUnder these terms, a seller has discharged their duties when the goods sold are loaded\n\nonto the vessel, and the risk passed to the buyer. This is reinforced by s 32(1) of the\n\nSales of Goods Act which provides thatWhere, in pursuance of contract of sale, the seller is authorised or\n\n  required to send the goods to the buyer, delivery of the goods to a carrier (whether named\n\n  by the buyer or not) for the purpose of transmission to the buyer is prima facie deemed to\n\n  be a delivery of the goods to the buyer.43. The cement was delivered to Abani when it was loaded on the Jordan\n\nII, and Poh Fang converted the cement when it took over the cement on 23 July.",
        "Damages": "44. Abani quantified its damages arising from Poh Fang’s\n\ninducement and procurement of the breach of the charterparty at US$261,560.00. This was\n\ncomputed on the price that it would have received from its purchaser Tranombarotra\n\nMpangalana in Madagascar, for 13,000 metric tons of cement, after deducting the purchase\n\nprice of the same cement from PT Semen Tonasa and the freight charges under the\n\ncharterparty.45. The proper damages are not to be arrived that way. Abani must show\n\nthat the loss it incurred was unavoidable – seeMcGregor on Damages17thEdn paras 295-7. When the Jordan II was not available, it could have continued with the\n\nsale by securing another vessel to carry the cement if that was possible. There was no\n\nevidence of its efforts after 23 July to carry on with the sale. Secondly, there is\n\nconfusion over the quantity of cement sold to Madagascar. The sale contract was for 11,000\n\nmetric tons. There was a request from the purchaser to increase the order by 2000 metric\n\ntons, but no evidence of a response from Abani. Then Abani produced its invoice to the\n\npurchaser for 15,000 metric tons. Furthermore counsel for Poh Fang made a valid point that\n\nAbani should disclose the communications between itself and the purchaser leading to the\n\nagreement of 19 June, and after the sale was aborted. Such disclosures which can throw\n\nlight upon the matter should be made.46. On the damages for conversion, Abani did not specify the quantity\n\nof cement alleged to be converted by Poh Fang in its statement of claim. In its closing\n\nsubmissions, reference was made to the 2,682 metric tons and 83,341 bags referred to in\n\nPoh Fang’s letter of 23 July.47. Counsel quantified damages at US$166,171.50 computed on the cost\n\nprice under the agreement with Indo Energy of 16 June. Reliance was placed onThe Jag\n\nShakti[1986] AC 337 where the Privy Council ruled that where a shipowner converted\n\ncargo by delivering it without the production of letters of credit, the damages payable\n\nwas the full market value of the cargo at the time and place of conversion. While that is\n\nnow settled law, it does not support the computation. The agreement of 16 June showed the\n\ncontract price of cement on that day. It was not evidence of the market price prevailing\n\non 23 July when the conversion took place.48. For the reasons mentioned, I am unable to determine the proper\n\ndamages on the evidence before me, and I order damages be assessed by the Registrar.49. Abani having succeeded in its claims should be awarded costs.\n\nHowever, it will not be full costs because Abani had proceeded on another cause of action,\n\nconspiracy with Delta, which it abandoned at the commencement of the trial. Abani is to\n\nreceive two-thirds of the costs of the action.Sgd:Kan Ting ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
