        "Background facts and findings": "3.        In\n\nview of the numerous allegations made by and against each party, I will set out the\n\nbackground facts in some detail.4.        On 8\n\nSeptember 1999, Feoso entered into a contract with a company in Hong Kong called Ever\n\nBright Energy Co Ltd (‘Ever Bright’). The contract was for Feoso to buy from\n\nEver Bright a cargo described as heavy crude oil (off-specification). The detailed\n\nspecifications were set out in Attachment 1 to the contract. The cargo’s country of\n\norigin was Iran and the port of discharge was Huangpu, China. The quantity was between\n\n21,000 to 30,000 metric tonnes.5.        On\n\nthe same date, Feoso entered into a contract with a company in Singapore called Titan Oil\n\nPte Ltd (‘Titan’) to sell the same cargo to Titan. However the cargo was\n\ndescribed in this contract as 380 CST Fuel Oil, although the detailed specifications set\n\nout in the attachment to this contract were the same as those set out in Feoso’s\n\ncontract with Ever Bright.6.        On\n\n13 October 1999, Faith entered into a Tanker Voyage Charter Party (‘the Head\n\nCP’) on the Asbatankvoy form with Persing Energy Corp of Panama\n\n(‘Persing’). The Head CP stated the load port as Kharg Island, Iran, and the\n\ndischarging port was Huangpu, China. The cargo was described as ‘Crude and/or Dirty\n\nPetroleum Product’.7.        The\n\nHead CP was negotiated between the respective brokers:(a) DLP Maritime SA (‘DLP\n\n    Maritime’) for Faith(b) Meridian Brokerage Inc\n\n    (‘Meridian’) for PersingFaith’s manager of the\n\nVessel was Seaworld Management & Trading Inc (‘Seaworld’).8.        On\n\nthe same date, Persing entered into a voyage charter party (‘the Sub CP’) with\n\nNordic Long Term Lease Limited (‘Nordic’) of Hong Kong for the Vessel also to\n\nload cargo at Kharg Island and to discharge the cargo at Huangpu. The cargo in the Sub CP\n\nwas described as crude oil slops. Unlike the Head CP, the Sub CP contained a term that new\n\nbills of lading would be issued in Singapore describing the cargo as fuel oil\n\noff-specification. Nordic is a related company of Ever Bright who sold the cargo to Feoso.9.        As\n\nmany parties, including solicitors, were involved, there is attached to my judgment a list\n\nof the various parties and, where applicable, their solicitors. The reference in my\n\njudgment to ‘CB’ is to Core Bundles prepared by the parties after the trial. The\n\nCore Bundles were actually supposed to be a comprehensive set of documents in\n\nchronological order. However, as they were not comprehensive, I have also in my judgment\n\nreferred to other bundles used in the trial.10.        The\n\nloading operations at Kharg Island stretched from 16 October 1999 to 20 November 1999. On\n\n21 November 1999, the Master issued a Bill of Lading KHA-001 (‘B/L No 1’). The\n\nshipper’s description of goods was crude oil slops. The net weight and the gross\n\nweight of the cargo were included in B/L No 1.11.        All\n\nthe other relevant documents also described the cargo as crude oil slops, for example:(a) SGS (Iran) Ltd, Sample Report(b) Saybolt-Van Duyn BV, Bunker\n\n    Report(c) Saybolt-Van Duyn BV, Sample\n\n    Receipt(d) National Iranian Oil Company\n\n    Ship’s Ullage Report (the description of crude oil slops in this document is found in\n\n    AB1 34 but not in AB1 140. Only the latter was used for the Core Bundle)(e) the shipper’s\n\n    Certificate of Origin(f) Cargo Manifest issued by the\n\n    load port agents Sea Express Company Ltd(g) Sabolt-Iran Ullage Report.12.        The\n\nVessel departed Kharg Island with the cargo on 30 November 1999. En route to Huangpu,\n\nthere were two developments, which were inter-related. The first was the diversion of the\n\nVessel to Singapore before it proceeded to Huangpu. This was for the purpose of samples of\n\nthe cargo to be taken. The other was in respect of the issue of a second set of bills of\n\nlading which were eventually issued as No KHA 002/003/004 (‘B/L No 2, 3 and 4’).13.        The\n\ntaking of samples in Singapore on the instructions of Feoso was not simply to verify the\n\nnature of the cargo loaded on the Vessel. The motive was more dubious. The purpose was to\n\nobtain a survey report from SGS in Singapore which ‘must show the name of cargo as\n\n\"Fuel Oil (3.5S)\" (see the fax dated 8 December 1999 from Feoso to a company in\n\nSingapore New Orient Petroleum Pte Ltd (CB 208)).14.        As\n\nregards the issuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4, this was already anticipated as between Ever\n\nBright and Feoso. Before the sale and purchase contract between them was entered into,\n\nEver Bright had informed Feoso that the cargo description in their contract had to be\n\nheavy crude oil as that was the cargo description in Ever Bright’s contract with its\n\nvendor. However, Feoso wanted documents to describe the cargo as fuel oil instead. For\n\nthis reason, Ever Bright had informed Feoso that it had obtained confirmation from the\n\nship chartering company nominated by their supplier that they would provide documents\n\ndescribing the cargo as fuel oil off-specification to enable the cargo to be discharged in\n\nChina. These facts can be ascertained from Ever Bright’s fax to Feoso dated 31 August\n\n1999 (CB 17). This alleged confirmation was not from Faith. As will be recalled, the Sub\n\nCP included a term for new bills to be issued to describe the cargo as fuel oil\n\noff-specification but not the Head CP.15.        One\n\nreason why Feoso wanted documents showing the cargo as fuel oil off-specification was\n\nbecause if they had told their buyer Titan that the cargo was heavy crude oil\n\n(off-specification), Titan would not have bought the cargo. Indeed, Feoso’s Mr Fung\n\nTze Tat, also known as William Fung, admitted this (NE 702). However, he subsequently\n\ndenied the admission. Then, when Mr Ajaib Haridass, Counsel for Feoso, confirmed that\n\nevidence, Mr Fung said he wanted to change his evidence to, ‘… I don’t know\n\nas I am not an employee of Titan’ (NE 722 to 723). I should add that the sale to\n\nTitan was eventually terminated although it is not necessary for me to elaborate on the\n\nreason(s) for the termination.16.        On\n\n15 December 1999, the Master received the following discharge instructions, which had been\n\napparently sent by Persing or its broker to Seaworld Management who in turn sent it to the\n\nMaster (see PB1A 261 to 263). The discharge instructions said, inter alia:‘A) VSL TO PROCEED WITH\n\n    MAXIMUM SAFE SPEED, NAVIGATION/WEATHER PERMITTING AND DIRECTLY TO HUANGPU, CHINA TO\n\n    DISCHARGE HER ENTIRE CARGO VIA STS [meaning: ship to ship] OPERATION. SURVEY WILL BE\n\n    LIKELY MADE JOINTLY BY SGS AND SAYBOLT.PRIOR TO ARRIVAL THE STS\n\n    POSITION, MASTER TO CONTACT AGENTS FOR STS INSTRUCTIONS.B) UPON RECEIVING THIS TLX,\n\n    MASTER TO ALSO SEND ETA NOTICES TO AGENTSC) UPON ARRIVAL AT THE CUSTOMARY\n\n    ANCHORAGE AND WHEN SHE IS IN ALL RESPECTS READY TO DISCHARGE HER CARGO, MASTER TO TENDER\n\n    N.O.R. TO CHARTERERS VIA BROKERS, RECEIVERS VIA AGENTS AND PACIFIC ANDES HONG KONG TLX\n\n    89124 ANDPS HX.….’The instructions also specified\n\nthe load port agents to be China Ocean Shipping Agency Guangzhou (Penavico) (see CB 221).17.        By\n\na fax dated 15 December 1999, Nordic wrote to its broker Discovery Chartering Ltd\n\n(‘Discovery’) requesting owners to authorise Nordic to sign and issue B/L No 2,\n\n3 and 4 and forwarded drafts thereof (Thanos’ AEIC p 321). Discovery was also\n\nrequested to confirm that the Master of the Vessel would be instructed to change the cargo\n\ndescription in the cargo manifest to fuel oil 3.5S. The draft bills showed, inter alia,\n\nthe shippers’ description of the cargo to be fuel oil 3.5S, and not even fuel oil\n\noff-specification as stipulated in the Sub CP. The drafts also had other differences when\n\ncompared with B/L No 1 and these differences were raised by Faith when it responded, as I\n\nshall elaborate later.18.        \n\nThere was an exchange of telexes between Discovery (Nordic’s brokers) and Meridian\n\n(Persing’s brokers) between 15 and 16 December 1999 in which Meridian stated that\n\nowners were not prepared to agree to the issue of B/L No 2, 3 and 4 unless monies owing to\n\nthem were paid (see Thanos’ AEIC p 332). However, according to Mr Thanos, the\n\nreference to the owners meant Persing (see NE 23 line 7, NE 25 to 26).19.        As\n\nfor Faith, it too had taken the opportunity to obtain a survey report while the Vessel was\n\nin Singapore. This was to ascertain the nature of the cargo. The report was by ALS\n\nTechnichem (S) Pte Ltd (‘ALS’). It was dated 16 December 1999 and appeared to\n\nsuggest that the cargo was fuel oil.20.        In\n\nthe light of this, when the request for the issuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4 was made known\n\nto Faith, Faith was prepared in principle to agree to the issuance of such bills provided:(a) the three sets of B/L No 1\n\n    were returned for cancellation(b) B/L No 2, 3 and 4 would refer\n\n    to the date of the Head CP(c) the gross and net quantities\n\n    of the cargo were stated in B/L No 2, 3 and 4.They also raised two concerns:(i) the date on B/L No 2, 3 and 4\n\n    should be the last date of loading i.e 20 November 1999 instead of 30 November 1999(ii) Ever Bright should be named\n\n    as shipper on the new bills. In B/L No 1, the shipper was Al Warqaa.21.        In\n\nthe meantime, Nordic sent an urgent fax to Discovery dated 16 December 1999 which was\n\ncopied to Meridian (CB 225). It stated:‘RE: M.T. ‘DAPHNE\n\n    L’PLS RUSH OWNERS TO CONFIRM NAME\n\n    OF AGENTS IN HUANGPU.WE HAVE ALREADY ADVISED THAT\n\n    OWNERS/MASTER SHOULD DECLARE THIS CARGO AS ‘FUEL OIL (3.5S)NOT CRUDE OIL SLOPS.\n\n    THE FUEL OIL GRADE HAS BEEN ATTESTED BY BOTH SGS AND SAYBOLT IN IRAN AND NEW CERTIFICATES\n\n    OF QUALITY SHOWN AS ‘FUEL OIL (3.5S) HAVE BEEN DULY ISSUED.PLS ENSURE THAT MASTERDO NOT\n\n    DISCLOSE OR PRESENT ANY LOADPORT DOCUMENT WITH DESCRIPTION AS CRUDE OIL SLOPS.

PLEASE REQUEST MASTER TO IMMEDIATELY SEND\n\n    AGENTS CORRECTION ADVISING THEM THAT CARGO ON BOARD IS FUEL OIL 3.5S.PLEASE CONFIRM.’23.        On\n\nthe same date, Meridian also sent another fax to DLP Maritime (PB1A 286 and 279) stating,\n\ninter alia:‘IN THE MEANTIME AGENTS HAVE\n\n    KEPT MASTER’S CORRESPONDENCE WHICH WAS SENT IN ERROR AND WILL (sic) HANDED TO\n\n    OUR CHRS REPS. MWHILE PLEASE ENSURE MASTER WILL ONLY NAME CARGO AS FUEL OIL. ALSO PLEASE\n\n    REQUEST MASTER TO AMEND CARGO MANIFEST READ ‘FUEL OIL 3.5S’ AND SENT A COPY TO\n\n    US.’24.        On\n\n17 December 1999, Meridian sent a fax dated 17 December 1999 to Nordic to respond to the\n\nrequest for B/L No 2, 3 and 4 to be issued. The fax stated that upon receipt of\n\nconfirmation and evidence of payment of outstanding amounts, Nordic ‘shall be duly\n\nauthorized to issue and sign new set(s) of Bs/L …’ (Thanos’ AEIC p 379).25.        In\n\nresponse, Nordic replied by fax on the same day to forward a copy of a remittance advice\n\nto prove that outstanding amounts had been paid and forwarded copies of B/L No 2, 3 and 4\n\nissued by Nordic. These bills showed:(a) the place and date of issue\n\n    as Hong Kong 30-Nov-99(b) the shipper’s\n\n    description of goods to be fuel oil 3.5S(c) only the net weight(d) the shipper as being Ever\n\n    Bright.In the same fax, Nordic also\n\nforwarded a letter of indemnity dated 17 December 1999 on its letterhead and addressed to\n\nboth Faith and to Persing (Thanos’ AEIC p 380 to 386).26.        Up\n\nto this stage, Faith had not yet approved the issuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4. Nordic had\n\nassumed from Meridian’s fax dated 17 December 1999 (see para 24 above), that so long\n\nas the outstanding payments were made, Faith had authorised Nordic to issue and sign these\n\nbills of lading. However Meridian was the broker of Persing and not of Faith. Neither had\n\nFaith approved the terms of the letter of indemnity.27.        On\n\n20 December 1999, the Master of the Vessel sent a telex to Meridian to seek confirmation\n\nthat B/L No 1 had been cancelled and a new bill of lading had been issued to reflect the\n\nexact quality of the cargo (CB 267). However, this must be considered in the context that\n\nhe was merely responding to what he was being told by Meridian at that time.28.        In\n\nany event, on 21 December 1999, Faith sent a fax to Meridian to object to B/L No 2, 3 and\n\n4 (CB 280 and 281). A similar message was sent, also on the same date, by Seaworld\n\nManagement to the load port agents Penavico (CB 282 and 283).29.        On\n\nthe same date, i.e 21 December 1999, the Vessel arrived at Gui Shan anchorage, off\n\nHuangpu. It was not disputed that this was the customary place of anchorage, pending\n\nnotice of arrival being given to the relevant authorities. The Master tendered Notice of\n\nReadiness at about 1237 hours of 21 December 1999 but did not notify the Chinese\n\nauthorities of the Vessel’s arrival which was supposed to be given within 24 hours of\n\narrival.30.        On\n\nthe same date, Nordic gave written instructions to Meridian which were in turn forwarded\n\nby Meridian to DLP Maritime (CB 276 and 277) that said,‘Prior to releasing of cargo\n\n    and commencing discharge, please instruct Master toforbidany person to go aboard\n\n    the vesselto inspectand/or take cargo sampling.’[Emphasis added.]31.        On\n\n23 December 1999, Nordic sent a fax to Meridian to say that B/L No 2, 3 and 4 had already\n\nbeen released to the buyer, meaning Feoso, and asked for the name of a party to whom B/L\n\nNo 1 should be returned for cancellation. They were provided with the name of A. Bilbrough\n\n& Co.32.        On\n\n24 December 1999, Ince & Co, acting for Nordic, sent a fax to A. Bilbrough & Co,\n\nto inform them that Ever Bright had surrendered the original set of three bills of lading\n\nrelating to B/L No 1 and that they would be surrendered to A. Bilbrough & Co in return\n\nfor the Letter of Indemnity addressed to Faith and Persing.33.        I\n\nshould point out that according to the evidence of Mr Fung Tze Tat of Feoso, he only\n\nreceived B/L No 2, 3 and 4 on 25 December 1999. This was after one Mr Dedopoulos, who\n\nclaimed to represent Seaworld, had told him on 23 and on 24 December 1999 that these bills\n\nhad not been issued with the authority of the shipowners i.e Faith. Mr Fung said that he\n\nhad asked for written confirmation but none was received (see his AEIC paras 36 to 39). He\n\nalso asserted that Ever Bright had given him a copy of the authorisation fax of 17\n\nDecember 1999 from Meridian, which I have cited in para 24 above, together with the B/L No\n\n2, 3 and 4 on 25 December 1999 and it was at the meeting with Ever Bright on that day that\n\nhe first learned of the sub-chartering relationship between Nordic and Persing. He also\n\nsaid in his AEIC (para 40) that on 18 December 1999, seven days earlier, he was told by\n\nHolman Fenwick & Willan, Hong Kong (‘Holman’), who were Feoso’s\n\nsolicitors, that Persing were the head charterers. Mr Fung went on to say in his AEIC that\n\nhe preferred Ever Bright’s assurances/ explanation to the allegation of Mr Dedopoulos\n\nwhom he hardly knew.34.        In\n\ncross-examination, Mr Fung added that on 18 December 1999, Holman had also told him that\n\nthere was a suit between Daphne L and Persing (NE 789). By then, if not before, he should\n\nhave known that Nordic could not be the head-charterers. When this was pointed out to him\n\nin cross-examination, he recanted and said that he was not saying that there was a suit\n\nbetween Daphne L and Persing (NE 790). He also sought to correct para 40 of his AEIC to\n\ndelete any reference to Persing being the ‘head’ charterers.35.        \n\nSecondly, in cross-examination, he admitted that even if Mr Dedopoulos had given a written\n\nconfirmation about the lack of authority regarding the issuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4,\n\nFeoso would nonetheless proceed to collect these bills (NE 793 line 11). Indeed, this was\n\nreinforced by a fax dated 24 December 1999 from Holman to Stephenson Harwood & Co (who\n\nwere acting for Ever Bright) that regardless of the message from Mr Dedopoulos, whom they\n\ndescribed as ‘the vessel interests’, they would recommend Feoso to collect B/L\n\nNo 2, 3 and 4 from Ever Bright, and present them for delivery of the cargo (CB 303).36.        \n\nThirdly, the evidence showed that on 21 December 1999, Seaworld had already sent a fax to\n\nPenavico that B/L No 2, 3 and 4 had not been issued with the authority of the shipowners\n\ni.e Faith. I have already mentioned this in para 28 above. Penavico in turn sent that fax\n\n(and another fax) to Feoso Singapore on 24 December 1999, at 1902 hours. Contrary to Mr\n\nFung’s assertion, Feoso had received written notice that these bills of lading were\n\nissued without authority. It may be that Mr Fung had not read the written notice then or\n\non 25 December 1999 but he and Feoso must have been aware of it soon thereafter. For\n\nexample, soon thereafter, Feoso itself sent copies of Seaworld’s fax and\n\nPenavico’s fax to Ever Bright which in turn forwarded them to Nordic (see CB 318).37.        \n\nWhile Nordic and its solicitors Ince & Co were taking the position that Nordic’s\n\nissuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4 was with the owners’ authority, it was obvious to Feoso\n\nthat the owners were disputing this. Even Persing, from whom Nordic sub-chartered the\n\nVessel, had sent a fax on 27 December 1999 direct to Feoso Hong Kong and to Feoso (the\n\nSingapore company) to inform them that they had never authorised the issuance of B/L No 2,\n\n3 and 4 which did not include both the gross and net weight of the cargo (see CB 314).38.        \n\nFeoso and Faith then sought to resolve the impasse about B/L No 2, 3 and 4. This was done\n\nthrough meetings between their representatives and through exchange of faxes between their\n\nrespective solicitors. In the course of the negotiations, Feoso was represented by Holman\n\nand Faith was represented by Sinclair Roche & Temperly (‘Sinclair’). In the\n\nexchange of faxes, Sinclair had stressed that:(a) Faith had never agreed to the\n\n    issuance of these bills (as their concerns regarding these bills had not been addressed).(b) Meridian was Persing’s\n\n    broker and that Persing had confirmed that no authority was given for the issuance of\n\n    these bills. Indeed, Sinclair went to the extent of obtaining written confirmation of\n\n    these two facts from Clyde & Co, acting for Persing, and forwarding it to Holman (CB\n\n    396, 402, 415).39.        \n\nNotwithstanding the documentary evidence, Holman insisted that B/L No 2, 3 and 4 had been\n\nissued with Faith’s authority. While I accept that the Meridian fax of 17 December\n\n1999 could be interpreted to mean that authority was given for the issuance of these\n\nbills, it must have been obvious by then to both Feoso and Holman that, at most, the\n\nauthority came from Persing, and not Faith, as Meridian was Persing’s broker. I infer\n\nthat the insistent stand taken by Holman was based on the intransigent attitude of Feoso.40.        It\n\nis obvious to me that Feoso relied, and wanted to rely, on B/L No 2, 3 and 4 primarily,\n\nbut not only, because these bills contained the description of the cargo which they wanted\n\ni.e ‘Fuel Oil (3.5S)’ instead of ‘crude oil slops’. The other main\n\nreason was that these bills contained only the net weight and not both the gross weight\n\nand net weight of the cargo. This might have given the impression that there were no\n\nimpurities in the cargo and might have fortified a claim by Feoso for contamination of the\n\ncargo.41.        The\n\nreasons given by Mr Fung about his lack of knowledge of the sub-charter, the reliance on\n\nEver Bright’s assurances and the absence of written confirmation from the owners\n\nabout the lack of authority (for the issuance of B/L No 2, 3 and 4) were all false.42.        I\n\nwould add that when a dispute with Feoso started, Faith obtained advice from BMT Murray\n\nFenton, marine consultants in London, on ALS’ report. The advice dated 4 January 2000\n\nwas that the cargo was fuel oil slops or off-specification fuel oil (CB 374 and 375).43.        In\n\nany event, notwithstanding many proposals made by Sinclair, the impasse was not resolved.\n\nAccordingly, Faith ordered the Vessel to sail from Huangpu on 13 January 2000 to\n\nSingapore. The Vessel reached the Outer Port Limits of Singapore on or about 18 January\n\n2000 and came in on 26 January 2000 (see para 223 of Feoso’s submission, and note the\n\ndifferent date given in para 8 of Feoso’s Amended Statement of Claim). In the\n\nmeantime, Feoso and Faith were unable to reach an interim solution. Eventually, Faith\n\nobtained an order on 1 March 2000 from the High Court of Singapore for the cargo to be\n\nappraised and sold by the Sheriff. The cargo was eventually sold to Kary International\n\nLimited, a company in Hong Kong for US$1,607,638.12. Kary in turn sold the cargo to\n\nQingdao Import and Export Corp of the People’s Republic of Singapore. The cargo was\n\nthen brought to China by another vessel ‘LMZ Dimitra’.44.        \n\nMany issues were raised in the two actions before me but before I deal with them, I should\n\nstate my views on the cargo.",
        "The cargo": "45.\n\n        According to Mr Fung’s evidence, there are\n\nthree broad categories of oil: fuel oil, crude oil and other oil (see his evidence at NE\n\n717, 766). Fuel oil is refined oil and other oil is oil of a poorer quality than refined\n\noil but is not crude oil.46.        \n\nThere are three broad sub-categories of refined oil which fall into 180, 280 and 380 CST\n\nfuel oil with 180 being the highest grade and 380 being the lowest grade (NE 687 and 688).\n\nAccording to the evidence of Faith’s expert, Mr John Tudor Williams, CST is the\n\nstandard of viscosity. It means centistrokes at 50 degrees C. As much reference was made\n\nalso to fuel oil 3.5S, I would mention that this refers to refined fuel oil with a sulphur\n\ncontent of 3.5.47.        \n\nAlthough the detailed specifications in the attachment of the contract between Feoso and\n\nTitan were similar to those in the attachment of the contract between Ever Bright and\n\nFeoso, the cargo description in each contract was different as I have said above i.e 380\n\nCST Fuel Oil as contrasted with heavy crude oil (off-specification). According to Mr\n\nWilliams, the specifications did not fall within the international standards for fuel oil\n\n380 CST, either marine or industrial, because the maximum of 4% for water and sediment\n\nallowed in the specifications was too high. Likewise, the specifications did not fall\n\nwithin the international standard for 280 or 180 CST (NE 257 to 259 Verbatim). In\n\naddition, based on analysis data from load port documents, Mr Williams was of the view\n\nthat the cargo loaded from Kharg Island was a ‘grossly contaminated dirty petroleum\n\nproduct’ (NE 259 Verbatim). This was because of the high water and sediment content\n\nand the ash content as well (NE 268 Verbatim). Mr Haridass had sought to suggest that the\n\nwater content could be removed quite easily but, in my view, that is not the point. The\n\nissue was the nature of the cargo as loaded onto the Vessel and not after it has undergone\n\nsome process.48.        Mr\n\nSirous Alishapour, the then tanker division manager of Sea Express Co Ltd, the loadport\n\nagent, also gave evidence. He was present at Kharg Island throughout the period when the\n\nVessel was loaded between October to 21 November 1999. According to his AEIC, Kharg Island\n\nis one of the largest crude oil terminals in the Persian Gulf and has a large number of\n\nstorage tanks holding crude oil. The cargo loaded on the Vessel originated from a large\n\npit into which residue which built up overtime in the crude oil storage tanks would drain.\n\nOnly slops from the crude oil storage tanks are drained into the pit. The pit was not\n\ncovered and was exposed to the elements. The cargo from the pit was pumped into smaller\n\nvessels which then transferred the cargo to the Vessel. He confirmed in oral testimony\n\nthat he had signed a cargo manifest dated 21 November 1999 describing the cargo as\n\n‘Crude Oil Slops As Per Commercial Invoice’. He was shown a copy of another\n\ncargo manifest dated 30 November 1999, found in Mr Fung’s third affidavit p 69,\n\nreferring to B/L No 2, 3 and 4 and describing the cargo as fuel oil 3.5S, with what\n\nappeared to be his signature, he said the document exhibited in Mr Fung’s third\n\naffidavit was a forgery. There was also evidence from Mr Ali Gahaffari whose AEIC was\n\nadmitted without objection. His evidence was that there are no refineries on Kharg Island\n\nand, for many years, only crude oil was exported from the oil terminals there.49.        Mr\n\nHaridass submitted that when the cargo was shipped on the LMZ Dimitra, the Chinese\n\nauthorities had inspected and found the cargo to be fuel oil. He was suggesting that the\n\ncargo was in fact fuel oil. He relied on a certificate from the authorities dated 18 May\n\n2000 (see para 26 of his closing submission). The English translation is found in CB 527\n\n(and also in Mdm Yu Li’s AEIC p 32). The representative from Qingdao, Mdm Yu Li,\n\nclarified that the words ‘moisture content’ in the English translation should\n\nrefer to ‘water content’.50.        I\n\ndo not accept Mr Haridass’ submission for various reasons. First, although the\n\ndescription of the cargo in the certificate is fuel oil, the test results from the\n\ninspection, as reflected in the certificate, showed the water content to vary from 13.56%\n\nto 23.45%. During cross-examination, Mdm Yu Li said that the test results showed that the\n\ncargo was not homogenous. She also said that if the water content was 13.5% (which was the\n\nminimum water content from the test results) the cargo should be described as fuel oil\n\noff-specification and not fuel oil (NE 857 to 859). She also went on to say that fuel oil\n\n3.5S was a very stable and homogenous product (NE 859 to 860).51.        \n\nBesides the evidence from Mr Williams, Mr Alishapour, Mr Gahaffari and Mdm Yu Li, I took\n\ninto account the fact that there was no reason for Ever Bright’s vendor to describe\n\nthe cargo as heavy crude oil if in fact it was fuel oil. Furthermore, documents from Feoso\n\nreferred to the cargo as crude oil slops eg in a fax dated 7 December 1999 from\n\nFeoso’s Mr Fung to Ever Bright, Mr Fung stated, ‘… we still want to ship\n\nthe cargo of Crude Oil Slops …’ (CB 203/DB 953). When this was pointed out to\n\nhim, he had the audacity to say that in all his past correspondence with Ever Bright, he\n\nhad used ‘crude oil slops’ but there was no special meaning to it and that he\n\nknew that he was buying fuel oil (NE 772).52.        I\n\nalso found it strange that Mr Fung should assert in paras 8 and 9 of his third affidavit\n\nthat the specifications attached to the sale contract with Feoso were for fuel oil 280 CST\n\nbut the contract price represented the market price of 380 CST plus a premium, instead of\n\njust the market price for 280 CST. In any event, during cross-examination, he was unable\n\nto establish that the price Feoso had paid was with reference to the market price of 380\n\nCST, let alone a premium thereon. He then said that he was not involved in the\n\nnegotiations for the price at the relevant time, contradicting paras 9 and 10 of his third\n\naffidavit (NE 688 to 695, 705, 710, 723 to 726, 739 to 742).53.        In\n\nmy view, the cargo was not fuel oil and Feoso had known this all along.",
        "Does Feoso have locus standi to\n\nsue Faith in respect of the cargo?": "54.        \n\nFeoso’s claim against Faith, as pleaded, is based primarily on B/L No 2, 3 and 4 and\n\nalternatively on B/L No 1. Feoso has pleaded B/L No 2, 3 and 4 and, alternatively, B/L No\n\n1, as containing a contract or evidencing a contract for the carriage of the cargo (see\n\nparagraphs 3 and 4 and sub-paragraphs 5(a) and (b) of Feoso’s Amended Statement of\n\nClaim).55.        \n\nSub-sub-paragraphs 5(b)(i) and (ii) of Feoso’s Amended Statement of Claim plead that\n\nFeoso was the holder of B/L No 2, 3 and 4 and that as regards B/L No 1, this was held at\n\nall material times by the solicitors of Nordic as agents and/or trustees of Feoso.56.        \n\nParagraph 7 of Feoso’s Amended Statement of Claim alleges a breach of contract by\n\nFaith and/or a breach of their duty as bailees and/or negligence in Faith’s failure\n\nto deliver the cargo to Feoso at Huangpu or to discharge the cargo into shore tanks at Gui\n\nShan or Huangpu. Paragraph 14 also refers to, inter alia, Faith’s breach of duty\n\nand/or negligence. However, this alleged breach of duty by Faith as a bailee and/or\n\nnegligence was not pursued in Feoso’s closing submission and the question of\n\ndischarging the cargo into shore tanks was raised by Feoso in the context of Faith’s\n\nfailure to mitigate its damages (see para 227 of Feoso’s closing submission).57.        \n\nParagraph 9 of Feoso’s Amended Statement of Claim alleges a conversion and\n\n‘wrongful deprivation’ of the cargo. I assume the latter is part of the claim\n\nfor conversion.58.        \n\nParagraph 10 alleges an unjustifiable deviation but does not specify whether the cause of\n\naction is contract or otherwise. In any event, it was not pursued as a separate cause of\n\naction.59.        \n\nTherefore the two claims of Feoso are really for breach of contract and for conversion.60.        In\n\nthe course of the trial, Mr Haridass had confirmed that Feoso was not claiming any right\n\nunder B/L No 1. Yet in Mr Haridass’ closing submission, he submitted that Faith had\n\nnever specifically asked Feoso to take delivery of the cargo under B/L No 1. Mr Haridass\n\nhad sought to tie this fact with a concern expressed by Sinclair to Faith’s Chinese\n\nlawyers, Henry & Co, about a possible cargo claim by Feoso for misdescription of the\n\ncargo in B/L No 1 if Feoso should present B/L No 1 for delivery. Mr Haridass had sought to\n\npersuade me that Faith’s concern all along was only in respect of a cargo claim and\n\nnot a possible detention of the cargo and the Vessel by Chinese authorities. In my view,\n\nthe fact remained that Feoso did not seek to take delivery of the cargo against B/L No 1,\n\neven though it might have changed its mind subsequently. Furthermore, a concern about a\n\npossible cargo claim does not exclude other concerns like the risk of detention of the\n\ncargo and of the Vessel by Chinese authorities, which I shall elaborate on later.61.        As\n\nfor B/L No 2, 3 and 4, Feoso had placed much reliance on them at the material time in\n\nDecember 1999 and January 2000, and in its pleading and during the trial. It had also\n\nstressed that the Sub CP as well as the Head CP had provided for the issuance of\n\nsubstitute bills although it was only the Sub CP which included the term about changing\n\nthe description of the cargo in the substitute bills. However, when the crunch came, Mr\n\nHaridass accepted, in his closing submission, that B/L No 2, 3 and 4 had been issued\n\nwithout Faith’s authority and were not binding on Faith (para 76 of his submission).62.        \n\nUnder s 2(1) of the Bills of Lading Act (Cap 384), a person who becomes the lawful holder\n\nof a bill of lading shall ‘have transferred to and vested in him all rights of suit\n\nunder the contract of carriage as if he had been a party to that contract’. As Feoso\n\nwas no longer claiming any right under B/L No 2, 3 and 4 or B/L No 1, it could not rely on\n\ns 2(1) to mount its claim against Faith for breach of contract.63.        As\n\nregards the question whether Feoso had a sufficient interest to sue for conversion, Mr\n\nHaridass submitted that Feoso’s claim was not on the basis that B/L No 2, 3 and 4\n\nwere binding on Faith, but on the basis that Faith knew that Feoso were the owners of the\n\ncargo and B/L No 1 had ceased to have any effect because Ince & Co, Nordic’s\n\nsolicitors, and Nordic were not the lawful holders of B/L No 1. In other words, he was\n\nsubmitting that Feoso need not rely on B/L No 1, which was no longer effective, to\n\nestablish that it had the right to immediate possession of the cargo and hence have locus\n\nstandi to sue Faith for conversion.64.        In\n\nmy view, this submission was a turnaround by Feoso. As I have said, Feoso’s Amended\n\nStatement of Claim pleads that B/L No 1 was at all material times held by the solicitors\n\nof Nordic as agents and/or trustees of Feoso. It is one thing to assert that B/L No 1 had\n\nbeen superceded by B/L No 2, 3 and 4 and, alternatively, that B/L No 1 is the effective\n\nbill of lading. It is another to assert that even though B/L No 2, 3 and 4 are invalid for\n\nwant of authority, B/L No 1 was nevertheless ineffective. That latter assertion is not\n\npleaded specifically.65.        I\n\nam aware that in sub-sub-paragraph 5(b)(iii) and (iv) of Feoso’s Amended Statement of\n\nClaim, it is asserted, as an alternative plea, that Feoso was entitled to immediate\n\npossession of the cargo as owners of the cargo. However, these sub-sub-paragraphs come\n\nunder sub-paragraph 5(b) which relies solely on B/L No 1 and the contract thereunder. I am\n\nof the view that Feoso is not entitled to make the submission that B/L No 1 was no longer\n\neffective if B/L No 2, 3 and 4 are invalid.66.        In\n\nany event, I am of the view that B/L No 1 had not ceased to be effective. It had been\n\nvalidly issued. True, all the three bills of B/L No 1 were held by Ince & Co and\n\nNordic had no intention of claiming the cargo. The intention was to surrender B/L No 1 to\n\nA. Bilbrough & Co but it was never surrendered. Depending on the turn of events, Feoso\n\nor someone else to whom B/L No 1 had been endorsed might subsequently have decided to\n\npresent B/L No 1 to claim the cargo.67.        I\n\nnow come to the decision of Justice Judith Prakash in Suit No 1736 of 1999 inSteelmet\n\nPte Ltd v APL Co Pte Ltd. That case involved a claim by the seller of goods against\n\nthe carrier for, inter alia, conversion of the goods. The seller asserted that the carrier\n\nhad released the goods to a third party without production of the original bills of lading\n\nand alleged that the carriers had wrongfully converted the goods. Prakash J pointed out\n\nthat for the seller to sue for conversion, it was not enough for the seller to be the\n\nowner of the goods at the time the suit is commenced. It must also be the person who had\n\nthe right to possess the goods at the time they were converted or misdelivered. In that\n\ncase, the seller had endorsed the bills of lading in favour of various banks. However, the\n\nseller argued that it still had property in the goods and was entitled to possession\n\nbecause the sale of the bills to the banks had been ‘with recourse’. Prakash J\n\nheld that the plaintiff had at the most, retained general property rights which were\n\nsubject to the special property rights of the bank but such general property rights would\n\nnot be sufficient to confer upon the seller the right to sue the carrier in tort for\n\nconversion of the goods because the person who had the immediate right to possession of\n\nthe goods at the time of conversion would have been the banks and not the seller.68.        \n\nHowever, inThe Cherry & Ors[2002] 3 SLR 431, Justice Kan Ting Chiu said that\n\nwhile it was generally accepted that a person who wanted to sue in conversion must have\n\nactual possession or the immediate right to possession at the time of conversion, the rule\n\nwas not inflexible. Relying onBristol & West of England Bank v Midland Railway Co[1891] 2 QB 653, he decided that the title to sue may be transferred from a preceding\n\nparty to the plaintiff after the act of conversion. I understand that his decision is on\n\nappeal to the Court of Appeal.69.        In\n\nany event, in the case before me, Feoso is no longer claiming any right under B/L No 1. In\n\nmy view, Feoso has no locus standi to sue for conversion. I am also of the view that there\n\nwas no conversion by Faith and I shall elaborate on this later.",
        "Faith’s claim for demurrage:\n\nWas the Vessel an arrived ship?": "70.        \n\nFaith’s main claim is for demurrage. It was not disputed that Faith is entitled to\n\nclaim demurrage if the Vessel was an arrived ship and was ready in all respects to\n\ndischarge the cargo. Feoso’s position was that the Vessel was not ready to discharge\n\nthe cargo because Faith had not arranged for the joint inspection for the Vessel. It was\n\nnot disputed that the relevant Chinese law or regulation required such joint inspection to\n\nbe undertaken before the cargo could be discharged.71.        It\n\nwas also not disputed that there is case-law authority that if a step is a mere formality,\n\nthen a vessel may still be ready to discharge her cargo even if that step has not been\n\ncomplied with yet. Some time was spent by the expert on Chinese law from each side as to\n\nwhether the joint inspection was a formality or not.72.        It\n\nis not necessary for me to decide whether the joint inspection was only a formality\n\nbecause I accept Faith’s argument that Feoso is estopped from alleging that the\n\nVessel was not an arrived ship by reason of the fact that there had not been a joint\n\ninspection. I also accept that in the circumstances of the case, it was not reasonable to\n\nexpect Faith to have arranged for joint inspection. My reasons are:(a) the instructions dated 16\n\n    December 1999 that the Master was not to disclose that the cargo was crude oil (see para\n\n    21 to 23 above),(b) the instructions dated 21\n\n    December 1999 that the Master was not to allow any inspection of the cargo (see para 30\n\n    above).Those instructions were given\n\nbecause at that time Feoso preferred to rely on B/L No 2, 3 and 4 (and not B/L No 1),\n\nwhich they have since conceded were issued without the authority of Faith. Although the\n\ninstructions were given by Nordic and not Feoso, I find that they must have been at\n\nFeoso’s behest or with Feoso’s concurrence.73.\n\n        Had the Master of the Vessel proceeded to give\n\nnotice of the arrival of the Vessel with a view to clearing joint inspection, the loadport\n\ndocuments including B/L No 1 would have had to be disclosed and these documents had\n\ndescribed the cargo as crude oil slops. This was to be avoided at all costs as stressed by\n\nthe instructions of 16 December 1999.",
        "Did Faith act reasonably in the\n\ncircumstances and did Faith convert the cargo?": "74.\n\n        As I have mentioned, the question whether Faith\n\nhad acted reasonably during the negotiations and in sailing the Vessel away appears to\n\narise in the context of whether Faith had mitigated its damage. Mr Haridass submitted that\n\nFaith had not acted reasonably for various reasons, which I will attempt to summarise.75.        \n\nFirst, Mr Haridass submitted that Faith itself was prepared to issue another set of bills\n\nof lading (‘the 3rdset’) describing the cargo as ‘Fuel Oil 3.5S\n\nOff Spec’. This demonstrated that Faith had believed from an analysis of the sample\n\nof the cargo, done on its own instructions when the Vessel was in Singapore while en route\n\nto Huangpu, that the cargo was not crude oil slops but fuel oil, although of a quality\n\ninferior to 3.5S. Mr Haridass argued that Faith’s conduct at the material time must\n\nbe seen in this context and not on the basis that subsequently its expert concluded that\n\nthe cargo was crude oil slops. I am of the view that while this may be so, Feoso had, in\n\nany event, never agreed to accept the 3rdset of bills describing the cargo as\n\n‘Fuel Oil 3.5S Off Spec’. Feoso was insisting on delivery against B/L No 2, 3\n\nand 4.76.        \n\nSecondly, Mr Haridass submitted that Faith was being unreasonable in insisting that the 3rdset of bills expressly incorporate a London arbitration clause, as required in its\n\nsolicitor’s (Sinclair’s) fax of 7 January 2000 (CB 413 and 414). However I note\n\nthat in Sinclair’s subsequent fax dated 12 January 2000 (CB 444 and 445), they no\n\nlonger insisted on express incorporation of a London arbitration clause.77.        \n\nThirdly, Mr Haridass submitted that it was unreasonable of Faith to insist through\n\nSinclair, on a condition that any cargo claim which Feoso might bring will be by reference\n\nto the description ‘crude oil slops’ as appeared in B/L No 1 (see\n\nSinclair’s fax dated 7 January 200 at CB 413 and 414, Sinclair’s fax dated 10\n\nJanuary 2000 at CB 425 and 426). He submitted that this was Faith’s unreasonable way\n\nof trying to secure an agreement from Feoso that the cargo was crude oil slops when at the\n\nmaterial time during negotiations Faith no longer believed that the cargo was crude oil\n\nslops because of the analysis done on its instructions when the Vessel was in Singapore.78.        On\n\nthe other hand, Mr Richard Kuek, Counsel for Faith, submitted that this condition was not\n\nan attempt to tie Feoso to the position that the cargo was crude oil slops but instead\n\nthat any claim should proceed on the footing that the initial B/L No 1 described the cargo\n\nas crude oil slops.79.        I\n\nam of the view that it is not open to Feoso to complain about this condition for the\n\nreasons stated below. First, its solicitors Holman had never sought clarification from\n\nSinclair about what this condition meant.80.        \n\nSecondly, Holman did not even ask Sinclair to drop this condition. The entire proposal\n\ninitially made on 7 January 2000, and reiterated on 10 January 2000, was rejected outright\n\nby Holman on 10 January 2000 (CB 428).81.        \n\nThirdly, this condition was not pursued in cross-examination by Mr Haridass except to\n\nestablish that the condition reflected Faith’s concern about a cargo claim (NE 40). I\n\ndo not see anything unreasonable about Faith being concerned about a cargo claim. Indeed,\n\ntheir concern is borne out by the fact that Feoso did initially make a claim for\n\ncontamination of the cargo in the proceedings before me, only to withdraw that claim\n\nduring the trial. I also note that at no time during cross-examination did Mr Haridass\n\nsuggest that the condition was an unreasonable one. Neither did he suggest that it was the\n\nonly or main reason why Holman had rejected the proposal outright. It is obvious to me\n\nthat this argument was a belated excuse to try and justify the allegation that Faith had\n\nnot acted reasonably.82.        \n\nNext, Mr Haridass submitted that Faith could have discharged the cargo while reserving its\n\nrights. This was proposed in a fax by Holman dated 4 January 2000 (CB 367 and 368). I do\n\nnot think that that proposal was reasonable because it was premised on the delivery being\n\nmade against B/L No 2, 3 and 4 which described the cargo as ‘Fuel Oil 3.5S’.\n\nAlso, B/L No 1 had still not been surrendered. Furthermore, what was Faith going to\n\ndeclare the cargo to be? If it was making delivery against B/L No 2, 3 and 4, then, to be\n\nconsistent, the Vessel would have to declare the cargo to be fuel oil 3.5S. However, even\n\nthough Faith was uncertain whether the cargo was crude oil slops, fuel oil\n\noff-specification 3.5S or fuel oil slops (CB 342), it did not take the view that the cargo\n\nwas fuel oil 3.5S.83.        Mr\n\nHaridass also submitted that instead of giving instructions to the Vessel to sail to\n\nSingapore, Faith should have discharged the cargo into bonded storage tanks on-shore at\n\nHuangpu and explained any discrepancy in the documentation between crude oil slops and\n\nfuel oil slops to the relevant authorities, as advised by its own Chinese lawyers Henry\n\n& Co, in their advice dated 30 December 1999 (CB 344 and 345).84.        \n\nHowever, this submission had only looked at part of that advice from Henry & Co in\n\nisolation. Henry & Co had also advised that if there was a discrepancy between the\n\ncargo description in the cargo manifest and/or bill of lading (i.e B/L No 1), and a\n\nprevious cargo declaration, the Chinese customs may consider the case to be one of oil\n\nsmuggling.85.        To\n\ncounter this point, Mr Haridass stressed that Henry & Co had assumed, wrongly, that a\n\nprevious declaration of the cargo had been made to the Chinese authorities and that the\n\nprevious declaration had to be corrected. Accordingly, Henry & Co’s fear about a\n\ncustoms investigation, and consequent detention, of the cargo and the Vessel, was based on\n\nthe wrong premise.86.        I\n\nam of the view that while it is true that there was no prior declaration of the cargo to\n\nthe Chinese authorities, the fact remains that the documents like B/L No 1 and the cargo\n\nmanifest had described the cargo as crude oil slops whereas Faith was thinking of\n\ndeclaring the cargo as fuel oil 3.5S off-specification or fuel oil slops. To make matters\n\nworse, Feoso (the cargo receivers) was bent on declaring or claiming the cargo on the\n\nbasis that it was fuel oil 3.5S. There would be three different descriptions.87.        \n\nMuch time was spent by the Chinese expert on each side as to whether there was a risk of\n\nan investigation and consequent detention of the cargo and the Vessel by the Chinese\n\nauthorities in the circumstances. In summary, Faith’s expert Professor Si Yuzhou said\n\nthat there was a risk of this in the light of Chinese concerns over oil smuggling. Also,\n\nif Faith were to declare the cargo as crude oil slops and no one claimed such a cargo, it\n\nwas likely that Chinese customs would intervene (see paras 44 to 60 of his first AEIC). On\n\nthe other hand, Feoso’s expert Professor Wu Huanning said that there was no risk of\n\ndetention. She saw the problem as a simple one involving discrepancy in documentation only\n\n(see paras 6 and 7 of her second AEIC).88.        Mr\n\nHaridass also sought to neutralise press reports on Chinese concerns over oil smuggling\n\nand the instances cited by Faith’s expert on investigations by the relevant Chinese\n\nauthorities, as well as the detention of the vessel in some instances, as being cases not\n\ndirectly on point. I am of the view that the absence of a case directly on point does not\n\nmean that there was no risk of an investigation and detention.89.        I\n\nam of the view that this was not a case of a typographical error or a mere misdescription\n\nin the bill of lading or other load port documents. As I have said, there would have been\n\nthree different descriptions of the cargo, i.e the description of crude oil slops in B/L\n\nNo 1, the description of fuel oil off-specification (or fuel oil slops) by Faith in its\n\ndeclaration to the Chinese authorities, based on its belief from the sample taken in\n\nSingapore, and Feoso’s description of the cargo as fuel oil 3.5S.90.        \n\nEven if Feoso were to remain silent and Faith was to attempt to discharge the cargo into\n\nbonded warehouses in Huangpu without relying on any cooperation from Faith, there would\n\nstill have been a risk of an investigation or detention.91.        \n\nFirst, even if Faith was not to use any other description and were to stick to the\n\ndescription in B/L No 1 i.e crude oil slops, this would have caused problems because there\n\nwas no receiver with a licence to import such a cargo. Indeed, on 29 December 1999,\n\nPenavico had warned that to declare the cargo as crude oil without the requisite licence\n\nwould put both the Vessel and the cargo at risk of detention (CB 329). Feoso had known all\n\nalong that such a licence was required (see NE 707 and the fax dated 16 December 1999\n\nwhich I have cited in para 21 above). It may be that if Feoso had insisted on delivery of\n\nthe cargo against B/L No 1, Faith would have had no choice but to proceed to declare the\n\ncargo as crude oil slops even though Feoso did not have a licence to import such a cargo.\n\nHowever, Feoso did not require delivery against B/L No 1.92.        \n\nSecondly, if Faith sought to declare the cargo as fuel oil off-specification (or fuel oil\n\nslops), it could not run away from the fact that B/L No 1 had already described the cargo\n\nas crude oil slops. In my view, any attempt by Faith to try and explain the discrepancy\n\nwould have invited an investigation and detention, as asserted by Faith’s expert\n\nProfessor Si Yuzhou in para 56 of his AEIC. I note that even Penavico, the loadport\n\nagents, had advised that Faith should not approach the Chinese authorities to seek their\n\nassistance on such a discrepancy as that would make the matter more complex (CB 569).93.        Mr\n\nHaridass sought to persuade me that there was no risk of investigation or detention\n\nbecause the cargo was eventually successfully brought into China when it was subsequently\n\nshipped on the LMZ Dimitra in May 2000. I am of the view that this submission does not\n\nassist him. In respect of the LMZ Dimitra, the bill of lading had described the cargo as\n\nfuel oil off-specification and not crude oil slops. Secondly, there was no evidence that\n\nthe cargo receiver was insisting on claiming the cargo as fuel oil.94.        In\n\naddition, notice of the Vessel’s arrival was to have been given to the Chinese\n\nauthorities within 24 hours of its arrival. This was not done for reasons I have mentioned\n\nand I do not think it is right for Feoso to suggest that Faith should be blamed for the\n\nomission. This omission made the situation more difficult. I do not agree with Mr\n\nHaridass’ suggestion that allowing Faith to take this factor into account would in\n\nturn suggest that it was acceptable for the Vessel to have omitted to give the notice of\n\narrival and breach Chinese law or regulations. The breach of Chinese law or regulations is\n\nnot in dispute. However, it is a factor that Faith is entitled to take into account in\n\ndeciding what to do in the circumstances.95.        \n\nFurthermore, there was also a dead-line for the cargo receivers, Feoso, to declare the\n\ncargo to the Chinese authorities, i.e. within 14 days from its arrival. This dead-line had\n\nexpired on 4 January 2000 while parties were still negotiating.96.        \n\nEven Feoso’s own expert Professor Wu was of the view that the failure to declare the\n\nVessel to the Chinese authorities upon its arrival and the fact that the Vessel was\n\nsitting in Chinese waters for so long in violation of Chinese law might have given rise to\n\nsuspicions of smuggling (see para 14 of her second AEIC).97.        In\n\nmy view, it was unrealistic for Professor Wu to say that there was no risk of an\n\ninvestigation and detention. There was clearly a risk of such an investigation and\n\ndetention.98.        \n\nHowever, Mr Haridass also submitted that there was no evidence about the length of any\n\npossible detention. On the other hand, Mr Kuek referred me to a Singapore caseWah Yuen\n\nPetroleum Marine Pte Ltd v Hai Yin Diesel Trading Pte Ltdin Suit No 2010 of 1997, a\n\ndecision by Justice Warren Khoo. In that case, the vessel in question was detained by the\n\nChinese authorities for four months although the Chinese authorities eventually concluded\n\nthat the shipowners were innocent of any attempt at smuggling.99.        In\n\nmy view, no one can say for certain how long the Chinese authorities would have detained\n\nthe Vessel, if at all. Even Feoso’s expert witness Professor Wu had to accept that.\n\nAt NE 890 and 891, she said:‘Q Put: When Customs\n\n    suspects smuggling, there is no time limit for them to detain a vessel to conduct an\n\n    investigation as to whether there is smuggling.A You can put it that way. Some\n\n    smuggling cases may be complicated.Q Professor Si’s AEIC para\n\n    49. Are you aware of such cases?A Yes. I have read them in\n\n    newspapers.Q Do you agree with Professor Si\n\n    that the cargoes and/or vessels were detained for several months while investigation was\n\n    continuing?A Sometimes.’100.        In\n\norder to resolve the impasse, Faith had made various offers through Seaworld or Sinclair.101.        By\n\na fax dated 28 December 1999, Seaworld suggested that B/L No 1 be claused with the words\n\n‘Sediment and water content by volume 13.5%’ or ‘Fuel Oil 3.5S Off\n\nSpec’ (CB 321). This was repeated in a fax dated 30 December 1999 from Sinclair (CB\n\n337 and 338) except that Sinclair suggested the issuance of a 3rdset of bills.102.        \n\nThe second offer was dated 6 January 2000 from Sinclair (CB 405 and 407). It was to issue\n\nthe 3rdset of bills describing the cargo as ‘said to be fuel oil (3.5S)\n\npossibly not of homogeneous quality with the other specifications of the cargo stated\n\nherein upon loading at Kharg Island on board the ‘Daphne L’ said to be as per\n\nthe attached Saybolt report of 14 December 1999 and the Saybolt Summary Report of 4\n\nDecember 1999.’103.        \n\nThe third offer was dated 7 January 2000 from Sinclair (CB 413 to 414). It was to describe\n\nthe cargo as ‘said by consignees to be fuel oil 3.5S’ in the 3rdset\n\nof bills. This was reiterated on 10 January 2000 (CB 425 to 426) and again on 12 January\n\n2000 (CB 444 and 445), the last time without any reference to an arbitration provision.104.        \n\nIndeed, Mr Dedopoulos, the Managing Director of Seaworld, said of the 10 January 2000\n\noffer that it was ‘a very generous, and to my opinion, even dangerous for us, to\n\noffer to Feoso ….’. I agree. Any offer by Faith to issue the 3rdset\n\nof bills with a description of the cargo different from that in the other load port\n\ndocuments would not avoid the risk of an investigation and detention. Worse still, such a\n\ndiscrepancy would leave Feoso at risk to accusations of deceiving the Chinese authorities\n\nand conspiracy with Feoso. I do not accept Mr Haridass’ submission that such an offer\n\ndemonstrated that there was no genuine concern on Faith’s part about detention. In my\n\nview, it demonstrated how far Faith was prepared to go to resolve the impasse, but without\n\nsuccess. In any event, none of the offers from Faith were accepted by Feoso.105.        \n\nComing now to another point, Mr Fung in his third affidavit (at para 64) alleged that had\n\nFeoso been given prior notice that the Vessel would sail from Huangpu, it might have\n\nconsidered giving a letter of indemnity to Faith to resolve the impasse. I do not accept\n\nMr Fung’s evidence on this point. In an earlier fax dated 4 January 2000, Holman had\n\nmentioned that they were given to understand that the Vessel might sail away (CB 371).\n\nThis possibility was again raised by Feoso’s new solicitors Huang & Yang Maritime\n\nLaw Office when they sent a fax dated 12 January 2000 to Sinclair to warn them that the\n\nVessel should not sail away (CB 458). While it is true that Faith were at the same time\n\ncontemplating the discharge of the cargo at Huangpu, it was also contemplating leaving\n\nChinese waters as an alternative. Feoso knew this before the Vessel sailed away on 13\n\nJanuary 2000.106.        \n\nFurthermore, on 14 January 2000, Sinclair had sent a fax to Stephenson, which was copied\n\nto Feoso’s new solicitors Huang & Yang Maritime Law Office, stating that Faith\n\nhad no alternative but to mitigate its losses by ordering the Vessel to Singapore (CB 501\n\nand 502). In response, Huang & Yang Maritime Law Office did not come up with any new\n\nsuggestion, let alone a letter of indemnity, and merely invited Faith to discharge the\n\ncargo at Huangpu and threatened Faith that the sailing of the Vessel away was ‘an act\n\nof conversion and possibly theft of the cargo’ (CB 505).107.        It\n\nis all very well for Feoso to now take the position that Faith should have discharged the\n\ncargo and explain the different descriptions pertaining to the cargo to the relevant\n\nChinese authorities and for Faith’s expert to say now that there was no risk of the\n\ncargo and the Vessel being detained for investigation. Yet Feoso had never agreed to\n\nprovide a third party guarantee to Faith in the event that the Vessel was detained (see CB\n\n368). I have no doubt that had Faith attempted to discharge the cargo and if the cargo and\n\nVessel had been detained, Feoso would have been singing a different song. I do not accept\n\nMr Haridass’ submission that the only reason why the Vessel sailed away from Huangpu\n\nwas because of Faith’s fear of a cargo claim.108.        \n\nThere was also the secondary question of whether there was adequate storage space on shore\n\nin Huangpu for the cargo. Although Henry & Co initially advised on 11 January 2000 (CB\n\n454) that there was such storage space, they corrected their opinion on 13 January 2000\n\n(CB 490 and 491). Indeed the loadport agent Penavico had informed Faith that there was no\n\nstorage space for the particular cargo at the material time.109.        On\n\nthe other hand, Mr Fung asserted in para 65 of his third affidavit that such storage space\n\nwas available and that Feoso had concluded a storage agreement with Guangdong (Panyu)\n\nPetrochemical Storage and Transportation Ltd in anticipation of the cargo being delivered\n\non 17 December 1999. However, the documentation he exhibited was not the right one and he\n\nhad to embark on a convoluted explanation and produce some more documents to try and\n\nestablish this assertion (see NE 817 to 820, 822 to 829). It is not necessary for me to\n\nset out his evidence on this point during cross-examination. Suffice it for me to say that\n\nI find his initial evidence in para 65 of his third affidavit to be untrue and his\n\nconvoluted explanation to be unconvincing. In addition, Mr Haridass dropped Feoso’s\n\nclaim for wasted storage costs near the end of the cross-examination on this point (NE\n\n829).110.        \n\nThere was yet another secondary issue as to whether cargo being imported into China could\n\nbe stored in bonded warehouses. On this issue, both the experts disagreed. However it is\n\nnot necessary for me to make a finding on it, in the light of my other findings. The\n\nquestion of storage space was material only if Faith had taken the risk of declaring the\n\nVessel’s arrival and attempted to clear port formalities after lying in Chinese\n\nwaters for over 21 days. I have decided that, in the circumstances, it had acted\n\nreasonably in not doing so.111.        Mr\n\nHaridass also criticised Faith for causing the Vessel to sail to Singapore when at the\n\nrelevant time, Faith knew that there was no storage facility on shore in Singapore to\n\nstore this cargo. However Faith has satisfied me from its documentary evidence that it had\n\nmade many attempts to find such storage facility outside China and was unsuccessful.\n\nIndeed, the evidence showed that Sinclair had sought advice from solicitors in Vietnam,\n\nTaiwan, Jakarta and Manila, both as to the existence of storage space and whether there\n\nwas any legal impediment to bringing in the cargo. The responses were not favourable for\n\none reason or another. Faith’s reason for sailing the Vessel to Singapore was that\n\nthere was a better chance that the relevant storage facility in Singapore would be\n\navailable sooner as ‘Singapore is the place with the largest facilities available for\n\nthis purpose in all Asia ….’ (NE 608 Verbatim). Furthermore, while Mr Haridass\n\nwas criticising Faith for causing the Vessel to sail to Singapore, he did not suggest any\n\nother alternative destination outside of China.112.        Mr\n\nHaridass also made a bare submission that Faith had not proved that it had acted\n\nreasonably in allowing the cargo to remain on board the Vessel for four months after it\n\narrived in Singapore, instead of discharging it into shore tanks. However, Feoso has not\n\npleaded failure to mitigate as regards these four months. Furthermore, I am satisfied from\n\nMr Kuek’s detailed reply submission (para 163 to 164) that Faith had acted reasonably\n\nafter the Vessel arrived in Singapore.113.        In\n\nthe circumstances, I am of the view that, as between Faith and Feoso, Faith had acted\n\nreasonably in sailing the Vessel away to Singapore and in not discharging the cargo into\n\nshore tanks in Singapore. For avoidance of doubt, I am also of the view that there was no\n\nnegligence on the part of Faith.114.        As\n\nfor conversion, Clerk and Lindsell on Torts, Eighteenth Edition, 2000, states at para\n\n14-03 that, ‘The essence of conversion lies in the unlawful appropriation of\n\nanother’s chattel, whether for the defendant’s own benefit or that of a third\n\nparty\". Paragraph 14-25 states that, ‘Mere unpermitted possession … is not\n\na conversion …. But there will be conversion if there is some detention consciously\n\nadverse to the rights of the owner, such as assertion of a lien that does not exist’.\n\nNaturally, the possession or retention must be wrongful before there can be conversion.115.        \n\nParagraph 9 of Feoso’s Amended Statement of Claim states that, ‘… by\n\nfailing and or refusing to proceed to Huangpu or to enter Chinese waters to discharge the\n\nCargo, the Defendants have converted the Cargo for their own use and have wrongfully\n\ndeprived the Plaintiffs thereof’. For the various reasons I have stated, including\n\nthe fact that Feoso did not seek the delivery of the cargo against production of B/L No 1,\n\nI am of the view that there was no act of conversion by Faith.",
        "Quantum of Faith’s demurrage\n\nclaim and alternative claim as gratuitous bailee": "116.\n\n        The Master gave Notice of Readiness about 1237\n\nhours on 21 December 1999. Under Part II Clause 6 of the Head CP, laytime commences six\n\nhours later i.e at 1837 hours of 21 December 1999. Faith claims demurrage up to 2100 hours\n\non 29 April 2000, even though the cargo was completely discharged in Singapore only on 2\n\nMay 2000. The demurrage is US$15,000 a day.117.\n\n        However, the laytime is 96 hours i.e four days.\n\nThe demurrage should therefore start only from 1837 hours on 25 December 1999. As for the\n\nlast date for demurrage, I have learned from Mdm Yu Li’s testimony that the discharge\n\nof the cargo from the Vessel to the LMZ Dimitra was supposed to start on 25 or 26 April\n\n2000 but the boiler of the Vessel was out of order. It took three days to repair it (NE\n\n851). On the other hand, the cargo was completely discharged only on 2 May 2000, as\n\nmentioned above. In the circumstances, I am of the view that Faith is entitled to claim\n\ndemurrage up to 2100 hours of 29 April 2000 as claimed i.e 126.1 days at US$15,000 a day =\n\nUS$1,890,000. However, the sale proceeds from the Sheriff’s sale is US$1,607,638.12\n\nonly.118.\n\n        Accordingly, Faith is making a personal claim\n\nagainst Feoso as stated in para 19 of its Amended Statement of Claim:‘Further or alternatively,if(contrary to the above) the Plaintiff was not entitled to a lien for demurrage and costs,\n\n    it was a gratuitous bailee of the goods and/or preserved the cargo for the benefit of its\n\n    owner ….’[Emphasis added.]119.        \n\nThe alleged costs of preserving the cargo includes costs of using the Vessel for storage,\n\nagency fees at Huangpu, costs of bunkers for sailing from Huangpu to Singapore, port dues,\n\npilotage fees, agency fees and sundries, transportation and communication in respect of\n\nthe Vessel’s call at Singapore, airfare, board and lodging, and legal costs of\n\nvarious solicitors incurred in respect of the negotiations and when the Vessel was in\n\nSingapore from January 2000. Details are set out in para 18 of Faith’s Amended\n\nStatement of Claim. Since I have concluded that Faith is entitled to claim for demurrage\n\nup to 29 April 2000, the question of Faith being a gratuitous bailee no longer arises.\n\nEven though that claim was couched as a further or alternative claim, it was really an\n\nalternative claim.120.        \n\nBesides, in order for Faith to claim as a gratuitous bailee, it is incumbent on Faith to\n\nstate when the contractual bailment ended or when the gratuitous bailment commenced. This\n\nis not asserted in its Amended Statement of Claim. In addition, the evidence demonstrated\n\nthat Faith had never terminated the Head CP or acted on the basis that the Head CP was\n\nterminated prior to 29 April 2000. Instead, it was seeking to perform the Head CP although\n\nin a different manner in view of the difficult circumstances facing it. Hence, its primary\n\nclaim was for demurrage which is consistent with the continuation of the Head CP and not\n\nits termination.121.        In\n\npara 210 of Mr Kuek’s closing submission, he submitted that Faith’s claim as a\n\ngratuitous bailee was on the basis that it was an involuntary bailee of the cargo from the\n\ntime the Vessel arrived in Huangpu to discharge the cargo but found that there was a risk\n\nthat the cargo and the Vessel might be detained by the Chinese authorities. I do not\n\naccept that Faith was an involuntary bailee then. Faith had been warned on 29 December\n\n1999 by Penavico (CB 329) and on 30 December 1999 by Henry & Co (CB 344 and 345) about\n\nthe risk of detention. Yet, it was still making proposals to discharge the cargo at\n\nHuangpu until the Vessel sailed away. I have also considered whether Faith could have\n\nbecome a gratuitous bailee when the Vessel sailed from Huangpu to Singapore but that was\n\nnot the basis of Faith’s claim as gratuitous bailee. Neither its pleadings, nor its\n\nevidence nor its closing submission presented its claim on that basis.122.        \n\nAccordingly, it is not necessary for me to decide whether Faith is entitled to claim as\n\ngratuitous bailee against Feoso as bailor for the costs of keeping the cargo on board the\n\nVessel, and the other costs enumerated in para 18 of Faith’s Amended Statement of\n\nClaim, in circumstances where there was no previous contractual relationship between Faith\n\nand Feoso. It is also not necessary for me to decide whether such a claim, if allowed,\n\nshould be restricted to the value of the cargo.",
        "Is Faith entitled to a lien for\n\ndemurrage and other costs and what is the effect of the lien?": "123.        It\n\nis not sufficient for Faith to establish a claim for demurrage as there is no contractual\n\nrelationship between Faith and Feoso. Accordingly, Faith claims that it is entitled to a\n\nlien for demurrage, as well as for other costs.124.        \n\nThe Head CP provides:‘H. Total Laytime in Running\n\n    Hours: 96 hours total load/discharge.I. Demurrage per Day: U.S.\n\n    Dollars 15,000 per day or prorata.’125.        \n\nClause 6 of Part II of the Head CP states:‘6. NOTICE OF READINESS.\n\n    Upon arrival at customary anchorage at each port of loading or discharge, the Master or\n\n    his agent shall give the Charterer or his agent notice by letter, telegraph, wireless or\n\n    telephone that the vessel is ready to load or discharge cargo, berth or no berth, and\n\n    laytime, as hereinafter provided shall commence on the expiration of six (6) hours after\n\n    receipt of such notice ….’126.        \n\nClause 21 of Part II of the Head CP states:‘21. LIEN. The Owner shall\n\n    have an absolute lien on the cargo for all freight, deadfreight,demurrage and costs,\n\n    including attorney fees, of recovering the same, which lien shall continue after delivery\n\n    of the cargo into the possession of the Charterer, or of the holders of any Bills of\n\n    Lading covering the same or of any storageman.’[Emphasis added.]127.        \n\nClause 1 of the Conditions of Carriage on B/L No 1 (obverse side) provides:‘All terms and conditions,\n\n    liberties and exceptions of the Charter Party,dated as overleaf, are herewith\n\n    incorporated ….’[Emphasis added.]The front side of B/L No 1\n\nreferred to a Charterparty dated 13 October 1999 but no other description. This was the\n\ndate of the Head CP as well as the Sub CP.128.\n\n        Mr Kuek submitted that the words in clause 1\n\nwere wide enough to incorporate the lien provision in the Head CP on the authority of Mr\n\nJustice Mustill’s judgment inThe Miramar[1983] 2 LLR 319 and Judicial\n\nCommissioner Chan Seng Onn’s judgment inThe Trade Resolve[1999] 4 SLR 424.\n\nMr Haridass did not dispute this. He also accepted that where two or more charterparties\n\nof the same date could be incorporated, the case-law authorities suggest it is the head\n\ncharter-party that is incorporated.129.\n\n        However, para 11 of Feoso’s Re-Amended\n\nDefence asserts that even if the terms of the Head CP were incorporated into B/L No 1,\n\nFaith would still not be able to claim demurrage because of additional clause 4 of the\n\nHead CP as the Vessel did not proceed to Huangpu to discharge the cargo by reason of\n\nFaith’s failure to arrange for a joint inspection of the vessel which is a mandatory\n\nrequirement under Chinese law and/or regulation or a custom of Chinese ports, and which,\n\nwhen passed, would enable the vessel to enter the port limits of Huangpu and become an\n\narrived ship.130.\n\n        I do not think the additional Clause 4 adds\n\nanything. It states:‘4. LAYTIME & N.O.R.In the event Laytime has expired,\n\n    Charterer shall be allowed the benefits of Clauses 6 and 7 of Part II at each port of\n\n    loading or discharge before demurrage shall be incurred.Notice of Readiness given\n\n    pursuant to Part II Clause 6, shall not be deemed to be received by Charterer or\n\n    charterer’s Agent prior to the date stipulated in Part I (B) for commencing laydays\n\n    except with charterer’s sanction.’I have already cited the material\n\npart of Clause 6 of Part II. As for the omitted part, it refers to the vessel arriving at\n\na berth but this is irrelevant (as conceded by para 38 of Feoso’s closing submission)\n\nbecause the cargo was to be unloaded by ship-to-ship transfer. As for Clause 7 of Part II,\n\nthis is also irrelevant as it pertains to the hours of loading and discharging which is\n\nnot in issue.131.\n\n        Accordingly, I am of the view that the\n\nreference to a charterparty dated 13 October 1999 was to the Head CP and that the lien\n\nprovision for demurrage and costs was incorporated into B/L No 1.132.\n\n        However, Mr Haridass submitted that as there\n\nwas no contract between Faith and Feoso and as Feoso is not the holder of B/L No 1, Faith\n\ncannot rely on the contractual lien as against Feoso. At best, Faith can only exercise a\n\nlien at common law and at common law, there is no lien for demurrage but only for general\n\naverage and costs and expenses of preserving goods and freight. Such costs and expenses do\n\nnot include the cost of keeping the cargo on board the Vessel in the meantime (paras 14 to\n\n16 of his closing submission). This submission assumes that Feoso can claim the cargo from\n\nFaith without relying on B/L No 1, and hence avoid the lien provision, just because it is\n\nthe owner of the cargo. I would add that it is not disputed that Feoso is the owner of the\n\ncargo (see, for example, CB 320 and 502 and NE 62).133.\n\n        I am of the view that although Feoso is the\n\nowner of the cargo, this does not mean that vis--vis Faith, it is entitled to delivery\n\nof the cargo without more. Faith’s obligation, as the owner of the Vessel, is to\n\ndeliver the cargo against production of the relevant bill of lading i.e B/L No 1 (see\n\nScrutton on Charterparties and Bills of Lading, Twentieth Edition 1996, p 295). Unless\n\nFeoso produces B/L No 1, it is not entitled to take delivery of the cargo. The fact that\n\nit is the owner of the cargo does not alter its position vis--vis Faith. However, if,\n\nfor example, Ever Bright had presented B/L No 1 and obtained the cargo, it would then be\n\nopen to Feoso, as the owner of the cargo (who had paid for the cargo) to claim it from\n\nEver Bright. Naturally, should Feoso base its claim to take delivery of the cargo from\n\nFaith under B/L No 1, it would then be caught by the lien provision. Accordingly, the fact\n\nthat the lien provision does not per se extend to Feoso does not mean that Feoso is\n\nentitled to take delivery of the cargo from Faith free of the lien.134.\n\n        Mr Haridass also submitted that Faith had not\n\nclaimed a lien for demurrage earlier, although Faith had made claims for demurrage. In my\n\nview, the validity of the lien does not depend on an earlier assertion of the lien. So\n\nlong as Faith has not released its possession of the cargo, it is entitled to assert its\n\nlien. As I have mentioned, the cargo was eventually sold pursuant to a court order, but\n\nunder the order, all rights of lien were transferred to the proceeds of sale.135.\n\n        In the circumstances, Faith is entitled to a\n\nlien on the cargo. However, the nature of a lien is a passive right to retain the cargo\n\nuntil payment is made. It is a right of defence and is not a right of action in itself\n\n(Halsbury’s Laws of England 4thEd, Reissue, Vol 28, para 745 and 719).\n\nTherefore, it does not necessarily follow that just because Faith is entitled to a lien,\n\nFaith is entitled to the cargo or the proceeds of sale of the cargo.136.\n\n        In theMiramar, the parties had reached\n\nan interim agreement to resolve a deadlock. The interim agreement was contained in a\n\nletter dated 11 July 1980 under which the consignee of the cargo agreed to pay, up to a\n\nmaximum sum, any sums in respect of which the carrier was entitled to exercise a lien and\n\nin exchange the carrier agreed to lift its lien.137.\n\n        InThe Trade Resolve, the court\n\nconcluded at para 77, ‘As the blended oil cargo on board the vessel was ordered to be\n\nsold and the proceeds of sale paid into court, I accordingly declared that the defendants\n\nwere entitled to the lien on the cargo,and hencethe sale proceeds, for their\n\nunpaid demurrage and costs but not including the detention charges’ (emphasis added).\n\nThis appears to equate a lien on cargo with an entitlement to cargo but it may be that the\n\npoint was not argued before the court.138.\n\n        In the present case before me, there was\n\nlikewise no argument that even if Faith is entitled to a lien for demurrage and\n\nFeoso’s claim to the cargo is subject to the lien, Faith is nevertheless still not\n\nentitled to the cargo or the sale proceeds. There was no argument that in such a\n\nsituation, the sale proceeds would have to simply remain where they are. Indeed, para 30\n\nof Feoso’s Re-Amended Defence accepts that if Faith is entitled to a lien, it can\n\nrecover the sale proceeds of the cargo but no more. In the circumstances, I will not deny\n\nFaith the sale proceeds of the cargo.139.\n\n        In so far as Faith has claimed a lien for\n\ndemurrage and other costs under clause 21 of Part II of the Head CP, the details of such\n\nother costs are set out in para 18 of Faith’s Amended Statement of Claim. As the\n\ndemurrage I have allowed exceeds the quantum of the sale proceeds, the items claimed as\n\nother costs are academic and it is not necessary for me to decide whether each of such\n\nitems should be allowed.",
        "Orders": "140.        In\n\nrespect of Admiralty in Personam No 32 of 2000, I declare that Faith is entitled to\n\nexercise a lien for US$1,890,000 with interest thereon at the rate of 6% per annum from\n\nthe date of Faith’s action to date of judgment. I order that the sale proceeds of the\n\ncargo and any interest thereon be released to Faith in part settlement of the lien.141.        In\n\nrespect of Admiralty in Rem No 21 of 2000, I dismiss Feoso’s claims against the Owner\n\nof the Vessel.142.        I\n\nwill hear the parties on costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSINGAPOREADMIRALTY IN PERSONAM NO 32 OF\n\n2000ADMIRALTY IN REM NO 21 OF 2000ANNEXURE TO JUDGMENT OF WOO BIH LI\n\nJC DATED 1 OCTOBER 2002Copyright © Government of Singapore."
