        "7 April 1997 – 1stConsultation": "7.    On 7 April 1997, Mr Harte decided to consult the 1stdefendant, Dr Tan Hun Hoe (‘Dr Tan’), who is a specialist urologist and a renal\n\ntransplant surgeon in Singapore. Dr Tan’s private clinic is known as H H Tan Urology\n\nCentre Pte Ltd., which was then located at unit #04-03 on the 4thstorey of the\n\nGleneagles Medical Centre. Gleneagles Medical Centre is located next to Gleneagles\n\nHospital (‘hospital’), which is owned and managed by the 2nddefendants. Dr Tan is an accredited surgeon with the hospital and has an arrangement,\n\nwhereby he may perform his surgical operations on his private patients using the\n\nhospital’s facilities. At all material times, Mr Harte was a private patient of Dr\n\nTan.8.    At the first consultation in Dr Tan’s clinic,\n\nMr Harte informed Dr Tan of his left varicocelectomy by Dr Dubin. He told Dr Tan that no\n\nseminal analysis was done since to determine how effective that surgery was. Dr Tan\n\ntherefore requested for a seminal analysis. On clinical examination, Dr Tan found that:(a) there was no abnormality in his genitalia;(b) his testes were of normal size and consistency;(c) there wasno varicoceleor hydrocele.9.    The seminal test results dated 8 April 1997 from\n\nSheng Yu Laboratory revealed that Mr Harte had a sperm count of 29.5 million per ml (the\n\nnormal level being about 20 million per ml) and a good volume of ejaculate of 4 mls after\n\nabstinence of 5 days (the normal level being between 1 to 6 mls). However, the sperm\n\nmotility was 35 % (the normal level being equal or above 40%). Normal forms were only 3 %\n\n(the normal level being equal or greater than 30%). The laboratory classified his sperm\n\nquality as \"Asthenozoospermia (reduction in the vitality of spermatozoa) with severe\n\nteratozoospermia (the presence of deformed spermatozoa).\" The laboratory’s\n\ncomment was \"Adequate volume of semen showed low % sperm motility and low % normal\n\nforms with high % tail defects.\"10.    Instead of improving, the normal forms had in\n\nfact dropped from 15% to some 3% after Dr Dubin’s operation. Based on this seminal\n\nanalysis, Dr Dubin agreed that there was no improvement after the operation. In his\n\nopinion, about 15% of cases would not show improvement after a varicocelectomy.",
        "14 April 1997 - Dr Tan’s letter to Dr Wun": "11.    On 14 April 1997, Dr Tan wrote to Dr Winnie Wun,\n\nthe gynaecologist whom Mrs Harte was consulting for her own fertility problems. Dr Wun had\n\nrecommended Dr Tan to them. As this letter indicates the then state of mind of Dr Tan and\n\nreveals his contemporaneous medical conclusions, it featured in my assessment of whether\n\nDr Tan was negligent in recommending a bilateral varicocelectomy operation for Mr Harte. I\n\ntherefore set it out in full.Dear Dr. Wun,Re: Denis M. Harte M/32Thank you for referring Denis, husband of your patient Michelle.He gave a history of left variocelectomy in New York in June ’96\n\n  anda thermal scan subsequently showed improvement.Clinicallyno abnormality was detectablein his genitalia. Both\n\n  testicles were of normal size and consistency.There was no evidence of varicocele.A 3 D [Three Dimensional] TransRectal Ultrasound Scan revealed anormal\n\n  prostate and ejaculatory ducts.Both seminal vesicles were distended but he had\n\n  abstained for 5 days.A S.A. [Seminal Analysis] revealedAsthensozoospermia with severe\n\n  Teratozoospermia. Volume and density was adequate.A Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scancould be usefulin view of\n\n  the above findings.Will keep you informed.Warmest regards,(Signed Dr Tan Hun Hoe)12.    It appears that Dr Tan was hoping to find the\n\ncause or source of the infertility using the Colour Doppler Ultrasound Scan\n\n(‘CDUS’) after he failed to detect any varicocele clinically. Having checked\n\nthat the prostate and ejaculatory ducts were normal, what then was the cause of his poor\n\nsperm quality? I do not find that Dr Tan’s further investigations using the CDUS can\n\nbe regarded as exceptional, wrong or negligent. I do not expect a doctor to stop his\n\ninquiries simply because the clinical investigation has failed to locate the source of the\n\nproblem. I expect him to continue with other tests, aids and investigating techniques in a\n\nsystematic manner, whether with or without special instruments, to find the cause and\n\nresolve the patient’s medical problem if he can.13.    I thus reject the opinion of the plaintiff’s\n\nexperts that it was wrong for Dr Tan to use a CDUS to detect varicoceles simply because no\n\nvaricocele was detected clinically or that the CDUS was too sensitive an equipment for\n\ndetection of varicoceles. The following medical literature supports the use of ultrasound\n\nequipment to detect clinical and subclinical varicoceles:(a) Evaluation and Management of the Infertile Male: What’s New\n\n  and What’s Important (Interactive) by Goldstein, Pryor and Schlegel.(b) Clinical versus Subclinical Varicocele: Improvement in Fertility\n\n  after Varicocelectomy by Dhabuwala, Hamid and Moghissi.(c) Correlation of Testicular Color Doppler Ultrasonography, Physical\n\n  Examination and Venography in the Detection of Left Varicoceles in Men with Infertility by\n\n  Petros, Middleton and Picus.14.    The caveat I have is that instruments must always\n\nbe correctly used and the results obtained must be properly interpreted in the light of\n\nthe peculiar limitations and characteristics of the instruments. Full regard must also be\n\ngiven to clinical observations and other investigations performed. After that, a carefully\n\nconsidered medical judgment is called for whether to recommend proceeding with the\n\noperation or not, taking into account the risks involved in that particular type of\n\noperation and weighing them against other alternative courses of therapy (i.e. without the\n\noperation). Depending on the condition of the patient and the amount of information sought\n\nby the patient, the doctor must use his clinical judgment to decide what and how much he\n\nshould tell the patient of the various risks, the pros and cons of each viable option and\n\nthen, he has to objectively present and explain them to his patient, taking account of the\n\npatient’s level of understanding and interest in the matter, so that the patient will\n\nhave enough information to make the final decision.15.    Mr Harte complained that had he seen the letter\n\nto Dr Wun, he would not have agreed to the operation because Dr Tan had found no evidence\n\nof varicocele. He would have sought a second opinion. To my mind, that was with the\n\nbenefit of hindsight.",
        "15 April 1997 – 2ndConsultation": "16.    On 15 April 1997, Mr and Mrs Harte saw Dr Tan\n\nagain. They handed to him copies of his surgery reports and other medical documents\n\npertaining to his first varicocelectomy as well as some medical literature provided by Dr\n\nDubin.17.    I will digress a little to deal with the medical\n\nliterature first. I presumed that Mr and Mrs Harte had read these articles and were not\n\ncompletely ignorant when they discussed their fertility problems with Dr Tan.18.    I note that the article published in November\n\n1977, ‘Varicocelectomy: 986 Cases in a twelve-year study’ by Dubin and\n\nAmelar had stated, \"We have also performedreoperationsin 5 other patients\n\nwho had previously had varicocelectomy by other physicians with recurrence: 3 of the 5 had\n\nimprovement in semen quality and pregnancy. These cases are not included in this reported\n\nseries.\" Therefore, variocelectomyreoperationsare not something unknown\n\nor exceptional.19.    Another article published in May 1987, ‘Right\n\nvaricocelectomy in selected infertile patients who have failed to improve after previous\n\nleft varicocelectomy’also by Dubin and Amelar, reported that \"Most\n\nrecently in 1986, McClure and Hricak studied 50 infertile men using scrotal sonography and\n\nfound that 24 (48%) had bilateral varicoceles asdetected with ultrasound(as\n\nopposed to an 8 % incidence of bilateral varicoceles in fertile controls.)\" This\n\nshows that using ultrasound to detect varicoceles is not inappropriate as an aid for\n\ndiagnosing such a condition. In my opinion, it is a useful diagnostic tool if used\n\ncorrectly. The authors, Dubin and Amelar, had not commented that it was wrong to do so.\n\nHowever, for their own practice they said:The clinical diagnosis of varicocele is not always a simple matter. In\n\n  our practice we rely on careful palpation. Contact scrotal thermography using the Clark\n\n  Topical Thermograph (Clark Research and Development, Inc., New Orleans, LA) has been a\n\n  useful supplemental diagnostic tool, but for this study we have relied entirely on our\n\n  careful palpation for making the decision about whether or not a patient had a varicocele\n\n  and whether it was small, moderate, or large in size.Patients must be examined in the upright position because all but very\n\n  large varicoceles will be overlooked because of venous decompression if the patient is\n\n  supine. Reflux of blood down the internal spermatic veins into the scrotum should be\n\n  determined by careful palpation of both left and right spermatic cords while the standing\n\n  patient performs the Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver is extremely important because small\n\n  varicoceles will not be diagnosed without it, and correct bilateral therapy will not be\n\n  suggested.If by this method of careful palpation we cannot detect a varicocele,\n\n  we do not diagnose a varicocele in that patient. We have not subscribed to the existence\n\n  of the so-called subclinical varicocele that cannot be detected by careful palpation with\n\n  the Valsalva maneuver.20.    The authors were clearly concerned that small\n\nvaricoceles were not missed, although they did not think that these small varicoceles\n\nwould escape a careful palpation with the Valsalva maneuver. Thus they preferred the\n\nclinical approach even for small varicoceles whereas as I see it, others might well prefer\n\nusing the CDUS as an aid in detection.21.    In the third article given to Dr Tan by Mr Harte,\n\n‘Varicocelectomy: Twenty-five Years of Experience’,published in 1988, it\n\nrecognised that the modification of the Ivanissevich procedure is simple and theaverage\n\nsurgeon can achieve excellent results. In this procedure, the inguinal incision is\n\nmade over the internal inguinal ring. An incision is made in the external oblique muscle\n\nthrough the external inguinal ring. The spermatic cord there is then dissected free.\n\nFinally, the internal spermatic veins are ligated and partially excised at the internal\n\ninguinal ring.In recent years, the procedure has been further modified by ligating the\n\nveins even lower at the level just below the external ring. However, the article\n\ncautioned that the artery, the external spermatic veins, and the vasal veins should not be\n\nligated in this procedure. Table II of the article shows very few incidents of\n\npost-operative complication, which attest to the benign nature of the surgery. None of the\n\nvaricocelectomy operations involving 986 men resulted in a disastrous post-operative\n\ncomplication of testicular atrophy.22.    The article went on to say that surgery is\n\nindicated by poor sperm motility and immaturity,andthe presence of\n\nvaricocele. Varicocele is established by a large body of evidence as a major cause of male\n\ninfertility. Where the varicocele cannot be demonstrated by palpation orcrude doppler\n\ntechniques,the temptation to ligate the internal spermatic vein in patients with poor\n\nsperm motility and morphology must be resisted. This suggests that where an ultrasound\n\ndoppler scan as an alternative confirmatory test to palpation does confirm the presence of\n\nvaricocele in a man with poor semen quality, it is in order to proceed with a\n\nvaricocelectomy operation. Therefore, the contention that it was wrong for Dr Tan to have\n\noperated is without foundation if the CDUS that Dr Tan requested for had indeed detected a\n\nvaricocele condition.23.    On 15 April 1997, Dr Koay Lok Hin, a radiologist\n\npractising at Gleneagles Hospital, performed the scrotal ultrasound scan with Mr Harte\n\nlying supine. Dr Koay’s brief report stated the following:COLOUR DOPPLER U/S OF TESTESBoth testes show normal size and parenchymal echogenicity. No evidence\n\n    of abnormal focal intratesticular lesions is seen.Both heads of epididymis appear normal.There is evidence ofintermittentvaricoceles demonstrable on\n\n    the left side on valsalva manoeuvre.Very early minimal intermittentvaricoceles is\n\n    noted on the right side on valsalva manoeuvre.COMMENTSIntermittentvaricoceles noted on the left side.24.    Mr Harte admitted being told by Dr Tan that the\n\nCDUS revealed a varicocele recurrence on the left side, and a varicoceleformingon\n\nthe right. Dr Tan further read, explained and showed him the radiological report. I cannot\n\nfind any deliberate concealment or misrepresentation of the CDUS results by Dr Tan. Mr\n\nHarte’s complaint was apparently about Dr Tan’s failure to disclose that he did\n\nnot find any varicoceleclinically.25.    Based on the CDUS, Dr Koay explained that he\n\nfound evidence of varicocele on the left side and very mild varicocele on the right side.\n\nDr Tan’s interpretation and explanation to Mr Harte of the CDUS report was thus\n\nfundamentally correct.26.    Dr Tan wrote on 16 April 1997 to Dr Wun informing\n\nher that Mr Harte’s CDUS revealed ‘recurrence/persistence of the left\n\nvaricocele.’ He noted that only two branches of the internal spermatic veins were\n\nligated previously and suggested a repeat varicocelectomy at alower levelfor Mr\n\nHarte to consider.27.    This letter significantly corroborates Dr\n\nTan’s oral evidence that he operated at a different site from that operated by Dr\n\nDubin. Dr Tan testified that he operated at a lower part of the spermatic cord. Thus the\n\nproblems alluded to by the plaintiff’s experts of the dangers or increased risks of\n\nre-operating on the same part of the spermatic cord do not apply.28.    According to the plaintiff, Dr Tan advised them\n\nto have a second varicocelectomy to enhance his fertility. He remarked that Dr Dubin had\n\nbeen too conservative. Dr Tan said that he still had a left varicocele and a varicocele\n\nwas developing on the right as well. Even after Dr Dubin’s surgery, the quality of Mr\n\nHarte’s sperm had not improved. So he advocated a bilateral varicocelectomy because\n\nthe infertile condition was due to bilateral varicoceles. I have no doubt that Mr and Mrs\n\nHarte relied on the advice of Dr Tan and consequently, consented to the bilateral\n\nvaricocelectomy.29.    Dr Tan assured them that there would be no\n\ncomplications following the day surgery other than some minor swelling and general\n\ndiscomfort lasting just a few days. Mr Harte was not surprised because he had experienced\n\nthese normal side effects after his previous varicocelectomy in New York. Dr Tan however\n\ndid not mention any risks inherent in the surgery.30.    The plaintiff alleged that Dr Tan was negligent\n\nin omitting to advise him that he could suffer a scrotal haemotoma, atrophy of his testes,\n\nbe incapable of producing sufficient testosterone or cease to produce sperm altogether.\n\nHad Dr Tan done that, he would not have gone for the operation.31.    In my judgment, the risk of testicular atrophy is\n\nentirely remote as a normal consequence of such a simple surgery. An omission to mention\n\nsome fanciful and very remote risk does not constitute a negligent omission. Just as death\n\nis a possibility in every surgery however minor, I do not think that a surgeon will be\n\nregarded as negligent when he omits to mention death as a possible risk in a\n\nvaricocelectomy, if in fact death unfortunately occurs. The House of Lords inSidaway v\n\nBoard of Governors of the Bethlem Royal Hospital and Maudsley Hospital and Others[1985] 2 WLR 480 specifically addressed the question of non-disclosure of risks and the\n\nduty to inform. By a majority of 4 to 1, House of Lords held that theBolamtest\n\napplied not only to the diagnosis and treatment of a patient, but also extended to the\n\ngiving of medical advice. Hence, the question whether an omission to warn a patient of the\n\ninherent risks of an operation constitutes a breach of the surgeon’s care towards his\n\npatient is to be determined by an application of theBolamtest. However, Lord\n\nBridge added the following important caveat:..even in a case where, …, no expert witness in the relevant\n\n  medical field condemns the non-disclosure as being in conflict with accepted and\n\n  responsible medical practice, I am of opinion that the judge might in certain\n\n  circumstances come to the conclusion that disclosure of a particular risk was so obviously\n\n  necessary to an informed choice on the part of the patient that no reasonably prudent\n\n  medical man would fail to make it. The kind of case I have in mind would be an operation\n\n  involving asubstantial riskof grave adverse consequences, asfor\n\n  example, the ten per cent riskof a stroke from the operation which was the\n\n  subject of the Canadian case ofReibl, v. Hughes, 114 D.L.R. (3d) 1. In such a\n\n  case, in the absence of some cogent clinical reason why the patient should not be\n\n  informed, a doctor, recognising and respecting his patient’s right of decision, could\n\n  hardly fail to appreciate the necessity for an appropriate warning.32.    In this case, the plaintiff called no medical\n\nexpert to condemn the non-disclosure by Dr Tan of the possible risk of atrophy. This\n\nindicates perhaps that hardly any urologist would think that such a warning is called for.\n\nProbably, the majority hold the contrary view. I doubt for instance that Dr Dubin ever\n\nmentioned that risk to Mr Harte prior to his left varicocelectomy surgery. Otherwise, why\n\nwould Mr Harte be ignorant if Dr Dubin had previously apprised him of it? As the risk of\n\natrophy of the testes in a varicocelectomy is so remote and negligible, I do not regard it\n\nas being so obviously necessary that no reasonably prudent urologist would fail to\n\ndisclose it. As such, Dr Tan is not negligent even if he had not told Mr Harte of the risk\n\nof testicular atrophy.33.    Is the bilateral varicocelectomy with a repeat\n\nsurgery on the left side at a different level, a radical and experimental treatment by Dr\n\nTan? Having perused the medical literature tendered, I think not.34.    A further complaint by Mr Harte is that no advice\n\nwas given of any other treatment as an alternative to the bilateral varicocelectomy\n\nalthough he and his wife had specifically asked Dr Tan whether other options were\n\navailable. Dr Tan told them that bilateral varicocelectomy was the only solution.35.    I do not believe that Dr Tan would have been so\n\nadamant about the operation being the only solution. Mr Harte exaggerated his evidence\n\nsomewhat in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief. It is more likely in my view for Dr Tan to\n\nhave recommended bilateral varicocelectomy operation as theirbestoption, which\n\nimplied that there were indeed other options although Dr Tan might not have enumerated\n\nthem. In court, Mr Harte moderated his evidence somewhat and testified that Dr Tan told\n\nhim that thebestoption would be bilateral varicocelectomy but no other\n\nalternatives were offered.36.    With the history of their fertility problems and\n\nthe medical literature they had, surely they must have known of the existence of test-tube\n\nbabies, in vitro fertilization and a myriad of other similar methods besides varicocele\n\noperations. In fact, Dr Dubin himself mentioned in vitro fertilization to the couple. I\n\nfind it hard to believe their ignorance of other options even if it were true that Dr Tan\n\nhad not apprised them of their existence and availability. I conclude that no negligence\n\nhas arisen out of the purported failure of Dr Tan to apprise them of other options.37.    Prior to leaving Dr Tan’s office on 15 April\n\n1997, Mr and Mrs Harte asked Dr Tan whether they should store some sperm in a sperm bank\n\nbefore the operation in case something went wrong after the operation. Dr Tan dismissed it\n\nas he was confident that nothing would go wrong in the surgery.38.    Assuming that Dr Tan had given that advice, I do\n\nnot consider that he had acted negligently because testicular atrophy is clearly not a\n\nforeseeable consequence of a simple benign operation like varicocelectomy where an average\n\nsurgeon can achieve excellent results let alone an expert urologist like Dr Tan who has\n\nhad many years of experience and who has performed 200 of such operations without a single\n\ncase of atrophy. If it were a reasonable precaution that should normally be taken, and\n\nadvice was given to the contrary, then there might be grounds to allege negligence on Dr\n\nTan’s part for having given that advice which was relied on and followed by the\n\nplaintiff.39.    As Dr Tan felt that storage of Mr Harte’s\n\nsemen was of no benefit since his semen was of such poor quality anyway, it was not an\n\nunreasonable basis upon which to advise against the necessity of sperm banking. If the\n\nworst possible foreseeable outcome is a nil improvement in sperm quality, and since fresh\n\nsemen for any artificial insemination is generally preferred over thawed out deep frozen\n\nsemen, it is a fair and rational advice as far as I can see. I also note that sperm\n\nbanking prior to varicocelectomy is not a routine procedure with all the major hospitals\n\nin Singapore.40.    In any event, if Mr and Mrs Harte had wanted to,\n\nthey could have gone to the sperm bank themselves to bank some of Mr Harte’s sperm\n\nand pay for it separately, without any need to obtain the green light from Dr Tan. There\n\nis nothing to stop them from doing so.41.    There was also the argument raised that\n\nsubclinical varicocele ought to be left alone and hence, Dr Tan should not have operated\n\nto remove the subclinical varicocele. The following papers point to the contrary that the\n\ndetection of subclinical varicocele may be warranted in infertile men with abnormal sperm\n\nand that its treatment may have some beneficial effect on spermatogenesis:(a) Subclincal Varicocele: The Effectiveness of Varicocelectomy by\n\n  McClure, Khoo, Jarvi and Hricak(b) Effect of Varicocelectomy on Sperm Parameters and Pregnancy Rate in\n\n  Patients with Subclinical Varicocele: A Randomized Prospective Controlled Study by\n\n  Yamamoto, Hibi, Hirata, Miyake and Ishigaki.(c) Effectiveness of subclinical varicocelectomy: a prospective\n\n  randomized study by Okuno, Shichiri, Onishi and Yoshida.(d) Evaluation and Management of the Infertile Male: What’s New\n\n  and What’s Important (Interactive) by Goldstein, Pryor and Schlegel.(e) Clinical versus Subclinical Varicocele: Improvement in Fertility\n\n  after Varicocelectomy by Dhabuwala, Hamid and Moghissi.28 April 1997 - Operation42.    On 28 April 1997, Mr Harte checked into\n\nGleneagles Hospital for his operation as instructed by Dr Tan. The hospital counter staff\n\ngave him some forms to sign: admission form, consent form and conditions of\n\nservices/hospital policies form. Dr Tan performed the surgery under general anaesthesia.\n\nIt commenced at 0955 hrs and ended at 1115 hrs. After the surgery, Mr Harte was wheeled to\n\na recovery room in the day ward to rest.Dr Tan’s extremely brief operation notes stated the\n\n      following:Operation Performed:Bilateral Varicocelectomy (Redo left)Incision:Bilateral groinFindings:(Left) varicocelectomy done beforeProcedure:Few external veins (Left) side and small internal veins.Veins x 7 ligated.(Right) varicocelectomy.Veins x 11 taken.Huge external veins as wellClosure:Vicryl closure.43.    Against the advice of the hospital’s nurse,\n\nMs Tan Sang Eng, the plaintiff insisted on using the toilet despite the nurse having\n\nbrought a urinal and offered a bedpan. Mrs Harte told the nurse that ‘if he wants to\n\ngo to the toilet he must’. She said that she would accompany him. Mrs Harte and the\n\nnurse helped to seat Mr Harte on the toilet bowl. Mrs Harte remained in the toilet with\n\nhim.44.    Whilst seated on the toilet bowl, he fainted,\n\nfell off the toilet bowl and his head hit the floor first. This fall took place at 12.20\n\np.m., about an hour after the surgery. Mrs Harte who was present tried to prevent him from\n\nfalling but was unsuccessful because he was too heavy. These facts are not disputed.45.    The major issue here is whether Mr Harte had in\n\nthe process contused his scrotum and both testes, as he fell off the toilet bowl whilst in\n\nan unconscious state. Were his testes and scrotum trapped by the toilet seat resulting in\n\nadditional traction injury to the delicate structures of the veins and arteries within the\n\nspermatic cord?46.    Thus, I have to consider (a) whether he had slid\n\nand then toppled off the toilet bowl (i.e. a combination of sliding and toppling) and (b)\n\nwhether his upper torso could possibly rotate about his knees to lift his entire scrotum\n\nclear of the toilet seat in the course of the fall. This is a matter of considerable\n\nimportance when determining whether there was any contusion or traction injury (or both)\n\nresulting from Mr Harte’s fall from the toilet seat in an unconscious state. It is\n\nnot disputed that an unconscious man is not capable of activating his leg muscles to lift\n\nhimself clear from the toilet seat to avoid injury to his scrotum and testes. I will\n\nexamine these issues in much more detail later.47.    After the fall, Mrs Harte called the nurses to\n\nhelp lift him up and put him on the bed. The hospital’s nurse immediately telephoned\n\nto notify Dr Tan’s clinic of the fall. Dr Tan sent Dr Balaji Sadasivam, a\n\nneurosurgeon, to examine Mr Harte’s head. Dr Balaji did not examine the surgical\n\nincisions or the testicular area.48.    Mr Harte said that he felt pain at the bump on\n\nhis head but not in his testes or scrotum on that day. By about 5.00 p.m., the effects of\n\nthe anaesthesia had worn off.49.    Dr Balaji saw Mr Harte again during the evening\n\nand informed him that he could be discharged later in the evening unless there were\n\ncomplications. Since no complications occurred, he was certified fit for discharge. After\n\nsettling his bills, Mr Harte left the hospital at about 7.00 p.m. together with his wife.50.    At the time of discharge, he felt some minor\n\nswelling and discomfort at the scrotal area. He was able to walk slowly. Mr Harte assumed\n\nthat they were the normal effects of the surgery based on what Dr Tan had earlier told\n\nhim. At bedtime, there was some swelling at the scrotum area but it did not seem unusual\n\nto Mr Harte. Then he went to sleep.51.    According to Mr Harte, no one mentioned that Dr\n\nTan would be seeing him. However, Dr Tan alleged that he told the theatre nurses to inform\n\nMr Harte to wait for him. Ms Magdalene Taye, the assistant clinic nurse working for Dr Tan\n\nat that time, testified that she visited Mr Harte in the day ward and specifically\n\ninformed him to wait for Dr Tan to review him. There appears to be some corroborative\n\nevidence in the form of an entry at 1350 hours in the Nursing Care Plan for Mr Harte in\n\nGleneagles Hospital which states \"S/B Dr. Tan’s clinic nurse – Dr. Tan\n\nwill review pt in wd.\"52.    With the evidence I have, I think that Mr Harte\n\nwas not quite truthful in saying that he was not told that Dr Tan would be seeing him.\n\nHowever, I do not think that it was reasonable for Dr Tan to expect the patient to wait\n\nindefinitely for him. Mr Harte had waited from 12.20 p.m. (the time of the fall) to 7.00\n\np.m. Yet there was no sight of Dr Tan, who was too busy with his other operations.\n\nApparently he had lined up 7 operations for himself, one after another, and Mr\n\nHarte’s was his 2ndoperation for that day.53.    In any event, I do not think this is crucial\n\nbecause Dr Tan himself said that even if he had seen Mr Harte, he would not have done\n\nanything because there was no complaint of pain in the scrotum and the surgical sites did\n\nnot bleed. In my judgment, discharging Mr Harte was not substandard post-operative patient\n\ncare since there were no obvious or alarming signs at that time that his testicles were\n\ntraumatised.54.    Not being given the details of the fall, Dr Tan\n\nassumed that Mr Harte fell from the standing position and hit his head. Even if he had\n\nbeen told that he had fallen off from a toilet bowl whilst in an unconscious state, he\n\nwould not have envisaged a possible scrotal and testicular haematoma leading to atrophy.\n\nHe frankly admitted that the thought never even crossed his mind. I believe him. The\n\ncausation mechanism is not one which is immediately apparent without a meticulous analysis\n\non how a fall like that can possibly contuse the testicles or cause traction injury. In my\n\nopinion, it is not likely for a reasonably competent urologist in the shoes of Dr Tan to\n\nforesee that possibility at all at that time. Hence, even if Dr Tan discharged the patient\n\nafter seeing him, I would not consider him negligent. Dr Tan’s inability to attend to\n\nMr Harte before he left the hospital had not contributed to the damage caused.",
        "29 April 1997 – Swelling": "55.    On the following morning when Mr Harte woke up,\n\nhe found that both his testes had swollen considerably to almost 2 to 3 times their normal\n\nsize. I think that Mr Harte was describing the swelling of his scrotum as a whole and not\n\nthe swelling of his testesper sei.e. intratesticular swelling without\n\nextratesticular swelling. The swelling was much more than what he experienced after his\n\nfirst varicocelectomy by Dr Dubin. He felt excruciating throbbing pain around his\n\ntesticular area, which was not there the night before.56.    Mr Harte testified that he telephoned Dr\n\nTan’s office at about 9.00 a.m. in a desperate attempt to find out what was going on\n\nand whether he should go back to hospital immediately. One of Dr Tan’s nurses told\n\nhim that Dr Tan was busy. When he managed to speak with Dr Tan, he told him of the unusual\n\npain and swelling. Dr Tan assured him that no action was needed and the swelling would\n\nsubside. Dr Tan instructed him to take the pills prescribed and everything would return to\n\nnormal thereafter.57.    However Mr Harte in his complaint to the\n\nSingapore Medical Council stated that he consulted Dr Tantwo daysafter the\n\nsurgery, which suggested that he did not speak at all to Dr Tan on the day following the\n\nsurgery. This was clearly wrong as Dr Tan was not in Singapore on 30 April 1997.\n\nObviously, Mr Harte was mistaken. Apart from this discrepancy, the rest of his complaint\n\nwas generally consistent with the events described in his evidence-in-chief.58.    Dr Tan denied receiving a phone call from Mr\n\nHarte on the day following the surgery i.e. 29 April 1997. I prefer Mr Harte’s\n\ntestimony as it has a ring of truth to it. The swelling would have been considerable and\n\nunusual. A swelling of the size described would naturally cause considerable pain. Under\n\nthe circumstances, I cannot imagine Mr Harte sitting still with the swelling he had and\n\nnot seek immediate assurances from Dr Tan personally.59.    Dr Tan never asked Mr Harte to see him at his\n\nclinic. Believing Dr Tan’s assurances, Mr Harte remained at home, in great pain,\n\nhoping and expecting the pain and swelling to subside. Over the next few days, the\n\nswelling increased instead until his scrotum was 5 to 6 times its normal size. As the\n\nswelling increased, his pain increased correspondingly.",
        "30 April 1997 – Further phone calls": "60.    Mr Harte called Dr Tan’s clinic again on 30\n\nApril 1997 because the pain and swelling was even greater than the previous day. He did\n\nnot get to speak to Dr Tan but managed to speak to a nurse. He informed the nurse of the\n\npain and swelling and said something was wrong. She told him to take the pills and come in\n\non 2 May 1997. In sheer desperation, he had, in one of his telephone calls, asked the\n\nnurse whether he should apply ice to his scrotum. She told him not to.61.    According to Dr Tan, he was out of Singapore on a\n\nday trip to Kuala Lumpur on 30 April 1997. 1 May 1997 was a public holiday. Another\n\nurologist would normally cover him in his absence. Had Mr Harte called the nurse or the\n\nanswering service and asked for Dr Tan on 30 April 1997, the nurse would have referred Mr\n\nHarte to the covering urologist. The clinic has an answering service after office hours.\n\nDr Tan alleged that Mr Harte had not called the clinic on 30 April 1997. However, he\n\nfailed to call all the material witnesses (e.g. all his staff who handled telephone calls\n\nin his clinic) to support what he said.62.    I accept Mr Harte’s evidence that he called\n\nthe clinic on 29 April and managed to speak with Dr Tan, and that he made further calls to\n\nDr Tan’s clinic on 30 April because the swelling and pain had increased further.63.    In my opinion, Dr Tan or his nurses should have\n\nasked Mr Harte to come to the clinic immediately. An issue thus arises whether there was\n\nany post-operative negligence. I shall deal with this in more detail later.",
        "2 May 1997 – 1stconsultation after surgery": "64.    By the 2 May 1997, Mr Harte’s scrotum had\n\ngrown to the size of a mango, about 7 inches in length and 5 inches across. The swelling\n\nwas at its maximum on the 2 or 3 May 1997 before it began to subside slowly.65.    Due to the pain and swelling, it was agonising\n\nfor him to walk down the hallway to Dr Tan’s clinic even with the assistance of his\n\nwife.66.    When he saw Dr Tan, he testified that hecomplained\n\nofthe swelling and theintense pain. After a short examination, Dr Tan simply\n\nrepeated his earlier advice that he had no treatment other than some medication. Dr Tan\n\nexplained that he had ascrotal haematomaand he would prescribe something toease\n\nthe painand reduce the swelling. The swelling should subside in due course. If the\n\nswelling remained, he woulddrain the blood from his scrotum. (The significance of\n\nthis evidence in bold will only be apparent later.)67.    Dr Tan prescribedpainkillers, antibiotics\n\nand anti-inflammatory medication. He did not inform Mr and Mrs Harte that the haematoma\n\ncould lead to irreparable damage to or atrophy of his testes. No ultrasound scan was done\n\non the swollen scrotum.68.    The next appointment was set for 9 May 1997.\n\nHowever, Mr Harte was still worried about the intense swelling and the pain. He kept\n\ncalling Dr Tan’s clinic every day for advice. Despite his persistent calls, Dr Tan\n\ndid not see him.",
        "9 May 1997 – 2ndconsultation after surgery": "69.    On 9thMay 1997, Mr and Mrs Harte went\n\nto see Dr Tan. The swelling had by then begun to subside somewhat although his scrotum was\n\nquite hard or firm to the touch. He examined the plaintiff’s scrotum with the\n\nultrasound machine in his office.70.    Dr Tan said that it was not necessary to drain\n\nthe blood because the swelling had gone down. He prescribed more pills.71.    In his medical report dated 24 May 1997, Dr Tan\n\nstated that he had reviewed Mr Harte on 2 May 1997 and noted that he had a complication of\n\na ‘scrotal haematoma’. Mr Harte was prescribed Zinnat, Danzen, Voltaren and\n\nAntacids. When he was last reviewed on 9 May 1997, the haematoma had begun to subside.",
        "26 May 1997 – 3rdconsultation and events\n\nthereafter": "72.    By the next consultation on 26 May 1997, the\n\nswelling had completely subsided. Dr Tan put Mr Harte on a 3 months’ course of\n\nPovinorum, which is a drug containing a form of synthetic testosterone known as\n\nmesterolone. No explanation was given to the plaintiff why this drug was necessary. This\n\ndid not seem proper to me. At the trial, Dr Tan’s explanation was that the\n\nmesterolone was part of the usual therapy that he normally gives to varicocelectomy\n\npatients to improve their fertility after surgery.73.    The plaintiff called Dr Schlegel as an expert\n\nmedical witness. Dr Schelegel is the Director at the Center for Male Reproductive Medicine\n\n& Microsurgery at the Cornell Institute for Reproductive Medicine, The New York\n\nPresbyterian Hospital-Weill Medical College of Cornell University, New York. He is also\n\nthe Associate Professor of Urology and Vice-Chairman for Clinical Affairs, Department of\n\nUrology at the same establishment. Dr Schlegel testified that synthetic testosterones like\n\nmesterolone in fact inhibit sperm production. If what Dr Schlegel said is true, then Dr\n\nTan’s explanation does not appear credible to me. I am inclined to believe that Dr\n\nTan already knew that the plaintiff’s testes were damaged to the extent that he was\n\nnot producing sufficient testosterone himself and he had to prescribe the synthetic\n\ntestosterone. But he could not bring himself to inform Mr Harte.74.    On 29 August 1997, Dr Tan ordered a seminal\n\nanalysis at the plaintiff’s request. This analysis revealed a marked reduction in the\n\nquantity and quality of his sperm. The count was less than 1 million sperm per millilitre\n\ncompared with 29 million sperm per millilitre in April 1997, and 27.68 million in April\n\n1996. A second seminal analysis a week later on 5 September 1997 showed no more sperm\n\nproduction.75.    Mr Harte saw Dr Tan again on 11 and 18 September.\n\nOn both these occasions, he tried to explain that his sperm could be collected in\n\nlocations other than his semen and he purportedly looked for blockage although prior to\n\nthe surgery, there was no evidence of retrograde ejaculation or any blockage.76.    On 8 October 1997, Dr Tan noted some 5 months\n\nafter the operation that the ‘haematoma occurred 2 –3 days post operation,\n\ninitially very gradual.’ This was hardly a contemporaneous record of the clinical\n\nfindings. It was then that he began to consider the ‘?mechanism of the haematoma’,\n\nwhich was what he wrote in his clinical notes.77.    On 9 October 1997, Mrs Harte called Dr Tan to\n\nfind out the reasons for the disastrous seminal test results. Dr Tan explained that his\n\ntestes were not functioning properly. Much dried blood was in his scrotum. There was a\n\nsmall 3mm epididymal cyst on his left side. Blood flow in his testes was not increased.\n\nThere was no evidence of varicocele except for thrombosed varicoceles on the left side.78.    On 11 October 1997, Dr Tan broke the devastating\n\nnews that it was very unlikely that he would ever father his own child. Mr and Mrs Harte\n\nwere shocked and devastated.79.    On 17 October 1997, Mrs Harte queried Dr Tan\n\nagain. Dr Tan told her that he did not encounter any problems during the surgery. He had\n\nremoved as many as 18 veins in other patients without the swelling that Mr Harte had. In\n\nMr Harte’s case, he removed about one third to half of the veins in his scrotum and\n\nthose left were ‘small veins’ less than 2 mm in size.Dr Tan’s reply to the Singapore Medical Council80.    As Dr Tan’s contemporaneous clinical notes\n\nwere brief, I have included his reply to the Singapore Medical Council dated 23 October\n\n1998 where some of his observations were included. Dr Tan statedinter aliathat:On review on 2 .5. 97, he complained of a scrotal hematoma that had\n\n  developed2 -3 daysafter the operation. The hematoma wasnon-tender. He was\n\n  prescribed antibiotics prophylactically and Danzen to aid resolution of hematoma.He was reviewed again a week later on 9.5.97. The hematoma had subsided\n\n  but he complained that the left testicle was harder than the right.The next review was on 26.5.97. The swelling had subsided almost\n\n  completely but there was residual induration of the scrotal sac which was expected to take\n\n  a longer period to subside.…In my opinion the cause of his testicular hypofunction is difficult to\n\n  determine at this time as it was highly unlikely that the arterial supply could have been\n\n  cut off during the operation which was carefully done with magnification. Whether the fall\n\n  and the subsequent hematocele had an effect on the outcome is again difficult to\n\n  ascertain. However due care was taken to manage the hematocele conservatively as it was\n\n  not tender and was expected to subside spontaneously.Mr Harte’s condition81.    Due to the insufficient levels of testosterone in\n\nhis blood, he became lethargic, had no stamina, lost his muscle mass and his sexual\n\nlibido, and had difficulty in achieving an erection. He started to grow breasts and had\n\ntender nipples until he received testosterone replacement therapy.82.    After getting testosterone replacement, his\n\nlibido improved and he did not feel as lethargic. The tenderness in his nipples subsided.\n\nHowever, his sex life was not the same as before.83.    It is not disputed that Mr Harte’s right\n\ntestis shrank in volume to 6 cc from what was previously 25 cc in April 1996. The left\n\ntestis shrank to 8 cc from what was previously 15 cc. His testes had suffered irreparable\n\nand irreversible vascular damage. Having atrophied, they cannot now produce sperm or\n\ntestosterone.84.    He feels ashamed of his body, in particular his\n\ntestes, when he has to use changing rooms in clubs and gymnasiums. He is now flabby even\n\nwith daily exercise.85.    Worst of all, he can no longer father a child\n\nthrough natural means because of the azoospermia i.e. total absence of sperm in his semen.\n\nThis has devastated him and his wife emotionally and psychologically.86.    The testosterone replacement therapy of skin\n\npatches by Dr Walter Futterweit was ineffective due to the humid climate in Singapore. Dr\n\nJimmy Beng prescribed testosterone supplement tablets in May 1999, which Mr Harte took on\n\na daily basis instead. Testosterone replacement therapy would have to be continued for the\n\nrest of his life. The plaintiff alleged that the heavy dosage exposed him to increased\n\nrisk of liver and prostrate cancer. Dr Clarence Lei Chang Moh testified that the risk of\n\nprostrate cancer was not increased though he agreed that some kinds of testosterone might\n\nstimulate the growth of small tumours in the liver.87.    On 11 September 1997, Mr Harte went for another\n\nCDUS scan of his testes. Dr Koay reported the following:EXAMS: ULTRASOUND TESTESCOLOUR DOPPLER ULTRASOUND OF TESTESBoth testes are of small volume with a patchy parenchymal echo pattern.\n\n  There are at least two calcific foci in the left testis. Both heads of epididymis appear\n\n  normal. There is a small 3 mm epididymal cyst on the left side. Tissue perfusion is not\n\n  increased. No evidence of demonstrable varicocele is shown on valsalva manoeuvre.\n\n  Thrombosed varicoceles are noted on the left side.COMMENTPatchy parenchymal echo pattern noted in both testes. There are a few calcific foci in\n\n  the left testis. There is a small epididymal cyst on the left side. Thrombosed varicoceles\n\n  are noted on the left side. Tissue perfusion is not increased.88.    Dr Koay explained that a normal testis is fairly\n\nhomogeneous. Since he saw a patchy echo pattern, it might be due to inflammation,\n\nischaemia or infarction. The patchiness showed that the tissue was not uniform and could\n\nindicate necrosis. The ‘calcific foci’ in the left testis indicated the presence\n\nof coagulated blood in the testes, an old haematoma, previous infection or infarcted\n\ntesticular tissue. ‘Tissue perfusion’ meant that there was still some blood flow\n\nthrough the arteries through the spermatic cord to the testes and implied that not all the\n\narterial blood supply had been cut. From his subjective assessment of the CDUS scan, the\n\nblood flow rate was either reduced or it could be normal. Hence, he wrote in his report\n\nthat the tissue perfusion was not increased.89.    In October 1998, Mr Harte consulted Dr Dubin\n\nagain for bilateral testicular biopsies. The pathology report showed that there was ‘partial\n\ngerminal tubules sclerosis and hyalinization’ and ‘focal preserved\n\ngerminal tubules showing decreased spermatogenesis with only few spermatids (less than 5\n\nper germinal tubule)’ for the left testicle biopsy, and ‘complete\n\ngerminal tubules and interstitial sclerosis and hyalinization’and ‘no\n\nspermatogenesis identified in this specimen’from the right testicle biopsy.\n\nEssentially this suggested that Mr Harte’s left testis could not produce any mature\n\nsperms but just some spermatids (i.e. immature sperms) whereas his right testis was in a\n\nworse condition because no live sperm or spermatid was found.90.    Dr Schlegel advised that he might be able to\n\nextract sperm from his left testis and attempt the ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection)\n\nprocedure to fertilise one of Mrs Harte’s eggs. Several tries might be necessary. Dr\n\nSchlegel was hopeful of achieving a pregnancy.91.    Hence Mr and Mrs Harte had no other alternative\n\nbut to return to New York for the ICSI treatment by Dr Schlegel, which Mr Harte alleged\n\nwas the only way for them to receive the treatment they needed on a frequent, closely\n\nmonitored basis. Treatment ‘long-distance’ was not possible and was not ideal.\n\nFurther, leaving Singapore allowed them to reduce to some degree, the emotional trauma and\n\nhaunting memories of what had happened. Driven by their desire to achieve a pregnancy, Mr\n\nHarte decided to give up his position in Singapore thereby forgoing his expatriate\n\npackage, perks and bonuses, and all prospects of promotion.Broad Issues92.    Mr Harte alleged that Dr Tan had recommended an\n\nunnecessary surgery and further, that he negligently performed the operation producing the\n\ndisastrous results that such operations were not known to produce. Dr Tan however blamed\n\nthe atrophy on Mr Harte’s fall in the toilet of the hospital soon after the surgery,\n\nwhich he said had caused both contusion and traction injuries. The hospital denied that\n\nthey were liable at all as Dr Tan was not an employee of the hospital but a private and\n\nindependent doctor from whom Mr Harte had sought treatment.93.    The main issues as characterised by the plaintiff\n\nmay thus be summarised under 3 categories:",
        "(a) Pre-operative": "(1) Whether the 1stdefendant acted in accordance with the\n\nminimum standard of care and skill expected of him in:(a) Diagnosing that the plaintiff had bilateral varicocele as at April\n\n  1997;(b) Concluding that his bilateral varicocele was the cause of his\n\n  sub-fertility in April 1997;(c) Advising the plaintiff to undergo a bilateral varicocelectomy in\n\n  April 1997;(d) Advising the plaintiff that a bilateral varicocelectomy was the\n\n  only means available to address his subfertility in April 1997; and/or(e) Not specifically advising the plaintiff of the particular risks and\n\n  consequences of a bilateral varicocelectomy and/or one involving a repeat left\n\n  varicocelectomy.For the reasons given earlier, I find that Dr Tan had not acted below\n\nthe minimum standard of care and skill expected of him as a urologist in his pre-operative\n\ntreatment, care and management of Mr Harte. The issues pertaining to the surgery and\n\npost-operative care are listed below:",
        "(b) Surgery": "(2) Whether the 1stdefendant acted with the minimum\n\nstandard of care and skill expected of him during his surgery;(3) Whether the surgery caused the testicular atrophy;(4) Whether the 1stdefendant was the agent or servant of\n\nthe hospital at the time of the surgery;(5) Whether the hospital was vicariously liable for the acts and\n\nomissions of the 1stdefendant; and(6) Whether the defendants committed battery and trespass to the\n\nplaintiff.(c) Post-operative(5) Whether the fall from the toilet caused the testicular atrophy;(6) Whether the 1stdefendant acted in accordance with the\n\nminimum standard of care and skill expected of him in:(a) seeing the plaintiff only on the 4thday after the\n\n  operation despite the persistent complaints of pain and swelling; and(b) not taking steps to drain the blood or operate to reduce the\n\n  swelling at the time of examination.Anatomy of the male reproductive system94.    Before I deal with the evidence, it is useful to\n\nhave an understanding of the male reproductive system. I find the following medical\n\nliterature to be most helpful:(a) Exhibit P 18 -- Atlas of Surgical Management of Male Infertility\n\n  edited by Thomas and Nagler. Chapter 2: Normal surgical anatomy contributed by Frank\n\n  Hinman.(b) Exhibit P 20 -- Color Atlas of Urologic Surgery by Cockett and\n\n  Koshiba at page 306: The Scrotum and Its Contents.(c) Exhibit P 46 -- Extracts from Gray’s Anatomy by Williams,\n\n  Warwick, Dyson and Bannister(d) Exhibit P 6 -- A colour diagram of ‘The Male Reproductive\n\n  System’95.    It is appropriate that I give a brief description\n\nof the structure of the scrotum. The scrotum is divided by a septum into two compartments,\n\neach containing one testis. The skin of the scrotum is thin and elastic, and richly\n\nvascularized. Beneath the skin is the dartos muscle and connective tissue that contracts\n\nwith the cold and relaxes with heat. Another layer of loose connective tissue lies between\n\nthe dartos layer and the deeper layers. This connective tissue is loose and permits the\n\nscrotal contents to move freely. It also allows blood and other fluid and haematomas to\n\naccumulate and spread. The blood supply of the scrotal wall comes from the external and\n\ninternal pudendal arteries. The scrotal wall is also supplied by a rich network of\n\nlymphatics.96.    There are 3 complete layers that envelop and\n\nprotect the testis, epididymis and the spermatic cord: external spermatic fascia,\n\ncremasteric fascia and muscle layer, and the deepest is the internal spermatic fascia.97.    The testis is encased within a tough fibrous\n\nmembrane called the tunica albuginea. It is loosely suspended by the spermatic cord and\n\nits investing tunic layers. The gubernaculum attaches the testis to the base of the\n\nscrotum. The epididymis is a long narrow body sitting at the posterior border of the\n\ntestis with its enlarged head near the upper pole of the testis. The tail of the\n\nepididymis is attached to the testis at its lower end. This tail connects to the vas\n\ndeferens, which is a tube for the passage of sperm.98.    The testis produces sperm within the seminiferous\n\ntubules and secretes androgen from the Legdig cells. The epididymis collects the immature\n\nsperms from the testes and allows them to mature.99.    The spermatic cord is a long, round bundle that\n\nbegins at the internal inguinal ring and exits at the external inguinal ring near the\n\ngroin region, and finally ends at the upper pole of the testis. Within it are the vas\n\ndeferens, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerve fibres to the cord and testis.100.    There are two main arteries in the spermatic\n\ncord: internal spermatic artery (also known as the testicular artery) and the artery to\n\nthe vas deferens. Both supply blood to the testis and epididymis. They are connected\n\ntogether at their distal ends. Therefore, damage to any one of these two arteries will not\n\ncompromise the testis. Additionally, the cremasteric artery (also known as the external\n\nspermatic artery) supplies blood to the coverings of the spermatic cord. D13 is a good\n\ndiagram showing the free anastomosis between the three arteries supplying blood to the\n\ntestis.101.    The veins of the testis and epididymis form the\n\npampiniform plexus, part of which surrounds the spermatic artery (internal spermatic\n\nveins) and the other surrounds the vas deferens (vasal veins). As these veins ascend up\n\nthe spermatic cord, they merge and decrease in number but increase in size. Finally, they\n\nconverge into the spermatic vein at the internal inguinal ring. Arteries supply blood to\n\nthe scrotum and testes, and the veins drain the blood away. The testis is also drained by\n\nthe cremateric veins, external veins and the gubernacular veins as illustrated by Dr Tan\n\nin exhibit D28.102.    With this brief summary out of the way, I shall\n\nrevert to the case at hand.Plaintiff’s case103.    The plaintiff relied heavily on the doctrine ofres\n\nipsa loquiturto establish his case because the surgery was entirely under the\n\nmanagement and control of the 1stdefendant, and vicariously, the 2nddefendants. It is not disputed that bilateral testicular atrophy is not likely to occur\n\nfollowing a bilateral varicocelectomy unless the surgeon has not performed the surgery\n\nwith sufficient care or is simply incompetent. According to Dr Notley, bilateral\n\ntesticular infarction is not an acceptable complication of this surgical procedure. All\n\nthe 1stdefendant’s medical experts generally agreed that it is\n\nexceedingly rare to have testicular atrophy and azoospermia as a result of such an\n\noperation.104.    The various possibilities put forward on what\n\nmight have gone wrong during the operation to cause such a disastrous outcome were:a) Inadvertent injury to or ligation of a testicular artery which is\n\n  known to result in testicular atrophy or impaired spermatogenesis, or both;b) Compression of the venous structures within the spermatic cord;c) Venous hypertension from the division of an excessive number of\n\n  veins.105.    Initially, the main thrust of the\n\nplaintiff’s case was the division of an excessive number of veins by Dr Tan. In\n\nsupport of this, counsel for the plaintiff referred me to the following passage from\n\nClinical Negligence by Powers and Harris 3rdEdition at p 1389 para 41.100:When the complaints are infertility and the testes are lost because of\n\n  ischaemic necrosis after open correction of the varicoceles, patients are particularly\n\n  aggrieved and likely to resort to litigation. Testicular death may follow venous\n\n  congestion leading to increased testicular pressure which, in turn, results in arterial\n\n  impairment leading to ischaemic necrosis. When the presenting complaints are of mild\n\n  discomfort only and testicles are lost, patients are likely to resort to litigation.106.    However, this line was not pushed very hard\n\nduring closing submissions by counsel for the plaintiff after Dr Schlegel himself\n\ncategorically said that one could divide all the veins leaving the vasal vein intact both\n\nfor a man with or without varicoceles, and no atrophy would result because there would\n\nstill be sufficient venous drainage with the vasal vein intact.107.    Counsel for the plaintiff postulated that:(a) Dr Tan could have damaged the vas and its vessels when he clamped\n\n  his Babcock forceps around the vas and spermatic cord, which would be larger in the case\n\n  of an obese man like the plaintiff;(b) He could have caused traction injury to the spermatic cord when he\n\n  tried to deliver it out through the layers of muscle and subcutaneous fat, and through the\n\n  skin incision so that he could perform the surgery on the veins in and around the\n\n  spermatic cord. The likelihood of such injury increased when the incision through the\n\n  layers of muscle and fat was oblique or diagonally made to reach the spermatic cord i.e.\n\n  the ‘undermining technique’, which is a more difficult surgical procedure;(c) Due to the insufficient spermatic cord length available at the\n\n  subinguinal region, it was doubtful that Dr Tan could have pulled out the spermatic cord\n\n  through the skin incision without causing traction injury to the delicate structures;(d) Dr Tan could have inadvertently ligated or divided the testicular\n\n  artery (or even other arteries as well) because of inadequate optical magnification of 3 x\n\n  power optical loupes when the medical literature recommended the use of 6 x power, thereby\n\n  causing loss of or reduced blood supply. Similarly, inadvertent over-ligation of veins due\n\n  to inadequate optical magnification increased the risk of venous congestion. [Whilst on\n\n  this point, I note that Goldstein, Gilbert, Dicker, Dwosh and Gnecco in their paper,Microsurgical\n\n  Inguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing\n\n  Techniquespublished in December 1992, referred to the use of2.5x\n\n  magnification loupes for varicocelectomies. By this standard, I do not think that Dr Tan\n\n  had used insufficient magnification for his surgery.]108.    It was thus submitted that Dr Tan blundered in a\n\nsimilar fashion on both the left and right side of the varicocelectomy operation because:(a) the undermining would have led him to operate on the spermatic cord\n\n  fairly closely to the left and right testes owing to the insufficient spermatic cord\n\n  length, which meant that his was not a subinguinal approach but a scrotal approach, which\n\n  carried with it a high risk of testicular atrophy;(b) the veins at that lower level of the spermatic cord near the testes\n\n  would be more numerous and finer in the form of the pampiniform plexus; and(c) the scrotal varicocelectomies involving vein ligation in that\n\n  region of the pampiniform plexus were no longer carried out, as such scrotal approaches\n\n  were associated with the ligation of too many veins leading to ischaemic necrosis due to\n\n  venous impairment.Nurses’ evidence109.    Nurse Tan Sang Eng examined Mr Harte immediately\n\nafter the fall. He did not complain of any pain in the scrotum or penis area. She took a\n\nglance at the plaintiff’s scrotal area when she removed the blanket covering Mr Harte\n\nto examine the skin incision sites (which were not at the scrotum but much higher up at\n\nthe groin area: see photographs P25 to P 28). She did not see any swelling, bruising or\n\ndiscolouration. She maintained that she was sufficiently experienced to tell if the\n\nplaintiff’s scrotum or penis was bruised or discoloured.110.    Nurse Looi Chai Hong examined the plaintiff at\n\nabout 2.00 p.m. She also saw no bruising, swelling or discolouration at the scrotal area,\n\nbut she did notice a slight bruise,slight bluish in colour, on the left side of\n\nthe plaintiff’s head. Her examination was about 1 hours after the fall. However by\n\n7 p.m., Mr Harte could feel the swelling and discomfort because his scrotum touched his\n\npants.111.    Dr Notley believed that swelling should begin\n\nabout 2 hours after the fall. Consequently, the nurses might not notice any swelling at\n\nhis scrotum. The nurses would probably also not see any difference or notice any\n\ncolouration at that stage. Dr Notley’s evidence demonstrates that the absence of\n\nswelling, bruising or discolouration at this time is not conclusive.112.    Dr Notley also said that a change of colour of\n\nthe scrotum within 2 hours would be expected for a severe injury causing a severe\n\nhaematoma. The obvious corollary is that a blunt trauma of a less serious nature may not\n\ninvolve a change of colour. This is not exceptional where there is minimal or no rupture\n\nof the blood vessels in the scrotal area external to the testes.113.    It is my opinion therefore that the nurses would\n\nprobably have noticed the bruising and discolouration if it was a very serious blunt\n\ntrauma that not only damaged the testes internally, but also severely ruptured the blood\n\nvessels in the extratesticular area of the scrotum. Where the blunt trauma was not as\n\nsevere, the testes might still suffer contusion but there might not be a violent rupture\n\n(as opposed to a minimal rupture or rupture at the microlevel) of the extratesticular\n\nblood supply to lead to an obvious scrotal haematoma. Nonetheless, the intratesticular\n\ncontusion itself might still be serious enough to lead to atrophy. Thus the absence of\n\ndiscolouration and scrotal swelling observed by the nurses was inconclusive. In other\n\nwords, one could not rule out internal testicular traction or contusion injury (or both)\n\nas a possible cause of the atrophy simply because those symptoms were absent.",
        "Plaintiff’s evidence": "114.    The plaintiff did not vomit or feel nausea after\n\nthe fall. He only experienced ‘minor swelling and discomfort’ but no pain in his\n\nscrotum by the time of his discharge. The pain was only felt the following morning, when\n\nhe woke up.115.    A/Prof Foo Keong Tatt said that if the pain was\n\nvery severe, there would be severe nausea and the patient would vomit. Dr Schlegel also\n\nsaid that in cases of blunt trauma to the testicle causing damage, there would be a sudden\n\nand dramatic increase in pain accompanied normally by nausea and vomiting at that time\n\nbecause of its severity. From this evidence, it appears that severe pain is likely to\n\ncause vomiting and nausea. Since Mr Harte did not feel any intense pain, it is not\n\ninconsistent that he felt no nausea and did not vomit. But not all blunt traumas cause\n\nsevere pain. Thus, the absence of severe pain, vomiting and nausea after the fall is again\n\ninconclusive.116.    Based on table 3 in the paper ‘Blunt\n\nScrotal Trauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management’ by Munter and\n\nFaleski, it was submitted that there should be symptoms of vomiting and nausea whenever\n\nthere was testicular or scrotal contusion. The article itself referred to a case report of\n\na 9- year-old boy who sustained a blunt straddle type injury about 24 hours before. He was\n\nbrought for evaluation after persistent swelling, discolouration and right testicular\n\npain. Despite this, there wasno nausea, vomiting or fever. He had been comfortable\n\nin bed but had significant pain when walking which was in an exaggerated straddle type of\n\ngait. Here, an ultrasound showed that the left testicle was normal but the right testicle\n\nwas moderately enlarged with intact tunica albuginia and epididymis. Within 36 hours, the\n\npain and swelling resolved and the patient did not suffer atrophy. This example clearly\n\ndrives home the point that not all trauma injuries must be accompanied by symptoms of\n\nnausea, vomiting or fever. It is overly simplistic to conclude that the plaintiff could\n\nnot possibly have suffered any testicular or scrotal contusion because these symptoms were\n\nnot manifested. As with all symptoms, I must emphasize that their absence or presence is\n\nnot conclusive but may only be indicative of a particular medical condition.117.    The aforesaid table 3 shows that the risk of\n\nsignificant morbidity if misdiagnosed in the case of testicular or scrotal contusion is\n\nnot high compared with torsion injury and testicular rupture or epididymal rupture. I\n\nunderstand the argument to be that testicular or scrotal contusion is thus not likely to\n\nresult in any testicular atrophy. In my opinion, table 3 compares the risk of morbidity\n\nfor contusion injury with the far more serious cases of (a) torsion at the spermatic cord\n\nlevel which can choke off all the blood supply to the testis; and (b) rupture of the\n\ntestis or epididymis. It is going too far to infer from table 3 that morbidity in\n\ncontusion injury isper seunlikely.",
        "Mrs Harte’s evidence": "118.    According to Mrs Harte, the plaintiff was ‘alarmed\n\nat the swelling in his scrotum’on the morning after the surgery. It was more\n\nthan the swelling after the first varicocelectomy operation by Dr Dubin. The\n\nplaintiff’s scrotum was ‘brightred initially when he woke up.\n\nOver the next few days it turnedreddish purplish’. She never said\n\nhis scrotum appeared blue-black, blackish or dark in colour. But clearly, she did notice a\n\nchange of colour to a deeper or darker colour.119.    Reddish purplish is actually a mixture of red\n\nand blue, giving the purple hues. Colour perception is very subjective and it depends also\n\non the kind of light under which she observed Mr Harte’s swollen scrotum. In my mind,\n\nsome reddish inflammation coupled with a blue-black bruising might well manifest in a\n\ncolour combination, which appears darkish reddish purplish in colour. It is not possible\n\nto rule out scrotal haemorrhage being mixed with the inflammation. When the inflammation\n\nresolves itself faster than the blue-black bruising, then a tinge of blue could well\n\nremain after several days. Thus it is not that simple and straightforward to determine or\n\ninfer reliably from the colour changes the actual cause of the extratesticular swelling,\n\nwhether it is exclusively the result of haemorrhage due to contusion or traction, or\n\ninflammationper se, or a combination of both inflammation and haemorrhage.",
        "Dr Tan Eng Choon’s and Dr Jimmy Beng’s evidence": "120.    Counsel for the plaintiff referred me to the\n\nfollowing testimony of Dr Tan Eng Choon, who treated Mr Harte in October 1997:A: From the history of the surgery and history of swelling after the\n\n  operation, I suspect that a vascular event had probably taken place, which resulted in the\n\n  atrophy of the testes. A vascular event means that his blood supply to the testes has been\n\n  compromised meaning reduced, or the swelling could be compressing on the vital structures,\n\n  which is the testes; and that resulted in the reduced blood flow, which caused the testes\n\n  to undergo atrophy.Q: Did you thinkat that timethat the atrophy would have been\n\n  related to the surgery?A: I suspected very strongly.121.    However, when Dr Tan Eng Choon was asked if he\n\nhad been told during the consultation that Mr Harte fell in the toilet soon after the\n\noperation, Dr Tan said he had no such information based on his record.122.    Dr Jimmy Beng who examined the plaintiff in May\n\n1999 (some 19 months after Dr Tan Eng Choon) similarly took the position that ‘in\n\nview of the history given that there was a severe swelling after the surgery… some\n\ndamage had occurred to the testes, most likely of a vascular cause’.He referred\n\nto the biopsy performed on Mr Harte’s atrophic testes on 21 October 1998 and the\n\npathology report, which mentioned ‘germinal tubules sclerosis and hyalinization’.\n\nDr Jimmy Beng explained that ‘sclerosis’ meant scarring and\n\n‘hyalinization’ was a change in the protein structure of the cells. These\n\nchanges were not consistent with an infection and could be observed when an organ such as\n\nthe testes was deprived of blood supply.123.    I remind myself of the various objections which\n\nI shall not go into, one of which was that both Dr Jimmy Beng and Dr Tan Eng Choon\n\nsubpoenaed by the plaintiff were not willing to be expert witnesses. Hence, I limited\n\ntheir evidence to the medical findings reached by them at that time as part of their\n\ntreatment of Mr Harte. They were merely witnesses of fact and no more.124.    It appears that the fall was not made known to\n\nDr Tan Eng Choon and Dr Jimmy Beng. Not having the full history, it is not surprising that\n\nDr Tan Eng Chuan readily suspected that the surgery was the sole cause of the atrophy\n\nsince that was the only known event occurring earlier. But where there are two or more\n\nknown events, then each must be separately evaluated to see if each can cause the same\n\nresult. If some or all of them are capable of causing the same result, then one must\n\nthoroughly evaluate the causative factors in each ‘capable event’ and balance\n\nall the probabilities before coming to any conclusion as to which ‘capable\n\nevent’, or even which combination of the several ‘capable events’ is the\n\nlikely cause of all the vascular damage. This exercise of fact-finding is hardly an easy\n\ntask where there is more than one ‘capable event’.125.    Since Dr Jimmy Beng and Dr Tan Eng Choon did not\n\nhave the benefit of performing this diagnostic exercise (unlike the medical expert\n\nwitnesses called by the plaintiff and 1stdefendant who were required to do\n\nthis evaluation), their evidence would not have as much probative value in relation to the\n\ncorrect inference to be drawn for the proximate and probable cause of the vascular damage,\n\nalthough I do accept (a) their medical finding that vascular damage had indeed occurred,\n\nand (b) Dr Jimmy Beng’s explanation for the presence of ‘hyalinization’\n\nwhich he said could be seen when an organ was deprived of blood supply.126.    In my opinion, a contusion injury to the testes\n\ndue to a fall may cause internal haemorrhage within the tissues of the testes. The\n\nresulting testicular haematoma and buildup of pressure inside the testes can also shut\n\ndown the blood supply leading to ‘hyalinization’. Thus the presence of\n\n‘hyalinization’per sedoes not indicate that it must necessarily be due\n\nto the devascularisation flowing from some negligent surgical operation. Thus both events\n\nare equally capable of producing the same end result of ‘hyalinization’. One\n\ncannot so readily infer from the presence of ‘hyalinization’ that the cause\n\ncannot be due to a physical injury from a fall.127.    That there is ‘sclerosis’ and\n\n‘hyalinisation’ as found in the pathology report is not disputed. In fact, that\n\nthe damage is vascular in nature is also not in dispute at all. The dispute is solely\n\nwhether the deprivation of blood supply and the resultant vascular damage is more likely\n\nto be caused by the surgery or by the fall. I observe that no party has adopted any\n\nintermediate position that both events might well have contributed to the vascular damage,\n\nwith one being the dominant cause and the other, the secondary cause. As such, I shall not\n\naddress this point since the parties themselves have not regarded that as a reasonable\n\npossibility. All three parties pursued the ‘all or nothing approach’ i.e. either\n\nthe surgery or the fall was the cause but not both.",
        "Dr Schlegel’s and Dr Notley’s evidence": "128.    Dr Schlegel and Dr Notley testified that\n\nsubstandard surgery was the cause of the vascular damage. Dr Notley’s belief was that\n\nthe testicles were infarcted because Dr Tan operated on Mr Harte who no longer had\n\nvaricoceles. The previous varicocelectomy had removed the varicocele on the left and there\n\nwas no varicocele on his right. After the operation by Dr Tan, Mr Harte therefore ended up\n\nwith an inadequate venous drainage, a serious venous congestion leading to reduced blood\n\nflow, a lowered oxygen saturation within the testicles and the deadly sequence of\n\ninfarction.129.    Dr Notley considered Dr Koay’s ultrasound\n\nreport to be ambiguous. He believed that ultrasound was not a reliable tool of\n\ninvestigation. It would have to be backed up by the presence of a clinical varicocele.130.    In Dr Notley’s opinion, a doctor should not\n\noperate on an assumption. If an assumption was made that a patient had a varicocele, which\n\ncould not be demonstrated clinically or unequivocally on ultrasound, the number of veins\n\ntaken should be limited very severely. Dr Notley’s inclination was that no operation\n\nshould be performed unless the doctor was completely certain. If he was not, then it was\n\nsubstandard management. In his view, Dr Tan had operated improperly on an assumption that\n\nMr Harte had varicocele. His ligation of the veins subinguinally to deal with his\n\ninfertility by further varicocele operations was therefore substandard. The fact that Mr\n\nHarte ended up with bilateral infarction flowed from Dr Tan’s substandard management.131.    Dr Koay himself testified that there was in fact\n\nevidence of varicocele on the left side and mild varicocele on the right side. He\n\nmentioned ‘intermittent’ varicocele on the left side to mean ‘mild to\n\nmoderate’ varicocele. ‘Intermittent’ meant that the varicocele appeared\n\nunder stress. Without stress, it was not seen.132.    Dr Tan read Dr Koay’s radiologist report\n\nand considered the description used by Dr Koay of ‘intermittent’ varicocele to\n\nmean the presence of varicocele. I accept that Dr Tan had not misinterpreted Dr\n\nKoay’s report. To understand ‘intermittence’ in the context of a\n\nvaricocele, an example may be appropriate. Clearly, there is no such thing as\n\n‘intermittent cancer’. Just as with cancer, a varicocele represents a medical\n\ncondition. It is not as if the varicocele medical condition is an intermittent one. The\n\n‘intermittence’ is actually a manifestation of a varicocele vein because the\n\nreflux of blood is seen as intermittent in the sense that the blood refluxes when pressure\n\nis applied. That description may have been confusing to Dr Notley, but not to Dr Koay and\n\nDr Tan.133.    Further, Dr Tan testified that he found\n\nvaricocele veins when he operated on Mr Harte. In that regard, Dr Koay’s and Dr\n\nTan’s diagnosis based on the CDUS had been surgically confirmed to be correct.134.    In the circumstances, I have to reject Dr\n\nNotley’s opinion that Dr Tan had operated merely on an assumption that Mr Harte had\n\nvaricocele and therefore he had been substandard in his management.135.    Dr Notley made a clear distinction between\n\noperating on a patient with varicocele and on one without. For a patient with varicocele,\n\nit was unlikely that he would suffer from testicular infarction when the vas was isolated\n\nand not ligated. However if that was done for a normal person, there would be a much\n\ngreater risk of infarction because a normal person would not have those extra veins, which\n\na person suffering from varicocele would have. When counsel for the plaintiff referred Dr\n\nNotley to the medical literature showing that leaving one set of vasal veins was\n\nsufficient, Dr Notley explained that every one of those articles assumed that the\n\noperation was on a man with a clinically evident varicocele and therefore, leaving a set\n\nof vasal veins was sufficient for drainage.136.    However, Dr Schlegel contradicted Dr\n\nNotley’s evidence. In his testimony, Dr Schlegel emphatically said that the vasal\n\nvein alone would be enough to drain the testes to avoid infarction. The rest of the\n\ninternal veins and external veins could be tied up. This was truebothfor a\n\nman suffering from varicocele and one who was not. From his experience at Cornell where\n\nthousands of such operations had been performed based on such a procedure using the vasal\n\nveins as the only source of drainage, there had never been a case of testicular atrophy.\n\nTherefore, if Dr Tan had left one set of vasal veins behind for venous drainage as he said\n\nhe had, his surgery would not have caused atrophy, regardless whether Mr Harte had\n\nvaricocele, minimal varicocele or no varicocele. In my opinion, Dr Schlegel’s\n\nevidence here is very damaging to the plaintiff’s case.137.    In Dr Schlegel’s view, inadvertent injury\n\nduring surgery to the arteries supplying blood to the testicles could lead to\n\ndevascularisation. As a matter of causation, this could not be disputed. Dr Tan agreed\n\nthat if the internal wall of the artery was damaged (i.e. endothelial injury) then:a)    platelets in the blood adhere to the injured sites\n\n  on the endothelium (inner wall of the arteries) and clots would form;b)    thrombosis might result; andc)    this could lead to ischaemic injury to the\n\n  testicle, resulting eventually in testicular atrophy.138.    Dr Tan maintained however that he did not injure\n\nany artery during the surgery. He had carefully lifted up the spermatic cord during the\n\nsurgery by using a Babcock forceps to grip and lift the cord. He then slipped his finger\n\nunder the cord to bring it up. I doubt that the arteries in the spermatic cord had\n\nsustained any endothelial damage from such handling by Dr Tan.139.    Since there are three arteries supplying blood\n\nto each testis, one needs to inadvertently damage more than one artery on each side before\n\ndevascularisation can happen. Having evaluated this, I think it is unlikely for Dr Tan to\n\nmake so many consecutive errors. In any event, if it is a shutdown of blood supply due to\n\ntotal arterial blockage, one should not see swelling. Since there was intratesticular\n\nswelling, I have to rule out this mode of causation.140.    Dr Notley then attributed the colour changes on\n\nthe plaintiff’s scrotum to infarction after surgery. He explained that the scrotum\n\nand testicles have a rich blood supply. The very dense subcutaneous plexus of vessels in\n\nthe scrotum act as a radiator so that large amounts of heat can be lost. A scrotal\n\nhaematoma is caused by rupture of one or more of the vessels in the scrotum and that\n\nresults in bleeding into the tissues of the scrotum. Within the first hour, there is not\n\nmuch colour change. As the bleedings come to the surface, the scrotum looks a bit blue.\n\nGradually, it becomes more and more dense. The scrotum will rapidly become black within\n\ntwo or three hours after the injury. By twelve hours, the scrotum is usually black and\n\nswollen for aseverehaematoma. The haematoma is contained within the fascia\n\nplanes but may spread to the penis, which is shared. The blackening will probably reach a\n\npeak in about 12 to 24 hours, stay black for two or three days, and then it will fade\n\ngradually, going yellowish, greenish and through ‘all the colours of the\n\nrainbow’.141.    The colour change is due to the deoxygenation\n\nand the haemoglobin in the blood cells left within the scrotum. This haemoglobin is broken\n\ndown by the local activity of the inflamed cells in the scrotum that changes the pigment\n\ninto the bile pigments, which are yellow and green. Hence, a black haematoma gradually\n\ngoes through this varying change of colour through yellow and green. It takes about 10 to\n\n12 days to subside. Dr Notley said that anti-inflammatory drugs would not make any\n\ndifference to that natural process.142.    Dr Notley expected Mr Harte to have an obvious\n\nscrotal haematoma by the time he left the hospital if the fall had caused it. A scrotal\n\nhaematoma usually takes several hours for the colouration to appear.It depends on the\n\nseverity of the injury, the nature of the injury, the size of the scrotum initially and a\n\nmultiplicity of factors. It varies from individual to individual.143.    I agree entirely with Dr Notley’s opinion,\n\nwhich I have highlighted in bold. I observe that Dr Notley’s evidence of a black\n\nscrotum was made in the context of an extremely severe haematoma or a very serious injury.\n\nI certainly do not think that remains invariably true of a less severe injury.144.    By way of contrast, the physical manifestations\n\nof an infarction according to Dr Notley are as follows::If a patient has an isolated testicular infarction, there will be\n\n  initially no discolouration of the scrotum at all. … After about eight to ten to\n\n  twelve hours, the reactionary swelling in the scrotum around the infracted testicle ...\n\n  will become red and it will look as if it was inflamed. And it will do that because of the\n\n  reaction of the scrotum to the infarcted testicle within it. It is the standard reaction\n\n  of the body to anything that happens to it which is the classical changes of the\n\n  inflammatory reaction which are redness, swelling, pain and tenderness, heat.\n\n  …….. So for testicular infarction, after about three or four days, the patient\n\n  will have a large firm scrotum which is this curious plumish colour discoloration, rather\n\n  light plum colour, rather the colour of the chair, the leather in the chair in which you\n\n  are sitting in, and it will gradually fade subsequently after that but it will not go\n\n  black. ..… I believe that the appearances of a testicular haematoma are so dramatic,\n\n  they really are very dramatic, it’s black ..If it’s an injury, it will be black, … I think within a few\n\n  hours, 6 at the most. … I personally put it blackish blue.…. If we took Mr Harte’s case, I would have expected him to\n\n  have an obvious scrotal haematoma by the time he left hospital……. To start with,\n\n  it would look a bit blue as the bleedings came to the surface and gradually, it would\n\n  become more and more dense.… I’m absolutely confident that 12 hours after sufficient\n\n  injury to produce a haematoma ..the scrotum will be black.145.    Dr Notley opined that testicular infarction not\n\nassociated with any physical trauma would cause the scrotum to be bright red. Gradually\n\nthe colour would become more dense: reddish brownish. That colour stays for about 4 to 5\n\ndays. Gradually, as the swelling subsides, the inflammatory reaction in the scrotum also\n\ndiminishes. But the scrotum will not turn black, unlike a scrotal haematoma.146.    During cross-examination by counsel for the 1stdefendant, Dr Notley explained that infection would make the situation worse for an\n\ninfarcted testicle. The patient will run a temperature, and if the situation is not\n\ndiagnosed, there will be an abscess because the tissue is dead. If the surgeon does not\n\ndrain it, the abscess will burst and discharge itself. He agreed that infection might\n\nfollow infarction. The scrotum will then be very bright red. When the pus comes to the\n\nsurface, it will be yellow. Inflammation does not show up as purplish or bluish black,\n\nwhich can only be produced by a haematoma under the skin. Dr Notley could not think of any\n\nmechanism that would produce a bright red coloured scrotum, which later became bluish\n\npurple or bluish black.147.    Where there is loss of blood supply, the testis\n\nturns pale in colour but the scrotum skin will probably retain its normal colour because\n\nthe blood supply to the scrotum has not been interfered with. Dr Notley however did not\n\nthink that Dr Tan tied up the arteries to Mr Harte’s testes. It would have to be a\n\nvery ‘ham-fisted operation’ and a very substandard operation if three arteries\n\nto each testis were tied up inadvertently. I share this view too.148.    Dr Notley disagreed that a ‘tinge of\n\nblue’ would describe a haematoma. Neither would that be an appearance from a\n\ncontusion injury. If he had to offer an explanation for the ‘tinge of blue’\n\ncolour observed by Dr Tan on 2 May 1997, Dr Notley proffered the incredible explanation\n\nthat perhaps Dr Tan was seeing the ‘black testicles shining deeply within the\n\nscrotum’ in the same way that our veins could be seen underneath the skin. I find Dr\n\nNotley’s explanation unconvincing having regard to the number of tissue layers\n\nprotecting the testes, which are buried deep within the scrotum.149.    When asked why the larger testicle ended up\n\nbeing smaller, Dr Notley said that the plaintiff had partial atrophy of his testicles from\n\nthe histology of the subsequent biopsies. So one testicle underwent further atrophy. It\n\ndid not make a difference whether it was due to contusion or infarction. In his opinion,\n\nno deductions could be made as to which mechanism or pathological process was operating.150.    Dr Notley conceded however that infarction of\n\nthe testicles from trauma could occur (without an associated scrotal haematoma) if the\n\ntrauma specifically damaged the blood vessels to the testicle in isolation without\n\ndamaging the blood vessels in the scrotum. However, Dr Notley thought that it would be\n\nvery difficult to damage the blood vessels within the testes without damaging the blood\n\nvessels in the scrotum at the same time.151.    Dr Notley explained infarction as the death of a\n\npiece of tissue due to the abolition of the blood supply to it. One could of course\n\nabolish the blood supply to a tissue by a blood clot, or by stuffing up the veins so that\n\nthe blood could not flow. Contusion on the other hand might cause haemorrhage of the blood\n\nvessels. If there was haemorrhage in the testes with coagulation, Dr Notley agreed that\n\nthe testicles could also infarct. Dr Notley said that if it was possible to have contusion\n\nof the testicular tissues without damaging the extratesticular tissues, the scrotum could\n\nstill turn red because of the infarction in the testes. The undamaged arteries to the\n\nscrotum would dilate to produce the inflammatory red reaction, whereas spillage of blood\n\nfrom damaged arteries into a foreign place where it was no longer oxygenated would cause\n\nit to turn blue-black. The following testimony by Dr Notley is relevant:His Honour: ..The infarction is very simple, in a contusion, you\n\n  contuse it, the vessels burst, and the vessels burst, the blood coagulates, and no blood\n\n  supplies come from that, you get an infarcted testis.Witness: Yes, you certainly will but—His Honour: So therefore the reaction for both infarcted testes,\n\n  whether – whatever means of causation, you land up with a reddish coloured looking\n\n  scrotum. That is provided the skin is not damaged.Witness: But I’m making the point, and I’m sorry to keep\n\n  going back to it---His Honour: Yes.Witness: -- as I do not believe you can contuse anything in that part\n\n  of the world with—His Honour: I’ll leave that aside, I’m coming to that—Witness: --without creating a haematoma.His Honour: Yes, I’m coming to that.Witness: But if you could in some magical way do that without contusing\n\n  the tissues outside artery, yes, you’re absolutely right, I agree with you, if you\n\n  could infarct the testicle in some way, you would end up with a situation of the bright\n\n  red swollen scrotum 12 or so hours later. So that I would go along with that completely. I\n\n  just put the caveat that I don’t believe you could do it without producing a\n\n  haematoma.His Honour: So now, the test now really is, would passing through a\n\n  smooth surface, smooth hard surface on one side only, produce damage to the skin? Because\n\n  I don’t expect the other side which touches his body will produce the skin trauma.\n\n  The other side, which is smooth, well, it’s a big question mark.Witness: But what we’re damaging with an injury to produce a\n\n  haematoma is the blood vessels within the substance of the scrotum beneath the skin. There\n\n  are no blood vessels of any size in the skin—His Honour: So it’s just sub-skin?Witness: Underneath the skin, there is this rich plexus of vessels\n\n  which I refer to, which is the radiator to keep the scrotum cool.His Honour: OK, let me ask you this question. Because the scrotum is\n\n  soft, right—Witness: Yes.His Honour: And if I were to press it, like you see here\n\n  (demonstrates), OK, and release after less than a second, and because the vessels in the\n\n  skin outside the testis is not packed into a balloon, will it burst these skin capillaries\n\n  to create that blue-black situation?Witness: Wouldn’t be the capillaries, your Honour.His Honour: Oh, those whatever blood vessels they may be, small\n\n  arteries.Witness: It would be the small blood vessels, veins and arteries—His Honour: Veins and arteries.Witness: -- underneath the skin. I believe they would, yes Sir. I\n\n  don’t believe you could create sufficient force onto a scrotum to rupture the blood\n\n  vessels inside the testicle without rupturing the blood vessel outside the testicle. Blood\n\n  vessels are the same whether they are inside or outside. It’s nothing to do with\n\n  being in a ---His Honour: The difference is the tunica. That’s what I’m\n\n  concerned with. The difference is the tunica.Witness: But the force you apply—His Honour: If all of them don’t have the tunica, then I will\n\n  agree with you. My problem is that this one is in the tunica, so there lies a difference.Witness: Well, I can’t agree with you, Sir.His Honour: You can’t agree with me. OK, fine.Witness: I’m sorry. I believe you would damage the blood vessels\n\n  in the scrotum. Blood vessels shear under these circumstances, and if you’re rolling\n\n  this chap off the toilet seat between his weight which--- I don’t know quite what\n\n  those kilograms are but, if his weight is bearing down sufficiently to produce your\n\n  theoretical 15 millimetres, that is going to produce a sufficient shearing force, as\n\n  it’s rolled over, which, if it damages the testicle itself, it will damage, to a\n\n  lesser extent, I accept, the blood vessels in the scrotum, and that would produce a\n\n  haematoma. I just do not believe the two things can be divorced. Doesn’t make sense,\n\n  it’s not logical.Q: Dr Notley, do you have any medical literature to back up what you\n\n  have just said?A: No, of course I don’t. Why should I have?His Honour: No, you see, Dr Notley, you see, if what you say is right,\n\n  then under—the part of his body near the, or rather, between the anus and the\n\n  suspended point of his testes which the testes is in contact, in the process of passing\n\n  through, one would also expect a blue-black. Biologically, but one wouldn’t—I\n\n  don’t think so.Witness: No, I don’t think you would, because the blue-black, the\n\n  thing that is being crushed is the scrotum, not the—His Honour: Yes, it’s the pressure, it’s the pressure because\n\n  the pressure acts both ways, so this is the hard part of the toilet seat, this is the\n\n  testis and on top is his body. So if you expect the skin here to be blue-black and the\n\n  skin on the top of the scrotum is blue-black, I would expect at the same time that the\n\n  skin underneath, on his body side, to be blue-black because they are all subjected to the\n\n  same pressure.Witness: But I sit on that piece of skin all my life, Sir, and I\n\n  don’t make haematomas.His Honour: That’s precisely the point, that’s precisely the\n\n  point. You sit on the skin all your life, there is no blue-black there.Witness: But I don’t sit on my balls.His Honour: Ah-huh, that’s what I mean by the difference, the\n\n  difference is in the tunica. You sit on the skin, it’s no problem.Witness: Or I sit on my scrotum as well.His Honour: The pressure could be very high, that’s my point, ah.\n\n  Can you explain? You’re sitting on the skin for a short while there, the skin of the\n\n  scrotum and not the skin of your flesh, no doubt. But there is no [haematoma.] Why?Witness: I mean, I think this theory is not a tenable one because I\n\n  just don’t believe you could roll a large man across a toilet seat or a flat floor or\n\n  a set of stones sufficiently to compress his scrotum and its internal contents, so that\n\n  you’ll get an intratesticular haematoma without shearing some of the blood vessels in\n\n  the scrotum. It simply does not—it’s not believable. I mean, the basis of injury\n\n  is that blood vessels get hit, they tear, they produce bruises, there is no literature as\n\n  far as I know about men falling off their scrotum and squashing their testicles.His Honour: No, no, that’s a different ball game, that’s a\n\n  physical problem which our engineers will be dealing with. I’m just interested in the\n\n  physiological aspects of it. You carry on.152.    Counsel in re-examination asked Dr Notley\n\nwhether there were differences between the scrotal skin and the skin of the buttocks for\n\ninstance. He said:The scrotal skin is lax and very elastic, it’s not very thick,\n\n  quite thin. The skin of the perineum, the area of the sit-upon which lies between the anus\n\n  and the buttocks is much thicker, it’s more securely fixed, so when you slide about\n\n  on a chair or a bicycle saddle, it doesn’t move, so you don’t get shearing\n\n  effects. The scrotal skin is, as I say, lax, and you can easily get shearing effects\n\n  particularly if you roll the scrotum or move the scrotum in the way that has been\n\n  described and if you roll yourself off a toilet seat in this way and shear your scrotum\n\n  sufficiently badly to produce an intratesticular haematoma, I can entirely imagine how the\n\n  shearing would produce haematoma, but I can’t imagine that the slide of the smooth,\n\n  much more supported skin of the back of the thighs and the back of the buttocks and the\n\n  perineum would shift in the way to produce shearing and haematoma formation. Obviously, if\n\n  it was a direct contusion, like a kick or a hammer, then, yes, you would certainly get a\n\n  haematoma on the perineum or the back of the buttocks, but I don’t think a slide of\n\n  this shearing nature would produce that lesion in those areas.Q: Mr Notley, what’s the incidence of fat in the scrotal skin as\n\n  opposed to, let’s say, the skin of the perineum or the buttocks or even the abdomen?A: There is very little fat in the scrotum, very little indeed, whereas\n\n  there is more fat underneath those other areas, parts of skin that you mentioned. But\n\n  there isn’t much fat beneath the perennial skin which is what you sit on.His Honour: How much pressure must there be? Let’s assume the\n\n  experiment is one whereby you just apply pressure, without any shearing, just press the\n\n  scrotal skin and then let go, will you get a haematoma?Witness: Well, you could do it you pressed it hard enough and for\n\n  several minutes.His Honour: What sort of pressures are you talking about?Witness: I don’t really know, but a common example is the\n\n  love-bite that people produce in the neck, that’s pressure on the skin over a period\n\n  of time, that’s a haematoma.153.    Dr Notley then concluded that it was not\n\nuncommon for injuries to result in scrotal haematomas and only very infrequently did they\n\nget testicular atrophy afterwards. A scrotal haematoma (i.e. extratesticular haematoma)per\n\nsedoes not cause atrophy of the testes. The published literature suggests that the\n\nscrotum is normally injured where testicular atrophy follows sufficiently severe trauma to\n\nthe testicle. There is no published literature indicating that one can have the sort of\n\ncatastrophic damage, which Mr Harte had, without physical damage to the scrotum in the\n\nform of a haematoma or abrasion of the skin. Many of these very severe traumas actually\n\ndisrupt the scrotum. Dr Notley was not aware of any reported cases of testicular atrophy\n\ndue to blunt trauma in which there had not been externally apparent injury to the scrotum\n\nin the form in its most minor way of a scrotal haematoma.154.    Dr Schlegel testified that a force applied\n\ndirectly to the testes sufficient to cause bilateral testicular atrophy would also be\n\napplied to the scrotum skin tissues. Fairly significant bruising and damage to these\n\ntissues would be expected as well.1stdefendant’s experts: A/Prof Li, A/Prof Foo and Dr Lei155.    Professor Li Man Kay (‘A/Prof Li’) is\n\nthe Senior Consultant and Head of the Division of Urology, Department of Surgery at the\n\nNational University Hospital. He testified that a compression injury might give rise to a\n\nhaematoma, which could be either extratesticular or intratesticular, or both.156.    Where the testes have been crushed internally,\n\nblood vessels within are ruptured. That causes congestion. An intratesticular haematoma\n\ndevelops. Whereas an extratesticular haematoma usually results from a direct hit on the\n\nscrotal skin. The ruptured blood vessels in the scrotal skin and adjacent dartos muscles\n\nleak out blood, thereby causing the extratesticular haematoma. Bleeding of the blood\n\nvessels in the external spermatic, cremasteric muscle and internal spermatic fascia will\n\nalso cause an extratesticular haematoma although this is less likely because these tissues\n\nare more mobile than the dartos muscles. The chances of injuring something mobile is less\n\nin a direct hit or in blunt trauma. In either case, the scrotum will appear black in\n\ncolour. A very big black scrotum the size of a mango definitely indicates substantial\n\nbleeding underneath the dartos muscle and in the subcutaneous area.157.    A/Prof Li further clarified that if there is no\n\ndamage to the blood vessels within the dartos muscle, but ‘blood is poured into the\n\nscrotal sac’ from another source, the scrotum skin will also look bruised and black\n\nbecause of the blood permeating through and causing discolouration to appear through the\n\nscrotal skin.158.    A/Prof Li then elaborated on the kinds of\n\nscrotal injuries that he had seen viz kicks, hits, fights, bicycle and motorcycle\n\naccidents, falls into drains and falls suffered by construction workers. The scrotum\n\nbruising showed up as a blue-black scrotum all the time.159.    I asked A/Prof Li specifically whether the\n\ndartos muscle in the scrotum would bleed in a particular situation where there is a\n\nrolling over the toilet seat when a person falls off, which is a different situation from\n\nthe case when the scrotum is hit [i.e. by strong impact forces or the like]. He answered\n\nin the positive but with a number of what I believe to be important qualifications. He\n\nsaid:His Honour: OK. So do you think, therefore, the rolling over a toilet\n\n  seat will cause the dartos muscle to bleed because it is not the hitting, you know. If he\n\n  falls off, let’s assume that he rolls over.Witness: The thing is, it really --- if you look at it this way, if we\n\n  purposely, like your Honour was saying \"I squeeze, and then I pay attention that I\n\n  only squeeze the balls and I don’t squeeze any other things\", that was a\n\n  scenario that it could happen but what I would say is, if somebody is rolling over, we\n\n  don’t know the speed. We know that there’s a ---His Honour: The speed, let’s assume it’s slow, not a speed of\n\n  a car, let’s say, this is slow roll over.Witness: Yes, OK.His Honour: Like a pancake, you know, you prepare a pancake, you roll\n\n  over, you know, the pancake, you have this thing to roll.Witness:And we also don’t know how much pressure is there\n\n  and how much pinching and crushing and weight and so on, we don’t really know but we\n\n  only know that he’s a big size chap.His Honour: Yes. And would the dartos muscle in that situation be\n\n  caused to bleed?Witness: Yes. The scenario, your Honour, that you gave was you avoid\n\n  but as far as I’m concerned, clinically, I have seen a lot of patients who had\n\n  scrotal injuries and so on, I have never seen the scrotum being spared, the skin being\n\n  spared. It is always the black bruise, the whole thing is black.160.    Due to the various qualifications, I cannot\n\nreasonably construe A/Prof Li’s answer to be that the plaintiff would necessarily\n\nhave a black swollen scrotum if he had a contusion injury. Many unknown factors come into\n\nplay. The examples given (from which A/Prof Li derived his opinion that a black bruise\n\ninvariably appears), are those where the impact forces are sudden and of short duration\n\nviz kicks, hits, fights, bicycle and motorcycle accidents, falls into drains, falls\n\nsuffered by construction workers. I can accept that the colour of the swollen scrotum may\n\nbe black in these categories of trauma because of the strong and sudden impact force which\n\nis likely to cause severe rupture and fairly extensive bleeding of the blood vessels\n\nwithin the dartos muscle, which with time may develop into a black swollen scrotum as\n\ndescribed by A/Prof Li.161.    However, the nature and magnitude of the\n\ncontusion forces acting on the testes in this case during a roll off from a toilet seat is\n\ntotally different (assuming that the testes in the scrotum were caught and pressed between\n\nthe hard but smooth toilet seat surface on one side and the soft area in the\n\nplaintiff’s perineum on the other side, and then sandwiched between the\n\nplaintiff’s fleshy thighs on both sides and his flaccid penis in the front). Clearly,\n\nthese contusion forces acting on the testes and scrotum skin tissues are not impact\n\nforces. I do not think that the expected result will necessarily be the same as that from\n\nimpact forces.162.    The rate and extent of the buildup of pressures\n\nand forces on the testes and scrotum skin tissues arising from a slow roll over are far\n\nmore gradual by comparison. It is wrong to think that the entire weight of 103.7 kg of the\n\nplaintiff was crushing the scrotum and testes at the point of roll over because the thighs\n\n(resting on the toilet seat) would still bear a substantial part of his torso weight. For\n\nthis reason, there is a fair probability that the contusion was not as severe as one might\n\nthink, although it remained sufficient to damage the internal of the testes. Hence, it is\n\nmuch too presumptive to conclude that the absence of a black scrotum automatically rules\n\nout the possibility of a moderate contusion injury to the testes.163.    A/Prof Li’s evidence of a black scrotum\n\nmust be made subject to the several qualifications that he himself had made earlier. My\n\nconclusion is supported by A/Prof Li’s evidence that it would be quite unusual to see\n\na black scrotum where there was no bruising on the skin. If there is crushing or rolling\n\nover by something smooth, then the skin may well be spared and hence, there will be no\n\nextratesticular bleeding in the scrotal tissues between the scrotal skin and the tunica\n\nalbuginea, and there will also be no black scrotum because the blood vessels in between\n\nthe skin and tunica are not damaged or at least not extensively damaged. But there can\n\nstill be an internally big intratesticular haematoma because of the damage to the blood\n\nvessels within the testes due to the crushing or rolling over by a smooth object.164.    Photograph D 51G shows the smooth and rounded\n\nedge of the same toilet seat that Mr Harte sat on when he fell off. This photograph shows\n\nthe position of his scrotum when Mr Harte was probably sitting upright as in photograph\n\nD51F and hence, his scrotum was lifted upwards. When his torso fell towards his thighs\n\n(i.e. when he would be bending downward and forward in the final stages of the fall), his\n\nscrotum naturally drooped much lower into the toilet bowl. This effect can be seen in\n\nphotographs D 51 D and E. In this position, the risk of his rather large scrotum (which I\n\nthink prior to the fall, would be even larger than that seen in photographs D 51D and E\n\nbecause he had much larger and presumably heavier testicles then) being caught and\n\nsquashed between his body and the top of the toilet seat during the fall is in my view\n\nmuch greater. A/Prof Li said that he would not expect any skin injury from abrasion. I\n\nagree with him that the injury if any to the testicles, the dartos or to any structure in\n\nthat area is likely to be caused by pressure principally.165.    During cross-examination of the 1stdefendant’s experts, Mr Kronenburg went on enthusiastically to explore all kinds of\n\nimaginable errors that Dr Tan could commit during his operation. I shall cite some of\n\nthem, which I find to be largely improbable upon closer examination.166.    The first is the inadvertent ligation and/or\n\ncutting of blood vessels. A/Prof Li testified that if the veins were cut without tying\n\nthem up and then allowed to bleed, a haematoma the size of a big mango would not form\n\nbecause the veins would stop bleeding after a bit of pressure. Unlike an artery, the\n\npressure of the blood oozing out of the veins would be relatively low. So it was unlikely\n\nto push to form a swelling the size of a mango. But where an artery was cut inadvertently,\n\nthe blood outflow pressure would be high. The resulting extratesticular swelling should\n\nconsequently be much larger. But A/Prof Li discounted the likelihood of an inadvertent\n\nsnipping of an artery during the surgery because a cut artery would spurt out blood like a\n\nsmall fountain. The blood would obscure the surgical field. Dr Tan would immediately\n\nrealise that he had accidentally cut an artery. The necessary measures to rectify the\n\nmistake could then be made.167.    Counsel then suggested the possibility of tying\n\nup the arteries inadvertently together with the varicose veins during the surgery. No\n\nblood would spurt out if he were to cut both the artery and vein together. While it is\n\ntrue that the surgeon is none the wiser, but there will be no extratesticular haematoma\n\nalthough there will be atrophy due to devascularisation. This does not fit the facts of Mr\n\nHarte’s case.168.    The significance of A/Prof Li’s evidence is\n\nthis. If indeed the vein ligations done by Dr Tan had slipped, the veins would be oozing\n\nout blood into the extratesticular area but that could only cause a small extratesticular\n\nhaematoma due to the low venous pressure. Since a large scrotum was presented, it\n\nsuggested that the cause could not be attributed to a failure of any of the 18 x 2 sutures\n\nused to tie up the 18 ligated and divided varicoseveins.169.    Counsel for the plaintiff then asked A/Prof Li\n\nwhether slipping of the knots at the inadvertently dividedarterywould lead\n\ninstead to a big extratesticular haematoma. He agreed it would, provided it was the knot\n\nat the pressure end and not the distal end that slipped. If the distal end slipped, it was\n\nall right. A/Prof Li added that slipping of knots is one of the problems of a new surgeon\n\nor a trainee.170.    A/Prof Li alluded to an interesting point that\n\nthe pressure within the scrotum was not very high at the time of the maximum swelling\n\nbecause it was pear shaped as drawn by Mr Harte. As an example, the pressure within a pear\n\nshaped balloon would not be as high as in a round balloon. The pear shape suggested that\n\nit was not likely that an open artery was pouring blood into the scrotum.171.    After considering the number of things that must\n\ngo wrong for this mode of negligence, I find it most unlikely having regard to the fact\n\nthat Dr Tan is a very experienced surgeon. Further, I do not think he is at the age where\n\nhe no longer has steady hands and good eyesight. In order for the bleak scenario painted\n\nby counsel to happen, the defendant would have to:(a) Inadvertently ligate and divide the arteries to the left and right\n\n  testes. Ligation of the testicular artery alone does not produce testicular infarction.\n\n  More than the testicular artery must be inadvertently tied up and divided on each side.\n\n  That accounts for two consecutive major errors.(b) Slipping of knots must occur separately on both sides as the\n\n  scrotum cavity is divided into two compartments by a septum and Mr Harte’s scrotum\n\n  swelled on both sides.(c) The knot slippage must be on the pressure side of the divided\n\n  artery and not on the distal side.172.    The likelihood of all these independent events\n\nhappening at the same time sounds absolutely remote to me. I thus rule it out as a\n\nfanciful possibility. The final answer from A/Prof Li that the blood flowing out of the\n\nartery would be able to track back up and result in bloody incision at the skin ends this\n\nspeculation because the skin incision and dressing on both sides were found to be clean\n\nand not stained with blood.173.    With an extratesticular haematoma, A/Prof Li\n\nbelieved that one would see bruising and a black discolouration. Upon palpitation, the\n\ndoctor would find a thick and less mobile scrotal skin. Normal skin is thin and mobile.174.    A/Prof Li confirmed that the black blood clots\n\nin the testes with intratesticular bleeding could not be seen through the scrotal skin. I\n\nagree with him. The skin should appear normal in colour although the testicle is enlarged\n\nbecause of the several layers enveloping each testis. Any change in colour of the scrotal\n\nskin can only be due to blood in the extratesticular region appearing near the dartos\n\nmuscles.175.    A/Prof Li said that he understood Dr Tan’s\n\ndescription of ‘scrotal haematoma’ in his clinical notes to mean a bruised and\n\nblack scrotum.176.    When A/Prof Li’s attention was drawn to the\n\nevidence of Mrs Harte of a bright red scrotum later changing to reddish purplish, A/Prof\n\nLi thought that it was not possible. He felt that her observation of a reddish-purplish\n\nscrotum was inconsistent with a scrotal haematoma because the main constituent of a\n\nscrotal haematoma is blood in the scrotum and that never goes reddish-purplish. Like all\n\nblood clots inside the body, it is black.177.    When it is bright red, it means that there must\n\nbe blood on or near the surface of the skin. But blood is not bright red, it is dull red\n\nin colour and blood never turns purple and neither will it turn reddish purple. A/Prof Li\n\ntestified that the colour of a haematoma is blackish, like the colour of hair. Therefore,\n\nhaemorrhaging within the dartos layer would not result in a red scrotum. Similarly a\n\nslipped knot resulting in bleeding into the scrotum would not produce a red coloured\n\nscrotum. Again it would be black. In the case of a fall, it was not inconceivable that the\n\nknots at the tied up veins might slip. A blood clot inside the body would also be black.\n\nIn a case of bleeding from a slipped knot, A/Prof Li postulated that the blood would take\n\nabout an hour to accumulate and the blood clot would be fully manifested say by 6 hours.178.    In the case of ligation of all the veins, the\n\ntestes would be fully congested within about 10 to 20 minutes. A nagging pain would be\n\nfelt. It would not be a sharp pain. The testes would bloat up to about double its size\n\nvolumetrically by the time the operation was over and the patient had awakened. He should\n\nbe able to see that his testes were larger. But the scrotum would be smaller than a mango.\n\nHowever, if not all the veins were tied up, the congestion would be proportionally less.179.    Dr Tan wrote the following in his medical notes:9 May 1997Haematoma subsidedComplained of hard testicles, left worse than right.Ultrasound scan: organised clot around left testicle, small hydroceleWants medical report.180.    A/Prof Li interpreted the ‘organised clot\n\naround the left testicle’ as an internal blood clotwithinthe testicle and\n\nnot one underneath the scrotal skin. He reinforced his testimony by saying that a scrotal\n\nhaematoma underneath the skin is normally very hard to find on ultrasound because it\n\nmerges with the tissues.From the ‘small hydrocele’, he concluded that there\n\nwas intratesticular bleeding. When the clot forms within a cavity, it pulls down into\n\ntwo separate layers. The top layer is the serum i.e. the hydrocele, and the lower layer is\n\nthe clot and this hydrocele was found inside the testis..181.    I consider this evidence to be very significant.\n\nIt confirms that there was internal bleeding in the testicle. If the veins were merely\n\ntied up or too many veins were tied up, I accept that devascularisation could occur but I\n\ndo not think there would be any bleeding. There might simply be thrombosis of the blood\n\nvessels and capillaries but there would be no rupture of these vessels or bleeding to\n\nleave behind an organised clot and a small hydrocele. This critical evidence clearly\n\nswings the balance of probability more in the direction of the contusion trauma and injury\n\nof the testes with rupture of the blood vessels within the testes. This conclusion is\n\nconfirmed by A/Prof Li that with an intratesticular haematoma, then there must be trauma\n\nor injury to the testicle.182.    A/Prof Li did not think that an immediate\n\noperation to drain the blood from the testes was necessarily a good idea. It was another\n\ngeneral anesthesia. Drainage of a haematoma may introduce infection because blood is a\n\nvery good medium for bacteria to grow and the scrotum is just next to the anus, which is a\n\npotentially contaminated area.183.    With regard to the intratesticular haematoma,\n\nA/Prof Li was of the opinion that Dr Tan would not be able to do anything to remedy the\n\nsituation. If the testicle was to be saved from atrophy, action should be taken within the\n\nfirst twenty hours or so. Beyond that it was hopeless. Even for an operation done within\n\ntwenty hours of injury, there was no guarantee that atrophy would not result. Therefore,\n\nthere was the possibility of salvage if the haematoma could be detected by 6.00 pm on the\n\nday of the operation. Timing would be critical. In his opinion, it was too late to save\n\nanything by 2 May 1997 if there was in fact internal testicular haemorrhage from the fall.184.    A/Prof Li then went on to explain the mechanism\n\nof necrosis. When the blood supply to an organ is reduced to 5 or 10% of what it was\n\nbefore, ischaemic changes occur. The organ may shrink in size. For instance, when there is\n\na decrease in the blood supply to the leg, there will be pain. Later, the big toe turns\n\nblack. As a result of a chronic lack of blood supply to the leg, the toe can even drop\n\noff.185.    Although A/Prof Li was unable to say what would\n\nhappen when the blood supply to the testicle dropped to 5 or 10%, he accepted that it was\n\npossible to get ischaemic necrosis through a decreased blood supply. As everything is\n\npossible in a biological human being, it is also possible to have a situation that the\n\nepididymis is alive and normal but not the testis, because the oxygen via the blood supply\n\nis somehow just sufficient for the smaller epididymis but insufficient for the relatively\n\nlarger organ, the testis. But he thought that a situation like this was unlikely and\n\nremote.186.    When the radiology report from Cabrini Medical\n\nCentre dated 21 October 1998 was shown to A/Prof Li by Mr Kronenburg, he agreed that the\n\nreduced perfusion sufficient to support the head of the epididymis was sufficient to\n\nsupport some spermatogenesis because ‘decreased spermatogenesis with only a few\n\nspermatids’ was found in the left testis although in the right testis, ‘no\n\nspermatozogenesis’ was found.187.    Based on the ultrasound report of Dr Koay on 11\n\nSeptember 1997, A/Prof Li understood that the testes were of small volume with atrophy\n\nhaving set in and they were almost dead. However the presence of tissue perfusion\n\nindicated that there was still some blood supply through the testes based on the CDUS\n\nscan.188.    Further the fact that both heads of the\n\nepididymis appeared normal as stated in Dr Koay’s ultrasound report confirmed this\n\nbecause the epididymis shared the same blood supply as the testis. If indeed Dr Tan had\n\ninadvertently ligated the artery or the veins, or in other words, if it were purely a\n\nblood supply or a venous congestion problem, the epididymis would have disappeared too.\n\nOne could not have the testis atrophying but not the epididymis. Based on logical\n\ndeduction, this substantially rules out the theory that all the veins/arteries, or far too\n\nmany veins/arteries were tied up because both the epididymis and testes should die or\n\natrophy together. A/Prof Li believed that if the epididymis survived a blood supply\n\nreduction of say 50%, the testes would similarly survive. But whatever decrease there\n\nmight be in the blood supply sufficient to cause death of the testis, it should also be\n\nsufficient to cause the epididymis to die. I fully agree. As an illustration, cutting the\n\nblood supply to the hand will also cut off the blood supply to the fingers. But with\n\ntrauma, one can damage the fingers without damaging the hand because it depends on where\n\nthe physical trauma happens to be inflicted.189.    According to A/Prof Li, the fact that there was\n\nsevere damage to the testes without corresponding damage to the epididymis in Mr\n\nHarte’s case indicated that it was more likely the result of trauma or contusion than\n\na case of loss of or insufficient blood supply. This evidence lends substantial support to\n\nthe defendant’s fall theory and undermines the plaintiff’s theory of a loss of\n\nor severe reduction of blood supply.190.    Following this, counsel for the plaintiff\n\nrightly explored the question whether both the testes and epididymis would suffer\n\ncontusion injury given the nature of the fall. A/Prof Li explained that the epididymis is\n\na very soft tissue. In a crushing or rolling situation, these soft tissues can yield to\n\nthe contusion. The epididymis is located at the top posterior of the testis. Assuming a\n\nfall from a toilet seat where the pelvic bone presses down on the testis, there will be\n\nsandwiching of the epididymis between the pelvic bone and the tunica. But there is the\n\npossibility of a rotation of the testis because there is a lot of freedom and the scrotal\n\nskin can stretch to allow the rotation. The significance then is that the forces are not\n\nacting directly on the epididymis if the testis rotates. To my mind, A/Prof Li has given a\n\nreasonable explanation why a contusion injury to the testes may not necessarily damage the\n\nepididymis. Unlike the testis, which is encased within a tough unstretchable membrane\n\ncalled the tunica albuginea, the epididymis is located outside this membrane. Being softer\n\nand having greater elasticity, the epididymis can easily stretch and thus yield to the\n\ncompression because it is not ‘compacted’ or ‘constrained’ so to speak\n\nwithin a fairly non-elastic container or tunica albuginea, which is being flattened. For\n\nthis reason, I accept that the epididymis can withstand pressure or contusion better than\n\nthe testis.191.    Interestingly, Dr Schlegel gave evidence in\n\nsupport of the fall theory when he said that an injury affecting directly the testicle\n\nfrom trauma would not usually affect the epididymis primarily either.192.    Even Dr Notley appeared to concur . He did not\n\nsee any reason why the epididymis would not survive when the testes were squeezed. Whether\n\nit was infarction or contusion, the epididymis might survive as it is a ‘pretty\n\ntough bit of equipment’. Thus the absence of damage to the heads of both\n\nepididymis does not rule out contusion as a cause of the bilateral testicular atrophy.193.    Associate Professor Foo Keong Tatt (‘A/Prof\n\nFoo’), the Senior Consultant Urologist and Head of the Department of Urology at the\n\nSingapore General Hospital, was called by the 1stdefendant as his medical\n\nexpert witness. He testified that one would find bruising, ecchymosis around the scrotum\n\nand possibly some abrasion on the scrotal skin and penis were a patient to suffer\n\ncontusion injury to the scrotal and testes sufficient to result in almost total testicular\n\natrophy. Similarly, Dr Clarence Lei Chang Moh, a consultant urologist at the Normah\n\nMedical Specialist Centre, Petra Jaya, Kuching, Sarawak, gave evidence that the scrotum\n\nwould appear ‘darkish, dark blue’ or ‘bruised and dark’ four days\n\nafter trauma to the scrotum. It would not be red anymore. Then Mr Lek asked Dr Lei for his\n\ndiagnosis if the grapefruit sized swollen scrotum had a ‘bluish tinge’ instead.\n\nDr Lei thought that if the testis had been normal before and there was a history of a\n\nfall, and the result was a dark, blue-black scrotum, then it was probably due to the fall.\n\nHe did not directly answer Mr Lek’s question.194.    Dr Lei then went on to deal with the other\n\nscenario when the testes were pressed and rolled over between a smooth hard surface and\n\nthe patient’s perineum (i.e. space between the anus and scrotum) and there was\n\nintratesticular injury as a result of that. He explained that there would probably not be\n\ninjury to the scrotal skin. He explained that the testis is an organ held by a very tight\n\ntunica and it cannot expand. Accordingly, the slightest pressure on it can cause\n\nintratesticular damage. In response to questions from Mr Lek, Dr Clarence Lei said:Q : … if there was intratesticular injury, OK, as a result of that\n\n  motion [i.e. pressing and rolling over], OK, would you agree that it is likely that at the\n\n  time, there would also be injury to the scrotal skin? Assuming there was intratesticular\n\n  injury, would that at the same time be injury to the scrotal skin?A : There may not be. In fact, I think probably there will not be\n\n  because the testis is an organ that is held by a very tight tunica and it cannot expand.\n\n  Soeven the slightest pressure on it can cause intratesticular damage,and I\n\n  think you can easily find out by doing your own experiment. You just squeeze your testes a\n\n  little, it’s going to hurt a lot because of that nature. It’s just like the\n\n  brain where it’s inside a very tight capsule. So, unfortunately, for the testes, no,\n\n  but if you say about the muscle, for example, you know, you damaged the muscle, then there\n\n  will be associated injury. If the muscle is damaged, then the skin will surely be damaged\n\n  but not for the testes.His Honour: It’s a very delicate structure, is it?Witness: Delicate structure with a tight capsule. So you can damage it\n\n  without damaging the skin very much, unfortunately, that’s what we are born with.Q: But if there was eventual total intratesticular atrophy, that means\n\n  not just merely injury but there was eventual total intratesticular atrophy, would you\n\n  agree that it is likely that there would be some injury to the scrotal skin?……A: ….But my opinion is that, that you can damage the testes\n\n  without significant damage to the scrotal skin because of this special arrangement.On the same issue, A/Prof Foo’s evidence was:Q : Would you require the tunica to stretch before you could say\n\n  atrophy would occur?A : The atrophy would ---the tunica itself cannot stretch because\n\n  it’s a very tough membrane, and that is the reason why when it bleeds inside within\n\n  the testicle, the pressure builds up, it’s like your skull, cannot stretch.Q : So, in other words ---A : So intra cranial haematoma is very dangerous.195.    From the medical and bioengineering point of\n\nview, I find these answers of Dr Lei and A/Prof Foo to be very sound, although it is a bit\n\nof an exaggeration to say that the ‘slightest pressure’ can cause\n\nintratesticular damage. More likely it is moderate pressure that can cause intratesticular\n\ndamage. I do not wish to be overly semantic about these things but what is important in my\n\nview is the mechanism of damage that Dr Lei and A/Foo had alluded to in their evidence,\n\nwhich must take account of the special biological construction or structure of the scrotum\n\nand testes.196.    All the while, the plaintiff and the 2nddefendants proceeded on the basis that there must necessarily be some skin abrasion and/or\n\nserious bruising of the scrotal skin whenever there is a rolling over or squeezing of the\n\ninternal testes. Clearly, there can be internal damage to the testes without the dark\n\ncolour associated with scrotal skin bruising. Because each testis is contained in a tough,\n\nfairly non-elastic capsule, any flattening of the capsule thus reducing its volume will\n\ncause the internal pressure to build up very rapidly in the tissue contents. Even\n\nbiological matter must obey the universal laws of physics. For instance, in a case\n\ninvolving a fixed mass of a gaseous substance maintained at the same temperature, the\n\npressure is inversely proportional to its volume. This is Bolye’s law. The smaller\n\nthe volume, the higher will be the internal pressure throughout that fixed mass of gaseous\n\nsubstance, and vice versa. In the case of a fixed mass of a liquid substance, which is\n\nlargely incompressible, the pressure in that liquid substance will increase very much more\n\nwhen the volume is reduced even slightly by compression. Where a fixed mass of liquid is\n\ncontained within a flexible capsule, and an external force is applied over a small area of\n\nthe capsule (i.e. an external pressure is applied on a small part of the external surface\n\nof the capsule), the pressure in the liquid throughout the capsule will rise such that it\n\nwill be equal to that external pressure being applied. Therefore, if a man were to sit on\n\nhis scrotum and thereby exert a strong external pressure on the tunica albuginea encasing\n\nhis testes, that strong external pressure will be transmitted internally throughout the\n\ntesticular tissue within the tunica albuginea, assuming that there is no rupture.197.    Thus by flattening or compressing the tunica\n\nalbuginea, the corresponding increase in pressure throughout the testicular tissue encased\n\nwithin the tunica albuginea may rise to a level where it causes microvascular damage by\n\ntwo modes (a) direct damage to the tissue cells and (b) rupture or tearing of the delicate\n\ncapillary vessels with resulting haemorrhage within the testes due to the elongation or\n\nstrain from the flattening process. A reasonably good analogy will be the air\n\n(representing the testicular tissue contents) enclosed in a balloon (representing the\n\ntunica envelop). Flattening the balloon will raise the internal air pressure all round and\n\nthe balloon will be forced to elongate.198.    Therefore, moderately intense squeezing of the\n\ntestis is likely to cause microvascular damage to the delicate tissues encased within the\n\ntunica albuginea, which can subsequently damage the whole or part of the testis.199.    I find support from the evidence of Dr Tay Kah\n\nPhuan who confirmed the two ways in which compression pressure causes damage. One is\n\ncontusion pressure on the cells themselves and the cells die. The direct contusion force\n\ncan also disrupt the tissue and cause it to die. The second is microvascular rupture of\n\nblood vessels. Due to the rupture, there is a buildup of pressure that can subsequently\n\ninfarct the testes. Sometimes, one cannot tell which comes first.200.    A/Prof Foo also clarified that there are no\n\nnerves within the actual tissues inside the testis. With the squeezing of the testis, it\n\nis the stretching of the tunica covering that causes the pain, not the damage to the\n\ninternal tissues of the testesper se.201.    I then clarified with A/Prof Foo on the\n\nmechanism of the pain in the scrotal region:A: So, a pressure causing – a pressure that would cause the tunica\n\n  to stretch would also cause pain?His Honour: No, you see, the cause of the pain is the stretching ---Mr Kronenburg: Yes.His Honour: So, if it is damageper sewithin the layer without\n\n  stretching you won’t feel pain. That’s why I’ve to establish that.\n\n  It’s only after the thing stretches due to congestion and so on and coagulation, then\n\n  the pain begins as it stretches. Because the stretching is where the nerve detects the\n\n  stretching. That’s where you get the pain. If the tunica doesn’t stretch, you\n\n  damage the inside, he says you won’t feel the pain because there are no nerves\n\n  inside.Witness: That’s right, your Honour.……Q : Professor, if the Plaintiff had a squeezing contusion injury to the\n\n  extent that atrophy resulted, would he feel pain – yes, maybe, or no? If the\n\n  Plaintiff had a squeezing contusion injury to the extent that atrophy resulted,\n\n  wouldn’t he feel pain --His Honour: When, the question is when.Mr Kronenburg: Yes, I was going to ---Witness : That’s what I’m going to explain. Initially there\n\n  may be pain.Q: But subsequently?A: Subsequently there may not be pain ---Q: Immediately after?A: Immediately after, there may be pain and then the pain will subside,\n\n  but as the pressure builds up within the tunica ---His Honour: Pain comes back again?Witness: That’s right, your Honour.His Honour: All right.Q: So there will be pain and the pain will disappear, then the pain\n\n  will come back again?A: That’s right, your Honour.Q: But you’re certain there will be pain at the outset?A: Initially. Yes.His Honour: Which is for a short while, is it?Witness: Yes, Your Honour.202.    Dr Notley in his rebuttal evidence substantially\n\nconfirmed what A/Prof Foo had said was the pattern of the pain: \"And, of course,\n\nwith the infarction as with the haematoma, the pain will subside over the next few days.\n\nAnd so by four days, it might not be so painful.\" Dr Notley explained that the\n\npain in testicular contusion or injury would be felt instantly as the injury occurred. The\n\npain intensity would probably be very high at the time of the injury and would last for a\n\nfew minutes. But over the next few minutes, the severe pain would subside leaving the\n\npatient with a nasty and unpleasant ache. And if the testicle was injured, that nasty\n\nunpleasant ache would gradually increase over the next few hours because the full force of\n\nthe patient’s blood pressure would be pushing into the swollen testicle causing\n\ntension in the inelastic tunica albuginea. So the pain would come on within a few hours of\n\nthe dull, unpleasant natured pain.203.    In contra-distinction, infarction would not be\n\npainful initially, no more painful than a patient who had excision of a varicocele which\n\ndid not produce infarction. Because the pressure would be gradually rising within the\n\ntesticle and within the tunica albuginea, this pain would be a dull pain, not a sharp\n\nacute pain. According to Dr Notley, the dull pain would come on gradually over a matter of\n\nhours, building up, starting probably as a mild ache a few hours afterwards and then\n\ngetting worse and worse, and probably peak ten to twelve hours later.204.    The apparently irreconcilable evidence is that\n\nby 7.00 p.m., Mr Harte still did not feel any pain except discomfort and a dull ache at\n\nhis scrotum when he left the hospital. If there was any severe contusion injury, I think\n\nhe should have felt the pain. Since there was no complaint of acute pain, it appears\n\neither that (a) there was no contusion injury, or (b) the contusion injury might only be\n\nmoderate in magnitude. This calls for closer examination.205.    Since Mr Harte could feel the pain from the bump\n\non his head, I have to rule out the possibility that the pain killer tablets consumed by\n\nMr Harte after surgery (if any) and the remaining effects of the general anaesthesia were\n\nof such magnitude that they completely removed his ability to detect pain in his scrotum.\n\nI expect that Mr Harte would be more sensitive to pain in his testes than on his forehead.\n\nI also note that Mr Harte could feel discomfort from the minor swelling in his scrotum\n\nwhen he was recovering in the day ward after the surgery. This again suggests to me that\n\nthe anaesthesia wore off fairly quickly. If indeed there was a severe and substantial\n\nblunt trauma to the testes, it is surprising that the acute pain would have escaped Mr\n\nHarte. But where the blunt trauma is moderate, then it is not beyond believability that Mr\n\nHarte could not, after regaining consciousness, detect the pain because it might not be as\n\nacute and that pain might have passed away or significantly reduced by the time he\n\nrecovered from his syncope. It is not improbable that Mr Harte did not complain of the\n\npain because he was already expecting discomfort, pain and swelling from the testicular\n\ncongestion due to ligation of veins, which is inherent in a varicocele operation. As Dr\n\nTan’s operation on Mr Harte was bilateral in nature (as opposed to the unilateral\n\nvaricocele operation on the left side by Dr Dubin), I suppose even greater pain and\n\ndiscomfort were to be expected. Thus, Mr Harte was content not to complain.206.    I find that the forces involved in a non-violent\n\nroll over and compression/squeezing of the testes are dissimilar in nature and are\n\nprobably of lesser magnitude in comparison with those in the typical impact trauma\n\nsituation involving for instance, a violent kick, or a motorcycle accident, where a sudden\n\nlarge impact force hits the scrotum and testes. In my considered opinion, the contusion in\n\nMr Harte’s case involved only a moderate non-impact force. It was more a gradual\n\nsqueezing of the testes, as his heavy body rolled over his scrotum during the fall off the\n\ntoilet seat. The duration of application of the force would be about a second or less. The\n\nresulting pain envisaged in this situation would probably not be acute and would have\n\ndiminished quickly and not be noticeable by Mr Harte by the time he regained\n\nconsciousness. The absence of a rupture of the tunica albuginea also suggests that the\n\ncompressive force was not particularly severe. A/Prof Foo did not think that Mr Harte\n\nsuffered any rupture of the tunica albuginea based on the medical evidence.207.    Nevertheless, the probability of internal\n\nmicrovascular damage cannot be excluded. If the damage is microvascular in nature within\n\nthe testicular tissues (which I am made to understand do not have any nerves), I doubt\n\nvery much that the microbleeding itself is going to cause much pain. When the\n\nmicrobleeding or haemorrhage feeding the growing intratesticular haematoma starts to swell\n\nand stretch the intact tunica albuginea and exert pressure on it, then the pain will\n\nbegin. As the intratesticular swelling and pressure slowly increase, the pain will also\n\ngradually increase. Looked at from this angle, I find that the pain symptoms from moderate\n\ncontusion and microvascular damage are largely consistent with the absence of clear signs\n\nof acute pain and the presence of a dull pain and some minor swelling when Mr Harte was in\n\nhospital waiting to be discharged. They are also consistent with the acute pain that Mr\n\nHarte felt only on the following morning after the surgery, when he experienced fairly\n\nsubstantial swelling.208.    The important outcome of the above analysis is\n\nthat the absence of acute pain does not rule out contusion as a probable cause of the\n\ndevascularisation damage in the testes. I believe that the absence of acute pain can only\n\nexclude severe impact injuries and severe contusionsbut not those which are\n\nmoderate in magnitude.209.    A/Prof Foo was then asked specifically to\n\ndescribe the pain pattern for a case of trauma leading to intratesticular injury\n\nsufficient to lead to testicular atrophy. His view was that Mr Harte would slowly develop\n\npain and a scrotal haematoma. Unless the pain was very severe, he might sometimes feel\n\nnausea. If there was severe nausea, the patient would vomit. After 4 days, there would be\n\na big haematoma. It would be difficult to feel the testes, and therefore, it would be\n\ndifficult to ascertain whether the haematoma was extratesticular or intratesticular. But\n\nA/Prof Foo thought that sometimes the pain would subside by the fourth day or the person\n\nmight get used to the pain. The haematoma would harden.210.    As for venous congestion due to an inappropriate\n\nor negligent surgical procedure, A/Prof Foo agreed that it would take a few minutes for\n\nthe pressure to build up in the testes after tying up the veins. However, it would take a\n\nfew hours for the swelling to build up depending on the extent of the venous impairment or\n\ncongestion. Interestingly, A/Prof Li said that the pain arising from venous congestion was\n\nnot sudden but would build up slowly. With partial and not total impairment of venous\n\nflow, the congestion might take longer to build up. If this was the mechanism of\n\ndevascularisation, then it would be similar to the discomfort and dull pain felt after the\n\noperation and over the next 12 hours.211.    I am persuaded by the preponderance of expert\n\nmedical opinion to conclude that the absence of acute pain cannot exclude either venous\n\nimpairment damage through careless surgery on the one hand, or microvascular bleeding and\n\nhaemorrhage from contusion damage on the other. That also means that the absence of\n\nvomiting and nausea felt by Mr Harte after the fall does not exclude either a surgical\n\ncause or contusion damage.",
        "Defence of 1stdefendant": "212.    The 1stdefendant, Dr Tan, attributed\n\nthe testicular atrophy entirely to the fall in which the plaintiff’s exposed scrotum\n\nwas squashed between the toilet seat and his heavy torso, as his body collapsed forward\n\nand eventually slid off the toilet seat in an unconscious state with his head hitting the\n\nfloor first.213.    On being told of the fall and the injury on the\n\nhead, Dr Tan sent for a neurosurgeon, Dr Balagi, to examine Mr Harte. Dr Tan never asked\n\nfor more information, and hence, he never received all the details about the fall. Dr\n\nBalagi saw Mr Harte twice and diagnosed \"syncope\" fainting, which Dr Tan said\n\nexplained in part why the plaintiff did not feel pain in his scrotum area.214.    As I have said above, even if full details of\n\nthe fall were provided, a reasonably careful and competent urologist might not visualise\n\nor realise that the testes could be contused by a fall in an unconscious state from a\n\ntoilet seat. Being such an unusual and rare occurrence, I accept Dr Tan’s defence\n\nthat atrophic damage to testes arising from a fall from a toilet seat is not a reasonably\n\nforeseeable consequence.215.    As such, I find that no negligence arises from\n\nDr Tan’s failure to examine Mr Harte before his discharge from the hospital. Whether\n\nthe reasons proffered by Dr Tan for not seeing him are reasonable or not need not concern\n\nme. Neither is it relevant whether his message to the plaintiff to wait for him was in\n\nfact conveyed to Mr Harte. It makes no difference as Dr Tan would have discharged Mr Harte\n\neven if Dr Tan did examine him personally. I doubt that Dr Tan would have been able to\n\ndiagnose a potentially dangerous intratesticular haematoma developing at that stage,\n\nespecially when Mr Harte had not complained of any serious pain and there were no obvious\n\nsigns of bruising or swelling.216.    Dr Myint Soe stressed that the 1stdefendant is a FRCS (General Surgeon) as well as a specialist FRCS (Urology). He is the\n\nonly one in Singapore with a FRCS (Urology) qualification. He had received extensive\n\ntraining in hospitals in England and in Singapore before he set up his own private\n\npractice. Varicocelectomy is a minor operation involving only day surgery. He has done far\n\nmore difficult operations like kidney transplants. Furthermore, he has done about 200\n\nvaricocelectomies including those via the subinguinal approach. So far, he has never\n\nencountered any disasters of any kind. Neither has he made any blunders in any of his more\n\ndifficult operations. Basically, to have blundered twice in two consecutive simple\n\noperations causing atrophy on both sides must be so remote as to be statistically\n\nimprobable having regard to his experience and his numerous previous successful\n\noperations.217.    I consider this statistical argument to be a\n\npoint in favour of Dr Tan that he could not have botched up the simple operation twice.\n\nWhat is statistically significant and hardly to be ignored is the very strange coincidence\n\nthat the allegedly consecutive substandard operation is accompanied by a fall. Without\n\nanything else, immediate suspicion will be cast on the fall as being the more likely cause\n\nthan the alleged negligence of a competent and very experienced urologist. This\n\nstatistical analysis will be considered in more detail subsequently.218.    The 1stdefendant testified that he\n\nused the recognised subinguinal approach, which allows access to the external veins. His\n\nmethod of surgery using optical lubes is recognised. New medical studies have advocated an\n\naggressive approach to ligate all the veins leaving just one set of veins to the vas\n\nintact and there should be no adverse consequences such as venous congestion. Dr Tan\n\nopined that he was in fact much far more conservative as he had left many other veins\n\nintact during his operation. First, he took care to ensure that the vas and the bundle of\n\nvessels were identified and kept out of the surgical field after opening the cremasteric\n\nfascia. This ensured that some veins and the vasal artery were kept intact. He was trained\n\nto do this and he followed this standard procedure. I find no reason to disbelieve him on\n\nthis. Besides leaving the vasal veins untouched, he also spared the gubernacular veins\n\nthereby reserving more than adequate channels for venous drainage. Since he did not\n\ndeliver the testes out during the surgery, he had not ligated or cut any of the\n\ngubernacular veins, which were at the bottom end of the testes. On these aspects of his\n\noperation, Dr Tan was not shaken in cross-examination and had steadfastly maintained that\n\nhe had left the vasal artery and vasal veins intact together with the vas.219.    The 1stdefendant explained that in a\n\nlattice like network of varicocele veins, the tributaries of the same dilated vein could\n\nbe cut twice, counting as 2 cuts, which gave the wrong impression that an unduly large\n\nnumber of veins were ligated. Lower down at the subinguinal level, the number of veins\n\nincreases due to branching as one gets closer to the pampiniform plexus and the scrotum\n\nlevel, where for instance, for each internal spermatic vein encountered higher up at the\n\ninguinal canal level, two to four tributaries may be encountered at the lower level of the\n\nplexus, the lattice like network of intercommunicating veins. This accounts for the larger\n\nnumber of veins (subcutaneous veins, the external veins and the cremasteric veins) ligated\n\nnormally lower down at the subinguinal level as compared to an operation higher up at the\n\ninguinal level.220.    Dr Schlegel agreed that the 1stdefendant’s surgical procedure described by him would generally fit the standard of\n\ncare for treatment of a varicocele. I cannot find any objective evidence from which to\n\ninfer that Dr Tan could not have done what he said he did. In the absence of such\n\nevidence, I have no reason to disbelieve his testimony on how he performed the operation.221.    Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein in an article\n\n‘Anatomical Approach to Varicocelectomy’ described their preferred inguinal\n\napproach to varicocelectomy, where they said:…All external spermatic veins are identified and doubly ligated ..\n\n  and divided. The gubernaculum is inspected for the presence of veins exiting from the\n\n  tunica vaginalis. These are either cauterized, doubly ligated or clipped, and divided.\n\n  …. All internal spermatic veins, even very small veins should be ligated. On\n\n  completion of the dissection, the spermatic cord is run over the index finger to confirm\n\n  that all veins have been ligated…… At least one set of blood vessels around the\n\n  vas deferens should be preserved because they allow the only egress of blood from the\n\n  testis.222.    From the above passage, it can be seen that very\n\naggressive ligation of as many veins as possible (including very small veins) was\n\nadvocated by Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein. Dr Goldstein in Chapter 19: \"Mini-Incision\n\nMicrosurgical Inguinal or Subinguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis\"\n\nin his book \"Surgery of Male Infertility\" stated at page 177 that:The vas deferens is always accompanied by two sets of vessels.As\n\n  long as at least one set of vasal veins remains intact, venous congestion will not occur.223.    The above statement is also repeated in the\n\njoint paper by Goldstein, Gilbert, Dicker, Dwosh and Gnecco in \"Microsurgical\n\nInguinal Varicocelectomy with Delivery of the Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing\n\nTechnique\".224.    In essence, leaving untouched only the vasal\n\nvein at the vas deferens is sufficient to prevent vascular damage to the testes. This\n\nevidence representing the views of a number of responsible urologists, later confirmed by\n\nDr Schlegel in his testimony, isfatalto the plaintiff’s postulation\n\nof excessive division of veins by Dr Tan as the cause of the devascularisation.225.    I accept that Dr Tan had left all the arteries\n\nincluding the vasal artery intact. He did not ligate and divide the vasal vein. He also\n\nleft some other veins behind as shown in D29. I find that there was adequate blood supply\n\nto and sufficient venous drainage from both his testes. As such, Dr Tan’s operation\n\ndid not cause the devascularisation, which led to Mr Harte’s substantial testicular\n\natrophy.226.    Having failed in this direction, counsel for the\n\nplaintiff spent a considerable amount of time taking issue with all imaginable ways that\n\nDr Tan might have misused the Babcock forceps, one of which was that Dr Tan might have\n\napplied too much pressure on the spermatic cord when he used it to pull it out of the skin\n\nincision and the other was clamping the arteries between the rounded ‘teeth’ of\n\nthe Babcock forceps, just to cite two examples. In my opinion, the foray into this area\n\nwas not fruitful.227.    Counsel for the plaintiff invited Dr Notley to\n\ngive a multitude of examples on how the misuse of the forceps would lead to\n\ndevascularisation: closing the ends on the blood vessel and damaging the blood vessels,\n\ntwisting the forceps through 180 degrees together with the vessels within it, undue\n\ntraction on the Babcock forceps obstructing the flow of blood through the vessels thereby\n\ncausing thrombosis, which is a very likely cause of devascularisation. Without some\n\nsupporting evidence, these countless possibilities remain in the speculative realm and\n\nhave little weight. Speculation on all sorts of possibilities is not going to get the\n\nplaintiff very far.228.    Dr Schlegel initially also asserted that the\n\nclamping and pulling of the vas deferens and blood vessels with the Babcock forceps could\n\nhave actually damaged those blood vessels. I then note that Dr Schlegel uses it as well.\n\nThis is an atraumatic instrument with curved rounded edges. Dr Tan maintained that he had\n\nheld the sides of the spermatic cord where there were no major arteries to bring it out to\n\nthe skin level as was recommended by Marmar and Kim. He did not encircle the spermatic\n\ncord within the Babcock forceps. At worst, if he had applied too much pressure momentarily\n\nsay for 10 seconds as he pulled out the spermatic cord, devascularisation could not\n\npossibly happen. A period of 10 seconds is far too short for any cell death to occur\n\nthrough lack of oxygenated blood flow. Just for the sake of comparison, the medical\n\nevidence before me was that salvage of the testes must be done within 6 hours if the blood\n\nsupply is choked off due to a torsion injury, which necessarily implies that a temporary\n\nshut off of blood supply to the testis for any reason during the 1  hour operation is\n\nnot likely to cause any cell death or testicular death through devascularisation.229.    I thus accept the submission of counsel for Dr\n\nTan that even if he had occluded the blood supply, it could not have been for a sufficient\n\nlength of time to cause vascular damage of the kind seen.230.    Dr Tan testified that he used the Babcock\n\nforceps to isolate and keep the vas and its vessels out of harm’s way. If he had\n\ninadvertently kinked the vessels with the Babcock forceps, the effects would be obvious\n\nbecause the veins would swell up or get engorged. Hence, I would imagine that he would\n\nhave remedied the obvious problem immediately. Even if his use of the Babcock forceps had\n\ndamaged any vasal artery, there were two other sets of arteries, viz the testicular and\n\nthe cremasteric arteries to supply the blood to the testicles. Atrophy would not likely\n\noccur.231.    I also note that the plaintiff’s expert\n\nwitness on biomechanics, A/Prof Lim Chwee Teck had produced a document P54 from ‘Data\n\nBook on Mechanical Properties of Living Cells, Tissues and Organs’ verifying the\n\ndegree to which arteries can be stretched. It appears from the yield strain data that\n\narteries can tolerate stretching up to 34 %, which indicates that they are fairly flexible\n\nand can safely withstand a fair amount of stretching. This proves that arterial damage is\n\nunlikely when the arteries are a little stretched in the process of bringing the spermatic\n\ncord to the skin level. It is fanciful to think that these arteries are so extremely\n\ndelicate when they are not. Fortunately, Mother Nature has provided a certain level of\n\ninbuilt tolerance and robustness in these arteries because they have to transport blood\n\nunder pressure to all parts of the human body, and are subject to movements and stretching\n\nwhen a human being runs and exercises.",
        "Defence of 2nddefendants": "232.    Mr Harte had of his own volition chosen to\n\nconsult Dr Tan for his fertility treatment and varicocele operation.233.    The 2nddefendants’ defence was\n\nthat Dr Tan was not their employee, servant or agent. The 2nddefendants and Dr\n\nTan never represented to the plaintiff that Dr Tan was ever an employee, servant or agent\n\nof the 2nddefendants. Dr Tan has his own private clinic. In legal parlance, Dr\n\nTan is an independent contractor. He is merely accredited to use the 2nddefendants’ hospital facilities and has been granted admitting privileges for his\n\npatients.234.    Mr Harte could not be mistaken that he was\n\nconsulting a private specialist because the signboard outside Dr Tan’s clinic would\n\nhave clearly shown that his clinic was not part of the hospital establishment at all.\n\nOfficial receipts given to the plaintiff showed that they were issued by H H Tan Urology\n\nCentre Pte Ltd of #04-03 Gleneagles Medical Centre Singapore 258499.235.    Similarly, when he went to Sheng Yu Laboratory\n\nof #07-11 Specialists’ Centre for his basic seminal analysis, for which he was\n\nseparately issued a receipt, it must be clear to Mr Harte that the laboratory test was not\n\ndone by the hospital but by a private agency.236.    Balanced against these were the direct payments\n\nto the hospital on the day of the surgery on admission. He paid an initial deposit of $300\n\nto the hospital upon his admission for the surgery. He paid a total of $4,803.68 again to\n\nthe hospital when he was discharged after the surgery. Both receipts represented that he\n\nwas paying to ‘Gleneagles Hospital Singapore, 6A Napier Road Singapore 258500’.237.    There was no breach of contract between the\n\nplaintiff and the 2nddefendants. The 2nddefendants’ contract\n\nwith the plaintiff was contained in the 2nddefendants’ \"Conditions\n\nof Service/Hospital Policies\" dated 28 April 1997, which was for the provision by the\n\n2nddefendants of hospitalisation services to the plaintiff in consideration of\n\nthe plaintiff agreeing to pay the 2nddefendants all fees and expenses for the\n\nsame. There was no allegation of any breach of this contract by the 2nddefendants.238.    There was no battery or trespass on the person\n\nof Mr Harte as all treatment, care and attention administered to him during his stay in\n\nthe hospital was undertaken with his consent.239.    The 2nddefendants maintained that\n\nthey were not negligent with regard to the fall in the toilet. There was also no\n\nallegation by the plaintiff that the fall was caused by the 2nddefendants’ negligence. Having regard to the undisputed fact that it was Mr Harte who\n\nhad, against the nurse’s advice, insisted on going to the toilet, Mr Harte must\n\naccept full responsibility for his own fall whilst seated on the toilet bowl. If he did\n\nsuffer any contusion of his testes as a result of the fall, he should not blame others for\n\nit. He could not say that the contusion was caused by the negligence of the hospital. I\n\nentirely agree.",
        "The Law": "240.    There is no dispute as to what the law is in\n\nrelation to the standard of care required in the area of medical negligence as it is\n\nfairly well settled. Judith Prakash J in a recent decision inJason Carlos Rancisco v\n\nDr L. M. Thng & Anor(Suit No 573 of 1998) had succinctly and clearly set out the\n\nlaw and I can do no better other than to quote paragraphs 106 and 107 of the learned\n\njudge’s decision, which I most respectfully adopt:106. The duty of the medical practitioner is to exercise reasonable\n\n  skill and care in treating his patient and the burden lies on the plaintiff to satisfy the\n\n  court that the defendant was in breach of his duty. Reasonable skill and care are assessed\n\n  on the basis of the standard of the ordinary skilled man exercising and professing to have\n\n  that special skill and not on the standard of the highest expert. This is what is known as\n\n  the ‘Bolam test’ taken from the direction to the jury of Mc Nair J inBolam v\n\n  Friern Hospital Management Committee[1957] 1 WLR 582. This test has been restated\n\n  many times and has been approved by the House of Lords in cases likeWhite House v\n\n  Jordan[1981] 1 All ER 267 andSidaway v Board of Governors of the Bethlem Royal\n\n  Hospital[1985] 1 All ER 643.107.    The standard of care has been held to be a\n\n  matter of medical judgment inSidawaywhere Lord Scarman stated:‘TheBolamprinciple may be formulated as a rule but a\n\n    doctor is not negligent if he acts in accordance with a practice accepted at the time as\n\n    proper by a responsible body of medical opinion even though other doctors adopt a\n\n    different practice. In short the law imposes a duty of care; but the standard of care is a\n\n    matter of medical judgment’.241.    The learned judge also accepted the following\n\nformulation of the law by Lord Scarman inMaynard v West Midlands Regional Health\n\nAuthority[1984] 1 WLR 634 at p 638-639:A case which is based on an allegation that a fully considered decision\n\n  of two consultants in the field of their special skill was negligent clearly presents\n\n  certain difficulties of proof. It is not enough to show that there is a body of competent\n\n  professional opinion which considers that theirs was a wrong decision, if there also\n\n  exists a body of professional opinion, equally competent, which supports the decision as\n\n  reasonable in the circumstances. It is not enough to show that subsequent events show that\n\n  the operation need never have been performed, if at the time the decision to operate was\n\n  taken it was reasonable in the sense that a responsible body of medical opinion would have\n\n  accepted it as proper …I would only add that a doctor who professes to exercise a special\n\n  skill must exercise the ordinary skill of his speciality. Differences of opinion and\n\n  practice exist, and will always exist, in the medical as in other professions. There is\n\n  seldom any one answer exclusive of all others to problems of professional judgment. A\n\n  court may prefer one body of opinion to the other: but that is no basis for a conclusion\n\n  of negligence.…..….I have to say that a judge’s ‘preference’ for one\n\n  body of distinguished professional opinion to another also professionally distinguished is\n\n  not sufficient to establish negligence in a practitioner whose actions have received the\n\n  seal of approval of those whose opinions, truthfully expressed, honestly held, were not\n\n  preferred. …in the realm of diagnosis and treatment negligence is not established by\n\n  preferring one respectable body of professional opinion to another. Failure to exercise\n\n  the ordinary skill of a doctor (in the appropriate speciality, if he be a specialist) is\n\n  necessary.’242.    Judith Prakash J. emphasized that the judge has\n\nto exercise his own critical faculties and not simply be swept along by the opinion of the\n\nmedical experts. I agree with her completely as can be seen later in this case, I found\n\nmyself unfortunately in complete disagreement with the medical experts called both by the\n\nplaintiff and the 1stdefendant, particularly in relation to their expert\n\nopinion that the colour of a scrotal haematoma from physical trauma is necessarily\n\n‘as black as hair’, ‘black as a gown’ or ‘blue-black’.243.    Just as with the learned judge, I accept the\n\nauthoritative proposition of law stated by Lord Browne-Wilkinson inBolitho v. City and\n\nHackney H.A.(H.L.(E.)) [1998] A.C.232, which clarifies the ambit of theBolamtest:….in my view, the court is not bound to hold that a defendant\n\n  doctor escapes liability for negligent treatment or diagnosis just because he leads\n\n  evidence from a number of medical experts who are genuinely of opinion that the\n\n  defendant’s treatment or diagnosis accorded with sound medical practice.……….in cases of diagnosis and treatment there are cases where,\n\n  despite a body of professional opinion sanctioning the defendant’s conduct, the\n\n  defendant can properly be held liable for negligence (I am not here considering questions\n\n  of disclosure of risk). In my judgment that is because, in some cases, it cannot be\n\n  demonstrated to the judge’s satisfaction that the body of opinion relied upon is\n\n  reasonable or responsible. In the vast majority of cases the fact that distinguished\n\n  experts in the field are of a particular opinion will demonstrate the reasonableness of\n\n  that opinion. In particular, where there are questions of assessment of the relative risks\n\n  and benefits of adopting a particular medical practice, a reasonable view necessarily\n\n  presupposes that the relative risks and benefits have been weighed by the experts in\n\n  forming their opinions. But if, in a rare case, it can be demonstrated that the\n\n  professional opinion is not capable of withstanding logical analysis, the judge is\n\n  entitled to hold that the body of opinion is not reasonable or responsible.I emphasise that in my view it will very seldom be right for a judge to\n\n  reach the conclusion that views genuinely held by a competent medical expert are\n\n  unreasonable. The assessment of medical risks and benefits is a matter of clinical\n\n  judgment which a judge would not normally be able to make without expert evidence. As the\n\n  quotation from Lord Scarman makes clear, it would be wrong to allow such assessment to\n\n  deteriorate into seeking to persuade the judge to prefer one of two views both of which\n\n  are capable of being logically supported. It is only where a judge can be satisfied that\n\n  the body of expert opinion cannot be logically supported at all that such opinion will not\n\n  provide the benchmark by reference to which the defendant’s conduct falls to be\n\n  assessed.244.    I applied the above test not only in relation to\n\nDr Tan’s medical advice to Mr Harte (as seen earlier), but also to Dr Tan’s\n\nmedical diagnosis of Mr Harte’s varicocele condition, all aspects of his surgery and,\n\nnot forgetting the no less important area, his post-operative patient care.245.    To prove that Dr Tan was negligent in his\n\nsurgery, the plaintiff relied on the doctrine ofres ipsa loquitur.His counsel\n\nreferred me to the following passages from Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol 33:\n\nNegligence, para 664 –668:Under the doctrineres ipsa loquitur, a plaintiff establishes a\n\n  prima facie case of negligence where (1) it is not possible for him to prove precisely\n\n  what was the relevant act or omission which set in train the events leading to the\n\n  accident and (2) on the evidence as it stands at the relevant time it is more likely than\n\n  not that the effective cause of the accident was some act or omission of the defendant or\n\n  of someone for whom the defendant is responsible, which act or omission constitutes a\n\n  failure to take proper care for the plaintiff’s safety. There must be reasonable\n\n  evidence of negligence. However, when the thing which causes the accidentis shown to\n\n  be under the management of the defendantor his employees, andthe accident is such\n\n  as in the ordinary course of things does not happen if those who have the management use\n\n  proper care, if affords reasonable evidence, in the absence of explanation by the\n\n  defendant, that the accident arose from want of care...Even though the matter is not one of common experience, and where an\n\n  unexplained accident occurs from a thing under the defendant’s control, and medical\n\n  or other expert evidence shows that such accidents would not happen if proper care were\n\n  used, there is at least evidence of negligence for the court.….Where the plaintiff successfully allegesres ipsa locquiturits effect is to furnish evidence of negligence on which a court is free to find for the\n\n  plaintiff.246.    I do not think that the above maxim has any\n\napplication here. The plaintiff’s fall in the toilet unfortunately has crept into the\n\nequation and is capableper seof causing bilateral atrophy. The fall is something\n\nbeyond the management and control of the 1stdefendant. It is not for the 1stdefendant to prove that the fall caused the damage. So long he shows that there are other\n\nprobable causes (other than his surgery) for the atrophy, without proving which is in fact\n\nresponsible for the damage, the principle ofres ipsa loquiturcan no longer help\n\nthe plaintiff, who always has the legal burden to prove that Dr Tan had breached his duty\n\nof care towards him.247.    At this juncture, it bears remembering that an\n\nallegation of clinical negligence stemming from incompetence or malpractice amounts to an\n\nattack on the professional standing and reputation of a doctor. Hence, the charge of\n\nnegligence against that doctor is necessarily of a serious nature. The standard of proof\n\nrequired for matters of such gravity has been laid down by the Court of Appeal decision inHucks v Cole(1968) 112 Sol Jo 483 as follows:A charge of professional negligence against a medical man was a serious\n\n  charge, on a different footing to a charge of negligence against a motorist or an\n\n  employer. The reason is because the consequences for the professional man are far more\n\n  grave. A finding of negligence affects his standing and reputation. It impairs the\n\n  confidence which his clients have in him. The burden of proof is correspondingly greater.\n\n  The principle applies that: ‘In proportion as the charge is grave, so ought the proof\n\n  to be clear’: seeHornal v Neubergger Products Ltd[1957] 1 QB 247.Another difference lies in the fact that, with the best will in the\n\n  world, things do sometimes go amiss in surgical operations or medical treatment. A\n\n  striking illustration wasRoe v Minister of Health[1954] 2 QB 66. So a doctor is\n\n  not to be held negligent simply because something goes wrong. It is not right to invoke\n\n  against him the maximres ipsa loquitursave in an extreme case. He is not liable\n\n  for mischance or misadventure. Nor is he liable for an error of judgment. He is not liable\n\n  for choosing one course out of two which may be open to him, or for following one school\n\n  of thought rather than another. He is liable only if he falls below the standard of a\n\n  reasonably competent practitioner in his field – so much so that his conduct may\n\n  fairly be held to be – I will not say deserving of censure, but, at any rate,\n\n  inexcusable.248.    However, I think the above test laid down inHucks\n\nv Coledoes not apply to the initial fact-finding, or the proof of causal factors or\n\ncausation, which ordinarily remains on the civil test of a balance of probability in any\n\ncase. After establishing the causal factors, there is still the next step of proving the\n\nbreach of the doctor’s duty of care, which is the foundation of the charge against\n\nthe doctor for his negligence. For this next step, I believe the principle stated inHuck\n\nv Colemust be kept in view: ‘In proportion as the charge is grave, so oughtthe\n\nproof to be clear.’Therefore the fact that something has gone wrong during\n\nsurgery is notper seindicative of negligence. The mere fact of a complication\n\noccurring does not necessarily mean that the surgeon has fallen below the accepted\n\nstandard of care of a reasonably competent surgeon. The question always has to be whether\n\nthe proven facts are reasonably capable of an inference of negligence, where there is no\n\ndirect evidence of negligence.",
        "My Analysis": "249.    To begin with, it is wrong to think that both\n\ntestes of the plaintiff have been completely infarcted or are now made up of dead tissue\n\nonly. Dr Notley himself said that the biopsies done some months after the surgery showed\n\nthat parts of the testes survived. He had no doubt that other parts of the testes had also\n\nsurvived up to a point. Dr Schlegel even said that Mr Harte’s testes were probably\n\none of the best in a man who has non-obstructive azoospermia with reference to the results\n\nof the testicular biopsy done on 21 October 1998. This clearly is a case of partial\n\natrophy.(a) Infection as a cause of atrophy250.    Subclinical infection (especially if it is\n\ninside the testis) is possible as infection is always a possibility after any surgery.\n\nInfection causing testicular failure can be a contributory cause. A swollen scrotum the\n\nsize of a grapefruit can be the result of infection. But A/Prof Foo did not think that\n\ninfection could cause testicular atrophy unless it was a very bad infection, in which case\n\nthere would be pus and fever and the rest of the symptoms. Dr Jimmy Beng also concluded\n\nthat the ‘hyalinization’ found was inconsistent with an infection. With no\n\nevidence of pus and fever and with evidence of ‘hyalinization’, I can safely\n\nrule out infection as a possible cause of the atrophy.",
        "(b) Was the Scrotal approach adopted?": "251.    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Dr Tan\n\nhad essentially used the scrotal approach in his operation on Mr Harte.252.    The old-fashioned scrotal approach normally\n\ninvolved incision at the scrotum itself. Dr Notley condemned the scrotal approach as being\n\ndangerous because it produced a high incidence of testicular infarction. Those using the\n\nscrotal approach would operate and ligate at the level of the pampiniform plexus network\n\nof veins before they coalesce into the vasal veins and other sets of veins. The surgeon\n\nmight not know which were the important veins to leave behind and the minimum number that\n\nought to be left behind unligated. Thus, the vasal veins and tributaries at the\n\npampiniform plexus were likely to be divided as well. According to Dr Notley, the scrotal\n\napproach had since been abandoned because of these reasons.253.    However, Dr Notley’s explanation of the\n\ndangers of the scrotal approach did not accord with the reasons given at page 1364 of\n\n‘Campbell’s Urology’ 7thEdition where it stated that:In the early 1900s, an open scrotal approach was employed, involving\n\n  the mass ligation and excision of the varicosed plexus of veins. At the level of the\n\n  scrotum, however, the pampiniform plexus of veins is intimatelyentwined with the\n\n  coiled testicular artery. Therefore, scrotal operations are to be avoided becausedamage\n\n  to the arterial supplyof the testis frequently results in testicular atrophy and\n\n  further impairment of spermatogenesis and fertility.254.    I was thus given the wrong impression by Dr\n\nNotley that overligation of veins was the cause of the frequent incidence of atrophy in\n\nsuch scrotal operations when in fact it was the severance or damage of the arteries\n\nentwined with the veins ligated and excised at the scrotal level that led to the problem.255.    In any event, I find no evidence in this case\n\nthat Dr Tan operated at the scrotum level using this old-fashioned method. Photographs P25\n\nto 28 show the location of the incision at both sides, which were over the external\n\ninguinal ring. He did not deliver the testis out of the wound in both operations. He\n\ndelivered up part of the spermatic cord to enable him to proceed with the vein ligation\n\nand division at the level consistent with the subinguinal approach. I find no evidence\n\nthat the vein ligations and divisions were at the level of the pampiniform plexus network\n\nof veins. I believe there would be sufficient spermatic cord length above the pampiniform\n\nplexus network of veins for him to retrieve out of the skin incisions to perform the\n\nsubinguinal varicocelectomy.256.    The fact that Dr Tan ligated a total of 11 and 7\n\nveins on the right side and left side respectively does not indicate that he must have\n\nligated at the pampiniform plexus. A/Prof Li said that at the subinguinal area, one might\n\nfind on the average 15 to 20 internal veins already, and perhaps 5 or 6 external veins.\n\nThere would also be some cremasteric veins. The medical literature tendered also\n\nrecognises that there are more veins encountered with the subinguinal approach. So the\n\ntotal number of veins ligated by Dr Tan is not, in my view, inconsistent with an operation\n\nat the subinguinal level.257.    Neither were the two skin incisions too high or\n\ntoo low that it was not possible for Dr Tan to do a subinguinal surgery. Upon being shown\n\nthe photographs of the skin incisions on Mr Harte, A/Prof Li said that with those skin\n\ncuts, one would definitely be able to do a subinguinal surgery because the skin was mobile\n\nand the patient was relatively fat. The skin incision could be easily moved to the area\n\nwhere the actual operation was intended. The operation in the deeper areas of the body\n\nneed not be directly at the location where the skin incision had been made.258.    No evidence is led by the plaintiff to show that\n\nDr Tan’s skin incision at the level for Mr Harte is something that a reasonably\n\ncompetent urologist will not do for a subinguinal variocelectomy.",
        "(c) The operation": "259.    In this case, there is no clear evidence proving\n\nthat Dr Tan was negligent in his operation. As counsel for the 1stdefendant\n\nrightly pointed out, there is no concrete evidence like a swab or an instrument left\n\nbehind. The alleged negligence is based wholly on an inference that Dr Tan must have\n\nbotched up the operation because atrophy has occurred.260.    The main theory advanced by counsel for the\n\nplaintiff initially was that Dr Tan had tied up too many veins. That theory was demolished\n\nby Dr Schlegel, the plaintiff’s own witness. Dr Schlegel agreed that if Dr Tan had,\n\nat the level of the subinguinal surgery, cut 11 veins on the right side, and 7 on the\n\nleft, leaving the vasal vein intact and with no inadvertent damage to other veins or\n\narteries, then there would not be any vascular damage to the testes.261.    In fact, Dr Schlegel had in his professional\n\npapers suggested an even more aggressive varicocelectomy method where nearly all the veins\n\nexcept for the vasal veins are ligated. Dr Notley also stated that ‘modern\n\noperations designed to excise all the spermatic veins, both internal and external, and\n\neven the gubernacular veins rarely create this disastrous complication [i.e. testicular\n\ninfarction]. The crucial veins to be spared are those accompanying the vas.’\n\nSince I accept Dr Tan’s evidence that he had not ligated the vasal veins, it is thus\n\nmost unlikely that he had infarcted Mr Harte’s testicles.262.    Even if it were true that keeping just the set\n\nof vasal veins turned out to be inadequate for venous drainage in Mr Harte’s case,\n\nand the testicles consequently infarcted leading to atrophy, I still cannot regard Dr Tan\n\nas having been negligent because operating in that manner is recognised by eminent and\n\nreputable urologists such as Dr Schlegel and Dr Goldstein, including Dr Notley, as an\n\nacceptable practice. I would regard their views as representing a responsible body of\n\nprofessional opinion. I cannot see how Dr Tan could be said to have breached his duty of\n\ncare to his patient by using such a widely recognised and accepted technique. A/Prof Li\n\nalso said that the standard practice is to ligate as many veins as possible but leave the\n\nvasal veins intact. His is the view of yet another equally eminent and distinguished\n\nurologist.263.    Counsel for the plaintiff went on in his\n\nsubmission to analyse the countless ways in which Dr Tan could have misused the Babcock\n\nforceps and damaged the arteries or the vasal veins. There is also the added allegation of\n\ninsufficient optical magnification by Dr Tan, implying that he did not see very well\n\nduring his operation. As I have said before, they remain as theoretical possibilities,\n\nwhich do not carry much weight without some substantive evidence.264.    Mr Lek, counsel for the 2nddefendants, made a valiant attempt in his submission to explain the unusual, consecutive\n\nnegligence of Dr Tan for the varicocelectomy operation on each side as follows:(a)    Dr Tan made the skin incision at the same level\n\n  as Dr Dubin who used the inguinal method. As Dr Tan opted for the subinguinal approach, he\n\n  had to reach quite deep down (4 to 5 cm) in the case of the obese plaintiff in order to\n\n  reach and pull out the spermatic cord.(b)    A/Prof Li had said that it would be more\n\n  difficult to deliver up the spermatic cord for a fat man and the surgeon would have to dig\n\n  deeper to get to the cord.(c)    At times, there might not be enough cord length\n\n  to bring the whole spermatic cord up to the surface or the skin level and in that\n\n  situation the surgery would have to be done within the wound.(d)    In the process either of operating on the cord\n\n  within the wound or in attempting the difficult procedure of delivering the spermatic cord\n\n  out of the wound, he injured the testicular arteries, which led to ischaemic injury to the\n\n  testicles.265.    Mr Lek thus submitted that since Dr Tan used the\n\nsame technique on both sides, that was why testicular artery damage occurred on both sides\n\nresulting in atrophy in both testicles at the same time.266.    On closer examination of A/Prof Li’s\n\nevidence, I find that the greater difficulty of retrieval of the spermatic cord was said\n\nin the context of a fat man versus a thinner man and the depth of retrieval. He did not\n\nsay that there was real difficultyper se. On the contrary, A/Prof Li testified\n\nthat actually there is no difficulty in pushing up the testis, through the inguinal area\n\nto deliver it out of the wound as the testis is mobile and there are no muscles in the way\n\nof the delivery. It is not at all traumatic on the spermatic cord to pull the whole testis\n\nout. However, the operation takes more time. Photographs in D44 show a varicocele\n\noperation where the entire testicle with part of its spermatic cord had been delivered\n\ncompletely out of the wound. Photographs in D43 show a typical varicocele operation on the\n\nspermatic cord where the testicle was not delivered out of the wound. A/Prof Li confirmed\n\nthat there is also no difficulty pushing up the testis halfway without actually delivering\n\nthe testis, in order to expose just the part of the spermatic cord that the surgeon\n\nintends to perform his varicocelectomy. Thus, the premise of Mr Lek’s submission is\n\nnot sound.267.    Mr Lek in his cross-examination elicited from\n\nA/Prof Li numerous possibilities on how accidental testicular artery injury can occur:\n\nclamping it, tying it, twisting it, pinching it, or burning it during diathermy. A/Prof Li\n\naccepted that these are the usual risks of surgery.268.    In his submissions, Mr Lek then referred me to\n\nthe following articles to emphasize the importance of safeguarding the testicular artery,\n\ndamage of which can cause atrophy:(1)Surgery of Male Infertility by Marc Goldstein, Chapter 18 -\n\n  Varicocelectomy: General Considerations- The incidence of testicular artery injury\n\n  after inguinal varicocelectomy is unknown. Case reports, however, suggest that this\n\n  complication may be more common than realized. It can result in testicular atrophy and, if\n\n  the operation is performed bilaterally, azoospermia may ensue in a previously oligospermic\n\n  man. Furthermore, Starzl and his transplant group reported a 14 per cent incidence of\n\n  testicular atrophy and a 70 per cent incidence of testicular atrophy and a 70 percent\n\n  incidence of hydrocele formation when the spermatic cord was divided and the vas and vasal\n\n  vessels were preserved. (My Comment: In Mr Harte’s case, there was no division of the\n\n  spermatic cord, unlike the cases cited by Starzl which involved severance of the other\n\n  arteries at the time of division of the whole spermatic cord where these arteries run\n\n  alongside.)(2)Testicular Artery Ramification Within The Inguinal Canal by\n\n  Jarow, Ogle, Kaspar and Hopkins -Testicular arterial anatomy has great clinical\n\n  importance due to the application of this knowledge to testicular surgery. The capability\n\n  of collateral arterial blood supply through the deferential and cremasteric arteries to\n\n  support the testis has been used in patients who require transection of the main\n\n  testicular vessels during orchiopexy for crytorchidism. However, in some cases this\n\n  collateral blood supply does not appear to be sufficient to maintain the testis and\n\n  atrophy ensues. (My Comment: Again, this is not applicable because there is an intentional\n\n  division by transection of the testicular artery during the operation, which did not take\n\n  place in our case. Dr Tan had not cut any of the arteries during his operation.)(3)Microsurgical Inguinal Varicocelectomy with delivery of the\n\n  Testis: An Artery and Lymphatic Sparing Technique -Testicular atrophy and azoospermia\n\n  following varicocelectomy are risks associated with ligation of the testicular artery.\n\n  Preservation of the testicular artery is particularly critical when operating upon a\n\n  solitary testis, or in children and adolescents on whom the operation is being performed\n\n  prophylactically. (My Comment: This is also inapplicable because the article refers to\n\n  ligation of the testicular artery, which did not happen here.)(4)Anatomical Approach to Varicocelcctomy: Schlegel and Goldstein -Inadvertent injury to a testicular artery is easily possible with inadequate care or\n\n  optical magnification.269.    In my view, Mr Lek tried to elevate the\n\nconsequences of inadvertent injury to the testicular artery to that of adeliberate\n\nseverance (i.e. total damage)of a testicular artery as a part of the operation,\n\nwhere the risk of atrophy would naturally be higher. Mr Lek appeared to be suggesting that\n\nDr Tan accidentally damaged the testicular artery on both sides so severely that it\n\namounted to a complete severance of a testicular artery first on one side followed later\n\nby the other side because of insufficient optical magnification. To my mind, this is not\n\nonly remote but also highly speculative. Am I to believe that Dr Tan was operating almost\n\nblindfolded figuratively speaking, or he was so very heavy handed during both operations,\n\ntugging at the arteries more than he should, thereby causing severe traction injury to the\n\narteries? I do not.270.    Whilst on this point, I tend to agree with\n\nA/Prof Foo that the traction force when using the Babcock forceps to grip and pull up the\n\nspermatic cord through the skin incision is not that rough and severe to cause injury to\n\nthe artery. A/Prof Foo explained that the Babcock instrument is constructed in such a way\n\nthat it does not cause severe injury to the tissue generally unless the surgeon is very\n\nrough or heavy handed and does things without care.271.    For the purpose of analysis, let me assume the\n\nworse that Dr Tan, despite all the care taken, had accidentally damaged the testicular\n\nartery fairly severely. Impairment of blood flow would then result. But I have to remind\n\nmyself that there are three arteries (i.e. internal spermatic artery, artery of the vas\n\ndeferens and cremasteric artery) supplying blood to each testicle. According to Dr\n\nSchlegel, the testicle will survive and in fact function pretty well where there is damage\n\nto just one artery. Exhibit D 13 confirms what Dr Schlegel said. The diagram there shows\n\nthe free anastomosis between the three arteries supplying each testis. To accidentally and\n\nseverely damage all three arteries which are not co-located together at one place on each\n\ntesticle (i.e. making a total of six arteries to be damaged) to get to the disastrous\n\nstage of bilateral atrophy seems highly improbable.272.    This is also borne out by Dr Notley’s\n\nobservation that it is quite difficult to infarct the testicle because of its profuse\n\narterial supply and the profuse anastomosis.273.    Furthermore, if the arteries or the veins were\n\nligated, A/Prof Foo explained that there should not be any scrotal haematoma. I agree.\n\nA/Prof Foo’s evidence makes logical sense because in that situation, there would be\n\nno blood flowing into the organ to create any haematoma, whether intratesticular or\n\nextratesticular. Whatever theory postulated must fit the facts. When it does not as in\n\nthis case, the theory must be discarded. Since there was an intratesticular haematoma, the\n\nlikelihood of inadvertent ligation of all the arteries or arterial damage resulting in\n\ntheir complete blockage has to be ruled out.274.    The CDUS result in September 1997 showing\n\nperfusion indicated that the arteries were still functioning to some extent, as there was\n\nstill blood flow. This clearly dispels the hypothesis of inadvertent ligation or severe\n\ndamage and blockage of the arteries.",
        "(d) The operation technique used": "275.    In my judgment, the operation technique used by\n\nDr Tan cannot be faulted. The subinguinal approach is recognised and supported by a number\n\nof medical papers tendered, which I find it unnecessary to enumerate. Dr Schlegel had\n\nagreed that if Dr Tan had done what he said he did, there would be no atrophy. Dr Schlegel\n\naccepted that the procedure used by Dr Tan as described in his affidavit generally fits\n\nthe standard of care for treatment of a varicocele. Dr Schlegel did not say that the\n\noptical magnification used by Dr Tan during his surgery was insufficient or that too many\n\nveins were ligated.276.    All the experts agree that bilateral testicular\n\natrophy after varicocelectomy is unheard of. Atrophy on one side has been reported but is\n\nextremely rare.277.    There is no credible evidence produced to\n\npersuade me that Dr Tan’s surgery for this simple operation fell below the standard\n\nof care expected of any responsible and competent urologist surgeon.",
        "(e) Traction injury": "278.    Dr Tan opined that Mr Harte suffered both\n\ncontusion and traction injuries, the latter being more serious. In a varicocelectomy\n\noperation, the area of the spermatic cord cut open is mechanically weakened. When sudden\n\ntraction force is applied, the resulting damage is thus even more severe than what it\n\nwould otherwise be. See illustrations D 19, 22 and 23 by Dr Tan. His explanation for the\n\nmechanism of the traction injury was as follows:(a) The small veins external to the testicle will tear. Blood will leak\n\n  into the scrotum and cause an extratesticular or scrotal haematoma and not an\n\n  intratesticular haematoma. The rate of scrotal swelling depends on the size and number of\n\n  veins damaged. The swelling may take up to a day in Mr Harte’s case to be noticeable.\n\n  A/Prof Foo also believes that traction injury will only cause an extratesticular\n\n  haematoma.(b) Although arteries are mechanically stronger than veins,\n\n  nevertheless excessive stretching can still tear the fragile inner wall lining of the\n\n  arteries. The tearing causes spasm and contraction of the artery. Blood clots build up at\n\n  the tear region, narrowing the arteries. Eventually that leads to thrombosis at the choke\n\n  points. As blood flow slows down, the testes become ischaemic. If the blood supply is\n\n  completely cut off, the testicle will devascularise but it will not lead to any swelling\n\n  or intratesticular haematoma.279.    However, Dr Notley had not heard of a traction\n\ninjury. He had not seen one. He did not think that it was recorded in the medical\n\nliterature.280.    Dr Schlegel too had not come across a traction\n\ninjury to the spermatic cord vessels during a varicocele surgery. In his opinion, as long\n\nas the muscles were around the spermatic cord, using the Babcock forceps to pull out the\n\nspermatic cord was not likely to cause enough injury to the blood vessels to damage them.\n\nAfter the blood vessels were separated from the muscles, then the exposed vessels would\n\nbecome vulnerable to avulsion or traction injuries.281.    A/Prof Foo also said that he was not aware of\n\nanything in the medical literature that supported a proposition that a traction injury to\n\nthe spermatic cord would lead to eventual testicular atrophy. A/Prof Foo explained that an\n\nintratesticular haematoma caused by crushing of the testicles might be aggravated by\n\ntraction injury to the arteries, which could at the same time compromise the blood supply\n\nto the testicles. Thus, the traction injury could contribute to the atrophy of the testes.\n\nHowever, in his opinion, the crushing injury was a more significant contributory than the\n\ntraction injury.282.    A/Prof Li felt that one would need to pull\n\nextremely hard on the testes before there could be any traction injury to the spermatic\n\ncord. Not having come across this, he did not appear enamoured by this possibility. I\n\nshare his sentiments.283.    Based on the opinions of the experts, I come to\n\nthe conclusion that traction injury is not likely to cause any rupture of the capillary\n\nvessels within the testicular tissue and hence, internal intratesticular haemorrhage from\n\ntraction injury is improbable. With continuous stretching according to A/Prof Foo, the\n\ninternal spermatic fascia will be the first to give way, followed by the veins and\n\nlymphatics, then the arteries, the vas deferens and lastly the nerves (which are all\n\nwithin the spermatic cord). This shows that the arteries are much stronger than the\n\ninternal spermatic fascia, veins and lymphatics. Hence, it is not likely for the arteries\n\nto give way so readily.284.    It is of course possible that a very large\n\ntraction force can still sever or damage all 3 arteries to the testes on each side to\n\ncause bilateral atrophy through devascularisation. But I think that possibility is remote.\n\nThe blood flowing outunder pressurefrom the ruptured arteries will quickly\n\ndistend the scrotum extratesticularly, thereby creating a big haematoma, which with time\n\nmust cause some discolouration on his swollen scrotum. Mr Harte should perhaps be having a\n\nfairly dark coloured bluish black or reddish purplish scrotum with significant swelling by\n\nthe time he left the hospital. But these were not the symptoms observed. There was no\n\nsignificant discolouration and/or swelling to move Mr Harte to raise an alarm before his\n\ndischarge at 7.00 p.m. Neither was there evidence that the internal spermatic fascia was\n\nripped or that the lymphatics were torn resulting in a substantial hydrocele formation. I\n\nthus rule out traction injury to the arteries as a cause of the devascularisation of the\n\ntestes.(f) Contusion injury285.    The plaintiff’s main contentions against\n\nthe contusion theory were:(a)    the absence of abrasion and bruising of the\n\n  scrotal skin and penis;(b)    the absence of pain and swelling before discharge\n\n  from the hospital;(c)    the absence of a black coloured scrotum;(d)    the presence of a bright red swollen scrotum\n\n  turning to a reddish purplish colour on the morning after the fall;(e)    the extraordinary force needed to contuse the\n\n  testes before one can get bilateral testicular atrophy.286.    Before dealing with the above contentions, I\n\nwill closely examine how the mechanism of contusion can result in pain, scrotal swelling,\n\nintratesticular haematoma and finally atrophy.i. Intratesticular haematoma and atrophy287.    With his schematic diagrams D18, D20 and D21, Dr\n\nTan illustrated how the contusion injury could have occurred.288.    Dr Tan testified that contusion injury without\n\nrupture of testicles would lead to oedema (a condition characterized by an excess of\n\nwatery fluid collecting in the cavities or tissues of the body), and also internal\n\nhaemorrhage of the small capillary vessels within the testes. The accumulation of bleeding\n\nfrom the capillary vessels causes swelling, expansion and rise in pressure. An\n\nintratesticular haematoma forms within the tunica albuginea, which results in raised\n\nintratesticular pressure thereby shutting off the microcirculation. See illustrations D 9\n\nand D 15 by Dr Tan. The rate at which oedema and swelling occur depends on how severe the\n\ncontusion injury is and on how rapidly the blood flows into the testicles. I agree.289.    The post-operative ultrasound scan of the\n\ntesticles showed micro-calcifications and a patchy appearance, which were not present\n\nbefore and could be due to the intratesticular haemorrhage or intratesticular haematoma.\n\nThe presence of perfusion suggested that the arterial supply to the testes was not\n\ncompromised.290.    A/Prof Foo was referred to an article:Blunt\n\nScrotal Trauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management by Munter and Faleski.\n\nHe was asked whether he would agree with the fact that a contusion without a testicular\n\nrupture seldom leads to morbidity. A/Prof Foo said that there were various degrees of\n\ncontusion from mild to severe. But a mild one alone would not cause significant damage to\n\nthe testes but a severe one combined with other factors would. He emphasized that in\n\nmedicine one usually faces multiple causes and effects contributing to a final result.\n\nThere is not just one factor to explain a phenomenon. I have to agree wholeheartedly. In\n\nhis opinion, the severe contusion had contributed to the testicular atrophy.291.    A/Prof Foo testified that compressing a taut\n\ntestis due to venous congestion or pressure buildup after the varicocele surgery would\n\ncause more damage. Intratesticular haematoma can also result from pressure damage to the\n\ntesticular tissue within the testis itself.292.    In my opinion, the fact that the testicles\n\nbecame more congested after the operation due to the ligation of several varicocele veins\n\nwas certainly a contributory factor. I fully agree that squeezing a congested taut\n\ntesticle as opposed to an uncongested one is much more likely to cause internal\n\nmicrovascular and microstructural damage to the testicular tissue and capillary blood\n\nvessels. It is nothing more than pure common sense.293.    Apart from such direct microvascular and\n\nmicrostructural testicular tissue damage due to contusion, I am of the opinion that\n\nsubsequent development of a significant haematoma, particularly an intratesticular\n\nhaematoma, can also lead to atrophy due to the buildup of pressure that may compress the\n\nveins to an extent that the venous outflow of the testes becomes seriously impaired, and\n\ncorrespondingly the venous inflow too. I find support for this in P29: Clinical Negligence\n\nby Powers and Harris 3rdEdn at para 41.98 at p 1388.ii. Pain294.    I generally accept the following explanation by\n\nA/Prof Foo on the mechanism of pain and the pain symptoms resulting from intratesticular\n\nhaemorrhage:A: …let’s assume that …bleeding starts in the testes but\n\n  the bleeding is slow, you know, it accumulates slowly and at that point in time, within a\n\n  few hours, they may not have any severe pain but only subsequently, it can cause serious\n\n  damage to the testicles. It’s the same in the head. We have seen patients with head\n\n  injury, just a knock and then they fainted, so call, and then when they get up, they look\n\n  very well. But sometimes they go to the A & E, they still look well but when they were\n\n  sent home, you know, he can become unconscious and can even die from that because at the\n\n  point of impact, bleeding occurs inside. But when the bleeding is minimal, it will not\n\n  cause pressure on the brain but after a few hours, when it caused more pressure, patient\n\n  becomes unconscious. It is a similar analogy in the testicles which the tissues inside\n\n  cannot expand. So, initially, we might think that it is a minor injury. Even, you know,\n\n  after a few days, it may not be detected. But only when it starts to manifest, you know,\n\n  when patient becomes unconscious, then a scan or what may suspect there is intra-cranial\n\n  haematoma. And it needs urgent operation to drain the haematoma to save the brain;\n\n  similarly to the testes.His Honour: So are you saying that the pain comes along when the tunica\n\n  is stretched?Witness: Yes, so initially there may not—His Honour: So if it is not stretched ---Witness: ---be much pain.His Honour: --but there is bleeding?Witness: Yes, if there is bleeding, it may not have much pain at that\n\n  time.His Honour: It may not have pain. So the nerve detects the stretching,\n\n  is it, or what?Witness: The nerve may—His Honour: How does the nerve mechanism and the pain mechanism work?Witness: The stretched nerve may numb the part a bit. So at the point\n\n  of impact, he may not have the pain and subsequently, the pain may be due to stretching of\n\n  the tunica covering the testicle. But this will take a few hours to develop. So when the\n\n  patient goes home at that time, you know, the increased pressure in the testes may not be\n\n  that great to cause him a lot of pain. But, as he himself said, after he went home, he\n\n  started to develop more and more pain, and tried to contact Dr Tan and Dr Tan somehow he\n\n  doesn’t get the message and—this can explain the whole theory.Q: Doctor, this—what you’ve just described, is it consistent\n\n  with the traction or contusion injury?A: As I said, both, you see. The traction injury will injure the\n\n  lymphatics, the veins, and possibly the artery and then the nerves. And that will explain\n\n  the extratesticular haematoma. And that may explain why at the point of impact, you know,\n\n  because of the nerve is injured, he may not feel severe pain at the point of impact. Now,\n\n  the contusion injury within the testicle will not cause pain initially but it will cause\n\n  pain subsequently, after he goes home. As the pressure builds up within the testicle, he\n\n  will feel the pain.295.    A/Prof Foo agreed that pain generally increases\n\nwith the size of the testicular swelling. But if the patient has continuous pain, the\n\npatient may become desensitised to it after a while. The nerves become slightly numb. The\n\npain felt may be less but this varies from patient to patient.296.    I reiterate that the pain arising from moderate\n\ncontusion may well be confused with the dull pain from the normal congestion that Mr Harte\n\nexperienced in his previous varicocelectomy operation. The pain from the surgery itself\n\nmay mask the pain arising from microvascular damage due to contusion. For all the reasons\n\ngiven earlier, I do not believe that Mr Harte could readily distinguish between them. I am\n\ntherefore not surprised that he did not complain of any pain, although he experienced some\n\nswelling, discomfort and dull pain in his scrotum when he was leaving the hospital.",
        "iii. Swelling – extratesticular and intratesticular": "297.    A/Prof Foo testified that if only one of the\n\nthree arteries to the testis was ligated or one artery was damaged, the swelling would\n\ntake longer to develop. Should there be a complete shutdown of blood supply due to\n\nligation of all arteries, atrophy would occur but there would not be any swelling because\n\nthere could never be any venous congestion without blood inflow.298.    However, if the veins leaving the testes were\n\ntied up instead, there would be venous congestion causing increased pressure and swelling\n\nin the testes. Should the tunica be stretched to its maximum, no more blood would ever\n\nflow in. This would similarly cause atrophy due to shutting down of the blood supply.\n\nTherefore, the rate of intratesticular swelling depends on the number of veins and/or\n\narteries ligated.299.    As for extratesticular (i.e. scrotal) swelling,\n\nA/Prof Foo alluded to this other possibility of blood and fluid collecting in the\n\nextratesticular region. He explained the source of this blood and fluid as follows:Witness: From the---if there is traction injury, the bleeding, that is,\n\n  the lymphatic will be torn, the vein will be torn, and the bleeding from the traction\n\n  injury damaging the lymphatic and vein will leak around the testicle. The crushing injury\n\n  will cause bleeding inside the testicle, so you can expect both extratesticular haematoma\n\n  as well as intratesticular haematoma.300.    A/Prof Foo agreed that swelling could also\n\nresult from an infarcted testicle, howsoever caused (for instance by devascularisation,\n\nvenous congestion, blunt trauma or torsion):Q: .. Doctor, if a testicle is infarcted, OK, would there be swelling?A: Depends on the time sequence. Initially, there may be swelling but\n\n  subsequently, you know, after a few weeks, a few months, it becomes in fact atrophied,\n\n  becomes smaller.Q: I see. So initially swelling, but after a few months, few weeks, it\n\n  becomes smaller.A: Yes.Q: As the swelling grows, would there be pain?A: Yes, your Honour.Q: And this pain would increase until the swelling reached its peak?A: Generally speaking, if the patient does not sort of get used to the\n\n  pain, sometimes after a period you become refractory to the pain,…..301.    Dr Notley gave a comprehensive account of how\n\nphysical damage can be caused within the testes from compression of the testicles with\n\nsufficient force to produce atrophy in the longer term. He said that the blood vessels in\n\nthe scrotum are numerous and profuse and will be damaged in just the same way as the\n\nvessels within the testis. The vessels will be contused and probably torn and split. The\n\nonly way the injury can produce testicular atrophy is by disruption of the blood vessels.\n\nThe capillaries, arterials and venials haemorrhage because the testicle itself is crushed\n\nand so the vessels are broken, disrupted, torn, split or pulled apart. These are\n\nmicroscopic blood vessels. They are very fine and very delicate. If the testicle is\n\ndistorted to pass through a small gap, those vessels are going to be subjected to shearing\n\nforces, which are going to tear them, pull them and break them. So as they bleed, one gets\n\nan intratesticular haematoma. I agree thus far with Dr Notley.302.    The scrotal skin also suffers from the same\n\npressure. The ‘very profuse subcutaneous vascular plexus in the scrotum’ cannot\n\nescape damage as well, and the patient will then have an external as well as an internal\n\nhaematoma. Dr Notley explained that extremely small damage to blood vessels within the\n\nscrotum could produce a spectacular haematoma. He said:Witness: ..I mean, it’s just not a reasonable assumption to say\n\n  that you can have sufficient force supplied to the testicle to disrupt the testicle and it\n\n  will not damage the testicular vessels. You only need …anextremely small\n\n  damageto blood vessels within the scrotumto produce a spectacular\n\n  haematoma. I know this from long experience, I do vasectomies through very small\n\n  incisions, perhaps, half-centimetre incisions, and I’ve, from time to time, produced\n\n  extremely major scrotal haematoma. So, you don’t need very much. It spreads.\n\n  ……. if I do the same sort of injury to a blood vessel in the scrotum, quite a\n\n  small one, because it is free and elastic and floats in the breeze, a small bleed will not\n\n  be confined ….It would tend to spread round the scrotum. So you will get a\n\n  decent-size haematoma even with quite a small local injury. So I can’t accept that\n\n  you can pass a gentleman’s testicles, ..whole scrotum, through a pair of rollers or a\n\n  roller and a smooth rock, which is only 15 millimetres … apart , and sufficient to\n\n  create a crush injury, a compression injury to the testicle, which I agree it’s a\n\n  rather special case, but I cannot accept that it would not damage the scrotal tissue\n\n  sufficiently to produce a haematoma of some size or other which somebody would see, and\n\n  that would happen, that’s, haematoma will become visible within five or six hours, in\n\n  my contention. I just do not believe you can do that sufficient to crush a testicle and\n\n  not get a scrotal haematoma. It is inconsistent, to my knowledge of anatomy.303.    Therefore, it is not surprising at all if a\n\ncontusion results in a large scrotal or extratesticular haematoma. In fact, that is\n\nusually an expected consequence of contusion. I can readily understand that. But I wanted\n\nto find a credible and reliable explanation for the large extratesticular haematoma if the\n\ncause was wholly surgical in nature. That was where I became most curious. So I asked Dr\n\nNotley to explain what one could expect to see when there was purely venous congestion of\n\nthe testicles (assuming an overligation by Dr Tan during his operation) but with no\n\nphysical injury sustained to the scrotum and testes (during the fall). Why was it that Mr\n\nHarte could develop such a spectacular swollen scrotum? It was most puzzling.304.    Based on the all the evidence before me, it\n\nbecame fairly clear that a large extratesticular or scrotal haematoma would not happenper\n\nsefrom the ligation or overligation and division of the veins or surgical damage to\n\nthe arteries resulting in a shut down of the blood flow to the testes. That seemed to rule\n\nout the plaintiff’s theory. If so, what reasonable biological explanation could there\n\nbe for Mr Harte’s large scrotal or extratesticular swelling, if indeed the plaintiff\n\nwas right that there was no contusion injury after all.305.    Then Dr Notley explained:Witness: Well, if I may explain? The testicle swells but it probably\n\n  doesn’t swell to more than about twice its normal size because of the tight tunica\n\n  albuginea. You know, that’s what I think we all agree. But, by then, the scrotum has\n\n  within it an acutely congested, abnormal, inflamed, angry, bad, dying testicle. The body\n\n  reacts to any tissue like that by producing the classical inflammatory reaction which is\n\n  the body’s response to any injury, be it bacteria, be it viral, be it trauma, burns,\n\n  hit it with a hammer, scrape it with a piece of barbed wire. The blood vessels locally\n\n  will dilate, the capillaries, you remember the little tiny tubes that we have between the\n\n  end of the arteries and before the veins, where all the activity in the tissues takes\n\n  place, where all the chemical activity, the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxides takes\n\n  place, they become permeable as a result of the inflammatory reaction being produced by\n\n  some hormones, which I'm afraid I cannot remember the name of, but they become permeable\n\n  so that the fluid content of the blood leaks out into the tissues, that’s the\n\n  lymphatic fluid, but greatly exaggerated by the increased permeability of the capillaries.\n\n  There is the, at the same time as this, a great increase in the blood supply coming into\n\n  this as a result of the inflammatory response. So you get swelling as a result of the\n\n  exudation that is going on, as part of the body’s normal reaction to a piece of dead\n\n  tissue within it. You get swelling due to the increase of blood flow through it, and\n\n  because there’s an increase in blood flow, you get an increase in heat of the area,\n\n  so you feel hot. You also get an increase in the red colouration because it is oxygenated\n\n  blood that is being passed through these dilated vessels.His Honour: But the tunica, isn’t it a fairly impermeable layer?Witness: But we’re not talking about the tunica albuginea.…..His Honour: But I’m concerned with how this swelling is spreading\n\n  to the other parts, you know, the mechanism of itWitness: But it is the reaction of the scrotum to this happening within\n\n  it, because within it is a testicle that has been injured, has swollen to twice the size,\n\n  the tunica albuginea will, to a certain extent, be involved in the inflammatory change of\n\n  –His Honour: You mean that would also swell? That would also be\n\n  inflamed?Witness: Yes, this will be thickened and exudate will form upon it as a\n\n  result of the infarction, and this is what the scrotum itself will react to. So the chap\n\n  will end up with a big red scrotum after twelve hours or so, which is acutely painful and\n\n  tender to touch. ….After all, the tunica albuginea has all the blood vessels to the\n\n  testicle passing through it. So it is, as it were, like---it’s more like a pin\n\n  cushion, isn’t it, with lots of little holes in it where the blood, the arteries go\n\n  in, the veins come out, so it’s not an impermeable sheet like a polyethylene or\n\n  damp-proof membrane you might care to put in your cellar to keep the water out. It’s\n\n  not like that at all. It’s completely permeable to these things. And, particularly,\n\n  if the blood vessels have been damaged and congested, you will have an exudation coming\n\n  out into the scrotum which will produce thislocal inflammatory reaction.His Honour: So that causes the extratesticular swelling?Witness:That causes the extratesticular swelling, the big\n\n  scrotum.His Honour: All right.Witness:So the chap, the next morning, will have a big red, hot,\n\n  painful, scrotum.305.    Thus Dr Notley came up with this very attractive\n\nproposition that the resulting testicular infarction from devascularisation led to a\n\nsevere inflammation in the morning. So Mr Harte would wake up finding himself with a big,\n\nred, hot, swollen scrotum. Dr Notley thus attributed the large red scrotal swellingpurelyto the inflammation, the cardinal signs of which would manifest within some hours of the\n\ninfarction and progress over the next six to twelve hours. In its acute form, inflammation\n\nwould be characterised by classical signs of pain (dolor), heat (calor),\n\nredness (rubor), swelling (tumor) and loss of function (function laesa).\n\nThis reactive scrotal swelling with pain and reddening would increase the size of the\n\nscrotal swelling progressively over the next 24 hours or so. By then Mr Harte would have a\n\nfirm, enlarged, red and painful scrotal swelling which would be tender to touch.306.    I have great difficulty accepting that the\n\nbody’s reaction to and rejection of a dead pair of testes alone can produce such a\n\nlarge scrotal swelling withoutan extremely severeinflammation, with\n\ninfection and pus, and perhaps also accompanying fever of some sort from that infection,\n\nwhich Mr Harte never had. Further, I find it exceptional that just overnight, the testes\n\nwould have died so rapidly, and the body would have reacted so violently and so quickly to\n\nthe dead testes, that in just less than about 20 hours, Mr Harte would have developed a\n\nred, hot, very swollen, tender and inflamed scrotum adversely reacting to and rejecting\n\nthe pair of dead testes within.307.    Although I do accept Dr Notley’s\n\nexplanation (which has also been confirmed by other expert witnesses) that a very large\n\nswelling in the nature of a scrotal haematoma can readily form from a minor haemorrhage of\n\na small blood vessel, nevertheless I think it is quite unlikely for reactionary\n\ninflammation alone from a pair of infarcted dead testicles to produce a large swelling the\n\nsize of a mango so quickly (without the aid of a haemorrhaging blood vessel of some kind).308.    There is no evidence of him complaining of a\n\nred, hot, swollen and inflamed scrotum. All the evidence I have is a bright red scrotum\n\nturning later into a reddish purplish colour, according to Mrs Harte. I also have the\n\nevidence of Mr Harte that he had a painful scrotum. However, he did not say that his red\n\nand hot scrotum was also tender to the touch, typically expected of badly inflamed or even\n\nseptic scrotum. Why should an inflamed bright red scrotum turn to a deeper reddish\n\npurplish colour, and after some 4 days later become a little bluish in colour as observed\n\nby Dr Tan, which is most incomprehensible and totally inconsistent with a bad reactionary\n\ninflammation. I find somehow that a deeper reddish purplish colour, changing to a bluish\n\ncolour is more consistent with the appearance of an extratesticular/scrotal haematoma than\n\na severe reactionary inflammation. Further, the absence of tenderness to touch typically\n\nreflects more of a haematoma than a septic and reactionary inflammation.309.    If it was indeed a reactionary inflammation, it\n\nis inconceivable that Mr and Mrs Harte should consider applying ice on his scrotum.\n\nApplying ice is more consistent with an attempt to reduce swelling from a haematoma than\n\nan inflammatory reaction in the scrotum against a pair of dead testes.310.    Mrs Harte’s evidence was that her husband\n\nwas in pain when Dr Tan prodded his scrotum area. After examining him, Dr Tan said that if\n\nthe swelling did not go away, then he would have to draw blood from his scrotum. Dr Tan\n\nexplained to them that Mr Harte most likely suffered from a scrotal haematoma. Dr Tan\n\ninformed her that there was a blood clot and her impression was that the swelling was due\n\nto this. Again, there was nothing discussed about any severe reactionary inflammation.311.    The symptoms and evidence in my view do not fit\n\nDr Notley’s postulation that the entire reddish swollen scrotum the morning after the\n\nsurgery waspurelythe result of a reactive scrotal inflammation. I cannot\n\nrule out that there may besomeinflammation giving the reddish colour.\n\nPhysical injury may also give rise to inflammation. Blood from ruptured capillary vessels\n\nslowly permeating to the tissues near the skin can also make the scrotum look\n\n‘reddish’. A taut scrotal skin may enhance the colouration. In fact, the\n\nsubsequent change to a darker purplish red or reddish purplish colour indicates the\n\npresence of some scrotal haemorrhage. The tinge of blue colour observed by Dr Tan confirms\n\nthis.312.    Dr Tan’s contemporaneous notes of a ‘scrotal\n\nhaematoma’, and the fact that he told Mrs Harte of the presence of ‘dried\n\nblood’in his scrotum reinforce my opinion that there was in fact some\n\nextratesticular haemorrhage, which points towards the existence of a contusion injury. I\n\nshall be examining the evidence of an extratesticular hematoma in more detail later. For\n\nthe moment, it suffices to state my view that the extratesticular haemorrhage with the red\n\nblood slowly permeating to the outer layers of the scrotum, and the inflammation arisingfrom the contusion injury itself, additionally coupled perhaps with some minor\n\ninflammatory reaction at that stage to the gradually dying testes (damaged by a contusion\n\nprocess as explained earlier) constitute some of the multiple factors swelling Mr\n\nHarte’s scrotum to the size of a mango, and colouring it bright red on the morning\n\nafter the surgery.313.    An intratesticular haematoma (withoutan accompanying extratesticular haematoma) will obviously not result in a black or\n\nblue-black or dark reddish purplish coloured scrotum. I doubt very much that the colour of\n\nthe haematoma within the testes can be seen through the scrotal skin. I reject Dr\n\nNotley’s evidence of ‘black testicles shinning deeply within the scrotum’\n\nto explain the ‘tinge of blue’ colour noted by Dr Tan when he examined Mr Harte\n\non the fourth day. As the scrotal wall consists of 5 layers, I find it extremely difficult\n\nto accept that the dark coloured infarcted testes can be seen through all these layers to\n\ngive it a tinge of blue colour.314.    In my opinion, the discolouration of the scrotum\n\nand the changes in colour seen by Mrs Harte and Dr Tan are likely to be associated with\n\nprimarily an extratesticular haematoma and secondarily with some inflammation at the same\n\ntime. I reject Dr Notley’s evidence that the discolouration seen on the scrotal skin\n\ncan possibly reflect the colour of the infarcted and dead pair of black testes. For the\n\nreasons given earlier, I also reject the contention that all contusion injury and\n\nresulting extratesticular haematomas, regardless of severity, must necessarily lead to a\n\nblack coloured scrotum.iv. Extraordinary force not needed315.    The plaintiff’s experts relied heavily on\n\nthe supposition that extraordinary force was needed before any blunt trauma to the\n\ntesticles could occur. Dr Schlegel kept referring to the paper \"Bilateral\n\nTesticular Atrophy Following Blunt Trauma\" by MacDermott and Gray of the\n\nDepartment of Urology, Royal Infirmary, Bradford to demonstrate that a scrotal haematoma\n\nand bilateral testicular atrophy could only result when the impact forces reached the\n\norder of magnitude of a car falling with its wheels landing on the testicles. To my mind,\n\nit is a gross exaggeration to say that the forces must reach such proportions before they\n\ncan cause testicular contusion and bilateral atrophy.316.    In fact, I find that the comment of the authors\n\nof that article to be most interesting:In this case, there wasneither rupture of the tunica albuginea\n\n  nor disruption of the macroscopic blood supply of either testis; indeed the testes\n\n  appeared completely viable at operation.The testes and scrotum were, however,\n\n  caught under the revolving car wheel and subjected to acompressive force.\n\n  This would have been sufficient to causemicrovascular damage to the testicular\n\n  tissue leading to atrophy. This case again illustrates theimportance of\n\n  microstructural damage in testicular trauma.317.    The doctors there concluded that both testes\n\nwere viable after the accident because the tunica albuginea had not been breached and\n\nfresh bleeding was obtained through a short incision made in the tunica albuginea. Yet at\n\nthe review 5 months later, both testes were found to have atrophied to pea-sized nodules.Microvasculardamage andmicrostructuraldamage from trauma had led to the bilateral testicular\n\natrophy. This shows how delicate the testes can be since damage at the microlevel can\n\nstill lead to devastating results. I do not believe at all that extraordinary force is\n\nnecessary in every case having regard to the fact that damage at the microlevel is already\n\nsufficient, given time, to produce testicular atrophy as that case demonstrates.318.    This supposition that maximum force is needed to\n\ncause testicular atrophy is debunked by Dr Tay Kah Phuan, a urologist practising at the\n\nGleneagles Medical Centre and having his own private clinic called K P Tay Urology. He\n\ntestified that ‘very minimal trauma when applied very wrongly can result in very\n\nmaximal injury’ citing a recent case he treated. He accepted, quite rightly, that as\n\na general rule, a minimal force would not cause a severe injury but one must never\n\ndiscount that a minimal force could also cause a maximal injury. This comment is with\n\nreference to the delicate tissues in the scrotum including the testes.319.    The brief facts of that recent case are as\n\nfollows:(a) A 15 year old Indian boy was accidentally kicked on 7 June 2000 in\n\n  the groin by his younger 13 year old brother whilst they were both asleep together on the\n\n  bed. The boy woke up and noted that he was kicked. His younger brother was still asleep\n\n  and unaware that he had kicked his older brother in the groin. The older boy went back to\n\n  sleep again. In Dr Tay’s opinion, a sleeping 13 year old boy obviously could not have\n\n  kicked very hard.(b) On waking up the following morning, 8 June 2000, the boy had some\n\n  pain and some minimal swelling. The pain was not sufficient for him to complain to anyone\n\n  yet.(c) The swelling progressed. As the swelling increased, the pain\n\n  increased. He also developed a low-grade fever. The father brought him to Dr Ravi, who\n\n  brought the boy and his father to consult Dr Tay just before midnight on 9 June 2000.(d) Dr Tay examined him on 10 June 2000 (i.e. past midnight and in the\n\n  early hours of the morning). The boy had some discomfort at the lower part of his abdomen.\n\n  Dr Tay found that his scrotum and penis were swollen. His testes were not palpable on both\n\n  sides. He had a scrotal haematoma the size of a small orange and it was ‘dusky\n\n  blue-black’ in colour. This meant that there was a blood clot.(e) Ultrasound revealed a normal right testis and a left\n\n  intratesticular haematoma with possible left testicular rupture.(f) He was operated on immediately at 0140 hours on 10 June 2000.\n\n  Operative findings revealed a large scrotal haematoma as well as a haematoma on the left\n\n  testis and epididymis with near rupture because of the swelling and the trauma, and\n\n  haemorrhagic infarction of the left testis, epididymis and spermatic cord. He also had a\n\n  haemorrhagic hydrocele. It was a collection of bloodstained fluid in the area outside the\n\n  testis. His left testis was removed. The tunica was not ruptured.(g) Histology report stated that there was reddish-black discolouration\n\n  throughout the tissue of the testis. There was extensive congestion. Sections of the\n\n  testis and epididymis under microscopic examination confirmed the presence of extensive\n\n  haemorrhagic infarction consistent with the effects of haematoma induced by trauma.(h) Dr Tay said that in blunt trauma like this, one would not usually\n\n  see injury on the skin unless it were to be so extensive as to rupture the skin.320.    Dr Tay drew attention to the histology report\n\nwhich revealed that‘a few viable seminiferous tubules [were] seen focally,\n\nshowing normal spermatogenesis’despite the extensive damage to the boy’s\n\ntestis. The fever was reactionary and in response to inflammation. There was extensive\n\ninflammation. To all intents and purposes, the left testis was dead and he had to remove\n\nit. According to Dr Tay, tissue death must occur first before atrophy can set in. After\n\nthe tissue dies, it undergoes fibrosis and scarring. Thereafter, it slowly shrinks with\n\ntime.321.    He said that the boy would have some initial\n\npain which woke him up but the painwas not severe enoughto interrupt his sleep or\n\nfor him to beat up his brother so to speak. But on the following day, the boy notedincreasing\n\npain which progressed. It progressed until the following day when he actually went to\n\ntell his father that he was kicked. The pain symptoms from the trauma to the boy’s\n\nscrotum were remarkably similar to Mr Harte’s.322.    In Dr Tay’s opinion, it was highly unlikely\n\nthat he could have saved the testis even if the boy had come to see him as early as 2\n\nhours after the accident. If it was tissue death because of a crushing injury, it would\n\ntake time for the tissue to die, but it would die. In his view, there was nothing much\n\nthat the doctor could do. Unlike torsion injury interrupting the blood supply, the surgery\n\nto untwist the testis to restore the blood supply should be done within 6 hours in order\n\nto save it.323.    Dr Tay also gave an instance of another patient\n\nwith much delayed scrotal swelling and pain after trauma. This was a cyclist wearing tight\n\nlycra pants. When he pulled the bottom of the pants to urinate, his lycra pants slipped\n\nand snapped back, hitting his right testis. He had very little pain and could cycle home.\n\nHe noticed pain on his right testis only at night, followed by swelling in the testis a\n\nday later. The pain and swelling subsided but recurred 2 days before seeing Dr Tay. When\n\nDr Tay examined him a week after the accident, his testis was swollen to nearly double its\n\nsize. The right epididymis was thickened and very tender. There was a small hydrocele, a\n\ncollection of fluid in the testis. The skin was perfectly fine with no scrotal haematoma.\n\nThe ultrasound report revealed a ‘right-sided epididymitis’ (meaning\n\ninflammation of the right epididymis with evidence of ‘marked hyperaemic\n\nchanges’) and ‘mild orchitis’ (meaning infection of the testis). This was a\n\nrelatively minor trauma according to Dr Tay. It was fortunate that he did not lose his\n\ntestis nor suffer atrophy.324.    Another interesting example given by Dr Tay was\n\na case he treated many years ago, where a Thai worker had swelling of his testes. There\n\nwas no history of trauma that he could tell Dr Tay. He had infection of the testes and\n\ninfection of the epididymis. He had spiking fever that went up and down. He was given\n\ninjections and antibiotics. About 5 days or a week later, the testes actually eroded\n\nthrough the scrotum and discharged pus. This anecdote is important, as we shall see later,\n\nas it helps to establish if it was only the intratesticular haematoma plus very severe\n\nreactionary inflammation (without any accompanying scrotal or extratesticular haematoma)\n\nthat caused the scrotum to swell to the size it was on the morning after and to continue\n\nto swell to the size of a mango by the 4thday. To my mind, that inflammation\n\nmust be extremely severe for the reactionary swelling to be the main contributory of the\n\nmango sized scrotum.325.    I am inclined to believe that it was the\n\nintratesticular haematoma, plus the extratesticular haematoma plus some degree of\n\ninflammation, which together caused the extensive swelling seen in Mr Harte’s\n\nscrotum. One has to bear in mind that the plaintiff never had any fever, which would\n\nnaturally be expected for a serious reactionary inflammation. Dr Tay had explained very\n\nsuccinctly that traumaper sewould not cause infection. Traumaper secauses inflammation. With an inflamed tissue, there is going to be swelling in that\n\ntissue. Then it can become secondarily infected but it will take some time. In the case of\n\nthe Indian boy for instance, trauma remains as the primary injury although there can be\n\nsecondary reactive inflammation with associated fever.326.    I admitted such anecdotal evidence under s 48 of\n\nthe Evidence Act, being evidence which might be consistent or inconsistent with the\n\nopinion of the different medical experts including Dr Tay himself in relation to the rate\n\nof swelling, degree of pain felt, severity of the trauma and the extent of testicular\n\ndamage. Just as with the other case studies cited in the medical literature admitted into\n\ncourt, these first hand case studies of Dr Tay are relevant evidence.327.    Dr Myint Soe referred me toC v Creported in Butterworths: Personal Injury Litigation Service (Issue 31) where a tanker\n\ndriver used a toilet with a defective seat. The seat came loose, trapping his left\n\ntesticle. Later, his left testicle had to be removed. Again, this shows that the force\n\nneeded to cause severe injury need not be very large.328.    When the example of the Indian boy was put to\n\nProf Schlegel, he attributed the damage to ‘torsion’ of the testicle, which he\n\nsaid commonly occurs in young boys. He said that it was not pathologically possible to\n\ntell the difference between torsion and trauma and the results were equally consistent\n\nwith both.329.    Based on the totality of the evidence, I think\n\nthat the infarction in that Indian boy’s left testicle was due to trauma and not\n\ntorsion. There was no sharp pain felt during the night because the boy fell asleep after\n\nthe kick. A sharp pain is normally associated with torsion injury. Dr Tay, who examined\n\nthe boy and operated on him to remove the dead testicle, never diagnosed a torsion injury\n\nafter considering the history related by the patient, the ultrasound report, his operative\n\nfindings and the histology report. His conclusion was affirmatively that of trauma to the\n\ntesticle due to the kick. Without any question, this case clearly shows how delicate the\n\ntestes really are.v. Evidence of a Scrotal Haematoma330.    I do not consider the absence of a black\n\ncoloured scrotum to be evidence fatal to Dr Tan’s postulation of a contusion injury\n\nsufficiently severe to cause atrophy. Mr Harte’s reddish purplish scrotum (as\n\ndescribed by Mrs Harte), depicting a dark coloured scrotum, might well show up by the\n\nfourth day as a tinge of blue as described by Dr Tan, depending on how the inflammation\n\nand bruising were resolving themselves.331.    In my opinion, a blue-black coloured scrotum\n\nmight well be conclusive that there was a scrotal haematoma but the absence of the\n\nblue-black colour is not necessarily conclusive that there could never be any trauma or\n\nphysical contusion to the testes, and hence there could not be any scrotal haematoma.332.    Prof Li Man Kay quoted from medical literature\n\nthat 50 Kg is required to cause testicular atrophy. I believe that Prof Li must be\n\nreferring to the paper Wasko and Goldstein:Traumatic rupture of the testicle,\n\nwhere the authors have estimated that a force of 50 kg of pressure is needed to rupture\n\nthe tunica albuginea in blunt scrotal trauma.333.    Although none of the experts have suggested that\n\nMr Harte had sustained any rupture of the tunica albuginea covering his testes,\n\nnevertheless it is still enlightening to find out what are the signs and symptoms expected\n\nin cases of blunt trauma involving arupture of the tunica albuginea. Fournier,\n\nLaing and McAninch stated the following at page 382 of their paper:Scrotal\n\nUltrasonograph and the Management of Testicular Trauma:Signs and SymptomsRupture of a testis secondary to blunt trauma is a violent and\n\n  immediately painful event. Wasko and Goldstein have estimated that a force of 50 kg of\n\n  pressure is needed to rupture the tunica albuginea in blunt scrotal trauma. Nausea and\n\n  vomiting are frequently associated, as occasionally is syncope.The amount of scrotal\n\n  swelling and ecchymosiscan differ.Rupture of the tunica albuginea\n\n  behind the tunica vaginaliscan be associated withno ecchymosisandminimalto moderate testicular enlargementbecause bleeding and the extruded seminiferous\n\n  tubules will be contained by the tunica vaginalis. On the other hand, if subalbugineal\n\n  arterioles are involved, the hematocele can be large and may compress the parenchyma,\n\n  eventually leading to parenchymal atrophy. If the rupture involved the junction of the\n\n  tunica albuginea and tunica vaginalis in the area of the epididymis, the bleeding will\n\n  extend into the scrotal sac proper and lead to a scrotal hematoma.Findings on physical examination arevarious.\n\n  Occasionally, the testis is displaced to the inguinal canal and not palpable in the\n\n  scrotum. The most consistent sign is exquisite pain with palpation. Scrotal ecchymosis and\n\n  swelling are also frequent, althoughtheir absence does not rule out a rupture.\n\n  The differential diagnosis includes simple hematocele without rupture, torsion of the\n\n  testis or one of the appendices, testis tumor, epididymis, reactive hydrocele, and\n\n  spermatic cord.An accurate history should be taken if possible to ascertain the\n\n  magnitude of the force causing the injury.Cassie has reported that an associated\n\n  neoplasm may predispose to rupture after apparently minor injuries. In this case,testicular\n\n  rupture was manifested by swelling and pain some 16 hours after a fall down a flight of\n\n  stairs. Patients with normal testes will report scrotal trauma that is much\n\n  more violent and directly localized and they usually experience pain and swelling\n\n  immediately; alternatively, they may have been in an accident resulting in multiple\n\n  injuries.334.    It is my opinion after considering all the\n\nevidence presented to me, that rupture of the small blood capillaries at the microscopic\n\nlevel does not require extraordinary trauma. The proposition that only extraordinary force\n\ncan cause testicular damage is simply untrue. The above passage confirms that physical\n\nsymptoms are indeed very variable. Even for testicular rupture, which is more serious, the\n\npain and swelling manifested only some 16 hours after the fall. It was not immediate. The\n\nauthors went on to say that the absence of scrotal ecchymosis (i.e. a small haemorrhagic\n\narea in the skin or mucous membrane either blue or purplish in colour) and swelling do not\n\nrule out an injury as serious as a rupture of the tunica albuginea.335.    I also disagree with the medical expert opinion\n\npresented on both sides that a bruise must necessarily appear black or as ‘black as a\n\ngown’. It seems to me that in a very severe case of bruising that might well be the\n\ncolour. But bruising from a less substantial trauma involving microvascular damage cannot\n\nto my mind, become as black as that.336.    In cases of soft tissue trauma, e.g. a heavy\n\nslap on the cheeks or thighs may cause swelling and redness but not necessarily a black or\n\nblue-black bruise. Whereas a punch landing on an area of the body which is near a bony\n\nstructure e.g. the forehead or cheekbone will more likely result in a denser blue-black\n\nbruise. Even then, it may not necessarily be of that colour as can be seen from nurse Ms\n\nTan Sang Eng’s testimony that she observed someredness(not blackness) at the\n\nplaintiff’s left forehead and left cheek after he had hit his head on the hard toilet\n\nfloor during his fall from the toilet seat. Another nurse Ms Looi Chai Hang, who saw the\n\nbruise on Mr Harte some 1 hours later described it as having avery slight bluish\n\ncolour. All this clearly shows that there is no certainty that a bruising injury must\n\nshow up as a black or blue-black swelling. It is a fallacy. As can be seen from the\n\nevidence of these two nurses, a bruise from trauma can start off with a reddish colour and\n\nlater change to a slight bluish colour. The colour changes observed on Mr Harte’s\n\nswollen scrotum are remarkably similar.337.    The swelling reactions and colour of the\n\nbruising depend on the magnitude of the force applied, whether it is an impact or\n\nnon-impact force, the kind of body tissue involved, whether the tissue is against a bone\n\nor against another soft part of the body, whether there is a rich supply of blood vessels\n\nin that area, and the degree of rupture or haemorrhage of these vessels at the traumatised\n\narea. In my opinion, there can be internal testicular haemorrhage without obvious signs\n\nappearing on the scrotum skin immediately or at all. The reddish, bluish, purplish\n\nreddish, blue-black or even black colour may surface later on as the blood from the\n\nruptured vessels in the scrotum gradually permeates to the outer skin layers, and various\n\ncomplex, biological, chemical and inflammatory reactions subsequently take place, giving\n\nthe various possible colours.338.    Thus, it is far too dogmatic to think that all\n\nscrotal bruising must be black and if there is no black colour seen, there is no bruising\n\nand therefore no trauma of any kind, or that redness seen on the scrotum must exclude an\n\nextratesticular haematoma. Not only is it simplistic, it is also unrealistic and\n\ncompletely ignores the fact that multiple factors come into play.339.    I think that a more balanced view is that\n\nexpressed in \"All New Family Medical Guide to Health and Prevention\" by\n\nMartin and Powell, 1995 Edn where it simply states:A bruise is nothing more than blood under the skin. If blood leaks out\n\n  of a blood vessel due to any cause, a bruise forms. It may bered, yellow, orange,\n\n  or blue. Blue usually indicates a deeper bruise; the color is caused by the blood\n\n  pigment, hemoglobin, reflected through skin tissue.340.    I happened to check with the Dorland’s\n\nIllustrated Medical Dictionary and am gladly reassured that the‘reddish\n\npurplish’coloured scrotum seen by Mrs Harte is entirely consistent with\n\nthe presence of a scrotal haematoma. Dorland’s Illustrated Medical Dictionary 20thEdn gives the following definitions:Ecchymosis : a smallhemorrhagic spot, larger than a petechia,\n\n  in the skin or mucous membrane forming a nonelevated rounded or irregular,blue or\n\n  purplishpatch.Petechia : a pinpoint, nonraised, perfectly round,purplish redspot caused by intradermal or submucoushemorrhage.Intradermal : 1. Within the dermis. 2. Intracutaneous.341.    Naturally, a collection of round purplish red\n\nspots caused by intradermal or submucous haemorrhage in the scrotum will show up as a\n\n‘reddish purplish’ scrotum.342.    I note that Dr Schlegel had medically examined\n\nMr Harte on 12 January 2000. Being an experienced and eminent urologist, Dr Schlegel must\n\nhave taken a detailed history from Mr Harte. Yet in his report given as late as 22 March\n\n2000, Dr Schlegel stated his view that Mr Harte had developed ascrotal haematomasubsequent to the varicocelectomy. Nothing was mentioned in Dr Schlegel’s report that\n\nMr Harte had developed an inflamed red scrotum (without a scrotal haematoma), which Dr\n\nNotley postulated had happened. I would imagine that Dr Schlegel knew the difference\n\nbetween a scrotal haematoma and an inflammatory swelling.343.    Similarly, Dr Dubin who also saw Mr Harte on 21\n\nOctober 1999 wrote to Mr Harte on 27 October 1999 stating that he hadhaematomaof\n\nthe scrotum after his operation in Singapore. Again, I imagine that Mr Harte would\n\nprobably have told Dr Dubin about the signs and symptoms he felt after his surgery and\n\nwould have given Dr Dubin the whole history. Yet Dr Dubin did not mention anything about a\n\nlarge red, hot scrotal swelling arising from a severe reactionary inflammation, which\n\nwould be quite different from a haematoma.344.    Dr Tan Hun Hoe testified that the haematoma he\n\nsaw some 4 days later was the size of a large orange and it was‘a tinge of\n\nblue’which in his opinion was due to the ‘altered blood clots’. Dr\n\nTan explained that ‘altered’ meant that the blood there was no longer\n\nfunctioning having lost its oxygen, and it was beginning to denature i.e. to change its\n\nbiological and chemical properties.345.    Dr Tan gave Mr Harte a medical report dated 24\n\nMay 1997 stating that:He was reviewed on 2ndMay ’97 and was noted to have\n\n  the complication of ascrotal haematoma. He was prescribed Zinnat, Danzen,\n\n  Voltaren and Antacids and when last reviewed on 9thMay ’97 thehaematomahad begun to subside.346.    I presume that Dr Tan based his medical report\n\non his contemporaneous medical notes on 2 May 1997 where he wrote, \"Hadscrotal\n\nhaematoma\". On 9 May 1997, he recorded, \"Haematoma subsided.Complained\n\nof hard testicles, left worse than right. Ultrasound scan: organised clot around left\n\ntesticle, small hydrocele.\"347.    The mention of an organised clot around the left\n\ntesticle also suggests to me that there was a haematoma rather than an adverse reactionary\n\ninflammation to a pair of dead infarcted testes.348.    Dr Tan in his report to the Singapore Medical\n\nCouncil dated 23 October 1998 stated that:On review on 2.5.97, he complained of ascrotal hematomathat\n\n  had developed 2 – 3 days after the operation. The hematoma wasnon-tender. He\n\n  was prescribed antibiotics prophylactically and Danzen to aid resolution of hematoma.He was reviewed again a week later on 9.5.97. Thehematomahad\n\n  subsided but he complained that the left testicle was harder than the right.The next review was on 26.5.97. The swelling had subsided almost\n\n  completely but there wasresidual indurationof the scrotal sac which was expected\n\n  to take a longer period to subside.…..…..In my opinion the cause of his testicular hypofunction is difficult to\n\n  determine at this time as it was highly unlikely that the arterial supply could have been\n\n  cut off during the operation which was carefully done with magnification. Whether the fall\n\n  and thesubsequent hematocelehad an effect on the outcome is again difficult to\n\n  ascertain. However due care was taken to manage thehematoceleconservatively as it\n\n  wasnot tenderand was expected to subside spontaneously.349.    I observe that there was mention in the\n\ncontemporaneous medical notes for 26 May 1997 that \"Induration subsided but can\n\nstill be felt. Swelling subsided.\"350.    The fact of induration of the scrotal sac\n\nsuggests the presence of some hardening due to dried blood. That was also what Dr Tan had\n\ntold Mrs Harte, which Mrs Harte had scribbled down in her notes exhibited at ABD 171.351.    Further, the fact that the scrotum was\n\nnon-tender does not suggest a severe reactionary inflammation to me. I expect a\n\nreactionary inflammation giving rise to swelling the size of a mango to be very tender.352.    The later notes taken by Dr Tan for 8 October\n\n1997 had the following remarks showing Dr Tan’s puzzlement:Discussed possibility of Retrograde ejaculation, possibility of\n\n  ‘page’ kidney effect of haematoma on testicles.? mechanism of haematoma.Haematoma occurred 2 – 3 days post operation,initially\n\n  very gradual.\"To complete the picture, his notes for 17 October 1997 were:Mrs Harte called up.Wanted clarification on operation findings and procedurePast cases and resultsDiscussed haematomaPatient’s fall in toilet on front? Cause of haematoma353.    After the defendants closed their case, counsel\n\nfor the plaintiff recalled Dr Notley who threw in at the last minute an explanation of a\n\nreactive inflammation for the bright red coloured swollen scrotum appearing on the morning\n\nafter the surgery. This red herring admittedly threw me off balance in my analysis of the\n\ncause of the bilateral testicular atrophy.354.    The sworn complaint by Mr Harte himself to the\n\nSingapore Medical Council dated 2 September 1998 puts to rest whether he had a severe\n\nreactionary inflammation or a haematoma. Mr Harte wrote:After the surgery I had a very painfulscrotal hematoma. I\n\n  consulted Dr Tan two days after the surgery and he advised that the swelling should go\n\n  down in a few days and everything would be normal. When the swelling persisted, I made an\n\n  appointment to see him. The soonest he could see me was on May 2, 1997. He said that if\n\n  the swelling did not subside he would have todrain the blood from my scrotum. He\n\n  didn’t seem concerned and asked that I return in one week for another check-up. The\n\n  swelling did eventually subside, but, until it did I called Dr. Tan on a daily basis for\n\n  advice. I asked if I shouldput ice on itand was told not to by one of his\n\n  assistants.355.    Again why should there be a need to consider\n\ndraining of blood from his scrotum if there was no haematoma but a severe reactionary\n\ninflammation? Further, why was there a need to consider putting ice on the scrotum if it\n\nwas a severe reactionary inflammation? My own understanding is that an ice pack will help\n\nreduce swelling in a haematoma and is not quite appropriate for a reactionary inflammation\n\nof a septic nature. From all the above evidence, I am convinced that Mr Harte did suffer\n\nfrom an extratesticular (or scrotal) haematoma besides an internal haematoma. This\n\nconclusion points towards physical contusion rather than surgery as the cause of both\n\nkinds of swelling.vi. Absence of abrasion and bruising on the scrotum and penis356.    A/Prof Foo held the view that it was not\n\nnecessary to have a blue-black penis in the fall from a toilet seat. I agree with him. It\n\ndepends on the nature of the force and how the force is applied. It is possible for the\n\npenis skin to be scratched when falling off a toilet seat. But the fact that scratch marks\n\nare absent cannot exclude that event. Where there is the same degree of contusion to the\n\ntestis and flaccid penis, contusion injury is more likely to surface in the testis than in\n\nthe penis because the testis is hard and taut whereas the penis is flaccid. A flaccid\n\npenis moulds to the force acting on it but not an erect penis, which can therefore suffer\n\nfrom a contusion injury. Like the erect penis, the firm testes can succumb to contusion\n\ninjury.357.    The inner rim of the toilet seat is not a sharp\n\nobject. The inner edge is contoured and smooth as can be seen in photograph D51G of the\n\nactual toilet seat in question. Given the smoothness and rounded contour, the absence of\n\nobvious abrasion or bruising on the skin of the penis or the scrotum is hardly surprising,\n\nregardless whether there was any contusion injury. Dr Notley also did not think that there\n\nwould be bruises on the penis if the patient slid over the front edge of the toilet seat.358.    I believe that the soft, flexible, stretchable\n\nscrotal skin and the underlying dartos muscle can withstand a fair amount of pressure and\n\nstretching without sustaining bruising. Dr Notley aptly observed that one could sit on the\n\nskin of the buttocks without experiencing bruising. But with the testis itself, which is\n\nencased in a tough tunica envelope, I think it is a completely different matter.\n\nCompressing an egg-like testis encased in a fairly tough, inelastic membrane generates a\n\nconsiderable buildup of pressure within it, which may cause tissue damage and haemorrhagic\n\nruptures internally without any significant observable bruising to the scrotal skin.vii. Uneven damage to testicles359.    None of the plaintiff’s experts could\n\nprovide a plausible reason based on their own theories why the testicle on the right side\n\noriginally much bigger at 25 cc had ended up being smaller at 6 cc whereas the left\n\nsmaller testicle of 15 cc had ended up being larger at 8 cc. This seems to contradict\n\ntheir position that the left operation being a repeat operation was more risky than the\n\nright. Yet the damage on the right turns out to be far more severe than the left.360.    Dr Tan offered a logical explanation that where\n\na compressive force acts on two unequal sized testicles at the same time, the larger one\n\nis naturally more traumatised. Second, the right testicle is usually attached by a shorter\n\ncord and therefore, it will sustain more of the traction injury when both testicles are\n\nequally trapped at the inner rim of the toilet seat before being pulled through and\n\ncompressed. For this reason, the right testicle will suffer greater traction injury. See\n\nthe illustrations D21 and D22 by Dr Tan. A/Prof Ng Wan Sing from the School of Mechanical\n\nand Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University confirmed this aspect of Dr\n\nTan’s evidence from an engineering point of view.361.    Dr Tan testified that a force of 50 kg would be\n\nmore than enough to rupture the tunica albugenia. The corollary would be that a force less\n\nthan 50 Kg might not cause rupture but it could still be sufficient to cause contusion\n\ninjury.362.    That the right testis has been more severely\n\natrophied is also consistent with what Munter and Faleski stated inBlunt Scrotal\n\nTrauma: Emergency Department Evaluation and Management:Testicular, scrotal, and epididymal hematomas and contusions may occur\n\n  as a direct result of a blow. Because of the shape of the testicle, its mobility within\n\n  the scrotum, and the protection of the tunica albuginia, testicular rupture occurs when\n\n  the testicle is trapped between the striking object and a hard surface, typically the\n\n  public bone or thigh. ….Theright testicle is more often injured. This is postulated to\n\n  be caused by thehigher positionof the right testicle, with a resultantgreater\n\n  chance to be caught against the pubic or ischial bone.363.    The higher position of the right testicle\n\nmentioned by Munter and Faleski confirms what Dr Tan had said that the right testicle is\n\nusually attached by a shorter spermatic cord.",
        "(g) Biomechanical analysis": "364.    Dr Tan’s principal defence was that the\n\nfall of Mr Harte from the toilet seat was the sole cause of his bilateral testicular\n\natrophy (‘fall theory’). The plaintiff weighed about 103 kg at that time. He was\n\nindeed heavy. By comparison, a force of 50 kg would be sufficient to cause rupture and\n\nvery severe damage to the testes. Having heard evidence from two engineers, I shall now\n\nscrutinise Dr Tan’s ‘fall theory’.365.    Mrs Harte described how Mr Harte fell:There were 3 nurses may be 4 nurses were holding him and walking him to\n\n  the toilet and I was following behind. They sat him on the toilet and then they left the\n\n  toilet. I remained inside. He was looking a little pale at that time and was sweating. So\n\n  I turned around to the sink to get a paper towel. When I turned round back to Denis, his\n\n  eyes were rolling back in his head and I could see that he was about to pass out. I moved\n\n  towards him to hold him up but he was already falling forward. So I grabbed him to try to\n\n  break the fall and that’s when he hit his head on the floor.When he was falling, I grabbed his body at his chest and back, but he\n\n  was so heavy that he continued to go forward and his head hit the floor first, followed on\n\n  by the rest of his body. He was lying eventually on his left side with his left leg on the\n\n  floor and the right crossed over his left leg and his hand above his head. As he was\n\n  falling, his buttocks lifted upwards up from the toilet seat. At the time of falling, both\n\n  his feet were at the axle point of the roll.As his head hit the floor, his body was in a couched position with his\n\n  body fairly close to his thighs, when he rolled onto the floor hitting his head.366.    According to Mrs Harte, his body was so heavy\n\nthat as he fell forward, his buttocks automatically rose upwards. His head hit the floor\n\nfirst. He eventually landed on his left side with his right leg crossed. His knee was\n\nprotecting his groin and scrotal area. She maintained that his scrotum wasnot crushed.367.    This part of her evidence seems contrived\n\nbecause I do not think she was in a position to see whether his scrotum was ever\n\nsandwiched between his body and the floor. I also doubt that she could have in that split\n\nsecond observed that Mr Harte’s scrotum was not crushed by the toilet seat,\n\nespecially when her attention was focussed on preventing Mr Harte from falling. One has to\n\nbear in mind that Mr Harte was in hospital attire at that time which would have obscured\n\nmuch of her view in any case. As with all oral evidence, there is always a possibility of\n\nwrong recollections and even biased embellishments. For instance, Mrs Harte’s\n\nevidence that 3 or 4 nurses held and walked Mr Harte to the toilet with herself following\n\nbehind was contradicted by nurse Tan Sang Eng who said that only she and Mrs Harte helped\n\nMr Harte into the toilet and seated him.368.    After Mr Harte fell, Mrs Harte ran to get help.\n\nThe nurses came. Mrs Harte and the nurses could not lift him up from the floor because he\n\nwas so heavy. After Mr Harte regained consciousness, he got up himself with some\n\nassistance from them.369.    A/Prof Ng Wan Sing from the School of Mechanical\n\nand Production Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, was called by Dr Tan to\n\nsubstantiate his fall theory. A/Prof Ng’s report is at D 40.370.    A/Prof Ng basically applied a static analysis to\n\nwhat was clearly a dynamic situation. In my opinion, his qualitative analysis is a little\n\nsimplistic. The results of A/Prof Ng’s analysis can easily mislead if the limitations\n\nof his static model are not fully appreciated. A/Prof Ng conceded that his static analysis\n\nhad not taken into account the dynamic nature of the forces, motions and accelerations.\n\nHis static model projected a shifting pivoting point about the toilet seat with toppling\n\nand sliding occurring thereafter. As Mr Harte slid off the edge of the toilet seat under\n\nthe full weight of his body and given the closeness of his scrotum to the inner rim of the\n\ntoilet seat, A/Prof Ng concluded that it was ‘very possible that the scrotum\n\npressed against the seat and rim during the roll over and sliding’. With only a\n\nqualitative analysis, Prof Ng could not determine the amount of clearance, if any, between\n\nthe toilet seat and Mr Harte’s perineum region as Mr Harte slid off. Neither could\n\nProf Ng establish the magnitude of the compressive force.371.    I find that A/Prof Lim Chwee Teck from the\n\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering, National University of Singapore, presented a far\n\nmore sophisticated quantitative finite element analysis using the computer software called\n\n‘ABAQUS/Explicit finite element software.’ The computer simulation models the\n\ndynamics of the plaintiff falling off the toilet seat when he lost consciousness. From the\n\ntrajectories, one can study whether Mr Harte’s scrotum would be caught underneath the\n\ntoilet seat or pressed between his body and the toilet seat during the fall. A/Prof Lim\n\nwas tasked to analyse the dynamic nature of the free fall due to gravity assuming\n\ndifferent initial torso angles of Mr Harte just before his torso started collapsing to his\n\nthighs due to syncope.372.    I agree that A/Prof Lim’s dynamic analysis\n\nbetter predicts the trajectory of the fall than A/Prof Ng’s static analysis. A/Prof\n\nLim’s report is at P50.373.    The approximations and assumptions applied in\n\nA/Prof Lim’s model must be fully appreciated. He approximated the mass distribution,\n\ncentre of mass and radius of gyration, and then calculated the moment of inertia of the\n\nvarious segments of Mr Harte’s body relying on the ‘Dempster’s Body\n\nSegment Parameter Data for 2-Dimensional Studies’ shown at Appendix B of his\n\nreport. The coefficient of friction between the plaintiff’s thigh and toilet seat was\n\nobtained from a paper ‘Friction behaviour of human skin’by Sasada, Ide\n\nand Kawakami. The plaintiff’s body is modelled as 4 segments viz (a) head, trunk and\n\narms; (b) thighs and pelvis; (c) legs; and (d) feet. Each is modelled as a rigid segment\n\nconnected to the other segments using frictionless joints.374.    As Mr Harte fell in an unconscious state, it is\n\nassumed that he lost muscular control instantaneously. Therefore, all the major joints in\n\nhis body are approximated to function as loose frictionless joints. Mr Harte’s body\n\nis assumed to be a deadweight falling under the influence of gravity. The model simply\n\ntreats Mr Harte’s non-rigid 3-Dimensional body as a rigid 2-Dimensional body with\n\nfrictionless joints and with certain maximum limits of collapse angles at the knees and\n\nankles based on actual measurements taken from Mr Harte himself.375.    In his report, A/Prof Lim described his\n\nengineering findings on the dynamics of the fall as follows:(a) The upper torso first pivots about the pelvis until it hits the\n\n  thighs.(b) The upper torso and thigh then pivot as one mass about the knee\n\n  with some simultaneous pivoting of the leg about the ankle.(c) The knee then starts to collapse under the weight of the body and\n\n  reaches the minimum angle achieved by the knee.(d) The head and upper torso continue to move forward and downward with\n\n  the head hitting the floor first followed by the rest of the body.(e) There is no sliding of the thighs on the toilet seat due to the\n\n  great inertial torque arising from the substantial deceleration upon the rigid body\n\n  impact.(f) The buttocks lift off the toilet seat.(g) There is noticeable clearance between the scrotum and toilet seat\n\n  based on a hanging distance of the scrotum of 6 cm.(h) The closest the scrotum gets to the toilet seat during the fall is\n\n  approximated to be about 4 cm, 3 cm and 2 cm for the fall from 80 , 70 and 60\n\n  positions respectively.376.    I accept that finite element analysis using\n\nsoftware packages and computers are often used to perform complicated, engineering\n\ncalculations and to solve complex engineering problems. In this case, the modelling of the\n\nfall (assuming different starting angles of a human body with the physical characteristics\n\nof Mr Harte and with certain general parameters obtained from biomechanical data about the\n\ndistribution of body mass, radius of gyration and the position of the centre of mass for\n\neach of the body segments modelled), gives a better insight and understanding of the\n\nmotions and trajectories of a fall off a toilet seat under the influence of gravity. Short\n\nof replicating either with Mr Harte on the toilet seat and subjecting him to anaesthesia\n\nto create the unconsciousness, or with an actual 3-Dimensional model built to mimic the\n\nphysical characteristics of Mr Harte, the 2-Dimensional computer simulation is the next\n\nbest and most practical solution. Although it is helpful as a guide, nevertheless one must\n\nremember its limitations and its inability to fully simulate the human body, which is\n\nflesh and blood.377.    The most useful part of the finite element\n\ndynamic analysis as opposed to the common sense and more readily understood static\n\nanalysis of A/Prof Ng is to demonstrate the hitherto unforeseen effect of rotation of the\n\ntorso about the knees before collapsing because of the forward and angular momentum of the\n\ntorso in the course of the fall. Where there is no slip between the feet and the toilet\n\nfloor, the tibia and fibula bones of the lower part of the leg act as a strong strut and\n\nthey can transmit forces along its length through the frictionless pivot at the knee\n\njoint, to allow the upper torso to use it momentarily as a strut, over which the torso\n\ncould continue to rotate about the knee pivot in the course of falling. The initial torso\n\nrotation about the strut at the knee pivot is the main reason for the ‘lift’ of\n\nthe buttocks off the toilet seat or the ‘flying’ motion as described by Dr Myint\n\nSoe in his submissions. This fall trajectory cannot be appreciated without the dynamic\n\nanalysis. The computer program is at exhibit P55 with full instructions for its operation.378.    A/Prof Ng in my view had no engineering basis\n\nfor asserting that the ankles of the plaintiff would buckle from the onset of the fall and\n\nthat the tibia and fibula would not act as a ‘strut’ and therefore, Mr\n\nHarte’s torso could only rotate about the toilet seat as he fell off. Of course, if\n\nthe feet of the plaintiff had already slipped (for instance where the floor was slippery),\n\nthen the tibia and fibula would not function properly as a strut, and there might not be\n\nany pivoting about the knee at all in the course of the fall. The body would then have\n\nfallen as if the obstruction (in the way of the fall) from the lower leg were not there at\n\nall.379.    However, as the angle of the lower leg in\n\nrelation to the floor was close to 90 , and as the floor was not exactly slippery, I\n\ntake the view that the friction force was sufficient to prevent any slippage at the feet\n\nat least at the initial part of the torso rotation about the knee. I find support for this\n\nin the evidence of Mrs Harte that ‘at the time of falling, both his feet were at\n\nthe axle point of the roll.’380.    During the later stages of the fall and as the\n\nangle of the lower leg to the floor became more acute, it might well be that the friction\n\nforces between the feet and the floor were overcome at some stage and both feet would\n\nbegin to slip backwards. However, these later stages of the fall were not material in my\n\nanalysis whether contusion was in fact possible. The effect of the feet slippage is\n\nrelevant only when one needs to consider how much closer the final rest position of the\n\nbody and buttocks after the fall was going to be. Logically, the earlier the slippage of\n\nthe feet during the fall, the nearer would be the final position of the body to the toilet\n\nbowl.381.    If Mr Harte had fallen from a starting position\n\nwith his torso completely resting on his thighs, then the results of A/Prof Lim’s\n\nanalysis and A/Prof Ng’s analysis would tend to converge. In other words, the dynamic\n\nmodel predicts much of the outcome of the static model when the initial fall angle is set\n\nat the minimum of 25 , which essentially transforms the dynamic model into a static\n\nmodel. At 25 , there will no longer be any angular rotation nor angular momentum left in\n\nthe torso just prior to hitting the thighs.382.    A/Prof Lim gave a quantitative analysis for the\n\nwhole spectrum of fall angles between 80 and 30 whereas A/Prof Ng’s qualitative\n\nanalysis related only to the far end of that spectrum with the fall angle at 25 . The\n\nreal answer is probably somewhere in between the two ends of the spectrum. But which end\n\nof the spectrum is the actual fall going to be nearer? If the torso angle is closer to the\n\nlow end of the spectrum (i.e. nearer the 25 angle which is the equivalent of the static\n\nmodel), then there is a higher probability of contusion. If the torso angle is towards the\n\nhigh end of the spectrum, then there is a higher probability that the scrotum will clear\n\nthe toilet seat and not be contused at all.383.    Based purely on common sense (which I must\n\ncaution myself may well be wrong), if the torso starts to fall from an angle closer to\n\n25 (which essentially is the static model), I reason that the buttocks will slide first\n\nbefore toppling over the edge of the toilet seat. If there is any lifting of the buttocks\n\nin the course of the fall, it will be minimal. More likely, the lift will not be\n\nsufficient to enable the scrotum to clear the rim of the toilet seat. As such, it is\n\nprobable for the scrotum and the then much larger testicles (prior to his atrophy) to be\n\nsquashed by his heavy torso in the course of sliding off the toilet seat as he fell. Can\n\nthis common sense reasoning of mine be confirmed more scientifically by the dynamic finite\n\nelement model of A/Prof Lim? I shall now proceed to examine this.384.    I note that there are many important unknown\n\nparameters which affect the outcome predicted by the simulation: (a) elasticity and energy\n\nabsorption characteristics of the stomach and thighs at the point of impact; (b) how Mrs\n\nHarte had held the plaintiff, the amount of force she applied to prevent the fall and the\n\namount of energy she expended in doing so; (c) the rate at which Mr Harte lost\n\nconsciousness; and (d) the energy loss in the process of stretching the strong back\n\nmuscles of the torso and the skin as the body fell.385.    Since these parameters were not known or readily\n\navailable, A/Prof Lim recognised that he had totally ignored them to make the modelling\n\neasier. He readily acknowledged that if these unknown parameters were taken into account,\n\nthey would affect the clearance between the toilet seat and the scrotum.386.    What is clear in my mind is that these unknown\n\nparameters will negate the dynamic effects from the falling torso, reduce the angular\n\nvelocity and momentum of the torso just before the impact on the thighs. Hence the\n\n‘lift effect’ due to the rotation about the knee will be substantially reduced.\n\nConsequently, the clearance between the toilet seat and scrotum diminishes. It is\n\nconceivable based on the dynamic finite element model that the plaintiff’s body might\n\nhave crashed down after being lifted slightly, and thereafter squashed or crushed his\n\nscrotum on the toilet seat before he finally fell to the floor.387.    One way to demonstrate the effects of these\n\nunknown parameters is to treat the plaintiff as having fallen from a lower torso angle\n\nposition to compensate for these unknown parameters (which I shall call\n\n‘interventions’). Simulating lower torso angles indirectly allows the finite\n\nelement computation of the fall dynamics to factor in all the interventions. To enable me\n\nto have some understanding of the trajectories when these unknown parameters are taken\n\ninto consideration, I therefore directed A/Prof Lim to perform further computer\n\nsimulations for lower angles from 50 down to 30 . In other words, an 80 fall, after\n\nfactoring all the interventions, may be approximated by a 50 simulation. Similarly, a\n\n70 fall after accounting for the effects from all the interventions may be represented\n\nby a 40 simulation. A fall from 70 with the interventions taken into consideration may\n\nbe the equivalent of a simulated fall from an assumed torso angle of 30.i. Interventions388.    I shall now elaborate on these interventions,\n\nwhich collectively would reduce the angular velocities, angular momentum and rate of fall\n\nof the collapsing torso:(a)    Mrs Harte’s attempt to stop Mr Harte’s\n\n  fall in my opinion is a significant intervention. She managed to catch him at his chest to\n\n  prevent him from falling. She must have caught him fairly early in the fall because it was\n\n  not likely for her to catch him at his chest level if Mr Harte had already fallen close to\n\n  his thighs. Further, she had some time to anticipate as she saw his eyeballs rolling and\n\n  thus, would have time to place herself in a position to grab him. Faced with that\n\n  situation, I imagine Mrs Harte as a dutiful wife would have mustered all her strength to\n\n  stop his fall. She might even have used her body to push him back. Certainly, it could not\n\n  be a half-hearted attempt. Being a well-built Caucasian woman, I think she would be quite\n\n  strong. Her considerable intervention slowed down the rate of fall and hence, the ability\n\n  of the torso to pick up momentum. The energy in the falling torso, manifested in its\n\n  linear and angular velocities, would be correspondingly reduced. Not satisfied with merely\n\n  a qualitative reasoning (which I accept can be erroneous), I looked for some confirmation\n\n  by some quantitative analysis and modelling. For this, I have asked for and I have the\n\n  benefit of A/Prof Lim’s programme written on Microsoft Excel (P55 file) computing (a)\n\n  the potential energy released as a result of the fall of the heavy torso of Mr Harte for\n\n  various fall angles, and (b) the energy reduction caused by Mrs Harte’s intervention\n\n  assuming a range of angles for her intervention at different levels of force applied by\n\n  her to prevent the fall. After using the programme and going through the various\n\n  possibilities (see P55A for the computations I have done using the programme and Annex A\n\n  for the results), I estimate that it is likely that her intervention could have reduced\n\n  the energy in Mr Harte’s fall by between 30 to 50 %. I therefore conclude with a fair\n\n  degree of confidence that Mrs Harte’s intervention is a very significant factor in\n\n  reducing the velocity and energy of Mr Harte’s fall.(b)    The energy absorbed by the elastic tissues and\n\n  muscles during the compression of the large stomach and the fleshy thighs of Mr Harte\n\n  would also slow down the momentum of the fall. In a simulated fall impact experiment on\n\n  trochanteric soft tissues, a total energy of 140 J was applied in each impact. The tissue\n\n  energy absorption ranged from 8.4 to 81.6 J. (which corresponds to energy absorption of\n\n  between 8% to 58%). Increased tissue thickness correlated strongly with increased tissue\n\n  energy absorption capacity. See the paper on ‘Force attenuation in trochanteric\n\n  soft tissues during impact from a fall’ by J Orthop in the Journal of Orthopaedic\n\n  Research Nov 1995. Since Mr Harte had substantial fatty padding around his stomach, pelvis\n\n  and thighs, they must account for a fair amount of energy absorption.(c)    The back muscles are huge muscle groups with\n\n  strong ligaments. They must be stretched when the torso bends during the fall. The skin of\n\n  the back also stretches, including the intervertebral discs and tissues at the spine.\n\n  Together they would reduce the energy and momentum of the fall and the impact of Mr\n\n  Harte’s torso on his thighs.(d)    Loss of consciousness is not instantaneous. The\n\n  body gradually loses its muscle tone and then collapses. Consequently, the fall might\n\n  actually start from a lower angle than what would ordinarily be Mr Harte’s normal\n\n  position when seated on a toilet bowl. The momentum generated from a fall from a lower\n\n  angle is necessarily less.(e)    The rigid segment analysis ignores the fact that\n\n  the plaintiff’s body is made of multiple joints and a considerable amount of soft\n\n  tissue padding. For a start, there are 26 joints alone between the head and the hip. But\n\n  they are simulated by one rigid segment in the finite element programme. When a fall\n\n  occurs, the 26 joints move together at different rates. The whole body of an unconscious\n\n  man is much more wobbly than a rigid segment of a few joints. There will be shifts of body\n\n  weights and forces during the descent, which is quite unlike a rigid model.",
        "ii. Inferences drawn from Computer Simulation": "389.    In my judgment, the above interventions will\n\nsubstantially reduce the momentum and energy of the falling torso. Hence, the so called\n\n‘lift’ of the buttocks upwards in a circular arc about the knee and later about\n\nthe ankle, as observed in the computer simulation for 80 to 60 is significantly\n\nreduced.390.    As an indication of the effects of such\n\nreductions, I studied in slow motion the fall characteristics as predicted by A/Prof\n\nLim’s dynamic finite element analysis. For fall angles of 50 to 30 , the\n\nsimulation predicts that the scrotum will actually impact on the toilet seat for the 40\n\nand 30 fall angles, whereas the available clearance (i.e. gap between the toilet seat\n\nand Mr Harte’s perineum) in the case of the fall angle of 50 has become fairly\n\nsmall. These lower fall angles give a good indication of what the actual fall dynamics are\n\ngoing to be, when the fall energy has been reduced by the intervention of Mrs Harte,\n\nabsorbed by the back muscles, abdomen, thighs and skin during stretching and so on. The\n\nsum total of these multiple interventions is that the ‘dynamic lift effect’ seen\n\nin the fall angles from 80 to 60 in fact may not be sufficient to lift Mr Harte’s\n\nscrotum clear of the toilet seat to avoid any contusion. The common sense analysis is to\n\nthat extent corroborated by the dynamic model of A/Prof Lim.391.    I am reinforced in my conclusion by the\n\nundisputed evidence below that the energy and momentum in the fall is not as great as that\n\ndemonstrated for the fall angles from 80 to 60 and is in fact much closer to the other\n\nend of the spectrum represented by A/Prof Ng’s static analysis:(a)    The final positions predicted by the dynamic\n\n  analysis for 80 to 60 angles appear to be too far away from the toilet seat. The model\n\n  predicts a lively forward movement that thrust Mr Harte’s head so far forward as to\n\n  be below the toilet sink with his buttocks a good half a metre away from the far edge of\n\n  the toilet bowl. The final position of Mr Harte’s buttocks as enacted by Mr Daniel Xu\n\n  based on the evidence of nurse Tan Sang Eng (who tried her best to reconstruct the final\n\n  position of Mr Harte after the fall in the toilet) shows that Mr Harte’s buttocks\n\n  were in fact much nearer the edge of the toilet seat. See photographs P40 A to C showing\n\n  what would be the final position of Mr Harte viz a viz the toilet seat and the other wall\n\n  structures in the toilet which were set up to scale in court. The toilet bowl was the\n\n  actual one used by Mr Harte, which Gleneagles Hospital managed to preserve when the ward\n\n  was renovated. The fact that the buttocks were fairly near the edge of the toilet seat\n\n  suggests to me that the rate of fall must have been considerably slower than that\n\n  predicted by the 80 to 60 fall angles. As expected, the fall angles of 80 to 60\n\n  divorced from all the effects of the abovementioned interventions have wrongly postulated\n\n  the position where Mr Harte landed on the floor. The true position is in my view more\n\n  realistically predicted by fall angles of 50 to 30 , which do take account of the\n\n  effects of the interventions and which give results approaching that of A/Prof Ng’s\n\n  static model analysis. In short, after taking everything into consideration, I infer from\n\n  the finite element modelling done by A/Prof Lim that there was a high probability of a\n\n  contusion of the scrotum on the edge of the toilet seat rather than a trajectory that\n\n  allowed an unconscious Mr Harte to ‘fly over’ the edge of the toilet seat in the\n\n  course of the fall. An unconscious man cannot be expected to use his leg muscles to lift\n\n  himself and hence, lift his scrotum clear of and away from the toilet seat to avoid any\n\n  impact or contact with it.(b)    Most critically, if indeed the momentum and\n\n  velocities of the fall were as great as predicted by the model for the fall angles of 80\n\n  to 60 with his head hitting the floor first, most probably Mr Harte’s skull would\n\n  have been cracked. However he escaped with a small reddish minor bruise and no swelling on\n\n  his forehead, which later turned into a slight bluish bruise also with no swelling, and\n\n  thus required no treatment whatsoever. This strongly suggests that his was a very low\n\n  velocity impact. He did not crash onto the hard tiled floor in the toilet. It further\n\n  suggests a ‘crumbling’ fall and a slow sliding off the toilet\n\n  seat. This minor injury thus falls into its proper place. It is obvious to me that the\n\n  80 to 60 finite element modelling gives a wrong result and must be rejected. Based on\n\n  the evidence of the minor bruising on the forehead, I infer that the appropriate model\n\n  should be much closer to the 30 to 50 finite element models, where the effects of the\n\n  interventions are not ignored. Not surprisingly, A/Prof Lim’s model, though it is\n\n  only a guide, has predicted a contusion of the scrotum on the toilet seat, which is\n\n  exactly what I think is likely to have happened.iii. Position of scrotum viz a viz the toilet seat392.    Mr Hart was indeed very cooperative and had\n\nallowed himself to be photographed without his clothes on and seated on the very same\n\ntoilet seat from which he fell. With Mr Harte seated on the toilet seat, there was hardly\n\nany gap between his penis and the inner edge of the toilet seat. This is understandable as\n\nthe actual toilet seat he used in Gleneagles Hospital was small relative to his large size\n\nand build. Photograph D 51B shows the position of his penis when Mr Harte was seated\n\nnormally on the toilet seat. It was estimated from the various scans taken that his\n\nscrotum would be hanging down some 8 cm or more beneath the toilet seat after bending over\n\nfully with his torso touching his thighs, which would have been the final position from\n\nwhich he fell off the toilet seat. In that position, his scrotum should be most vulnerable\n\nas it would be drooping deepest beneath the level of the toilet seat. Photographs D51D and\n\nD51E give an idea of the extent by which the plaintiff’s scrotum was hanging.393.    Consideration must be given to the fact that Mr\n\nHarte’s atrophied testes were already much smaller and presumably lighter in weight\n\nat the time the photographs were taken. Common sense tells me that his scrotum just before\n\nthe fall, containing two much larger and heavier testes and aggravated by the usual\n\nswelling after a varicocelectomy, would necessarily droop even deeper into the toilet\n\nbowl. Obviously, a larger scrotum hanging lower beneath the toilet seat is far less likely\n\nto escape contusion in a fall off a toilet seat in an unconscious state when the legs no\n\nlonger retained any muscle control to lift the body, and consequently also the scrotum\n\nsafely clear of the toilet seat.394.    Since Mr Harte fell from a most vulnerable\n\nposition when his slightly swollen scrotum after the operation was hanging deepest in the\n\ntoilet bowl, the forward movement of the body during the fall would push his penis and\n\nscrotum to be jammed between the perineum and pelvic bone on the top, and the hard but\n\nsmooth upper surface of the toilet seat at the bottom, whilst hemmed in at the same time\n\nby the inner thighs on both sides. The resultant effect is a fairly hard squeezing of the\n\ntesticles on all sides for a short duration when his heavy body moved forward and fell\n\neventually, pulling along with it and crushing the scrotum and testes as they passed over\n\nthe smooth edged toilet seat, which consequently resulted in the contusion injury. A close\n\nanalogy is the extraction of sugar cane juice by pulling sugar cane between two horizontal\n\nrollers set at a gap smaller than the thickness of the sugar cane. The compression of the\n\nsugar cane between the rollers causes the juice to be separated or squeezed out from the\n\nsugar cane fibres.Conclusion395.    I fully sympathise with the condition of Mr\n\nHarte. It was a most unfortunate accident. Regrettably, I come to the conclusion based on\n\nthe evidence that the mechanics of Mr Harte’s fall were in fact closer to that put\n\nforward by A/Prof Ng than that suggested by A/Prof Lim.396.    For all the reasons given, I find on a balance\n\nof probability that both testes suffered contusion injury from the fall. The contusion was\n\nnot especially severe but it was sufficient to cause intratesticular microvascular damage\n\nand haemorrhage, which eventually resulted in patchy and non-homogeneous damage to the\n\nsmaller testis on the left and much more severe damage to the larger testis on the right\n\nas would be expected when both testes were contused at the same time. This easily explains\n\nthe bilateral nature of the damage which, had the cause been surgical in nature, would not\n\nbe that readily explainable.397.    The contusion not only caused an intratesticular\n\nhaematoma, it also led to an extratesticular haematoma, which developed slowly as there\n\nwas similarly microvascular and microbleeding in the extratesticular tissues in the\n\nscrotum on both sides of the septum. As the scrotal swelling increased, it also pushed the\n\nscrotum to the size of a mango and added some more pressure on the already congested\n\ntestes labouring under their own separate intratesticular haematomas. The combined\n\npressure aggravated the whole situation, by forcing a serious but not total venous\n\nshutdown within the testes, which led unfortunately to the high degree of vascular and\n\natrophic damage seen eventually on Mr Harte’s testes.398.    I must record my appreciation to A/Prof Lim for\n\nhis extremely helpful computer modelling and the short program written on the Microsoft\n\nExcel which enabled me to feed into it different parameters to study the overall effect of\n\nMrs Harte’s intervention. His dynamic analysis using the finite element modelling\n\nwith data from Dempster’s Tables helped me to better envisage the likely trajectories\n\nthat an unconscious man falling off a toilet seat might take. With A/Prof Lim’s\n\nsimulation, I am reinforced in my view that on a balance of probability, it was the fall\n\nthat contused and damaged his testes and not Dr Tan’s surgery.399.    Exhibit P55 has a Zip Drive/CD-ROM containing\n\nthe computer simulation results. It also contains the Microsoft Excel Program to compute\n\nthe energy input from Mrs Harte for various degrees of intervention by her.",
        "Statistical analysis": "400.    My conclusion also matches up with my\n\nstatistical analysis, which I shall elaborate below.401.    If indeed the operation by Dr Tan had caused the\n\ndisastrous results, that would represent 2 negligent operations (because he botched up\n\ntwice, one on the left varicocelectomy and the other on the right) out of 200 previously\n\nsuccessful varicocele operations on other patients or an estimated average of 1/100 chance\n\nof negligence. Dr Tan, a qualified and practising surgeon of many years, had in fact\n\nperformed other far more complicated operations without any reports of negligence. For the\n\npurpose of this analysis, I shall ignore them. (If these other operations are included,\n\nthe average statistical probability of negligence on the part of Dr Tan will be further\n\ndiminished.)402.    Clearly, the bilateral varicocelectomy operation\n\non Mr Harte comprised two separate and independent operations. To have botched up on both\n\nsides means that Dr Tan was negligent in two consecutive varicocele operations. Prima\n\nfacie, that is statistically very remote because the mathematical probability is 1/100\n\nmultiplied by 1/100 giving a 1/10,000 chance of it happening consecutively. As Dr Notley\n\nvery rightly conceded, it is rare to have infarction and resulting testicular atrophy\n\nafter a varicocelectomy. It is even rarer for a bilateral testicular atrophy to take place\n\nafter a bilateral varicocele operation.403.    Why must it be the case then that on the very\n\nrare occasion (1 out of 10,000) when Dr Tan had botched up his two operations\n\nconsecutively, the patient was also found to have sustained a fall, an undisputed fact\n\nbefore me? Just by statistical probabilities alone, the fact that the plaintiff’s\n\nfall had to coincide with an extremely remote case of an alleged consecutive negligence\n\nrenders it statistically most unlikely that the operation was the cause of the bilateral\n\ntesticular atrophy. It would be far more likely for the fall to have caused the atrophy.404.    This statistical evaluation based on pure\n\nprobabilities and statistical reasoning is certainly evidence that has some probative\n\nvalue and is part of the overall circumstantial evidence from which one may infer that it\n\nwas the fall and not the operation that had caused the damage. Even without support from\n\nthis statistical analysis, I am already satisfied on a balance of probability that the\n\nfall was the cause of the atrophy.405.    From the totality of the evidence in this case,\n\nthe plaintiff has failed to discharge the requisite burden placed on him by law to prove\n\non a balance of probability that Dr Tan had not discharged his duty of care to Mr Harte in\n\nhis operation. The legal burden of proof remains always with the plaintiff. It is not for\n\nthe 1stdefendant to satisfy the court that he was not negligent. The 1stdefendant only has a ‘persuasive burden’ to ensure that the balance of\n\nprobability is not tilted against him.406.    However, Dr Tan adduced so much evidence that he\n\nmanaged to tilt the balance against the plaintiff and establish on a balance of\n\nprobability that the fall did cause the resultant damage.407.    If I am wrong in this finding, I continue to\n\nhold the view that Dr Tan has furnished more than sufficient evidence to discharge his\n\npersuasive burden and rebut the plaintiff’s case sufficiently to the extent that the\n\nplaintiff has not been able to prove to my satisfaction that Dr Tan was negligent in his\n\noperation.408.    The matter does not end here, as I have to be\n\ncertain that Dr Tan was also fulfilling his duty of care to his patient after the surgery,\n\nwhich I shall refer to as his post-operative treatment, management and care of his\n\npatient.Post-operative negligence(a) 1stday after surgery.409.    Ms Magdalene Taye, the then clinic assistant\n\nemployed by Dr Tan, averred in her affidavit of evidence-in-chief that she did not receive\n\nany telephone call from the plaintiff (a) complaining of scrotum pain or swelling, or (b)\n\nrequesting for an early appointment. If she did, she would make sure that Dr Tan was\n\ninformed. Nothing could be found in the clinical notes to indicate that Mr Harte had\n\ntelephoned Dr Tan or the clinic. According to Ms Taye, it was the standard practice to\n\nwrite down telephone messages for Dr Tan and to provide Dr Tan with the case notes in\n\nrelation to the caller. She was affirmative in her evidence that had she received any\n\ncomplaints from Mr Harte on the telephone, she would definitely let Dr Tan know. If there\n\nwas anything else, she would definitely ask him to come back to see Dr Tan.410.    There was a staff nurse, Ms Louise Lee Hui San,\n\nwho also worked for Dr Tan at that time. She was not called to testify. Ms Kamisah,\n\nanother of Dr Tan’s staff, also did not testify. It was not clear if they were the\n\nones who received Mr Harte’s telephone calls on the morning following the surgery\n\nwhen Mr Harte desperately tried to contact Dr Tan.411.    Dr Tan’s case was that Mr Harte never\n\ncalled at all. I find that extremely hard to accept given the pain and swelling that Mr\n\nHarte was experiencing the morning after the surgery. I accept Mr Harte’s evidence\n\nthat he managed eventually to speak to Dr Tan about his post-operative condition.412.    When a doctor hears his patient making such\n\ncomplaints on the morning after the surgery, what must he do? A/Prof Foo answering for\n\nhimself said that he would see the patient at the earliest convenient time. He might see\n\nthe patient the next morning if it was not too urgent and the complaint was received after\n\noffice hours.413.    A/Prof Foo opined that it was not reasonable\n\npost-operative care for a doctor to ignore the urgency and postpone seeing the patient\n\nafter learning that his patient had complained of pain and scrotal swelling. He should see\n\nthe patient. I agree entirely. Dr Tan should have asked Mr Harte to see him immediately. I\n\nsee no good excuse for his failure.414.    Even if the telephone call from Mr Harte were to\n\nbe received by a nurse and that message was not brought to the attention of the doctor,\n\nthe doctor would still be vicariously responsible for the negligent act of his own nurse.\n\nThe doctor must be responsible for the management of his own clinic and ensure that there\n\nis a system where important messages are promptly brought to his immediate attention.\n\nSometimes it may make the difference between life and death.415.    In my judgment, Dr Tan had failed in his duty of\n\ncare when he did not arrange for Mr Harte to be examined as soon as possible, after having\n\nbeen told of the extent of his unusual pain and swelling. Dr Tan was clearly negligent in\n\nhis post-operative care of Mr Harte. Even if he did not receive the messages from Mr Harte\n\nbecause none of his nurses brought them to his attention, he would still be vicariously\n\nliable nonetheless.",
        "(b) 4thday after surgery": "416.    It is undisputed that the swelling was severe,\n\nwhether one goes by Mr Harte’s description of the size of a mango or that of a\n\ngrapefruit by Dr Tan. That severity of swelling must be of immediate concern and was\n\ncertainly abnormal for a bilateral subinguinal operation.417.    Dr Tan testified that he could not palpate the\n\ntesticles through the swollen scrotum on 2 May 1997, which was the 1stconsultation 4 days after the surgery. Why did he not use the ultrasound machine in his\n\nown office or the more sophisticated hospital CDUS facilities to investigate the condition\n\nof Mr Harte’s testicles? This was very puzzling. Instead he prescribed more medicine\n\nand sent Mr Harte home after reassuring him that the swelling would subside. Strangely, he\n\nused his own ultrasound machine to examine the plaintiff’s scrotum several days later\n\non 9 May 1997 after the swelling had subsided and the testes were palpable, when one would\n\nhave expected him at least to have used his own ultrasound machine on 2 May 1997 for the\n\nvery reason that Mr Harte’s testes were not palpable then.418.    A/Prof Foo opined that it wasdangerousto send the plaintiff home with some medication under those circumstances and that an\n\nultrasound should have been done first. If the ultrasound results show a pair of big\n\nswollen testes, A/Prof Foo said, \"Yes, we might want toexplore and drain\n\nthe haematoma, your Honour …. To reduce the pressure on the testes.\"\n\nIn his opinion, it might be too late after 4 days, but some testicular tissue might still\n\nbe saved. He would have immediately drained the testis by cutting the tunica, and let the\n\nblood and blood clots flow off. He would not have just prescribed medicine and sent him\n\nhome. According to A/Prof Foo, this was the \"minimum standard he would\n\nexpect of any other urologist in the same position\".419.    A/Prof Li also agreed that he would use an\n\nultrasound machine to check the swollen and non-palpable scrotum. If done, I think the\n\nCDUS would probably show up a dangerous and severe intratesticular swelling in both testes\n\nrequiring emergency treatment and drainage.420.    I would regard the views of A/Prof Foo and\n\nA/Prof Li as being representative of a body of responsible, reasonable and respectable\n\nurologists as to what ought to or should have been done. I believe what was said is also\n\nequally applicable in relation to the proper treatment that should have been given on 29\n\nApril 1997, had Dr Tan acted responsibly and examined Mr Harte on that very morning after\n\nthe surgery when he received complaints of unusual pain and swelling.421.    An opinion that there is no necessity to explore\n\nand drain the haematoma after discovering the dangerous and fairly substantial\n\nintratesticular haematoma in both testes is to my mind not a reasonable or responsible one\n\nthat any respectable and competent urologist could honestly hold. It does not make any\n\nsense not to try to do something to save the situation but let the dangerous and severe\n\nbilateral intratesticular haematoma take its normal course, with the foreseeable and\n\nlikely result of bilateral atrophy if the dangerous intratesticular haematoma is not\n\nalleviated immediately. Whether or not, the whole set of testes can be saved is\n\nirrelevant. So long as there exists a reasonable chance of saving some portion of it, it\n\njustifies and mandates the operative step to surgically explore and drain the\n\nintratesticular haematomas, unless of course the patient himself, after being properly\n\ninformed, decides for himself that there is no necessity for such an invasive operative\n\nprocedure.422.    In a 1989 paper \"Blunt Scrotal Trauma:\n\nEmergency Department Evaluation and Management\", Munter and Faleski stated that:Blunt scrotal trauma can cause significant injuries which if not\n\n  correctly diagnosed and treated may result in profound morbidity, including loss of a\n\n  testicle…. Ultrasonography recently has become widely reported as a useful modality\n\n  in the evaluation of blunt scrotal trauma…423.    I would have thought therefore that any\n\nreasonably competent urologist should have realised the importance of using ultrasound to\n\ninvestigate a severe scrotal swelling particularly where the testes could not be palpated.\n\nIt is a breach of his duty of care simply to assume that there would not be any\n\nintratesticular haematoma, and hence, dispense with an ultrasound. I would regard that\n\nomission as one which any responsible and reasonably competent urologist in the shoes of\n\nDr Tan would not omit to do in the face of a scrotal swelling the size of a mango, with\n\nthe testes not palpable. Clearly, it was a poor exercise of medical and clinical judgment,\n\nwhich I do not expect of a responsible and competent urologist.424.    When the testes were not palpable through the\n\nscrotal haematoma, there is all the more reason to order an ultrasound to check for\n\nintratesticular haematoma, which Dr Tan as an experienced and competent urologist should\n\nhave known can be dangerous. His admission that he did palpate for the testicles to my\n\nmind indicates that he wanted to check for intratesticular haematoma. Otherwise, why\n\npalpate for the testicles in the first place? Dr Tan could not be heard to say that he did\n\nnot at that time realise the importance of checking for intratesticular haematoma.425.    In my opinion, the clinical examination,\n\ninvestigation and treatment by Dr Tan on 2 May 1997 were clearly not up to the appropriate\n\nstandard of post-operative treatment and care expected of a reasonably competent\n\nspecialist urologist. I also observe that Dr Tan failed to record in his clinical notes\n\nthe colour, shape or the size of the scrotal haematoma although he admitted that the size\n\nof the swelling, its colour, his inability to palpate the testicles, tenderness of the\n\nscrotum should all have been recorded. A lackadaisical attitude seems to have been taken\n\nby Dr Tan over contemporaneous recording of important and significant details of clinical\n\nobservations and findings. I note also the extremely brief operation notes kept by Dr Tan.\n\nReliance on pure memory for such matters is certainly not good medical practice.Record of ‘No pain’426.    Looking at the drugs prescribed, Dr Tan appears\n\nto have given the plaintiff strong drugs to resolve the inflammation. Dr Tan was\n\nquestioned why he had prescribed painkillers (i.e. Voltaren) when he asserted that the\n\nplaintiff had not experienced any pain, as stated in his entry ‘No pain’ in his\n\nclinical notes dated 2 May 1997. Interestingly in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Dr\n\nTan left out mentioning Voltaren from the list of medication he prescribed on 2 May 1997.427.    Dr Tan maintained that he gave Voltaren for\n\ninflammation, thereby suggesting that it was not prescribed because of the pain. When\n\nconfronted with the fact that he also prescribed Danzen, which is an anti-inflammatory\n\ndrug, he explained that he was using a ‘combination’ of anti-inflammatory drugs.428.    As a result of some exchange of letters between\n\nthe plaintiff’s and 1stdefendant’s solicitors over the question\n\nwhether the words ‘No pain’ in his clinical notes for 2 May 1997 were written\n\ncontemporaneously because of the different ink colour, Dr Tan conceded that the entry was\n\nlikely to be filled in later but he could not remember exactly when. Amazingly, Dr Tan\n\nsaid that it was even possible that he could have inserted the words ‘No pain’\n\njust before he submitted his report to the Singapore Medical Council but this would be\n\nabout 1 year and 3 to 4 months after his medical examination on 2 May 1997!429.    If so, this must have been inserted as an\n\nafterthought. It could hardly be regarded as anything close to a contemporaneous record of\n\nhis clinical findings on 2 May 1997.430.    When his counsel asked him whether the plaintiff\n\nsuffered any pain on 2 May 1997, his evidence was:A: Under oath, I cannot be sure that he specifically said that he was\n\n  not in pain. But I am sure that he did not say that he was in pain.…..Ct : Did you ask Mr Harte if he felt any pain on 2 May ’97?A : I believe I did.Ct : What was his answer?A : He must have said that it was not severe or nothing much at all.\n\n  The reason I say this is that as I mentioned earlier that the unusual things or the\n\n  abnormal things, or the specific things, or points raised to me, are things which I would\n\n  record as soon as I can. In general, normal things or non-events, are not recorded, and\n\n  this you can see from the rest of the notes which generally do not record normal findings.Ct : So therefore ‘No pain’ is not an abnormal finding?A : ‘No pain’ is what I consider a non-event. … ‘No\n\n  pain’ is a finding in relation to the haematoma, which should have been put in,\n\n  including other details like size, colour, any inability to palpate the testicles through\n\n  the haematoma and whether it was tender to palpate and the ensuing discussion on what to\n\n  do next and the treatment plan for haematoma. All this in retrospect should have been\n\n  included.431.    If it was a non-event, then why did he take all\n\nthe trouble later to insert ‘No pain’ to his clinical notes subsequently? If he\n\nfelt that the size, colour and inability to palpate as well as ‘No pain’ should\n\nhave been put in because they were all in relation to the haematoma, it is remarkable that\n\nhe should decide to insert only the words ‘No pain’ in his clinical notes but\n\nleave out the rest of the relevant details of the haematoma. Clearly, it was selective\n\ninsertion of relevant details by Dr Tan at work here.432.    What is most telling was the way he tried to\n\nexplain away the rather unusual phenomenon of swelling without pain. He said that in his\n\nexperience, he had seen several scrotal haematomas following operations like herniagraphy,\n\nvasectomy, orchidectomy, varicocelectomy where there is usually no pain in spite of the\n\nscrotal haematoma because these haematomas stretch the scrotal skin and they look more\n\nimpressive than they are actually painful. His diagnosis at that time was that Mr Harte\n\nhad a scrotal haematoma but he did not suspect that he had intratesticular haematoma. Dr\n\nTan then said:A: … In retrospect, after asking myself what happened to him, I\n\n  believe he had both types of haematoma [i.e. (a) scrotal haematoma or extratesticular\n\n  haematoma and (b) intratesticular haematoma].Ct : In which case would he have pain?A :Yes. He should have felt pain for the intratesticular\n\n  haematomas.Ct : So I ask you again, did the patient answer you that he felt\n\n  pain…., you did ask him the question if he felt any pain on 2 May ’97?A : I am relying on what I recollect on that day, and as I mentioned\n\n  earlier I can remember him walking through the door, still able to joke about his\n\n  condition – by saying he has got big balls. And as would be an automatic standard\n\n  question, I would have asked him about pain. And I remember that pain on that day was not\n\n  an issue. All I can recall is that he did not indicate to me that he was in severe pain.Ct : So he indicated to you that he was in some pain?A : No. He allowed me to examine him and I palpated the haematoma, and\n\n  it was not tender and I have no reason to suspect that what he had was nothing more than\n\n  the normal scrotal haematoma.Ct : For the last time, when you asked him whether he felt any pain,\n\n  what was his answer?A : His answer was ‘No’.Ct : So did you believe him?A : I have no reason not to believe him.433.    During this part of his evidence, Dr Tan was\n\nparticularly evasive. From the above evidence, I am inclined to believe that Dr Tan was\n\nnot truthful in his testimony. Obviously, Mr Harte must be suffering from a substantial\n\nintratesticular haematoma in both testes in order to suffer from bilateral testicular\n\natrophy in the first place. That intratesticular haematoma stretching the tunica albuginea\n\nmust be painful for Mr Harte. It is inherently incredible that Mr Harte, upon being\n\nquestioned by Dr Tan whether he felt any pain, would have answered the opposite of what he\n\nwas feeling at that time. I find as a fact that Mr Harte had complained of pain in his\n\nscrotum to Dr Tan on 2 May 1997.434.    The fact that Voltaren, a painkiller, had been\n\nprescribed corroborates the plaintiff’s evidence that he was in pain. In my judgment,\n\nDr Tan had lied that the plaintiff was not in pain on 2 May 1997. The words ‘No\n\npain’ were a fabrication inserted by Dr Tan to his clinical notes for reasons best\n\nknown to himself. Plaintiff’s counsel had submitted that the words were inserted just\n\nbefore Dr Tan’s reply to the Singapore Medical Council to explain the mishap.435.    Because of this false insertion of ‘No\n\npain’, Dr Tan had to tally up with his other story that he did not receive any phone\n\ncalls from Mr Harte prior to 2ndMay 1997 complaining of the pain and swelling.\n\nI did not believe Dr Tan that he had not received these calls. This brings me to my other\n\nfinding that his failure to instruct Mr Harte to come immediately to see him upon hearing\n\nthe plaintiff’s painful condition and swelling, knowing full well that a surgery had\n\nbeen performed and that the substantial swelling was extremely unusual, was something that\n\na responsible and reasonably competent urologist surgeon would not have done. Plainly, Dr\n\nTan had not taken sufficient care by asking the plaintiff to come for a medical check-up\n\nand he was dismissive of what the plaintiff had told him. He was overly confident that his\n\nsurgery had gone on well and hence, there was no need to call Mr Harte in to be seen\n\nimmediately despite all the complaints by Mr Harte on the telephone to him on the day\n\nafter the surgery.436.    Counsel for the plaintiff submitted that Dr Tan,\n\nhaving suspected that the operation had gone wrong, tried to cover up his tracks when he\n\nfinally saw Mr Harte on the 4thday after the surgery. Counsel for the\n\nplaintiff mentioned several instances of Dr Tan’s conduct from which a cover-up by Dr\n\nTan could be inferred, but I do not find it necessary to deal specifically with them.",
        "Trespass or battery": "437.    Having regard to my finding that the surgery was\n\nnot the cause of the damage, I need not address the question of trespass and battery. In\n\nmy opinion, this head of claim is unmeritorious and in any event, it was not pursued with\n\nany vigour by counsel for the plaintiff. The plaintiff had in fact signed a ‘Consent\n\nfor operation’ form for his bilateral varicocelectomy on 28 April 1997. Once there is\n\nconsent in law, which I find there was for the operation, the operation itself cannot\n\nconstitute trespass or battery.",
        "Vicarious liability of the 2nd defendants": "438.    The plaintiff did not dispute that Dr Tan runs a\n\nprivate medical practice at his own clinic. He was never employed by the hospital. In the\n\ncourse of the trial, counsel for the plaintiff clarified that the vicarious liability of\n\nthe 2nddefendants did not arise from employment but arose purely from an\n\nagency arrangement.439.    As I have found that Dr Tan’s negligence\n\nduring the surgery is not proven, the question of vicarious liability for the surgery\n\nperformed in the hospital does not even arise. The plaintiff’s claim against the\n\nhospital must necessarily fail. Since the hospital has been dragged in purely on that\n\nbasis, it may well have an impact on the question of legal costs, in particular whether Dr\n\nTan must bear any part of the hospital’s costs in defending the plaintiff’s\n\nsuit. For this reason, I will state my finding on vicarious liability.440.    Without going into the detailed reasons, it\n\nsuffices for me to say that Dr Tan was not an agent of the hospital. Neither had the\n\nhospital held out Dr Tan as its agent for the purpose of the surgery. The hospital merely\n\nsupplies hospital facilities and certain nursing care services to independent surgeons\n\n(including Dr Tan) who are free to choose any particular hospital where they have\n\nadmitting privileges to perform their surgery and treat their private patients. Gleneagles\n\nHospital has no control over how these independent surgeons privately treat and manage\n\ntheir own patients, even when the hospital facilities are being used.441.    I agree with counsel for the 2nddefendants that the hospital is not vicariously liable to the plaintiff for any alleged\n\nnegligent acts or omissions of Dr Tan, which have nothing to do with the hospital\n\nfacilities and nursing care services provided. Mr Harte sought out and contracted with Dr\n\nTan directly to treat his infertility and operate on him. He never sought those services\n\nfrom the hospital. Since the hospital never provided the services of a specialist surgeon\n\nto operate on Mr Harte, the hospital was not under any duty in law to see that the\n\nspecialist surgeon engaged by Mr Harte himself had exercised due care. That appears to me\n\nto be determinative of the issue of vicarious liability. If indeed there was any alleged\n\nprincipal and agency relationship, the principal party treating, managing and operating on\n\nMr Harte appears to me to be Dr Tan himself and not the hospital.",
        "Assessment of Damages": "442.    First, I shall determine the damages on the\n\nassumption that Dr Tan is liable for all the damage suffered by Mr Harte. Second, I shall\n\nassess the chance, as best as I can, of Dr Tan saving some parts of his testes had he\n\nasked Mr Harte to see him immediately on being told of the unusual swelling and pain on 29\n\nApril 1997 and treated him appropriately. The damages will then be discounted accordingly\n\non the basis that the degree of damage might have been far less catastrophic had Dr Tan\n\nnot been negligent post-operatively.(a) General Damages for pain and sufferingThe general damages for pain and suffering are assessed as follows:(a) Large haematoma untreated for 4 days- $ 2000(b) Complete loss of fertility for a 36 year old man who has been\n\n      sub-fertile for 9 years and has no children yet- $20,000(c) Partial penile impotence and impaired libido- $13,000(d) Atrophy and shrinkage of both testicles- $10,000(e) Increased risk of liver cancer from long term testosterone therapy and\n\n      an awareness of a shortened life span- $5,000TOTAL-S$50,000(b) Special DamagesExpenses already incurred may be divided into 4 categories:(a)    Medical expenses incurred before the operation(b)    Medical expenses incurred for the operation itself(c)    Local medical expenses incurred after the operation(d)    Overseas medical expenses incurred after the operation.443.    With my finding that Dr Tan was not negligent in\n\nhis operation, the medical expenses under (a) and (b) cannot be allowed. From the\n\nevidence, it appears that Mr Harte was reimbursed for most of these expenses by his\n\ninsurance company in New York.444.    Items (c) and (d) will be allowed in principle\n\nas they comprise expenses incurred after the post-operative negligence of Dr Tan. Since Mr\n\nHarte was on paid home leave, I consider it reasonable to seek advice and a second opinion\n\nfrom the doctors in New York, and in particular Dr Dubin who had treated him previously.445.    However, these expenses must be properly proved.\n\nThe legal burden is on the plaintiff to prove his special damages. But no supporting\n\ndocumentary evidence was tendered in court for most of his expenses listed in his\n\nstatement of claim. It is also unclear whether he has obtained full reimbursement. He said\n\n‘I have to check all my records. The way health insurance works in U.S., not\n\neverything is paid 100%. I certainly submitted the bills in the form of health claims and\n\nI was certainly reimbursed for those costs.’ When probed further, the plaintiff\n\nclarified that he had received reimbursement of 30 to 50 % of his total medical bill\n\nbecause there were deductions. From the statement of special damages served pursuant to\n\nOrder 18 Rule 12 (1A)(b) of the Rules of Court 1997, it appears that items (c) and (d)\n\ntotal S$ 4992.70 and US $4982.08.446.    Mr Lek for the 2nddefendants argued\n\nthat where there was reimbursement of those medical expenses by Mr Harte’s health\n\ninsurance provided either by the company or the Health Care Plan in the USA, Mr Harte\n\nsuffered no loss. As such, he could not submit a claim for damages in this suit as that\n\nwould be making a double claim. I disagree.i. Claims with reimbursement447.    A defendant tortfeasor has no valid defence to a\n\nclaim of damages from an insured and reimbursed employee plaintiff. Such an insured and\n\nreimbursed employee plaintiff has all the rights intact against the defendant tortfeasor.\n\nThe defendant tortfeasor’s liability to pay the plaintiff is not affected by any\n\nreimbursement that the plaintiff has obtained from his employer or insurance. After the\n\nplaintiff has received payment of the damages, it is a matter between him and his employer\n\nor insurance whether the monies earlier paid by his employer or insurance are to be\n\nrecovered. The right of subrogation is separate from the issue before me whether the\n\ndefendant tortfeasor must pay for the damages suffered by the plaintiff. It need not\n\nconcern the court here.448.    Medical expenses or health insurance policies\n\nare normally regarded as indemnity policies, and thus attract the right of subrogation.\n\nSubrogation applies to all insurance contracts, which are contracts of indemnity. The\n\ndoctrine of subrogation is of course, that the insured cannot make a profit from his loss\n\nand that for any profit he does make, he is accountable in equity to his insurer.449.    InNapier v Hunter[1993] 2 WLR 42 the\n\nHouse of Lords was unanimous in holding that insurers have an equitable interest in money\n\nreceived by the insured. The opinions contained reviews of the history of the doctrine of\n\nsubrogation, which indicate that at the very least, it developed in equity as well as at\n\ncommon law. The principles establish that the insurers have an enforceable equitable\n\ninterest in the damages payable by the tortfeasor.450.    The equitable interest of the insurers is to be\n\nsatisfied by saying that they have a lien or charge over the money in question, rather\n\nthan by saying that the money was impressed with a trust. Thus, if the insured who has\n\nreceived the money goes bankrupt, the insurers can recover the money in priority to the\n\nclaims of other unsecured creditors;Re Miller, Gibb & Co[1957] 1 WLR 703,\n\napproved by the House of Lords inNapier v Hunter.451.    As there is a clear listing of the\n\npost-operative medical expenses with full particulars given (see statement of special\n\ndamages), I do not think that there can be much dispute that they were in fact incurred\n\nalthough the supporting receipts were not produced. I do not think that I should penalise\n\nthe plaintiff and disallow his claim here simply because he had not produced the receipts\n\nperhaps because they were given to the insurance company or his company to obtain\n\nreimbursement, and hence were no longer available for production before me.452.    I therefore allow in full the expenses under\n\nitems (c) and (d) incurred after the operation, which totalS$ 4,992.70andUS\n\n$4,982.08respectively.ii. Air Fares for overseas treatment453.    No loss was suffered under items 1.3.1, 1.3.2\n\nand 1.5.1 in the statement of special damages because the plaintiff never incurred any\n\nexpenses for the return airfares. His employer paid for the airfares between New York and\n\nSingapore for his April and October 1998 trips, including his third trip in 1999, where he\n\ntook advantage of his home leave and a business trip to London, to seek medical\n\nconsultation in New York. These return trips were part of his perquisites under his\n\nemployment contract and were consumed principally either as his home leave or in the\n\ncourse of work for the company, and not because of the medical treatment which I regard as\n\nmerely incidental. Clearly, medical consultation was not the primary reason for those\n\ntrips back home to New York. I therefore disallow Mr Harte’s claim for airfares\n\namounting to a total of US$23,100, which should not be mounted at all as they stand on a\n\ncompletely different footing from the claim for his post-operative medical expenses for\n\nwhich he had been partially reimbursed.",
        "(c) Future Expenses": "I classify the future expenses into the following:(a)    Cost of fertility treatment comprising two\n\n  procedures viz TESE (testicular sperm extraction) and ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm\n\n  injection) at Cornell Medical Centre, New York. Microdissection TESE is the surgical\n\n  removal of sperm from the testes or epididymis under optical magnification. ICSI\n\n  encompasses the removal of ova (eggs) from the wife and then the laboratory injection of\n\n  sperm into each ovum for fertilisation.(b)    Loss of earnings having to return to a lower\n\n  paying job in New York because of the fertility treatment.(c)    Cost of hormone replacement therapy454.    I accept the principle that the plaintiff is not\n\nallowed to claim any expense that would have been incurred regardless of the tort of\n\nnegligence committed against him:Cutler v Vauxhall Motors Ltd[1970] 2 All ER 56.\n\nThe plaintiff there was not entitled to recover damages for the surgery, as there was a\n\nreasonable probability that even if he had not suffered the accident, he would not have\n\navoided the surgery for the severe varicose veins present in his legs even before the\n\naccident. The court is therefore required to have regard to contingencies and their\n\nprobabilities when assessing the future expenses flowing from the tortuous act.i. Cost of fertility treatment455.    The plaintiff had a pre-existing condition of\n\npoor sperm quality even before he consulted Dr Tan. Despite trying for 3 years, the wife\n\ncould not conceive naturally. By then, she was 36 years of age. Apparently the poor\n\nfertility of Mr Harte was compounded by some medical problems on Mrs Harte’s part.\n\nShe herself had a small cyst in her left ovary and it was explained to her by Dr Jones\n\nthat she would have irregular menses.456.    Dr Dubin himself advised the couple to consider\n\nIVF should his left varicocelectomy prove to be unsuccessful. Dr Dubin’s left\n\nvaricocelectomy operation did not help much. After the atrophy, Dr Dubin advised Mr Harte\n\nin April 1998 to consider other options like donor insemination or adoption. He repeated\n\nthat advice on 27 October 1999. These to me are more realistic options.457.    A/Prof Li Man Kay testified that ICSI -\n\n‘Intracytoplasmic Sperm Insertion’ would have been the recommended method of\n\nfertility treatment for the couple,even beforethe bilateral\n\nvaricocelectomy because the plaintiff had weak sperm and the chances that his sperm would\n\nbe able to penetrate the egg would be very low. Artificial insemination by injection of\n\nsperm into the vagina and uterus and the test-tube baby method (where the egg would be\n\nmixed with the sperms in a test-tube) were both not viable in Mr Harte’s case.458.    Dr Schlegel said that he would have recommended\n\nintrauterine insemination or in vitro fertilisation (although he later said that he would\n\nonly have recommended sperm washing with medication for stimulation of the female partner\n\nto produce eggs). This procedure of sperm washing and stimulation of the woman would cost\n\nbetween US$300 to US$2000. It would take typically 2 to 3 attempts for a couple to achieve\n\na pregnancy, therefore costing a total between US$600 to US$9,000. For in vitro\n\nfertilisation, Dr Schlegel said that the cost would be approximately US $13,000 per\n\nattempt. Whereas in the case of the TESE and ICSI, the total cost for each attempt is\n\nUS$28,000, of which US$16,000 is for the ICSI and all portions of the in vitro\n\nfertilisation, US$4,000 is for hospital fees, $1,000 for anaesthesia and approximately\n\nUS$7,000 is for testicular sperm extraction or the TESE component.459.    Dr Notley also said that if he had been Mr\n\nHarte, he would have tried intracytoplasmic sperm injection (i.e. ICSI).460.    Based on the above evidence, it is most probable\n\nthat Mrs Harte will have to undergo an ICSI procedure in any case. Even with sperm\n\nwashing, his weak sperms will not likely fertilize his wife’s eggs. His inability all\n\nthese years to impregnate his wife is testimony to the fact that his sperms simply have no\n\nability to do what they are supposed to do. Any concentration by centrifuging the sperms\n\nand making them more concentrated is not going to make much difference in my opinion.\n\nHence, the ICSI procedure will still be needed even if Mr Harte did not suffer any\n\ntesticular atrophy.461.    Hence, based on the principle stated inCutler\n\nv Vauxhall Motors Ltd,I do not think that the cost of his wife’s ICSI procedure\n\nshould be included as part of the damages as it is not an expense that could be avoided at\n\nall.462.    As Mr Harte has returned to his hometown in New\n\nYork, it seems reasonable that he seeks treatment from Dr Schlegel, who now advocates the\n\nmicrodissection TESE and ICSI procedure. There is some scepticism whether the\n\nmicrodissection procedure is more effective than the standard TESE/ICSI procedure.\n\nHowever, the couple firmly believes that Mr Harte’s condition necessitates the\n\nspecial treatment by Dr Schlegel. I do not think they can be faulted if they pin their\n\nhopes desperately on him. Given these circumstances, the comparatively cheaper cost of\n\nalternative or similar treatment in Singapore is beside the point.463.    Dr Fong Yang had testified that frozen sperm\n\ncould be stored indefinitely without any degradation in the sperm quality. This also\n\navoids the problem of degradation of sperm quality with age and the risk of multiple\n\ntesticular operations to remove testicular tissue to obtain fresh sperm each time.464.    In the paper ‘Physiological consequences\n\nof testicular sperm extraction’by Peter Schlegel and Li-Ming Su, the risk of\n\npermanent devascularisation of the testicle whenever a TESE surgery is performed is\n\nrecognised. The authors said:In addition to the transient effects of a biopsy on spermatogenesis,\n\n  permanent devascularization of testis may occur after TESE procedures. …we postulate\n\n  that multiple incisions in the tunica albuginea used to retrieve spermatozoa may result in\n\n  interruption of a sufficient proportion of testicular arteries to devascularize the\n\n  testis. Therefore,avoiding multiple incisions in the tunica albuginea as well as\n\n  minimizing repeated TESE attempts is important to avoid the risk of permanent ischaemic\n\n  testicular injury from TESE.…….We also recommend that at least 6 months elapse before a repeat TESE\n\n  procedure is performed.The banking of frozen testicular tissue or spermatozoa\n\n  retrieved during TESE procedures is advised to decrease the need for repeat TESE attempts\n\n  and minimize injury to the testis.\"465.    However, the plaintiff inflated his claim by\n\ncomputing damages based on 10 cycles of TESE/ICSI. In answer to the request for further\n\nand better particulars, the following reasons were given for requiring as many as 10\n\nattempts:(a)    The treatment involves the extraction of sperm\n\n  material from the left testis for storage of the same and subsequent use of the same to\n\n  fertilise an egg to be extracted from the plaintiff’s wife.(b)    Dr Schlegel and his medical team utilise a\n\n  surgical technique that enables multiple attempts to be made at extracting sperm material\n\n  from the left testis.a.    Even though viable sperm material may be extracted\n\n    successfully on each attempt, the said sperm material may not successfully fertilise the\n\n    egg obtained from the plaintiff’s wife. In such an instance, the extraction process\n\n    will have to be repeated --b.    Until a successful fertilisation takes place orc.    Until no further sperm material can be found ord.    Until no further eggs can be extracted from the\n\n    plaintiff’s wife.466.    Nowhere was it stated that the 10 cycles were\n\nrequired because Mr and Mrs Harte wanted to have a big family because they liked children\n\nvery much. To my mind, that evidence in court was an afterthought to bolster their\n\nevidence that 10 cycles were needed. With Mrs Harte already at 38 years of age, I believe\n\nthat there is a limit to the number of pregnancies that she can safely have. There is also\n\na risk that multiple incisions on the tunica albuginea as well as repeated TESE attempts\n\nmay cause permanent ischaemic testicular injury.467.    Considerable difficulties lay ahead for the\n\ncouple as shown by their first attempt in June 2000 in the Cornell University Centre for\n\nReproductive Medicine and Infertility. Mrs Harte failed to produce sufficient mature eggs.\n\nShe produced only 4 follicles (immature eggs). The whole procedure had to be called off.\n\nWhether this expensive method is going to work at all for Mr and Mrs Harte is unclear.468.    Dr Schlegel has testified that if he fails on\n\nhis first attempt to find any sperm, he will not make any further attempts. Dr\n\nDubin’s own opinion is extremely guarded for the procedure advocated by Dr Goldstein\n\nand Dr Schlegel.469.    Given these problems, I am already very generous\n\nto allow 3 cycles of the invasive TESE procedure to obtain sperm for the ICSI procedure,\n\nwhich is as far as I can reasonably go. Unused sperms should be frozen for future use as\n\nstated by Dr Schlegel in his own paper instead of resorting to too many expensive TESE\n\noperations with their attendant and not inconsiderable risks.470.    I will use Dr Schlegel’s estimate that the\n\nTESE component of his advocated procedure costs approximately US$7,000. 3 cycles thus add\n\nup to US$21,000 plus an estimate of US $4,500 for the use of frozen-thawed sperms for any\n\nattempts in between or thereafter. Since there will be further pain and suffering and\n\ninconvenience from these 3 operations, I award a further US$1,500 x 3 for Mr Harte’s\n\npain, suffering and inconvenience during the TESE operations. Total award here is thusUS$30,000.ii. Loss of Earnings471.    Mr Harte testified that he gave up his job in\n\nSingapore and returned to New York strictly for medical treatment. They decided to leave\n\nSingapore after they found out about Dr Schlegel and his team. After some research, they\n\nbelieved that they would have a reasonable chance of having children of their own using\n\nthe microdissection TESE–ICSI method practised by Dr Schlegel. Clearly, Mr Harte\n\nwanted to portray an impression that he was forced to leave his well paid job behind and\n\nleave Singapore because they badly wanted to get treatment from the best medical centre\n\nfor the TESE-ICSI procedure at Cornell University Medical Centre in order to have their\n\nchildren of their own. So they decided to return to New York.472.    Mr Lek rightly pointed out that the plaintiff\n\ndid not act on any reliable medical advice before deciding to undergo fertility treatment\n\nin New York. The decision to leave Singapore was madeeven beforeany consultation\n\nwith Dr Schlegel.473.    Mrs Harte testified that they decided to leave\n\nSingapore after they obtained the biopsy result of 21 October 1998 from the Cabrini\n\nMedical Centre. She did not relate that decision to the need to seek medical treatment in\n\nNew York. In her affidavit, she said that the full extent of her husband’s injury\n\nonly became apparent in October 1997. It left her sorely depressed. She found herself\n\ncrying uncontrollably every day without warning. She started to hate Singapore and\n\nanything associated with it. She rarely left her house. She also admitted that she wanted\n\nto leave Singapore. Her bad feelings about Singapore would have set in by\n\nSeptember/October 1997. In fact, Dr Tan informed them that Mr Harte would not be able to\n\nfather a child on 11 October 1997. Given her strong feelings against staying on in\n\nSingapore and that the plaintiff was a person who would respect and give consideration to\n\nher wishes, it is not likely in my opinion that the plaintiff would have extended his\n\ncontract to stay on in Singapore.474.    In all probability, the plaintiff and his wife\n\nhad already decided to leave Singapore because they felt that Dr Tan’s surgery was\n\nsolely responsible for the bilateral atrophy. As a consequence of my finding, the basis\n\nfor that belief has turned out to be erroneous. Should I award damages founded on a course\n\nof action flowing from the wrong basis? Perhaps I should not.475.    Most importantly, they decided to leave\n\nSingapore even before consulting Dr Schlegel. They had not even planned or decided how\n\nthey were going to afford the fertility treatments.476.    The documents of E D & F Man show that the\n\nplaintiff was ‘assigned’ or ‘seconded’ by his employers, E D &F\n\nMan Inc, to E D & F Man Cocoa (Singapore) Pte Ltd for only a period of 3 years\n\ncommencing on 1 August 1996 and after which period, it was stipulated that the Plaintiff\n\nwould have to return to the US. Mr Trevor Johnson could not recall if there was any\n\ndocumentation showing that the plaintiff was to be employed in Singapore for longer than 3\n\nyears.477.    Mr Johnson confirmed that he never made any\n\nformal recommendation to the management committee of the cocoa division that the plaintiff\n\nwas to succeed him.478.    If as the plaintiff claimed that they ‘only\n\ndecided to leave Singapore after [they] found out about Dr Schlegel and his team’,\n\nthis would have been at the earliest sometime after Dr Dubin’s letter to the\n\nplaintiff dated 27 October 1999, wherein Dr Dubin suggested that Mr Harte might wish to\n\nconsult with Drs. Goldstein and Schlegel at the New York Hospital, who had reported being\n\nable to remove sperm such as his and together with ICSI, achieve embryos and pregnancies.479.    There should have been some documentary evidence\n\nin E D & F Man of an extension of the plaintiff’s contract to stay on but there\n\nwas none. His 3 year term ended on 31 July 1999. Instead, Mr Johnson said that he had\n\nalready recruited the plaintiff’s replacement (Mr Paul Hutchinson) from London, who\n\njoined E D & F Man (Singapore) in July 1999, which meant that he would have looked for\n\na replacement even before that date. The plaintiff was obviously lying in this regard.480.    At the end of his 3 years’ secondment (plus\n\na few more months to help his successor acquaint himself with his job), the plaintiff left\n\nfor home as was the arrangement. A Form IR21 dated 15 November 1999, which E D & F Man\n\nAsia Pte Ltd submitted to the Comptroller of Income Tax (P12), stated the \"Reason for\n\nCessation/Departure\" as \"CONTRACT EXPIRED\". It is pertinent to note that\n\nhis employer E D & F Man was also having some ownership changes and restructuring at\n\nthat time. The divestment exercise of the agricultural part of the business resulted in\n\nsome headcount reduction in the sugar trading office in Singapore although Mr Harte\n\nmaintained that there was no reduction in the cocoa trading office where he worked.481.    If indeed his company wanted to extend his\n\ncontract, he could easily have stayed on in Singapore and still have his TESE done in New\n\nYork. I do not think his work would suffer on account of perhaps a short trip of about a\n\nweek a year to New York just for his TESE. It could also be timed to coincide with his\n\nhome leave, which could be extended by a week if Mr Harte were to be so calculative about\n\nhis leave. Given the speed and ready availability of air travel today, I do not think that\n\nit would be so inconvenient to undergo day surgery treatment in New York for his part of\n\nthe TESE, and thereafter to fly back.482.    Clearly the fertility treatment sought in New\n\nYork would not require him and his wife to be stationed permanently in New York. Dr Fong\n\nYang and A/Prof Li confirmed that both the TESE and ICSI are day surgeries. The male\n\npatient’s presence is required for only 1 day and the female patient is required for\n\na period of 3 to 4 days according to Dr Fong Yang. The pre-operative medicine obviously\n\ncan be taken in Singapore if Mr Harte were to be based in Singapore.483.    According to Dr Schlegel, the plaintiff would be\n\nrequired in New York for only about a week (of which he would have to be available one or\n\ntwo days beforehand because of the uncertainty of the timing of the ovulation, then he\n\nwould stay in hospital for approximately one day for the actual TESE procedure and another\n\nthree or four days for convalescence). Mrs Harte on the other hand would have to be in New\n\nYork for about 3 to 4 weeks for the ICSI procedure. She would be treated with hormones for\n\nabout 2 weeks and monitored for multiple egg production. After retrieval of her eggs, the\n\nsperm extracted from Mr Harte using the TESE procedure would then be injected into them. 3\n\ndays later, the fertilised embryos would be transferred back to her and she would need to\n\nstay in the hospital for several days to a week for additional monitoring. All this would\n\nadd up to about 3 to 4 weeks in New York for her. But Mrs Harte, who was not working in\n\nSingapore at that time, should have no difficulty staying 3 to 4 weeks in New York if the\n\nneed arose. I did not consider the time needed for the TESE-ICSI procedure to be so\n\nextravagant that Mr Harte could not hold his job in Singapore whilst undergoing this\n\nfertility treatment by Dr Schlegel in New York.484.    Given the risks of the procedure, Dr Schlegel\n\nfurther said that the procedure should only be repeated not more than once every 6 months.\n\nSince I am allowing only 3 procedures as a reasonable number, it is certainly not going to\n\nbe disruptive at all. Surely the day surgery TESE procedure for Mr Harte can be fitted\n\nwithin his annual home leave of 25 days per year (and extended if necessary) if he really\n\nwants to continue working in Singapore.485.    I do not believe at all that the need for\n\nfertility treatment by Dr Schlegel was his sole or main reason to return to New York. He\n\nhas not proved on a balance of probability that he would have been able to stay on in\n\nSingapore for the long term but for his need for fertility treatment in New York.486.    In conclusion, I cannot accept that the TESE\n\ntreatment at Cornell would be so disruptive that Mr Harte is forced to give up his job in\n\nSingapore. I do not find any cogent reason to justify the drastic measure by Mr Harte of\n\nleaving a well paid job in Singapore for a much lower paying job in New York. Some\n\ninconvenience there may be, having to go to New York each time for the TESE. But that is\n\nnot a sufficient reason. The plaintiff always has a duty to mitigate his loss. Instead of\n\ntrying to mitigate the loss, the plaintiff here increased his alleged loss without good\n\nreason, if indeed the decision to resign from his position in Singapore was wholly his\n\n(which I do not believe was the case in any event), and not because his services in\n\nSingapore were no longer needed by the company after the expiry of his contract (which I\n\nbelieve was more likely the case).487.    In fact, I regard his resignation to take up a\n\nlower paying job in New York so that he could go for a few day surgeries (spread out\n\nperhaps over 2 or 3 years) as most unreasonable. I cannot allow his loss of salary to be\n\nborne by the 1stdefendant. The plaintiff has to live with his own decision.488.    I thus reject Mr Harte’s claim for his\n\nalleged loss of earning amounting to S$2.4 million.iii. Cost of hormone replacement therapy489.    Mr Harte further claimed the cost of hormone\n\nreplacement therapy in New York at US$525 per month for 45 years based on a projected life\n\nspan of 78 years. Dr Futterwie did not testify to these expenses, which the plaintiff\n\ncomputed at US$283,500.490.    The cost of US$525 includes consultation and\n\nblood test every month, presumably to monitor for any development of liver cancer as a\n\nresult of the hormone therapy. The actual cost of the ‘testoderm’ drug is\n\nUS$118.49 per month.491.    Dr Jimmy Beng stated that Mr Harte would have to\n\nbe closely monitored with liver function tests but there was no hard and fast rule. In my\n\nopinion, that monthly consultation (US$246.60 per consultation) and blood test (US$160 per\n\ntest) is extravagant. Two blood tests and consultations a year will be more than\n\nsufficient for close monitoring having regard to the low incidence of liver cancer from\n\nsuch therapy. Therefore, I allow a total cost of US$1,828.48 p.a. under this head of\n\nclaim.492.    Mr Lek highlighted Dr Lei Chang Moh’s\n\ntestimony that some men around the ages of 50 and 60 might require hormone replacement\n\ntherapy in any event.493.    Taking that into account together with the other\n\ncontingencies of life (e.g. death though illness and accidents), it may be appropriate to\n\ncompute on the basis of therapy up to 60 years. Capitalising the US$1828.48 p.a.\n\nexpenditure running for a 24 year period (as Mr Harte is presently 36 years of age) at a\n\ndiscount rate of 5% p.a. (based on an estimate of future long term bank interest rates in\n\nthe United States), the lump sum payment when mathematically computed comes to US$25,230,\n\nwhich I shall round up toUS$26,000.If one wants to look at the calculation\n\nfrom the ‘multiplier’ basis, then in effect the multiplier is 14.2 if the lump\n\nsum is US$26,000. One cannot use a straight multiplication (based on 24 x US$1,828.48 =\n\nUS$43,883) because that fails to take account of the accelerated payment of a lump sum at\n\npresent value.",
        "(d) Likelihood of testicular salvage if treatment had been prompt": "494.    It is extremely difficult to estimate the\n\nprobability of testicular salvage if Dr Tan had seen Mr Harte promptly on the morning\n\nfollowing the surgery.495.    Suppose Dr Tan had asked him to come by his\n\nclinic the next day after the surgery upon receipt of Mr Harte’s telephone calls.\n\nSuppose Dr Tan ordered a CDUS immediately. It would still be several hours after 9.00 am\n\non the following morning before the CDUS results could be obtained. Counsel for Dr Tan\n\nsubmitted that by then, more than 24 hours would have elapsed after the fall. The\n\ntesticles would still have atrophied. Any post-operative negligence would not have\n\nresulted in more damage than would be the case without any post-operative negligence.\n\nSince no damage had arisen from Dr Tan’s breach of his duty of care, no damage was\n\npayable. Hence, Dr Tan would not be liable for any post-operative negligence.496.    Dr Myinte Soe relied on the following:(a) Dr Schlegel testified that beyond 4 to 6 hours, permanent injury\n\n  would set in for torsion injury. [My comment: As this was not with reference to contusion\n\n  injury, I disregarded it.](b) Dr Clarence Lei felt that the testicle would be dead in 2 hours\n\n  with no blood supply. [My comment: This is not quite the same for contusion injury, where\n\n  some blood supply may still be continuing after the contusion.](c) Dr Tay Kah Phuan felt that if there wasseveretrauma\n\n  causing tissue death, nothing much could be done. The tissue takes time to die but it will\n\n  die. [My comment: Dr Tay appears to me to be much too pessimistic. In any event, his is\n\n  based on severe trauma which is not so in our case of moderate trauma, where some tissues\n\n  left uncontused might well be salvageable.](d) Dr Notley also did not appear hopeful. He said that not much could\n\n  be done to save the testes disrupted by contusion. He said that one could operate on the\n\n  testes to reduce the damaging pressure buildup and then hope for the best. [My comment:\n\n  There is at least some hope.]497.    Fournier, Laing and Mc Aninch in their paper\n\n\"Scrotal Ultrasonography and the Management of Testicular Trauma\"\n\nreferred to a report by Del Villar, Ireland and Cass: Early exploration following trauma\n\nto the testicle. A failure rate of 45 % was reported for non-operative management based on\n\na review of 20 years’ experience. Additionally, 45 % of those patients in whom\n\nsurgical exploration was delayed required removal of the testes as opposed to only 5 % of\n\npatients who underwent exploration within 3 days of the injury. The results of this study\n\nindicate that the views expressed by the abovementioned experts might be far too\n\npessimistic. In the absence of other evidence and data, I can only use those results in\n\nthat paper as a rough guide to assess the probable success rate in our case.498.    Prof Li provided an educated guess that there\n\ncould be a 50% chance of saving Mr Harte’s testes had he been managed from the day\n\nafter the operation and perhaps with surgical exploration. Dr Tan could have immediately\n\ndrained the scrotum to relieve the pressure from the extratesticular swelling, which was\n\nfurther compressing the already distended and taut testes. He could perhaps have gone\n\nfurther by cutting the tunica albuginea to release some of the pent up pressure built up\n\nwithin the testes from the intratesticular haematoma. Thus had he called Mr Harte to his\n\nclinic immediately on 29 April 1997 instead of delaying by 4 days to 2 May 1997, I think\n\nthere would have been a fairly good chance of saving some amount of testicular tissue. Mr\n\nHarte would probably not suffer the degree of damage he has now suffered due to lack of\n\nproper treatment and post-operative care from Dr Tan. With such a large swelling, time\n\nmust surely be of the essence.499.    Under the circumstances, I will say that with\n\nprompt intervention by Dr Tan on the morning after the surgery, perhaps 60% of Mr\n\nHarte’s testes may be saved from atrophy, bearing in mind that even today, Mr\n\nHarte’s testes are not completely dead. Accordingly, I award him 60% of the damages\n\ncomputed above.500.    Since damage arising from Dr Tan’s breach\n\nof his duty of post-operative care of Mr Harte has been established, the plaintiff has\n\ntherefore succeeded in proving that Dr Tan has been negligent in his post-operative care.\n\nHowever, the plaintiff has failed to prove that Dr Tan was negligent in his bilateral\n\nvaricocele operation.",
        "Judgment Sums, Interest and Costs": "501.    The judgment sums are as follows:(a) 60 % of General Damages of S$50,000 = S$30,000.00(b) 60% of Special Damages of S$4,992.70 = S$ 2,995.62(c) 60% of Special Damages of US$4,982.08 =US$ 2,989.25(d) 60% of Future Fertility Treatment cost of US$30,000 =US$18,000.00(e) 60% of Future Hormone Therapy cost of US$26,000 =US$15,600.00502.    The total judgment sum awarded is S$32,995.62\n\nand US$36,589.25. In Singapore dollars, the total awarded is approximately S$96,660 using\n\nthe exchange rate of S$1.74 to US$1.503.    Interest is awarded on the general and special\n\ndamages at 3% p.a. for the amounts in Singapore dollars and at 5% p.a. for the amounts in\n\nUS dollars from the date of writ to date of judgment. No interest is allowed on the sums\n\nfor future loss. The usual statutory interest on judgment sums unpaid shall apply.504.    I will hear the parties on costs on the basis\n\nthat the plaintiff’s claim against Dr Tan is allowed but the plaintiff’s claim\n\nagainst the hospital is dismissed.Chan Seng OonJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
