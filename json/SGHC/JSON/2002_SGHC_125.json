        "GROUNDS OF DECISION": "1. On 5 April 2002, I gave judgment in favour of the\n\nplaintiffs in respect of their claim against the defendants for damages arising out of the negligent\n\nrepair of the engine of the plaintiffs vesselNur Marina. The parties subsequently\n\nappeared before me on the issue of quantum and this supplemental judgment relates to those\n\narguments.2. In the statement of claim, the plaintiffs claimed the following\n\nas damages:(1) repair costs in the sum of $628,277.25;(2) expenses incurred being:(i) $2,543 for survey fees and investigations;(ii) $28,000 for towing costs;(iii) RM40,099 for additional wages and other expenses;(3) loss of profits while the vessel was being\n\n    repaired.At the start of the trial the plaintiffs dropped their\n\n  claim for loss of profits. I therefore have to deal only with items (1) and (2).Expenses3. I will deal first with the claim for expenses. The first item,\n\nthe sum of $2,543, was an amount paid to the Salvage Association for inspecting the vessel and\n\ncarrying out investigations to ascertain the nature and cause of the damage to the engine. The\n\nSalvage Association was appointed to carry out this work by the vessels insurers. The plaintiffs\n\ndid not appoint it. The insurers were interested in ascertaining the cause of the damage so that\n\nthey could determine whether the loss was covered by their policy of insurance. In my judgment, this\n\namount was not an expense incurred by the plaintiffs as a result of the damage and therefore they\n\ncannot claim it from the defendants.4. The second item, the towage costs of $28,000 was, on the other\n\nhand, a direct result of the damage to the engine. The engine was so badly damaged that the vessel\n\ncould not sail under its own steam from Kuantan, the port of refuge, to Singapore for permanent\n\nrepairs to the engine. It had to be towed here and the plaintiffs had no choice but to incur the\n\ntowage expenses. They are entitled to recover the same.5. The third item, a sum of RM40,099 is made up of several\n\nseparate sub-items. First, the plaintiffs paid the chief engineer of the vessel a sum of RM10,000\n\nfor himself and the engine room crew for carrying out emergency repairs to the vessel on 21 March\n\n1995 and 25 March 1995. The plaintiffs did not, however, produce any evidence of a legal obligation\n\nto make such payments. The chief engineer and the engine room crew were employed on board the vessel\n\nand it was part of their duties to maintain the engine and effect minor repairs. No document was\n\nproduced showing that they were entitled to extra payments for major or emergency repairs. The\n\ndefendants submitted, and I agree, that this was a voluntary payment that cannot be recovered.6. The second component of the RM40,099 claim was a claim for\n\nRM11,500 representing the cost of hiring a speed boat to carry the plaintiffs technical\n\nsuperintendent from Kuantan to the vessel during the two periods when the vessels engine broke\n\ndown. The vessel was apparently some 20 miles outside the port. There was no bill evidencing this\n\nitem and the only documentation adduced to support it were two internal vouchers produced by the\n\nvessels managers in respect of payments they had made to the technical superintendent. As there\n\nwas no proof that this item was actually incurred by the superintendent, I cannot allow it.7. The third component comprised payments made to the\n\nsuperintendent as subsistence allowance, mileage allowance and hotel charges for his two visits to\n\nKuantan. These totalled RM2,423.50. Again the only evidence of these payments were the managers\n\ninternal vouchers. No contract setting out the terms of the subsistence allowance and the mileage\n\nallowance was produced. Nor were any hotel bills adduced. Accordingly, this claim is disallowed.8. The last component is the sum of RM16,176 that the plaintiffs\n\npaid for some 4,000 litres of lubricating oil for the engine. The defendants objection to this\n\nitem is that the plaintiffs had decided that they would change the vessels lubricating oil when\n\nthe vessel returned from Haiphong. Accordingly, they would have incurred this expense even if the\n\nengine had not broken down. I agree. This amount cannot be claimed.Repair costs9. The repair costs are made up of two bills from Wartsila Diesel\n\n(Singapore) Pte Ltd (Wartsila), the manufacturers of the engine. They carried out the repairs\n\nafter the breakdowns. Their first bill is for the sum of $185,909.95 and covers repairs/inspections\n\nof the main engine by service engineers at Kuantan from 27 March to 1 April 1995 and provision of\n\nlabour, floating crane hire and boat hire for permanent repairs at Singapore. The second bill in the\n\nsum of $446,768.30 covers the supply of replacement parts to the engine. In respect of the first\n\nbill, the defendants raised objections to items totalling $57,918.25 and in respect of the second\n\nbill, they raised objections to items totalling $55,199.37. Their position was that either these\n\nitems were excessive or that they could not be attributed to the damage arising from the defendants\n\nnegligence.10. In response, the plaintiffs relied on the evidence of Mr\n\nMichael Christopher Thompson, the surveyor from the Salvage Association, who was sent by the hull\n\nunderwriters of the vessel to establish the cause of the damage and ascertain the repairs required.\n\nIn his report dated 3 May 1995, Mr Thompson set out the recommended repairs effected and the repair\n\ncosts. He referred specifically to the two invoices that Wartsila had rendered and stated that these\n\ninvoices had been approved as being fair and reasonable for the work carried out and that such work\n\nwas attributable to the casualty under review. Subsequently, the Salvage Association approved the\n\ninvoices for payment and the underwriters paid the same.11. One of the objections that was raised related to the temporary\n\nrepairs done in Kuantan. At that stage, the no. 3 piston bearing was replaced and a new piston\n\nassembly was put in. Subsequently, after the second breakdown, these new parts were found to be\n\ndamaged as well. The defendants argued that repairs of the new parts could not be claimed against\n\nthem because there was no evidence that the damage arose from their negligence. Mr Thompson,\n\nhowever, who was aware of both the temporary and permanent repairs, was satisfied that these repairs\n\nwere also part of the damage arising from the negligent work of the defendants. He was not\n\nquestioned about how the subsequent damage to the new no. 3 piston and its accessories could have\n\narisen from the defendants negligence. Accordingly, I think it is too late for the defendants to\n\nraise this point now.12. I will deal first with the bill for the replacement parts that\n\ncame to $446,768.30. Item no. 8 of this bill was $9,370.25 being the cost of replacing six sets of\n\npiston rings. There was no evidence that all the piston rings were damaged. According to Wartsilas\n\nreport AB117, only pistons nos. 4 and 6 were renewed and the rest of the pistons were reused after\n\nservicing. The defendants submitted that the plaintiffs thus should only have claimed the cost of\n\ntwo sets of piston rings. That would have amounted to $3,123.42 ie $6,246.83 less than they claimed.\n\nIn Mr Thompsons report, however, it is stated that the pistons were re-ringed and he went on to\n\ninclude this work as part of the permanent repairs. He also said that the rings were attributable to\n\nthe casualty. That being the case, I find the defendants must pay for it.13. Item 16 on the bill was $14,165.45 for a complete set of\n\npacking/locking materials. The plaintiffs did not show what those items were for and how the supply\n\nof the same was attributable to the defendants default. Mr Thompsons report did not mention\n\nthis item at all. I disallow the amount.14. The defendants objected to the cost of $1,039.45 charged for\n\nthe lubricating oil filter elements replaced by Wartsila on the basis that these elements were\n\nlocated outside the engine and their replacement was not attributable to the defendants work. Mr\n\nThompson, however, made specific reference to the lubricating oil filter elements as replacement\n\nparts supplied on board the vessel in his report under the heading Recommended Repairs Effected.\n\nAccordingly, I allow this item. The same response is applicable to the defendants objection to\n\nitem no. 10 that was the cost of $750.60 for replacement of the lubricating oil cooler kit. This was\n\nanother item specifically mentioned by Mr Thompson under that heading.15. I next turn to Wartsilas invoice for $185,909.95. I am\n\nsatisfied that most of the defendants objections have no substance in view of Mr Thompsons\n\nreport. One item for $8,022.60 was in respect of the replacement of the turbocharger kit. The\n\ndefendants submitted that there was no evidence that this item was damaged. In Mr Thompsons\n\nreport, the only reference to the turbocharger was that its bearings were suspect because the\n\nturbocharger lubricating system was common with the main engine system. The turbocharger bearings\n\ntherefore had to be checked. Whilst the turbocharger itself had to be removed, checked and cleaned,\n\naccording to Mr Thompsons report, he did not state that the turbocharger itself required\n\nreplacement. Accordingly, I disallow this item.16. There was also an item for $2,546 in respect of the\n\nsupply of the cylindrical bearings set for the lubricating oil pump and drive box. The defendants\n\nobjected on the basis that the lubricating oil pump was located at the lower part of the engine and\n\nwould not be affected by the improper fitting of the connecting rods. Mr Thompsons report does\n\nnot mention this item. I disallow it.17. On this part of the claim, therefore, I have disallowed items\n\ntotalling $24,734.05. The plaintiffs claims for repairs is therefore reduced to $607,944.20.Conclusion18. In the result, I award the plaintiffs damages of $28,000 being\n\nthe cost of towage services and $607,944.20 being the cost of repairs together with interest thereon\n\nat 6% p.a. from the date my first judgment in this action ie 5 April 2002.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPOREThis does not merit reportingCopyright © Government of Singapore."
