        "Introduction": "The applicant had earlier pleaded guilty to a total of four\n\ncharges. They were for driving whilst under disqualification, an offence under s 43(4) of the Road\n\nTraffic Act (Cap 276), driving whilst not being covered by insurance, an offence under s 3(1) of the\n\nMotor Vehicles (Third Party Risks & Compensation) Act (Cap 189), failure to wear a seat belt\n\nwhilst driving, an offence under Rule 4(1) of the Road Traffic (Motor Vehicles, Wearing of Seat\n\nBelts) Rules, and for speeding, an offence under s 63(4) of the Road Traffic Act.2 He was sentenced on 30 April 2001, to a total of eight months imprisonment,\n\nand a total of 18 years disqualification for all classes of vehicles, a total fine of $1,000, in\n\ndefault, ten days imprisonment. The appeal against the sentences of imprisonment and\n\ndisqualification before this Court was dismissed on 2 August 2001. Counsel for the applicant,\n\nimmediately after the dismissal, sought for an order that the applicant commence serving his\n\nsentence of imprisonment on 16 August 2001, so that the appellant could have a period of two weeks\n\nto settle his personal and work affairs. I granted it and also ordered that the applicants bail\n\nbe extended.3 This Motion, filed on 16 August 2001, and heard on 17 August 2001, was for a\n\nfurther order that the applicants sentence of imprisonment which was to commence on 16 August\n\n2001, be postponed instead to commence on 30 August 2001. The applicant cited in his affidavit, that\n\nhe needed a further two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs, before serving his sentence.4 The applicant was seeking, in essence, an alteration of my order of 2 August\n\n2001 that the applicant surrender himself and commence serving his sentence on 16 August 2001. I\n\ndismissed the application.",
        "Functus Officio": "5 I shall first deal with the issue of whether I could lawfully substitute my own\n\norder, some two weeks after it had been made. Section 217 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68)\n\nprovides as follows:217. Judgment not to be altered(1) No court other than the High Court, when it has recorded its judgment,\n\n    shall alter or review the judgment.(2) A clerical error may be rectified at any time and any other mistake may\n\n    be rectified at any time before the court rises for the day.I ruled inChiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor[1997] 3 SLR 445at 460, that\n\ns 217 did not attempt any substantive enactment with regard to the High Court. The phrase other\n\nthan the High Court could be interpreted to suggest that s 217 allowed the High Court to alter or\n\nreview its judgment. However, to regard so would mean that the High Court would never be functus\n\nofficio since, in theory, there would be nothing to prevent a third judgment or a fourth judgment to\n\nsupplement an earlier judgment. This would go against the universal principle of law that, when a\n\nmatter has been finally disposed of by a court, the court is, in the absence of a direct statutory\n\nprovision, functus officio and cannot entertain a fresh prayer for the same relief unless and until\n\nthe previous order of final disposal has been set aside.6 This provision, and its equivalent, has spawn different interpretations. The\n\nprevious s 369 of the Code of Criminal Procedure of India provided as follows:No court, other than a High Court, when it has signed its judgment, shall alter\n\n  or review the same, except as provided in ss 395 and 484 or to correct a clerical error.Despite the express exclusion of the High Court from the operation of this\n\nprovision, many Indian High Courts held that they had no implied power to alter or review their own\n\njudgment. InRe Gibbons14 ILR (Cal) 42 at 47, Petheram CJ stated:In my opinion the effect of the words other than a High Court is\n\n  precisely the same as if in place of them the Legislature had at the end of the section added\n\n  these words this section does not apply to the High Court. There is no substantive enactment\n\n  in that section with reference to the High Court, and all it does is to reserve the powers which\n\n  existed in the High Court before, so that they are in no degree taken away. What the powers of the\n\n  High Court were before it is unnecessary to consider, but whatever they were, they were reserved\n\n  and they were in the same position after this section was passed as they had been in before; and\n\n  inasmuch as it is not shown to us that, before the passing of this section, any power of revision\n\n  existed in the High Court, that section did not, in my opinion, create any such power, and\n\n  therefore, it appears that this section does not help the applicant.7 This was cited with approval by Spenser-Wilkinson J inPublic Prosecutor v\n\nHeng You Nang[1949] MLJ 285, a criminal appeal from Sessions Court. In this case, the Public\n\nProsecutor had applied against the acquittal of the respondent on charges connected with the alleged\n\nimportation of certain goods by the respondent. The appeal was dismissed. Subsequently, the Deputy\n\nPublic Prosecutor applied by motion that the court should hear further arguments and review its\n\njudgment. Spenser-Wilkinson J referred to s 278 of the Criminal Procedure Code of Malaysia, that\n\nprovides as follows:No Court, other than a Court of a Judge, having once recorded its judgment,\n\n  shall alter or review the same: provided that a clerical error may be rectified at any time, and\n\n  that any other mistake may be rectified at any time before the Court rises for the day.and stated that[the case ofRe Gibbons] lays down the correct principle  that once a\n\n  judgment in a criminal matter has been pronounced and signed it cannot be altered.This was significant, as Spenser-Wilkinson J, I think quite rightly, decided not\n\nto follow the judgment of McElwaine CJ inGoh Ah San & 2 Ors v The King[1938] MLJ 95.\n\nSpenser-Wilkinson J said:[In]Goh Ah San & 2 Ors v The King[1938] MLJ 95,  McElwaine\n\n  CJ having in open court dismissed the appeal of one appellant and allowed those of the other two\n\n  subsequently, when he came to give his reasons therefor, allowed the appeal of the 1stappellant. The relevant portion of his judgment is as follows:This No 1 accused was not represented on the appeal before me, and when I\n\n    dismissed his appeal, and though I had read the record, I did not appreciate the weakness of the\n\n    case against him. I have had some doubts whether I am nowfunctus officio, but no\n\n    certificate of the result of the appeal has yet been prepared. I stated I would give my reasons\n\n    for my decision, and now, having come to a conclusion favourable to the accused person I think I\n\n    am justified in applying the principle inJones v Williams41 JP 614 (referred to inRex\n\n    v Manchester Justices- Ex parte Leaver53 TLR 687) and in regarding myself as notfunctus\n\n    officio. I therefore allow the appeal of No 1 accused.It is to be observed that part of the learned Chief Justices decision was\n\n  reached without hearing any argument upon the point and there is a possibility that this decision\n\n  might not have been the same had his power to act as he did been seriously contested.8Re GibbonsandPublic Prosecutor v Heng You Nangwere cited with\n\napproval, by the Supreme Court of Malaysia inOoi Sim Yim v Public Prosecutor[1990] 1 MLJ 88. Here, the appellant had pleaded guilty to two charges, for possession of a firearm and\n\nammunition. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to ten years imprisonment and six strokes of\n\nwhipping on the first charge and another three years on the second charge and ordered that both\n\nterms of imprisonment are to run consecutively from and be backdated to the date of his arrest.\n\nAbout two and a half months after the disposal of the case, the trial judge issued a corrigenda to\n\nsubstitute the original order with a new one which had the effect of making both sentences run\n\nconsecutively, i.e. the appellant was to serve a total of 13 years imprisonment to take effect\n\nfrom the date of his arrest. The appellant appealed against the order, contending that the two\n\nsentences should run concurrently. Mohamed Azmi SCJ ruled that s 278 of the Criminal Procedure Code\n\nof Malaysia did not empower the trial judge to substitute his judgment two and a half months after\n\nit was recorded and delivered. As the judgment he gave was equivocal and capable of two\n\ninterpretations, the basic principle of criminal justice should apply in that the construction more\n\nfavourable to the appellant should be adopted rather than the substituted order subsequently made by\n\nthe trial judge.9 However inWong Hong Toy&Anor v Public Prosecutor[1994] 2 SLR 396at 408E, a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal, the learned Wee Chong Jin CJ disagreed\n\nwith these authorities and instead, said:A plain reading of [s 217] shows that the High Court can alter or review its\n\n  judgment. There is no reason to compel a restrictive interpretation, especially since we are\n\n  concerned with a superior court of record, which is also the highest court of trial in criminal\n\n  cases. We must give effect to the plain meaning of the words in the section. To ignore the words\n\n  other than the High Court would be to render them otiose. In our opinion, [s 217] gives\n\n  sanction to Lai Kew Chai J to alter the fine. It was necessary for him to do so to correct a\n\n  mistake as to the maximum fine that could be imposed.10 InChiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor[1997] 3 SLR 445at 460, I agreed\n\nwith the approach taken by Petheram CJ inRe Gibbonsand Spenser-Wilkinson J inPublic\n\nProsecutor v Heng You Nangand Mohamed Azmi SCJ inOoi Sim Yim v Public Prosecutor. With\n\nrespect and great deference, I departed from Wee Chong Jin CJs reasoning inWong Hong Toy.11 I took the opportunity inChiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutorto say at\n\n 68:..upon a true construction of s 217, I did not think that it attempted any\n\n  substantive enactment with regard to the High Court.and at  69:.. In my view, the entire [s 217] might be read as if it did not apply to the\n\n  High Court.However, as I also said at  76 and 77:.. the powers conferred on the lower courts by s 217 must, by implication, also\n\n  be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity Consequently, [the High Court has] the\n\n  requisite power in altering the sentence of the appellant in the instance case, even though it was\n\n  a substantive mistake, because it had not arisen for the day when the rectification was made. On\n\n  this approach, it was also apparent that Lai Kew Chai J had the necessary powers to reduce the\n\n  fine in the case ofWong Hong Toysince the mistake there was rectified before the court\n\n  rose for the day.12 I made the order of 2 August 2001, allowing the applicant a period of two\n\nweeks to settle his personal and work affairs, and commence serving his sentence on 16 August 2001.\n\nTo accede to this application would, in essence, entail altering my own order of 2 August 2001. With\n\nmy approach to s 217, as can be seen from the reasoning inChiaw Wai Onn v Public Prosecutor,\n\nonce the order is regarded as a judgment, I could not lawfully substitute my own order, some\n\ntwo weeks after it had been made. It is thus necessary that I go on to consider if my order of 2\n\nAugust 2001, allowing the applicant a period of two weeks to settle his personal and work affairs,\n\ncomes within the definition of judgment.",
        "Judgment": "13 The word judgment is not defined in the Criminal Procedure Code. The\n\nHalsburys Laws of England, Hailsham Ed, Vol IX, paras 260-265 explains it as a final order in a\n\ntrial terminating in the conviction or acquittal of the accused. InChhotey Lal v Tinkey Lal(1935)\n\nAIR 815, the court regarded that an order in the nature of a judgment is one which is passed on full\n\nenquiry and after hearing both parties.14 InRe Balasundara Pavalar(1951) AIR Mad 7, an order on a bail\n\napplication was regarded as nothing more than an interlocutory and tentative expression of the\n\nconclusion as to whether a person should be set at large pending trial, or disposal of his appeal\n\nand cannot be termed a judgment so as to attract the application of s 369 of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure of India. Menon J stated that [(1951) AIR Mad 7 at 12]:A judgment is one which finally acquits or convicts an accused person and any\n\n  other order passed by an appellate court disposing of the appeal would include an order of remand\n\n  or retrial. But it cannot be said that an order passed by an appellate court would include an\n\n  interlocutory rejection of an application for bail.15 Thus, by using the proper approach of analogy from decided cases from other\n\nappropriate jurisdiction, an application to ask the court to exercise its discretion, that the\n\napplicant defer serving his sentence, ought not to be treated as a judgment. Such an order cannot,\n\nby any stretch of imagination, be regarded as a final order in a trial terminating in the conviction\n\nor acquittal of an accused. The High Court, as an appellate court, has the power to review its own\n\nsuch previous order.16 However, this still leaves the issue of when and in what circumstances the\n\nHigh Court would consider a further extension of time before serving the sentence. It would be\n\nimpossible to lay down a clear-cut guideline. It is possible that during the period of extension,\n\nthe applicant may suffer from illness which necessitates treatment in hospitals or other places\n\nwhere better facilities are available. It might be that a further extension would be justifiable as\n\nthe applicants close relative or a member of immediate family happened to suffer from serious\n\nillness. Different conditions and circumstances could arise that would necessitate or justify an\n\norder of further extension of time before serving the sentence. Ultimately, the court would be\n\nguided by whether the interests of justice require that discretion be exercised to allow the\n\napplicant a further period of time before he serves his sentence. At the same time, the court must\n\ntake a robust approach and ensure that the discretion not be abused by frivolous requests from the\n\napplicant. The burden is always on the applicant to show and explain that the circumstances and\n\nconditions are of such a dire and serious nature or of such urgency that they merit the exercise of\n\ndiscretion by the court to grant a further period of time before he serves his sentence.17 Thus, I concluded that the application for a further period of time before\n\nserving the sentence of imprisonment is not a judgment. Therefore, there is nothing in law to\n\nprevent the court which passed it from re-considering it or from entertaining a fresh application\n\nfor the same relief. However, in the circumstances, there was nothing in the applicants affidavit\n\nthat showed a valid reason for the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow him a\n\nfurther period of time, before serving his sentence. I thus dismissed the motion.",
        "Conclusion": "18 Section 217(1) lays down a general prohibition against alteration of judgments\n\nby the Subordinate Courts. Section 217(2) is an exception to this general prohibition, by\n\nprescribing the limited circumstances, in which the Subordinate Courts could alter or review their\n\njudgments. Rectifications by Subordinate Courts under s 217, could go beyond mere accidental slips\n\nand omissions, the only restriction being that it must be corrected before the court rises for the\n\nday, i.e. before the working day of the court ends. And as the powers conferred on the lower courts\n\nby s 217 must by implication also be available to the High Court in its appellate capacity, the High\n\nCourt has such power to rectify the judgment, again, provided that it has not arisen for the day.19 I had decided on 2 August 2001 to grant an order that the commencement of the\n\napplicants sentence begin on 16 August 2001. And faced with the present application on 17 August\n\n2001, although I was not functus officio, and not deprived of the power to accede to the application\n\nand alter my own decision of 2 August 2001, the applicant failed to come up with any valid excuse\n\nfor the court to exercise its discretion the second time to allow him a further period of time,\n\nbefore serving his sentence.",
