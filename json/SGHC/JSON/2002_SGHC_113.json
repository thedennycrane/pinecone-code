        "(i) What was allegedly said": "71. Wolfgang Lapper’s written testimony on what was allegedly said\n\nis as follows:\"24. Sometime in 1996, Mr. Ong approached me. He suggested that I\n\n  take up part of the corridor fronting the restaurant. A queue would normally form in the\n\n  evenings along the internal corridor outside Esmirada. Further, since Esmirada’s bar\n\n  was small, sometimes the guests were standing in the internal corridor, which was also\n\n  air-conditioned. Mr. Ong told me that I could have the space for free. I was agreeable but\n\n  I recalled nothing happened for a while.25. Sometime in July or August 1996, I recalled meeting Mr. Ong again.\n\n  I was asked to make a decision whether I wanted the additional space comprising that part\n\n  of the internal fronting the restaurant. This time I was told that rent of $2,000.00 would\n\n  have to be paid. Mr. Ong also told me that the access through the internal corridor must\n\n  be retained. It was agreed that the restaurant would set up a bar on one side with some\n\n  tables and chairs for bar use only on the other side. In this way, a passageway is kept\n\n  for people to walk through.26. I accepted the Defendants’ offer through Mr. Ong and arranged\n\n  for that part of the internal corridor fronting the restaurant to be renovated. In the\n\n  renovation, provision was made for continued access through the space that was the\n\n  internal corridor to the toilets. Consequently, the additional space offered to the\n\n  Plaintiff could not be optimised. In any event, it was only to be used as a bar.\"72. To a suggestion put during cross-examination as to what Mr. Ong\n\nsaid, Mr. Lapper replied (NE 11)\"Put: Access you seek includes areas of Peranakan Place demised to\n\n  Bread Talk?A : When rented premises, there is corridor which leads to toilets.\n\n  [In] 1996 – premises rented to Delifrance. Delifrance later wanted extra space at the\n\n  front of Orchard Road – August/December of 1996. At [the] same time Ong asked if I\n\n  wanted to take up additional space on my side of [the] corridor. Business [was] doing\n\n  well. People [were] standing at corridor space waiting. I told Ong that I would discuss\n\n  with [my] partners. Ong told me [the] space had to remain as [a] corridor. Same for\n\n  Delifrance. Ong told me [I] could beautify the space. To maximise expenditure [bar] placed\n\n  on [the] left, seating area on [the] right with \"corridor space\" in between.\n\n  Delifrance also kept corridor free of chairs but ..both premises look[ed] like part of\n\n  premises [with] enhanced overall outlook.\"73. Mr. Lapper’s oral evidence that Delifrance was also to retain\n\nthe corridor at its end is not in his written testimony.74. The Defendants’ case is that this was not at all the\n\nsituation. The Defendants denied making the alleged statements.75. Contrary to Mr. Lapper’s allegation, Mr. Ong said that it was\n\nMr. Lapper who had approached him about taking over the corridor space.76. In his affidavit evidence, Mr. Ong deposed that management of\n\nDelifrance had proposed taking other units as well as the corridor space outside\n\nDelifrance. The proposal was attractive to Mr. Ong as it was \"an opportunity to\n\nreconfigure the layout of the Peranakan Place in order to maximise functionality and to\n\nenhance rental yield.\" Delifrance also wanted exclusive use of the corridor space and\n\nthis was agreed.77. Mr. Ong ‘s written evidence on this subject is as follows:\"30. At no time did I tell Wolfgang that the Additional Space and\n\n  the access to the toilets would be retained when the Plaintiffs took up the lease for the\n\n  Additional Space. It would not have made commercial sense for the Defendants to jeopardize\n\n  the $60,000 per month rental (S$37.66 per square foot) that Delifrance was paying in\n\n  respect of the 1593 square foot area of the Adjacent Premises for the monthly sum of\n\n  S$2,000 (S$3.06 per square foot) that the Plaintiffs were paying for the Additional Space.\n\n  As the Adjacent Premises had been demised to Delifrance, the Defendants would have been in\n\n  breach of their contractual obligations to Delifrance if an agreement had been entered\n\n  into with the Plaintiffs to the effect that Delifrance would be required to allow the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ patrons to cut across the Adjacent premises. For both ethical and\n\n  commercial reasons, such a course of action is unthinkable.37. After the lease of the Additional Space to the Plaintiffs and the\n\n  Adjacent Premises to Delifrance, the internal corridor no longer existed.…41. ……..At no time did the Defendants seek to interfere with\n\n  the express contractual rights of their tenants to the quiet enjoyment of the premises\n\n  demised to them.67. ..At no time did I represent to the Plaintiffs that the Defendants\n\n  would keep the Doorway open to allow access to the toilets through the Additional Space\n\n  and across the Adjacent Premises or that the Defendants would do so for the\n\n  Plaintiffs’ benefit.\"(ii) Principal point in dispute78. As to what was said, the evidence of Mr. Lapper and Mr. Ong is in\n\ndirect contradiction. This is the principal point on which the parties divide. There is\n\nlittle agreement between the parties as to what occurred.79. Mr. Lapper and Mr. Ong met three or four times before 26 August\n\n1996. The meetings were to discuss business common to both men and on those occasions the\n\ntaking over of the corridor space outside Esmirada was raised. No one took any notes of\n\nthose conversations. Before 26 August 1996, neither side wrote to the other afterwards\n\nreferring to what had been discussed. Except for the letter of 26 August 1996, there are\n\nno other documents generated during this period that will help shed light on the events\n\nand conversations relating to the letting of the corridor space to the Plaintiffs.80. The Plaintiffs were unable to furnish particulars of the duration\n\nand details of the alleged discussions. The Plaintiffs simply pleaded that they are\n\n\"not able to recall the duration save that the discussions took place over the course\n\nof 3 to 4 days.\" See  2(iii) Further and Better Particulars dated 18 January 2002.\n\nMr. Lapper’s recollection of the conversations and events are not necessarily more\n\nreliable than Mr. Ong’s. Both were speaking long after the event and with\n\nrecollections inevitably coloured by hindsight.81. In a case like this where there is a conflict of evidence, in\n\nascertaining the truth it is necessary to consider the objective facts, documents and the\n\noverall probabilities.82. In the end, I favour Mr. Ong’s version, which is consistent\n\nwith commercial reality and the independent testimony of Mr. Prince. I therefore find as a\n\nfact that Mr. Ong as director of the Defendants did not make the representations alleged.\n\nI reached this view assisted by several factors such as:(i) The Plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that in August 1996, Mr. Ong\n\n  approached Mr. Lapper about taking over the Additional Space. By then, Mr. Ong had already\n\n  reached an in principle agreement with Delifrance to lease the Adjacent Premises. As Mr.\n\n  Ong in re-examination replied (NE 571, 565):\"Q : Why did you say your discussion with Esmirada never\n\n  include[d] any discussion for the need of access using the internal corridor as a\n\n  passageway to the toilets?A : It could not be because by that point in time I had already agreed\n\n  and decided that Delifrance will occupy the adjacent space such that there would not be a\n\n  corridor anymore.\"…….\"A : ..I did not agree to the maintaining of the passageway and\n\n  the doorway. It would not be possible for me to lease the adjacent space to Delifrance and\n\n  to agree the passageway and doorway.\"Further, in the course of being questioned by Mr. Tan about how the\n\n  $2,000 rental was fixed, Mr. Ong said he could not recall whether $2,000 was his or Mr.\n\n  Lapper’s figure but he remembered \"mentioning the rental that was being agreed\n\n  upon with Delifrance for the adjacent premises.\" (see NE 443). Again, that\n\n  unchallenged testimony is consistent with Mr. Ong’s evidence that his conversations\n\n  with Mr. Lapper were after he had reached an agreement with Delifrance.(ii) It is most unlikely that Mr. Ong would have promised uninterrupted\n\n  right of access and right of way for as long as Plaintiffs remained a tenant. If that were\n\n  to happen, Mr. Ong would have had to reserve for the Defendants a right of way in the\n\n  lease with the tenant of adjoining premises. I have already found that there was no such\n\n  reservation in the Delifrance lease.(iii) Where two sets of tenants are involved, as was the case here,\n\n  each tenancy with a different commencement and termination period, it would offend\n\n  commercial reality to provide for the right of way as claimed. Given the very nature of\n\n  the right of way claimed by the Plaintiffs, no reasonable businessman and landlord of\n\n  commercial property with Mr. Ong’s experience would think and behave in the way\n\n  alleged. It is unreasonable to conclude that the Defendants would have contemplated\n\n  \"tying up\" indefinitely their ability to use and deal with their property as\n\n  head lessees. Thus, the inference to be drawn is that the alleged representations could\n\n  not have been made.(iv) It is inconceivable that a matter of such importance to the\n\n  Plaintiffs would not have been reduced to writing. It is significant that no reason\n\n  whatsoever was proffered by the Plaintiffs at the trial as to why the alleged requirement\n\n  should not have been recorded in the August 1996 letter. I can only conclude that the\n\n  representations were not made and parties accepted that the terms contained in the letter\n\n  were indeed complete.(v) There is Hugues Prince’s evidence that it was Delifrance who\n\n  did not mind the public traversing its premises. The evidence of the Plaintiffs’ own\n\n  witness, Mr. Prince, collaborates Mr. Ong’s written testimony. In  40 of his\n\n  affidavit evidence-in-chief, Mr. Ong deposed that Delifrance had no objections to\n\n  Esmirada’s customers making use of this [walking through its premises] as a route to\n\n  the ground floor toilets.(vi) The Defendants over a period of five years were aware that the\n\n  public would gain access to the ground floor toilets via Esmirada and Delifrance. That\n\n  awareness cannot conceptually be equated to representations, acquiescence or encouragement\n\n  when it was the type of activity Delifrance had unilaterally permitted.(vii) There is Mr. Lapper’s evidence that if he had known that\n\n  Delifrance had only taken a two-year lease, he would have similarly taken a two-year lease\n\n  offered by the Defendants instead of signing on for three years as they had done with the\n\n  result that Delifrance’s lease ended a year earlier than the Plaintiffs’.83. Mr. Tan relied on three documents to demonstrate that Mr. Ong had\n\nmade the representations. The first document is a fax dated 4 January 1998 to Mr. Ong from\n\nGGW. At 1PBD page 139, GGW wrote:\" Deli France is now blocking the walk way (sic) every day so our\n\n  customers have difficulties to go to the toilet.\"84. Mr. Ong’s handwritten remark reads:\"We will write to them.\"85. I am not persuaded that Mr. Ong’s handwritten reply assists\n\nthe Plaintiffs. Reference to \"walkway\" in the letter does not necessarily relate\n\nto the alleged rights. It would not make sense for Delifrance to clutter or block its\n\npremises, as that must surely affect its own restaurant business. Reference to\n\n\"walkway\" could probably mean the stretch of common area outside Delifrance\n\nleading to the flight of steps to the ground floor toilets.86. On that document, Mr. Tan cross-examined Mr. Ong about access\n\nthrough the Adjacent Premises and Mr. Ong said that he had not intervened on that matter\n\n[NE 516].\" Q : How many times [have you] intervened as Plaintiffs to\n\n  enforce [the] right of [the ] Plaintiffs’ access over adjacent premises?A : NoQ : At 1PB139 you say \"we will write to them\"?A : YesQ : So you didn’t write to them?A : No\"The fact of the matter is that no letter was ever written nor did Mr.\n\nOng contact Delifrance.87. Mr. Ong said he wrote the note in his capacity as director of the\n\nPlaintiffs. That evidence is not far-fetched since Mustard Seed was in charge of the\n\nadministrative matters of Lemon Grass.88. The other documents Mr. Tan relied on are two letters from Harry\n\nElias Partnership dated 6 August and 5 September 2001 respectively. There, the\n\nDefendants’ solicitors wrote that their clients had granted a concession to the\n\nPlaintiffs which they are now withdrawing. The inference he wanted to draw is that the\n\nconversations with Mr. Ong on access through the doorway did take place and given effect\n\nto.89. In my view, the two letters also do not assist the Plaintiffs. I am\n\nunable to read the letters in the same way. The September letter is quite categorical in\n\npointing out that no right of access and right of way had been granted to the Plaintiffs\n\nunder the 26 August 1996 letter including the tenancy agreement dated 29 December 1999.\n\nThat letter clarified the earlier letter of 6 August 2001.90. In addition, it went on to allude to the doorway being left\n\nunsealed in 1996 as a concession to the Plaintiffs but the Defendants now wish to exercise\n\ntheir right under Clause 5(14) of the December 1999 lease.91. Mr. Quahe’s submission is that reading the letters in context,\n\nthe word \"concession\" is synonymous with \"forbearance\". He argued that\n\nit was due to the Defendants’ \"forbearance\" in 1996 that the doorway was\n\nnot sealed. That interpretation accords with my understanding of the two letters.92. In any case, I do not place much weight on the letters written by\n\nHarry Elias Partnership. They were written at an early stage when the rights and defences\n\nof the parties were not fully understood and formulated by those representing the\n\nrespective parties. How much the Plaintiffs understood their own case is best gleaned from\n\nthe various amendments to their pleadings; the last amendment to include a claim in\n\nproprietary estoppel was made on the first day of the trial. When the Defendants first\n\nraised the sealing of the doorway on 30 July 2001, the Plaintiffs in fax dated 31 July\n\n2001 did not agree to it. Nothing was said then about rights promised to the Plaintiffs.\n\nNeither was it raised as a ground of objection on 8 and 22 August 2001 by the\n\nPlaintiffs’ then solicitors, Infinitus Law Corporation. In their August reply,\n\nInfinitus Law Corporation objected to the sealing of the doorway and argued the\n\nDefendants’ breach of Clause 1(b) of the December 1999 lease. One would have expected\n\nthe Plaintiffs to protest that the Defendants could not board up the doorway as the\n\nPlaintiffs were on a promise to be allowed internal access to the ground floor toilets\n\nuntil the end of the Plaintiffs’ lease.93. Mr. Tan argued that the absence of an application to change the\n\ncorridor to lettable space supports his contention that the representations were made. I\n\nagree with Mr. Quahe’s submission that there is want of evidence to indicate that\n\napproval for such a change was required. In any case, under Clause 3(4) of the lease, it\n\nis for the tenant to make the necessary application.94. The bar-cum-waiting area did not have the physical appearance or\n\ndistinctive characteristics of a corridor or passageway. There was no signage indicating\n\nthat it was a route to the ground floor toilets within Peranakan Place. There was no\n\n‘EXIT’ sign above or near the rope curtain to indicate that it was another way\n\nout of the restaurant; an entrance as argued by the Plaintiffs.95. The Plaintiffs called Tan Koon Siang the contractor involved in the\n\nrenovations to the bar-cum-waiting area. He testified that Mr. Lapper had told him that\n\nthe Additional Space was to accommodate a passageway and that he was to ensure that the\n\nlayout did not impede the passageway. For privacy Mr. Lapper had suggested installing a\n\nrope curtain.96. I place little reliance on Tan Koon Siang’s evidence. Work\n\norders for the renovation were not produced. The quotation and invoice were of no\n\nassistance. Contrary to Tan Koon Siang’s claim that he could still remember the works\n\ndone by his company some five years ago, his recollection is demonstrably inaccurate. For\n\nexample in  5 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, he deposed that his workmen\n\ninstalled the rope curtain. On being questioned about this by Mr. Quahe, the witness\n\nreplied (NE 142):\"Q : Rope curtain[s], installed by you?A : I installed the roller shutter...\"97. On checking the quotation and invoice produced by the Plaintiffs\n\nfor the renovation, I cannot find any item billed by Tan Koon Siang’s company for\n\neither the rope curtain or the roller shutter door. Curiously, the quotation and invoice\n\nsubmitted by the Plaintiffs were addressed to Papa Joe’s and not to the Plaintiffs.98. Having concluded that Mr. Ong did not agree to allow internal\n\naccess to the ground floor toilets to the Plaintiffs, the claims based on collateral\n\ncontract and proprietary estoppel must necessarily fail. Even if I had held the other way\n\nin favour of Mr. Lapper, that would not be enough to further the Plaintiffs’ cause.\n\nThere are obstacles in the way of both these alternative claims, which I shall now deal\n\nwith.The Collateral Contract99.    This issue would involve a consideration of the burden of\n\nproof upon the party alleging the oral collateral contract and the application of the\n\nparol evidence rule.100. In my view, the Plaintiffs face insuperable difficulties with this\n\ncause of action. Three difficulties are considered below.101. That said, I noticed that the Plaintiffs in Closing Submissions\n\nhad hardly argued their case on an enforceable oral collateral contract. They chose to\n\nconcentrate in the main on a claim founded on proprietary estoppel.",
        "(i) The pleadings": "102. By  9 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim, the Plaintiffs\n\npleaded that there was an agreement (collateral to or expressly provided for in Clause\n\n1(b) of the leases executed), which allows for ready and easy access to toilet/washroom\n\nfacility by a corridor.103. In Further and Better Particulars filed on 18 January 2002, the\n\nPlaintiffs referred to  2 to 8 of the Statement of Claim [same as Re-Amended Statement\n\nof Claim] as the facts and matters in support of the alleged collateral agreement allowing\n\nfor ready and easy access to the toilet/washroom facility by a corridor.104. The Plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that in August 1996, Mr. Ong\n\napproached Mr. Lapper about renting the Additional Space. Against the Defendants, the\n\nPlaintiffs pleaded an agreement between the parties that the internal layout of the\n\nAdditional Space would be planned in such a way that the \"Corridor would continue to\n\nbe the Access\".105. The words \"Access\" and \"Corridor\" are\n\nrespectively defined in  2 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim as:\"Access\" and \"Corridor\" mean \" ..ready and\n\n  easy access(\"the Access\") to the toilet/washroom facility by a corridor\n\n  (\"the Corridor\") located at very close proximity to Esmirada.\"106. Rather than plead the consideration for the alleged collateral\n\nagreement that is essential, the Plaintiffs confusingly pleaded in  5 of the Re-Amended\n\nStatement of Claim the following:\" On the basis of theAgreementreached with the Defendants\n\n  (through Ong), the Plaintiffs took up the lease of the Additional Space and proceeded with\n\n  the renovations to the same following the agreed layout with the Access.The Agreement\n\n  was evidenced by a letter dated 26thAugust 1996.\" [emphasis added]107. In addition, the Plaintiffs’ pleaded case is that the August\n\nletter did not contain all the terms. The other oral term is set out in  5(i) of the\n\nFurther and Better Particulars, which reads:\"5i) The discussions entered into with Ong, in particular\n\n  regarding the property layout of the additional space wherein the Plaintiffs were required\n\n  to retain the Corridor of which the Plaintiffs would have same, leading the Plaintiff to\n\n  believe and understand the matters stated in paragraph 4.\"108. Reading  3 to 8 of the Re-Amended Statement of Claim with the\n\nparticulars provided, the retention of the corridor as access is not a term of the alleged\n\ncollateral contract but an oral term of the \"Agreement\" evidenced by the 26\n\nAugust 1996 letter. Such a plea falls foul of the legal requirements of a collateral\n\ncontract which consists of the promisee [the Plaintiffs] entering or promising to enter\n\ninto a principal contract with the promisor [the Defendants], after a statement which\n\ntakes effect as a term in a second contract between the promisee and the promisor\n\ncollateral to the principal contract:Heilbut Symons & Co v Buckleton[1913] AC 30.109. On pleadings alone, the Plaintiffs’ claim insofar as it is\n\nbased on the alleged collateral contract fails. Nonetheless, I shall say something about\n\nthe alleged oral term.110. In their letter of 26 August 1996 [1AB 130], the Defendants wrote:\"26 August 1996Lemon Grass Pte Ltd180 Orchard Road#01-01/02 Peranakan PlaceSingapore 238846Dear SirsLEASE OF ADDITIONAL SPACE AT PERANAKAN PLACE COMPLEXWe refer to (1) the Tenancy Agreement dated 13 December 1993 made\n\n  between Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd as Landlord and GGW Gastrofun Pte Ltd as Tenant,\n\n  and (2) the Novation Agreement dated 19 March 1996 between Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd\n\n  as Landlord, GGW Gastrofun Pte Ltd as Tenant and Lemon Grass Pte Ltd as New Tenant (both\n\n  Agreements hereinafter collectively referred to as the \"Agreements\").We are pleased to confirm our agreement to lease to you the additional\n\n  space which is shown outlined in red on the plan annexed to this letter at the rent of\n\n  Singapore Dollars Two Thousand (S$2,000.00) per month with effect from the 1stday of October 1996, which will be payable at the same times and in the same manner as the\n\n  total monthly rent payable under the Agreements. All the terms and conditions of the\n\n  Agreements will apply to the lease of the additional space.Please signify your acceptance by signing below on the Acceptance Copy\n\n  and return it to us not later than 30 August 1996 together with a cheque for the sum of\n\n  S$6,000.00 drawn in favour of \"Peranakan Place Complex Pte Ltd\" for the\n\n  additional security deposit required.Thank you,Yours sincerelyFor & On Behalf ofPERANAKAN PLACE COMPLEX PTE LTDSgd.MRS SHERIE ONGDirectorACCEPTANCE COPYWe, LEMON GRASS PTE LTD hereby accept and confirm the abovementioned\n\n  terms.Sgd. Wolfgang Lapper_______________________________Signature of Authorised Representative& Company’s Chop stamped: LEMON GRASS PTE LTD27 Aug ’96______________Date\"111. The other terms of the 1993 lease were incorporated by reference\n\nin that letter. Mr. Lapper unconditionally signed the confirmation letter the next day on\n\n27 August 1996 [1AB131] even though the letter dated 26 August was silent as far as the\n\nalleged requirement to maintain as a condition of the lease the passageway leading to the\n\nground floor toilets.112. There is no evidence to support the pleadings that the August 1996\n\nletter was intended to contain part of a fuller agreement, the other part was orally made.\n\nOnce an agreement is reduced and made in writing it is treated as such unless the parties\n\nare shown otherwise to intend.113. If the intention was for the requirement to have been a term of\n\nthe August contract, it would have been a simple matter to add it to the written letter.114. As the agreement to lease the Additional Space was reduced to\n\nwriting, verbal evidence of the alleged oral term is not allowed to add to or in any\n\nmanner vary or qualify the written contract: Ss 93 and 94Evidence Act(cap\n\n97).115. I would in passing mention that all relevant terms of the December\n\n1999 lease are the same as previous leases. None of those previous leases contain a right\n\nof access and right of way claimed by the Plaintiffs. There was no explanation at all as\n\nto why the rights claimed were not recorded in the lease at each renewal given its alleged\n\nimportance to the Plaintiffs’ business as a fine dining establishment. It is not\n\ndisputed that the parties were legally represented at the time of each renewal.",
        "(ii) Plaintiffs’ failure to establish requirements of a collateral contract.": "116.A collateral contract is an agreement distinct from the\n\nmain contract. A court must therefore find all the usual legal requirements of a contract\n\nhaving been fulfilled with respect to the collateral agreement before it can be enforced.117. What this means is that the statement purporting to be the\n\ncontractual promise in such a collateral contract must be promissory in nature or effect\n\nrather than representational:De Lassalle v Guildford[1901] 2 KB 215:Wells\n\n(Merstham) v Buckland Sand & Silica Ltd[1965] 2 QB 170;Esso Petroleum\n\nv Marden[1976] 1QB 801 at 826. The Plaintiffs must establish the agreement of the\n\nparties to its terms. Thus, to succeed in a claim founded on a collateral contract, the\n\nPlaintiffs have to prove certainty of the terms.118. It is for the party seeking to rely upon the collateral contract\n\nwho has to bear the burden of establishing that both parties intended to create a legally\n\nbinding contract: Ralph Gibson LJ inKleinworth Benson Ltd v Malaysia Mining\n\nCorporation Berhad[1989] 1 All E.R. 785 at 796.119. They must also establish consideration, which in the case of a\n\ncollateral contract is easy to prove. All that is required is the promisee [the\n\nPlaintiffs] entering or promising to enter into a principal contract with the promisor\n\n[the Defendants]. As stated, this consideration was not pleaded.120. The Plaintiffs did not address in Closing Submissions a key issue,\n\nwhich is, even if Mr. Ong said what he did (and I found that he did not), what was the\n\neffect in law of those statements? Did they amount to a collateral contract regarding\n\naccess to the ground floor toilets through the Adjacent Premises leased to Delifrance?121. Nowhere in Closing Submissions was it put forward that what Mr.\n\nOng allegedly said were contractual in character or effect, an essential requirement to\n\nestablishing the existence of a collateral contract. In fact, the Plaintiffs had\n\nessentially argued that the alleged statements were representations and nothing more.122. Other than a passing reference to the collateral agreement being\n\nadmissible besides s 94Evidence Actin the context of the doctrine of\n\nestoppel, nothing else was said in the Closing Submissions about this cause of action.123. In any event, it would have been difficult in my view for the\n\nPlaintiffs to establish the existence of a collateral contract even on the assumption that\n\nthe alleged statements as to right of access and right of way were uttered. A tenancy like\n\nall contracts requires certainty of terms. A factor, which does suggest that the agreement\n\ncannot be properly construed as having intended to create a collateral agreement, is the\n\nvagueness as to the duration of the alleged right of way. The duration was not from a\n\nstatement made by Mr. Ong but came about from Mr. Lapper’s understanding of the\n\nconversations.124. This is a landlord-tenant relationship. In this context, the\n\nalleged collateral contract would be a business contract. Such a contract must be viewed\n\ncommercially, and it would be a palpable absurdity to consider such a contract granting a\n\npersonal right of use for as long as the Plaintiffs are tenants. In terms of duration,\n\nthis is difficult to accept as the right involves passing and repassing over property\n\nleased to another tenant whose interest in terms of period of occupation did not coincide,\n\nas was the case here.125. Overall, considering the various points against the existence of a\n\ncollateral agreement in the circumstances of this case, and particularly reflecting on the\n\nimplication of the language used in the documents, I conclude that the Plaintiffs have not\n\nestablished the existence of a collateral contract.",
        "(iii) Inadmissibility of collateral contract": "126. Even if a different view is taken on the question of the existence\n\nof a collateral contract, the collateral agreement (again on the assumption that the\n\nalleged statements were made), could not stand consistently with the main written\n\nagreement and for that reason, could not be enforced: S 94(b)Evidence Act(Cap.97).127. CJ Yong, delivering the judgment of the Court of Appeal inLatham\n\nv Credit Suisse First Boston[2000] 2SLR 693at p 701 said:\"In our judgment, it [s 94(b)] could not operate to admit evidence\n\n  of the verbal agreement either as a collateral contract or as forming part of the terms of\n\n  a part oral or part written contract. Section 94(b) only allows the admission of evidence\n\n  of a collateral contract on matters, which are not inconsistent with the written\n\n  agreement. Where the alleged terms of the oral agreement are in addition to and therefore\n\n  inconsistent with the written contract, that evidence is inadmissible:Ng Lay Choo\n\n  Marion v Lok Lai Oi[1995] 3 SLR 221.\"128. Apart from the two rights [Clause 1(a) and (b)] expressly reserved\n\nto the Plaintiffs in the December 1999 lease, all other liberties, rights, easements or\n\nadvantages are expressly excluded by Clause 1. To that extent, the rights claimed by the\n\nPlaintiffs in the collateral contract contradict or are in conflict with the terms of the\n\nlease. The collateral agreement is thus not admissible in evidence.129. There is also Clause 5(17) of the December 1999 lease. It\n\nprohibits the Plaintiffs from claiming any right to traverse the Adjacent Premises. This\n\nclause is plainly at variance to the alleged collateral contract.130. There is also Clause 4(7), which is the covenant for quiet\n\nenjoyment in the December 1999 lease. The alleged rights, which required the Plaintiffs to\n\nretain the corridor and to allow public to walk through the bar-cum-waiting area of the\n\nrestaurant, is incompatible with this covenant.131. In the result, the Plaintiffs’ claim insofar as it is based\n\non a breach of the alleged collateral contract is dismissed.Proprietory Estoppel132. This cause of action is pleaded in  12 of the Re-Amended\n\nStatement of Claim. In the Further and Better Particulars to 12 of the Re-Amended\n\nStatement of Claim filed on 29 January 2002, the Plaintiffs pleaded the nature of the\n\ninterest in the land as:\"1(h). Right to use the Corridor as the Access to and from the\n\n  toilet/washroom facilities.\"133. Further, the detriment claimed by them is as follows:\"1(i). The Plaintiffs have incurred expense to renovate, and the\n\n  layout had to accommodate the Access by providing for its continued availability.\"134. Generally, if the owner of land requests or allows another to\n\nincur expenditure or otherwise prejudice himself under an expectation created or\n\nencouraged by the owner that he will obtain an interest in the land, that raises an equity\n\nin the other which is satisfied in whatever is the most appropriate way:Dillwyn v\n\nLlewelyn(1862) 4 De GF & J 517 andRamsden v Dyson(1866) LR 1\n\nHL 129. To establish a claim in proprietory estoppel, three elements must be shown: (a) an\n\nassurance, (b) a reliance, and (3) a detriment. Once established, the question ultimately\n\nis whether or not the assertion of strict legal rights would be unconscionable: seeTaylor\n\nFashions Ltd v Liverpool Victoria Trustees Co Ltd[1982] QB 133.135. Since I have concluded that the alleged representations were not\n\nmade, any belief that Mr. Lapper may have had was not encouraged by Mr. Ong. In any event,\n\nnothing in the circumstances of the case supports the creation of an interest in the land.\n\nThe Plaintiffs claimed that they had incurred substantial renovation expenses as a result\n\nof the alleged representations.136. The alleged expenditure of S$60,000 was not proven. The invoice\n\nproduced by the Plaintiffs was unhelpful. Mr. Ong in  36 of his written testimony said\n\nthat only $13,831.00 was spent on renovations. The renovations or redecorations in any\n\ncase carried little weight in that they did not represent much more than fitting out the\n\nAdditional Space while it was being occupied. There is want of evidence that the\n\nexpenditure pleaded by the Plaintiffs is referable to a genuine belief in the\n\nPlaintiffs’ entitlement to the rights claimed.137. I cannot see any equity arising out of the alleged expenditure.\n\nThe Plaintiffs renovated the Additional Space once after confirming the tenancy in August\n\n1996. Mr. Lapper testified that renovations were completed in early 1997. Mr. Lapper\n\nadmitted during cross-examination that the Plaintiffs had benefited from taking up the\n\nAdditional Space. The Plaintiffs’ business was doing extremely well in 1996. The\n\nAdditional Space would ease the congestion in the corridor, offer a comfortable holding\n\narea for patrons to wait and at the same time generate income through the sale of drinks.\n\nThere was no evidence that Mr. Lapper had an alternative plan to the Defendants’\n\noffer or that he had other opportunities. The inference is that Mr Lapper would have\n\nproceeded exactly as he did.138. In all the circumstances here, the claim based on proprietory\n\nestoppel fails.Derogation from grant139. Insofar as this plea is concerned, the Plaintiffs’ case is\n\nthat the grant comes with convenient and readily accessible toilet facilities. Having\n\nconcluded that there was no such express grant in the lease or otherwise promised, the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim under this cause of action must necessarily fail.Counterclaim.140. The Defendants are no longer pursuing their claim for breach of\n\nClause 3(13) of the December 1993 lease. The Counterclaim is thus limited to a claim for\n\nunpaid invoices in a total sum of $18,703.90 in respect of electricity and water charges\n\nconsumed by the Plaintiffs and for which the Defendants are under Clause 3(3) entitled to\n\nclaim reimbursement.141. I agree with Mr. Tan’s submission that the Defendants have\n\nnot proven their claim for reimbursement. No evidence was led to show that tapping of\n\nelectricity was discovered in or around August 2001 during the upgrading of Peranakan\n\nPlace. Other than what has been stated in the invoices, no evidence was adduced to explain\n\nhow the Defendants’ apportionment was arrived at. No bills from Power Supply were\n\nintroduced in evidence.142. I accept Mr. Lapper’s evidence that the Plaintiffs were\n\nbilled for electricity every month. The Defendants have not proven that there is no double\n\nbilling, bearing in mind that the invoices (DB 622, 664 and 693) are for electrical\n\nconsumption dating back to 1996 until 2001.143. As for invoice 1253 from the Defendants for water supplied to\n\nEsmirada for October 2001, the Plaintiffs’ defence is that they have not received it.\n\nThe Defendants under Clause 3(3) is to notify the Plaintiffs in writing of the amount\n\napportioned by the landlords and payable by the Plaintiffs.144. I agree with Mr. Tan that the Defendants led no evidence as to\n\nwhen and how written notification was given to the Plaintiffs. The Defendants rely on 2\n\nletters dated 18 and 28 December 2001 from their solicitors as proof of notice. A copy of\n\ninvoice 1253 was forwarded under cover of both letters to M/s Lim & Lim, the\n\nPlaintiffs’ former solicitors. These letters do not help much as they were written\n\nafter the Counterclaim was filed on 8 November 2001. They do not constitute proper written\n\nnotification envisaged by Clause 3(3).Result145. For the reasons set out above, I accordingly dismiss the Plaintiffs’ action\n\nwith costs to the Defendants. I also dismiss the Defendants’ Counterclaim with costs\n\nto the Plaintiffs. I shall hear parties on costs of interlocutory applications, which had\n\nbeen reserved.Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
