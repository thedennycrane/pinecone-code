        "Introduction": "1       This case concerned an application for leave\n                    under Order 53 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the Rules”) by UDL Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd (“the\n                    plaintiff”) to apply for a quashing order and a mandatory order\n                    (“the application”) against Jurong Town Corporation\n                    (“JTC”). The application arose out of JTC’s refusal to renew\n                    the plaintiff’s lease or to grant the plaintiff a fresh lease of the\n                    premises rented by the plaintiff at Benoi Road. 2       After hearing arguments from both parties and\n                    from the Attorney-General (“the AG”), I dismissed the application.\n                    The plaintiff has appealed against my dismissal (in Civil Appeal No. 238 of\n                    2010) and I now set out the grounds for my decision.",
        "Background": "",
        "The parties": "3       The plaintiff was the lessee of land located at\n                    3 Benoi Road, Singapore 629877 (“the Premises”). The plaintiff\n                    used the Premises as a shipyard for its shipbuilding business. 4       JTC was the lessor of the Premises. JTC is a\n                    statutory board incorporated under the Jurong Town Corporation Act\n                    (Cap 150, 1998 Rev Ed) (“the JTC Act”). JTC held the\n                    Premises under a lease from the State (“the Head\n                Lease”).",
        "The plaintiff’s application to renew the Lease": "5       The plaintiff’s lease of the Premises\n                    (“the Lease”) was due to expire on 31 December 2010. On 6 and\n                    22 August 2008, the plaintiff applied to JTC to renew the Lease\n                    (“the Renewal Application”). 6       In his affidavit filed in support of the\n                    application, Leung Yat Tung (“Leung”), the plaintiff’s\n                    managing-director deposed that the Economic Development Board\n                    (“EDB”) was involved in the plaintiff’s decision to make the\n                    Renewal Application. Leung stated that the plaintiff had initially intended to\n                    assign the Lease to a company known as Kim Hock Corporation Pte Ltd. Leung\n                    explained that the plaintiff decided to assign the Lease because it had heard\n                    from “market talk” and JTC’s officers that JTC planned to\n                    redevelop waterfront sites, including the Premises, and that leases affected by\n                    such plans would not be renewed. Leung claimed that he was contacted by one\n                    Sidat Senanayake (“Senanayake”), an EDB officer, in late February\n                    2005. Leung stated that Senanayake persuaded the plaintiff to call off its\n                    assignment of the Lease by representing,inter\n                        alia, that JTC had reconsidered its redevelopment plans.\n                    Senanayake eventually wrote to Leung on 26 May 2005 to inform him that JTC\n                    was agreeable to considering a conditional extension of the Lease, subject to\n                    EDB’s support. Leung further detailed his interactions with EDB between\n                    February 2005 and November 2009 in his affidavit. 7       I should mention that JTC’s consideration\n                    of the Renewal Application was delayed because of a waterfront\n                study.",
        "The alleged involvement of Keppel Singmarine Pte Ltd": "8       Leung claimed that Hoe Eng Hock\n                    (“Hoe”), the executive director of Keppel Singmarine Ltd\n                    (“Keppel Singmarine”), approached him to propose that the\n                    plaintiff share the Premises with Keppel Singmarine. Leung asserted that Hoe\n                    told him that the Lease would not be renewed if the plaintiff did not agree to\n                    Hoe’s proposal. 9       Hoe denied Leung’s allegations in an\n                    affidavit filed in other proceedings between the plaintiff and JTC (see[18]below). Hoe claimed that he only\n                    offered to sublet a part of the Premises for a short period of approximately 12\n                    months to ameliorate any space congestion that Keppel Singmarine might\n                    face.",
        "JTC’s rejection of the Renewal Application": "10     JTC eventually informed the plaintiff, in a\n                    letter dated 20 November 2009, that it would not be renewing the Lease\n                    (“the First Rejection Letter”). 11     The plaintiff wrote several letters to JTC and\n                    EDB between November 2009 and June 2010 even though JTC had indicated in the\n                    First Rejection Letter that its rejection of the Renewal Application was\n                    final. 12     On 19 May 2010, JTC wrote to the\n                    plaintiff to advise that EDB and JTC had jointly evaluated the plaintiff’s\n                    business plans and had concluded that they were unable to support the Renewal\n                    Application (“the Second Rejection Letter”).",
        "The plaintiff’s meeting with JTC and EDB on 16 June\n                2010": "13     Following the Second Rejection Letter, the\n                    plaintiff wrote to the chairmen of JTC and EDB. JTC responded that both JTC and\n                    EDB would arrange to meet with the plaintiff to clarify their\n                policies. 14     The plaintiff met with representatives of JTC\n                    and EDB on 16 June 2010, (“the 16 June 2010 Meeting”).\n                    Leung claimed that one Tang Wai Yee (“Tang”), a JTC officer,\n                    explained that waterfront land was scarce and so JTC had to allocate such land\n                    to companies with the best business plans. Leung also alleged that Tang informed\n                    him that JTC required a minimum amount of investment from companies applying for\n                    leases of waterfront land and that the plaintiff’s proposed investment of\n                    $20.6m was too low.",
        "The plaintiff’s proposal to take over a lease of 17 Pandan\n                Road": "15     On 4 June 2010, the plaintiff wrote to\n                    JTC with a proposal that the plaintiff take over the current lease of land\n                    located at 17 Pandan Road (“the 17 Pandan Road Lease”) if JTC\n                    agreed to extend the 17 Pandan Road Lease. JTC did not reply to this\n                    letter. 16     Leung deposed that he raised the\n                    plaintiff’s request for a renewal of the 17 Pandan Road Lease at the\n                    16 June 2010 Meeting. Leung claimed that Tang responded that it would\n                    “look funny” if JTC were to reject the Renewal Application but\n                    approve the plaintiff’s application for the 17 Pandan Road Lease. Leung\n                    also claimed that when he asked Tang if the plaintiff had been\n                    “blackmarked [sic] permanently” by\n                    JTC, Tang responded that she could not answer Leung. 17     JTC filed an affidavit in response to\n                    Leung’s claims regarding the 17 Pandan Road Lease. JTC’s Deputy\n                    Director of the Aerospace, Marine and Cleantech Cluster, Loh Yew Pong\n                    (“Loh”), deposed that he was present at the 16 June 2010 Meeting\n                    but could not confirm if Leung’s recounting of the comments made by Tang\n                    was verbatim. Loh explained nevertheless that those comments should be\n                    understood in context. The plaintiff did not submit any application for the 17\n                    Pandan Road Lease. Loh explained that JTC was “rightfully curious”\n                    as to how the plaintiff’s business plan in relation to the Lease, which\n                    was rejected by JTC, would impress JTC in relation to another plot of land. As\n                    for the response to the plaintiff’s question on whether it was\n                    “blackmarked”, Loh explained that Tang’s response, if in\n                    fact it was given, was a prudent answer because the meaning of\n                    “blackmarked” was unclear.",
        "Suit No 502 of 2010": "18     On 21 July 2010, the plaintiff commenced\n                    proceedings against JTC in Suit No 502 of 2010 (“Suit 502”). The\n                    plaintiff claimed,inter alia, the following\n                    reliefs in Suit 502: (a)     a declaration that JTC’s\n                        refusal to renew the Lease was and is wrongful; (b)     a declaration that JTC is estopped from refusing\n                        to renew the Lease or refusing to grant a new lease; (c)     an order that JTC renew the Lease or\n                        grant a new lease; and (d)     further, or in the alternative, that the plaintiff be\n                        awarded equitable compensation and/or damages to be\n                assessed. 19     At the hearing before this court, counsel for\n                    JTC (Dhillon Dinesh) informed the court that Suit 502 had been fixed for an\n                    expedited hearing between 16 and 25 February 2011. 20     It would be useful to highlight an affidavit\n                    that Loh filed in Suit 502 in response to the plaintiff’s application for\n                    an interlocutory injunction (“the LYP Injunction Affidavit”). Loh\n                    had stated in the LYP Injunction Affidavit that JTC required that applicants for\n                    waterfront land commit to investing at least $100m as fixed asset investment to\n                    ensure maximisation of land usage. As will be seen below, the plaintiff relied\n                    on this statement in the LYP Injunction Affidavit to explain to this court its\n                    delay in making the application and also as support for its substantive\n                    application for judicial review. I should add that Loh had explained in his\n                    affidavit filed in these proceedings that his statement in the LYP Injunction\n                    Affidavit was made in the context of an attempt on his part to explain the loss\n                    that JTC would suffer if an interlocutory injunction was granted. Loh explained\n                    that JTC would actually consider a “basket of factors” when\n                    assessing an application for a lease, and not just the applicant’s\n                    proposed fixed asset investment.",
        "The amounts that the plaintiff’s neighbours had committed to\n                investing": "21     According to Leung, the plaintiff discovered\n                    in early October 2010 that its neighbours had obtained a renewal of their leases\n                    even though they had committed to invest at values that were lower than the\n                    amount that the plaintiff proposed. Leung deposed that he discovered that Cosco\n                    Marine Engineering (S) Pte Ltd (“Cosco”), which was granted an\n                    extension of its lease for a period of 30 years, had committed to investing only\n                    $5m over three years without providing a detailed business plan for its future\n                    operations. Another neighbour, Asia-Pacific Shipyard Pte Ltd\n                    (“Asia-Pacific Shipyard”), which was granted an extension of its\n                    lease for a period of 20 years, had committed to investing only $6m over a\n                    period of five years without a specific business plan. 22     JTC responded to Leung’s allegations by\n                    Loh’s affidavit. Loh deposed that Leung’s recounting of the details\n                    of the leases of Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard in Leung’s affidavit was\n                    incorrect and that he did not understand how Leung was in a position to judge\n                    their businesses or business plans since he was not privy to the two\n                    companies’ submissions to JTC. Loh also stressed that Cosco and\n                    Asia-Pacific Shipyard had obtained leases of different plots of land and that\n                    JTC considered every application on its own merits.",
        "Originating Summons No. 1133 of 2010": "23     On 2 November 2010, the plaintiff filed\n                    the application praying,inter alia, for the\n                    following: (a)     leave to apply for a quashing order\n                        to remove into the High Court and quash JTC’s decision to reject the\n                        Renewal Application and to refuse to grant a new lease of the\n                        Premises; (b)     leave\n                        to apply for a mandatory order to oblige JTC to reconsider the Renewal\n                        Application or the plaintiff’s application for a grant of a new lease\n                        of the Premises; and (c)     an order that JTC’s decision rejecting the Renewal Application\n                        or the plaintiff’s application for a grant of a new lease of the\n                        Premises be stayed until the determination of the plaintiff’s\n                        application for a quashing order and a mandatory order or until further\n                        order.",
        "The parties’ submissions": "24     The plaintiff’s arguments in support of\n                    the application were as follows: (a)     Under O 53, r 1(6) of the\n                        Rules, an application for leave to make an application for a quashing order\n                        must be made within three months after the date of the proceedings. The\n                        plaintiff was informed of JTC’s decision not to renew the Lease on\n                        19 May 2010 in the Second Rejection Letter. Therefore, the three month\n                        period prescribed in O 53, r 1(6) of the Rules would have expired\n                        on 18 August 2010. (b)     The plaintiff should not be denied leave because of the\n                        delay. (c)     JTC’s decisions were susceptible to judicial\n                    review. (d)     The\n                        plaintiff had sufficient interest to apply for prerogative orders because it\n                        was the party directly affected by JTC’s decision. (e)     The material before the court had met\n                        the threshold of aprima faciecase of\n                        reasonable suspicion. In particular, the plaintiff raised the following\n                        arguments: (i)       JTC exercised its\n                            discretionary power to lease waterfront land irrationally, unreasonably\n                            and/or in bad faith. (ii)       JTC breached the rules of natural justice\n                            and/or failed to give effect to the plaintiff’s legitimate\n                            expectations. (f)     The plaintiff did not have alternative\n                    remedies. (g)     Finally,\n                        the plaintiff submitted that if the court granted leave, the court also had\n                        the power to order that JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal\n                        Application be stayed. 25     JTC’s arguments against the application\n                    were as follows: (a)     The plaintiff’s explanation\n                        for the delay should not be accepted. (b)     JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal Application\n                        was not justiciable. (c)     The plaintiff did not discharge its burden of establishing aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion\n                        of irrationality, illegality or breach of natural justice on the part of\n                        JTC.",
        "The AG’s submissions": "26     Under O 53, r 1(3) of the Rules, an\n                    applicant for leave to apply for a mandatory order, prohibiting order or\n                    quashing order must serve theex parteoriginating\n                    summons, the statement referred to in O 53, r 1(2) and the supporting\n                    affidavit on the AG. The AG would then have the right to attend and be heard at\n                    the hearing of the application (Chan Hiang Leng Colin and\n                        others v Minister for Information and the Arts[1995]\n                    2 SLR(R) 627 at [4]-[5]; also seeSingapore\n                        Civil Procedure 2007(G P Selvam chief ed) (Sweet &\n                    Maxwell Asia, 2007) (“Singapore Civil Procedure\n                        2007”) at para 53/8/26). 27     The AG intervened in the application and\n                    opposed it on the following grounds: (a)     The plaintiff’s dispute with\n                        JTC was not a matter of public law. Only disputes concerning public law\n                        matters were susceptible to judicial review. (b)     The plaintiff’s application for leave to\n                        apply for a quashing order was filed out of time and the application for\n                        leave to apply for a mandatory order was not made timeously. The\n                        plaintiff’s reasons for its delay were\n                unsatisfactory. 28     The AG also opposed the plaintiff’s\n                    prayer for the court to stay JTC’s rejection of the Renewal Application\n                    and refusal to grant a new lease until the determination of the substantive\n                    judicial review application. The AG argued that the plaintiff’s prayer in\n                    that regard was unsustainable as regards its application for leave to apply for\n                    a mandatory order. This was because O 53, r 1(5) of the Rules which\n                    was the provision that gave the court the power to grant a stay, applied only to\n                    applications for leave to apply for a prohibiting order and a quashing order. In\n                    any case, JTC had already made its decision and so there were no\n                    “proceedings” to be stayed. I did not have to consider this\n                    argument because of the decision to dismiss the application.",
        "The test for whether leave should be granted": "29     A court faced with an application for leave\n                    under O 53, r 1 of the Rules is only required to consider whether the\n                    material before it reveals “aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion” that the applicant would obtain the\n                    remedies that he has sought (“theColin\n                        ChanTest”) (seeChan Hiang Leng Colin\n                        v Minister for Information and the Arts[1996]\n                    1 SLR(R) 294 (“Chan Hiang Leng\n                        Colin”) at [25]\n                    andPublic Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda[2001] 1 SLR(R) 133 at [21]-[22]\n                        (“Linda Lai”) at [21]-[22]; also seeSingapore Civil Procedure\n                        2007at para 53/8/22). 30     I should point out that some recent decisions\n                    have gone further than theColin ChanTest. InYong Vui Kong v Attorney-General[2011]\n                    1 SLR 1 (“Yong Vui Kong”),\n                    the court was willing to fully consider the application for judicial review on\n                    the merits while hearing the application for leave (Yong Vui\n                        Kongat [16]-[19]). A notable feature ofYong Vui Kongwas that the court was not faced with any factual\n                    disputes. The court there was only concerned with pure questions of law that\n                    were fully canvassed (Yong Vui Kongat [16]). There the court found (at [17]) support for this approach in an\n                    observation made by the Court of Appeal inPang Chen Suan v\n                        Commissioner for Labour[2008] 3 SLR(R) 648, at\n                        [56]: 56 We should like to add by way of guidance to judges who hearex parteapplications for leave for judicial review\n                        that the purpose of requiring leave is to enable the court to sieve out\n                        frivolous applications. A case such as the present which clearly raises\n                        issues which require more than a cursory examination of the merits should\n                        have been heard as a substantive application. There is no reason why anex parteapplication such as Pang's could\n                        not have been heardinter partesand disposed\n                        of on the merits as a substantive application. As for this appeal, given our\n                        conclusions on the substantive issues in this case, we indicated to State\n                        Counsel that he should advise the Commissioner that Pang's claim for\n                        workmen's compensation should be processed immediately without the necessity\n                        of another court hearing, at which the Commissioner was bound to\n                        fail. Belinda Ang J inChai Chwan v Singapore Medical\n                        Council[2009] SGHC 115 (“Chai Chwan”) also made observations on the approach to be\n                    taken at the leave stage. She commented on the difficulties of applying theColin ChanTest if the court deciding on the\n                    leave application has had a contested hearing of the application (Chai Chwanat [31]). 31     My view was that it was not appropriate to\n                    adopt the approach inYong Vui Kongfor the\n                    application because of the presence of factual disputes. For example, in\n                    relation to the comments allegedly made at the 16 June 2010 Meeting (see\n                    above at[16]), Loh had deposed that he\n                    could not confirm if Leung’s recounting of the comments was verbatim.\n                    Another example of a factual dispute was the alleged involvement of Keppel\n                    Singmarine (which denied any involvement in JTC’s decision – see\n                    above at[9]). JTC had also disputed the\n                    plaintiff’s evidence on the details of the leases of its neighbours, Cosco\n                    and Asia-Pacific Shipyard (see above at[22]). In the light of such factual disputes, it was not appropriate\n                    for this court to go beyond theColin ChanTest. 32     It is, however, appropriate to consider\n                    whether the decision of JTC was even susceptible to judicial review at the leave\n                    stage. The Court of Appeal inLinda Laiopined\n                    that it was appropriate for the court to consider such an issue because the\n                    susceptibility of a decision to judicial review is a jurisdictional issue\n                        (Linda Laiat [24]; also seeSingapore Civil Procedure\n                        2007at para 53/8/22).",
        "The issues": "33     In arriving at the decision to dismiss the\n                    application, I considered the following issues: (a)     whether this application was made\n                        out of time (“Issue 1”); (b)     if not, whether JTC’s decision to reject the\n                        Renewal Application, or to refuse to grant a new lease, was susceptible to\n                        judicial review (“Issue 2”); and (c)     if so, whether the material before this court\n                        disclosed aprima faciecase of reasonable\n                        suspicion that the plaintiff would obtain the remedies that it had sought\n                        (“Issue 3”).",
        "The decision": "34     I dismissed the application for the reason\n                    that JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal Application, or to refuse to\n                    grant a new lease was not susceptible to judicial review. For completeness, I\n                    will also set out my views on Issue 1 and Issue 3.",
        "Issue 1: whether the application was made out of time": "The law 35     Order 53, r 1(6) of the Rules\n                    provides,inter alia, that leave will not be\n                    granted to apply for a quashing order unless the application for leave is made\n                    within three months after the date of the proceedings, or such other period\n                    prescribed by written law, unless the delay is accounted for to the satisfaction\n                    of the judge hearing the application for leave. The three month period runs from\n                    the time when the right to seek relief arises (seeTeng Fuh\n                        Holdings Pte Ltd v Collector of Land Revenue[2007]\n                    2 SLR(R) 568 (“Teng Fuh\n                    Holdings”) at [17]). 36     Order 53, r 1(6) of the Rules only\n                    refers to applications for leave to apply for quashing orders. JTC, however,\n                    submitted that an application for leave to apply for a mandatory order could\n                    also be precluded on the ground of delay. In support of this submission, JTC\n                    cited a passage fromO’Reilly v Mackman[1983] 2 AC 237 in which Lord Diplock stated the following (at\n                    280-281): … The public interest in good administration requires that public\n                        authorities and third parties should not be kept in suspense as to the legal\n                        validity of a decision the authority has reached in purported exercise of\n                        its decision-making powers for any longer than is absolutely in fairness to\n                        the person affected by the decision. … The AG took a similar view. The AG referred toTeng\n                        Fuh Holdings. InTeng Fuh Holdings,\n                    the Court of Appeal affirmed a dismissal of an application for leave to apply\n                    for a quashing order and a mandatory order on the ground that the application\n                    was made out of time (Teng Fuh Holdingsat\n                        [23] and [42]). 37     My view was that the Court of Appeal inTeng Fuh Holdingsaccepted, at least\n                    impliedly, that a leave application for a mandatory order should also be made\n                    without undue delay. The leave application for a mandatory order inTeng Fuh Holdingsshould have been allowed if the court\n                    considered that such applications could be made regardless of any delay, given\n                    that the court commented that a serious argument could have been made for leave\n                    to be granted if the application had been made in time (Teng\n                        Fuh Holdingsat [42]). I\n                    should add, however, that the three month period prescribed for quashing orders\n                    is not necessarily indicative of whether a leave application for a mandatory\n                    order was made with undue delay since O 53, r 1(6) does not apply to\n                    mandatory orders. The decision 38     The application, so far as it concerned the\n                    quashing order, was certainly made after the three month period prescribed under\n                    O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules. As I noted above (at[35]), the three month period under O 53\n                    r 1(6) runs from the time when the right to seek relief arises. The\n                    application was filed on 2 November 2010. In my view, the plaintiff’s\n                    right to seek relief only arose at the time of the Second Rejection Letter which\n                    was dated 19 May 2010 andnotthe time of the\n                    First Rejection Letter. Although JTC indicated in the First Rejection Letter\n                    that its decision was final, its conduct after that letter suggested that it was\n                    open to reconsidering its decision. A clear indication of JTC’s\n                    willingness to reconsider its decision may be found in its letter dated\n                    29 April 2010 in which JTC informed the plaintiff that EDB and JTC would\n                    jointly review the plaintiff’s business plans and give their joint\n                    assessment in due course. If the plaintiff’s right to seek relief only\n                    arose at the time of the Second Rejection Letter, the application would have\n                    been delayed by two and a half months. 39     However, the mere fact that the application\n                    was delayed was not determinative. I had to consider whether the\n                    plaintiff’s explanation had adequately accounted for the delay (see\n                    O 53, r 1(6) of the Rules and above at[35]). 40     The plaintiff argued that it should not be\n                    denied leave because of the delay for two reasons. First, the delay was only for\n                    a short period that was not comparable to the delay in other cases. Second, it\n                    had a good reason for the delay. The plaintiff explained that it only found out\n                    during the 16 June 2010 Meeting that its business plan fell short of\n                    JTC’s criterion that applicants for waterfront leases must commit to a\n                    fixed asset investment of at least a certain minimum amount. JTC did not state\n                    the minimum amount that it required. Accordingly, the plaintiff did not, at that\n                    time, have sufficient information to determine if JTC’s decision was\n                    irrational. The plaintiff further submitted that it only found out in early\n                    October 2010 that other tenants had obtained renewals of their leases even\n                    though their investments were lower than the amount that the plaintiff had\n                    proposed. The plaintiff subsequently found out, through the LYP Injunction\n                    Affidavit on 15 October 2010, that JTC’s required minimum amount of\n                    fixed asset investment was $100m. The plaintiff submitted that it was only\n                    apparent to the plaintiff at that point that it had grounds for impugning\n                    JTC’s decision. 41     Both JTC and the AG argued that the\n                    plaintiff’s reasons were not satisfactory. JTC argued that the plaintiff\n                    could not rely on information about other companies’ leases because it\n                    must have been apparent to the plaintiff that each transaction was assessed on a\n                    case-by-case basis. JTC also submitted that the plaintiff’s ignorance of\n                    its right to seek relief was not an excuse if it had the means to acquire the\n                    necessary information. The AG asserted that if the plaintiff’s reasons\n                    were accepted, it should only be applying for judicial review on the basis of\n                    differential treatment. It should not also be raising procedural impropriety and\n                    the alleged representations made by EDB. Those matters were known to the\n                    plaintiff within the three month limit. 42     I was of the view that the plaintiff had\n                    satisfactorily accounted for the two and a half months’ delay in making\n                    the application. As a preliminary point, I disagreed with JTC’s submission\n                    that the plaintiff’s ignorance of its right to seek relief was entirely\n                    irrelevant. O 53 r 1(6) of the Rules to my mind was sufficiently broad\n                    to admit an explanation based on ignorance. The question to ask is whether the\n                    explanation was satisfactory to the judge hearing the application. The authority\n                    that JTC cited in support of its argument,Teng Fuh\n                        Holdings, did not stand for the proposition that ignorance is\n                    never an acceptable excuse. 43     InTeng Fuh\n                        Holdings, the applicant had sought a quashing order and a\n                    mandatory order in relation to the respondent’s declaration that the\n                    applicant’s land was to be acquired for “a public purpose, viz:\n                    General Redevelopment” (Teng Fuh Holdingsat [2]). The applicant’s complaint\n                    was that the land was not redeveloped and was rezoned from industrial use to\n                    residential use (Teng Fuh Holdingsat [4]). The applicant’s excuse for its\n                    extended delay in applying for judicial review was that it did not know that its\n                    land was rezoned until September 2004 (Teng Fuh\n                        Holdingsat [8]). The\n                    Court of Appeal rejected this explanation because the information on rezoning\n                    was in the public domain, “accessible to everyone who wanted it”,\n                    since 1993 (Teng Fuh Holdingsat [21]-[22]). In any case, the applicant’s explanation did not\n                    account for the delay in relation to the failure to redevelop the land. In\n                    relation to that complaint, the applicant had actual knowledge of the failure\n                    because it remained in occupation of the land as a licensee (Teng Fuh Holdingsat [20]). The Court of Appeal inTeng Fuh\n                        Holdingsdid not go so far as to hold that ignorance couldneverbe a satisfactory explanation. My view\n                    was that the appellate court simply held that the applicant’s excuse was\n                    not satisfactory because it could easily have found out about the rezoning as\n                    that information was in the public domain since 1993. Arguably, the court might\n                    have reached a different conclusion if the information was not generally\n                    available to the public at large. 44     I felt that the plaintiff had adequately\n                    accounted for the delay. As counsel for the plaintiff (Thio Shen Yi SC) argued,\n                    the alleged discrepancy between the $100m investment commitment that JTC\n                    required and the amounts that Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard had committed\n                    (“the Alleged Discrepancy”) was the “main catalyst”\n                    for the application. The plaintiff only found out about those facts in October\n                    2010. The information on the amounts that Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard had\n                    committed was not generally available to the public at large. The plaintiff only\n                    found out the amount that Cosco had allegedly committed in the course of a\n                    discussion with Cosco about possible business cooperation. As for the amount\n                    that Asia-Pacific Shipyard had apparently committed, the plaintiff only found\n                    out the same by making market inquiries. I accepted that before the plaintiff\n                    discovered, by chance, the amount that Cosco had committed, it had no reason to\n                    suspect that other tenants had committed to investing less than what the\n                    plaintiff had proposed to commit. 45     Admittedly, as the AG pointed out, the\n                    plaintiff relied on not just the Alleged Discrepancy but also on facts that it\n                    alleged gave rise to a legitimate expectation and breaches of the rules of\n                    natural justice. The plaintiff also relied on the conversation that Leung had\n                    with Keppel Singmarine’s Hoe (see above at[8]) as support for its allegation that JTC exercised its\n                    discretionary power to extend or grant leases irrationally, unreasonably and/or\n                    in bad faith. Those facts were known to the plaintiff within the three month\n                    time limit from the date of the Second Rejection Letter. 46     I accepted, however, that the Alleged\n                    Discrepancy was, as the plaintiff’s counsel had submitted, the main\n                    catalyst for the application (see above at[44]). I took this to mean that the plaintiff considered the\n                    Alleged Discrepancy to be its strongest basis for judicial review. I inferred\n                    that the plaintiff probably decided that it had a good chance of succeeding on\n                    the application only after its discovery of the Alleged\n                Discrepancy. 47     Accordingly, I was of the view that the\n                    application, both in relation to the mandatory order and the quashing order,\n                    could not be dismissed on the basis of delay.",
        "Issue 2: whether JTC’s decision to reject the Renewal\n                Application, or to refuse to grant a new lease, was susceptible to judicial review": "The law 48     The leading authority in Singapore on\n                    determining whether a decision is susceptible to judicial review isLinda Lai.Linda Laiinvolved an application by a former civil servant for leave to apply for a\n                    quashing order to quash various decisions by the Public Service Commission\n                    (“PSC”), and other public officials and authorities, that led to\n                    the termination of her employment and for a mandatory order to reinstate her\n                    employment (Linda Laiat [1]). The Court of Appeal allowed the\n                    PSC’s appeal and dismissed Linda Lai’s application on the ground\n                    that the decisions were not susceptible to judicial review for two reasons.\n                    First, the applicant’s complaints concerned PSC’s actions as an\n                    employer and not its performance of “public duties or the exercise of its\n                    powers as an authority” (Linda Laiat\n                        [40]). In other words, the\n                    applicant’s complaints involved breaches of contract, for which the\n                    applicant had her remedies in private law (Linda\n                        Laiat [40]). Second, the\n                    source of PSC’s power in making the decisions that the applicant had\n                    challenged was the contract of employment (Linda\n                        Laiat[44]). The source of\n                    power of the decision sought to be impugned is one of the tests for determining\n                    whether the decision is susceptible to judicial review (“the Source\n                    Test”) (Linda Laiat [41]). If the source of power lies in a\n                    statute, or subsidiary legislation, the decision will be susceptible to judicial\n                    review (Linda Laiat [41]). 49     The Court of Appeal did not suggest that the\n                    Source Test is the only test for determining whether a decision is susceptible\n                    to judicial review. This is evident from the appellate court’s recognition\n                    that the Source Test was “one of the tests” and its citation ofRegina v Panel on Take-overs and Mergers, Ex Parte\n                        Datafin plc And Another[1987] QB 815\n                        (“Datafin”) which considered\n                    that the Source Test was not the sole test (Linda\n                        Laiat [41]). Another\n                    test that may be employed is to determine the nature of the power or function\n                    performed by the body in question (“the Nature Test”) (Datafinat 847): But in between these extremes there is an area in which it is helpful to\n                        look not just at the source of the power but at the nature of the power.If the body in question is exercising public law\n                            functions, or if the exercise of its functions have public law\n                            consequences, then that may, as Mr. Lever submitted, be sufficient to\n                            bring the body within the reach of judicial review. It may be\n                        said that to refer to \"public law\" in this context is to beg the question.\n                        But I do not think it does. The essential distinction, which runs through\n                        all the cases to which we referred, is between a domestic or private\n                        tribunal on the one hand and a body of persons who are under some public\n                        duty on the other. … [emphasis added] The Nature Test requires the court to consider whether the decision\n                    sought to be impugned involved an exercise of “public law\n                    functions”. In fact, the first reason for rejecting the application inLinda Laiseemed to be based on an application\n                    of the Nature Test. The Court of Appeal appeared to have considered that\n                    PSC’s decisions were private in nature because the PSC made those\n                    decisions in a “pure master and servant context” and not in the\n                    exercise of its “public duties or the exercise of its powers as an\n                    authority” (Linda Laiat [40]). 50     To summarise, two tests may be applied in\n                    order to determine whether a decision is susceptible to judicial review. The\n                    Source Test requires the court to consider the source of the respondent’s\n                    power in making the decision that the applicant seeks to impugn. If the source\n                    of power is in a statute or subsidiary legislation, the decision is susceptible\n                    to judicial review. The Nature Test requires the court to consider whether the\n                    respondent’s decision involved an exercise of public law functions. If so,\n                    the decision is susceptible to judicial review. The parties’ arguments and the AG’s arguments 51     The plaintiff argued that JTC’s decision\n                    was susceptible to judicial review for three reasons. First, applying the Source\n                    Test, JTC was exercising a statutory power in rejecting the Renewal Application.\n                    Second, JTC’s decision-making process in relation to applications for\n                    leases or the renewal of leases is important to businesses and the public at\n                    large and should be closely scrutinised by the court. Third, JTC’s\n                    assertion that it was no different from any private landlord contradicted what\n                    Loh deposed in the LYP Injunction Affidavit. The LYP Injunction Affidavit also\n                    raised considerations that a private landlord would not be concerned with. The\n                    plaintiff also relied on Tang’s statement during the 16 June 2010\n                    Meeting that JTC, as a statutory authority, would help the marine industry\n                    during poor economic conditions. 52     JTC submitted that its decision to reject the\n                    Renewal Application was not justiciable for three reasons. First, the JTC Act\n                    does not limit JTC’s discretion in deciding whether to grant or renew a\n                    lease. Second, judicial review is not the plaintiff’s only means of\n                    recourse against JTC. Third, the subject matter of JTC’s decision to\n                    reject the Renewal Application was purely commercial and\n                contractual. 53     The AG submitted that the plaintiff’s\n                    dispute with JTC was not a matter of public law and that only disputes\n                    concerning public law matters were susceptible to judicial review. The AG relied\n                    on both the Source Test and the Nature Test. The AG also referred to Hong Kong\n                    case law on disputes involving leases of state-owned land. The decision 54     In relation to the Source Test, I noted that\n                    the JTC Act conferred JTC with the power to lease land under s 12(2)(d)\n                    which states: (2) The Corporation shall have power to do anything for the purpose of the\n                        discharge of its functions under this Act or which is incidental or\n                        conducive to the discharge of those functions and, in particular, may\n                        — … (d) sell or lease land and premises for the purpose of the discharge of\n                        its functions under this Act upon such terms as the Corporation may\n                        determine; … However, neither the JTC Act, nor any subsidiary legislation made\n                    pursuant to that Act, prescribes the terms on which JTC may lease land and the\n                    considerations that JTC should take into account in exercising its powers. In\n                    fact, s 12(2)(d) of the JTC Act expressly states that JTC may sell or lease\n                    land on such terms as it may determine. It should be noted too that\n                    s 12(2)(d) also provides that the sale or lease of land must be for the\n                    purpose of the discharge of its functions under the JTC Act. JTC’s\n                    functions are spelt out in s 12(1) of the JTC Act: Functions and powers of Corporation 12. —(1) The functions of the Corporation are — (a) to develop and manage sites, parks, estates, townships and other\n                        premises for industries and businesses in Singapore or elsewhere; (b) to provide facilities to enhance the operations of industries and\n                        businesses including social amenities for the advancement and the well-being\n                        of persons living and working in such sites, parks, estates and townships or\n                        otherwise; and (c) to participate in overseas ventures and developments which the\n                        Corporation has the expertise to engage or undertake in. … 55     I decided that the source of JTC’s power\n                    in declining to grant a new lease or rejecting the Renewal Application did not\n                    lie completely in a statute or subsidiary legislation. JTC’s power to\n                    lease was ultimately derived from the JTC Act. Therefore, JTC’s decision\n                    had statutory underpinnings. However, this did not necessarily mean that\n                    JTC’s decision was susceptible to judicial review. As the Court of Appeal\n                    inLinda Laipointed out, it is not necessarily\n                    the case that statutory bodies exercise statutory powers when they make\n                    decisions (Linda Laiat [44]). Every action of a statutory body must,\n                    ultimately, have some basis in the relevant statute. The question is whether, in\n                    the circumstances, the body was exercising statutory powers when it made the\n                    decisions sought to be challenged (seeLinda Laiat [44]). 56     My view was that when JTC decided not to grant\n                    a new lease and not to allow the Renewal Application, it was exercising its\n                    private contractual rights under the Head Lease and the Lease respectively. As\n                    mentioned above (see[54]), the JTC Act\n                    did not prescribe any detailed criteria to guide JTC’s exercise of its\n                    power apart from the general requirement that the exercise had to be “for\n                    the purpose of the discharge of its functions” under the JTC Act.\n                    Instead, JTC, just like any private landlord, came up with its own criteria for\n                    determining whether to grant a new lease. As Loh deposed, JTC used “a\n                    range of qualitative and quantitative factors” to reach its decision. Loh\n                    further deposed that these criteria were not prescribed by any statute or\n                    subsidiary legislation. Indeed, neither party directed me to any statute or\n                    subsidiary legislation that further detailed the criteria that JTC was to take\n                    into account. The source of JTC’s power to stipulate the factors, and its\n                    application of those factors to reach its decisions, must lie in the Head Lease\n                    and the Lease. 57     The Nature Test also led me to conclude that\n                    JTC’s decisions were not susceptible to judicial review. I did not think\n                    that JTC was performing “public law” functions when it decided not\n                    to grant a new lease or to reject the Renewal Application. JTC was not doing\n                    something that a private individual would not be capable of doing. JTC purchased\n                    a lease of land from the State and entered into leases of shorter terms with\n                    tenants like the plaintiff. JTC set its own criteria in deciding whether to\n                    grant new leases or to extend existing leases. Admittedly, as the plaintiff had\n                    argued, JTC’s criteria included non-commercial considerations. However, I\n                    did not think that the mere fact that JTC took into account factors such as the\n                    “quality of jobs generated” and the “value add to the GDP\n                    [Gross Domestic Product] of Singapore” meant that it was exercising a\n                    public law function. Private landowners may also take into account such\n                    non-commercial considerations in deciding whether to lease their\n                land. 58     I found support for my application of the\n                    Nature Test in a Hong Kong authority cited by the AG. InAnderson Asphalt Ltd v The Secretary for Justice[2009]\n                    3 HKLRD 215 (“Anderson\n                    Asphalt”), the Hong Kong Court of First Instance was faced\n                    with an application for judicial review of a public authority’s decision\n                    to grant a short-term waiver of the land use restrictions on certain plots of\n                    land. The court had to consider a preliminary issue of whether the\n                    authority’s decisions were amenable to judicial review. The court\n                    proceeded to extensively review the relevant Hong Kong case law on the subject\n                    (at [38]-[56]). Of particular relevance was the court’s astute\n                    observation that the mere fact that a public authority took into account public\n                    interest considerations does not necessarily mean that the authority’s\n                    decision is susceptible to judicial review (at [78]). The observation was made\n                    in the context of an argument that assumed that the mere fact that the public\n                    authority took into account planning considerations meant that its decision was\n                    amenable to judicial review (at [73]).\n                    The court’s observation (at [78]) is worth reproducing here: Free from authority, again, the fallacy of the argument lies in assuming\n                        that whenever some element of public interest or benefit or some published\n                        public policy is involved, the decision in question must be a public law\n                        one.No, the true question is whether some public\n                            element(s) of sufficient weight is/are present in a particular case so\n                            as to render the function performed a public one, and the decision made\n                            a public law decision amenable to judicial review. [emphasis added] The court’s conclusion (at [79]) was that the public\n                    authority’s decision was not amenable to judicial review.Anderson Asphaltwas affirmed on appeal to the Hong Kong\n                    Court of Appeal (seeAnderson Asphalt and others v The\n                        Secretary for Justice[2010] HKCA 185 at [61] (“Anderson\n                        Asphalt (HKCA)”)). 59     I should mention that a line of cases in Hong\n                    Kong has held that the Hong Kong government’s refusal to renew\n                    “special purpose leases” was amenable to judicial review (seeAnderson Asphaltat [49]-[50] citingHong Kong and China Gas Co Ltd v\n                        Director of Lands[1997] HKC 502 andKam Lan Koon v Secretary for Justice[1999] 3 HKC 591;\n                    also seeAnderson Asphalt (HKCA)at [42]-[51]). I did not think that those cases were relevant because\n                    they turned on rather unique facts. Those cases involved an express policy\n                    statement by the Hong Kong government on how the extension of such special\n                    purpose leases would be dealt with upon the transfer of sovereignty in 1997 (seeAnderson Asphalt (HKCA)at [50]-[51]). 60     I agreed with the observation inAnderson Asphaltthat the mere fact that a public\n                    authority took into account considerations that were public in nature did not\n                    necessarily mean that it was exercising public law functions. Whether the\n                    consideration of such factors would make the public authority’s decision\n                    susceptible to judicial review is ultimately a matter of degree. For the reasons\n                    explained above (see[57]), I felt that\n                    JTC’s decisions in the present case were not sufficiently of a public\n                    nature. JTC was acting as any private landlord would in granting and renewing\n                    leases. 61     In summary, my view was that JTC’s\n                    decisions were not susceptible to judicial review on both the Source Test and\n                    the Nature Test.",
        "Issue 3: whether the material before the court disclosed a prima\n                facie case of reasonable suspicion that the plaintiff would obtain the remedies that\n                it has sought": "62     Given my conclusion that JTC’s decisions\n                    in this matter were not susceptible to judicial review, it was not strictly\n                    necessary for me to consider Issue 3. I will however set out my views on Issue 3\n                    for completeness. The law 63     I have already described the threshold test\n                    that was applied in dealing with the application (see above at[29]). I will now elaborate on the law governing\n                    the grounds of the plaintiff’s challenge. As explained later, the\n                    plaintiff had raised two broad grounds: (i) irrationality; and (ii) procedural\n                    impropriety. I pause here to note that the plaintiff’s claim of procedural\n                    impropriety was essentially a claim that it was deprived of a legitimate\n                    expectation in two respects. First, the plaintiff claimed that it was deprived\n                    of a legitimate expectation that the Lease would be renewed. Second, the\n                    plaintiff alleged that it had a legitimate expectation that it would be able to\n                    make representations to JTC when the latter conducted a fresh evaluation of its\n                    business plans after the First Rejection Letter was issued. The plaintiff argued\n                    that this second legitimate expectation was also defeated. (1)   The law on irrationality 64     The test that is frequently applied to\n                    determine if a decision was irrational is found inAssociated\n                        Provincial Picture Houses Ltd v Wednesbury Corporation[1948]\n                    1 KB 223 (“theWednesburyTest”). The following passage from the decision is helpful (at\n                    229): It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does\n                        that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology commonly used in relation\n                        to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word \"unreasonable\" in a\n                        rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently\n                        used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For\n                        instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct\n                        himself properly in law.He must call his own attention\n                            to the matters which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his\n                            consideration matters which are irrelevant to what he has to\n                            consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be\n                        said, and often is said, to be acting \"unreasonably.\"Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person\n                            could ever dream that it lay within the powers of the\n                            authority. Warrington L.J. inShortv. Poole Corporationgave the example of the red-haired teacher, dismissed because she had red\n                        hair. That is unreasonable in one sense. In another sense it is taking into\n                        consideration extraneous matters. It is so unreasonable that it might almost\n                        be described as being done in bad faith; and, in fact, all these things run\n                        into one another. [emphasis added] It is to be noted that theWednesburyTest has been endorsed in numerous Singapore cases (see, for example,Chan Hiang Leng Colinat [39],Chee Siok Chin and others v Minister\n                        for Home Affairs and another[2006] 1 SLR(R) 582 at\n                    [94] andMir Hassan bin Abdul Rahman and another v\n                        Attorney-General[2009] 1 SLR(R) 134 at [21]). (2)The law on legitimate\n                    expectations 65     In broad terms, a legitimate expectation in\n                    administrative law refers to an expectation that one would be conferred with a\n                    benefit even though one might not have a legal right to that benefit (Council of Civil Service Unions and others v Minister for the Civil\n                        Service[1985] AC 274 at 401 (per Lord Fraser of\n                    Tullybelton)). The term “legitimate expectation” is actually used,\n                    at least in English law, in two contexts (see Lord Woolfet\n                        al,De Smith’s Judicial\n                        Review(Sweet & Maxwell, 6th Edition, 2007)\n                        (“De Smith’s”) at para\n                    12-002). The first context concerns procedural fairness. It would be a ground\n                    for judicial review if the applicant was deprived of a legitimate expectation\n                    without providing him with a fair hearing (see, generally,De\n                        Smith’sat paras 12-003–12-010). In the second\n                    context, the protection of the legitimate expectation extends beyond according\n                    the applicant a fair hearing (see, generally,De\n                        Smith’sat paras 12-011–12-014). The second context\n                    is controversial because of the presence of competing tensions. The need to\n                    check against inconsistent treatment must be balanced against the undesirable\n                    effects of excessively fettering administrative discretion (seeDe Smith’sat para 12-012). The plaintiff seemed\n                    to me to be relying on both aspects of the concept of legitimate expectation\n                    (see above at[63]). 66     I entertain some doubt as to whether the\n                    second understanding of legitimate expectations is part of our law. For our\n                    purpose however it does not matter as neither JTC nor the AG submitted on the\n                    issue of legitimate expectations. The parties’ arguments 67     The plaintiff supported its claim of\n                    irrationality by pointing to four aspects of JTC’s decision-making\n                    process. First, JTC acted inconsistently by extending the leases of Cosco and\n                    Asia-Pacific Shipyard even though they fell short of JTC’s requirement\n                    that its tenants commit to investing at least $100m in fixed asset investment.\n                    Second, JTC took into account extraneous considerations in making its decision.\n                    The criteria that Loh deposed JTC applied in assessing lease renewal\n                    applications did not include a consideration of any arrears by the applicant or\n                    unauthorised subletting on the applicant’s part. Yet, JTC claimed that it\n                    took into account the plaintiff’s previous arrears and unauthorised\n                    subletting in making its decision. Third, Tang’s comments at the 16 June\n                    2010 Meeting (see above at[16]) showed that\n                    JTC’s decision-making process lacked rationality in that it took into\n                    account an irrelevant factor and/or unnecessarily fettered its discretion.\n                    Fourth, the alleged encounter that the plaintiff had with Keppel Singmarine (see\n                    above at[8]) gave the plaintiff a reasonable\n                    suspicion that JTC had acted in bad faith towards the plaintiff. 68     The plaintiff’s arguments on procedural\n                    impropriety have already been summarised above at[63]and need not be repeated. 69     JTC’s response was that the\n                    plaintiff’s allegations of unfair treatment were illogical for two\n                    reasons. First, every case must be assessed on its own merits and so the\n                    plaintiff’s comparison of its treatment with that of its neighbours was\n                    irrelevant. Second, the plaintiff had no basis for its allegation that JTC sent\n                    Keppel Singmarine, or collaborated with it, to threaten the plaintiff. Third,\n                    the plaintiff exaggerated the meaning of the comments made at the 16 June 2010\n                    Meeting. JTC also argued that the plaintiff had an opportunity to be heard\n                    because the Renewal Application and the plaintiff’s appeals against\n                    JTC’s rejection were thoroughly considered. 70     The AG did not make any submissions on Issue\n                    3. The court’s view 71     I was of the view that the plaintiff had\n                    satisfied theColin ChanTest (see above at[29]) in relation to the ground of\n                    irrationality. I thought that the plaintiff’s version of events gave rise\n                    to aprima faciecase of reasonable suspicion that\n                    it would be entitled to the remedies it sought after a full hearing. TheWednesburyTest (see above at[64]) may well be satisfied for at least the\n                    following reason. JTC extended the leases of Cosco and Asia-Pacific Shipyard\n                    even though they did not meet JTC’s apparent criteria on fixed asset\n                    investments. Arguably, no reasonable public authority would act so\n                    inconsistently. I should emphasise that I was assuming that the plaintiff would\n                    be able to establish its allegation that JTC had a definite criteria of\n                    requiring at least $100m in fixed asset investments (see above at[67]). The plaintiff’s allegation in this\n                    respect was not entirely without basis. It was able to point to the LYP\n                    Injunction Affidavit to support its allegation (see above at[20]). I must add, however, that I was aware that\n                    Loh’s affidavit in these proceedings explained that JTC actually\n                    considered a range of factors and not just the amount of fixed asset\n                    investments. Loh also gave an explanation of the context in which he made the\n                    LYP Injunction Affidavit (see above at[20]). His explanation might also be accepted after a full\n                    hearing. 72     As for the ground of judicial review based on\n                    legitimate expectations, I did not think that the plaintiff’s claim that\n                    it was deprived of a legitimate expectation that it could make representations\n                    to JTC satisfied theColin ChanTest. I accepted\n                    JTC’s argument that the plaintiff made several representations to JTC, EDB\n                    and other entities. As I mentioned earlier (see above at[11]), the plaintiff wrote several letters to JTC\n                    and EDB between November 2009 and June 2010. The plaintiff’s broader claim\n                    of a legitimate expectation (i.e. the second\n                    understanding of legitimate expectations set out at[65]), however, satisfied theColin\n                        ChanTest. The plaintiff might be able to convince the court\n                    hearing the merits that the second understanding applied in Singapore. The\n                    plaintiff might also be able to prove that the various representations which it\n                    claimed JTC or EDB made were in fact made. 73     In summary, my view on Issue 3 was that theColin ChanTest was satisfied in relation to\n                    the grounds of irrationality and deprivation of a legitimate expectation that\n                    the Lease would be renewed.",
        "Conclusion": "74     In the final analysis however, it did not\n                    matter that the plaintiff had adequately accounted for its delay or that it had\n                    placed sufficient material before me to raise aprima\n                        faciecase of reasonable suspicion. I dismissed the application\n                    because JTC’s decisions to reject the Renewal Application and not to grant\n                    a new lease over the Premises were not susceptible to judicial\n                review. 75     Consequently, I awarded costs to JTC and the\n                    AG fixed at $3,500 each excluding disbursements which were to be paid by the\n                    plaintiff on a reimbursement basis."
