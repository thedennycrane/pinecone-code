        "Costs between Edmund and Patty": "10 Patty submitted that Edmund should pay costs or part of her costs because he had raised a substantial number of improper and unreasonable issues. I disagreed. 11 The Court should order costs to follow the event except when it appears to the Court that in the circumstances of the case some other order should be made as to the whole or any part of the costs: O 59 r 3(2) of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 2014 Rev Ed). Absent special circumstances, therefore, a successful party is entitled to costs. 12 Edmund succeeded in his oppression claim. He succeeded in proving his version of the terms of the Oral Agreement. The dispute over the terms of the Oral Agreement was a major issue at the trial. Resolution of this dispute also had a bearing on whether certain payments and transactions were wrongful. Further, Edmund substantially succeeded in proving his allegations against Patty in respect of her conduct of the affairs of SMSPL. It was clear that however one analysed the case, Edmund was the successful party in the oppression claim. 13 Edmund also succeeded in most of his claims against Patty for payments to be made by Patty to SMSPL and for Patty to procure SDPL to make payments to SMSPL. Finally, Patty failed in her counterclaim against Edmund. 14 Patty submitted that Edmund unreasonably complicated the proceedings by amending his claim to include unmeritorious claims. Edmund did not succeed in proving all his claims. The reasons are set out in the Judgment. It should also be noted that some of Edmund’s claims were made in the alternative. They became irrelevant when I accepted Edmund’s version of the Oral Agreement. Clearly, Edmund was entitled to make these allegations in the alternative. In my view, Edmund had not acted unreasonably in making the allegations that he did; neither did these allegations unreasonably complicate the proceedings. 15 Patty also submitted that Edmund “multiplied the costs and complexity of the trial” by including all the disclosed documents in his bundles of documents. Whilst this was not desirable, in my view, it did not make the trial more complex. I agreed with Edmund that this issue concerned disbursements, which I directed to be decided by me if parties could not agree on the same. 16 In my view, Patty’s submission that Edmund should pay costs or part of her costs, was wholly unmeritorious and unreasonable. 17 I assessed the total costs at $500,000 to be apportioned among the parties. Edmund’s oppression claim against Patty took centre stage in the trial. A good number of the factual issues in Edmund’s claims against SDPL and SMSPL, and in the counterclaims by SMSPL, overlapped with the factual issues in the oppression claim. 18 In the circumstances, I ordered Patty to pay Edmund the sum of $400,000, being: (a) the costs of Edmund’s oppression action and his claims against Patty; and (b) the costs of Patty’s counterclaim.",
        "Costs between Edmund and SMSPL": "19 Edmund largely succeeded in his claims against SMSPL. SMSPL made numerous counterclaims against Edmund but succeeded in only some of them. As mentioned earlier, nominal damages were awarded in respect of some of the counterclaims by SMSPL. For purposes of costs orders, I did not regard SMSPL as having been successful in respect of claims where only nominal damages were awarded:Mahtani and others v Kiaw Aik Hang Land Pte Ltd[1994] 2 SLR(R) 996 at [57]. 20 In my view, the appropriate order was for Edmund and SMSPL to bear their own respective costs in respect of their claims against each other and I so ordered.",
        "Costs between Edmund and SDPL": "21 SDPL submitted that Edmund ought to pay costs and pointed out that the quantum that the Court ordered SDPL to pay to SMSPL was just 10% of what Edmund had claimed. This was too simplistic an approach. The claims against SDPL are dealt with in the Judgment at [220]–[231]. In my view, overall, Edmund was the successful party. 22 However, Edmund did not succeed in all his claims. In my view, the appropriate order was for SDPL to pay two-thirds of the costs to Edmund. The claims against SDPL overlapped with claims in the oppression action and the dispute over the terms of the Oral Agreement. I fixed the costs at $60,000 on a full liability basis, and thus ordered SDPL to pay Edmund $40,000.",
        "Costs between SMSPL and MOX/Jazz": "23 SMSPL failed in its counterclaim against MOX (the Judgment at [343]). MOX was therefore entitled to costs which I fixed at $25,000. SMSPL also failed in its counterclaims against Jazz. I fixed the costs in Jazz’s favour at $15,000. Edmund submitted that these costs should be borne by Patty because Patty was the person behind SMSPL’s counterclaims. I agreed. 24 InDB Trustees (Hong Kong) Ltd v Consult Asia Pte Ltd[2010] 3 SLR 542 (“DB Trustees”), the Court of Appeal summarised the relevant principles as follows (at [36]): (a) costs orders may be made against non-parties where it is just to do so in all the circumstances of the case; and (b) in assessing whether it would be just to do so, a variety of factors may be relevant but ordinarily, considerable weight would be placed on the presence of two factors,viz, a close connection between the non-party and the proceedings and a causal link between the non-party and the incurring of costs. 25 Examples of a close connection between the non-party and the proceedings include where the non-party either funds or controls the legal proceedings with the intention of ultimately deriving a benefit from them, or where the non-party was responsible for initiating an unwarranted application:DB Trusteesat [30] and [33]. 26 In the present case, Patty was not a party to SMSPL’s counterclaims against MOX and Jazz. However, it was clear that Patty was the one who caused SMSPL to pursue these counterclaims and that she both funded and controlled the same. In my view, Patty’s objective was to throw as many counterclaims at Edmund, MOX or Jazz, as she could come up with, regardless of whether there was a sound basis. 27 The twin requirements of a close connection and a causal link were clearly satisfied. I therefore ordered Patty to bear the costs payable by SMSPL to MOX and Jazz. Conclusion 28 As between Edmund and Patty, I ordered Patty to pay Edmund the sum of $400,000, being: (a) the costs of Edmund’s oppression action and his claims against Patty; and (b) the costs of Patty’s counterclaim. 29 As between Edmund and SMSPL, they were to bear their own respective costs in respect of their claims against each other. 30 As between Edmund and SDPL, I ordered SDPL to pay Edmund costs fixed at $40,000. 31 As between SMSPL and MOX, I ordered Patty to bear the costs payable to MOX, fixed at $25,000. 32 As between SMSPL and Jazz, I ordered Patty to bear the costs payable to Jazz, fixed at $15,000. 33 I directed that Edmund’s, Jazz’s and MOX’s disbursements were to be fixed by me if not agreed between the parties.
