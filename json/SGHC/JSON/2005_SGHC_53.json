        "Pre-trial loss of earnings": "14        The award for $37,870.77 was set out in the Final Judgment as follows: Pre trial loss of earnings                                     :           S$ 37,870.77 -           14 months 4 days (27.04.02 to 30.06.03) = S$21,230.77 -           13 months (01.07.2003 to 01.08.2004)($1,500.00 – $220.00) x 13 months = S$16,640.00 15        The figure $1,500 represents the assistant registrar’s finding on the plaintiff’s pre-accident earnings in Singapore and $220 is the equivalent of the RM500 that the parties agree he is presently earning in Malaysia.[6]The date 27 April 2002 is the date of the accident and 1 July 2003 is the date on which the plaintiff commenced his post-accident employment, while 1 August 2004 probably represents the date of the assessment of damages. 16        This part of the assistant registrar’s findings presents no difficulty that I can see. The defendants’ counsel confirmed that: The Appellants are not disputing the finding of the Lower Court that the Respondent had earned about $1,500 a month at Chuan Fa at the time of the accident. The Appellants are also not disputing that the Respondent’s current wage in Malaysia is RM500 a month (about S$220). Hence, there is no dispute that the Singapore multiplicand should be $1,280.[7] 17        When the $1,500 and $220 and the multiplicand of $1,280 were accepted, that left only the 1 July 2003 date for the commencement of employment in Malaysia that was not agreed to, and no issue was raised over that date in the cross-examination of the plaintiff or in the submissions. 18        In view of the agreement on 85% liability, the award is set at $32,190.15.",
        "Loss of future earnings": "19        The assistant registrar divided the award for lost future earnings into two components. She used 15 years as the multiplier, and applied two multiplicands,ie, $1,280 ($1,500 – $220) for the first ten years and $2,780 ($3,000 – $220) for the next five years. She did not explain why the 15 years were split into ten years and five years, or why two multiplicands were used. 20        When damages for the loss of future earnings are assessed, a projection has to be made of the length of the person’s remaining working life if he had not been injured. In a case where there is a significant number of working years remaining, the earnings/multiplicand can include increases to reflect the normal increments to a workman’s earnings. This is particularly so when the workman is young, and is likely to acquire increased skill, productivity and seniority as he continues to work. 21        There is another factor to be considered. Foreign workers like the plaintiff may not spend their entire working lives in Singapore. They may return home to be with, or start, their families. They may return with their savings from their earnings to start their own businesses. They may also be replaced by cheaper and younger workers, or their work permits may not be renewed. When they leave, they will not continue to get earnings at Singapore levels, and any award for lost future earnings should take this into account. 22        In principle, the multiplier may also be adjusted because social conditions and employment legislation differ among countries, and the length of the working life of a worker in Malaysia, Thailand or Bangladesh may differ from that of a worker in Singapore. This point was not brought up to or considered by the assistant registrar. Consequently, there was no material before her to make any adjustment. In any event, the defendants have accepted the multiplier of 15 years, and the plaintiff has not appealed against it even though counsel submitted that a period of 16 to 18 years was more appropriate.[8] 23        Should the multiplier be split? It should, if the worker is likely to return home before the end of his working life, and if on returning home, his anticipated earnings are different from his anticipated Singapore earnings. In that event, the multiplier will consist of a Singapore part and a “home” part. 24        The plaintiff had not stated in his affidavit of evidence-in-chief or his evidence at the assessment hearing that it was his intention to work in Singapore for a long term or for as long as he was allowed to. His evidence was that after he recovered from his injuries, he did not look for another job in Singapore. 25        It cannot be assumed that every foreign worker wants to, or would be able to, work permanently in Singapore. They have their options and priorities, and they may have to leave against their wishes. Each case has to be looked at on its facts. If a person is 50 years old, and has been working here since he was 20 years old, it can be argued that his employment history indicates that he would stay on. In the plaintiff’s case, where he is only 22 years old, and had worked here for less than two years, the same inference cannot be made. 26        When the assistant registrar apportioned the 15 years into ten and five years, it was not clear if that was based on the projected earning levels over 15 years in Singapore or the projected Singapore/Malaysian working periods. 27        A reasonable approach to this issue is to start by determining how long the plaintiff would have worked if he were not injured. As a carpenter, he may work up to the age of 60. As he was 22 years when the damages were assessed, he could have worked for another 38 years. How long more was he likely to work in Singapore before returning home? I think ten years would be reasonable. The plaintiff would be 32 years old and have savings from working in Singapore for 12 years, and he would be able to return to Malaysia and start his family and his business. 28        However, the full figures are not used in the assessment of damages for loss of future earnings. The contingencies of life (eg, illnesses, other injuries, retrenchment) as well as the fact that the damages are paid at once in one lump sum are taken into consideration, and the full length of projected years of employment is discounted for such contingencies. It is on this basis that although the plaintiff could have worked for 38 more years, the multiplier is set at 15 years, a reduction of 60%. Applying the same considerations, the ten years is scaled down proportionately to four years. 29        Consequently, the damages for lost future earnings should be based on four years’ earnings at Singapore levels and 11 years’ earnings at Malaysian levels. 30        The assistant registrar had worked out the lost Singapore earnings at $1,280 per month, and that was accepted by the defendants. Consequently, the damages for the first four lost years are $61,440 ($1,280 x 4 x 12), or $52,224 at 85%. 31        When the multiplier is split to deal with employment in two countries, two multiplicands should be applied to reflect the earning level of each country. However, the assistant registrar did not do that. She wrote: However, Mr Chai [counsel for the defendants] did not … lead any evidence as to whether a person working as a carpenter in Malaysia would earn a substantially different amount. As such, I proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff would be earning the Singapore equivalent, had he not met with the accident. Mr Chai also did not present any evidence on what a menial labourer in Malaysia could earn. The only figure before me was the $220 the plaintiff earned as a cashier in 2003.[9] The assistant registrar then proceeded on the basis that the plaintiff would return to Malaysia and continue to earn at Singapore levels, and arrived at the multiplicand of $2,780 for the second period of loss. 32        I am afraid that the assistant registrar’s approach was incorrect. The onus was on the plaintiff to prove his loss. When his counsel failed to produce evidence of the earnings of a carpenter in Malaysia, the defendants should not be prejudiced. There was no basis for assuming that earning levels in Singapore and Malaysia are the same. 33        Fortunately, some information became available to me in the course of the appeal, after counsel were directed to make further submissions on whether there should be the split multipliers and split multiplicands. The defendants produced a printout from the website of the Malaysian Industrial Development Authority dated 11 August 2004, which showed that the monthly salaries of non-executives (operators/technicians) in the manufacturing sector range from RM658 (for unskilled workers) to RM878 (for semi-skilled workers) to RM1,643 (for skilled workers/craftsmen).[10]The plaintiff did not produce any Malaysian salary figures. I therefore relied on the information the defendants produced. 34        For the purpose of fixing the Malaysian multiplicand, I take the highest figure of RM1,643, which when converted at the agreed rate of S$1 to RM2.2, is $746.82, and I round it off to $750. While I do not think that the plaintiff was a skilled workman when he was injured, I am prepared to use the highest figure on the assumption that he would have improved his skills by the time of his projected return to Malaysia. His monthly loss for this period is therefore $530 ($750 – $220). On this basis, the loss of earnings for the second 11-year period is $69,960 ($530 x 11 x 12) or $59,466 at 85%. The total award for lost future earnings is therefore $111,690. 35        The defendants, having succeeded in getting the damages reduced, are to have the costs of the appeal.
