        "Pleadings": "5.\n\n        The amended statement of claim started by\n\naverring that all the plaintiffs were members of the Association and that the second\n\nplaintiff was a committee member. It then went on to give a history of the Association.\n\nParagraph 6 of the statement of claim gave the names of all 25 members of the 6thmanagement committee of the Association. It named the second plaintiff and the third\n\nplaintiff as committee members. In paragraph 7, the statement of claim, rather\n\nconfusingly, asserted that the first and second plaintiffs were two of the members of the\n\nduly elected and current management committee. It stated that this committee was elected\n\nat the annual general meeting held on 6 June 1999 and that the tenure of the 6thmanagement committee was due for expiry on 6 June 2001.6.\n\n        Paragraph 8 recited the effect of various\n\nrelevant provisions of the constitution of the Association and this was elaborated on\n\nuntil paragraph 11. In paragraph 12, the plaintiffs contended that in view of the\n\nconstitutional provisions, the terms of the 6thmanagement committee was only\n\ndue to expire on 6 June 2001 and the defendants were prohibited from appointing a new\n\nmanagement committee before then.7.\n\n        By paragraph 13 of the statement of claim, it\n\nwas stated that on 20 May 2000, a notice of an extraordinary general meeting (EOGM) of the\n\nAssociation was given to all members including the plaintiffs. The EOGM was scheduled for\n\n28 May 2000 at 8pm. It was specifically pleaded that the notice and the agenda of the EOGM\n\ndid not state that the sixth management committee would be dissolved and that an election\n\nwould be conducted to elect a replacement management committee.8.\n\n        By paragraph 14, the plaintiffs averred that\n\nthey did not attend the EOGM and came to know on 29 May that members attending the EOGM\n\nhad, contrary to the agenda of the EOGM and the constitution of the Association,\n\npurportedly voted to dissolve the existing and duly constituted sixth management committee\n\nand purported to appoint the defendants as the new management committee (the seventh\n\nmanagement committee). In paragraph 15, it was stated that the members had also purported\n\nto appoint new trustees.9.\n\n        In paragraph 16, the plaintiffs contended that\n\nthe election of the defendants as the seventh management committee and of the new trustees\n\nwas null and void for various reasons. The first of these was that the purported\n\ndissolution of the sixth management committee had not been provided for nor tabled as a\n\nresolution in the agenda for the EOGM and neither was it any part of the agenda for the\n\nEOGM. Further in breach of the constitution, no notice of any proposal to remove the\n\ntrustees from their trusteeship or to appoint new trustees was given. The next paragraph\n\npleaded that the plaintiffs had been denied their right to propose and/or second and/or\n\nelect and/or vote at the EOGM on 28 May.10.\n\n        Paragraphs 18 and 19 of the amended statement\n\nof claim dealt with other matters which were not relevant to the preliminary point. Among\n\nthe reliefs thereafter sought by the plaintiffs were declarations that the appointment of\n\nthe defendants as the seventh management committee was null and void and that the sixth\n\nmanagement committee remained the management committee of the Association.11.\n\n        In their amended defence, the defendants\n\nadmitted that the plaintiffs were members of the Association and that the sixth management\n\ncommittee had been elected on 6 June 1999. This was in paragraph 1. The rest of that\n\nparagraph and paragraphs 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 dealt with the history and practice of the\n\nAssociation. In paragraph 9 the defendants did not admit that the second plaintiff was a\n\ncommittee member and in paragraph 10 the defendants denied that the first plaintiff was\n\never a committee member of the Association. The defendants did not in any of their\n\nparagraphs deny that the third plaintiff was a committee member.12.\n\n        In paragraph 11 the defendants averred that the\n\ntenure of the sixth management committee had been effectively, validly and\n\nconstitutionally terminated by a majority vote which had been taken to dissolve this\n\ncommittee at the EOGM of 28 May 2000.13.\n\n        Paragraphs 8 to 16 are not relevant for the\n\npresent purpose. In paragraph 17, the defendants denied paragraph 12 of the amended\n\nstatement of claim and contended that the ordinary members retained the right to elect a\n\nnew management committee when the sixth management committee had resigned and vacated\n\noffice.14.\n\n        In paragraph 18, the defendants referred to the\n\nagenda for the EOGM and stated that it had been specifically convened to discuss and\n\naddress the problems facing the sixth management committee. Paragraph 19 averred that at\n\nthe meeting the chairman, vice-chairman, secretary and assistant secretary offered to\n\nresign and vacate their offices. These resignations were accepted by the general meeting.\n\nIn paragraph 20, the defendants did not admit paragraph 14 of the statement of claim.\n\nParagraphs 20 and 21 dealt with the appointment of the trustees and in paragraph 22, the\n\ndefendants went on to aver that upon acceptance of the resignation and vacation of key\n\noffice bearers, the sixth management committee had exercised its discretion to dissolve\n\nitself by virtue of clause 24 of the constitution which provided that in the event of any\n\nquestion or matter arising out of any point which was not expressly provided for in the\n\nrules, the committee would have the power to use its own discretion. Paragraph 23 went on\n\nto say that after the sixth management committee had been dissolved, the members had\n\nproceeded to vote for and elect new office bearers. The remaining paragraphs of the\n\ndefence did not bear on the issue argued.",
        "Relevant facts": "15.\n\n        The arguments turned on the sufficiency of the\n\nnotice calling the EOGM. This notice was issued pursuant to a requisition sent to the\n\nchairman of the sixth management committee on 18 May 2000 by some 28 members of the\n\nAssociation. As translated into English, the requisition read:‘With reference to the\n\n    opening ceremony of the temple and other subsequent development matters, as well as\n\n    problems among councillors, I sincerely request that the management committee immediately\n\n    call an \"Urgent Member Meeting\" for discussion.’Consequently, on 20 May the EOGM\n\nwas called. The English translation of the notice of the EOGM read:‘To: all members of the\n\n    templeNotice of Extraordinary General\n\n    MeetingOn the request of 28 members,\n\n    the temple will be holding an extraordinary general meeting at the meeting room of the\n\n    temple at 8.00 p.m. on 28/5/2000 (twenty-fifth of the fourth month of the lunar calendar).\n\n    We hereby invite all members to be punctual for the discussions.Meeting Agenda1)    \n\n    Chairman’s explanation on the reason for the meeting2)    Future\n\n    development of the temple3)    Problems\n\n    between councillors4)    Hiring\n\n    professionals/manager for the temple5)    Report of\n\n    executive committee meeting (29/4/2000)6)    Meeting endsZu-Lin management committee…………………………General Affairs Officer, Tang Kok\n\n    Eng20thMay 2000’16.\n\n        What happened at the meeting in relation to the\n\nposition of the sixth management committee was set out succinctly in the minutes of the\n\nEOGM recorded by Mr Neo Yek Boon (the eighth defendant) from the tape recording of the\n\nmeeting. The first matter discussed was the issue of the board of trustees. After some\n\ndiscussion, four trustees verbally offered to withdraw from the trusteeship to pave way\n\nfor a proper election of trustees by the members. Mr Chan Huang Seng (the first\n\ndefendant), a withdrawing trustee, then proposed to the members that the board of trustees\n\nbe dissolved and that the meeting elect new trustees. This proposal was seconded by Mr Lim\n\nSeng Hoo (the second defendant), another withdrawing trustee. The election was, however,\n\ndelayed as the fifth trustee was apparently on her way to the meeting.17.\n\n        The next event was a discussion of the\n\ninvestment of funds of the Association in certain insurance policies. It was agreed at the\n\nmeeting that the investment must be withdrawn as the money had been donated towards the\n\nbuilding of the temple and not for investment. This discussion was followed by the\n\nsignificant events. As recorded by paragraphs 1.4 to 1.6 of the minutes, what took place\n\nwas:‘1.4 Mr Neo Yit Sui [12thdefendant] said that because of these issues, members have lost confidence with the\n\n    current 6thin-take of committee members. Mr Toh Tong Tiong asked the members\n\n    present whether they sincerely work for and pray for guidance from our Goddess of Mercy\n\n    and requested them to raise their hand if they do. It was a unanimous \"YES\". Mr\n\n    Toh Tong Tiong than read out the advice that the current 6thin-take of\n\n    committee members be dissolved, the board of trustees be dissolved and the election of the\n\n    new 7thin-take of committee members and new board of trustees.1.5 Mr Chan Huang Seng proposed\n\n    and Mr Lim Seng Hoo [2nddefendant] seconded that the current 6thin-take of committee members be dissolved. The dissolution was unanimously accepted by the\n\n    members and Chairman Mr Lim Seng Hock officially announced the dissolution of the current\n\n    6thin-take of committee members and the current board of trustees.’Subsequently, the meeting\n\nproceeded with the election of a new board of trustees and a new management committee. It\n\nshould be noted that whilst Mr Lim Seng Hoo, the second defendant, was also a member of\n\nthe sixth management committee, the proposer of the motion to dissolve that committee, Mr\n\nChan, the first defendant, was not a member of it. He therefore acted as a member of the\n\nAssociation rather than as a member of the committee.18.\n\n        Basically the stand taken by the defendants in\n\ntheir affidavits as to what had happened at the EOGM was somewhat contradictory. On the\n\none hand they relied on the minutes of the EOGM as recorded and translated by Mr Neo Yek\n\nBoon. Those clearly state that the sixth management committee was dissolved by a\n\nresolution passed by the meeting at the instigation of the first and second defendants. On\n\nthe other hand, various deponents stated that during the meeting members of the sixth\n\nmanagement committee resigned voluntarily and as a result there was a vacuum and the sixth\n\nmanagement committee was dissolved. This allegation that the dissolution of the sixth\n\nmanagement committee was prompted by an en-masse resignation was not part of the defence.\n\nAs can be seen from the recital above, the assertion in the defence was that four key\n\noffice bearers had resigned and the management committee had then used its own discretion\n\nto dissolve itself. This assertion was not substantiated by the facts put forward by the\n\ndefendants themselves and therefore could not compensate for any inadequacy in the notice\n\ncalling for the meeting.19.\n\n        Since the minutes were prepared by one of the\n\ndefendants based on tape recordings and were relied on by the other defendants as an\n\naccount of what had happened, they had to be taken as the best record of what had actually\n\noccurred at the EOGM. These minutes show that the sixth management committee was dissolved\n\nby a general resolution of the meeting and not by any action on the part of the committee\n\nitself. Further, since at least one committee member (ie the plaintiff) was absent, there\n\ncould not have been a complete vacation of office by the committee members.20.\n\n        The defendants’ pleadings did not admit\n\nthat the plaintiffs were absent from the meeting. It appeared from their affidavits,\n\nhowever, that they were not able to deny the plaintiffs’ absence. One of the exhibits\n\nto the affidavit filed by the third defendant attached the minutes of the EOGM and the\n\nattendance list bearing the names of all the members of the Association. Those present at\n\nthe EOGM signed against their names. The plaintiffs’ signatures were absent. The\n\nplaintiffs themselves specifically attested that they were absent. On the other hand, none\n\nof the deponents from the defendants specifically attested to the presence of the\n\nplaintiffs at the EOGM. At the beginning of the trial therefore, the plaintiffs’\n\nabsence from the meeting was, in effect, uncontroverted.",
        "The law": "21.\n\n        The law is clear that meetings would be invalid\n\nat the behest of non-attending members if the notices convening them do not specify, with\n\nsufficient particularity, the matters to be discussed and resolved at the meetings. SeeShackleton\n\non the Law and Practice of Meetings(9thEd, 1997) pp 39-43. There are also\n\ncase authorities to similar effect.22.Young v Ladies’ Imperial Club, Limited[1920] 2 KB 523 involved a situation that was very similar to the one before me. There a notice\n\nwas issued convening a meeting of the executive committee of a club. The stated object of\n\nthe meeting was ‘to report on and discuss the matter concerning [the plaintiff] and\n\nMrs Lawrence’. The plaintiff had made some derogatory comments about Mrs Lawrence, a\n\nfellow member, which she had later withdrawn having realised that the comments were\n\nunfounded. She had not apologised, however, and Mrs Lawrence had complained to the\n\nexecutive committee. When the committee sat it decided that the plaintiff’s conduct\n\nwas injurious to the character and interests of the club and recommended that she resign.\n\nWhen the plaintiff failed to resign, the committee erased her name from the membership\n\nrolls. The rule under which the committee acted provided that no member could be\n\nrecommended to resign unless a resolution to that effect had been passed at a meeting\n\nspecially convened for the purpose. The plaintiff’s action to be reinstated was\n\nallowed by the Court of Appeal. The main ground of decision was that notice of the\n\ncommittee meeting had not been given to every member of the committee. Two members of the\n\ncourt also observed that the notice was not a sufficient notice because it had not\n\nspecified that its purpose was to consider whether or not the plaintiff should be\n\nrecommended to resign.23.\n\n        Another case where the sufficiency of a notice\n\nwas considered wasKaye v Croydon Tramways Company[1898] 1 Ch D 358. There, a\n\nnotice convening a meeting of shareholders of the selling company to consider an agreement\n\nmade by the selling company to sell its undertaking to another company omitted reference\n\nto a fact that a substantial sum would be payable to the directors of the selling company\n\nas compensation for loss of office. It was held that the notice did not fairly disclose\n\nthe purpose for which the meeting was convened and did not comply with s 71 of the then\n\ncurrent UK Companies Act. The company was restrained from carrying the agreement into\n\neffect until it had been sanctioned by the shareholders at a meeting duly convened for the\n\npurpose.",
        "The decision": "24.\n\n        In the present case, there was nothing in the\n\nnotice that indicated the purpose of the meeting was to remove and replace trustees and/or\n\ncommittee members. If that was what was intended by item 1 of the agenda, ie\n\n‘Chairman’s explanation of the meeting’ or by item 3 ‘Problem between\n\nCouncillors’ as averred in the defence, the intention was not effectively conveyed.\n\nThe phraseology of the two items was too vague and general to bring home to the mind of\n\neach and every member that what was being aimed at was a complete re-structuring of the\n\nadministration of the Association.25.\n\n        The plaintiffs did not attend the meeting.\n\nTheir evidence was that they did not think that anything momentous was to be discussed and\n\ntherefore did not attend. It is not necessary, however, to rely on such evidence to find\n\nthe notice to be inadequate. A discussion of problems amongst councillors does not\n\nnecessarily imply a wholesale removal of all members of the committee concerned. For that\n\nmatter it does not even imply the removal of those members who are having problems inter\n\nse.26.\n\n        As far as the defendants were concerned,\n\nneither their pleadings nor their evidence properly addressed the issue of the sufficiency\n\nof the notice. Their comments in their affidavits to the effect that the plaintiffs were\n\nnot interested in the Association’s affairs could not be regarded as an answer to the\n\nallegation of insufficiency of notice. Their allegation of a mass resignation was\n\ncontradicted by their own minutes. In any case as the third plaintiff was absent, he had\n\nnot resigned and his removal could only have been effected by the resolution passed for\n\nthe dissolution of the sixth management committee so that allegation was unfounded and\n\ncould not serve as a defence to the plaintiffs’ claim.27.\n\n        The plaintiffs were entitled to be told exactly\n\nwhat business was to be transacted at the meeting. If they had known that the intention\n\nwas to remove the trustees and the sixth management committee (including the two\n\nplaintiffs who sat on it), they would have been able to make an informed decision as to\n\nwhether or not they would attend the meeting. Since no indication of such a purpose was\n\ndisclosed on the notice, the plaintiffs were deprived of their right to attend and\n\ncontribute to the discussion and participate in the voting that took place.28.\n\n        In this regard, the following passage fromShackletonis helpful:‘Whether a notice is\n\n    sufficient must be decided on the facts of each case. A crucial test is whether it\n\n    contains enough information to enable the recipient to decide for himself whether he\n\n    should attend, or appoint a proxy on his behalf, or whether he is content to let matters\n\n    take their course at the meeting: to enable him \"to decide for himself whether he\n\n    should do any more.\"’ (at p 41)29.\n\n        In my judgment, the notice calling the EOGM\n\nplainly failed the crucial test. It gave no hint to the plaintiffs or anyone else not in\n\nthe know that there would be a motion to remove the sixth management committee and to\n\nreplace it with a new committee. It also did not allow the plaintiffs to decide whether\n\nthey should attend or whether they were content to let matters take their course. Even if\n\nthey were not adverse to the removal of the sixth management committee, the plaintiffs or\n\nany of them might have wanted to stand for election as members of the replacement\n\ncommittee or as new trustees. They did not have the opportunity to decide whether they\n\nshould attend the meeting for this purpose. In my judgment, therefore, the notice was bad\n\nand the actions taken could not be validated notwithstanding that a majority of the\n\nmembers of the Association had voted in favour of them. I therefore gave the plaintiffs\n\nthe declarations asked for.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGESINGAPORECopyright © Government of Singapore."
