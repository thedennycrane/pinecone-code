        "The facts": "5 On the night of 7 July 2001, the\n\nappellant received a call from his brother-in-law informing him that his estranged wife\n\nwas about to commence divorce proceedings against him. This news saddened him and the\n\nappellant consumed some beer.6 Soon after, the appellant’s close\n\nfriend who was facing similar marital problems, Ms Rajee, telephoned the appellant and\n\ninformed him that she had received several threatening phone calls from loan sharks. She\n\ntold the appellant that she could no longer handle her problems and was thinking of taking\n\nthe lives of her children and then ending her own life. The appellant pleaded with her not\n\nto do anything foolish but she hung up abruptly. Thereafter the appellant tried several\n\ntimes to contact Ms Rajee but the latter refused to answer the telephone. The appellant\n\nstarted to worry that Ms Rajee was serious about carrying out her threat and he became\n\nfrantic. He got into his car and drove towards Ms Rajee’s house. En-route, however,\n\nthe appellant was stopped by the Traffic Police along Ang Mo Kio Ave 5 for speeding.\n\nSmelling alcohol in his breath, the appellant was made to undergo a breathalyser test by\n\nthe police officer. He failed. Following a Breath Evidential Analyser (\"BEA\") at\n\nTraffic Police Headquarters, it was revealed that the proportion of alcohol in his breath\n\nwas 64 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath, exceeding the prescribed limit which is\n\n35 micrograms per 100 millilitres of breath.7 At the court below, the appellant\n\npleaded guilty to the above-stated charges.",
        "The decision below": "8 In his written judgment, the trial judge\n\nfound that there was no real threat to Ms Rajee from the loan sharks. He noted fromWilkinson’s\n\nRoad Traffic Offences(18thed, volume 1 at page 1119 paragraph 21.49) that\n\nbefore the English High Court would recognise that an emergency is capable of amounting to\n\na ‘special reason’, the defendant must first show that there was no other\n\nalternative but for him to drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative\n\nbefore driving. The judge held that there were no extenuating or pressing circumstances in\n\nthis case. He also held that the appellant had not considered other forms of transport,\n\nnor did he attempt to resolve the emergency by other means such as by contacting the\n\npolice or emergency services. As such, he concluded that there were no ‘special\n\nreasons’ that should excuse the appellant from an order of disqualification.9 Even though it was unnecessary for him\n\nto go on, the judge noted the words of Lord Widgery CJ inTaylor v Rajan[1974] RTR\n\n304:… the discretion where special\n\n  reasons are found should only be exercised in clear and compelling circumstances, that in\n\n  deciding whether to exercise their discretion, the justices should have regard to the way\n\n  in which the car was driven, and that they should have regard to the defendant’s\n\n  level of alcohol.10 As such, he held that, even if\n\n‘special reasons’ existed, he would not have been minded to exercise his\n\ndiscretion not to disqualify the appellant for 12 months.",
        "Appeal against sentence": "11 In his petition of appeal, the\n\nappellant contended that the judge erred in holding that his driving whilst under the\n\ninfluence of drink in the attempt to save Ms Rajee and her children did not amount to\n\nextenuating or pressing circumstances which constituted ‘special reasons’ for\n\nthe purposes of s 67 (2) of the Act. Also, the appellant contended that the judge erred in\n\nholding that, even if there were ‘special reasons’, he would not have exercised\n\nhis discretion not to disqualify him. The appellant argued that the judge ought to have\n\nexercised discretion in his favour in view of the extenuating or pressing circumstances.\n\nHe appealed to set aside the disqualification order.",
        "Special reasons": "12 The first question arising in the\n\nappeal was whether the facts surrounding the commission of the s 67(1)(b) offence were\n\nextenuating or pressing circumstances that amounted to ‘special reasons’. It was\n\nthus necessary to examine the provisions of s 67(2) of the Act, which states:A person convicted of an offence under\n\n  this section shall, unless the court for special reasons thinks fit to order otherwise and\n\n  without prejudice to the power of the court to order a longer period of disqualification,\n\n  be disqualified from holding or obtaining a driving licence for a period of not less than\n\n  12 months from the date of his conviction or, where he is sentenced to imprisonment, from\n\n  the date of his release from prison.13 It is therefore clear that s 67 (2) of\n\nthe Act requires the existence of ‘special reasons’ before the court has power\n\nnot to make the minimum mandatory disqualification order of a period of 12 months as\n\nprovided under the Act.14 InR v Crossen[1939] 1 NI 106,\n\nit was held that a ‘special reason’ may comprise:… a mitigating or extenuating\n\n  circumstance, not amounting in law to a defence to the charge, yet directly connected with\n\n  the commission of the offence and one which the court ought properly to take into\n\n  consideration when imposing punishment …15 This passage was quoted and approved by\n\nLord Goddard inWhittall v Kirby[1946] 2 All ER 552 and subsequently followed in\n\nlocal decisions includingPP v Balasubramaniam[1992] 1 SLR 822andJoseph\n\nRoland v PP(1996) 1 SLR 179. It is clear that whether the facts of the case amount to\n\n‘special reasons’ is a question of law and should be decided in view of the\n\ncircumstances surrounding the offender’s commission of the offence.16 In the instant case, the prosecution\n\nnever disputed the facts alleged by the appellant. As such, I was prepared to accept the\n\nappellant’s version of events, in particular, his reason for driving whilst under the\n\ninfluence of drink. He had no reason to doubt Ms Rajee’s determination to carry out\n\nher threat to take the lives of her children and herself. With the magnitude of risk, that\n\nis, the three lives at stake and the fact that he was the only person who was aware of Ms\n\nRajee’s threats and resolve, the appellant must have felt compelled to take drastic\n\naction, including driving in his inebriated state.17 While the factual matrix of this case\n\nwould certainly weigh heavily on a trial judge’s mind in support of a finding of\n\n‘special reasons’, unfortunately for the appellant, this did not dispose of the\n\nmatter. Before an emergency is capable of amounting to a special reason under law, a\n\ncrucial prerequisite is for the offender to show that there was no alternative but for him\n\nto drive, and that he had explored every reasonable alternative before driving (See e.g.Evans\n\nv Bray[1977] RTR 24,R v Baines[1970] Crim LR 590).18 At the time of the commission of the\n\noffence, the appellant was clearly depressed and upset over his marital problems. In the\n\ncircumstances, he had probably overreacted when he could not contact Ms Rajee after she\n\nhung up abruptly. As the judge noted, he did not attempt to notify the police or any of\n\nthe other emergency services. Before me, he tried to explain that, even though he knew how\n\nto get to Ms Rajee’s residence, he could not remember her exact unit number. However,\n\nI rejected his explanation. A cool and sober mind would have deduced that volunteering\n\ninformation such as Ms Rajee’s telephone number to the police and/or emergency\n\nservices would have enabled them to trace her exact address and take necessary action to\n\nabate the threat, if any. In fact, the appellant did not even stop to consider or attempt\n\nto procure other means of transport. By his own admission, the thought of taking a taxi\n\nover to her house did not even cross his mind. Clearly, he could have done a great deal\n\nmore before getting into his car on impulse and driving to Ms Rajee’s house.19 Next, the prosecution submitted that\n\nthe facts of the present case were different from the example I gave inJoseph Roland,where\n\nI considered that rushing a seriously ill wife to the hospital were urgent and critical\n\ncircumstances constituting ‘special reasons’. Their argument was that firstly,\n\nMs Rajee was merely a friend of the appellant. Also, Ms Rajee had unduly felt threatened\n\nafter merely receiving verbal threats over the telephone from loan sharks. They submitted\n\nthat there was no credible evidence to show that the threats would actually be carried out\n\nand that such circumstances cannot be so extenuating and pressing as to warrant the\n\nappellant to drive whilst inebriated.20 In my opinion, it was irrelevant that\n\nMs Rajee was only the appellant’s friend. Section 67 (2) of the Act does not require\n\na special relationship nor does it require an imminent threat of physical harm to an\n\noffender’s kin. While I agreed with the prosecution that there was no threat of\n\nphysical harm emanating from the loan sharks, the material threat that motivated the\n\nappellant to drive was not from the loan sharks, but from Ms Rajee’s threat to take\n\nher own life and the lives of her children. The legislature’s aim of granting a\n\ndiscretion to the trial judge is to tamper the rigidity of a mandatory disqualification by\n\nallowing the judge to take into account relevant factors which appeared to demonstrate\n\nwhether a situation was extenuating or pressing enough to amount to ‘special\n\nreasons’. I did not think that it was necessary to limit a judge’s discretion by\n\nconfining it to certain factors.21 Taking into account the circumstances\n\nof the case, I was not satisfied that the facts were sufficient to amount to ‘special\n\nreasons’ under law.",
        "Discretion": "22 In any case, even if ‘special\n\nreasons’ were established, it did not automatically follow that the appellant would\n\nnot be disqualified. There must be a separate process of considering whether the\n\ndiscretion must be exercised in favour of the offender (SeePP v Balasubramaniam,supraat 827). This view is also supported by the wording of s 67(2) of the Act and has always\n\nbeen the approach of the English courts in similar cases (See for exampleDPP v\n\nO’Connor(1992) 96 Cr App R 135 at 146).23 InPP v Balasubramaniam, supra,Karthigesu J emphasised that the judge, in deliberating over whether to exercise\n\ndiscretion in an offender’s favour, must pay special regard to the legislative intent\n\non s 67(2) of the Act. He stated at 829:… It seems clear to me that the\n\n  legislative intent is that those who choose to drink and drive must be prepared to suffer\n\n  a minimum period of a disqualification of 12 months should they exceed the prescribed\n\n  limit of alcohol in their blood …, but at the same time the legislature has\n\n  recognised that there may exist certain extenuating or pressing circumstances which may\n\n  prevail upon the driver to take the risk of driving knowing that he was not fit to drive\n\n  due to the presence of alcohol in his body. It is in this kind of situation when the\n\n  offence is committed under some extenuating or pressing circumstances that the court is\n\n  given the discretion not to disqualify or to disqualify for a lesser period than 12\n\n  months.24 It is clear that Parliament regards\n\ndrink driving offences so seriously as to warrant an almost mandatory minimum period of 12\n\nmonths’ disqualification. However, in order to properly exercise the discretion\n\nbestowed by act of Parliament, it is helpful to refer toMV Balakrishnan v PP[1998] 3 SLR 586at 590, where I quoted fromRe Kanapathipillai[1960] MLJ 243 H:Magistrates must appreciate that where\n\n  there is a duty to disqualify a convicted person from holding a licence to drive a motor\n\n  vehicle … such duty falls not within the discretion of the convicting court but is\n\n  imposed by the act of the legislature. This duty is not identified with the maximum\n\n  punishment to be mitigated according to established principles. The duty is mandatory but\n\n  the act of the legislature has given a limited discretion to a convicting court, to be\n\n  exercised judicially, to refrain from implementing the law’s clearly expressed\n\n  requirement for a reason which is special to the offence but not for a reason special to\n\n  the offender…25 In my opinion, the limited discretion\n\nnot to disqualify can only be made in very exceptional circumstances, having regard to the\n\nspecial circumstances as well as to the whole of the circumstances surrounding the\n\ncommission of the offence. In the English case ofTaylor v Rajan(1974) RTR 304,\n\n340, Lord Widgery CJ stated that, in considering the whole of the circumstances of the\n\ncase, a sentencing court was required to:…have regard to the manner in\n\n  which the defendant drove, because if he committed traffic offences, such as excessive\n\n  speed or driving without due care and attention, this again is a consideration which tells\n\n  against his having the discretion exercised in his favour, and they should generally have\n\n  regard to whether the defendant acted responsibly or otherwise….Last, but by no means\n\n  least, if the alcohol content in the defendant’s body is very high, that is a very\n\n  powerful reason for saying that the discretion should not be exercised in his favour…26 In the instant case, the judge noted\n\nthe high concentration of alcohol in the appellant’s blood. At 64 micrograms per 100\n\nmillilitres of breath, this was more than 1.8 times above the prescribed limit of 35\n\nmicrograms per 100 millilitres of breath. The appellant was caught speeding at 133 kmph\n\nalong Ang Mo Kio Ave 5, which is a residential area with a speed limit of 60 kmph. The\n\noffences were also committed on a late Saturday night when the likelihood of people\n\nreturning home from a night out was much higher. Undoubtedly, he posed a serious danger\n\nnot only to himself but also to other road users and pedestrians.27 While the appellant’s conduct was\n\nprobably indicative of his anxiety to ensure the safety of Ms Rajee and her two children,\n\nthis should not detract one from the fact that he was speeding whilst under the influence\n\nof drink. Even if an inebriated person faces an emergency which is so extenuating or\n\npressing as to warrant the taking of a calculated risk by driving, it cannot be\n\noveremphasised that that person must do so responsibly, keeping well within the speed\n\nlimits and making an extra effort to drive safely. The appellant not only failed to\n\nappreciate that he was in no position to drive, but went so far as to speed at 133 kmph in\n\na 60 kmph residential zone in his inebriated state. This was clearly inexcusable. Hence,\n\neven if there was a finding of ‘special reasons’ in this case, the whole of the\n\ncircumstances did not merit a judge exercising his discretion in the appellant’s\n\nfavour.",
        "Final sentence": "28 Roads in Singapore have to be made as\n\nsafe as possible for law-abiding road users and pedestrians. In cases of drink driving,\n\nthe courts are always mindful that a motor car in the hands of an inebriated person is a\n\npotentially devastating weapon. InPP v Mohd Isa[1963] MLJ 135, Thomson CJ stated\n\nthat the most satisfactory penalty for most motoring offences is disqualification because\n\na fine is paid once and then forgotten. In this case, the 12 months’ disqualification\n\norder would mean that for the entire year in which the order is in effect, the appellant\n\nis reminded every day of his offence and the unwarranted risks in which he had placed\n\nordinary members of the public. I believe that a lengthy period of disqualification from\n\ndriving would be the most appropriate sentence for such offenders.29 In coming to the appropriate period of\n\ndisqualification that was to be imposed, the judge was entitled to take relevant factors\n\nin the appellant’s mitigation plea into account. The appellant had no antecedents,\n\nand had pleaded guilty and co-operated fully with the police. These are recognised\n\nmitigating factors. Further, regardless of whether ‘special reasons’ were found,\n\nthe court should also have regard to the motivation leading to the commission of the\n\noffence, which, in this case arose out of the appellant’s concern and anxiety for the\n\nlives of a close friend and her two children. As such, I felt that the combined punitive\n\neffect of the fine as well as the 12 months’ disqualification period was an\n\nappropriate sentence.",
