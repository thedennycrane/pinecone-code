        "Conclusion": "The above analysis compels me to conclude that no leave is required for the appeal and that the rejection of notice of appeal was improper. When the district judge heard arguments on the question of leave she should have accepted the contention of the wife`s Counsel that no leave was required and allowed the appeal to proceed as of right. This did not happen because the reason given by the Counsel was wrong. She did not rely on s 77 of the Charter.Accordingly, I assert and exercise the authority under s 37(5) read with s 22(2) of the Judicature Act as well as the general supervisory and revisionary jurisdiction under s 27 of the Judicature Act and direct and order that the appeal be allowed to proceed. The wife should be allowed to refile her rejected notice of appeal and prosecute the appeal in accordance with the Rules.Order on costs below is cancelled. Respondent (husband) shall pay $500 for the costs below and $500 for the costs of appeal.Outcome:Appeal allowed.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
