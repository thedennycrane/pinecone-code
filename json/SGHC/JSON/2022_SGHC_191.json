        "The appellant’s submissions": "16 The appellant submits that the respondent’s sentence of 7 months’ imprisonment is both wrong in principle and manifestly inadequate and should be enhanced to at least 11 months’ imprisonment. 17 The central plank to the appellant’s submissions is that the DJ failed to appreciate that – in instructing Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift knowing that the K Forklift had faulty brakes and Shanmugam was not competent to operate the forklift – the respondent’s culpability should be at least on par with Shanmugam’s culpability. In so far as the respondent’s act of permitting Shanmugam to operate the forklift cannot be artificially divorced from Shanmugam’s subsequent mishandling of the forklift, the DJ accorded too much weight to the fact that the respondent was not the proximate cause of the incident.7Foot Note 7×Appellant’s Submissions dated 5 August 2022 (“AS”) at [33]–[50]. 18 In this connection, the DJ’s finding cuts against parliamentary intent animating the WSHA,viz, that supervisors have a crucial role to play and need to lead by example and ensure the safety of their workers as well as the High Court’s observations inMaoandNurun Novi Saydur Rahman v Public Prosecutor and another appeal[2019] 3 SLR 413 (“Nurun”) that a supervisor is expected to be responsible for the safety of the workers under him and may be found to be of greater culpability when he commits breaches of the WSHA.8Foot Note 8×AS at [36]–[41].The appellant submits that the DJ’s decision may lead to rank-and-file workers suffering heavier penalties than their supervisors because they are held to have directly caused workplace accidents.9Foot Note 9×AS at [51]. 19 Additionally, the appellant contends that the DJ accorded inadequate weight to the fact that the respondent made a conscious and active decision to instruct a supervisee to work unsafely, had previously done so on multiple occasions and had been involved in the development of Risk Assessments which cautioned against the very breach of safety he committed.10Foot Note 10×AS at [44]–[45], [57(b)]. 20 In conjunction with the fact that the DJ placed insufficient emphasis on the potential harm of the appellant’s actions and failed to consider that even if the faulty brakes did not contribute to the accident, it reflected a greater disregard for safety on the respondent’s part,11Foot Note 11×AS at [44]–[52], [58]–[65].the appellant submits that appellate intervention is warranted. The respondent’s submissions 21  On the other hand, the respondent submits that the DJ correctly assessed the respondent to be less culpable than Shanmugam. The respondent was charged with allowing Shanmugam, an untrained forklift operator, to operate the K Forklift. This was at least a step removed from the deceased’s death. Moreover, the respondent did not actively encourage Shanmugam to act in a dangerous manner and could not have reasonably foreseen or prevented Shanmugam from stepping on the accelerator when the K Forklift was not in neutral gear.12Foot Note 12×Respondent’s Submissions dated 5 August 2022 (“RS”) at [15]–[26]. 22 Next, the respondent was not in charge of maintaining the forklifts at the work site. In any event, the faulty brakes had nothing to do with the accident (it was undisputed that Shanmugam had mistakenly depressed the accelerator pedal of the K Forklift and did not apply the brakes when the forklift surged forward) and at best went towards assessing potentialharm(which the DJ had already pegged as high).13Foot Note 13×RS at [46]–[49]. 23 Finally, the sentence of seven months’ imprisonment accords withMaoandPublic Prosecutor v Chong Chee Boon Kennethand other appeals[2021] 5 SLR 1434 (“Kenneth Chong”). In the latter regard, the respondent contends thatKenneth Chongis instructive in demonstrating that the culpability of a supervisor can be lower than that of a primary offender, particularly when the supervisor is “more removed” from the harm that eventuated.14Foot Note 14×RS at [69]–[98].   My decision 24 Preliminarily, both the appellant and the respondent do not take issue with the sentencing framework set out by the DJ. As I alluded to earlier, the DJ had adapted the sentencing framework set out inMaoto deal with offences under s 15(3) of the WSHA. I note that this accords with the High Court’s provisional view inPublic Prosecutor v Manta Equipment (S) Pte Ltd[2022] SGHC 157 (“Manta”) that the two-stage sentencing approach set out inManta(which is consistent with the approach adopted inMao) “should in principle apply toallPart 4 offences punishable under s 50 of the [WSHA]” (at [39]). 25 As parties have not made submissions on the propriety of the appellant’s proposed sentencing ranges for the various sectors in the sentencing matrix governing offences under s 15(3) of the WSHA (which the DJ relied on), I make no finding on this. It suffices to note that Shanmugam’s sentence of 11 months’ imprisonment is not the subject of the present appeal and the key question for present purposes is whether the DJ correctly assessed the culpability of the respondent and particularly vis-à-vis Shanmugam’s. 26 Before leaving the issue of the appellant’s proposed sentencing matrix for offences under s 15(3) of the WSHA, I make one observation. I caution against any notion that “the sentence ranges for high level of culpability should generally be reserved for wilful acts”.15Foot Note 15×GD at [78].Wilfulness and recklessness are dichotomous legal concepts but no bright line distinction can be drawn between the twomentes reaein assessing the culpability of an offenderat the sentencing stage. Each case turns on its own facts (see alsoJali bin Mohd Yunos v Public Prosecutor[2014] 4 SLR 1059 at [36]). 27 Set against this backdrop, I find that the DJ erred in assessing the respondent’s culpability to be lower than Shanmugam’s. Though Shanmugam was the individual who negligently stepped on the accelerator of the K Forklift, this cannot be neatly divorced from the fact that the respondent – as Shanmugam’s supervisor – allowed Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift knowing that the latter was not trained or competent to operate the forklift and that the forklift had faulty brakes. To draw a water-tight distinction between the respondent permitting Shanmugam to use the forklift and Shanmugam’s subsequent act (in the manner that the DJ had done) accords insufficient weight to first, the working relationship between the respondent and Shanmugam and second, the fact that it is reasonably foreseeable that an untrained and uncertified operator may make mistakes and cause accidents while operating a forklift.16Foot Note 16×Appellant’s Supplemental Submissions dated 8 August 2022 at [7].In the former regard, it is undisputed that Shanmugam worked under the supervision of the respondent. In this connection, the DJ implicitly recognised the influence that the respondent had over Shanmugam’s reckless act; she observed that Shanmugam “was authorised and instructed by [the respondent]” and did not operate the K Forklift “on a frolic of his own”.17Foot Note 17×Record of Proceedings (“ROP”) at p 28. 28 The DJ’s assessment of the acts of the respondent and Shanmugam also unjustifiably attenuates a supervisor’s culpability for facilitating a supervisee’s reckless act. It is pertinent to note that (a) the legislative intent of the WSHA was to improve workplace safety by effecting a cultural change for employers and other stakeholders to take proactive measures to prevent accidents; and (b) the scope of liability under s 15(3) of the WSHA was intended to be a broad one, imposing a duty on multiple persons at work to ensure the safety or health of themselves and others (Maoat [40] and [47]). Thus, during the Second Reading of the Workplace Safety and Health Bill (Bill No 36/2005) – through which Parliament promulgated s 15(3) of the Workplace Safety and Health Act 2006 (“WSHA 2006”) (which isin pari materiato s 15(3) of the WSHA) – then Minister for Manpower, Dr Ng Eng Hen observed that under the liability regime introduced by the WSHA 2006, “responsibility for the safety and health of others will lie not only with employers, but also with employees, whether they be supervisors or rank-and-file workers” (Nurunat [57]). I find that the DJ’s evaluation of the relative culpabilities of the respondent and Shanmugam cuts against the public interest in ensuring that persons who hold positions of authority under the WSHA (and who, for this reason, are likely to have greater influence over workplace practices) act in a manner that respects the safety of their supervisees. 29 For the avoidance of doubt, my holding in this regard should not be (mis)construed as a pronouncement that supervisors will invariably be equally or more culpable than supervisees where the latter acts in a reckless manner. Again, each case turns on its own facts. In the present case, the constellation of factors, including the working relationship between the respondent and Shanmugam and the fact that the respondent permitted Shanmugam to operate a faulty forklift on multiple occasions knowing that Shanmugam lacked the training to do so, militates in favour of a finding that the respondent’s culpability was, minimally, on par with Shanmugam’s. 30 Next, I also find that the DJ placed undue weight on the fact that the faulty brakes did not materially contribute to the accident.18Foot Note 18×GD at [111]–[112].I note that there is some uncertainty as to whether the Statement of Facts the respondent admitted to stated that Shanmugam did not utilise the brakes to the K Forklift “as he knew the brakes were faulty”.19Foot Note 19×GD at [109].I am prepared to find, in the respondent’s favour, that the Statement of Facts merely stated that Shanmugam did not step on the brakes of the K Forklift given that the Prosecution accepted that the faulty brakes “did not directly result in the accident itself” during oral submissions.20Foot Note 20×ROP at p 24.That said, even if the proximate cause of the accident was Shanmugam mistakenly stepping on the accelerator, one must be alive to the reality that the risk of an untrained individual erroneously operating a forklift with malfunctioning brakes is significantly higher than the commensurate risk of this individual operating a functioning forklift. Whilst the respondent’s counsel submits that the issue of the faulty brakes is relevant only to an assessment of potential harm and which the DJ had already pegged as high,21Foot Note 21×RS at [30]–[31], [42]–[49].I find to the contrary. That the respondent knew that the forklift had malfunctioning brakes and still permitted Shanmugam, an untrained individual, to operate it, heightens his culpability as a supervisor. This is inasmuch as culpability includes a consideration of the nature of the unsafe act (Maoat [64(a)(ii)]). 31 Finally, in my view, the decision inKenneth Chongis of limited assistance to the respondent. First,Kenneth Chongis not a decision involving workplace safety. Rather, Chong and Nazhan, who had sanctioned the continuance of ragging through their inaction (in contradistinction to Fatwa and Farid who actively encouraged ragging and made sure that the servicemen of Tuas View Fire Station submerged the victim in the pump well), were convicted of offences under s 338(a) of the Penal Code (Cap 224, 2008 Rev Ed). The legislative intent animating the WSHA, in particular to ensure that all stakeholders would be held responsible for workplace safety (Nurunat [57]), is a consideration that was not germane on the facts ofKenneth Chong. Second, while Chong, Nazhan and the respondent were each one step removed from the act(s) that eventually resulted in the death of the victims, the respondent, unlike Chong and Nazhan, had directly contributed to the initial unsafe state of affairs by permitting Shanmugam to operate the K Forklift. 32 For completeness, I briefly deal withPublic Prosecutor v Wong Kiew Hai and others(DSC 900150/2018 & Ors) (“Wong Kiew Hai”), a decision which was accompanied by the District Judge’s brief oral remarks. Before me, the respondent’s counsel submitted that the fact that the natural persons subject ofWong Kiew Hai, namely Wong and Yee, received sentences of eight and ten months’ imprisonment respectively even though they committed reckless acts under s 15(3) of the WSHA which contributed to the death of one worker and injuries to ten others suggested that the respondent’s sentence of seven months’ imprisonment was fair and just. I am unable to accept this submission. It must be remembered that the District Judge had reduced Wong and Yee’s respective sentences by three months to account for the fact that a more culpable co-accused person, one Robert Tjandra, had earlier been sentenced to approximately 12 months’ imprisonment on the authority ofNurun(which was subsequently disapproved byMao).22Foot Note 22×Appellant’s Bundle of Documents and Authorities dated 5 August 2022 at pp 197–198.   33 For the above reasons, the sentence of seven months’ imprisonment imposed by the DJ on the respondent is manifestly inadequate. I enhance the sentence to 11 months’ imprisonment.      Vincent Hoong Judge of the High Court     Isaac Tan and Norine Tan(Attorney-General’s Chambers) for the appellant; Sunil Sudheesan and Khoo Hui-Hui Joyce (Quahe Woo & Palmer LLP) for the respondent."
