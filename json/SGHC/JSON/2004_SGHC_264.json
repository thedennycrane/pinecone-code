        "Findings": "63        I find on a review of the evidence, that Arawana was a progression from mySTOR-1000/Eagle, and that it was conceived and worked on in April/May 2000 at the latest. 64        I reject the plaintiff’s claim that work on the Invention only started on 3 July, but even if it did, the intellectual property arising out of the work undertaken between 3 July and 17 July, when he was employed by Omni, belonged to the company. 65        My findings are reinforced by the questionable conduct of the plaintiff and his wife in not informing the directors of Omni of the defendant’s offer, and in not listing mySTOR-1000/Eagle in the assets of Omni in its winding up. It showed that they did not have the interests of Omni at heart when they realised that the company might not be able to carry on its operations, and that they were acting to advance their own interests instead. 66        I accept Watkin’s opinion that mySTOR-1000/Eagle is substantially similar to the Invention, and I find that by the terms of his service agreement with Omni, the plaintiff did not have the full title to the Invention or the Patent Application that he purported to assign to the defendant. 67        In the result, I find in favour of the defendant on the preliminary issue and order that the plaintiff pay costs to the defendant for the proceedings before me. The parties are to return before me for directions on the conduct of the rest of the action that may be needed.
