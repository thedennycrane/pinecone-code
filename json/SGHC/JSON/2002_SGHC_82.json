        "(1) Whether there is jurisdiction in rem against the \"ALEXANDREA\"": "18. When faced with an application of this nature, it is for the\n\narresting party to show on a balance of probabilities that the action is within the in rem\n\njurisdiction of the Court.19. In order to be entitled to bring an action in rem against the\n\n\"ALEXANDREA\", the Plaintiffs must establish:(i) that the claim is within the scope of s 3(1)(l) of the Act;(ii) that the claim arises in connection with a ship;(iii) the 2-stage test in s 4(4) of the Act - that is to say, satisfy\n\n  the in personam and in rem test.(See: Selvam J in The\"Opal 3\"[1992] 2 SLR 585at 590)",
        "(i)Section 3 (1) (l)- \"any claim in respect of goods or materials\n\nsupplied to a ship for her operation or maintenance\"": "20. The Plaintiffs’ submission is that Court has jurisdiction to\n\nhear and determine this claim under s. 3(1)(l) of the Act.21. Mr. Sin contended that the words \"in respect of\" in par.\n\n(l) should be substituted for the words \"arising out of\". InThe\n\n\"Indriani\"[1996] 1 SLR 305, the words \"arising out of\" were\n\ninterpreted widely to mean \"connected with\". On this wide interpretation, par.\n\n(l) would cover the Plaintiffs’ claim in tort even though there was no contractual\n\nrelationship between the Plaintiffs and the owners of \"ALEXANDREA\".22. Such an approach, he stated, would be in keeping with several\n\ndecisions of the Court of Appeal (such asThe \"Trade Fair\"[1994] 3 SLR 827\";Alexander GTsavliris & Sons Maritime Co v Keppel Corp\n\nLtd[1995] 2 SLR 113) where some provisions of s. 3(1) of the Act were given a\n\nwide and liberal construction. Mr. Sin argued for a wider admiralty jurisdiction.23. The Court of Appeal inThe \"Trade Fair\"construedthe word ‘for’ in s. 3(1)(f) of the Act as bearing the wider\n\nmeaning of ‘arising out of’. Mr. Sin referred to the speech of Lord Brandon inThe\n\n\"Antonis P Lemos\"[1985] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 283 which was relied on by\n\nKarthigesu JA inThe \"Trade Fair\".Karthigesu JA at p 832 of the\n\nreport observed:\"Lord Brandon in delivering the main speech in the House of Lords\n\n  remarked (see p 289) in relation to s 20(2) of the 1981 Act that he ‘never\n\n  understood’ why the expression ‘arising out of’ appearing in the convention\n\n  was not used for all claims listed under s 20(2) but only to three of them (as is the case\n\n  under s 3(1) of the Act)…..In any case, Lord Brandon said that in compliance with the\n\n  convention the words ‘arising out of’ should apply to all the maritime claims\n\n  and that these words should be construed as having the meaning ‘connected with’.\n\n  Although the issue in The Antonis P Lemos was concerned with s 20(2)(h) of the 1981 Act,\n\n  it is plain to us that Lord Brandon’s remarks were directed to all the maritime\n\n  claims listed under s 20(2). \"24. As far as par. (l) is concerned, there is no need to construe the\n\nwords \"in respect of\" as \"arising out of\". The words \"in respect\n\nof\" in themselves import a broad rather than a restrictive meaning to the activities\n\ndescribed in that provision.25. Tamberlin J inThe \"Sydney Sunset\"[2001] FCA 210 in considering s4(3)(m) of the Admiralty Act 1988, which is for \"a claim in\n\nrespect of goods, materials or services (including stevedoring and lighterage services)\n\nsupplied or to be supplied to a ship for its operation or maintenance\", as well as\n\nother provisions stated:\"12. At the outset it should be noted that the words \"in\n\n  respect of \" [in par. (m)] and \"in relation to\"[in par.(n) and par. (s)]\n\n  …are words of extension concerning the expression \"a claim\" and therefore\n\n  it is not appropriate that the definitions be read in any unduly narrow or restricted\n\n  sense. They should be given their ordinary and plain meaning without any reservations as\n\n  to the limitation of their interpretation.\"26. I agree with the observations of Tamberlin J. The words \"in\n\nrespect of\" are wide words and I agree that they should not be unduly restricted:The\n\n\"Kommunar\"(No 1)[1997] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 1 at p 5;The\n\n\"Edinburgh Castle\"[1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 363 at p 362. Claims to be\n\nindemnified for monies advanced to enable goods or materials to be supplied to a ship, or\n\nmonies paid to third parties for the supply of goods to a ship were held by the English\n\nCourts to come within the English equivalent of this statutory provision. Again, inThe\n\n\"Nore Challenger\" and \"Nore Commander\"[2001] 2 Lloyd’s\n\nRep. 103, the word \"goods\" was construed to include the supply or provision of\n\ncrew.27. That said, par. (l) plainly contemplates a defined link between the\n\nclaim and the goods or material supplied to a ship (\"the primary ship\"); a\n\ndefined link between goods or materials supplied with the operation or maintenance of the\n\nprimary ship.28. Not only must the supply be to a \"ship\" as defined in s\n\n2(1) of the Act (and not, for instance, a seaplane), the supply must under par. (l) be\n\nmade to an identified ship.29. The House of Lords inThe \"River Rima\"[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 193 held that the provision [par. (l)] applied only where the\n\ngoods or materials are \"supplied\" to a ship which is identified either in the\n\nsupply contract or prior to its performance. The word \"supplied\" includes supply\n\nby way of hire as well as sale.30.The \"River Rima\"underlines the mixed fact\n\nand law preconditions that must exist between the claim under par. (l) and the primary\n\nship.31. InThe \"Lloyd Pacifico\"[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 54, Clarke J ( as he then was) applying the reasoning inThe\n\n\"River Rima\"to a claim under par. (h), held that to bring an action in\n\nrem, the contract of carriage must relate to an identifiable ship. In that case, the\n\ncontract of carriage was of containers containing coffee or other cargo to be agreed by\n\nthe parties on the shipping services operated by them.32. It is settled law that \"any claims arising out of any\n\nagreement relating to the carriage of goods in a ship or to the use or hire of a\n\nship\" in s 3(1)(h) would include claims whether founded in contract or tort.33. In the context of an identifiable ship as explained by Clarke J,\n\nthe tortious act or omission would relate to either the primary ship in which the goods\n\nare carried or intended to be carried, or the ship alleged to have been used or hired.34. Similarly, on the ordinary and natural meaning of the words used in\n\ns 3(1)(l) and by parity of reasoning, in my view, par. (l) would be wide enough to cover\n\nclaims framed in tort but only where the wrongdoing relate to or is referable to the\n\nprimary ship supplied with goods or material for her operation or maintenance.35. As to the types of cases in tort that could be covered under par.\n\n(l), undoubtedly each case would be required to be decided on its own facts. Suffice it to\n\nsay that what comes immediately to mind are claims in tort against the ship-owning\n\ninterest of the primary ship as bailee of goods or material supplied. Another possibility\n\ncould be claims for malicious or injurious falsehood to protect the claimant’s\n\ninterest in his property or trade or economic interest generally.36. For completeness, I would mention that Sheen J inThe\n\n\"River Rima\"[1987] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 107 had to decide whether par.\n\n(m) of theAdministration of Justice Act 1956[which is pari materia to s\n\n3(1)(l) of the Act] covered a claim for damages for conversion in respect of containers\n\nthat were leased to the owners of the \"River Rima\" and damages for breach of\n\nclause 8 of the lease agreement.37. The arguments proceeded each step of the way right up to the House\n\nof Lords on the assumption that the claim framed in tort was within the ambit of par. (m).38. There is no room for the unduly wide construction argued for by\n\nCounsel for the Plaintiffs. S 3(1)(l) is thus an obstacle in the way of the Plaintiffs,\n\nwhich arises from the construction of the words in par. (l) and application to the facts\n\nof this case.39. My conclusion on par. (l) is sufficient to dispose of this appeal.\n\nNevertheless, I shall express my views upon the question relating to s 4(4) of the Act in\n\ncase this matter should be considered by a higher Court.",
        "(ii)Does the claim arise in connection with a ship? - Section 4(4) of the Act": "40. As stated, the existence of admiralty jurisdiction depends on s\n\n3(1) of the Act; but the availability of an action in rem depends upon s 4.41. S 4(1) makes it clear that admiralty jurisdiction may exist and be\n\nexercisable by an action in personam without an action in rem being available. The action\n\nin rem may be invoked only in the cases mentioned in sub-ss (2) to (4) of s 4 of the Act.42. Another point referred to earlier as essential to establishing a\n\nright of arrest, which I have to decide in this appeal, is whether the Plaintiffs’\n\nclaim arose in connection with the \"ALEXANDREA\".43. Mr. Dason submitted that, even if, the Plaintiffs’ claim fell\n\nwithin par. (l), the Plaintiffs are unable to bring an action in rem because they cannot\n\nbring themselves within sub-s (4) of s.4 of the Act.44. He stated that \"ALEXANDREA\" was the \"carrying vessel\n\nengaged by the physical supplier [Meridian] to deliver bunkers to \"FRONT\n\nMELODY\". The words \"in connection with a ship\" in s 4(4) must refer to the\n\nsame ship as is mentioned in s 3(1)(l) and that ship was \"FRONT MELODY\". The\n\narrest of the \"ALEXANDREA\" was improper in that she was not the ship with which\n\nthe claim under s 3(1)(l) arose.45. Mr. Dason referred me toThe \"Eschersheim\"[1976] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 1. The leading opinion of the House was given by Lord Diplock\n\nwith whom the other Law Lords agreed. Lord Diplock at p 7 after setting out the relevant\n\narrest provision said:\"It is clear that to be liable to arrest a ship must not only be\n\n  the property of the defendant to the action but must also be identifiable as the ship in\n\n  connection with which the claim made in the action arose (or a sister ship of that ship).\n\n  The nature of the \"connection\" between the ship and the claim must have been\n\n  intended to be the same as is expressed in the corresponding phrase in the convention\n\n  \"the particular ship in respect of which the maritime claim arose. One must therefore\n\n  look at the description of each of the maritime claims included in the list in order to\n\n  identify the particular ship in respect of which a claim of that description could\n\n  arise.\"46. Mr. Dason also relied onThe \"Lloyd Pacifico\"[1995] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 54. Clarke J (as he then was) at p 57 said:\"..The claim must arise out of an agreement relating to the\n\n  use or hire of a ship or to the carriage of goods in a ship and the claim must arise in\n\n  connection with a ship. The ship in the two sections [ss 20(2)(h) and 21(4) of Supreme\n\n  Court Act 1981] is the same ship.\"47. Whilst agreeing that there is no material difference between the\n\nprovisions of theAdministration of Justice Act, 1956 and those of theSupreme\n\nCourt Act1981 so far as relevant to matters under consideration in this appeal,\n\nMr. Sin said that Lord Diplock’s comments on the class of ships liable for arrest\n\nwere not part of the ratio decidendi, and that the construction of s. 3(4) [our s4 (4)]\n\nwas obiter dicta. The Court of Appeal inThe \"Permina 108\"[1975-1977] SLR 221 did not followThe Eschersheim.48. Mr. Sin submitted that both par. (l) and s 4(4) should be construed\n\nwidely. He put forward the contention that it would be absurd to give a wide and liberal\n\ninterpretation to the provisions of section 3(1) and not do the same for s 4(4).49. The question must ultimately turn on the true construction of s\n\n4(4) of the Act.50. As I understand it, Mr. Sin wanted the Court to read sub-section\n\n4(a) in this way:\"In any case of any such claim as mentioned in paragraph (d) to (q\n\n  ) of subsection (4) of s 4 of this Act [ -and this is a claim under s 3(1)(l) -]\n\n  being a claim in connection with a ship [ -this is a claim arising in connection with\n\n  \"ALEXANDREA\" -] where the person who would be liable on the claim in an\n\n  action in personam [ -JS Pink would be so liable- ] was, when the cause of action\n\n  arose, the owner or charterer of or in possession or in control of the ship [ -JS Pink\n\n  was the owner of ALEXANDREA\" -], the Admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court\n\n  may (whether the claim gives rise to a maritime lien on the ship or not) be invoked by an\n\n  action in rem against (a) that ship [ -ALEXANDREA -] if at the time when the\n\n  action is brought it is beneficially owned as respects all the shares therein by that\n\n  person [ -which is the case -].\"51. This suggested reading is difficult to accept. I can find nothing\n\nin the Act to lend support to Mr. Sin’s contention. It involves a strained\n\nconstruction of the sub-section.52. Sub-section 4 provides that an action in rem can be invoked only if\n\nthe claim is \"a claim arising in connection with a ship\". It is\n\nreferring, in my view, to a ship in respect of which a maritime claim as specified in s\n\n3(1)(d) to (q) arises. This is undoubtedly so as s 3(1)(d) to (q) of the Act operates\n\ntogether with s 4(4) to the extent that it gives effect to that arrest provision.53. It is clear that \"a ship\" in the phrase \"being a\n\nclaim arising in connection with a ship\"in sub-section 4, is the same ship to\n\nwhich goods or material were supplied in s 3 (1)(l). The term \"a ship\" as used\n\nin s 3(1)(l) is given the like meaning as that term when used within s 4(4)(a), namely\n\n\"a ship\", \"the ship\", \"that ship\". I am supported in my\n\nreading of the sub-section by both Donaldson LJ inThe \"Span Terza\"[1982] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 225 at p 229 and Clarke J inThe \"Lloyd\n\nPacifico\".54. Giving the words used in sub-s 4(a) their ordinary and natural\n\nmeaning, on the facts of this case, I hold that the ship in connection with which the\n\nPlaintiffs’ claim arose is the \"FRONT MELODY\". The Plaintiffs have been\n\npaid by SCEP for the bunkers. Mr. Sin conceded that the indemnity sought is essentially to\n\ncover any eventual liability to SCEP.55.The\"Permina 108\"also reinforces my\n\nreading of sub-s 4. WithThe\"Permina 108\", the fundamental\n\nrule for the arrest of a ship under the Act in respect of certain classes of maritime\n\nclaims, namely pars. (d) to (q) of s 3 (1) was not confined to just sister ships in common\n\nbeneficial ownership with the primary ship in respect of which the claim arose but was\n\navailable against any ship owned by a charterer liable in respect of a maritime claim.56. In that case, the \"IBNU\" was time chartered to the\n\ndefendants and the claimants as owners of \"IBNU\" arrested the \"PERMINA\n\n108\" which was in the ownership of the defendants in a claim for non-payment of\n\ncharter hire. The Court of Appeal clearly regarded the \"IBNU\" as the ship in\n\nconnection with which the claim under s 3(1)(h) arose. See alsoThe\n\n\"Tychy\"[1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 11 at p 17 for the same approach.57. On the facts of this case, \"ALEXANDREA\" was not the ship\n\nin connection with which the claim arose. That conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the\n\nappeal without considering the further ground of appeal which is the question relating to\n\nalleged material non-disclosure.Wrongful Arrest58. As for the Defendants’ application for damages for wrongful\n\narrest to be assessed, there was, in my view, no evidence to show that the arrest wasmalicious\n\nas put forward by the Defendants.Result59. The Plaintiffs having failed to establish jurisdiction in rem\n\nagainst \"ALEXANDREA\" in respect of their claim, I accordingly allowed the appeal\n\nand set aside the Writ of Summons and warrant of arrest. The Plaintiffs are to pay the\n\nDefendants costs of the appeal and below fixed at $4,500.Sgd:BELINDA ANG SAW EANJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
