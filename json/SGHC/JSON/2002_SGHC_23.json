        "Introduction": "The two appellants, Mohammed Zairi Bin Mohamad\n\nMohtar (‘Zairi’) and La Ode Indra Karnain Bin Jomain (‘Indra’) were\n\ncharged, together with two other persons, Subramanian s/o Annamalai (‘Subra’)\n\nand Mohammed Ali Bin Elias (‘Ali’), before Mr Gilbert Low in the\n\nmagistrate’s court of voluntarily causing hurt to one John s/o Vettamooto\n\n(‘John’). All four accused persons were junior officers of the Singapore Prison\n\nEmergency Action Response (‘SPEAR’) force trained in riot control, suppression\n\nof illegal activities and the escorting of high-risk prisoners. The charges against the\n\ntwo appellants read as follows:You,…Are charged that you on or about the 13thday of January\n\n  2000, between 6.30 pm to 6.45 pm, at the toilet of Ward 34, Changi General Hospital,\n\n  Singapore, and in furtherance of the common intention of you all did voluntarily cause\n\n  (sic) hurt to one John s/o Vettamooto, to wit, by fisting on this face, and you have\n\n  thereby committed an offence punishable under section 323 read with Section 34 of the\n\n  Penal Code, Chapter 224.Both appellants were sentenced to nine months’ imprisonment and\n\nappealed against both conviction and sentence. I dismissed the appeal and now give my\n\nreasons.",
        "The facts": "2 The complainant, John, was an inmate who had been convicted and\n\ndetained at Jalan Awan Prison for drug possession. On 9 January 2000, he was admitted to\n\nChangi General Hospital suffering from severe asthma attacks. His condition was apparently\n\nso bad that he required intubation and mechanical ventilation and was warded at the\n\nIntensive Care Unit for several days. On 11 January 2000, he was extubated and then\n\ntransferred to the prison ward in the hospital (ward 34) where he occupied bed no.8. At\n\nthat time, the ward was guarded around the clock by the SPEAR force. The guards were\n\ndivided into three shifts; the morning shift from 8 am to 3 pm, the afternoon shift from 3\n\npm to 10 pm and the night shift from 10 pm until the next day. On 13 January 2000, the\n\nsecond appellant Indra was on the morning shift together with Ali while the first\n\nappellant Zairi was to take over in the afternoon together with Subra. However, the shift\n\nchange only took place at about 6.20 pm that day because Indra and Subra had to undergo\n\ntraining which ended late.3 It was undisputed that John was involved in an argument with one\n\nGeorge s/o Chinnakannu (Cpl George) on 12 January 2000. John took offence over the latter\n\nusing the word \"Dei\" on him, which he considered derogatory and told Cpl George\n\nto call him by his name and not ‘dei, dei’. Other than this incident, there was\n\nno other trouble between John and the guards during the morning shift on 13 January 2000.\n\nIt was from this point on that the prosecution’s version of facts differed from that\n\nof the defence.",
        "The Prosecution’s version of facts": "4 According to John, trouble began when Subra and the first appellant\n\nZairi commenced duty at 6.20 pm when he was eating his dinner. Subra came to the entrance\n\nof the ward and shouted to him, asking whether his name was John to which John replied in\n\nthe affirmative. Subra then told John \"you eat first, later you know\" and\n\nreturned to the guardroom. Once John finished his dinner, all four guards, Subra, Zairi,\n\nAli and Indra entered the ward even though John had not called out for them. Subra was\n\nholding a pair of handcuffs and he uncuffed the leg-cuffs of John and told him to get out\n\nof the bed before fastening one end of the handcuffs on his left hand. The other end was\n\nheld by Subra. Subra then led John into the toilet while the other three guards followed\n\nbehind.5 In the toilet, Subra handcuffed John’s left hand to the left\n\nrailing of the toilet before cuffing John’s right hand to the same railing with a\n\nlong cuff such that John was now bent over the toilet bowl. Subra then asked John what he\n\nwanted now, to which John replied by asking if it was wrong to ask someone to call him by\n\nhis name. Subra then punched John on his left jaw. Zairi delivered a second punch. John\n\ntestified that Ali and Indra also joined in to punch him. This first assault lasted for\n\nseveral seconds until John tried to get up and ask Subra why he had tied him and hit him.\n\nIn reply, Subra only started to punch him in earnest. This was the second assault. A punch\n\nlanded on the left side of John’s mouth causing one of his teeth to break and an\n\nother to be dislodged. John was enraged and attempted to fight back but Subra held onto\n\nhis right handcuff and Zairi and Indra then punched and kicked him. Ali who was behind\n\nshouted \"don’t see\" to one of the other prisoners who was lying on one of\n\nthe beds near the entrance of the toilet. The entire sequence of events lasted for about\n\nfour minutes before the four guards left John in the toilet shouting for help.\n\nSubsequently, Zairi, Ali and Indra returned and tried to force John to bath and to change\n\ninto fresh clothes. John resisted and refused to do so until he had seen the doctor. The\n\nfour guards finally left him alone in the toilet. They returned about 15 to 16 minutes\n\nlater to bring him back to his bed. When they returned, Subra unlocked the handcuffs and\n\nasked John \"How now?\" to which John replied that he would see him in court for\n\nthis.6 At about 7 pm, Staff Nurse Grace Annie Vijayarani Stephens\n\n(‘Staff Nurse Grace’) entered the ward to give the patients their normal\n\nmedication. None of the SPEAR force had informed her that John had been injured. She only\n\nheard John shouting for the nurse when she was entering the ward. She saw that John was\n\nbleeding at the mouth and nose. John said that he had been assaulted but he did not\n\nmention any names. Before entering the ward, Staff Nurse Grace said that she had asked\n\nSubra what had happened to John and the latter had replied that an inmate had suddenly\n\nturned violent, and it had become necessary to subdue him. She called a doctor, Dr Loh Zhi\n\nMing (\"Dr. Loh’) to attend to John. According to Dr. Loh, John was very agitated\n\nand persistently wanted to make a police complaint regarding the assault. He also\n\ncomplained of pains and tenderness on the left side of his body, the left side of his head\n\nbelow the ear, his eyes, nose, mouth, shoulders and back. Dr Loh subsequently tendered a\n\nmedical report detailing the injuries that had been sustained by John. According to this\n\nreport, John suffered a cephalo hematoma at the left mastoid region (swelling in the\n\nregion behind the left ear), an uprooted left upper incisor with a blood clot in the\n\nsocket, and a dislodged left upper incisor and mild tenderness over his lower cervical\n\nspine and both scapulas. A supplementary medical report was also tendered stating that the\n\ninjuries sustained by John could have been caused by fists.",
        "Prosecution witnesses’ version of facts": "7 The two prosecution witnesses Zainali Bin Yahya (‘Zainali’)\n\nand Lim Chye Tze (‘Lim’) were prisoners warded together with John in ward 34 on\n\n13 January 2000. Both Zainali and Lim testified that on the day in question, Subra had\n\napproached John at about dinnertime, even though John had not shouted or indicated that he\n\nwished to visit the toilet. Zainali said that Subra called out to John but, as John was\n\nstill eating, Subra told him to continue eating and then left. Lim testified in largely\n\nsimilar terms that Subra had scolded John with Tamil vulgarities, asked John to finish his\n\nfood quickly and then left. Both were also sure that, once John had finished his meal, the\n\nofficers entered the ward and ‘forced’ him to go to the toilet. Subra had\n\nuncuffed John’s legs before handcuffing John’s hands behind him. Lim further\n\nsaid that he heard Subra rebuking John, \"yesterday you were quite arrogant\".8 However, Lim and Zainali differed as to the identities of the persons\n\nwho led John handcuffed to the toilet. Zainali testified that Subra and Zairi entered the\n\ntoilet with John while Ali waited at the entrance and Indra only entered the ward to take\n\na look before leaving the ward. Conversely, Lim said that it was Subra, Zairi and Indra\n\nwho pulled John into the toilet, hitting him on the head as they were doing so. Both also\n\ntestified to having heard ‘sounds of fighting’ emanating from the toilet before\n\nthe officers left the ward leaving John alone in the toilet. Zainali described it as the\n\nsound of punches and something hitting the wall. Lim said he heard thumping sounds from\n\nthe toilet together with John’s shouts for help. Lim also added that he heard John\n\ncontinue to shout for help and that, when the guards returned later to bring John back to\n\nhis bed, John had blood on his body and blood oozing from his mouth with two or three\n\nteeth missing.",
        "The Defence’s Case": "9 The defence’s case was essentially one of denial that the\n\nalleged assault had ever taken place. All four officers testified that it was John who\n\nwanted to go to the toilet, however he suddenly turned violent in the toilet when Subra\n\nattempted to cuff his left hand to the toilet railing. This necessitated the use of\n\nControl and Restraint Techniques (‘C & R’) and the formation of a three-man\n\nC & R team to subdue him. Force was exerted in the process because John was struggling\n\nviolently, hence resulting in his bodily injuries. Therefore they did not voluntarily\n\ncause hurt to John but were merely acting within the scope of their official duty as\n\nwarranted by the circumstances.",
        "Testimony of the first appellant Zairi": "10 The first appellant Zairi testified that he was warned by Ali to\n\nkeep an eye out for John in bed no. 8, as he was argumentative and rude to the officers.\n\nAs part of the process of taking-over, Zairi said that he entered the ward to check on the\n\nprisoners and to ask each one of them for their personal particulars. He alleged that John\n\nsimply stared at him without replying when he came to his bed. This incident was reported\n\nto Subra who then went to the door of the ward to speak to John in Tamil. Subsequently,\n\nZairi said that he re-entered the ward to check on the toilets. He was in the ward when\n\nJohn raised his hand to go to the toilet. Zairi testified that John failed to mention at\n\nthat time whether he wanted to urinate or to ‘pass motion’. Zairi then went into\n\nthe guardroom to inform Subra of the prisoner’s request, upon which the latter\n\noffered to help him bring John to the toilet because John had been rude to him earlier.\n\nZairi said that he had not asked for any assistance and was slightly puzzled by this.\n\nNevertheless he did not feel it necessary at that time to question Subra’s decision.11 Once in the ward, Subra cuffed John’s left hand before\n\nuncuffing the leg-cuffs. He also held onto the other side of the handcuff with his right\n\nhand. John was then led into the toilet by Subra followed by Zairi and Indra. In the\n\ncubicle, John was facing the toilet-bowl with his back to the entrance of the toilet.\n\nThere was no trouble from John and Zairi said he anticipated none at that time. However\n\nwhen Subra wanted to cuff John’s left hand to the railing, John pulled his left hand\n\naway towards his body. An argument in Tamil then started between the two. Zairi said that\n\nit was John who started the quarrel, although he could not be sure if John had scolded\n\nSubra. In the midst of the argument, John raised his free right hand, twisted his waist\n\nand struck a blow at Subra. According to Zairi, Subra managed to block the blow and pushed\n\nJohn’s hand away using his left hand. Throughout the confrontation, Subra continued\n\nto hold onto the other side of the handcuff which was cuffed to John’s left hand. He\n\nthen turned John around and managed to arm-lock the latter’s left hand using the\n\nstraight-arm lock applied from the back with pressure exerted on the wrist and shoulder.\n\nZairi only reacted when he saw that Subra was unable to balance himself well upon\n\napplication of the lock because John was struggling violently and pushing himself forwards\n\nand backwards. According to Zairi, John was using his free right hand to push the wall to\n\nturn and at one point of time, the right hand momentarily left the wall. It was at this\n\nmoment that Zairi came in from the front through the gap between John and the door of the\n\ncubicle to grab hold of John’s right hand. He turned the hand, pulled it behind\n\nJohn’s back and pushed the elbow up to lock the wrist with the words ‘lock\n\non’.12 When John was fully subdued, he was chained to the left railing in\n\nthe toilet and was left there by the guards. Although it would have been more logical for\n\nJohn to be brought back to the bed, so that there was no need to risk facing him again if\n\nhe turned violent, this was not done because Subra as the man-in-charge decided to inform\n\ntheir Adjunct Chua Cheng Wah (‘Mr Chua’) . None of the other officers had the\n\npower to chain both the arms and legs of the prisoner to the bed without obtaining\n\ninstructions from Subra or Mr Chua.",
        "Testimony of the second appellant Indra": "13 Indra said that he was in the guardroom reading newspapers and was\n\nunaware of what had happened between John and Zairi at about 6.20 pm. He heard\n\nconversation between Subra and Zairi outside the guardroom but not what they said. He did\n\nnot see John raise his hand to go to the toilet. He only remembered that Subra had asked\n\nfor his assistance to bring John to the toilet. Subra brought along a pair of handcuffs\n\nand he entered first followed by Zairi. He himself was the last to enter and he closed and\n\nlocked the gates. The key of the ward was left in the guardroom because they were not\n\nallowed to bring it into the ward.14 In the ward, Indra saw Subra handcuff John’s left hand before\n\nreleasing the leg-cuffs. All three of them led the prisoner to the toilet; Subra was\n\nholding on to the left handcuff and walking side-by-side with John. Zairi was behind them\n\nand he in turn was behind Zairi. In the toilet Subra wanted to cuff the other ring of the\n\nhandcuff that he was holding on to the left railing of the toilet. According to Indra,\n\nJohn refused to be so cuffed and a conversation started between them in Tamil that he\n\ncould not comprehend. When Subra attempted to cuff John’s left hand to the railing,\n\nJohn refused and raised his right hand in an attacking manner towards Subra. Subra blocked\n\nthe blow using his left hand. Subra than pulled John’s left hand to apply a straight\n\narm lock. John struggled aggressively, moving to the right and left and causing Subra to\n\nlose his balance. Zairi entered the cubicle and grabbed hold of John’s right hand.\n\nIndra then entered the cubicle and got hold of John’s head. He said that he told John\n\nnot to struggle and then tilted John’s head to the left, facing Subra. Subra and\n\nZairi then applied the ultimate lock on John. John, Subra and Zairi went to a kneeling\n\nposition while Indra told all three of them to turn around slowly. From there, Subra then\n\nhandcuffed John’s left hand to the railing.",
        "The decision below": "15 After a careful evaluation of all the evidence, the magistrate\n\npreferred John’s version of facts to the appellants’ and found that he had been\n\nassaulted in the manner as described to the court. Although the defence had attempted to\n\ncast doubts on the prosecution’s case, by highlighting the apparent discrepancies\n\nbetween the evidence of John and the two prosecution witnesses, Zainali and Lim, the\n\nmagistrate was of the opinion that these discrepancies were not deliberate attempts by the\n\nthree prisoners to lie. He was of the view that Zainali and Lim were witnesses of truth\n\nand the discrepancies were only to be expected, considering that the incident had happened\n\none and a half years ago by the time of the trial and they had no opportunity to discuss\n\ntheir testimonies, as the prisoners were not allowed to talk to each other in ward 34.\n\nNeither could they discuss or tailor their evidence as, before the incident in ward 34,\n\nall three prisoners did not know one another and were subsequently incarcerated in\n\ndifferent penal institutions. Zainali and Lim were also lying on and chained to their beds\n\nwhen they witnessed the incident and heard the sounds coming from the toilet which\n\nhappened within a relatively short period of time. Furthermore, these witnesses had\n\nnothing to gain by making false allegations against the appellants; in fact the converse\n\nwas to be expected.16 The magistrate was of the view that he was entitled, according to\n\nthe case authorities, to accept one part of the evidence of a witness and to reject\n\nanother part. He accepted Lim’s evidence, which was corroborated by the testimonies\n\nof the appellants that Subra, Zairi and Indra first entered the ward. He found that\n\nZainali was mistaken when he testified that Indra came to the ward and left subsequently\n\nand accordingly rejected that part of his evidence. He also found that John made a genuine\n\nmistake when he said that all four accused had entered the ward together and assaulted him\n\nin the toilet. John’s error was attributed to the fact that he was nervous when the\n\nfour SPEAR officers forcibly led him to the toilet when he had not asked to go there and\n\nthat he was still recuperating from a severe asthma attack which left him physically and\n\nmentally weak. Furthermore, John’s evidence that Ali stood at the entrance of the\n\ntoilet and shouted \"don’t see\" was supported by Zainali’s evidence\n\nthat he saw Ali standing at the entrance of the toilet throughout the incident. Hence\n\ntaking into account John’s condition, the fact that he saw Ali standing at the\n\nentrance of the toilet together with the fact that he was being beaten at the time, the\n\ncourt found that it was reasonable for John to assume that he was being assaulted by all\n\nfour officers.17 The magistrate noted that there were certain parts of John’s\n\nevidence that were questionable; for instance, whether there was really an Indian inmate\n\nat bed number 12 to whom he allegedly shouted and John’s admission that he had lied\n\nto his mother as to the number of officers who assaulted him. However, he found that these\n\ndid not detract from the credibility and truthfulness of John’s version of facts as\n\nit was supported in material aspects by the other witnesses. Lim’s evidence that\n\nthere was an argument on 12 January 2000 between John and another officer corroborated\n\nJohn’s assertion that he had quarrelled with Cpl George. Both Zainali and Lim also\n\ntestified that Subra spoke to John whilst the latter was having his dinner. Furthermore,\n\nthe sounds of ‘fighting’ which Zainali and Lim heard whilst John was in the\n\ntoilet with the officers was also consistent with his testimony that he had been assaulted\n\nby the officers. Dr Loh’s report also essentially supported his testimony that he had\n\nbeen punched and kicked.18 Turning to the defence witnesses, the magistrate was of the view\n\nthat all four accused persons were not truthful. He declined to accept the evidence that\n\nJohn had turned violent in the toilet when Subra wanted to cuff his left arm to the\n\nrailing in the toilet. He noted several factors: (1) John was not a person of violent\n\ndisposition (2) Zainali had specifically admitted that they did not anticipate any trouble\n\n(3) None of them had previously had trouble with John during their shifts. Furthermore,\n\nthe magistrate felt that it was illogical for three well-trained SPEAR guards to lock\n\nthemselves in with the prisoners in the ward just to escort one sick prisoner to the\n\ntoilet. In addition he also refused to believe that John, who was still recuperating from\n\nhis asthma attack, was capable of struggling against three fit and strong SPEAR officers\n\nfor some five to six minutes. It was also improbable that the alleged violence was to such\n\nan extent that the officers were not able to administer the mandatory warning prior to the\n\nuse of force. He referred to Mr Chua’s testimony that the warning should only be\n\ndispensed with only in very limited circumstances. That was when there was an urgent need\n\nto subdue the inmate and reduce the level of commotion or if there was life in danger. The\n\nincident in the toilet would not fall within any of those situations. The alleged need to\n\nuse C & R techniques was hence questionable. He drew the inference that the real\n\nreason behind forming the three-man C & R team and entering the ward was to teach John\n\na lesson for ‘talking back’ to Cpl George.19 In particular, the magistrate found that the credit of Ali, the\n\nfirst appellant Zairi and second appellant Indra had been impeached by the prosecution as\n\nthere were material inconsistencies between their oral testimonies in court and previous\n\nstatements made to the police. He rejected Zairi’s explanation that he had informed\n\nthe recording officer, Sergeant Sani, that he wished to make certain amendments to his\n\npolice statement but was instead told by Sergeant Sani to wait for his call which never\n\ncame. On the contrary, it was obvious from the evidence that the first appellant had the\n\nopportunity to make amendments and in fact did so. Therefore any allegation that he had\n\nnot been afforded a reasonable opportunity to correct the material inconsistencies could\n\nonly be an afterthought and a lie. The magistrate also rejected Indra’s explanation\n\nthat he realised that he had made mistakes in both of his police statements after the\n\nsecond statement was recorded and after the trial had started. This was an obvious\n\nindication that Indra’s subsequent testimony in court was tailored.20 The magistrate also placed much weight on the fact that the defence\n\nhad changed its position halfway through the trial. He noted that it had been put to John\n\nduring his cross-examination that only his left hand had been handcuffed to the railing.\n\nThis was inconsistent with the subsequent testimonies of all four accused persons. Each\n\ninsisted that Subra never managed to handcuff John’s left hand at all. The magistrate\n\nfound that the change must have come about upon realisation that it was impossible to\n\nperform C & R in the manner described if John had one hand chained to the railing. He\n\nalso found that it would have been impossible for John to put up such a violent struggle\n\nrequiring C & R if one hand had in fact been handcuffed to the railing.21 In view of the strength of the prosecution’s case and the\n\nmaterial discrepancies in the defence case, the magistrate found that C & R was not in\n\nfact performed on John and John did not turn violent in the cubicle. He was satisfied that\n\nthe prosecution had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt against all four accused\n\npersons and convicted them as charged.",
        "The appeal": "22 The following issues arise for consideration in this appeal:(1) Whether the magistrate should have preferred the prosecution’s\n\n  evidence and witnesses over the defence’s;(2) Whether the magistrate erred in giving undue weight to the\n\n  discrepancies in the evidence and the police statements of the appellants.The appellants were essentially challenging the magistrate’s\n\nfindings of fact by alleging that the testimonies of the prosecution witnesses were\n\ninconsistent while those of the defence witnesses were. Further points were raised upon\n\nargument by the appellants (1) the magistrate erred in his assessment of John as a\n\ncredible witness (2) the magistrate drew inferences adverse to the appellants from the\n\nmedical evidence which was equally capable of construction in their favour and (3) the\n\nmagistrate gave excessive weight to the evidence of Lim and Zainali who did not witness\n\nthe alleged assault in the toilet and whose evidence differed in certain respects from\n\nJohn’s.",
        "First Issue: Should the Magistrate have preferred the prosecution’s version of facts\n\nto that of the defence?": "23 I started off with the premise that the extent of inquiry which can\n\nbe conducted by an appellate court when determining whether a trial judge has erred in his\n\nfindings of fact is closely circumscribed. It is settled law that an appellate court will\n\ndefer to the trial judge’s finding of facts unless they can be shown to be clearly\n\nwrong, reached against the weight of the evidence or that the trial judge has not taken\n\nproper advantage of his having seen and heard the witness:Lim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713,PP v Hla Win[1995] 2 SLR 424,Ng Soo Hin v PP[1994] 1 SLR 105.\n\nThere is a sound rationale for this rule. Unlike the trial judge sitting below, the\n\nappellate court does not have the advantage of observing the demeanour of the witnesses in\n\nthe light of all the relevant evidence of the case. Therefore due weight must be given by\n\nthe appellate court to the findings of facts of the court below.",
        "A Suspicious circumstances not reasonably explained by appellants": "24 From the outset, I had great difficulty in accepting the defence\n\nthat it was John who had suddenly turned violent in the toilet. There were several\n\nsuspicious circumstances in the facts of this case which were not reasonably explained by\n\nthe appellants. They provided the background context with which the evidence should be\n\nviewed as a whole. I shall now highlight these features before going onto an evaluation of\n\nthe defence’s evidence proper.(1) First, the appellants failed to provide any reasonable explanation\n\n  as to why John would have taken issue with being handcuffed to the railings in the toilet\n\n  which Senior Prisons Officer RO2 Chua Cheng Wah (PW6) had testified is standard operating\n\n  procedure. One must bear in mind that Ward 34 in Changi General Hospital is a ward housing\n\n  prisoners. It does not form part of the ‘ordinary’ world where such\n\n  transgressions of privacy and freedom of movement will not be tolerated. There was\n\n  therefore no reason why John would have reacted by trying to punch Subra.(2) John was recuperating from asthma and had been discharged from the\n\n  ICU only two days before the alleged fight on 13 January. It was observed by Lim that\n\n  \"it was not possible (for John to fight) because he was sick then. He was suffering\n\n  from asthma.\" I therefore accepted the magistrate’s reasoning that it was\n\n  difficult to believe that John was capable of turning so violent as to require the\n\n  combined efforts of three SPEAR officers to subdue him. This was especially if one of\n\n  John’s hands had been handcuffed to the railing which was the original position taken\n\n  by the defence.(3) There was a camera in the toilet cubicle, which was linked to CCTV\n\n  and a video. From this CCTV the guards in the guardroom would be able to see what the\n\n  prisoner was doing in the toilet cubicle. The video would also record all movements in the\n\n  toilet. However, on the day when the assault took place, the video was not in operation\n\n  and nothing that happened in the toilet cubicles was recorded. This was recorded by Ali\n\n  and Indra in an entry at 1448 hours of the Hall Journal (exhibit P9) as ‘reported\n\n  video deck out of order in error to Sergeant Jayiadi.’(4) From all accounts John was a difficult and argumentative prisoner.\n\n  This was reflected in the entry at 1921 hours on 12 January 2001 of the Hall Journal\n\n  (exhibit P9) as follows, \"Cpl George came and reported that L 50060/99 was very\n\n  argumentative for every single thing and not carrying out any instructions. Reported to\n\n  Sergeant Chong K.L.\" However even though John was rude and argumentative, he had\n\n  never been physically aggressive or violent, yet the guards saw fit to form a three-man C\n\n  & R team just to escort him to the toilet. One must bear in mind that both appellants\n\n  were seasoned SPEAR guards with at least five years experience who would have encountered\n\n  more violent characters than John.(5) Assuming that John was indeed such a violent character, why did\n\n  both appellants together with Subra not see it fit to comply with the standard procedure\n\n  of first handcuffing both hands of the prisoner before uncuffing his leg cuffs? This is a\n\n  standard precaution that officers will take for all prisoners, not least of all prisoners\n\n  with suspected violent tendencies. On the contrary, John, Lim and Zainali clearly\n\n  testified that Subra actually uncuffed John’s leg cuffsfirstbefore\n\n  handcuffing him. All the accused also admitted that Subraonlyhandcuffed John on\n\n  thelefthand.(6) The magistrate also rightly pointed out that it was suspicious for\n\n  the three guards to effectively ‘lock’ themselves in with the prisoners when\n\n  they left the key in the guardroom without anyone outside to let them out. Was John’s\n\n  request so urgent that they had to attend to him immediately without first informing Ali\n\n  as they alleged? There was also the problem that the nurses and doctors would not be able\n\n  to enter the ward if an emergency arose.",
        "B Did the magistrate err in assessing the credibility of John?": "25 Defence counsel urged this court to hold that the magistrate below\n\nerred in assessing the credibility of John because he had lied to his mother about the\n\nnumber of his assailants.26 I was of the opinion that the magistrate was right in not placing\n\nundue weight on John’s lie to his mother that he was assaulted by only two officers.\n\nThe effect of this inconsistency must be viewed in all the circumstances of the case and\n\nnot be interpreted out of context. A distinction should rightly be drawn between lies made\n\nto police in the course of formal investigations and harmless ‘white lies’ told\n\nso as not to hurt someone else. It is the fact that the witness had made an oath, an\n\naffirmation or a statement representing that what he had said was correct and accurate,\n\nwhich attracts the legal consequences that adverse inferences would be drawn and his\n\ncredibility impugned if he is subsequently proved to have lied in court or to the police\n\nin the course of such investigations. Conversely no such promises are made when statements\n\nare made in the casual and familial context e.g. when a son is confiding to his mother\n\nwhich is the situation in the present case. However it is not every ‘white lie’\n\nthat can be readily excusable, the witness must support it by credible and reasonable\n\nexplanations. The courts will look into the context and the sufficiency of the\n\nexplanations in determining whether or not there was such a lie which adversely affected\n\nthe credibility of the witness. The conduct of the witness is also a relevant factor.27 On the facts, John’s explanation that he had lied because his\n\nmother would have been sad and shocked to hear that four officers had assaulted him and\n\nthat he had cried for help was not so incredible or unreasonable. Furthermore there was\n\nevidence that he had, immediately upon his discharge from the hospital and prior to his\n\nconversation with his mother on 16 February 2000, informed the intelligence unit at Jalan\n\nAwan Prison that he had been assaulted by four SPEAR guards. John had also consistently\n\nadhered to his evidence throughout the trial that all four officers had assaulted him. His\n\nconduct hence added weight to his explanation that he had deliberately lied so as to\n\nprotect his mother. Accordingly, I rejected the appellants’ contention that\n\nJohn’s lie to his mother went ‘to the heart’s of the prosecution\n\ncase’.28 Even accepting the fact that John had lied to his mother as to the\n\nnumber of assailants, I reiterated the point that I had made inLewis Christine v PP[2001] 3 SLR 165that a flawed witness does not equate to an untruthful witness. I agreed\n\nwith the magistrate that it was reasonable for John to assume that he was being assaulted\n\nby all four officers, as he saw Ali standing at the entrance of the toilet while he was\n\nbeing beaten by the other three officers. The magistrate was perfectly entitled for good\n\nand cogent reasons to accept one part of John’s evidence (that he had been assaulted\n\nby SPEAR guards) and reject the other part of his evidence (that he had been assaulted byfourSPEAR guards). There is no rule of law that the testimony of a witness must be believed in\n\nits entirety or not at all:Jiminia Jacee d/o CD Athananasius v PP[2000] 1 SLR 205,Sundara Moorthy Lankatharan v PP[1997] 3 SLR 465 followingPP v Datuk Haji\n\nHarun bin Haji Idris (No 2)[1977] 1 MLJ 15. To quote the words of Thomson C.J. inKhoon\n\nChye Hin v PP[1961] MLJ 105:If a witness demonstrably tells lies on one or two points then it is\n\n  clear that he is not a reliable witness and as a matter of prudence the rest of his\n\n  evidence must be scrutinized with great care and indeed with suspicion. To say, however,\n\n  that because a witness has been proved a liar on one or two points then the whole of his\n\n  evidence ‘must in law be rejected’ is to go too far and is wrong29 The defence also attacked John’s character and urged this court\n\nto find that he had a violent disposition and was an unreliable witness because of his\n\nprevious antecedents (armed robbery with a broken bottle and causing hurt) and poor\n\ndisciplinary record in prison. I was of the view that this argument was unsustainable on\n\nseveral counts. First, it is established law that the fact that a witness has a prior\n\ncriminal record is not per se a basis for treating his evidence as unreliable. There is no\n\nlegal presumption that such a person is unworthy of credit. An analogy can be drawn from\n\nthe law’s treatment of accomplice evidence. InChia Chien Wei Kelvin v PP[1999] 1 SLR 25the Court of Appeal held that, despite s 116 of the Evidence Act, the court has a\n\ndiscretion whether or not to treat accomplice evidence as unreliable. Whether or not the\n\ncourt should believe the evidence of the accomplice must depend on all the circumstances\n\nof the case and his evidence must be tested against the objective facts as well as the\n\ninherent probabilities and improbabilities. This principle is equally applicable here.\n\nSecondly, the Superintendent in charge of Jalan Awan Prison Mr. Abdul Majid Abdul Rahim\n\n(DW5) testified that John did not have a violent disposition as alleged. His file only had\n\nrecords of him being argumentative during counselling. The offences he committed at Jalan\n\nAwan Prison; activating a distress alarm without any reasonable cause, signalling to\n\nanother prisoner and placing his mug in a locker not assigned to him were not violent\n\ncrimes.",
        "C Did the magistrate misread the medical evidence?": "30 I moved on to deal with the appellants’ second submission that\n\nthe magistrate had misread the medical evidence. The most telling aspect of the medical\n\nevidence was thatallof the injuries, except for the mild tenderness at the spine\n\nand both scapulas were sustained by John on theleft side of his body. This was\n\nlargely consistent with John’s account that he was made to bend over the toilet bowl\n\nwith the left side of his body directly facing the entrance of the cubicle where the\n\nappellants were standing and from where the blows were inflicted. Conversely, if the\n\nappellants’ accounts were to be accepted as the truth, there seemed no reason why\n\ninjuries were sustained on the left and not also the right side of John’s body. In\n\nfact, this would be contrary to Subra’s evidence that John’s left hand was\n\nhandcuffed and that he held tightly onto the other ring of the handcuff throughout the\n\nstruggle before locking the arm. If that was indeed the case, it would be difficult for\n\nthe handcuff to knock onto John’s mouth and, even if it did, it would have been\n\nobvious to Subra who was controlling the left handcuff at all material times. However, it\n\nwas clear from the evidence that Subra was unable to testify as to how John sustained the\n\ninjuries. In addition, if a great amount of force was applied by Subra on John’s left\n\nhand (which must have been the case because Subra was able to turn John around simply by\n\npulling on his left handcuff) and John was also struggling violently at the same time,\n\nbruise marks would have appeared on John’s left hand. However none were observed. The\n\nDPP made the pertinent point that the mild tenderness which John sustained on his spine\n\nand shoulder blades was inconsistent with the appellants’ accounts that John had\n\nstruggled very violently, even when C & R technique was applied. If this was true,\n\nJohn would have sustained far more serious injuries to his neck, wrists, shoulders and\n\nelbows than was the case, since the prisoner would be in an awkward and vulnerable\n\nposition once the locks were applied.31 The appellants allege that the loss of John’s tooth could have\n\nbeen due to a fall on the floor or when he came into contact with any sharp edge of the\n\nhandcuff. However, both appellants did not testify that John had fallen onto the ground or\n\nhad been hit by the handcuffs. They were also unable to provide a reasonable explanation\n\nas to how the injuries were caused even though both of them were together with John within\n\nthe narrow confines of the toilet cubicle. Indra as the headman who controlled John’s\n\nhead testified that John’s head never hit anything when he was holding onto it, he\n\ndid not see John’s face hit the door-frame or the handcuff hit his mouth, yet he\n\nsubsequently suggested that John might have sustained the injuries during the struggle.\n\nThis was altogether unsatisfactory.",
        "D Did the magistrate place excessive reliance upon the evidence of Lim and Zainali?": "32 There were several discrepancies between the evidence of Lim,\n\nZainali and John as set out above. These were :(1) Lim testified that Zairi and Indra rushed towards Johnafterhe was handcuffed by Subra whereas John said that all four staff came to his bedbeforeSubra uncuffed his legs and applied his handcuff.(2) Lim testified that Subra, Zairi and Indra pulled John to the toilet\n\n  and were hitting his head throughout. Neither John nor Zainali testified to this.(3) Zainali testified that Subra and Zairi entered the toilet with John\n\n  while Ali waited at the entrance and Indra only entered the ward to take a look before\n\n  leaving the ward. Conversely Lim said that it was Subra, Zairi and Indra that pulled John\n\n  into the toilet and Ali remained in the guardroom.(4) Lim also stated that Subra and Zairi left the toilet clearing blood\n\n  off their hands first. They were then followed by Indra a short while later. Conversely\n\n  John’s story was that all four guards left at the same time while Zainali said that\n\n  Subra, Zainali and Ali left the ward together.33 It is settled law that the credibility of a witness cannot be\n\nimpeached unless there are serious discrepancies or material contradictions between his\n\noral testimony and his previous police statements:Muthusamy v PP[1948] MLJ 57.\n\n‘Material’ inconsistencies are those inconsistencies that go to the crux of the\n\ncharges against the appellants:Kwang Boon Keong Peter v PP[1998] 2 SLR 592. In\n\ndetermining whether the credit of the accused or a witness has been impeached, the court\n\nwill compare the oral evidence with the previous statement to assess the overall\n\nimpression which has been created as a whole: PP v Heah Lian Khin[2000] 3 SLR 611.34 I considered that the discrepancies in (1), (2) and (4) were not\n\nmaterial as they had no direct bearing on the facts in issue i.e. nothing to do with the\n\nquestion whether the appellants assaulted John in the toilet. They merely related to the\n\nsequence of events before and after the assault in the toilet and did not detract from the\n\ngeneral veracity of Lim and Zainali on the material issues:Ng Kwee Leong v PP[1998] 3 SLR 942. Therefore they could not aid the appellants here. The inconsistencies in\n\n(3) as to theidentitiesof the guards who entered the toilet with John were more\n\nfundamental. Zainali said that the three assailants were Subra, Zairi and Ali whereas Lim\n\nsaid that they were Subra, Zairi and Indra. On the other hand, there were explicit\n\nadmissions from both appellants that they accompanied Subra in escorting John to the\n\ntoilet. Hence neither was this aspect of Lim’s and Zainali’s evidence\n\nobjectionable. The magistrate was convinced that Lim and Zainali were truthful, as their\n\ntestimonies in court, even when tested under cross-examination, remained clear and\n\nconsistent. He also rightly identified the various factors that contributed to the\n\ndiscrepancies in testimonies. It would be helpful to recall the words of Abdul Hamid J. inChean Siong Guat v PP[1969] 2 MLJ 63at p. 63-64 as accepted by this court inSundara\n\nMoorthy Lankartharan v PPsupra.Discrepancies may, in my view, be found in any case for the simple\n\n  reason that no two persons can describe the same thing in exactly the same way. Sometimes\n\n  what appears to be discrepancies are in reality different ways of describing the same\n\n  thing, or it may happen that the witnesses who are describing the same thing might have\n\n  seen it in different ways and at different times and that is how discrepancies are likely\n\n  to arise. These discrepancies may either be minor or serious discrepancies.Absolute\n\n  truth is, I think beyond human perception and conflicting versions of an incident, even by\n\n  honest and disinterested witnesses, is a common occurrence. In weighing the testimony of\n\n  witnesses, human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection are often\n\n  recognised by the court. Being a question of fact, what a magistrate needs to do is to\n\n  consider the discrepancies and say whether they are minor or serious discrepancies…On\n\n  the other hand, if a magistrate finds the discrepancies do not detract from the value of\n\n  the testimony of the witness or witnesses, it would be proper for him to regard the\n\n  discrepancies as trivial and ignore them. (emphasis added)35 I was also of the view that it was incorrect for the appellants to\n\nassert that the sounds heard by Lim and Zainali were sounds of John struggling violently\n\nin the toilet and their efforts to subdue him. Lim and Zainali clearly testified that they\n\nheard ‘sounds of fighting’, ‘thumping sounds’ and the sound of ‘a\n\nbody hitting against the wall’. I note from the evidence that the appellants had\n\ntestified that no blows were ever exchanged between John and Subra as Subra had managed to\n\nward off the blow allegedly delivered by John with his right hand before locking\n\nJohn’s left hand. If the sequence of events as testified by the appellants was to be\n\naccepted by this court, there would have been no opportunity at all for John to punch\n\nanyone. Furthermore, if the C & R technique was truly applied upon John, there would\n\nnot have been such sounds. Assistant Superintendent 1 Mark Jason Jevanathan (PW8) had\n\ntestified that C & R had never failed in his years of service and he failed to\n\nunderstand why it should have failed in John’s case. Essentially the three-man C\n\n& R team consisting of the ‘head man’ would hold onto the head of the\n\nprisoner and tilt it to one side, the right-hand man would grab the right hand around the\n\nwrist and bend the prisoner forward and similarly for the left-hand man. Once the locks\n\nwere in place, the prisoner would be effectively subdued and immobilised. I was satisfied\n\nthat the trial judge did not err in accepting the testimony of Lim and Zainali nor did he\n\nplace undue reliance upon it.",
        "Second Issue: Did the court give undue weight to the discrepancies between the evidence of\n\nthe appellant in court and previous s121 statements?": "36The credit of the appellants was impeached at trial. Now on\n\nappeal, they argued that the inconsistencies between the police statements and their oral\n\ntestimony were immaterial and were due to human fallibility in recollection. I shall not\n\nreiterate the legal principles dealing with this area of the law and will now consider the\n\ninconsistencies in the evidence of each appellant in turn.37 The inconsistencies between Zairi’s police statements and\n\ntestimony in court were as follows:(1) In his police statement, Zairi said that John had wanted to pass\n\n  motion. However in court he said that John did not mention whether he wanted to urinate or\n\n  otherwise.(2) In his police statement, Zairi stated that he had asked Subra for\n\n  help in escorting John to the toilet. However under cross-examination Zairi first\n\n  testified that Subra had offered him help and he did not ask Subra for help before\n\n  changing his mind to state that it was Subra who asked him for help.(3) In his police statement, Zairi said that he heard John scold Subra\n\n  \"Pundek\" which he knew was a ‘vulgar word in Tamil’. In court, he\n\n  denied ever hearing this and testified that he could not understand whatever John and\n\n  Subra were saying.(4) In his police statement, Zairi said that he came to catch hold of\n\n  John’s right hand and applied a straight-arm lock when he saw Subra trying to defend\n\n  himself from John’s punch. In court, Zairi testified that he only came in to lock\n\n  John’s right hand using a hammer-lockafterSubra had warded off the blowandhe saw Subra losing his balance after turning John around because the latter was\n\n  pushing the wall to turn against Subra.(emphasis added)38 The inconsistencies between Indra’s police statements and his\n\ntestimony in court were:(1) In his police statement, Indra said that he was inside the\n\n  guardroom looking through the glass panel into the ward and that he could see Zairi having\n\n  problems with John. Conversely, in his testimony in court, Indra said that he was reading\n\n  the newspapers and was unaware that any trouble had happened between John and Zairi from\n\n  6.20 p.m. till the time he helped escort John to the toilet. He only heard conversation\n\n  between Zairi and Subra outside the guardroom(2) In his police statement Indra said that, at about 6.38 p.m., he saw\n\n  John put up his hand to go to the toilet and he felt that he should help Zairi after\n\n  seeing the trouble between them earlier. Conversely, in his oral testimony he said that he\n\n  never saw John putting his hand up and that he only went along because Subra asked him for\n\n  help.39 With respect to the first discrepancy between Zairi’s testimony\n\nin court and his police statements, I shared the view of the magistrate below that it was\n\nmaterial because it directly affected the evidence of both appellants. It would have made\n\nit impossible for the entire sequence of events to happen as alleged by the appellants to\n\nhave taken place, if John was facing outwards rather than inwards (if he had wanted to use\n\nthe toilet). Subra could not have attempted to handcuff his left hand to the toilet\n\nrailing but rather his right hand. The second discrepancy was also material because it\n\nrelated to events just prior to the commission of the offence charged. Zairi’s\n\nvacillation also impugned upon the bona fides of motives; whether or not assistance to\n\nescort John to the toilet was really necessary in the first place. His credit was not\n\nsaved by his subsequent explanation that the third version was the correct statement of\n\nevents because he was able to remember the events more clearly ‘when the trial took\n\nplace and from the evidence produced’.40 With respect to the fourth point, there was a discrepancy as to the\n\ntiming when Zairi came to help and an omission of the sequence of events which led to\n\nSubra losing his balance. In court, Zairi testified that heonlyreacted when he\n\nsaw that Subra was unable to control John, but there was no mention of this at all in his\n\npolice statements. I adopted the position I took inPP v Heah Lian Khinsupra.that an omission will amount to an inconsistency when it would have been natural for the\n\nperson to make the assertion in question. I was of the opinion that it would only be\n\nnatural for Zairi to have mentioned that Subra was unable to control John in his police\n\nstatement because he had couched it as the reason for entering the ‘fray’ in his\n\noral testimony. This was an essential and crucial aspect of his defence, which clearly\n\ncalled for an explanation and, when none was given, the omission thereof would be capable\n\nof being construed as a material inconsistency. Therefore I had no doubt that the numerous\n\ndiscrepancies taken cumulatively impugned upon the general veracity and credibility of the\n\nfirst appellant.41 Similarly, the discrepancies in Indra’s testimony were material\n\nbecause they affected his intention and reasons for escorting John. It was also evident\n\nthat Indra was trying to minimize his involvement in the entire affair and to fit his\n\nevidence to that of Subra and Zairi. This much he had admitted to in court when he\n\ntestified that he only realised the mistakes in his statement and started recalling the\n\nevents properly only during the trial when he heard the evidence of the other accused\n\npersons.42 A successful impeachment of a witness’s credit goes only to the\n\nweight of his oral testimony in court and not its admissibility. It does not mean that all\n\nhis oral testimony will be expunged. This point was elucidated by Chao Hick Tin JC (as he\n\nthen was) inPP v Somwang Phattanasaeng[1992] 1 SLR 138at p.148Having regard to these material discrepancies, we found that the\n\n  prosecution had successfully impeached the credit of the accused. We would, however, say\n\n  that the fact that the credit of an accused person or a witness has been impeached does\n\n  not necessarily mean that all his evidence must be disregarded. The court must carefully\n\n  scrutinize the whole of the evidence to determine which aspect might be true and which\n\n  aspect should be disregarded.The position was subsequently reinforced byYeo Choon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217,PP v Mohammed Faizal Shah[1998] 1 SLR 333andKwang Boon\n\nKeong Peter v PPsupra.43 With this in mind, I turned to consider the impact which the\n\nimpeachment exercises had upon the evidence of Zairi and Indra. At this juncture, some\n\nconsideration must be given to the case ofPP v Mohammed Faizal Shahwhich was\n\ncited to me by counsel during the appeal. The accused in that case faced three charges of\n\nemploying three foreign workers without a valid employment pass to one Palms Shuttle Caf\n\n(PSC). He allegedly brought the three workers to a line-up from which they were picked to\n\nwork by one Charlie Lim who was the operations manager of the caf. He maintained\n\nthroughout the trial that the three workers were supplied by one Robin and not by him.\n\nThis was supported by one Cheong. Conversely, the prosecution’s case was weak. The\n\nevidence of the main prosecution witness, Charlie, was bedevilled with inconsistencies; he\n\nwas unsure if the workers were supplied by the respondent or Robin and the date of\n\ncommencement of work of these workers. Although all three workers identified the\n\nrespondent as their employer, one Delower denied being part of any line-up and Jeevan\n\ntestified that Delower and Sahajahan had already started work before him, therefore\n\ncasting doubt on Sahajahan’s testimony that he was present at the line-up. Delower\n\nwas also inconsistent as to when he received wages from the respondent.44 The district judge held that the many discrepancies in the\n\ntestimonies of the prosecution’s witnesses made it unsafe to conclude that they were\n\nemployed at the line-up. A reasonable doubt was also raised as to whether the respondent\n\nwas correctly identified as the employer of the three workers because Charlie was\n\nobviously unsure. Although the credit of the accused had been impeached, its effect was\n\nminimal, as the court could not convict on the bare assertions of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses. Other than the inconsistencies in the respondent’s evidence, the\n\nprosecution had also failed to adduce other evidence to show that the evidence of the\n\naccused was unreliable. The district judge acquitted the accused of all three charges.\n\nThis was reaffirmed by me sitting in the High Court upon appeal.45 With respect, the present case was clearly distinguishable fromMohammed\n\nFaizal Shah. We were not dealing with a case where the prosecution was pulling itself\n\nup by the bootstraps of the defence. John’s evidence was bolstered by objective\n\nmedical evidence and corroborated by the independent evidence of Lim and Zainali who had\n\nno reason to lie. Conversely, the appellants’ evidence was only supported by the\n\nevidence of their co-accomplices, which were found by the magistrate to be unreliable. As\n\nevaluated above, numerous suspicious circumstances of the appellants’ case were not\n\nsatisfactorily explained and neither was their version of facts consistent with the\n\ninjuries suffered by John. The impeachment of the appellants’ credit dealt another\n\nfatal blow to their case. Therefore I had no doubt that the trial judge was correct in\n\nholding that the prosecution had established their case beyond a reasonable doubt and\n\nconvicting the appellants.",
        "The appropriate sentence": "46 The appellants were also appealing against the trial judge’s\n\nsentence of nine months. I noted that the sentence that can be imposed by the court under\n\ns323 of the Penal Code (Cap 224) is imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year\n\nor with fine which may extend to $1,000 or both. This was the first case I had tried\n\ninvolving SPEAR officers who had acted contrary to their public duty by setting upon a\n\ndefenceless prisoner to teach him a lesson. They are persons empowered to place prisoners\n\nunder confinement and who are expected to abide by the law, but yet they had chosen to\n\ntake matters into their own hands. Although both of the appellants had impeccable service\n\nrecords and no prior antecedents, these factors could but have minimal mitigating effect\n\nin cases, like the present, when public interest was affected.47 I was of the view that a clear message had to be sent to all, that\n\nprison brutality cases will not be condoned and will be met with harsh penalties\n\nespecially when committed in the course of duty. How else could the prison officers\n\nfulfill their much publicized mission of being the ‘captain of lives’ in the\n\nrehabilitation and reformation of prisoners? Inmates incarcerated within prisons for long\n\nperiods of time have a right to know that they will not be abused. Similarly their\n\nrelatives and the public at large also need to be assured that prison officers will not\n\nabuse their positions of trust vis--vis the prisoners and the public. Furthermore the\n\nappellants in this case had obviously exploited their positions of power shamelessly when\n\nthey ‘ganged up’ to inflict blows mercilessly on a sick and powerless prisoner\n\nin the toilet of a prison ward. They had also connived to ‘cover up’ their act\n\nby putting false entries in the Hall Journal and calling their superiors immediately\n\nthereafter to lend credence to their story that John suddenly became violent and attacked\n\nthem. The fact that the video recorder was not working on that particular day of the\n\nassault could not be mere coincidence. All these pointed towards careful planning and\n\ndevious minds. Therefore, taking into account all the aggravating factors of this case, I\n\nwas not persuaded that the sentence of nine months imprisonment was so manifestly\n\nexcessive as to justify its overturn.",
