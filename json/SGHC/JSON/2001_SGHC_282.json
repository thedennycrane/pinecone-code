        "Defendants application": "20 The defendants application to court is based on para 9 of the First\n\nSchedule to the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322) which reads:Stay of proceedings9. Power to dismiss or stay proceedings where the matter in question is res\n\n  judicata between the parties, or where by reason of multiplicity of proceedings in any court or\n\n  courts or by reason of a court in Singapore not being the appropriate forum the proceedings ought\n\n  not to be continued.21 The submission by the defendant that given the entire spectrum, background and\n\ncharacter of the dealings between the contestants, Singapore is not the appropriate forum to\n\nlitigate the dispute at hand. This argument was accepted as valid by the learned assistant\n\nregistrar. In the appeal before me, counsel for the plaintiff endeavoured to persuade me that on the\n\nbasis of the evidence placed before the court by the plaintiff, Singapore is the natural and the\n\nmost appropriate forum for the present action to be tried. A synopsis of his arguments is as\n\nfollows:(a)Witnesses:The main witnesses for the present proceedings are the\n\n  plaintiff, the defendant, Salleh and Praptono (the first three being Malaysian residents and the\n\n  last being an Indonesian resident). Other witnesses are reluctant to testify in Malaysia but are\n\n  willing to testify in Singapore (para 41 of appellants submission).(b)Events:The major events pertaining to the plaintiffs claim did\n\n  not occur only in Malaysia but in Singapore as well. Main bulk of the plaintiffs claim against\n\n  the defendant is for the sum of US$5,000,000 which the defendant agreed to pay to the plaintiff\n\n  during a car ride between Seletar airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi in Johor (paras 43 and 44 of the\n\n  submission).(c)Governing law of the loan agreements:Several of the drafts of the\n\n  Master Agreements stipulated that the law of England to be the governing law for the same. The\n\n  arbitration clauses too provided for the UNICTRAL Rules in Singapore to apply (paras 45 and 46 of\n\n  the submission).(d)Assets of parties: The defendant has not provided any details to support\n\n  his contention that he has substantial assets in Malaysia. On the contrary, the plaintiff has\n\n  evidence that the defendants have substantial assets in Singapore (para 49 of the submission).(e)Excessive delay in Malaysia:There is a huge backlog of cases in the\n\n  Malaysian Courts and there is likely to be an inordinate delay in the prosecution of the plaintiffs\n\n  claim (para 59 of the submission).(f)The defendants privileged position in Malaysia:The defendant is\n\n  the Crown Prince of Johor. He may ascend the Johor Throne before the conclusion of the trial and\n\n  in the result he will be granted immunity against any proceedings in Malaysia (para 62 of the\n\n  submission).22 When asked to state where the agreement relating to the subject matter of the\n\nclaim was concluded, plaintiffs counsel invited the courts attention to para 346 of the\n\nstatement of claim which states that the promise by the defendant to pay the plaintiff the sum under\n\nreference was made during a car ride from the Singapore Seletar Airport to Istana Pasir Pelangi,\n\nJohor. Plaintiffs counsel also confirmed that the plaintiffs various claims in the statement\n\nof claim are founded on oral agreements and variations of the said oral agreements between the\n\nplaintiff and the defendant. Interestingly, counsel for the plaintiff conceded that there is in\n\nexistence a draft agreement (exh TMJ-7 in the affidavit of the defendant filed on 23 April 2000)\n\nprepared in relation to this matter by him, which is signed by the plaintiff but not by the\n\ndefendant. I shall revert to this draft later in these grounds.23 Counsel for the defendant in his submission underscored the aspect that both\n\nthe contestants featured in this case are Malaysian residents and the other principal figure\n\nPraptono is an Indonesian. The draft agreement in relation to the subject matter prepared by\n\nplaintiffs counsel, signed by the plaintiff and forwarded to the defendant for execution but not\n\nsigned by him, clearly stipulates that the governing law of the agreement between the parties is\n\nMalaysia and the parties shall submit to the jurisdiction of the courts in Malaysia (see cl 10 of\n\nthe draft contract in the exh TMJ-7 referred to). To dispel any doubt as to the course to be adopted\n\nby the defendant, his counsel also reaffirmed his clients intention that he would submit to the\n\njurisdiction of the courts in Malaysia. Counsel further invited the attention of the court to a\n\nsignificant feature that the four loan agreements which form the backdrop to the plaintiffs claim\n\nand alleged agreement for services in relation to them concern matters outside Singapore. After\n\nfurther highlighting the fact that Praptono has also filed a claim against the defendant in Malaysia\n\nas respects Pratponos purported claims against the defendant, he urged the court to rule that\n\nSingapore is decidedly not the most appropriate forum to try the dispute between that parties and\n\nsuggested Malaysia as being the most appropriate forum, if not Indonesia.",
        "Decision": "24 It would appear from the arguments presented before me that the plaintiffs\n\nprincipal reason for choosing to proceed against the defendant in Singapore and not Malaysia is due\n\nto his apprehension that the defendant may have an overwhelming advantage over him in Malaysia by\n\nvirtue of his princely status. The other reason pressed before me was that the courts in Malaysia\n\nare unable to dispose of the cases expeditiously as there is a substantial backlog of cases there.\n\nThe question that needs to be answered here is whether the foregoing grievances justify this court\n\nin holding Singapore as the most appropriate forum. The principles of law applicable in this regard\n\nare set out by the House of Lords in England inSpiliada Maritime Corp v Cansulex Ltd, The\n\nSpiliada[1986] 3 All ER 843.25 InThe Spiliadathe House of Lords was primarily concerned with\n\nissues relating to the granting of leave under O 11 r 1(1) of the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1970\n\nto serve proceedings out of the jurisdiction. All the same, the Law Lords held in that case that the\n\nprinciples governing the granting of such leave were the same as those applicable to a stay of\n\nEnglish proceedings. Lord Goff of Chievely who delivered the main speech, restated the law on this\n\nmatter which is succinctly encapsulated in the third cumulative supplement toDicey &\n\nMorris on Conflict of Laws(11thEd) at paras 393-395 as follows:"
