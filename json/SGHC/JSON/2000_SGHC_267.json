        "THE PROSECUTION’S SUBMISSIONS ON SENTENCE": "11 After noting that the Accused’s only criminal record consisted\n\nof a traffic offence in 1988, the Prosecution asked that a deterrent sentence be imposed\n\non the Accused based on the guidelines enunciated by the Court of Appeal inLim Hock\n\nHin Kelvin v PP[1998] 1 SLR 801. The Prosecution submitted that the Accused had\n\nabused the trust reposed in him by the boys who regarded him as an elder brother or uncle.\n\nIt was also said that \"such an introduction to sexuality by this self-professed\n\nhomosexual could result in some form of sexual confusion in the victims\" and that\n\n\"these acts of sexual deviancy have a very corrupting effect especially on\n\nadolescents such as the eight victims in the present instance\". The Prosecution also\n\nsubmitted that there should be no distinction in principle between anal sex and oral sex\n\nwhere Section 377 of the Penal Code was concerned.THE MITIGATION PLEA12 In his handwritten Mitigation Plea, the Accused claimed that\n\n\"it was a voluntary act by which both parties were interested in the act.\"\n\nMoreover, he added, he \"was being seduced\" and his mind \"was unstable\n\nduring the incident\". He explained that he was not suggesting that the boys had asked\n\nhim to perform oral sex on them but merely that some of them had disturbed him and talked\n\nabout oral sex. He was sexually stimulated but the stimulation was not by the boys.13 The Accused also said that he did not use any force, that the boys\n\nwere willing parties and they knew that he was a homosexual. He claimed that his\n\n\"male genetic hormones have been reduced through the years\".14 Although he wrote that the 23 Charges were \"considerably\n\nunfair\" and he had \"pleaded guilty in station due to heavy stress and thorough\n\ninterrogation\", he confirmed in Court that he was willingly confessing to the\n\noffences. He was very remorseful and regretted what he had done \"though it was not my\n\nintention\". He felt sorry for the victims. He also felt ashamed and very guilty and\n\nbegged for leniency.15 The Accused is single. His father passed away recently. His mother\n\nwas in Johor and was very ill.DECISION OF THE COURT16 The punishment provided under Section 377 of the Penal Code is\n\nimprisonment for life or imprisonment for up to 10 years and a discretionary fine.17 Since the Court of Appeal’s decision inPP v Kwan Kwong Weng[1997] I SLR 697, it is clear that fellatio between two male persons is unnatural carnal\n\nintercourse within the meaning of Section 377 of the Penal Code. Consent is irrelevant\n\nalthough threats or the use of violence would aggravate the offence.18 The Court of Appeal inLim Hock Hin Kelvin v PP[1998] 1 SLR 801laid down the following sentencing guidelines in respect of paedophiles:\"24 Bearing in mind the gravity of the offence, we started from\n\n  the position that a paedophile who commits unnatural carnal intercourse (in the form of\n\n  anal intercourse) against young children below the age of 14 years, without any\n\n  aggravating or mitigating factors, should be sentenced to ten years’ imprisonment.\n\n  There should not be any difference whether the victim is a young girl or a young boy. The\n\n  court would then have to consider the aggravating and mitigating factors in increasing or\n\n  reducing the sentence.\"19 Where chronic paedophiles are concerned, the Court of Appeal said:\"35 … In future, chronic paedophiles (such as the appellant)\n\n  who are shown to be unable or unwilling to control themselves and who target children as\n\n  victims should be sentenced to life imprisonment …\"20 In the present case, the offences occurred over a period of some 12\n\nmonths. The Accused here has no previous convictions save for a traffic offence. I do not\n\nthink therefore that he necessarily falls within the meaning of \"chronic\n\npaedophile\" contemplated by the Court of Appeal inKelvin Limand life\n\nimprisonment is probably not appropriate here.21 Last month, I dealt with the case ofPP v Tan Ah Kit(CC No.\n\n67 of 2000), where two Charges of anal intercourse and one Charge of fellatio involving\n\ntwo boys were proceeded with. Six other Charges were taken into consideration there, one\n\nof which involved anal intercourse and three involved fellatio.22 InPP v Tan Ah Kit, I made the following remarks:\"23 The Court of Appeal’s sentencing guidelines (at paragraph\n\n  24 of the judgment) apply to paedophiles performing anal intercourse on young children\n\n  below 14 years of age. The guidelines apply squarely to the first victim, MF, who was 11\n\n  and 12 years old at the material times. Where the second victim S was concerned, he was\n\n  almost 15 years old at the time of the offences but did not appear to have been materially\n\n  more mature or intelligent than MF was. Moreover, the unnatural carnal intercourse\n\n  involved in the two Charges concerning S was fellatio and not anal intercourse. InKelvin\n\n  Lim, the acts of fellatio were made the subject of Charges under Section 377A and not\n\n  Section 377 of the Penal Code. Section 377A carries a maximum imprisonment term of only\n\n  two years and Kelvin Lim received one year imprisonment for each of the five Charges under\n\n  Section 377A. Whether fellatio is made the subject of a Charge under Section 377 or 377A\n\n  of the Penal Code is a matter of prosecutorial discretion. … In my view, fellatio and\n\n  anal intercourse involving two males are not really distinguishable when they are the\n\n  subject of Charges preferred under Section 377. Everything said about anal intercourse\n\n  applies to oral intercourse except for the potential physical injury caused by penetration\n\n  of the victim’s anus. Further, I do not think any distinction ought to be made on the\n\n  basis of who is penetrating whom. I am therefore of the opinion that the guidelines set by\n\n  the Court of Appeal should apply to the case of S in the same way as they patently do in\n\n  the case of MF.\"23 In this case, in the eight Charges proceeded with, eight boys were\n\ninvolved. All had fellatio performed on them. They ranged in age between 12 plus and 14\n\nplus at the time of the offences stated in the said eight Charges. Those who were past 14\n\nyears of age did not appear to be materially more mature or intelligent than those who\n\nwere below 14 years of age.24 LikeTan Ah Kit, the Accused here knew \"where to fish\n\nand what would make the fishes bite\". Here, it was the video game equipment that he\n\nused to entice the boys to his lair. He obviously had a paedophilic predator’s mind\n\nand ability to target the potential victims. While violence or threats would aggravate the\n\noffences, the seeming consent or acquiescence of the young vulnerable victims did not make\n\nthe offences any less abhorrent. The law must punish severely those who have attained\n\nmaturity but take advantage of the youthful innocence of those who can be easily led\n\nastray by gifts, games or money.25 I see no significant mitigating factors here save for the\n\nAccused’s plea of guilt. I therefore sentence the Accused to 10 years imprisonment in\n\nrespect of each of the eight Charges to which he has pleaded guilty. In view of the\n\nabhorrent nature of the offences, the number of boys and the total number of offences\n\ninvolved, society should be protected from him for a long time. I am therefore ordering\n\nthe imprisonment sentences for the 8th, 12th, 14thand 23rdCharges to run consecutively with effect from 22 June 2000. The other four imprisonment\n\nsentences will run concurrently with these four, making a total of 40 years imprisonment\n\nwith effect from 22 June 2000.Tay Yong KwangJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
