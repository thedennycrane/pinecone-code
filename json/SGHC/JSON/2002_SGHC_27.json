        "The law on amendment of charges": "5 Section 268 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides that the High\n\nCourt may, in an application for criminal revision, exercise, inter alia, its powers under\n\ns 256 of the Criminal Procedure Code. Section 256 in turn grants to the High Court wide\n\npowers in the exercise of its appellant jurisdiction. That such powers include the power\n\nto amend a charge and consequently convict an accused person on the amended charge was\n\nconclusively established by the Court of Appeal inGarmaz s/o Pakhar & Anor v\n\nPublic Prosecutor[1996] 1 SLR 401. This power has since been exercised on several\n\noccasions, most recently in cases such asLoo Weng Fatt v Public Prosecutor[2001] 3 SLR 313andEr Joo Nguang & Anor v Public Prosecutor[2000] 2 SLR 645.6 The exercise of the power to amend is, however, subject to certain\n\nrestrictions. InGarmaz s/o Pakhar, the Court ofAppeal noted:The requirement of ss 166 and 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code must\n\n  be satisfied before a High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction alters or\n\n  substitutes a conviction for a different offence. Although therefore an appellate court is\n\n  possessed of the power which it can lawfully exercise, it is equally essential that such\n\n  power be exercised within the confines of the law. The question is to what extent and\n\n  under what circumstances such power can be invoked. What is clear in our minds is, and we\n\n  emphasise, that such power must be exercised under limited circumstances and with great\n\n  caution subject to the restriction imposed by s 167 of the Criminal Procedure Code, and it\n\n  must be done so as not to prejudice the case of an accused.InPublic Prosecutor v Koon Seng Construction Pte Ltd[1996] 1 SLR 573, I stated, in the context of an amendment to a charge on which the accused had\n\npleaded guilty:The power of amendment is clearly not unfettered. It\n\n  should be exercised sparingly, subject to careful observance of the safeguards against\n\n  prejudice to the defence […] The court must be satisfied that the proceedings below\n\n  would have taken the same course, and the evidence recorded would have been the same. The\n\n  primary consideration is that the amendment will not cause any injustice, or affect the\n\n  presentation of the evidence, in particular, the accused’s defence. These safeguards\n\n  must be rigorously observed.",
        "Application to the present case": "7 InAng Poh Chuan v Public Prosecutor[1996] 1 SLR 326, I laid\n\nout certain guidelines relating to the exercise of the High Court’s revisionary\n\njurisdiction, viz:[…] various phrases may be used to identify the circumstances\n\n  which would attract the exercise of the revisionary jurisdiction, but they all share the\n\n  common denominator that there must be some serious injustice. Of course there cannot be a\n\n  precise definition of what would constitute such serious injustice for that would in any\n\n  event unduly circumscribe what must be a wide discretion vested in the court, the exercise\n\n  of which would depend largely on the particular facts. But generally it must be shown that\n\n  there is something palpably wrong in the decision that strikes at its basis as an exercise\n\n  of judicial power by the court below.The present situation was clearly a proper case for the exercise of the\n\nrevisionary power, in that the appellant had been convicted and sentenced for non-existent\n\noffences. However, I also had to consider whether the proper course for me to take was to\n\namend the charges as requested by the Public Prosecutor, and thereafter convict the\n\nappellant on them. I was mindful that the cases in which the High Court exercised its\n\npower to amend charges largely related to situations where the charge was defective in\n\nthat it did not disclose the commission of an offence, eg inOng Tiong Poh v Public\n\nProsecutor[1998] 2 SLR 853, or where a new offence, made out on the facts, was\n\nsubstituted for an offence which was not made out on the facts, as inLoo Weng Fatt.\n\nThe situation before me, on the other hand, concerned the appellant pleading guilty to\n\nnon-existent offences, and it was necessary to determine whether the High Court’s\n\npowers of amendment extended to such situations.8 InKoon Seng Construction, I approved the exercise of the\n\npower of amendment in a situation where the accused person, due to a clerical error,\n\npleaded guilty to an offence different from that which both prosecution and defence had\n\nintended to proceed under. In making my decision, I took the view that such situations\n\nwere analogous to those where the High Court substitutes the charge and convicts the\n\naccused on the substituted charge. As I noted then:Substituting a charge necessarily involves amending the\n\n  charge to introduce different terms. Whether the amendment introduces an entirely\n\n  different offence section or not, a new and different charge is in place. The necessity to\n\n  observe the safeguards against prejudice operates to ensure that the substituted charge\n\n  does not stray beyond the limits imposed by ss 173 to 175 CPC. In other words, an\n\n  amendment to introduce a substituted charge should be no different in effect from a\n\n  substituted conviction.9 Following from the above, I had no hesitation in deciding that the\n\npower of amendment extended to the present situation. In any event, it was patently clear\n\nto me that the defects in the charges in question arose from a failure to conform the\n\nwording in the charges to the wording of the statute. As such, apart from viewing this\n\nparticular application to amend the charge as analogous to a substituted conviction, I was\n\nalso of the view that it was analogous to those situations where the charge failed to\n\ndisclose the necessary elements of the offence. Finally, I took note of the decision in\n\nthe Malaysian case ofSiah Ik Kow v Public Prosecutor[1968] 2 MLJ 217, in which\n\nthe court amended the original charge, which referred to a non-existent offence, and\n\nsubstituted the correct offence.10 Having decided that the present case was a proper one for the\n\nexercise of the power of amendment, I considered whether the exercise would cause the\n\nappellant any injustice. I concluded that it would not. Apart from the fact that the\n\nappellant, when given the opportunity to object to the proposed amendments, stated that he\n\nhad no such objections, I was also satisfied that the course of the proceedings in the\n\ncourt below would not have taken a different turn had the charges been correctly drawn up\n\nin the first place. The two offences to which the charges related were clearly made out on\n\nthe facts, the appellant having been caught red-handed. They were also complete offences,\n\nsuch that there had been no need to charge the appellant with attempt in the first place.\n\nFurthermore, I was mindful that the appellant had also pleaded guilty to a second,\n\ncorrectly worded charge, relating to a separate incident, which had also been brought\n\nunder s 29(3) of the Films Act.11 Finally, I was satisfied that the appellant would not be prejudiced\n\nin terms of his sentence if I granted the application. The appellant had been sentenced to\n\nterms of imprisonment ranging from one month’s to six months’ imprisonment for\n\nthe four Films Act offences and the one related charge brought under the Penal Code of\n\nexhibiting obscene VCD covers. These sentences were ordered to run concurrently, such that\n\nthe appellant only faced six months’ imprisonment for all five offences. Of the two\n\ndefective charges, the appellant was sentenced on the one brought under s 6(1)(a) of the\n\nFilms Act to three months’ imprisonment, such that the punishment for that offence\n\nwould have been subsumed under the term of six months’ imprisonment. As to the charge\n\nbrought under s 29(3) of the Films Act, although the appellant was sentenced on it to six\n\nmonths’ imprisonment, the appellant had also been sentenced to six months’\n\nimprisonment on the second, correctly worded charge under s 29(3). As such, the cumulative\n\nterm of six months’ imprisonment which the appellant received for the five\n\nVCD-related offences was not attributable solely to the defective charge brought under s\n\n29(3).12 In light of the foregoing, I granted the application for criminal\n\nrevision, amended the two defective charges, and duly convicted the appellant on them.The appeal against sentence13 The only grounds cited by the appellant for his appeal against\n\nsentence were a plea for leniency and the contention that the sentence was too heavy. In\n\nrespect of the plea for leniency, I had little hesitation in dismissing it. Taking into\n\naccount the appellant’s numerous criminal antecedents and the serious nature of the\n\ncharges he was sentenced for in the court below, I concluded that it was not appropriate\n\nfor me to exercise leniency in the present case.14 As for the contention that the sentence was too heavy, I noted that\n\nthe sentence of seven years’ imprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane had been imposed\n\nin respect of seven offences. The bulk of the sentences was accounted for by the\n\nconviction for robbery with hurt, for which the appellant was sentenced to six years’\n\nimprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. The conviction for possession of an offensive\n\nweapon accounted for the remaining six strokes of the cane, and six months’\n\nimprisonment. The remaining six months’ imprisonment related to four Films Act\n\noffences and the conviction for exhibiting obscene VCD covers, for which, as noted above,\n\nthe appellant had been given varying sentences of one month’s to six months’\n\nimprisonment.15 I found no cause for complaint in the individual sentences imposed.\n\nThe minimum mandatory sentence for robbery with hurt under s 394 of the Penal Code is five\n\nyears’ imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane. As for possession of an offensive\n\nweapon, the sentence of six months’ imprisonment was well below the maximum sentence\n\nof three years’ imprisonment, and the six strokes of the cane were mandatory.\n\nFinally, as to the five offences relating to the VCDs, the sentence was clearly not\n\nmanifestly excessive as, individually, they fell far short of the maximum term for these\n\noffencesandthe district judge allowed them to all run concurrently.16 Neither did I find that the total sentence of seven years’\n\nimprisonment and 18 strokes of the cane to be manifestly excessive. As I had already\n\nnoted, the bulk of the sentences was taken up by the sentence for robbery with hurt. I\n\nfound that the additional one year’s imprisonment and six strokes of the cane was\n\nreasonable considering that it was meant to account for the remaining six offences, and\n\nwas not in any way manifestly excessive.17 As such, I dismissed the appeal against sentence.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
