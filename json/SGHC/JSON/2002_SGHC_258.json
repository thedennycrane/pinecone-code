        "The facts": "1.        By a contract dated 20 May\n\n2000 (the Contract), the first defendants, Hola Development Pte Ltd (Hola) employed Hiap\n\nTian Soon Construction Pte Ltd (the first plaintiffs) to construct a light industrial\n\nflatted factory with a basement car park at Ubi Avenue 1. The contract period commenced on\n\n24 July 2000 and was to end 15 months later (in October 2001). The first plaintiffs\n\ncommenced piling works on or about 21 July 2000 and these works were completed in\n\nSeptember 2000. In reliance upon two interim payment certificates issued by Mr Cheong\n\nJiong Chian from the firm of IMT Architects (the Architects), Interim Certificate Nos 1\n\nand 2, certifying that the piles were satisfactorily installed, Hola made payment to the\n\nfirst plaintiffs for the installed piles.2.        The first plaintiffs then\n\nbegan excavation works using the ‘open cut method’ for the basement excavation\n\nwithout obtaining prior approval from ASE Designtec, the project structural engineers, or\n\nthe Building and Construction Authority (BCA). The excavation works resulted in soil\n\nmovement which in turn damaged the piles that had been installed, causing substantial\n\ndelays to the project. By this time, Interim Certificate Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 had already\n\nbeen issued. Upon realising the full extent of the defects, Hola’s General Manager,\n\nMr Lau Yaw Seng (Lau) approached the Architects to take into consideration the defective\n\npiles and works by way of a retrospective valuation of all work done when issuing the\n\nsubsequent interim certificates. The Architects however, declined to certify the cost of\n\nthe rectification works in subsequent interim certificates. Consequently, Hola decided to\n\nwithhold payment of the sums certified under the said interim certificates.3.        On 18 July 2001, the first\n\nplaintiffs terminated the Contract on the grounds of non-payment by Hola. Hola however\n\nasserted that the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was conduct amounting to\n\nan unlawful repudiation of the Contract and accepted this repudiation, bringing the\n\nContract to an end. Hola called on the performance bond furnished by the first plaintiffs,\n\nwhich had been guaranteed by the second plaintiff Goh Kim Hock (Goh) who is the first\n\nplaintiffs' director.4.        On 22 October 2001, the\n\nfirst plaintiffs applied for an injunction to restrain Hola from receiving any monies\n\nunder the performance bond pending trial of this action. The injunction was granted on 15\n\nJanuary 2002. On 8 February 2002, the first plaintiffs discontinued this action against\n\nthe second defendant Lonpac Insurance Bhd, who had issued the performance bond in favour\n\nof Hola.",
        "The pleadings": "5.        The first plaintiffs'\n\nclaim against Hola was for a sum of $457,152.13, being the retention sum and the amount\n\ncertified under several interim payment certificates issued by the Architects. This amount\n\nwas disputed by Hola, who argued that the first plaintiffs had failed to take into\n\nconsideration the fact that one of the interim payment certificates (No. 13), amounted to\n\na negative certification to reflect items that were allegedly removed from the building\n\nsite when the first plaintiffs vacated the premises. Hola argued therefore that the\n\ncorrect sum due under the payment certificates (as well as the retention sum) should only\n\nbe $358,107.94.6.        Hola refused to make\n\npayment under the payment certificates on the ground that they had valid claims against\n\nthe first plaintiffs for defective building work which they purported to set-off against\n\nthe certified amount due under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10; this amounted to\n\n$214,196.90.7.        Further, Hola asserted\n\nvarious counterclaims inter alia, for their losses resulting from the first plaintiffs'\n\nalleged invalid determination as well as from the delay in the progress of their work and\n\nin the hand-over of the site. Finally, Hola argued that it was entitled to receive the\n\nfull sum of $1,009,000.00 pursuant to the performance bond procured by the plaintiffs.",
        "The issues": "8.        At the outset, the parties\n\nwere informed that only liability would be determined at the trial and the quantum of\n\ndamages would be decided by the Registrar at a later stage, if necessary.",
        "The plaintiffs' case": "9.        The first issue which I\n\nhad to consider was whether the first plaintiffs' claim against Hola should succeed.10.        To decide this point, it\n\nwas necessary to consider whether the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract on 18\n\nJuly 2001 was valid. The first plaintiffs argued that it had terminated the Contract in\n\naccordance with cl 26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract on the ground that Hola had\n\nfailed to pay monies due to them under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Clause\n\n26(1)(a) of the Conditions of Contract provides:Without prejudice to any other rights and remedies which\n\n    the Contractor may possess, if(a)    The Employer does not pay to the Contractor the amount due on any\n\n    certificate within the Period for Honouring Certificates named in the appendix to these\n\n    Conditions and continues such default for seven days after receipt by registered post or\n\n    recorded delivery of a notice from the Contractor stating that notice of determination\n\n    under this Condition will be served if payment is not made within seven days from receipt\n\n    thereof; or(b)    …(c)    …(d)    …then the Contractors may thereupon by notice by registered post or\n\n    recorded delivery to the Employer or Architect forthwith determine the employment of the\n\n    Contractor under this Contract; provided that such notice shall not be given unreasonably\n\n    or vexatiously.’11.        While conceding the\n\nnon-payment, Hola contended that they had a valid set-off in respect of damaged and\n\ndefective piles as against Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10. Pursuant to this right\n\nof set-off, Hola claimed to withhold the balance amount due under Interim Certificates\n\nNos. 8, 9 and 10 pending rectification of the defective piles. Hola thus argued that the\n\nfirst plaintiffs' termination of the Contract was invalid and amounted to an unlawful\n\nrepudiation.",
        "Was Hola’s set-off valid?": "12.        The law on equitable\n\nset-off is clear. The doctrine has its roots in the historical intervention of the courts\n\nof equity to allow deductions whenever there were good equitable grounds for directly\n\nimpeaching the demand which the plaintiff-creditor was seeking to enforce. The only\n\ncross-claims that may be deducted therefrom are those that arise out of the same\n\ntransaction or are so closely connected with the plaintiff’s demands that it would be\n\nmanifestly unjust to allow him to enforce payment without taking account of the\n\ncross-claim. As Chao J noted inOCWS Logistics v Soon Meng Construction Pte Ltd[1999] 2 SLR 376:An unliquidated claim of the defendant for damages could\n\n    be set-off if it arose from the same transaction as the claim of the plaintiff or was\n\n    closely connected with the subject matter of the claim: this was equitable set-off, seeHanak\n\n    v Green[1958] 2 QB 9 andMorgan & Son Ltd v Martin Johnson & Co Ltd[1949] 1 KB 107.13.        Similarly, the Court of\n\nAppeal inPacific RimInvestments Pte Ltd v Lam Seng Tiong & Anor[1995] 3 SLR 1found (at p 14) that:…the exercise of equitable set-off is only\n\n    permitted, if equitable considerations support such an exercise. It arises where there are\n\n    good equitable grounds for directly impeaching the title to the legal demand which the\n\n    creditor is seeking to enforce. As Lord Denning MR succinctly said inThe Nanfri,at pp 974-975:…it is not every cross-claim which can be deducted. It is only\n\n      cross-claims that arise out of the same transaction or are closely connected with it. And\n\n      it is only cross-claims which go directly to impeach the plaintiff’s demands, that\n\n      is, so closely connected with his demands that it would be manifestly unjust to allow him\n\n      to enforce payment without taking into account his cross-claim.’14.        I turn next to consider\n\nwhether Hola had a valid defence of set-off to the first plaintiffs' claim.15.        The first plaintiffs did\n\nnot deny responsibility in respect of the defective piles. In fact, they conceded\n\nliability for the damaged piles and for rectification costs of 158 piles. That would mean\n\nthat the first plaintiffs conceded that Hola has a valid claim for damages. However, the\n\nfirst plaintiffs objected to Hola’s claim of having a valid set-off at the time when\n\npayment became due under the certificates, on the ground that any common law right to\n\nset-off had been excluded by the Contract.16.        It is therefore necessary\n\nto consider whether, by the terms of the Contract between the first plaintiffs and Hola,\n\nthe latter's right of set-off had been excluded.",
        "Was Hola’s right of set-off excluded by the Contract?": "17.        It is trite law that\n\nparties may, by contract, exclude the remedy of equitable set-off. InPacific Rim\n\nInvestments (supra), the Court of Appeal noted that the right to an equitable set-off\n\nmay be expressly excluded by contract. It would suffice if the contract contained clear\n\nwords which excluded the right to set off, either expressly or by necessary implication: (Kum\n\nLeng General Contractor v Hytech Builders Pte Ltd[1996] 1 SLR 751andAurum\n\nBuilding Services (Pte) Ltd v Greatearth Construction Pte Ltd[1994] 3 SLR 330).18.        InKum Leng General\n\nContractor v Hytech Builders Pte Ltd[1996] 1 SLR 751, Rajendran J cited (at p 755)Gilbert-Ash\n\n(Northern) Ltd v Modern Engineering (Bristol) Ltd[1974] AC 689 with approval, quoting\n\nDiplock LJ:It is, of course, open to parties to a contract for sale\n\n    of goods or for work and labour or for both to exclude by express agreement a remedy for\n\n    its breach which would otherwise arise by operation of law or such remedy may be excluded\n\n    by usage binding upon the parties…But in construing such a contract one starts with\n\n    the presumption that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising\n\n    by operation of law, and clear express words must be used in order to rebut this\n\n    presumption.19.        Here, the first\n\nplaintiffs argued that theonlymechanism for Hola to have recovered the cost of\n\nrectifying the damaged work, by way of set-off, is that provided for in cl 2(1) of the\n\nConditions of Contract which states:The Contractor shall (subject to sub-clauses (2) and (3)\n\n    of this Condition) forthwith comply with all instructions issued to him by the Architect\n\n    in regard to any matter in respect of which the Architect is expressly empowered by these\n\n    Conditions to issue instructions. If within seven days after receipt of a written notice\n\n    from the Architect requiring compliance with an instruction the Contractor does not comply\n\n    therewith, then the Employer may employ and pay other persons to execute any workwhatsoever which may be necessary to give effect to such instruction and all\n\n    costs incurred in connection with such employment shall be recoverable from the Contractor\n\n    by the Employer as a debt or may be deducted by him from any monies due or to become due\n\n    to the Contractor under this Contract.20.        The first plaintiffs\n\nsubmitted that on a true construction of cl 2(1), Hola was only able to recover the cost\n\nof rectifying damaged work by way of set-off, if the Architects had issued an instruction\n\nto the first plaintiffs to rectify the damaged work and, the first plaintiffs had failed\n\nto comply with such instruction or do any rectification, causing Hola to engage another\n\ncontractor to rectify the work. The first plaintiffs argued that prior to 18 July 2001,\n\nHola had not employed another contractor to carry out the rectification work; therefore,\n\nHola had no right of set-off before this date.21.        To decide this point, I\n\nconsidered the case ofLojan Properties Pte Ltd v Tropicon Contractors Pte Ltd[1991] SLR 80, where one of the issues before the Court of Appeal was whether on the true\n\ninterpretation of the contract provisions, the appellants were entitled to deduct from the\n\namounts certified by the architects under an interim certificate of payment, sums of money\n\nwhich the appellants claimed to have expended on the rectification of defective works\n\nwhich the respondents had failed to do. The Court of Appeal agreed with the trial\n\njudge’s findings that the right of set-off had been excluded by the contract used\n\nbetween the parties.22.        It is noteworthy that the\n\ncontract used by the parties inLojan Propertieswas based on the Revised Standard\n\nForm of the Singapore Institute of Architects (Revised SIA Form). As Karthigesu JA noted\n\n(at p 84C):The unique features of the Conditions of Contract are\n\n    that the contractor is assured of regular periodic payments during the period the contract\n\n    works are in progress based on a retrospective revaluation of all work carried out under\n\n    the contract (see cl 31(1) and (2)) and subject to the exceptions mentioned in cl 31(11)\n\n    the contractor is put in a position to enforce payment if payment is not made on the due\n\n    date by action in the courts.23.        Clause 31(11) of the\n\nConditions of Contract inLojan Propertiesprovided:No certificate of the Architect shall be final and\n\n    binding in any dispute between the employer and the contractor, whether before an\n\n    arbitrator or in the courts, save only that,in the absence of fraud or improper\n\n    pressure or interference by either party, full effect by way of summary judgment or\n\n    interim award or otherwise shall, in the absence of express provision, be given to all\n\n    decisions and certificates of the architect…until final judgment or award, as the\n\n    case may be, and until such final judgment or awardsuch decision or certificates\n\n    shall…be binding on the employer and the contractorin relation to any matter\n\n    which, under the terms of the contract, the Architect has as a fact taken into account or\n\n    allowed or disallowed, or any disputed matter upon which under the terms of the contract\n\n    he has as a fact ruled, in his certificates or the terms of the contract….[emphasis\n\n    added].24.        It is clear that in\n\ncoming to its decision, the court was heavily influenced by the unique features of the\n\ncontract. Karthigesu JA specifically approved the following passage from the first\n\ninstance judgment, where the judge, referring to cl 31(11), said:It is intended that the contractor be paid the amounts\n\n    expressed to be payable in the interim certificates, and if no payment is made by the\n\n    employer it is intended to enable the contractor in the absence of fraud, improper\n\n    pressure or interference or in the absence of express provisions, to obtain quick summary\n\n    judgment for the amounts certified as due. In so far as any sum claimed by the employer is\n\n    concerned, only the amounts expressly deductible under the contract may be set off against\n\n    the amount due under the interim certificate. I therefore come to the conclusion that\n\n    subject to any deduction or set-off as provided expressly in the contract, the amounts\n\n    certified in the interim certificates are due and payable to the plaintiffs.25.        The contract between the\n\nparties was based on the 1980 version of ‘Agreement and Schedule of Conditions of\n\nBuilding Contract (Private edition without quantities)’, which is in turn based\n\nlargely on the RIBA/ JCT forms. The contract did not contain cl 31(11) and the\n\ncorresponding concept of ‘temporary finality’ which was introduced in the\n\nRevised SIA Form specifically to limit the Employer’s right of set-off. The absence\n\nof cl 31(11) or a clause substantially similar to it in the contract was fatal to the\n\nfirst plaintiffs' argument -- that the contract had excluded Hola’s right of set-off.26.        The first plaintiffs\n\ncitedPembanaan Leow Tuck Chui & Sons Sdn Bhd v Dr Leela’s Medical Centre Sdn\n\nBhd[1995] 2 MLJ 57in support of their contention. This was a decision of the Supreme\n\nCourt of Kuala Lumpur where it was held that the express enumeration of permitted set-offs\n\nin the contract implied that the employer was limited to make deductions which fell\n\nstrictly within the scope of permitted set-offs on the basis of theexpressio uniusprinciple. The court found that there were seven express provisions in the contract which\n\npermitted the employer to set-off sums. The court held that having regard to these\n\nprovisions, and applying theexpressio uniusprinciple, the common law right of\n\nset-off had been extinguished.27.        It is interesting to note\n\nthat the contract inPembanaanwas very similar to the present contract between the\n\nfirst plaintiffs and Hola. Clause 2(1) in thePembanaancontract is identical to cl\n\n2(1) of the Contract and states:The contractor shall (subject to sub-clauses (2) and (3)\n\n    of this condition) forthwith comply with all instructions issued to him by the architect\n\n    in regard to any matter in respect of which the architect is expressly empowered by these\n\n    conditions to issue instructions. If within seven days after receipt of a written notice\n\n    from the architect requiring compliance with an instruction the contractor does not comply\n\n    therewith, then the employer may employ and pay other persons to execute any work\n\n    whatsoever which may be necessary to give effect to such instruction and all costs\n\n    incurred in connection with such employment shall be recoverable from the contractor by\n\n    the employer as a debt or may be deducted by him from any monies due or to become due to\n\n    the contractor under this contract.28.        The Supreme Court inPembanaanheld that the builder was under no contractual obligation to comply with the\n\nemployer’s complaints relating to defective works unless supported by written\n\ninstructions issued by the Architects pursuant to cl 2(1). The ordinary common law right\n\nof set-off had been extinguished, not expressly but by clear implication. As Edgar Joseph\n\nJr FCJ noted (at p 78):In our view, therefore, the express enumeration of\n\n    permitted set-offs in a contract or sub-contract, can imply that a defendant builder or\n\n    main contractor, as the case may be, is limited to making such deductions from the amounts\n\n    claimed as fall strictly within the scope of permitted set-offs, and nothing else, on the\n\n    basis of theexpressio uniusprinciple.29.        With respect, the problem\n\nwith the Supreme Court’s reasoning is that it runs counter to the decision of the\n\nHouse of Lords inGilbert-Ash Ltd v Modern Engineering[1974] AC 689. In that case,\n\nthe employer was empowered by three (3) conditions in the contract to make deductions from\n\nthe amount certified under interim certificates, for breaches of particular warranties by\n\nthe contractor. Lord Diplock noted (at p 719):The effect of these conditions is to substitute for the\n\n    sums which would be deductible from the price by operation of law in respect of those\n\n    breaches of contract, sums calculated in the manner agreed.The expressio unius rule of\n\n    construction cannot be prayed in aid to exclude the right of the employer to set up\n\n    breaches of other warranties in diminution or extinction of the instalment of the purchase\n\n    price stated in the certificate as due[emphasis added.]30.        There is much merit in\n\nLord Diplock’s observations. Apart from the obvious danger of excessive reliance on\n\ntheexpressio uniusprinciple which requires one to infer specific intent from\n\nsilence, it is clear that the law presumes that parties are entitled to all legal\n\nremedies, including the defence of set-off. As Goff LJ stated (at p 988B inThe Nanfri;\n\nFederal Commerce & Navigation Co. Ltd v Molena Alpha Inc[1978] 1 QB 927, (a case\n\nwhere charterers sought to deduct from the hire due to the owners the damages arising from\n\nthe vessel’s loss of speed):First, it may be said that this charterparty contains\n\n    express provisions in clauses 11 and 14 allowing deductions and therefore on the principle\n\n    expressio unius est exclusio alterius they should not be allowed in any other cases. In my\n\n    judgment, however, that is not sufficient because equitable set-off is part of the general\n\n    law and can only be excluded by clear provisions to that effect, and such an inference as\n\n    I am now considering is not sufficient.31.        While it is clearly\n\npossible to exclude any or all of these remedies by way of contract, this must be done\n\nclearly and unequivocally; one effective means of exclusion is by way of the\n\n‘temporary finality’ provision, as in cl 31(11) of the Revised SIA Form. It is\n\nequally clear that the position in Singapore differs from that stated inPembanaanas the Court of Appeal inPacific RimInvestmentshas quotedThe Nanfriwith approval.32.        The rule laid down inGilbert-Ashis clear and simple to apply. In relation to a building contract, one starts with the\n\npresumption that each party is to be entitled to all those remedies for breach as would\n\narise by operation of law, including the right of set-off. However, it is open to parties\n\nto rebut that presumption by contrary provisions in the contract, provided that clear and\n\nunequivocal words are used. In the present context, it was open to the parties to exclude\n\nthe defence of set-off, by using the SIA Revised Form for example, or, if the RIBA form\n\nwas preferred, by crafting additional provisions to import the concept of ‘temporary\n\nfinality’ into the contract. The parties did not choose to do so and it can only be\n\ninferred that Hola’s right of set-off remained intact. I therefore find that\n\nHola’s right of set-off had not been excluded by Contract.",
        "Had the first plaintiffs been informed that Hola intended to exercise\n\nthe right of set-off?": "33.        I noted the first\n\nplaintiffs' contention that they had not been informed of Hola’s intention to set-off\n\nthe amounts due under Interim Certificates Nos. 8, 9 and 10; I reject their contention\n\nthat this was required for set-off. Even if I am wrong on this point, I am prepared to\n\naccept Lau’s testimony that he had orally informed the first plaintiffs of his\n\nintention to set off the amounts, by 24 April 2002. In his written testimony (at para 50)\n\nLau stated:…Hiap Tian Soon alleged by letter dated 25 July\n\n    2001 that Hola’s claim was a sham and was an excuse to justify the non-payment of the\n\n    interim certificates. This was definitely not true since I had earlier informed Goh Kim\n\n    Hock [the second plaintiff] of my intention when he came to look for me for payment. I had\n\n    also told him on a number of occasions that payment would not be made until the damaged\n\n    piles were rectified and stated so in my letter to the first plaintiffs dated 31 July\n\n    2001…",
        "Were Hola’s losses quantifiable by a reasonable assessment made in\n\ngood faith?": "34.        The next main contention\n\non the part of the first plaintiffs in relation to the set-off was, that Hola’s\n\nlosses in relation to the defective piles were not ‘quantifiable by means of a\n\nreasonable assessment made in good faith’. In support of this argument, the first\n\nplaintiffs pointed out that the project's quantity surveyor, Ian Chng Cost Consultants\n\n(the Quantity Surveyor) only replied with a cost assessment on 23 July 2001, after the\n\nfirst plaintiffs' purported termination of the Contract. The first plaintiffs argued that\n\nHola had not quantified their damages in good faith at the time they purported to set-off\n\ntheir claim, and were therefore precluded from relying on the defence of equitable\n\nset-off. As counsel for the first plaintiffs submitted:Even if the right to set-off did arise, the damages or\n\n    cost of rectifying the piles was never quantified by means of a reasonable assessment made\n\n    in good faith, at least prior to the date of the termination of the Contract (i.e. 18 July\n\n    2001).35.        Hola on the other hand,\n\nargued that while a reasonable assessment of the unliquidated damages must be made in good\n\nfaith in order for the right of equitable set-off to be exercised, the party purporting to\n\nexercise the set-off need not arrive at an accurate and exact figure.36.        It is clear fromPacific\n\nRim Investmentsthat equitable set-off may only be exercised where the loss is\n\nquantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith. As Thean JA noted inPacific\n\nRim Investments(at p 11):The majority of the Court of Appeal [inThe Nanfri],\n\n    Lord Denning MR and Goff LJ, agreed that in the circumstances the appellant charterers\n\n    were entitled to an equitable set-off and to deduct from the hire, sums as loss arising\n\n    from the loss of speed because the claims were so closely connected,provided that the\n\n    unliquidated loss was quantifiable by means of a reasonable assessment made in good faith[emphasis added.]37.        Indeed, inThe Nanfri,\n\nLord Denning MR specifically noted (at p 975E):If the charterer quantifies his loss by a reasonable\n\n    assessment made in good faith – and deducts the sum quantified – then he is not\n\n    in default. The shipowner cannot withdraw his vessel on account of non-payment of hire nor\n\n    hold him guilty at that point of any breach of contract. If it subsequently turns out that\n\n    he has deducted too much, the shipowner can of course recover the balance. But that is\n\n    all.38.        It is clear from the\n\nabove passage that all that is required from the party purporting to exercise the right of\n\nset-off is, that he seeks to quantify his loss in a bona fide way by reasonable means. The\n\nparty does not actually have to produce a specific and final figure, quantified by\n\nprofessional quantity surveyors, contrary to what the first plaintiffs suggested.\n\nSimilarly, the fact that the estimated figure may eventually turn out to be too high or\n\ntoo low is not, in itself, sufficient to preclude a party from relying on set-off as a\n\ndefence.39.        There was evidence that\n\nsome attempts were made by Hola to obtain an estimate of the cost of the rectification\n\nworks. Lau testified (para 40 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief) that he had obtained\n\na verbal estimate from the Quantity Surveyor for the sum of S$200,000.00 prior to the\n\npurported termination:…I do remember that during the course of these\n\n    discussions in or about April 2001, one of the Consultants had estimated the cost of the\n\n    rectification of the damaged piles to be in the region of $200,000.00.40.        Wong Kwong Yow of ASE\n\nDesigntec (the structural engineer) had also deposed (para 28 of his affidavit) to this\n\ndiscussion and the verbal estimate that was offered, in the following terms:[Mr Peter Lau] also requested for an estimate of the\n\n    cost of repairs. I remember that during the discussion, the sum of $200,000.00 was brought\n\n    up in passing, being the estimated cost of rectification for the defective piles.41.        In addition, Lau obtained\n\na second verbal estimate from a friend of his who was in the construction industry (who\n\ndid not testify) who informed Lau that the estimated cost of repairs would be\n\napproximately $300,000.00. However, no evidence was offered by Hola to explain how these\n\nestimates were arrived at.42.        It is important to\n\nremember that what is reasonable depends on the facts of each case. In deciding what a\n\nreasonable assessment is, the court must take into account various factors. I propose to\n\nlist just a few factors.43.        First, the quantum of the\n\nsum purported to be set-off is highly relevant. Here, Hola were seeking to set-off a sum\n\nof $214,196.90, which is by no means a small amount. Further, this sum would, but for the\n\nset-off, have clearly been due to the first plaintiffs, as these sums were certified by\n\nthe Architects. Secondly, the court must consider the complexity of the rectification\n\nworks required. While parties are clearly not required to have ascertained the exact cause\n\nof the problem or calculated the rectification cost down to the last dollar, they should\n\nat least draw a distinction between rectification which is easily quantifiable (e.g. if\n\nall that was required was the purchase of certain materials to replace defective\n\nmaterials) and that which would clearly require closer consideration such as in this case,\n\nwhere different parties were giving differing quotes. In the latter instance, the party\n\nwho is purporting to exercise the right of set-off will be held to a higher standard than\n\nhe would have been held to in the first situation. While, as I have stated earlier, it\n\nwould not have been necessary for Hola to have obtained a full quantity surveyor’s\n\nreport in order to meet the reasonableness requirement, they certainly must have done more\n\nthan they actually did. It is not enough to obtain two casual verbal estimates in passing;\n\nat the very least, Hola must have had some basis or engaged in some form of rational\n\nanalysis before coming to an estimate of the costs involved. I find that the two estimates\n\nused by Hola were not reasonable and that Hola had failed to show that the losses had been\n\nquantified by means of a reasonable assessment.44.        Consequently, it is not\n\nopen to Hola to rely on the defence of equitable set-off as, the loss in respect of which\n\nthey were purporting to exercise the set-off was not quantifiable by means of a reasonable\n\nassessment made in good faith. As such, the first plaintiffs' termination of the Contract\n\nwas valid.",
        "Quantum of the first plaintiffs' claim": "45.        The next issue which I\n\nhave to consider is whether the quantum claimed by the first plaintiffs was appropriate.\n\nAssuming their claim against Hola was valid, Hola should be liable for the total amount\n\ncertified under the interim payment certificates and which remains outstanding. Hola had\n\nargued that the sum should be $358,107.94 whereas the first plaintiffs put forward a\n\nhigher figure of $457,152.13, which failed to take into account Interim Certificate No 13\n\n(which showed a negative certification of $84,050.76). As the total amount certified under\n\nall the interim payment certificates came to $1,310,661.83 and, by the plaintiffs' own\n\nevidence, the amount received from Hola was $952,553.89, the quantum of the first\n\nplaintiffs' claim should logically be the difference between the two (2) amounts, which is\n\nHola’s figure of $358,107.94. However, in the event the first plaintiffs disagree\n\nwith my calculations, I direct the Registrar to assess the amount due and owing to them.",
        "Hola’s counterclaims": "46.        I next turn to consider\n\nwhether Hola’s counterclaims have any merit.",
        "Damages for the delay in the progress of the plaintiff’s work": "47.        Hola argued that the\n\nfirst plaintiffs were in breach of their obligation to proceed regularly and diligently,\n\npursuant to cl 25 of the Contract which provides:(1) If the Contractor shall make default in any one or\n\n    more of the following respects, that is to say:-…(a)    If he fails to proceed regularly and diligently with the Works or(b)    …(c)    …,then the Architectmay give to him a notice by registered post or\n\n      recorded delivery specifying the default, and if the Contractor either shall continue such\n\n      default for fourteen days after receipt of such notice or shall at any time thereafter\n\n      repeat such default (whether previously repeated or not), then the Employer without\n\n      prejudice to other rights or remedies, may within ten days after such continuance or\n\n      repetition by notice by registered post or recorded delivery forthwith determine the\n\n      employment of the Contractor under this Contract provided that such notice shall not be\n\n      given unreasonably or vexatiously.48.        Against this, the first\n\nplaintiffs contended that their obligation was only to complete the project by the date of\n\ncompletion provided for in the Contract. Since they had validly terminated the Contract\n\nbefore this date, it would be illogical to speak about them being responsible for the\n\ndelay in the completion of the project.49.        Following the Court of\n\nAppeal’s decision inJurong Engineering Ltd v Paccan Building Technology Pte Ltd[1999] 3 SLR 667, the law on this point is clear. The main contractors inJurong\n\nEngineeringterminated the subcontract on the grounds that the subcontractor had\n\nfailed to proceed with reasonable diligence and had thus breached the agreement between\n\nthe parties. The court held that ‘reasonable diligence’ could only be determined\n\nby pacing the progress of the subcontractor’s work against the subcontract programme.\n\nAs Goh J opined (at p 668):If the progress of the subcontract works consistently\n\n    lagged behind and did not keep pace with the subcontract programme, then the respondents\n\n    [subcontractors] could not be said to be progressing with reasonable diligence.50.        Goh J also quotedHudson’s\n\nBuilding and Engineering Contracts(11 ed vol 2 paras 9-034 and 9-035 (where it was\n\nstated that ‘..it would be absurd, it is submitted, if the owner was to be without\n\nremedy until after a perhaps distant completion date…’.51.        While the material\n\ncontractual term inJurong Engineeringwas ‘reasonable diligence’, I am\n\nof the view that the same principles should apply when one is dealing with the phrase\n\n‘regularly and diligently’, as was used in the Contract. On the facts before me,\n\nI find that the first plaintiffs' progress of work consistently lagged behind the\n\nconstruction programme which they had furnished to Hola and the Architects. By January\n\n2001, some six (6) months after the date of commencement of the work, the first plaintiffs\n\nwere already 2 months in delay when the progress of their work was measured against the\n\nconstruction programme they had submitted. This delay was very serious in the light of the\n\nfact that the contractual completion date was 9 October 2001, a mere 10 months away.\n\nFurther, it should be noted that the first plaintiffs persisted in their delay despite\n\nreminders from Hola to expedite the work.52.        Despite the Architects'\n\nrequest (on or about 19 January 2001) that the first plaintiffs expedite the work and\n\nsubmit a revised master programme which incorporated efforts to make up for lost time, the\n\nlatter submitted a revised construction programme pushing back the completion date to\n\nDecember 2001. However, the first plaintiffs were soon in delay again, even in respect of\n\nthe revised programme. By April 2001, they were more than 3 months behind the revised\n\nschedule A second revised programme submitted in or about May 2001, showing an expected\n\ncompletion date of April 2002. However, by 19 June 2001, the first plaintiffs reported\n\nthat they were 50 days behind schedule under the second revised programme.53.        I cannot accept the first\n\nplaintiffs' contention that they were at all times ready and willing to carry out\n\nrectification works and that the delay was in fact caused by the fact that the BCA had not\n\ngiven approval to carry out such rectification. It is clear from the evidence that the\n\nfirst plaintiffs had failed to do even those rectification works that did not need BCA\n\napproval; for example, they failed to produce the necessary soil and earth movement\n\nreports. Whilst the delay began in late 2000 or early 2001, soon after the date of\n\ncommencement, I find that the first plaintiffs only submitted rectification proposals as\n\nlate as June 2001. This was clear from the architect’s testimony in cross-examination\n\n(N/E 135-136):Q: In relation to damaged piles and sewer, you agree 1stPlaintiffs were anxious to rectify?A: No.Q: You agree 1stPlaintiffs showed willingness to rectify\n\n    the damaged works?A: No.Q: Why?A: Despite several reminders from my engineer to submit ECC surveys,\n\n    they were slow in responding despite several reminders at site meetings week after week.Q: But 1stPlaintiffs complied with your engineer’s\n\n    instructions and submitted rectification proposals?A: Eventually yes they did submit plan quite late, June-July 2001, 2-3\n\n    months later.54.        The first plaintiffs had\n\nalso argued that even on the assumption that the progress of works was in delay, this\n\nwould not by itself be a breach of contract, as cl 25 only gave Hola a right to determine\n\ntheir employment. This argument must be rejected in the light ofJurong Engineeringwhere, the Court of Appeal clearly envisaged that the breach of the obligation to proceed\n\nwith reasonable diligence will give rise to damages as well as to a right to terminate the\n\ncontractor’s employment. It should be noted that the Court of Appeal quoted the\n\nfollowing extract fromHudson’s Building and Engineering Contracts(11 ed vol\n\n2 para 9-034) with approval:…even in the absence of an express term for due\n\n    diligence and of any linked express termination clause, both such terms require to be\n\n    implied by law, in construction contracts and subcontracts generally, as a matter of\n\n    business efficacy. The primary obligation will, it is submitted, sound in damagesif within the rules of remoteness, as where the nature of the work undertaken indicates\n\n    that work by other contractors of the owner, or in a subcontract of the main contractor,\n\n    or commitments entered into with neighbours or others, are within the contemplation of the\n\n    contract as being dependent on the maintenance of a reasonable rate of\n\n    progress….[emphasis added.]55.        I therefore allow\n\nHola’s counterclaim for loss and damages for breach of the Contract arising from the\n\nfirst plaintiffs' failure to proceed with reasonable diligence.",
        "Delay in handing over the site": "56.        The Contract was\n\nterminated on 18 July 2001. Pursuant to cl 26(2)(a) of the Conditions of Contract, the\n\ncontractor was obliged to hand over the site of the project within 7 days, i.e. by 24 July\n\n2001. However, the site was only handed over by the first plaintiffs on 3 October 2001.\n\nHola claimed that the first plaintiffs were liable for the losses suffered by Hola arising\n\nfrom the delay in the hand-over of the site, between 24 July 2001 and 3 October 2001. The\n\nfirst plaintiffs only conceded liability in respect of the delay to hand over the site,\n\nbetween 27 September 2001 and 3 October 2001. Are the first plaintiffs liable for any loss\n\nsuffered by Hola, arising from the delay in handing over, between 24 July and 27\n\nSeptember, 2001?57.        Hola argued that there is\n\nno clear evidence that they had waived their right to damages against the first plaintiffs\n\nfor the late hand-over of the site between 24 July 2001 and 27 September 2001. The company\n\nargued that it had never consented to the late hand-over, and that this was clear from\n\nreminders that the Architects sent to the first plaintiffs requesting for the hand-over of\n\nthe site In his written testimony the architect (Cheong Jiong Chian) deposed (at paras\n\n38-41 of his affidavit):Initially I had waited for Hiap Tian Soon to contact me\n\n    to arrange a date for the handover of the site. However when Hiap Tian Soon failed to\n\n    contact me to handover the site, I directed Hiap Tian Soon by way of a letter dated 29\n\n    August 2001 to the handover of the site on 4 September 2001.However, in a letter dated 4 September 2001, Hiap Tian Soon refused to\n\n    do so on the basis that they had not been paid for interim certificates 8, 9 and 10 and\n\n    11. I then replied in a letter dated 7 September 2001 that the site needed to be handed\n\n    over so that the tenderers could conduct a site inspection as part of their preparations\n\n    for the new tender. In this respect I then suggested 11 September 2001 for the handover of\n\n    the site. Hiap Tian Soon however proposed to hand over the site on 27 September 2001 in a\n\n    letter dated 10 September 2001.By now, Hola noted with concern the inordinate delay by Hiap Tian Soon\n\n    to hand over the site after the termination of the contract. In a letter dated 18\n\n    September 2001, which I forwarded to Hiap Tian Soon, Hola reiterated the urgency in taking\n\n    over possession of the site and gave a deadline for the handover of the site – 27\n\n    September 2001, failing which Hiap Tian Soon would be in trespass…Notwithstanding this, Hiap Tian Soon only gave back possession of the\n\n    site to Hola on or about 3 October 2001. When Hiap Tian Soon failed to hand over the site\n\n    by 27 September 2001, I reminded them in a letter dated 28 September 2001 that they would\n\n    be responsible for any delay in handing over the possession of the site back to\n\n    Hola…’58.        I have not seen\n\nHola’s letter dated 18 September 2001 as it was not tendered as evidence. After\n\nconsidering the architect’s testimony and the first plaintiffs' submissions, I find\n\nthat the first plaintiffs are not liable for the delay for the period between 24 July 2001\n\nand 4 September 2001, since Hola were themselves in delay in checking on the progress of\n\nthe hand-over and, did not write to the first plaintiffs until 29 August 2001 and, had\n\nauthorised the first plaintiffs to remain on the site until 4 September 2001 in that\n\nletter. In respect of the period 4-27 September 2001, I accept the architect’s\n\ntestimony that Hola had in fact consented to Hiap Tian Soon’s handing over of the\n\nsite on 27 September 2001. From the architect’s testimony, it appeared that by the\n\nletter of 18 September, Hola allowed the first plaintiffs to remain on the site until 27\n\nSeptember 2001, while noting that thereafter, the first plaintiffs would be regarded as\n\nbeing in trespass.59.        I find that the first\n\nplaintiffs are not liable for the delay in handing-over of the site, between 24 July 2001\n\nand 27 September 2001.",
        "The performance bond": "60.        Pursuant to the Letter of\n\nAward dated 20 May 2000, the first plaintiffs had procured a performance bond in the sum\n\nof $1,009,000.00. The amount was meant to be 10% of the original contract sum of\n\n$10,090,000.00 as spelt out in the guarantee. Subsequently, the Architects revised the\n\ncontract sum to $7,995,000.00 following a request by Lau. The first plaintiffs\n\nconsequently contended that, given the reduction in the contract sum, the guarantee sum\n\nmust likewise be reduced to $799,500 (i.e. 10% of $7,995,000). However, Hola argued that\n\nthe parties had not contemplated the revision of the performance bond; in support of this\n\nargument, Hola referred to Goh's evidence under cross-examination (at N/E 5):Q: Did you ask architects or first defendants for a\n\n    reduction?A: No.61.        However, it would appear\n\nclear from case-law that the claim for payment under the performance bond should be\n\nconfined to 10% of the revised contract sum, and not 10% of the original contract sum, as\n\nargued by Hola. The Court of Appeal's decision inGHL Pte Ltd v Unitrack Building\n\nConstruction Pte Ltd[1999] 4 SLR 604is instructive in this regard. The case\n\nestablished that where the original contract sum has been revised downwards, the sum\n\npayable under the performance bond should be based on the revised sum. It was further\n\ndeemed unconscionable for the holder of the performance bond to demand payment based on\n\nthe original contract sum.62.        I accept that the\n\nrevision of about 20% of the original contract sum in the present case is much lower than\n\nthe 65% revision inGHL. Even so, the principle established inGHLis clear.\n\nThe revision of the contract sum represents a reduction of the contractor’s\n\nresponsibility towards the developer. Under such circumstances, the security held by the\n\ndeveloper in the form of a performance bond must similarly be reduced. As was noted by\n\nThean JA (at p 617 of the case):As between GHL and Unitrack, the latter’s\n\n    commitment under the contract was considerably reduced and similarly the security for such\n\n    commitment would, in normal cases, be correspondingly reduced.63.        The Court of Appeal inDauphin\n\nOffshore Engineering & Trading Pte Ltd v The Private Office of HRH Sheikh Sultan bin\n\nKhalifa[2000] 1 SLR 657did not think it possible to define, in precise terms, what\n\nconstitutesunconscionabilityand stated at para 42 (p 668):…What kind of situation would constitute unconscionability would\n\n    have to depend on the facts of each case…There is no pre-determined categorisation.64.        In the present case, the\n\ncontract sum was revised from $10,090,000.00 to $7,995,000.00. As such, the amount payable\n\nunder the performance bond should be 10% of the revised contract sum, namely $799,500.00.\n\nIt would therefore be unconscionable of Hola to call on the performance bond in the sum of\n\n$1,090,000.00.65.        Hola had argued that theGHLcase may be distinguished as Hola and the first plaintiffs, unlike the parties inGHL,\n\ndid not contemplate a revision of the performance bond. This is a misreading of theGHLcase. The parties inGHLsimilarly did not contemplate an express revision of\n\nthe performance bond; what they had contemplated was a revision of the original contract\n\nsum.66.        More importantly, the\n\nfact that the parties did not contemplate a revision of the performance bond does not\n\nplace that sum beyond revision. In fact, the converse appears to be the case: the sum\n\npayable under the performance bond is subject to revisionunlessthe parties have\n\nagreed that that amount is to be unaffected by any changes to the original contract sum.\n\nThis can be seen at para 28 ofGHL(at p 617), where the Court of Appeal stated:GHL had not adduced any evidence to the effect that it\n\n    was agreed that, notwithstanding the revision of the contract sum, the amount of\n\n    performance bond would continue to be 10% of the original contract sum. It seems to us\n\n    that in all probabilities after the revision of the contract on 30 April 1999 the parties\n\n    contemplated that the amount of the bond would be correspondingly revised downwards to 10%\n\n    of the revised contract sum…67.        I therefore find that\n\nHola are only entitled to call on and demand payment on the performance bond in the sum of\n\n$799,500.00, based on 10% of the revised contract sum; it was unconscionable of them to\n\nclaim $1,009,000.00.",
        "Dispute over the number of piles": "68.        There only remains one\n\nminor issue to be addressed, relating to the number of piles in respect of which the first\n\nplaintiffs were willing to accept liability. The first plaintiffs had accepted that they\n\nare liable for the damaged piles and for the rectification of 158 piles. That must mean\n\nthat the first plaintiffs admitted liability in respect of the original 32 piles that were\n\ndamaged as well as the piles in grid 7/A. However, Hola had argued that in addition to\n\nthese 158 piles, the first plaintiffs were also liable for the piles subsequently\n\ndiscovered to be damaged in grids 8/B and 6/A.69.        In a quotation dated 23\n\nJuly 2001 from Hock Ann Piling Pte Ltd to the first plaintiffs (see exhibit\n\n‘GKH-19’ in Goh's affidavit), it was stated that:...the nos. of RC Pile to be driven are 173 nos. as per\n\n    the above mentioned drawing. Deducting pile cap 7/A for 20 nos. of RC piles already driven\n\n    on 19 January 2001, the balance of RC pile will be driven will be 153 nos.70.        At trial, the structural\n\nengineerwas cross-examined on this quotation (N/E 130-131):Q: See GKH-19 p145 of PW1’s EIC. You said to your\n\n    counsel 187 compensating piles were required. Explain?A: 153+20+5 RC piles, so total is 178 not 187. Piles driven for 7/A\n\n    were 20 in number and again found to be damaged, so 5 more had to be added.Q: If this is the case, 173 were original number of compensation piles\n\n    but 5 more added. But 20 had been driven so balance is 153?A: Yes.Q: So total number of compensating piles should be 153+5 = 158?A: Yes71.        It is clear that the\n\nstructural engineer’s above testimony was in relation to exhibit 'GKH-19' only, which\n\nin turn relates to the 32 piles initially reported as damaged, as well as the piles in\n\ngrid 7/A. The exhibit was prepared before Hola discovered that the piles in grids 8/B and\n\n6/A were damaged. Consequently, I find that the first plaintiffs are also liable for the\n\npiles in grids 8/B and 6/A. I accept the structural engineer’s testimony that those\n\npiles were defective, but that the defects were not discovered until much later, due to\n\nthe first plaintiffs' submission of inaccurate pile eccentricities plan to the structural\n\nengineer. Specifically, the structural engineer had deposed (in para 32 of his affidavit):Union Contractors Pte Ltd (\"Union\n\n    Contractors\") who were the new contractor engaged to replace Hiap Tian Soon,\n\n    subsequently discovered that in fact certain piles at Grid 7/A as well as Grid 8/B and\n\n    Grid 6/A were defective. What was particularly disturbing to me was that in respect of\n\n    Grid 8/B and Grid 6/A, Hiap Tian Soon had submitted inaccurate pile eccentricities plan to\n\n    ASE Designtec showing that the pile eccentricities were within acceptable tolerance of\n\n    75mm when in actual fact the actual pile eccentricity had exceeded the tolerance of\n\n    75mm… Fortunately for Hola, these defects were noted by Union Contractors.........72.        It was clear that the\n\nfirst plaintiffs generally conceded liability on the damaged piles. Hence, they are liable\n\nnot just for the 158 piles, but also for the damaged piles in grids 8/B and 6/A.",
        "The decision": "73.        In conclusion, I award\n\ninterlocutory judgment with costs, to the first plaintiffs on their claim against Hola. I\n\nalso award interlocutory judgment with costs, on Hola’s counterclaim for the first\n\nplaintiffs' failure to rectify the defective works and for the delay in the works. The\n\nfirst plaintiffs' liability for non-rectification shall include the defective piles in\n\ngrids 8/B and 6/A, in addition to the 158 piles in respect of which they have conceded\n\nliability. Assessment of the first plaintiffs' claim and Hola's counterclaim shall be done\n\nby the Registrar and the costs of such assessment shall be reserved to the Registrar.\n\nUnless and until both claim and counterclaim have been assessed and quantified by the\n\nRegistrar and the figures set off to determine which party ultimately has to make payment,\n\nthe injunction against Hola restraining them from calling on the performance bond (which\n\ncan only be in the lesser amount of $799,500) will continue.74.        Finally, as a matter of\n\nprocedure, it was unnecessary for the second plaintiff to have been joined as a party to\n\nthese proceedings merely because he was the guarantor of the performance bond issued on\n\nthe first plaintiffs' behalf by Lonpac Insurance Bhd.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
