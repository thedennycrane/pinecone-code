        "FOTL": "5 FOTL was a major DyStar customer in Morocco. DyStar supplied it with Remazol Black B 50%, a liquid reactive dye (and other dyes, but it claimed only in respect of that dye). Kiri’s approaches to FOTL did not result in any sales of its dyes, but DyStar claimed damages on the basis that it had to lower its prices for Remazol Black B 50% in order that it not lose the business to Kiri.",
        "Kiri’s breaches": "67 The evidence of Kiri’s approaches was scant. In early March 2012, Brandix told Mr de Silva that Kiri was soliciting Brandix’s purchase of reactive dyes. It said that Kiri was marketing its dyes as comparable to DyStar’s Remazol dyes, but at substantially lower prices. At the end of 2012, Brandix told Mr de Silva that Kiri was showing it photos of Kirazol and Remazol products coming from the same production line, understood to be an assurance of the quality of the Kiri dyes.",
        "DyStar’s pricing": "68 In September 2013, Mr de Silva told Brandix that the prices of three Remazol RGB dyes, Remazol Navy Blue GG 133%, Remazol Navy RGB 150% and Remazol Ultra Red RGB, would have to be increased. As reported by him to DyStar, he was told by Brandix “that very likely Remazol RGB types will be replaced by Kiri as they have got 1:1 replacement at lower prices”. When reporting this, Mr de Silva told DyStar that he thought there was “no other choice but to go ahead with this price increase”. But when he met Brandix shortly thereafter, he agreed that the prices would not be increased, in order not to lose the business. What passed between Brandix and Mr de Silva at this meeting was not disclosed, other than that Mr de Silva “tried to adjust it with some others and we tried to make it a package offer” in order to keep the business. 69 The intended increases were 10% for Remazol Navy RGB GG 133%, 15% for Remazol Navy RGB 150% and 6% for Remazol Ultra Red RGB, to US$11.25, 7.60 and US$8.37 per kg respectively. 70 There was even less detail of subsequent pressure to maintain prices. The evidence included a November 2014 DyStar internal email saying that “Kiri promote very aggressive their Remazol RGB copy products to Brandix [sic]”, but there was no more specific evidence of price negotiations, or of Brandix using Kiri’s promotion of its products as a lever to maintain prices. 71 In fact, there were subsequent price increases. Mr de Silva’s attention was drawn to an invoice in December 2014 for Remazol Navy RGB 150% at US$9.95 per kg and Remazol Ultra Red at US$10 per kg. He said in his oral evidence that there had been large raw material cost increases, and that the price increases were: “…the bare minimum because always it was a struggle to get the prices to the level that we wanted. They may have increased, but this is not where we wanted to be.” 72 Mr de Silva said that while there had been discussions with Brandix in 2014 about increasing prices, he could not recall the prices he wanted, but “we just got the bare minimum”. He said that he was able to retain the Brandix business because of a strong relationship with Brandix and its desire for DyStar’s high quality dyes, and that he believed DyStar would have been able to increase the prices of the Remazol dyes sold to Brandix from 2014 to 2016 by 10% to 15%. That statement of belief was linked to, and appeared to be because of, the same belief stated by Eric in his AEIC. Eric supported his belief by reference to the average selling prices of five Remazol dyes to South Asian customers in 2014. The prices were, on average over the five dyes, 19% higher than the prices to Brandix.",
        "Discussion": "73 There was some lack of congruence in DyStar’s case. The evidence was of inability to increase the prices of the three dyes, Remazol Navy Blue GG 133%, Remazol Navy RGB 150% and Remazol Ultra Red RGB. The inability was founded on the September 2013 exchange with Brandix (see [68] above), with a dearth of specific evidence thereafter of pushback by Brandix as to these dyes or any dyes at all. But DyStar’s calculation of its loss assumed inability to raise the prices of a range of Remazol dyes – Remazol RGB, Remazol Other Colours and Remazol Black – on assumed price rises of 10% to 15% across all the dyes for 2014 to 2016. Eric’s support for the price rise was founded neither on prices to other customers for the three dyes nor on prices for the entire range of dyes. He took five dyes, which included only one of the three dyes. DyStar’s claim to damages is not assisted by these variations. 74 Kiri again submitted that DyStar had failed to establish a causal link between its breaches and any loss from failure to increase prices. It said that, because of the strong relationship and desire for DyStar’s quality dyes to which Mr de Silva referred, Brandix would not have abandoned DyStar if DyStar had insisted on price increases, and placed some weight on the fact that Brandix had only entered into nine transactions with Kiri for a small quantity of dyes. It said also that DyStar’s sales of Remazol RGB dyes to Brandix were declining from 2015, due to Brandix’s financial difficulties, and suggested that in any event, DyStar would have maintained or even lowered its prices in order to keep Brandix’s business. 75 The first part of the submission, as with FOTL, is not to the point. In our view, it is clear that Kiri’s breaches gave Brandix a lever to bring DyStar to forego its intended price increases in September 2013. So far as the evidence showed, Brandix was not yet then in the financial difficulties which caused it to cease business in 2017, and we consider that but for Kiri’s breaches, DyStar would have obtained the intended price increases for the three dyes. 76 Beyond that, the evidence is far from specific, and there is much uncertainty. It is likely that there was subsequent pushback from Brandix to DyStar, with reference to replacement by Kiri’s products – unlike in respect of FOTL, Kiri was in fact dealing with Brandix, and the aggressive promotion suggested in the November 2014 email is likely to have been correct. It is likely also that, although Brandix’s pushback to Mr de Silva in December 2013 was as to “Remazol RGB types” and then only in relation to the three dyes, Mr de Silva felt constrained after September 2013 in insisting on price rises for Remazol dyes more generally. The dyes involved, however, are unclear. 77 But the constraint was not complete. There were price increases, and although Mr de Silva said he got the bare minimum, so far as the evidence went the bare minimum may have been more than the underlying cost increases. Even then, Mr de Silva’s evidence did not directly attribute inability to get more than the bare minimum, over the whole of the next three years, to fear of losing Brandix to Kiri. DyStar’s sales of Remazol dyes to Brandix decreased in 2013, recovered in part in 2014, and fell to almost nothing over 2015 to 2018; as Brandix encountered its ultimately terminal financial difficulties, it may be thought unlikely that DyStar would have been able to insist on price rises, quite apart from Kiri’s presence in the market, particularly when Jay Chemicals was an alternative supplier. 78 A loss was suffered, and we should do our best to arrive at damages, even if with estimation. While DyStar must prove its loss, the certainty of proof required depends on the circumstances and the nature of the loss, and if it is of a kind difficult to ascertain with certainty and precise evidence is not available, the Court must do the best it can on the available evidence: seeRobertson Quay Investment Pte Ltd v Steen Consultants Pte Ltdand another[2008] 2 SLR(R) 623 at [27]-[28]. 79 There was an immediate inability to raise the prices of the three dyes. It is not clear that Brandix’s push-back went beyond Remazol RGB dyes, that Kiri’s competition was a complete restraint thereafter, or that DyStar would otherwise have been able to get price rises in and after 2015. Balancing these uncertainties, in our view a fair estimation is that DyStar would otherwise have been able to increase its prices by 10% for Remazol RGB dyes for deliveries in 2014. Quantum 80 DyStar’s calculation of damages, with which Kiri again did not take issue, took margins which would have been earned for each category of Remazol dyes from 2014 to 2016 if prices had been 10% or 15% higher, less the margins actually earned. The figure for Remazol RGB dyes for 2014 at a 10% increase should be extracted or recalculated.",
        "Hayleys": "42 Hayleys was a DyStar customer in Sri Lanka, to which DyStar supplied a variety of its Remazol reactive dyes. 43 In contrast to FOTL, Kiri supplied considerable quantities of dyes to Hayleys. DyStar claimed damages on the basis that it lost sales to Kiri which DyStar would otherwise have made to Hayleys.",
        "DyStar’s sales": "47 Table B below sets out DyStar’s sales to Hayleys for its corresponding Remazol reactive dyes, including over the prior period. TABLE B DyStar’s sale of Remazol to HayleysYearRemazol RGB (kg)Remazol Other Colours (kg)Remazol Black (kg)Total (kg)200715,2754,50075,95095,725200821,3253,05061,50085,875200918,3506,77523,60048,725201020,8001,5005,00027,30020116,5251,74011,00019,26520124,4003,4006,35014,1502013501,225501,3252014----2015-50-50201675100-175201714,575850-15,425201816,7751,025-17,800 48 DyStar submitted that the Tables showed the “devastating” effect of Kiri’s breaches on DyStar’s sales of Remazol dyes to Hayleys. DyStar did not say that it would have made all the sales made by Kiri. Its sales to Hayleys had fallen significantly from 2007 to 2011, prior to Kiri’s intervention. DyStar attributed this to the 2008 to 2009 Global Financial Crisis and its own insolvency in 2009 (see the Judgment at [11]-[13]), and to the effect on Hayleys of an internal fraud in 2011 which caused it to cut costs in 2011 and 2012, including reducing its purchase of reactive dyes. DyStar said that but for Kiri’s breaches in 2012, it would have achieved at least its 2009 level of sales to Hayleys in 2012 to 2018, if not 10% to 20% more.",
        "Brandix": "66 Brandix was also a DyStar customer in Sri Lanka. DyStar supplied it with Remazol RGB dyes. Over the period 2014 to 2016, Kiri supplied a small quantity of dyes to Brandix in nine transactions, but DyStar did not claim damages in relation to those sales. It claimed damages on the basis that it was unable to increase its prices of Remazol RGB dyes, lest it lose the business to Kiri. In other words, unlike the claim as regards Hayleys, the claim here was not that DyStar would have otherwise made sales if not for Kiri’s sales to Brandix. It was instead similar in tenor to the claim as regards FOTL.",
        "Orders": "81 Final orders cannot now be made. We direct that within 21 days the parties provide to the Registry an agreed statement of the damages calculated in conformity with these reasons, including interest to date and a daily rate of interest. Orders will then be made. 82 We also direct that within 21 days the parties exchange written submissions on costs. Unless the Court requires (or one of the parties requests) an oral hearing as to costs, the Court will determine costs based on the parties’ written submissions alone.
