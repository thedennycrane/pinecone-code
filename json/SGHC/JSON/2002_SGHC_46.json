        "The facts": "2 The facts relevant to this appeal were not in dispute. On 16 January\n\n2001, officers from the Ministry of Manpower conducted a raid at a food court outlet at\n\nCauseway Point, which was allegedly owned by a company known as The Chef's Sam Pte Ltd\n\n(\"Chef's Sam\"). Four workers were seen within the stall, one of whom was Kuan, a\n\nMalaysian. It was later revealed that Kuan was under the employ of Forward Food, having\n\nbeen recruited by Tan, who was a director of that company. In addition to supervising the\n\nworkers at the various outlets which Forward Food managed, Kuan’s job also entailed\n\nchecking stocks at these outlets. Upon ascertaining the supply requirements of these\n\noutlets, Kuan would then make arrangements for the delivery of the necessary supplies.3 Under Kuan's work permit, her occupation was described as a\n\n\"Waiter Supervisor/Waitress Supervisor\" and this was also reflected in the\n\napplication form for her work permit, which was signed by Tan on behalf of Forward Food.\n\nOn the same form, Forward Food was described as Kuan's employer.",
        "The trial": "4 In the court below, the prosecution's case was simply that the work\n\npermit had been issued to Forward Food under two conditions and that these had been\n\nbreached by the appellants. The first condition was that Kuan had to be employed by\n\nForward Food and the second condition was that she had to be employed as a\n\n\"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". With regard to the first condition, the\n\nprosecution alleged that the food court outlets where Kuan worked belonged to Chef's Sam\n\nand Kuan was under Chef’s Sam’s employ. This assertion was rejected by the trial\n\njudge, who was not satisfied that there was any evidence that Kuan was not in fact\n\nemployed by Forward Food. Instead, he found that there was evidence which went to show\n\nthat the said food court outlets were in fact licensed to Tan and that Forward Food had\n\nbeen appointed to manage these outlets. As such, it could not be said that that condition\n\nhad been breached.5 However, the trial judge agreed with the prosecution that Kuan was\n\nnot employed as a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\" as stipulated in the work permit.\n\nInstead, he felt that she was more of a stall supervisor, highlighting that as Tan had\n\nconceded in his evidence that there were no waiters or waitresses at the food court\n\noutlets, Kuan could not have been working as a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\".\n\nComing to this conclusion, the district judge amended the charge by deleting the reference\n\nto Chef's Sam and convicted the appellants on the amended charges. He then sentenced the\n\nappellants to a fine of $2,500 each as this was the usual tariff fine for such an offence.6 In addition to the foregoing, four other points of evidence, which\n\nwere not apparent from the district judge’s judgment, caught my attention. First, the\n\nprosecution’s witness from the Ministry of Manpower, investigating officer Mr Ng Ngak\n\nShim (\"IO Ng\"), did not seem very certain as to whether Kuan’s duties were\n\noutside the scope of a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". Second, it was IO Ng’s\n\nevidence that the Ministry did not have any defined job scope in relation to a\n\n\"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". The third point pertained to the application\n\nprocess for Kuan’s work permit. At the trial, Tan testified that, when he was\n\ncompleting the application form for the permit, he noticed that there was no relevant\n\ncategory listed in the form other than \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". There was\n\ncertainly no \"Stall Supervisor\" category and, as such, he chose the former\n\ncategory. Moreover, after making the application for Kuan, he was not told of the limited\n\nscope of work that Kuan, as a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\", would be allowed to\n\ndo. The fourth point was that it was apparent from the notes of evidence that the\n\nprosecution’s main line of attack in the court below was that Kuan was actually not\n\nin the employ of Forward Food. This was rejected by the district judge, who proceeded to\n\nconvict the appellants on what was clearly a collateral and technical ground.",
        "The appeal": "7 Before me, the appellants advanced several arguments which went to\n\nchallenging the trial judge's finding that, based on the job which Kuan was employed to\n\ndo, the appellants were in breach of the work permit condition that Kuan be only employed\n\nas a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\".8 First, the appellants argued that the trial judge erred in failing to\n\nconsider that the prosecution had not produced any evidence to show that there was a\n\nspecific job description known as a \"Stall Supervisor\" for which a work permit\n\ncould have been applied for and the scope of duties of such a job description, if it\n\nexisted. Second, the appellants contended that it could well be that a \"Stall\n\nSupervisor\" had the same duties as a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor \"and, as\n\nthe prosecution did not lead any evidence as to what the duties of a \"Waiter/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\" were, they argued that the prosecution had not proven its case beyond\n\nreasonable doubt.9 The appellants' third submission was that the trial judge erred in\n\nnot considering the evidence of IO Ng, who gave some evidence of what he perceived to be\n\nthe scope of duties of a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". During cross-examination,\n\nIO Ng stated that there was no job scope set out by the Ministry of Manpower in relation\n\nto a waiter supervisor. Significantly, he also conceded that if Kuan simply checked the\n\nstocks of her official employer, served customers at its outlets and supervised its\n\nemployees working there, there would have been no breach of the work permit conditions.\n\nThe appellants argued that this evidence clearly showed that the duties carried out by\n\nKuan were within the job scope permitted by the Ministry of Manpower.10 The appellants then argued that the district judge erred in failing\n\nto consider Tan's evidence that he was given no information as to the scope of work Kuan\n\nwas allowed to do. The prosecution responded by saying that in the court below there was a\n\nform, signed by Tan, which stated the conditions of the work permit. But as the\n\nprosecution did not produce this form, the appellants submitted that an adverse inference\n\nshould have been drawn against the prosecution in this respect. Through this argument, the\n\nappellants contended that no conditions were attached to their employment of Kuan and\n\nthere could therefore have been no breach of such conditions.11 Finally, the appellants asserted that the trial judge erred in\n\nfinding that there were no waiters or waitresses at the food outlets because he drew this\n\nconclusion from Tan's evidence. They contended that it was clear from Tan’s evidence\n\nthat he was confused over the use of the words ‘waiter’ and ‘waitress’\n\nand the trial judge should not have placed too much weight on his evidence with regard to\n\nthis point.12 The prosecution's main response to the appellants' arguments was\n\nthat Tan himself had admitted that there were no waiters or waitresses working at the food\n\ncourt outlets. Therefore the trial judge was right to come to the conclusion that it could\n\nnot be said that Kuan was employed to supervise waiters or waitresses there. In addition\n\nto this argument, the prosecution claimed that the trial judge was correct not to draw an\n\nadverse inference against the prosecution for failing to produce the form containing the\n\nconditions of the work permit. In support of this submission, the prosecution citedYeo\n\nChoon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217for the proposition that an adverse inference could\n\nonly be drawn against it, under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act, if it had\n\nwithheld or suppressed the evidence. As it did not withhold any evidence which was in its\n\npossession, the prosecution contended that an adverse inference should not be drawn\n\nagainst it.13 As can be seen from the above arguments, the parties only addressed\n\nmyself and the district court on issues pertaining to the actus reus of the offence. No\n\nevidence relating to the appellants’ mens rea was adduced and there were no\n\nsubmissions as to whether this offence was a strict liability offence. After reading the\n\nrelevant provision, I had doubts as to whether the presumption of mens rea, as stated by\n\nthe Privy Council inLim Chin Aik v The Queen[1963] AC 160, had been rebutted and\n\nthat the offence is necessarily a strict liability offence. However, as I came to the\n\nconclusion that the actus reus of the offence had not been made out and also I did not\n\nreceive full arguments on the issue of mens rea, I considered it neither necessary nor\n\nappropriate to deal with this issue in the present case.",
        "The issues": "14 Considering the arguments raised by the parties, three issues had to\n\nbe resolved in order for this appeal to be disposed of. First, there was the question of\n\nwhether there were any conditions attached to the issuance of Kuan’s work permit for\n\nher employment under Forward Food and, if so, whether one of these conditions was that\n\nForward Food was only entitled to employ Kuan in the capacity of a \"Waiter/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\". Second, if the answer to the first question was in the affirmative,\n\nthere was the issue of what scope of duties the occupation of \"Waiter/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\" entailed. Finally, there had to be a determination of whether Kuan's\n\nduties fell under the scope of duties of a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\". If the\n\nanswer to this last question was in the affirmative, the appellants were not guilty of the\n\noffence for which they had been charged.15 As stated above, one of the appellants’ arguments before me was\n\nthat no conditions were attached to Kuan’s work permit. While it is true that the\n\nprosecution did not produce any document which precisely stated the scope of duties which\n\nKuan could engage in, Tan did sign the application form for Kuan’s work permit. In\n\nthat form, Kuan’s occupation was stated as \"Waiter Supervisor/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\". Under the section on employer’s particulars, Forward Food was\n\nstated as Kuan’s employer and its primary activity was listed as\n\n\"Restaurant/Restaurants-cum-nightclubs\". It was implicit that two conditions\n\nwere attached to Kuan’s work permit. First, Forward Food was to be Kuan’s\n\nemployer and second, she was to be employed in the capacity of a \"Waiter/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\" in its restaurant business. Approval for the work permit was obtained on\n\nthis basis and I found the appellants’ argument that there were no conditions\n\nattached to the work permit to be without merit.16 I now turn to the issue of the scope of duties of a\n\n\"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\" and whether Kuan acted in this capacity at her job.\n\nIn this regard, I must confess that I felt some sympathy for the appellants. This was a\n\nfar cry from the usual case where employers were caught hiring a foreigner with an invalid\n\nwork permit, or where the work permit was flagrantly and unequivocally breached in the\n\nsense that the foreigner was employed for a job that was not in any way related to the\n\noccupation stipulated in his work permit. In this case, the appellants applied for a valid\n\nwork permit for Kuan. As Tan testified, there was no category labelled \"Stall\n\nSupervisor\" listed in the work permit application form or he would have chosen that\n\ncategory. Faced with this situation, Tan chose the category which he thought was the most\n\nrelevant, i.e. \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\".17 Ultimately, this appeal turned on the issue of whether Forward\n\nFood’s staff at its food outlets could properly be termed 'waiters'. The appellants\n\nargued that a broader definition of 'waiter' should be adopted to include people who serve\n\nfood at counters in a food court. If this was accepted, there would have been nothing\n\nobjectionable about the appellants’ deployment of Kuan to supervise Forward\n\nFood’s staff at its food outlets. On the other hand, if, as the prosecution argued,\n\nthe word 'waiter' should be given its ordinary meaning, i.e. a person who waits on\n\ncustomers at a restaurant or caf and serves food to its customers, then there was a\n\nbreach of the work permit conditions.",
        "The strict construction rule": "18 Counsel for the appellants argued that the word ‘waiter’\n\nwas ambiguous and ought to be construed in the appellants’ favour. While no authority\n\nwas cited for this proposition, he obviously referred to the rule of statutory\n\nconstruction which provides that penal statutes should be strictly construed in favour of\n\naccused persons. As I shall discuss below, this rule has been the subject of great\n\ncriticism and is no longer an absolute rule. However, before dealing with the application\n\nof that rule, there was of course the question of whether it was proper to apply the rule\n\nto the construction of a document which was obviously not legislative in nature. Applying\n\na common sense approach to this question, I did not see why a court should not apply a\n\nrule of statutory construction, providing for a construction in favour of accused persons,\n\nto executive orders and conditions. One would expect the quality of drafting to be poorer\n\nin the cases of executive orders and conditions as compared to normal legislation. If so,\n\nshould not an accused be afforded the same, if not better, treatment when a court\n\nconstrued such documents, which could result in penal sanction stipulated in a parent\n\nstatute?19 Having established that the rule could be applied, I then considered\n\nwhether I should nevertheless refuse to apply it in the present case. This was because\n\nthere exists a considerable body of learned opinion which believes that the rule should\n\nnot be applied as strictly and absolutely as it has been in the past. I further noted that\n\nthis rule is so controversial that, when commentators suggested adding it to the English\n\nLaw Commission’s draft criminal code for England, the Commission openly declared in\n\nits report,Criminal Law: A Criminal Code for England and Wales(Law Com no. 177,\n\n1989) at para 3.17, that it was..… sceptical whether such a principle really exists. It is of\n\n  course often referred to by the courts, but it is rarely applied in practice. This is\n\n  because the \"principle\" cannot sensibly be used as a rule for the resolution of\n\n  all ambiguities. We do not think it would be acceptable for the Code to provide in effect\n\n  that whether some arguable point of doubt arose about the interpretation of an offence the\n\n  point should automatically be resolved in favour of the accused.20 I was not surprised by the English Law Commission’s reaction to\n\nthe rule as the English courts have defined and applied it very liberally from the onset\n\nof its development. The passage most often quoted on this rule is taken from Lord\n\nEsher’s judgment inTuck & Sons v Priester(1887) 19 QBD 629 at 638, where\n\nhe stated that:If there is a reasonable interpretation which will avoid the penalty in\n\n  any particular case, we must adopt that construction. If there are two reasonable\n\n  constructions we must give the more lenient one. That is the settled rule for construction\n\n  of penal sections.The rule, as expressed in the above passage, is unreasonably absolute\n\nand has therefore been criticised by many academics and judges. In fact, many courts have\n\nrefused to apply the rule as it is stated above, adopting purposive, wider interpretations\n\nof penal statutes in the cases before them, even when these interpretations were\n\ndetrimental to accused persons; see for exampleSmiths v Hughes[1960] 2 All ER\n\n859;A-G’s Reference (No. 1 of 1988)[1989] AC 971 andR v Par[1987] 2 SCR 618.21 To my mind, it was therefore important to consider the theoretical\n\nbasis of the rule and its applicability in the modern legal environment, where courts are\n\nmore disposed to applying the purposive approach to statutory interpretation. The origins\n\nof the strict construction rule can be found in capital cases where the courts construed\n\nambiguous statutory provisionsin favorem vitaeas this was regarded as a form of\n\nfairness to the individual. According to Professor Andrew Ashworth, \"Interpreting\n\nCriminal Statutes: A Crisis of Legality?\" (1991) LQR 419 at 432, the principle was\n\nsubsequently carried over into other areas of criminal law, probably because criminal\n\nproceedings were viewed as an unequal contest between the individual and the State. This\n\nseems to be supported by the dicta of Wilson J inR v Par(1987) 60 CR (3d) 346\n\nat 368. Furthermore, the editors ofCross on Statutory Interpretation(3rded.) opined, at 173, that the application of this rule in earlier cases likeR v Harris(1836) 7 C & P 446 was justified on humanitarian grounds because of the manifest\n\ninjustice brought about by other interpretations of a statute. These, however, have been\n\nrendered unnecessary by the mitigation of the rigours of the criminal law. Moreover,\n\ncourts have increasingly taken the view that an extreme slant in favour of the accused is\n\nnot always desirable because it often defeats the purposes of the legislation and this in\n\nturn leads to some other form of injustice.22 Having said the above, this does not mean that the rule has been, or\n\nshould be, abolished. On the contrary, the rule has been affirmed, albeit in a modified\n\nmanner, by many courts across the Commonwealth over the past few decades; see for exampleSweet\n\nv Parsley[1970] AC 132 at 165;DPP v Ottewell[1970] AC 642 at 649;R v\n\nGreen[1992] 1 SCR 614;Beckwith v R(1976) 12 ALR 333 andDeming No 456 Pty\n\nLtd v Brisbane Unit Development Corp Pty Ltd(1983) ALR 1 at 15. The Singapore courts\n\nhave also applied the rule on a number of occasions; see for exampleRe Sim Khoon\n\nSeng’s Application[1963] 1 MLJ 9andTeng Lang Khin v PP[1995] 1 SLR 372. More recently, I referred to the rule in two cases,Choy Tuck Sum v PP[2000] 4 SLR 665andPP v Tsao Kok Wah[2001] 1 SLR 666, although I felt that it was not\n\napplicable in those cases.23 I did not apply the strict construction rule inChoy Tuck Sum v\n\nPPandPP v Tsao Kok Wahas there was no ambiguity in the provisions that were\n\nbeing construed in those two cases. In such a situation, the rule would not be applicable\n\nand this position was supported by the various authorities which I have cited above. There\n\nis, in any event, another qualification which significantly narrows the application of\n\nthis rule. As stated by Professor Glanville Williams, \"Statute Interpretation,\n\nprostitution and the rule of law\" in C.F.H. Tapper,Crime, Proof and Punishment:\n\nEssays in Memory of Sir Rupert Crossat 72,Nowadays the criminal courts rarely apply the rule of strict\n\n  construction. They will still apply it if they are in genuine doubt as to the intention of\n\n  the legislature and if there are no considerations indicating the desirability of a wide\n\n  interpretation of the statute. But if the statute admits of alternative interpretations\n\n  and public policy suggests that the wider interpretation should be preferred, the courts\n\n  will usually apply the wider one.The cases lend support to this view. In the English case ofDPP v\n\nOttewellat 649, Lord Reid stated:The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) refer to the well established\n\n  principle that in doubtful cases a penal provision ought to be given that interpretation\n\n  which is least unfavourable to the accused. I would never seek to diminish in any way the\n\n  importance of that principle within its proper sphere. But it only applies where after\n\n  full inquiry and consideration one is left in real doubt.The House of Lords then adopted a purposive interpretation of the\n\nrelevant provision, taking the view that the strict construction rule was not a rule for\n\nthe resolution of all ambiguities. This also seems to have been the position taken by Lord\n\nParker inBowers v Gloucester Corporation[1963] 1 QB 881.24 The Australian courts have come to the similar conclusion that in\n\nconstruing penal statutes, Parliament's intent is important and its commands should not be\n\nweakened by an unduly open-handed approach to statutory interpretation: seeScott v\n\nCawsey(1907) 5 CLR 132 at 154-5. InBeckwith v Rat p 339, Gibbs J stated\n\nthat:[t]he rule formerly accepted, that statutes creating offences are to be\n\n  strictly construed, has lost much of its importance in modern times. In determining the\n\n  meaning of a penal statute the ordinary rules of construction must be applied, but if the\n\n  language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful the ambiguity or doubt may be\n\n  resolved in favour of the subject by refusing to extend the category of criminal offences;\n\n  seeR v Adams(1935) 53 CLR 563 at 567-8;Craies on Statute Law7thed, pp 529-34.The rule is perhaps one of last resort. [emphasis added]25 As for the Canadian position, Cory J held, inR v Hasselwander[1993] 2 SCR 398 at 413, that:… the rule of strict construction becomes applicable only when\n\n  attempts at the neutral interpretation suggested by s.12 of the Interpretation Act still\n\n  leaves reasonable doubt as to the meaning or scope of the text of the statute. As\n\n  Professor Ct has pointed out, this means that even with penal statutes, the real\n\n  intention of the legislature must be sought, and the meaning compatible with its goals\n\n  applied.26 As the above passages show, the strict construction rule is only\n\napplied to ambiguous statutory provisions as a tool of last resort. The proper approach to\n\nbe taken by a court construing a penal provision is to first consider if the literal and\n\npurposive interpretations of the provision leave the provision in ambiguity. It is only\n\nafter these and other tools of ascertaining Parliament's intent have been exhausted, that\n\nthe strict construction rule kicks in in the accused person's favour.",
        "Construction of the condition": "27 Having determined the approach to be applied, I then considered the\n\nproper construction of the condition attached to Kuan's work permit. The first issue that\n\nhad to be resolved was whether the use of the term 'waiter' in the condition was\n\nunequivocal. The obvious purpose of s 5(3) of the Employment of Foreign Workers Act is to\n\nensure that the Ministry of Manpower is able to effectively regulate and monitor foreign\n\nemployees. By laying down conditions to an employee's work permit, the Ministry would be\n\nable to monitor the places where they work as well as regulate the type of jobs which they\n\ndo according to its prevailing policies. However, no meaningful interpretation of the\n\ncondition could be made with this purpose in mind, since it was the manifestation of this\n\npolicy which was the subject of construction and no evidence was led by the prosecution as\n\nto the Ministry's policy vis--vis \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisors\". That it was\n\nwilling to grant work permits to foreigners for this job was clear since this was stated\n\non its application form and such a work permit was in fact granted to Kuan. What was\n\nequivocal was the scope of duties of a \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\" and this, as\n\nI pointed out above, turned on the meaning of 'waiter'.28 My first impression of the term ‘waiter’ was that its\n\nmeaning was clear and that the actus reus of the offence had been made out. After all,\n\n'waiters', as defined by most dictionaries, are people who wait on customers at a\n\nrestaurant or cafes. However, the notes of evidence revealed that there is confusion\n\namongst a segment of our population, and even in the Ministry of Manpower, as to its\n\ndefinition. Tan was obviously confused. And, as I have stated above, so was IO Ng. No\n\ndoubt there are people who understand waiters to be persons who simply serve food to\n\ncustomers, whether over a counter or in a restaurant. The fact that there are people who\n\nhold a slightly different view on the definition of a term would not normally mean that a\n\nterm is ambiguous in the sense that the strict construction rule should be applied.\n\nHowever, considering the special facts of this case, my view was that the term should be\n\nregarded as ambiguous.29 The dictionary meaning of the words is not always the most\n\nappropriate meaning to accord to a word in a statute. Often, the meaning which should be\n\naccorded is that which would be understood by the reasonable person. This proposition was\n\nstated by Lord Diplock inBlack-Clawson International Ltd v Papierwerke\n\nWaldhof-Aschaffenberg AG[1975] AC 591 at 638:The acceptance of the rule of law as a constitutional principle\n\n  requires that a citizen, before committing himself to any course of action, should be able\n\n  to know in advance what are the legal consequences that will flow from it. Where those\n\n  consequences are regulated by a statute the source of that knowledge is what the statute\n\n  says. In construing it the court must give effect to what the words of the statute would\n\n  be reasonably understood to mean by those whose conduct it regulates. That any or all of\n\n  the individual members of the two Houses of Parliament that passed it may have thought the\n\n  words bore a different meaning cannot affect the matter. Parliament, under our\n\n  constitution, is sovereign only in respect of what it expresses by the words used in the\n\n  legislation it has passed.In the present case, Tan, and no doubt a relatively significant\n\nproportion of our population, probably held the view that staff working at the counter of\n\na food court outlet fell under the definition of 'waiter'. That an officer from the\n\nMinistry of Manpower, tasked with the investigation of the contravention of such\n\nconditions, proved unsure about the meaning of the term did not bode well for the\n\nprosecution’s case since this made Tan’s understanding all the more reasonable.\n\nIt was unfair for the appellants to be convicted for the contravention of a condition,\n\nwhich the Ministry itself had no clear position on.30 Considering the ambiguity of the term ‘waiter’ and the\n\ninapplicability of the other instruments of statutory interpretation, it was my opinion\n\nthat the strict construction rule should be applied, and the ambiguity resolved in the\n\nappellants’ favour. However, even if I had come to a different conclusion, I would\n\nnevertheless have allowed the appeal because of the Ministry’s contribution to any\n\nmisunderstanding that the appellants may have had. The appellants’ understanding of\n\nthe term \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\", at least vis--vis the Ministry of\n\nManpower’s position, was to a certain extent shaped by the form provided by the\n\nMinistry. The form misled the appellants, albeit not intentionally, into thinking that\n\nthey fell within a category of applicants and they should accordingly not be faulted for\n\nsuch a belief. In this regard, I was mindful of Tan’s testimony that the application\n\nform did not contain a category titled \"Stall Supervisor\" and he therefore chose\n\n\"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\", that being the most similar or relevant category\n\ndescribing the job he wanted to employ Kuan for. Moreover he testified that after making\n\nthe application, he was not informed of the scope of duties a \"Waiter/Waitress\n\nSupervisor\" was allowed to do. Presumably there was no indication on the application\n\nform on this, nor was there a note instructing uncertain applicants to refer to a Ministry\n\nofficer to clarify if they were wrong to assume that they could then select the next most\n\nrelevant category. In addition to this, there was probably no \"others\" category\n\nwhich could have been selected and followed up by the Ministry. It was unfortunate that\n\nthe prosecution did not adduce a copy of the application form into evidence as this would\n\nhave clarified whatever doubts I had on it. But in the circumstances, I felt that the\n\nappellants should be given the benefit of the doubt on this issue.31 Considering the circumstances surrounding the work permit\n\napplication, it was to my mind not unreasonable for the appellants to have formed the view\n\nthat they could legitimately employ Kuan for the tasks of supervising counter staff at\n\ntheir food court outlets under the conditions laid down in her work permit. Tan’s\n\nselection of the \"Waiter/Waitress Supervisor\" category was similarly\n\nunimpeachable. This was because people, when completing forms, usually select categories\n\nwhich best describe them or the information which they want to give. This would occur,\n\neven if their circumstances did not fall exactly within the literal meaning of any\n\nparticular category. If the intention of the Ministry was to insist on exactitude, then it\n\nshould have provided definitions of the various words, included an \"others\"\n\ncategory or directed applicants to enquire with a Ministry officer if there was any doubt.\n\nEmployers should not be made to second guess the Ministry’s policies that are vaguely\n\nset out in its application form and be subsequently prosecuted for this.32 To summarise, I found that there was ambiguity in the term\n\n‘waiter’ which should be construed in the appellants’ favour under the\n\nstrict construction rule. The term ‘waiter’ should thus be taken to include\n\ncounter staff working at food court outlets. As Kuan’s tasks encompassed supervising\n\nsuch staff, the appellants had employed her in accordance with the conditions in her work\n\npermit. In addition to the above, I felt that it was unacceptable that the appellants\n\nshould stand convicted because, to a certain extent, the Ministry contributed to their\n\nconfusion. The Ministry was in a far superior position to procure accurate information.\n\nInstead, because of the miscommunication brought about by its application form, the\n\nappellants received what they reasonably perceived to be permission to employ Kuan as a\n\nstall supervisor. I would not go so far as to say that the Ministry’s form had to be\n\nperfectly defined since this would have cumbersome and onerous consequences on the\n\noperations of the government. However, as I have stated above, there are other means\n\nthrough which information can be solicited from, and given to, applicants, who may be\n\nuncertain as to the categories in a form when their circumstances do not readily fall\n\nwithin the strict confines of those categories. These methods of ensuring that there was\n\nno miscommunication between the ministry and the appellants were not present and it would\n\nbe unjust for them to be thus convicted.33 For the above reasons, I allowed the appellants’ appeals\n\nagainst their conviction.Appeal allowed.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
