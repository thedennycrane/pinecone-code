        "The first affidavit of Wong Ping Leung": "10.        The first affidavit of Mr\n\nWong Ping Leung, also known as Charles Wong, in support of Sinojaya’s contentions,\n\nstates inter alia:‘6.    This is especially so after\n\n  the Defendants have actually admitted to the liability as recorded in the minutes prepared\n\n  by their own managing director, Mr Chua Kheng Choon (\"CKC\") in relation to the\n\n  settlement meeting held at Hilton Hotel on 22.02.02 (refer to paragraph 11 of LSM’s\n\n  affidavit).7.    I was present at this meeting with\n\n  a colleague, Mr Lim Kwee Beng. The meeting was called by CKC and we were to attend the\n\n  meeting as the representatives of the Plaintiffs. I believe that none of the parties\n\n  informed their lawyers about this meeting even though the Plaintiffs have commenced\n\n  proceedings and the Defendants have entered appearance. CKC had reassured us that\n\n  everyone’s concern is primarily to settle this matter and not to protract it any\n\n  further. In fact CKC personally told me over the phone prior to the meeting that the\n\n  Defendants would pay us our claim while they would look to Hoyo for payment.8.    At this meeting which lasted for\n\n  about 2 hours, it wasdefinitely agreedby parties thata.     The Defendants would settle\n\n    the Plaintiffs’ claim herein and in fact will be giving their proposal for full\n\n    payment thereof by 25/2/02.b.     The Plaintiffs would not need\n\n    to look to Hoyo Crosstec Sdn Bhd (\"Hoyo\") for payments and should in fact stop\n\n    looking to them for settlement of this claim.c.     That Hoyo and the Defendants\n\n    will deal directly between themselves on how they wish to settle the payment thereof.9.    At all times, there was no mention\n\n  that this agreement was subject to any conditions. In fact, I had thought that this was\n\n  not a separate agreement but merely stating the fact of the relationships of the 3\n\n  parties; i.e. that the Defendants were liable to the Plaintiffs as contractual party and\n\n  that the Defendants should be the one looking to Hoyo for their sub-sale of the machines\n\n  to them.10.    I am also certain that at no times\n\n  were there any mention that this meeting was to be made \"Without Prejudice\". No\n\n  lawyers were involved in this meeting precisely because parties were keen and anxious to\n\n  settle this matter once and for all. Neither I nor the Plaintiffs had informed Messr Ong\n\n  Tay & Partners, the solicitors for the Plaintiffs about this meeting until 25/02/02\n\n  when we received the confirmed minutes from the Defendants. Messr Ong Tay & Partners\n\n  then wrote to the Defendants’ solicitors on the same day to record the settlement, a\n\n  copy of this facsimile dated 25/02/02 is now exhibited as \"CW-1\".11.    The Plaintiffs were therefore\n\n  shocked and baffled when they were informed by their solicitors on 27/2/02 that the\n\n  Defendants had in fact filed their Defence on the same day and were even seeking security\n\n  for costs.12.    I then called CKM and asked why\n\n  they had once again reneged on their agreement and was informed that it was because Hoyo\n\n  had not fulfilled their part of the bargain vis a vis the Defendants.’11.        I would add that paras 6\n\nto 10 of that affidavit were some of the paras which MCE was objecting to.",
        "The minutes of the meeting and other documentary\n\nevidence": "12.        The minutes of the 22\n\nFebruary 2002 meeting state:‘Meeting on 5X160T Sino\n\n  MachinesThis is the discussion on the settlement of payment, on\n\n  the part of Hoyo Crosstec, on the 5x160T machines from Sinojaya.1.    Metal Component Engineering (MCE)\n\n  agrees to assume all outstanding payment liability with SinoJaya (Sino). A legal letter\n\n  stating payment schedule (within 6 months) will be sent to Sino by 25 February 2002.2.    HoyoCrosstec (Hoyo) have to sign a\n\n  fresh sales agreement with MCE for the outstanding 3 machines (which Hoyo has not paid).\n\n  These 3 machines are 2 from Sino, plus one more that MCE sold to Hoyo.3.    Sino agrees (by Mark Wang) to\n\n  withdraw all outstanding invoices sent to Hoyo. From now no, Sino will deal directly with\n\n  MCE, and MCE will deal with Hoyo. Sino shall send a letter stating that Sino shall not\n\n  claim any more liability from Hoyo, apart from the S$35K supposed to be paid in February.4.    Hoyo has up to 12.00 noon of 25\n\n  February 2002 to (sic) signed and return the fresh sales agreement with MCE.\n\n  Failing which, MCE will assume Hoyo disagrees with this arrangement and MCE shall proceed\n\n  to take other actions against Hoyo.5.    MCE agrees to withdraw its legal\n\n  action against Hoyo once the above sales agreement is signed and received by 12.00 noon 25\n\n  February 2002.6.    Sino agrees to withdraw court order\n\n  against MCE once Sino received legal letter from MCE on the outstanding payment schedule.This minutes is sent to Hoyo’s Ano-san, Grace-san,\n\n  Sino’s Mr Lau, Charles Wong, and Mark Wang.Minutes by: CHUA Kheng Choon.Date: 22 February 2002’It was faxed to Charles Wong on 25 February 2002.13.        On the same day, Ong Tay\n\n& Partners, acting for Sinojaya sent a fax to Straits Law Practice LLC who were acting\n\nfor MCE. The fax states:‘We have been instructed by our clients that a\n\n  meeting was held on 22 Feb 2002 between your clients’ representatives and ours and\n\n  representatives from HoyoCrosstec.We are instructed that parties have agreed inter alia to\n\n  the following:a)    that (sic)you (sic)\n\n  clients’ admit liability to our clients’ claimb)    that your clients will present a\n\n  payment schedule for the full claim to be settled within 6 months from 22/2/02.c)    that our clients will withhold\n\n  enforcement proceedings unless your clients default on any of the instalment paymentPlease let us hear from you on your clients’\n\n  proposal by close of office hour tomorrow, failing which, please let us have your\n\n  clients’ Defence within the next 48 hours.In the meantime, we enclose herewith a copy of the PTC\n\n  Notice for your information.’14.        There was no written fax\n\nor letter in immediate response. However, after Sinojaya applied for summary judgment,\n\nStraits Law Practice LLC wrote to Ong Tay & Partners on 27 March 2002.  That\n\nletter states:‘SUIT NO. 111 OF 2002YCLAIM BY SINOJAYA SDN BHDWe refer to your client’s two affidavits in\n\n  support of the Order 14 application.It is our view that your firm’s letter of 30/10/01\n\n  and the minutes of the meeting as exhibited in \"LSM-6\" and circumstances\n\n  surrounding the same are privileged on the grounds that these communications (sic)\n\n  on a \"without prejudice\" basis. It is patent that these communications are\n\n  protected from disclosure. In particular the meeting in February 2002 was for the purposes\n\n  of achieving a tri-parte resolution of the disputes. Hoyo did not agree to our\n\n  client’s terms and as such there were no concluded agreement.We require you to confirm that you will delete and\n\n  strike out from the two (2) affidavits the objectionable contents. Please let us know\n\n  within the next 5 days, failing which we shall make the necessary application to\n\n  Court.’",
        "Arguments for MCE": "15.        Mr Joseph Liow, Counsel\n\nfor MCE, did not dispute that no one had specifically said prior to or at the meeting of\n\n22 February 2002, that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis. The minutes of the\n\nmeeting also did not contain this qualification.16.        However, he submitted\n\nthat, ‘A meeting does not have to be expressed as to be on a \"without\n\nprejudice\" basis in order for the matters discussed therein to be privileged from\n\ndisclosure’.17.        Civil Procedure by Jeffrey\n\nPinsler, 1994, states at p. 588 to 589:‘3.    WITHOUT PREJUDICE\n\n  COMMUNICATIONSThe rule, its rationale and scopeIt is a well-established rule that statements made\n\n  by opposing parties (or their solicitors) to each other, in the course of settlement\n\n  negotiations on the express or implied understanding that they are not to be disclosed\n\n  (that is, on ‘without prejudice’ terms), are privileged and may not be used at\n\n  the trial unless both parties consent. The rationale of this principle is that such\n\n  statements may be regarded as admissions by the party making them and used against him at\n\n  the trial. The privilege, which is rooted in the public policy of keeping litigation to a\n\n  minimum, protects the party against the disclosure of such statements, thereby encouraging\n\n  him to settle the dispute without fear. InRush & Tompkins Ltd v Greater London\n\n  Council & Anor, Lord Griffiths, in the House of Lords, said:The ‘without prejudice’ rule is a rule\n\n    governing the admissibility of evidence and is founded on the public policy of encouraging\n\n    litigants to settle their differences rather than to litigate them to the finish….\n\n    The rule applies to exclude all negotiations genuinely aimed at settlement whether\n\n    oral or in writing from being given in evidence.In Singapore, the rule is given expression in the form\n\n  of section 23 of the Evidence Act which provides:In civil cases no admission is relevant if it is made\n\n    either upon an express condition that evidence of it is not to be given, or under\n\n    circumstances from which the court can infer that the parties agreed together that\n\n    evidence of it should not be given.’18.        At p 590 to 591, the text\n\ncontinues:‘The English courts have developed a variety of\n\n  rules which make up the framework of this privilege at common law. For instance, it is\n\n  clear that operation of the privilege is not dependent on the use of the words\n\n  ‘without prejudice’ in correspondence between the parties. The House of Lords inRush & Tompkins Ltd v Greater London Council & Anordisapproved of a\n\n  linguistic approach. Lord Griffiths, who delivered the judgment, expressed the following\n\n  view:… the application of the rule is not dependent upon\n\n    the use of the phrase ‘without prejudice’ and if it is clear from the\n\n    surrounding circumstances that the parties were seeking to compromise the action, evidence\n\n    of the content of those negotiations will, as a general rule, not be admissible at the\n\n    trial and cannot be used to establish an admission … I believe that the question has\n\n    to be looked at more broadly and resolved by balancing two different public interests\n\n    namely the public interest in promoting settlements and the public interest in full\n\n    discovery between the parties to the litigation.The consequence of this approach is that although the\n\n  terminology ‘without prejudice’ is generally regarded as indicative of the\n\n  intention to settle (and is often used in practice), it is not an absolute\n\n  criterion.’19.        Mr Liow submitted that\n\npara 6 of Wong Ping Leung’s first affidavit (cited above) demonstrated that the\n\nmeeting of 22 February 2002 was to settle matters.20.        Mr Liow then submitted\n\nthat there was no concluded agreement because the agreement was intended to be a\n\ntripartite one. The minutes envisaged that Hoyo would sign a fresh sales agreement with\n\nMCE for three machines failing which MCE would assume that Hoyo disagreed with the\n\nagreement. Hoyo did not sign the fresh sales agreement.21.        Mr Liow further submitted\n\nthat there was no concluded agreement even as between Sinojaya and Hoyo for another\n\nreason. Aside from the fact that Hoyo did not sign a fresh agreement with MCE, there was\n\nas yet no agreement between Sinojaya and MCE on the payment schedule. Sinojaya was surely\n\nnot going to accept whatever MCE cared to propose as a payment schedule.",
        "Arguments for Sinojaya": "22.        Mr Ong Ying Ping, Counsel\n\nfor Sinojaya, stressed that no one had specifically said that the meeting was on a without\n\nprejudice basis and neither was this qualification stated in the minutes. However, he did\n\nnot dispute the legal principle that the privilege from disclosure could apply even if\n\nsuch words were not used.23.        As regards the second main\n\nquestion i.e whether there was a concluded agreement, he submitted that it did not matter\n\nthat Hoyo did not sign a fresh agreement with MCE as the suit was between Sinojaya and\n\nMCE. Hoyo had not formally entered the fray yet.24.        He also submitted that the\n\nminutes showed that an agreement had been reached. For example,(a)    Paragraph 1 of the minutes states\n\n  that MCE ‘agreesto assume all outstanding payment liability with Sinojaya\n\n  ….’ .(b)    Paragraph 6 states, ‘Sinoagreesto withdraw court order against MCE …’, meaning actually to withdraw the suit as\n\n  there was no court order.[Emphasis\n\n  added.]25.        There was no restriction\n\non the use of the minutes and its circulation.26.        Mr Ong also relied on the\n\ncase ofTan Yeow Khoon v Tan Yeow Tat & Anor (No. 1)[2000] 3 SLR 341for the\n\nproposition that there can be a concluded agreement if all the terms are clear, leaving\n\nonly the mechanics to be resolved. Also, the requirement of action by a third party would\n\nnot necessarily mean that there was no concluded agreement.27.        As regards the absence of\n\na payment schedule from MCE, Mr Ong suggested that this did not really matter so long as\n\nfull payment was received within the six months envisaged under paragraph 1 of the\n\nminutes.28.        His third main point was\n\nthat Sinojaya had acted on this agreement because his firm had sent the fax dated 25\n\nFebruary 2002, to which no response was received from MCE’s solicitors until much\n\nlater. The only response was the fax dated 27 March 2002, more than one month later, which\n\nalleged that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis. He submitted that by then it\n\nwas too late for MCE to raise the privilege as MCE had waived the privilege. Also it was\n\ninequitable to allow MCE to raise the privilege after taking into account these factors as\n\nwell as the fact that there was no restriction on the use of the minutes and its\n\ncirculation. MCE could not pick and choose. By this, he meant that because MCE had allowed\n\nthe minutes to be circulated to Hoyo, and as Hoyo was not a party in the proceedings at\n\nthat time, the minutes had reached the public domain. MCE had acted thereon and could not\n\nraise the privilege now.",
        "MCE’s counter-argument": "29.        Mr Liow countered by\n\npointing out that although there was no reply fax to Ong Tay & Partners’ fax\n\ndated 25 February 2002, it was not true that there was no response. That fax had sought\n\nMCE’s payment schedule the next day or MCE’s Defence to be filed within the\n\nfollowing 48 hours. MCE’s Defence was in fact filed, within the 48 hour deadline. It\n\nmust have been clear then to Sinojaya that the payment schedule was not forthcoming. Also,\n\nMCE had assumed that the meeting was on a without prejudice basis until Sinojaya applied\n\nfor summary judgment and the supporting affidavits were filed. Thereafter MCE’s\n\nsolicitors wrote, on 27 March 2002, to object to any disclosure of without prejudice\n\ncommunication.",
        "My Decision": "30.        I was of the view that the\n\nintention of the meeting of 22 February 2002 was genuinely to try and reach a settlement\n\nnot only as between Sinojaya and MCE only but involving Hoyo as well. That was why\n\nHoyo’s representatives also attended that meeting. Furthermore, in the circumstances,\n\nMCE would not agree to pay Sinojaya without knowing what its position vis--vis Hoyo was\n\nand securing an agreement from Hoyo to pay it (MCE) in turn.31.        The absence of any\n\nreference to the phrase ‘without prejudice’ was therefore not fatal to\n\nMCE’s position.32.        As regards the second\n\nquestion i.e whether there was a concluded agreement, the fact that some parts of the\n\nminutes use the word ‘agrees’ was not conclusive. The minutes were not drafted\n\nby solicitors. Besides, the opening words of the minutes stated, ‘This is the\n\ndiscussion …’ and not ‘agreement’.33.        More importantly, the\n\nsubstance of the minutes showed quite clearly that there were two outstanding issues which\n\nwere vital.34.        First, MCE’s\n\nsolicitors were to send a payment schedule by 25 February 2002. I did not accept the\n\nsuggestion that this was an inconsequential term. If a payment schedule had been forwarded\n\nand was not to Sinojaya’s liking, I had no doubt in my mind that Sinojaya would have\n\nrejected it.35.        I was reinforced in this\n\nview from the fax dated 25 February 2002 from Ong Tay & Partners. Although it said\n\nthat the parties had agreed on various terms, this should not be considered in isolation.\n\nWhat did the parties agree to? One of the terms was that a payment schedule was to be sent\n\nby MCE’s solicitors. Indeed, the fax went on to refer to the payment schedule as\n\nMCE’s ‘proposal’ thus indicating that it was open to Sinojaya to reject it\n\nif it was not to Sinojaya’s liking. Unlike the minutes, the fax was drafted by\n\nsolicitors.36.        I was of the view that the\n\nfax from Ong Tay & Partners detracted from, rather than supported, the contention that\n\nthere was a concluded agreement.37.        Secondly, Hoyo had to\n\nagree to the terms recorded in the minutes by signing and returning a fresh sales\n\nagreement between MCE and Hoyo for three of the machines. As I have said, the purpose of\n\nthe meeting was to achieve a tripartite agreement and not an agreement between Sinojaya\n\nand MCE only. This was reflected in the minutes. If, as turned out to be the case, Hoyo\n\ndid not signify its agreement, the whole deal was off.38.        In the circumstances, I\n\ndid not agree that there was a concluded agreement on 22 February 2002 between Sinojaya\n\nand MCE.39.        The case ofTan Yeow\n\nKhoonrelied upon by Mr Ong was on different facts. There, the plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants were all siblings. They were shareholders of three family-owned companies. The\n\nparties eventually met on two days to discuss their differences resulting in an agreement\n\nencapsulated in a letter being sent by the first defendant’s solicitors. The letter\n\nwas cited, with emphasis added, by Justice M P H Rubin as follows:‘We refer to the above matters and to the meetings\n\n  held on 17 November 1995 and 24 November 1995.As arranged, we write to confirm that the parties, as\n\n  a step towards achieving a comprehensive settlement of the disputes between them, have\n\n  agreed to the following:1    Tan Yeow Khoon shall act for\n\n  himself and for Tan Yeow Lam as one party (Yeow Khoon).2    Tan Yeow Tat shall act for himself\n\n  and Tan Guek Tin as one party (Yeow Tat).3    Yeow Tat shall sell his interest in\n\n  the three companies (Companies):a     Soon Hock Container & Warehousing Pte Ltd;b     Soon Hock Transportation Pte Ltd;c     Cogent Container Services Pte Ltd.4    Yeow Khoon shall buy Yeow Tat’s\n\n  interest in the Companies.5    The purchase price of the interest\n\n  in the Companies shall be based on the value of the companies as at 31 October 1995.6    The value of the Companies shall be\n\n  based on the audited book value but subject to the following:(a)    adjusted for market value of the\n\n    immovable properties owned by the company;(b)    adjusted for payments made by the\n\n    Companies other than for business purposes for the period 1 January 1990 to 31 October\n\n    1995;(c)    adjusted for transactions between\n\n    the Companies and Wah Tien for the period 1 January 1990 to 30 October 1995;(d)    adjusted for transactions between\n\n    the Companies and Hoon Nam for the period 1 January 1990 to 30 October 1995.7    The valuation of the immovable\n\n  properties shall be carried out as follows:a      Yeow Khoon shall appoint, at their own cost, Richard Ellis\n\n  to undertake the valuation;b     Yeow Tat shall appoint, at their own cost, Knight Frank to\n\n  undertake the valuation;c     The valuation of the immovable properties shall be arrived at by\n\n  taking the average figure of the two valuations.8The mechanism as to how the\n\n  adjustments set out in paragraph 6(b), (c) and (d) are (sic) to be ascertained will be\n\n  further discussed at the next meeting fixed for Thursday, 7 December 1995.9    Yeow Khoon shall pay Yeow Tat an\n\n  amount equal to 25% value of the Companies. If the amount is below $2m, it shall be paid\n\n  in one lump sum. If it exceeds $2m, the excess beyond $2m shall be payable in instalments\n\n  to be agreed upon provided that the entire consideration is to be paid without a year from\n\n  the date of the 1st payment.10    Tan Guek Tin shall tender her\n\n  resignation as a director and employee of the Companies upon the signing of the\n\n    agreement and shall be entitled to six (6) months paid leave immediately. Tan\n\n  Yeow Tat shall tender his resignation as a director and employee of the Companies upon the\n\n  payment of the last instalment to him referred to in paragraph 9 hereof.11    Yeow Khoon shall procure the\n\n  unconditional release of Yeow Tat from all guarantees executed by them for the Companies.12    Yeow Khoon confirms that they and\n\n  the Companies shall have no further claims against Yeow Tat and Yeow Tat confirms that\n\n  they shall have no further claims against Yeow Khoon and the Companies.As agreed, please let us have copies of the leases of\n\n  all the immovables properties owned by the companies and the floor plans of these\n\n  properties on an urgent basis. As we have indicated, our clients require these documents\n\n  to obtain a valuation of these properties.[Emphasis added.]’The letter was referred to as ‘the letter\n\nagreement’.40.        Subsequently, there was a\n\nmeeting on 7 December 1995 to work out the mechanism mentioned. A company secretary\n\nrecorded the minutes of the meeting which minutes reflected the steps to be taken by\n\nvarious parties.41.        In these circumstances,\n\nRubin J concluded that the letter agreement contained all the essential terms of a valid\n\nand binding agreement. What remained was the mechanism as to who should be the expert\n\nvaluer to determine the adjustments to be made to the audited book value of the companies.\n\nHe considered this to be a subsidiary aspect and not a point vital to the agreement.\n\nApparently, the absence of an agreement on an instalment payment for the excess beyond $2m\n\nwas not raised as an argument against the existence of a concluded agreement.42.        In the case before me, the\n\npayment schedule was, in my view, a vital part of the intended agreement. Secondly, it was\n\na vital part of the intended agreement that Hoyo agree to be bound by it and it did not\n\nagree. Hoyo was not just a third party who would assist the parties to implement an\n\nagreement. It was supposed to be a party to the very agreement in dispute.43.        As regards the third main\n\npoint raised by Mr Ong, I did not agree that Sinojaya had acted on the alleged agreement\n\nwhen Ong Tay & Partners sent their fax dated 25 February 2002 to Straits Law Practice\n\nLLC. This fax was to follow up on what had been discussed and had sought MCE’s\n\npayment schedule for Sinojaya to consider. Furthermore, the fax gave MCE an alternative in\n\nits ultimatum: to forward the proposed payment schedule or file its Defence. As Mr Liow\n\nhad submitted, MCE did respond, although not in the way that Sinojaya would have wanted.\n\nThe Defence was filed. I did not see how Mr Wong Ping Leung could genuinely assert (in his\n\nfirst affidavit) that Sinojaya was shocked and baffled when it was informed that the\n\nDefence had been filed, given that this was an option given to MCE by Ong Tay &\n\nPartners.44.        I was also of the view\n\nthat the fax of Ong Tay & Partners did not assert that there was a concluded agreement\n\nand it gave the contrary impression. There was nothing for MCE to dispute at that time.\n\nThere was no waiver by MCE.45.        As for the circulation of\n\nthe minutes, they were sent to Sinojaya and to Hoyo. I did not agree that they were in the\n\npublic domain just because Hoyo was not a party to the proceedings at that time. In any\n\nevent, the absence of any specific restriction on the circulation of the minutes did not\n\nmake it inequitable for MCE to argue that the minutes were inadmissible as evidence. Even\n\ndocuments which are admittedly subject to the without prejudice qualification may be\n\ncirculated. The prohibition is not against circulation but against admission in a court,\n\nor tribunal, of law as evidence.46.        MCE was not picking and\n\nchoosing parts of the minutes it would use and parts which it would not.47.        In the circumstances, I\n\nwas of the view that the shoe was on the other foot. It was inequitable for Sinojaya to\n\nnow try and rely on the minutes of the 22 February 2002 meeting to bolster its summary\n\njudgment application against MCE.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
