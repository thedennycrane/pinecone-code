        "The prosecution`s submissions on sentence": "The prosecution urged me to impose life imprisonment on the accused in view of the savagery of the attack on the deceased and his mental condition as described above. The prosecution described the accused as `a walking time bomb` who was a danger to himself and to the people around him.",
        "The defence`s submissions on sentence": "Defence counsel emphasised that this was the accused`s first brush with the law in every sense of the word in his 51 years. He had never previously exhibited any character of a violent nature.His actions in calling the police and readily admitting to the offence at the scene and during the investigations bore testimony to the degree of his remorse.The accused had known the deceased for about 30 weeks when they decided to get married. He loved her but began to realise later that it was probably a marriage of convenience and not love where his deceased wife was concerned. They had sexual relations only twice and even then, she had made it clear that she had no wish to become pregnant. Her behaviour and her actions played on his troubled mind and that caused him to suffer the delusional disorder.Dr R Nagulendran, an experienced psychiatrist presently in private practice and a Visiting Consultant at the National University of Singapore Health Service, examined the accused at Queenstown Remand Prison recently on 7, 12 and 14 September 2001 and concluded as follows in his report dated 15 September 2001:(1) At the time of the alleged offence Kwok Teng Soon suffered from Delusional Disorder in that he believed that his wife was unfaithful to him and had caused harm to him.(2) This condition does not amount to unsoundness of mind.(3) This condition, however, is an Abnormality of Mind of such severity as to have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts.(4) This Abnormality of Mind satisfies the criteria for Diminished Responsibility.(5) He is fit to plead.(6) Prior to the alleged offence he had not exhibited any violent behaviour to others. The incident of his banging of his head at the Centre for Communicable Diseases was a suicidal gesture when he believed that he was suffering from AIDS that he considered as incurable.(7) The prognosis for his illness is favourable in that he responded to treatment quickly.(8) Being the first episode of violent behaviour the duration of treatment and follow-up is two years.(9) It is unlikely he would repeat the offence again as he has regained insight and does not hold to any delusions or exhibit any other abnormal mental symptoms.(10) It is unlikely that he would be a threat to others or to himself.It was submitted that `the Accused`s delusional state was brought and caused directly by his perception that he was being \"cheated\" on by his wife` and, in that sense, was `person specific`. He was now 51 years old and if sentenced to ten years` imprisonment, was hardly likely to be in a similar situation again with someone else upon his release. His mental condition had started only recently and could therefore be cured quickly. He had responded well to the medication prescribed and was now taking only one tablet a day instead of the three different types of medication previously. His brother was prepared to ensure that he continue with his medication in future.",
        "The decision of the court": "InNeo Man Lee v PP[1991] SLR 146[1991] 2 MLJ 369, the then Court of Criminal Appeal, in dealing with an accused person suffering from chronic schizophrenia and convicted and sentenced under s 304(a) of the Penal Code to life imprisonment, said ([1991] SLR 146 at 148; [1991] 2 MLJ 369 at 370):The deputy public prosecutor referred us to a report on sentencing from the Criminal Division of the Court of Appeal in England in the case ofR v Rowland Jack Foster Hodgson[1968] 52 Cr App R 113which carried the following statement by MacKenna J, with which we are in broad agreement:`When the following conditions are satisfied, a sentence of life imprisonment is in our opinion justified: (1) where the offence or offences are in themselves grave enough to require a very long sentence; (2) where it appears from the nature of the offences or from the defendant`s history that he is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in the future; and (3) where if the offences are committed the consequences to others may be specially injurious, as in the case of sexual offences or crimes of violence.`The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal after stating that the conditions for life imprisonment were clearly satisfied in that case.This authority was considered and applied by me inPP v Ong Wee Teck[2001] 3 SLR 479, where a sentence of life imprisonment was also imposed on an  accused who was suffering from schizophrenia and who had killed his elder brother by inflicting multiple incised wounds with a chopper.Recently, inPP v Dolah bin Omar[2001] 4 SLR 302, Choo Han Teck JC also imposed life imprisonment under s 304(a) of the Penal Code on a 55-year-old man who had bludgeoned his 79-year-old uncle to death with a stool and then cut off the genitals of the deceased. It was an utterly gruesome killing and although the prosecution there called for the imposition of life imprisonment because of the repulsive nature of the offence, Choo JC made it clear it was not on that basis that he handed down the sentence. The accused in that case also had a history of chronic schizophrenia since the 1960s. He was markedly disabled socially and intellectually and was not able to be employed gainfully. The offence in question was the only known incident of violence in his record of antecedents.At [para ]10 of his grounds of decision given on 4 September 2001, Choo JC said:Mr Nazim pleaded for the accused be confined in a mental institution as opposed to being sentenced under s 304(a) of the Penal Code. But as I have stated above, on the facts, this accused does not qualify to be acquitted on the ground of unsoundness of mind and the only orders that I could make are those under s 304(a). Given the nature of his illness the closest order to a long term detention with medical rehabilitation would be, in my view, a sentence of life imprisonment; but if I do not provide any sound basis why a person whose mental capacity (for the commission of the offence charged) was diminished by a chronic and serious mental illness should be punished to the maximum limit provided under s 304(a) it is because there is none save the utilitarian one that I have adopted for this case.The fact that the accused persons in the above three cases were suffering from schizophrenia or chronic schizophrenia, a major mental illness, does not make those cases distinguishable from the present one where the accused is suffering from delusional disorder. I note defence counsel`s emphasis that `there are mental illnesses and mental illnesses` and that none of the reports has described delusional disorder as a major mental illness. I also note Choo JC`s statement (at [para ]9 of his grounds of decision) that `mental disorders are of different types and each has a wide range in terms of the degree of affliction`. However, Dr Nagulendran has said that the accused`s condition was `an abnormality of mind of such severity as to have substantially impaired his mental responsibility for his acts`.In my opinion, the inquiry should not be on how a particular illness is classified but should focus on the central theme inNeo Man Lee`s three conditions - ie whether the accused is a person of unstable character likely to commit such offences in future. The purpose of the three conditions is not to determine how evil a particular accused person can be. Rather, it is to extrapolate from his condition and his actions, the likelihood of a relapse and what the probable consequences might be.I think the facts here fell squarely within the principles inNeo Man Lee(supra). The accused has not been cured. He would require long-term treatment which could lead to a remission but that would be premised on his `total compliance with treatment`. Much as I commended his brother`s willingness to do his part, I was not at all confident that a grown-up man like the accused, accustomed to living by himself, would always be amenable to reason and to  supervision by a brother. Despite his relatively short history of mental disorder, we have seen how devastating the effects could be when something triggered him off. In the circumstances, life imprisonment would be the only appropriate sentence and I sentenced him accordingly, with the sentence deemed to have commenced on 22 March 2001, the date he was arrested and kept in custody.Outcome:Accused sentenced to life imprisonment.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
