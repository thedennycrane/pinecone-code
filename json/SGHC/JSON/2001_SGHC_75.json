        "The pleadings": "25. In her lengthy statement of claim, the plaintiff alleged inter alia, that the\n\nthree (3) defendants knew or ought to have known that without her consent or knowledge, the first\n\ndefendant would be acting in breach of trust and or placing the plaintiff's interests in the 5,030\n\nsq.ft. of land at risk by discharging the OCBC mortgage, cancelling the construction loan and\n\nre-mortgaging the property as security for the third defendants' loan. She further alleged that in\n\nbreach of the terms of the Option, the first defendant had failed to deliver the plaintiff's plot\n\nno. 3 and bungalow within the period agreed or at all. The plaintiff averred that when Earling\n\nbecame indebted to the third defendants in excess of $5m on 9 May 1997, the first defendant had\n\nfraudulently and or dishonestly committed breach of trust and fiduciary duty.26. As against the second and third defendants, the plaintiff alleged that they\n\nwere accountable to her as constructive trustees. Accordingly, the plaintiff prayed for a\n\ndeclaration that all three defendants as constructive trustees are accountable to her (and that they\n\npay) for her loss and damages which repeated what has been set out in para 21 above. The plaintiff\n\nalso prayed for a declaratory order that her beneficial interest over the said 5,030 sq.ft of land\n\nhas priority over any interests of the first and or third defendants.27. In her defence, the first defendant averred she had extended to the\n\nplaintiff, a copy of the plan prepared by the architects, submitted to and approved by the relevant\n\nauthorities (indicating the three (3) plots for the bungalows) based upon which the plaintiff had\n\nchosen plot no. 3. Consequently, the plaintiff could have filed a caveat upon receipt of the plan so\n\nas to protect her interest in the property. Notwithstanding that the first defendant did not provide\n\na site plan, the fact that the plaintiff was able to file the caveat proved that a site plan was not\n\nneeded. As the plaintiff and or her legal advisors could have but failed to, file the caveat earlier\n\nthan 11 June 1998, the first defendant contended that the plaintiff was herself negligent.28. The first defendant also pleaded that the completion of the bungalows was\n\naffected by the regional economic crisis which caused Earling (which carried out the development) to\n\nrun into difficulties and ultimately to go into liquidation. Consequently, the failure to complete\n\nwas beyond her control.29. The first defendant denied that any form of trust, implied or otherwise, was\n\ncreated in favour of the plaintiff and that she held any or any undivided share of the said property\n\non trust for the plaintiff. The first defendant averred she owed no duty to the plaintiff to notify\n\nthe plaintiff/obtain the plaintiffs consent to, the discharge of the mortgage of OCBC or the\n\nre-mortgage of the property to the third defendants; there was no clause in the Option which\n\nprohibited the first defendant from re-mortgaging the property to the third defendants in particular\n\nor, generally to any other financial institution. The first defendant put the plaintiff to strict\n\nproof she had acted in any breach of trust by herself or in collusion with either the second or the\n\nthird defendants.30. The first defendant contended that cl 19 of the Option would only operate as\n\nand when a private lot number is allotted. As no such allotment was made, the first defendant's\n\nobligation to obtain the consent of the paramount mortgagee for the lodgement of the plaintiff's\n\ncaveat did not arise. This fact was known to the third defendants as, by their letter dated 7 May\n\n1997 (see 1AB193) to the second defendants, the third defendants had agreed to the discharge of one\n\n(1) unit free of payment on condition that the same was transferred to the plaintiff or, as the\n\nfirst defendant may direct, in accordance with the agreement between the first defendant and the\n\nplaintiff. Consequently, the first defendant had preserved the plaintiff's rights.31. The first defendant further pleaded that in or around September 1997, she had\n\nprocured a purchaser (Tancho Properties) for one of the other 2 units of bungalows at a price of\n\n$3.6m but the plaintiff would not give her consent to the sale, pursuant to cl 22 of the Option. The\n\nfirst defendant therefore withdrew the offer to the prospective purchaser and thereby lost the\n\nopportunity to secure the necessary funding for completion of the construction of the bungalows.32. As for the third defendants, they denied any knowledge of the plaintiff's\n\nalleged interest in the property as it was not registered in the land register as at 9 May 1997. The\n\nthird defendants referred to cl 6(2) of the Regulating Agreement which stipulated that the third\n\ndefendants would grant a partial discharge of their mortgage (on plot no. 3) once 85% of the sale\n\nprice of one (1) unit was paid to the third defendants, provided plot no.3 was transferred to the\n\nplaintiff. As no monies were paid to the third defendants pursuant to cl 6(2) of the Regulating\n\nAgreement and one (1) unit of the bungalows was not even completed, plot no. 3 was not transferred\n\nto the plaintiff nor were the third defendants obliged to grant a partial discharge of mortgage\n\nthereon. The third defendants asserted that the terms of their mortgage, the Regulating Agreement\n\nand or loan agreement were not made subject to any rights which the plaintiff might be entitled to,\n\nunder the Option. Neither did the terms of the Option prohibit the first defendant from subsequently\n\ngranting security over the property (including a mortgage) to any creditor nor, that any security\n\ngranted subsequently would be subject to any interests which the plaintiff may have arising from the\n\nOption.33. The third defendants denied they had acted dishonestly or with knowing\n\nassistance or with any knowledge as alleged, or at all. They further denied they were/are\n\nconstructive trustees as alleged or that they are accountable to the plaintiffs as constructive\n\ntrustees.34. Although Replies were filed by the plaintiff to the defences of all three (3)\n\ndefendants, I do not propose to review them as essentially those pleadings reiterated the plaintiffs\n\nposition in her statement of claim.35. I should point out that on 10 November 2000, after the plaintiff had closed\n\nher case and when Wee was being cross-examined by counsel (Mr Ponniah) for the plaintiff, her\n\ncounsel applied to further amend the statement of claim to inter alia, include references to the\n\nthird defendants Regulating Agreement. I overruled the strenuous objections of all three (3)\n\ncounsel for the defendants and allowed some (only) of the amendments proposed, on terms of costs to\n\nthe defendants (in any event) and granted the defendants leave to make consequential amendments to\n\ntheir pleadings.The evidence(i) the plaintiffs case36. I proceed next to review the evidence adduced at the trial starting with the\n\ntestimony of the plaintiff and that of her witnesses (2). In paras 2 to 18 above, I have more or\n\nless set out the plaintiffs version of the facts which was largely undisputed by the other two\n\n(2) defendants; I turn my attention therefore to her cross-examination.37. Questioned by counsel for the first defendants, the plaintiff agreed she had\n\nbeen extended a copy of the terms of the construction loan and had discussed it with WAP. Although\n\nshe was not aware of OCBCs second letter of offer, she knew that the bank wanted to cap the area\n\nof land for her unit and, that it resulted from the exchange of correspondence between her\n\nsolicitors and the second defendants in finalising the terms of the Option.38. Cross-examined by counsel for the second defendants, the plaintiff insisted\n\nthat the mortgagee of the property must be OCBC notwithstanding that the words in cl 19 of the\n\nOption contained the wordsparamount mortgageereplacingOCBCin the initial draft\n\nprepared by WAP39. Further cross-examination revealed that the plaintiff had lent the first\n\ndefendant $700,000 as evidenced in a personal loan agreement dated 24 November 1996 (see 1AB462)\n\nprepared by WAP. The plaintiff explained that she lent the sum at the first defendants request\n\nbecause the latter/Wee needed some cash (N/E 37) but she did not ask them why. Under the terms\n\nof the option [see cl 7(a)and (b)] the first defendant was obliged to pay $3.08m by the completion\n\ndate (15 November 1996) or within one (1) month from the date of in-principle approval whichever is\n\napplicable; another $700,000 was payable within one (1) week of the issue of written permission to\n\ncommence construction which, being only granted on 19 June 1997 meant that it was not due until 26\n\nJune 1997. The plaintiff however requested the first defendant to pay this second instalment\n\ntogether with the completion sum; the latter obliged. The plaintiff then lent the $700,000 to the\n\nfirst defendant nine (9) days later.40. The plaintiff admitted receiving a copy of the third defendants letter\n\ndated 7 May 1997 to the second defendants (1AB193) which contained the following paragraphs:-(a) A partial discharge of the mortgage will be given for one unit upon full\n\n  settlement of the term loan;(b) One unit will be discharged free of payment on condition that the said unit\n\n  is transferred to the previous land owner or as he may direct in accordance with the agreement\n\n  between the mortgagor and the previous land owner;(c) The third unit will remain mortgaged to the Bank to secure the overdraft\n\n  facility. The mortgagor is to seek the banks consent on the selling price prior to selling the\n\n  unit.As such, the partial discharge upon receipt of 85% of the purchase price stated\n\n  in clause 4 of the letter of offer is on condition that the debt to the Bank is fully settled.41. Cross-examined, the plaintiffs son Leslie (PW2) also agreed that when Wee\n\nhanded him a copy of OCBCs letter of offer dated 4 September 1996, he noted that it contained\n\nunder the headingSecurity(see 1AB38) this condition:-The facilities shall be secured against first legal mortgage of $6,100,000 of a\n\n  piece of land at 124 Branksome Road and proposed 3 units of 2 storey bungalow to be erected\n\n  thereon.(MK 25 lot 117-31)Tenure: freeholdLand area: 15,172 sfLeslie was unaware that the plaintiff had lodged a caveat after the property had\n\nbeen sold/transferred to the first defendant nor of the change of mortgagees from OCBC to the third\n\ndefendants, until after the events.42. The plaintiffs last witness was her lawyer WAP (PW3); I take judicial\n\nnotice of the fact that he is a senior practitioner (called to the Singapore Bar in September 1978)\n\nand a conveyancer. Notwithstanding the pivotal role he played (indeed it can be said that the Option\n\nhe prepared was the genesis of these proceedings), WAPs written testimony was brief to the\n\nextreme. His affidavit of evidence consisted of three (3) short paragraphs in one (1) of which he\n\nmerely confirmed that the matters deposed to in the plaintiffs affidavit were true in respect of\n\nher instructions to his firm (which included preparing the Option) and in respect of his firms\n\nconduct on those instructions, including the correspondence with the various parties referred to.\n\nHowever, the brief affidavit was good enough to waive solicitor and client privilege (without\n\nqualification I would add, contrary to Mr Ponniahs assertion that such waiver excluded WAPs\n\nattendance notes) as it has to be read in conjunction with para 28 of the plaintiffs affidavit\n\nevidence-in-chief which stated:-From the inception, M/s Wong & Lim on my instructions and as my solicitors\n\n  corresponded with Keppel and their solicitors, Derby, the second defendants as solicitors for\n\n  Betsy [the first defendant] and OCBC and M/s Khattar Wong & Partners as solicitors for the\n\n  third defendants.I waive the solicitor and client privilegethat I am entitled to in\n\n  relation to my instructions to M/s Wong & Lim pertaining to the correspondence relating to the\n\n  above matters.(emphasis mine).43. Questioned by counsel (Mr Tan) for the second defendants, WAP admitted the\n\nplaintiff had indeed instructed him to sell only  of the property; he contended that he did comply\n\nwith her instructions notwithstanding that the Option did not say so (when questioned by the court\n\n[N/E161]). He said it was implied from the fact that in addition to the cash consideration of $4.2m,\n\nthe plaintiff would receive one (1) bungalow with a land area of 5,030 sq. ft, which approximated \n\nof the total area of the property. He had not objected when OCBCs (original) letter of offer was\n\nshown to him stating that the security for the same would be a mortgage over the entire property. As\n\nhis initial draft giving the plaintiff liberty to lodge a caveat over the land before the bank's\n\nmortgage was registered was not acceptable, WAP agreed with JL/the second defendants that legal\n\ntitle to the whole property would be transferred to the first defendant and upon construction of the\n\nbungalows, one (1) unit would be re-transferred to the plaintiff. Asked why he had not stated\n\nexpressly in the Option that  of the land would be returned to the plaintiff, WAP said it wasnot\n\nnecessary(N/E82). Neither did he think it necessary to draw up a supplemental agreement to\n\nprotect the plaintiff interests in retaining  of the property. As Keppel was breathing down his\n\nclients neck, he said there was no time to subdivide the land so as to enable the plaintiff to\n\nsell only  thereof. Hence, he took a calculated risk by having her sell the entire property on the\n\nimplied condition that  thereof would be returned to her with a bungalow. WAP admitted quite\n\ncandidly (N/E92) that it did not occur to him to try and protect the plaintiffs interests by\n\nselling the property to the first defendant by way of a tenancy-in-common in unequal ( ) shares;\n\nhowever he speculated that the sale might not have gone through using that method.44. Despite the clear wording in the Consideration column (spelt out earlier in\n\npara 10) in the Transfer instrument, WAP insisted that the detached house stated thereindid notform part of the Consideration even though he repeated the exact same wording for the Grounds of\n\nClaim, in the caveat he eventually lodged on 11 June 1998. However, he did agree that there was\n\nno prohibition in the Option against the first defendant changing mortgagees.45. Although the significance of the change could not/should not have been lost\n\non him, WAP surprisingly did not ascertain from JL/the second defendants why the wordOCBChad been deleted and replaced by the wordsparamount mortgageein cl 19 of the Option (see\n\npara 8 supra). He was equally candid in his admission (N/E98) that he could have made provision in\n\nthe Option for a caveat to be filedafter, notbefore, OCBCs mortgage but he did\n\nnot. He opined that had he done so, it might have jeopardised the sale of the other two (2)\n\nbungalows. However, he acknowledged that had he done so, it would have ensured that the plaintiff\n\nwas alerted should the first defendant change mortgagees. Neither did it occur to WAP to provide a\n\nvendors lien to the plaintiff in the Option. WAP agreed with counsel that as the Option did not\n\ncontain a prohibition against changing the nature of the loan, it could not be said that JL had\n\nparticipated in any dishonest transaction when the first defendant discharged OCBCs mortgage and\n\nre-mortgaged the property on different terms to the third defendants. He further agreed that his\n\nfirm may have acted in a conflict situation (NE104) after it received the letter dated 23 August\n\n1999 in 1AB258 (see para 23 supra) from the second defendants alleging that his firm (Wong &\n\nLim) had been negligent. He said by then he had passed the plaintiffs file to his litigation\n\npartner (Mr Ponniah) and he was not aware of the second defendants letter nor of what transpired\n\nsubsequently.46. Pursuant to my direction to the plaintiffs solicitors (to give additional\n\ndiscovery to the defendants solicitors of documents with Wong & Lim), further documents were\n\nproduced from the plaintiffs conveyancing file. Included therein was a letter dated 3 July 1996\n\n(see 5AB47) from Derby to the plaintiffs solicitors forwarding a topographical survey drawing as\n\nwell as the architects drawing on site calculation (see 5AB48). WAP however disagreed that the\n\nlatter drawing was the site plan needed for lodging a caveat  he understood from his conveyancing\n\nclerk it was not the plan required (N/E117). Hence, he made no attempt to lodge a caveatafter3 July 1996 butbefore11 June 1998, based on either drawing Derby had sent to him.47. Another document extracted from the plaintiffs file was a copy to the\n\nplaintiff of a letter dated 16 October 1997 written by the first defendants architects (Atelier\n\nGroup Architects) to the Building Control Division of the Public Works Department applying for BP\n\n(building plan) approval. Amongst the documents forwarded with that letter was a site plan (item 2).\n\nWAP agreed he received the letter (via fax on 28 October 1997) from Leslie but, he could not recall\n\nwhat he did upon receipt thereof nor why he did not have a copy of the site plan, which would have\n\nenabled him to lodge a caveat.48. Yet a third document extracted from the plaintiffs file was a draft caveat\n\n(without plan attached) dated 18 December 1996 which WAP (or some other solicitor in his firm)\n\npresumably prepared. In substance, it was no different from the caveat which the plaintiff lodged on\n\n11 June 1998. WAP agreed there was nothing to prevent him from lodging that caveat as drafted; he\n\nmaintained however that he wanted to adhere to the terms of the Option and not lodge a caveat over\n\nthe entire property but, only over plot no.3.49. Another significant piece of evidence which emerged from WAPs\n\ncross-examination was his statement (N/E 169-170) that the reason the third defendants gave a loan\n\nto the first defendant was because there was no caveat on record as at 9 May 1997. Had the plaintiffs\n\ncaveat been filed by then, the third defendants would have requested for its removal and thereby\n\nalerted the plaintiff to the third defendants loan.50. The following admissions were also extracted from WAP under cross-examination\n\nby counsel for the second and third defendants (N/E 185-189):-a. JL/the second defendants conduct in acting for the first and third\n\n  defendants as well as for OCBC did not cause the plaintiffs interests to be put at risk;\n\n  neither did JL act dishonestly or knowingly assist the first defendant in any breach of trust;b. had the sale by the plaintiff to the first defendant been by way of a\n\n  tenancy-in-common in unequal shares (with the plaintiff holding  ) the plaintiff would have been\n\n  informed of each and every step the first defendant took;c. if the Option had provided for no change in mortgagees or no re-financing\n\n  or, that no re-mortgage could be by way of surety or, that re-financing would be for construction\n\n  purposes only, the plaintiff would also have been protected;d. if the Option had stipulated a timeframe wherein consent from the paramount\n\n  mortgagee must be given for filing of the plaintiffs caveat, the plaintiffs interests would\n\n  again have been protected;e. if indeed a caveat had been filed over  of the land (before 11 June 1998\n\n  but after OCBCs mortgage) OCBC could not have challenged it;f. the third defendants did not breach any trust, nor dishonestly assist any\n\n  breach of trust nor, dishonestly receive trust property in breach of any trust.(ii) the first defendants case51. Wee (1DW2) was the first defendants principal witness. In her short\n\ntestimony, the first defendant (1DW1) made it clear she left everything to Wee. Essentially, the\n\nfirst defendant was Wees nominee, for reasons best known to him. Under cross-examination, Wee\n\ncontended it was the plaintiff who asked for completion earlier than the contractual date of 15\n\nNovember 1996  she wanted to redeem Keppels mortgage by 1 November 1996, it was not because he\n\nor the first defendant wanted to get their hands on the OCBC loan sooner. Eventually, the completion\n\ndate did not change but the plaintiff asked for the second instalment payment ($700,000) which was\n\nnot yet due; when the first defendant obliged, the amount was lent back to the first defendant. Wee\n\nsaid it was purely a commercial decision why he decided to change mortgagees from OCBC to the third\n\ndefendants (the interest rate was lower by 0.25%); he intended to use the loan from the third\n\ndefendants to finance the construction of the three (3) bungalows on the property as well as\n\nconstruction at another site (Telok Kurau). It was not done for any other ulterior motives. In\n\naddition to the loan from the third defendants, his company (meaning Derby) had progress payments\n\ncoming in for projects of which it was the main contractor. Further, if the remaining two (2)\n\nbungalows on the property could be sold, he/his company would have no cash flow problems. H was\n\nlooking to sell the two (2) units at $3.8m each and if the sale price was more, he would split the\n\nprofit with the plaintiff. He confirmed that the plaintiff turned down the offer of $3.6m from\n\nTancho Properties (in September 1997) for one (1) of the two (2) remaining units. In fact, the\n\nsecond defendants/JL had prepared and forwarded to Tancho Properties on 3 September 1997 a draft\n\nsale and purchase agreement (see 1AB466-481). Apparently, the plaintiffs rejection was due to\n\nLeslies influence; Leslie claimed that the market price for bungalows in that area was around\n\n$4-$5m. Had the sale to Tancho Properties materialised, Wee said he would have used the proceeds to\n\npay off the $3m then owing to the third defendants. Having lost this sale of $3.6m, it became\n\nincreasingly difficult to source for buyers as the property market was on a down-turn thereafter.(iii) the second defendants case52. It would come as no surprise that JL (2DW1) was the second defendants\n\nprincipal and indeed only, witness. She left the firm on 31 March 2000 (where she was a partner) and\n\nnow practises on her own. In acting for the first defendant, JL took her instructions from Wee, who\n\nfirst briefed/appointed her on 16 July 1996 while OCBC appointed her to act in the mortgage\n\ndocumentation by letter dated 8 October 1996.53. When he commenced his cross-examination of her, counsel for the plaintiffs\n\naccepted (N/E 252) that JL owed no duty to the plaintiff. Despite that concession however, counsel\n\nthen sought to extract from JL an admission that she knew as a fact that the OCBC mortgage afforded\n\nprotection to his client unlike the third defendants mortgage. JLs response quite naturally\n\nwas, that she saw no reason why she should have thought of the plaintiffs interests at all (then\n\nor even now) as, the plaintiff was not her client. She owed a duty to the first defendant as the\n\npurchaser and to OCBC as the first defendants mortgagees; she had negotiated the terms of the\n\nOption on the instructions of the first defendant just as she took the third defendants\n\ninstructions for the re-mortgage.54. Re-examined by counsel for the second defendants (N/E 264), JL opined that a\n\nprivate lot means a lot which is approved by the Chief Surveyor, usually when TOP (Temporary\n\nOccupation Permit) is being applied for. This is to be contrasted with the plaintiffs view\n\n(shared by her son Leslie), that there was no necessity to wait for the bungalows to be constructed\n\nbefore a survey can be done and a private lot number allocated to her unit. The plaintiff said it\n\ncould be done as soon as the land was subdivided. WAPs view also differed from JLs  he had\n\nsaid that private lot numbers are allotted to land (which is to be subdivided eventually) when\n\nplanning approval is given.55. Despite pleadingin extensoon the issue in the (re-amended) statement\n\nof claim (see para 29 thereof), it is noteworthy that in his cross-examination of JL, counsel for\n\nthe plaintiff did not at all touch on her allegations that JL had dishonestly and knowingly assisted\n\nor was an accessory to, the first defendant in the latters breach of trust against the plaintiff.",
        "(iv) the third defendants case": "56. The third defendants had three (3) witnesses namely, the former and present\n\ndeputy managers of their Geylang branch Liew Chia Wan (Liew) and Koh Ching Ching (Koh) respectively,\n\nas well as their legal manager Fadlun binte Hj Abdul Kader (Fadlun). Liew (3DW1) merely confirmed\n\nthat the plaintiff called at his branch in November 1998 and what she told him and vice versa. As\n\nfor Koh (3DW2), questioned (by counsel for the plaintiff) why the bank would take upon itself the\n\nresponsibility to ensure that one (1) bungalow would be returned to the plaintiff, his response was\n\n(N/E 270) that the third defendants were not obliged to but, since they were informed by the first\n\ndefendant, the bank was willing to give effect to the arrangement she had made with the previous\n\nowner, subject to the third defendants rights under the Regulating Agreement; it was not because\n\nthere was a trust relationship between the first defendant and the plaintiff. He also explained that\n\nthe third defendants did not earmark any part of their loan for construction of the three (3)\n\nbungalows because he understood from Earlings directors that they had their own resources to do\n\nso. Kohs testimony on the trust issue was reiterated by Fadlun (3DW3). She referred to cl 6(2)(a)\n\nof the Regulating Agreement and said the third defendants would have granted a partial discharge of\n\ntheir mortgage once they received 85% of the sale price for the first unit followed by a partial\n\ndischarge for the second unit (without receiving payment) provided it was transferred to the\n\nplaintiff.57. One of the plaintiffs allegations (se para 24 of her re-amended statement\n\nof claim) and which her counsel repeatedly raised with the various witnesses he cross-examined was,\n\nthat Earling had a paid-up capital of only $3.00 and yet, the third defendants lent the company $5m.\n\nI wish to say that this argument is simplistic as that factor cannot be considered in isolation.58. The third defendants had produced at the trial their credit application form\n\n(dated 14 April 1997) on Earling (see 3AB47) when the company applied for a loan. In addition to an\n\nopen legal mortgage of the property, the third defendants required the companys three directors\n\nto furnish personal guarantees in which regard the creditworthiness and assets of each director was\n\nevaluated. The paid-up capital of the company was also required to be increased to $1m. I cannot\n\ntherefore imagine that the third defendants would have extended any loan let alone $5-$6m to the\n\ncompany unless they considered Earlings proposed development on the property to be viable, based\n\non the feasibility study (including projected costs) the company had submitted.59. There was also an inter-office memorandum from the Geylang branch manager to\n\nFadlun on 5 May 1997 (see 4AB6) to the effect that $3m of the banks facility would be re-paid\n\nupon issuance of the TOP. It was also stated therein that there was an offer of $3.9m to buy one (1)\n\nof the bungalows; further, that one unit (identified as the third unit) would be transferred to the\n\nprevious owner free of payment. The note concluded with the comment that the branch saw no need to\n\nimpose any condition (on Earling) in view of the fact that borrowing was based on land prices valued\n\nat $8m. The inter-office memorandum apparently prompted Fadlun to write the third defendants\n\nletter dated 7 May 1997 (1AB193) to the second defendants stating inter alia, that a unit would be\n\ntransferred to the plaintiff without payment (see para 40 above).The findings(i) duty of care60. It was clear from the plaintiffs own testimony and that of her lawyer\n\n(WAP) that her claims against the second and third defendants were completely unsustainable from the\n\nvery outset. As conceded by Mr Ponniah, there was no duty owed to the plaintiff by the second\n\ndefendants and JL in particular as, the second defendants acted for the first defendant, OCBC and\n\nthe third defendants. Consequently, even if JL knew as a fact (as Mr Ponniah repeatedly raised in\n\ncross-examination) that the OCBC mortgage provided protection to the plaintiff, how does that\n\nevidence help to advance his clients case? It was WAP who owed a duty to the plaintiff to protect\n\nher interests. Equally, it is apparent from his testimony and the documentary evidence (especially\n\nthe Option) before the court, that he failed in that regard. Yet, when alerted of the possibility\n\nthat they themselves may have been negligent by the second defendants letter dated 23 August 1999\n\n(at 1AB258 see para 23 above), Wong & Lim chose to continue to act for the plaintiff and to\n\npoint the finger at others for the plaintiffs predicament, rather than take stock of the\n\nsituation and consider whether they themselves may not be at fault.61. In his cross-examination by Mr Tan (see para 45 supra) on the second\n\ndefendants aforesaid letter, WAP had said he was not aware of the same (until he reviewed the\n\ndocuments for this trial) as by then, he had passed the plaintiffs file to his litigation\n\npartner. Mr Ponniah (who is also a senior practitioner) then proceeded (first in his letters and\n\nthen in the plaintiffs statement of claim) to blame everyone else involved with the property\n\n(except for OCBC and his own firm) for the plaintiffs loss. What WAP and Mr Ponniah did was a\n\ngreat disservice to the plaintiff and their fellow solicitors the second defendants, and contravened\n\nthe following five (5) provisions of the Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules Cap 161( 2000\n\ned) (hereinafter referred to as the Rules):-Adverse interest27. Where the interest of the advocate and solicitor or any member of his\n\n  family is adverse to the interest of the client, the advocate and solicitor shall decline to\n\n  represent or withdraw from representing the client, unless the client having been fully informed,\n\n  and advised that he should seek independent legal advice, consents to the advocate and solicitor\n\n  acting or continuing to act on his behalf.Withdrawal42(1) Subject to rule 41, an advocate and solicitor may withdraw from\n\n  representing a client(e) if an advocate and solicitor has an interest in any case or mater in\n\n    which the advocate and solicitor is concerned for the client which is adverse to that of the\n\n    client;(f) where such action is necessary to avoid a contravention by the advocate\n\n    and solicitor of the Act or these Rules or any other subsidiary legislation made under the Act\n\n    or(g) where any other good cause exists.Relationship with other advocates and solicitors47. An advocate and solicitor shall treat his professional colleagues with\n\n  courtesy and fairness.Facts, arguments and allegations59. An advocate and solicitor shall not contrive facts which will assist his\n\n  clients case or draft any originating process, pleading, affidavit, witness statement or notice\n\n  or grounds of appeal containing(b) any allegation of fraud unless he has clear instructions to make such\n\n    allegations and has before him reasonable credible material which as it stands establishes a\n\n    prima facie case of fraud.Solicitor not to act if he is a witness64(1) An advocate and solicitor shall not accept instructions in a case in\n\n  which the advocate and solicitor has reason to believe that he is likely to be a witness on a\n\n  material question of fact.(2) An advocate and solicitor shall discharge himself from representing a\n\n  client if it becomes apparent to the advocate and solicitor that he is likely to be a witness on a\n\n  material question of fact.62. I could neither condone nor overlook the conduct of WAP and Mr Ponniah; their\n\nactions did not arise out of errors of judgment for which, like any other human beings who are not\n\ninfallible, they can be excused. In this case, their firm should have (but did not) immediately\n\ncease acting for the plaintiff in accordance with Rule 27 of the Rules or at all, and they did not\n\nadvise her to consult another firm of solicitors. Had the plaintiff been given such advice, another\n\nlaw firm may have made a far more objective and independent assessment of the situation and, advised\n\nthe plaintiff whether she did indeed have the claims she put forward in this suit.63. Even if Wong & Lim did not discharge themselves immediately after receipt\n\nof the second defendants letter dated 23 August 1999, Rule 64(2) of the Rules should have\n\nprompted them to do so when it became obvious that WAP would be a material witness for the\n\nplaintiff. That Rule is not complied with merely by WAP passing the plaintiffs file smartly on to\n\nhis litigation partner as there is a danger, which was the case here, that the brief by WAP to Mr\n\nPonniah was very much coloured by the formers perception of what he thought was the plaintiffs\n\ngrievance and who caused it and which, as it turned out, was completely off the mark.64. As a consequence, what Mr Ponniah did was to raise the most serious\n\nallegations of fraud against the second defendants and JL in particular, disregarding Rule 47 of the\n\nRules, when there was not one iota of evidence to substantiate such accusations, contrary to Rule\n\n59(b) of the Rules. The words used against the second defendants in the re-amended statement of\n\nclaim (para 30) were, that they haddishonestly and knowingly assisted or were an accessoryto the first defendant breach of trust who, it was alleged (in para 28 of the statement of\n\nclaim), hadfraudulently and dishonestly and or otherwisecommitted breach of trust and\n\nfiduciary duty.65. The gravamen of the plaintiffs case of fraud was based on an implied trust\n\ngrounded on cll 18(a), 19 and 20 of the Option. In cross-examination, WAP repeatedly maintained that\n\nalthough those clauses did not state that the plaintiff was selling only  but in fact the whole,\n\nof the property, it was to be implied. Such an argument goes against the very grain of s 93 of the\n\nEvidence Act Cap 97 which states:-When the terms of a contract or of a grant or of any other disposition of\n\n  property have been reduced by or by the consent of the parties to the form of a document, and in\n\n  all cases in which any matter is required by law to be reduced to the form of a document, no\n\n  evidence shall be given in proof of the terms of such contract, grant or other disposition of\n\n  property or of such matter except the document itself, or secondary evidence of its contents in\n\n  cases in which secondary evidence is admissible under the provisions of this Act.66. I had found that the plaintiffs loss arose as a direct result of WAPs\n\nshortcomings as an experienced conveyancer. I need only refer to his own testimony (set out in para\n\n50 above) to support this finding. Coupled with his agreement to allow the wordOCBCto be\n\nchanged toparamount mortgageein cl 19 of the Option and his omission to lodge a caveat\n\nimmediately or soon after OCBCs mortgage was registered (on 4 March 1997), WAPs conduct caused\n\nthe plaintiff to lose her priority against the mortgage of the third defendants. WAPs excuse that\n\nhe did not file the plaintiffs caveat soon after OCBCs mortgage because he did not receive the\n\nappropriate site plan was unsustainable as, he managed to file the caveat on 11 June 1998 (albeit\n\ntoo late) without any plan at all. He could not explain let alone satisfactorily, why he did not use\n\nthe plan prepared by the first defendants architects and forwarded to him by Leslie in October\n\n1997. Neither was I prepared to accept his cavalier explanation that his conveyancing clerk told him\n\nthe topographical survey drawing Derby forwarded to him in July 1997 could not be used. It would\n\nhave been a different matter had he tried to lodge a caveat using that drawing and the Land Titles\n\nRegistry had rejected the same; I would accept a rejection by a government authority but not that of\n\nhis unqualified clerk, however experienced. As WAP did not even try to submit the latter drawing for\n\nlodgement purposes, we will never know whether he would have succeeded. Similarly, as WAP did not\n\nmake the attempt, we will never know whether the suggestion from counsel for the second defendants,\n\nthat the sale to the first defendant could have been by way of a tenancy-in-common in unequal\n\nshares, would have been acceptable to the Registry of Titles.67. What then would have been achieved if the plaintiff had lodged her caveat\n\nimmediately after OCBCs mortgage? According to N KhublallsThe law of real property and\n\nconveyancing(3 ed at p 641), an authority cited by the third defendants:-A caveat is a document which, when lodged in the land registry, gives the\n\n  caveator, ie the person who has lodged it, the opportunity of protecting an existing right or of\n\n  establishing an existing claim. A caveat is similar in effect to an injunction, though it is not\n\n  an order of the court",
        "Without debasing the registered title, a private caveat is intended to perform\n\n  two interrelated functions. Firstly, it prevents a registered proprietor from entering into any\n\n  further dealing with his land, thereby ensuring that existing claimants on interests on such land\n\n  are given temporary protection by maintaining the status quo, especially if the land is subject to\n\n  litigation. On this point the Privy Council [inT Damodaran v Choe Kun Hin[1979] 2 MLJ 267at 269 per Lord Diplock] observed:": "Claims to be entitled to the proprietorship of land or a registered interest in\n\n  land, whether or not they are the subject of litigation, are not registrable as encumbrances on a\n\n  registered title. Instead, they are protected by a system of private caveats which, while leaving\n\n  the registered title unqualified and intact, have the effect of preventing any dealing with it by\n\n  the registered proprietor so long as the caveat remains in force, that is, until it is removed\n\n  from the registrar.Another function of a private caveat is that it gives notice to the world at\n\n  large via the land registrar as to the existence of certain claims in respect of a particular\n\n  parcel of land. The passage below from the Privy Council judgment inAbigail v Lapin[1934]   AC 491 is of particular relevance:-For the protection of equitable interests or estates the Act provides that a\n\n  caveat may be lodged with the Registrar by a person claiming as cestui que trust, or under any\n\n  unregistered instrument or any other estate or interest; the effect of the caveat is that no\n\n  instrument will be registered while the caveat is in force.until after a certain notice to the\n\n  person lodging the caveat. Thus though the legal interest is in general determined by the\n\n  registered transfer, and is in law subject only to registered mortgages or other charges, the\n\n  register may bear on its face a notice of equitable claims so as to warn persons dealing in\n\n  respect of the land and to enable the equitable claimant to protect his claim by enabling him to\n\n  bring an action if his claim be disputed.The above passage is self-explanatory of the serious consequence which resulted\n\nfrom WAPs omission to lodge a caveat for the plaintiff soon after the Transfer and OCBCs\n\nmortgage were registered.68. Before a claim for breach of trust can succeed, it is established law that\n\nthere must first of all be a relationship of trustee-beneficiary between the plaintiff and the\n\ndefendants giving rise to a fiduciary relationship. I can do no better than to quote an authority\n\nfrom the plaintiffs own bundle in this regard, an extract fromHalsburys Laws of England(4 ed [reissue] vol 48 p 343 para 501) where it is stated:Where a person has property or rights which he holds or is bound to exercise\n\n  for or on behalf of another or others, or for the accomplishment of some particular purpose or\n\n  particular purposes, he is said to hold the property or rights in trust for that other or those\n\n  others, or for that purpose or those purposes, and he is called a trustee. A trust is a purely\n\n  equitable obligation and is enforceable only in a court in which equity is administered.The trustee holds the property or must exercise his rights of property in a\n\n  fiduciary capacity, and stands in a fiduciary relationship to the beneficiary.69. The above principle of law is reinforced by the cases contained in the\n\nbundles of authorities of the plaintiff/defendants including, Royal Brunei Airlines Sdn Bhd v Tan[1995] 3 AER 97andCarl Zeiss Stiftung v Herbert Smith & Co(No. 2) [1969] 2 Ch 276. InCarl\n\nZeiss Stiftung v Herbert Smith & Co,the plaintiffs alleged that the assets and property of\n\na defendant, which was a West German foundation bearing their same name, belonged to the plaintiffs\n\nor were held on trust for them. At a time when there had been and were pending interlocutory\n\nproceedings but before the trial of the main action, the plaintiffs brought these proceedings for an\n\naccount against the West German foundations solicitors alleging that they had received money from\n\ntheir clients and, by reason of so acting, they knew all the facts and matters averred and proved or\n\nto be proved in the main action and they had notice that their clients money belonged to the\n\nplaintiffs. The plaintiffs made no allegation against the defendant solicitors integrity and\n\nhonesty and at all times emphasised that no such allegation could or was being made. The defendant\n\nsolicitors admitted receiving the money from the West German foundation on account of fees, costs\n\nand disbursements incurred or to be incurred in the main action and that they knew from time to time\n\nthe averments made by the plaintiffs. Pennycuick J dismissed the action and the plaintiffs appealed.70. The Court of Appeal (in dismissing the appeal) held that a solicitor acting\n\nhonestly in his capacity as a solicitor for his client was in no different position from any other\n\nagent acting for his principal and was not to be imputed with knowledge of a trust merely because,\n\nin acting for his client, he knew that it was claimed that against his client that there was a trust\n\nand such knowledge could not be notice of a trust or notice of misapplication of trust funds.\n\nAccordingly, since the defendant solicitors had no notice of a trust or that they had received trust\n\nfunds from their clients, they were not accountable to the plaintiffs for the moneys which had come\n\ninto their hands on account of costs, fees and disbursements. In our case, there was not even the\n\nsuggestion of a trust to begin with, before Mr Ponniah came into the picture.71. The only fiduciary relationship in our case which could possibly give rise to\n\na cause of action was that of solicitor-and-client between the second defendants and the first/third\n\ndefendants. Indeed, this was stated in the Particulars under para 31 of the statement of claim where\n\nthe plaintiff alleged that:-the second defendants as solicitors for the first defendant and for Sime Bank\n\n  [the third defendant] when instructed to discharge the OCBC mortgage and re-mortgage the said\n\n  property to Sime Bank as security for the Sime Bank loan on terms thereof;-(a) Wilfully or recklessly failed to inquire from the plaintiff or her\n\n  solicitors whether the plaintiff consents to the discharge and/or the re-mortgage of the said\n\n  property, which included the plaintiffs interest in 5,030 sq. feet of the said property.Given the admission in the plaintiffs own pleadings with herself being\n\nseparately represented by WAP coupled with, Mr Ponniahs acknowledgement that the second\n\ndefendants/JL owed no duty to the plaintiff, there was no basis for Wong & Lim to make the\n\nstrong allegation which they did, more so in the case of the third defendants, with whom the\n\nplaintiff had no privity of contract.72. As for the plaintiffs claim against the second and third defendants based\n\non constructive trusts, I refer to yet another extract (at p 360) fromHalsburys Laws(supra):-525.Resulting and constructive trusts. Resulting trusts and\n\n  constructive trusts arise, or are implied, by operation of law, and may or may not reflect the\n\n  intention of the persons concerned, whereas express trusts arise from the intention of the\n\n  disposer ascertained from the formal or informal words used by him.Resulting trusts are of two kinds. A presumed resulting trust arises from the\n\n  application of a rebuttable presumption of intention that the property purchased wholly or partly\n\n  by X but vested in Ys name should be held by Y on trust for X to the extent of Xs share in\n\n  the purchase; likewise, where there is a voluntary transfer by X into the name of Y or the joint\n\n  names of X and Y, there is a presumption of a resulting trust for X. An automatic resulting trust\n\n  arises where X transfers property to Y on trusts which for some reason fail to dispose wholly of Xs\n\n  beneficial ownership so that Y automatically and irrebuttably holds the property on trust for X to\n\n  the extent of Xs undisposed of beneficial interest.A constructive trust is automatically imposed in circumstances where it is\n\n  unconscionable or contrary to fundamental equitable principles for the owner of particular\n\n  property to hold it purely for his own benefit.In the words of Edmund Davies LJ ([at p 300] inCarl Zeiss Stiftung v Herbert\n\nSmith), what is required for a constructive trust to be imputed is thewant of probity.73. At the risk of repetition, I refer again to WAPs testimony in para 50 and\n\nto the facts set out in paras 9 and 10, above. Despite WAPs stubborn and unreasonable denial to\n\nthe contrary, the Option and Transfer clearly stated that the plaintiff sold thewholeproperty, not  thereof, to the first defendant. Consequently, no resulting or constructive trust\n\nin favour of the plaintiff can arise; she had received good and valuable consideration for theentirepiece of land from the first defendant, there was no evidence of a want of probity or any\n\nunconscionable conduct on the part of the defendants which warranted a constructive trust being\n\nimposed on any or all, of them.74. The plaintiff also failed to surmount the hurdle imposed by s 47 of the Land\n\nTitles Act Cap 157 which states:-(1) Except in the case of fraud, no person dealing with a proprietor or with a\n\n  person who is entitled to become a proprietor shall be required or in any manner concerned to\n\n  inquire or ascertain the circumstances in or the consideration for which the current proprietor or\n\n  any previous proprietor is or was registered, or to see to the application of the purchase money\n\n  or any part thereof, or is affected by notice (actual or constructive) of any bankruptcy\n\n  proceeding, trust or other unregistered interest whatsoever, any rule of law or equity to the\n\n  contrary notwithstanding;and the knowledge that any unregistered interest is in existence\n\n  shall not of itself be imputed as fraud(emphasis added)She also had to overcome s 49(2) of the same Act which states:-Knowledge of the existence of an unregistered interest which has not been\n\n  protected by a caveat shall not of itself be imputed as fraud.The underlined words in s 47 read with s 49(2) make it clear that even actual\n\nknowledge (which they admitted they had) on the part of the second and third defendants, that the\n\nfirst defendant had a contractual obligation to build a bungalow and transfer it to the plaintiff\n\nfree of payment, does not amount to fraud.75. It follows from the preceding paragraphs that the plaintiff did not have a\n\ncause of action against the first defendant either, based on breach of trust. From the documentary\n\nevidence, it was clear that the first defendant/Wee had done their best to comply with the first\n\ndefendants obligations under cll 18 and 20 of the Option to build a bungalow for the plaintiff\n\nand indeed partly performed this obligation before they and their companies (Derby and Earling) ran\n\nout of funds, victims of the 1997 regional economic crisis. They did not hide their obligation to\n\nthe plaintiff from the third defendants, as can be seen from the letter written by the third to the\n\nsecond, defendants dated 7 May 1997,beforethe third defendants mortgage was registered.\n\nNeither the plaintiff nor Leslie denied the first defendants/Wees allegation that they\n\nrejected the offer of $3.6m from Tancho Properties for one (1) of the other units of bungalows and\n\nwhich sale proceeds would have enabled Earling to finish construction of the plaintiffs unit, if\n\nnot the entire development.76. Had another law firm taken over acting for the plaintiff in place of Wong\n\n& Lim, it may well be that they would have formulated the plaintiffs claim properly and,\n\nwhich could only have been for breach of contract against the first but not against the other, two\n\n(2) defendants. The plaintiff was never given the opportunity or advised, to make this claim by\n\neither WAP or Mr Ponniah.Proceedings under Order 58 r 8 of the Rules of Court.77. After I had dismissed the plaintiffs claim on 15 November 2000, on an\n\napplication made by counsel for the second defendants (who submitted that these proceedings against\n\nhis clients were an abuse of the process of court), I ordered WAP and Mr Ponniah to show cause under\n\nO 58 r 8 of the Rules of Court, why they should not be made personally liable for the costs of the\n\nplaintiffs unsuccessful action against all three (3) defendants. Consequently, a week after the\n\ndismissal of the plaintiffs action, there was another hearing before me where WAP and Mr Ponniah\n\nwere represented by Mr C Rajah SC.78. Before I give the reasons for the orders I made, I need to set out the text\n\nof O 58 r 8, it states:Personal liability of solicitor for costs(1) Subject to this Rule, where it appears to the Court that costs have been\n\n  incurred unreasonably or improperly in any proceedings or have been wasted by failure to conduct\n\n  proceedings with reasonable competence and expedition, the Court may make against any solicitor\n\n  whom it considers to be responsible (whether personally or through an employee or agent) an order(a) disallowing the costs as between the solicitor and his client; and(b) directing the solicitor to repay to his client costs which the client has\n\n    been ordered to pay to other parties to the proceedings; or(c) directing the solicitor personally to indemnify such other parties\n\n    against the costs payable by them.After hearing the submissions from counsel for the three (3) defendants and from\n\nMr Rajah, I made an order against WAP and Mr Ponniah under the above order as regards the costs of\n\nthe second and third defendants, and which is the subject of their appeal in Civil Appeal No. 167 of\n\n2000.79. Mr Rajah as well as counsel for the defendants relied on the same authorities\n\nfor their opposing arguments. They cited the leading English authorityRidehalgh v Horsefield\n\n& Anor[1994] 3 All ER 848 where the appellate court in turn applied the principles from the\n\nHouse of Lords decision inMyers v Elman[1940] AC 282.Ridehalgh v Horsefieldwas\n\nfollowed by our Court of Appeal inTang Liang Hong v Lee Kuan Yew & Anor[1998] 1 SLR 97.80. InRidehalgh v Horsefield, the Court of Appeal considered Order 62 r\n\n11 of the 1986 Rules of the Supreme Court which wording is very similar to our O 58 r 8. Sir Thomas\n\nBingham MR (at pp 856-857) set out the five fundamental principles for whichMyers v Elmanwas authority:-(1) the courts jurisdiction to make a wasted costs order against a solicitor\n\n  is quite distinct from the disciplinary jurisdiction exercised over solicitors;(2) whereas a disciplinary order against a solicitor requires a finding that he\n\n  has been personally guilty of serious professional misconduct, the making of wasted costs order\n\n  does not;(3) the courts jurisdiction to make a wasted cost order against a solicitor\n\n  is founded on breach of the duty owed by the solicitor to the court to perform his duty as an\n\n  officer of the court in promoting within his own sphere the cause of justice;(4) to show a breach of that duty it is not necessary to establish dishonesty,\n\n  criminal conduct, personal obliquity or behaviour such as to warrant striking a solicitor off the\n\n  roll. While mere mistake or error of judgment would not justify an order,misconduct, defaultor even negligence is enough if the negligence is serious or gross;(5) the jurisdiction is compensatory and not merely punitive.81. What then do the wordsmisconduct or defaultconnote? According to\n\nLord Wright inMyers v Elman(at pp 290 and 292) it did not have to amount to disgraceful or\n\ndishonourable conduct by the solicitor, but on mere negligence of a serious character, the result of\n\nwhich was to occasion useless costs to the other parties  a serious dereliction of duty as a\n\nsolicitor either by the person himself or by his clerks.82. Several passages fromRidehalgh v Horsefieldare helpful on what is\n\nmeant byimproperandunreasonableinO 58 r 8. Sir Thomas Bingham had this to\n\nsay (at p 861):-Improper means what it has been understood to mean in this context for at\n\n  least half a century. The adjective covers but is not confined to, conduct which would ordinarily\n\n  be held to justify disbarment, striking off, suspension from practice or other serious\n\n  professional penalty. It covers any significant breach of a substantial duty imposed by a relevant\n\n  code of professional conduct. But it is not in our judgment limited to that. Conduct which would\n\n  be regarded as improper according to the consensus of professional (including judicial) opinion\n\n  can be fairly stigmatised as such whether or not it violates the letter of a professional code.Unreasonable also means what it has been understood to mean in this\n\n  context for at least half a century. The expression aptly describes conduct which is vexatious,\n\n  designed to harass the other side rather than advance the resolution of the case, and it makes no\n\n  difference that the conduct is the product of excessive zeal and not improper motive. But conduct\n\n  cannot be described as unreasonably simply because it leads in the event to an unsuccessful result\n\n  or because other more cautious legal representatives would have acted differently. The acid test\n\n  is whether the conduct permits of a reasonable explanation. If so, the course adopted may be\n\n  regarded as optimistic and as reflecting on a practitioners judgment, but it is not\n\n  unreasonable.The learned judge added (at p 863):-It is, however, one thing for a legal representative to present, on\n\n  instructions, a case which he regards as bound to fail;it is quite another to lend his\n\n  assistance to proceedings which are an abuse of the process of the court. Whether instructed\n\n  or not, a legal representative is not entitled to use litigious procedures for purposes for which\n\n  they were not intended, as by issuing or pursuing proceedings for reasons unconnected with success\n\n  in the litigation or pursuing a case known to be dishonest, nor is he entitled to evade rules\n\n  intended to safeguard the interests of justice, as by knowingly failing to make full disclosure on\n\n  ex-parte applications or knowingly conniving at incomplete disclosure documents. It is not\n\n  entirely easy to distinguish by definition between the hopeless case and the case which amounts to\n\n  an abuse of the process, but in practice it is not hard to say which is which and if there is\n\n  doubt the legal representative is entitled to the benefit of it.(emphasis underlined)83. Jeffrey Pinsler in commenting on O 58 r 8 in his bookCivil Practice in\n\nSingapore and Malaysia(1998) said (at para 452):-.the rule requires a certain degree of impropriety  as opposed to merely\n\n  unreasonable conduct or lack of diligence  on the part of the solicitor before it can operate.84. Applying the tests set out inRidehalgh v Horsefieldand following\n\nupon my earlier comments (in para 62), I was of the view that the action of WAP and Mr Ponniah in\n\ninstituting this suit against the second/third defendants was indeed an abuse of the process of the\n\ncourt; it was more than unreasonable conduct, it was inexcusable. What I found disquieting was the\n\nfact that this was not the first time that the two partners had sued another law firm over their own\n\ninaction/omission, a fact which their counsel may not be aware of.85. InPT BII Finance Centre v Eunike Juwita & Anor[2000] 3 SLR 233,\n\nthe plaintiffs, who are an Indonesian finance company, represented by Mr Ponniah, sued the second\n\ndefendant law firm (who coincidentally was represented by Mr Tan) for breaching a letter of\n\nundertaking they had furnished to the plaintiffs, to pay to the plaintiffs the sale proceeds of a\n\nSingapore property owned by the first defendant and which was mortgaged to a local bank. WAP had\n\nacted for the plaintiffs in relation to a guarantee and indemnity which the first defendant had\n\nfurnished to the plaintiffs, to secure the obligations of a company which was controlled by her\n\nhusband, to which the plaintiffs had provided factoring facilities. The second defendants had paid\n\nto the plaintiffs $63,711.62 which balance sum was all the sale proceeds they held of the property,\n\nafter paying the claim of the mortgagee bank and making other deductions. I dismissed the plaintiffs\n\naction as I took the view that the second defendants had discharged their obligations by paying over\n\nthe balance sum of $63,711.62, which sum they held at the time of the plaintiffs demand for\n\npayment, after making all the deductions stipulated in their letter of undertaking.86. In para 31 of my judgment, I had said (at p 242):-In my view, having regard to the fact that a prudent solicitor would only give\n\n  an undertaking over clients money which he holds and that it is entirely a matter of contract\n\n  whether the second defendants held the [10%]deposit as stakeholders, a reasonable person in the\n\n  position of the plaintiffs should not so readily assume that the use of the word sale proceeds\n\n  must necessarily mean 100% of the sale proceeds in the circumstances under which the undertaking\n\n  was given. Unfortunately, it was this pre-conceived notion which resulted in this litigation.The\n\n  plaintiffs could have protected their position by either taking a second mortgage on the property\n\n  or, if the former course of action was not agreed to by [the mortgagee bank], by lodging a caveat\n\n  against the property once the guarantee was executed or even later, after being notified about the\n\n  sale of the property(emphasis added).Similar to our case, the Indonesian finance companys position would have been\n\nprotected, had WAP lodged a caveat against her property, once the first defendant had executed the\n\nguarantee and indemnity in the plaintiffs favour; he did not. Yet his firm and Mr Ponniah in\n\nparticular, chose to sue another law firm for his own omission.87. Mr Tan drew my attention to yet another case where Mr Ponniah had sued a law\n\nfirm without basis, namelyActive Timber Agencies Pte Ltd v Allen & Gledhill[1996] 1 SLR 478. The plaintiffs, a Singapore registered company which was controlled by one Tiang Ming Sing\n\n(Tiang) had entered into a sale and purchase agreement with two (2) gentlemen Cam and Adam to buy\n\nover the entire shareholdings in a Vanuatu company. The defendant firm of solicitors were retained\n\nby Cam and Adam to receive payment on their behalf. The plaintiffs remitted to the defendants\n\nclients account in August 1993 the sum of US$250,000 (the sum) for account of Cam and Adam; in\n\nturn the defendants paid the sum to their clients in September 1993. Apart from that payment, there\n\nwas no communication between the plaintiffs and the defendants. According to the plaintiffs, the\n\nagreement with Cam and Adam was subsequently aborted.88. In May 1994, through their (then) solicitors, the plaintiffs demanded the\n\nreturn of the sum; the defendants naturally could not and so informed the plaintiffs pointing out\n\nthat neither the plaintiffs nor Tiang gave any instructions nor imposed any conditions as to how the\n\nsum should be dealt with, at the time the remittance was received. The plaintiffs through Wong &\n\nLim (Mr Ponniah) nevertheless persisted in their claim. In their pleadings, the plaintiffs alleged\n\nthat the defendants received the sum into their clients account as agents for the plaintiffs and\n\nclaimed the defendants were their trustees. Not surprisingly, the plaintiffs action (on the\n\ndefendants application) was struck out under O 18 r 19 of the Rules of Court, as disclosing no\n\nreasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs appeal to the Court of Appeal (against the common\n\ndecision of the assistant registrar and judge [on a registrars appeal] in striking out their\n\nclaim) was dismissed.89. I was of the view that both WAP and Mr Ponniah were guilty of a serious\n\ndereliction of duty in instituting these proceedings against the second/third defendants when\n\nclearly they had no basis at law to do so. To quote Sir Thomas Bingham inRidehalgh v Horsefield,\n\nit makes no difference that their conduct is the product of excessive zeal and not improper motive.\n\nA willingness to sue their fellow solicitors without second thoughts and without considering the\n\nmerits of their clients case and their own involvement, was not conduct which could be overlooked\n\nby any court of law. Why then should the plaintiff bear the financial consequences of their wrongful\n\nact? Accordingly, it would be highly inequitable to order her to pay the costs of the second and\n\nthird defendants.90. Consequently, I ordered that WAP and Mr Ponniah bear the plaintiffs costs\n\npayable to the second and third defendants. In so doing, I had not taken into consideration the\n\nsecond complaint put forward by counsel for the second defendants, that there had been deliberate\n\nnon-disclosure of crucial documents from the plaintiffs conveyancing file, even though solicitor\n\nand client privilege had been waived by the plaintiff. I was prompted to order further discovery by\n\nthe plaintiff as a result of counsels complaint and which led to the revelation of the three (3)\n\ndocuments referred to in paras 46 to 48 above. I gave the benefit of the doubt to WAP and Mr Ponniah\n\nthat their omission to give full discovery was an inadvertence and not deliberate. However, the same\n\nindulgence could not be extended to them in the manner they pursued the plaintiffs claim against\n\nthe second and third defendants.91. I did not make a similar order against the two (2) partners for the costs\n\npayable by the plaintiff to the first defendant; whatever her cause of action, whether it be for\n\nbreach of trust or contract, the plaintiff would have had to bear the costs of the first defendant\n\nin any event should she fail in her action. Consequently neither WAP nor Mr Ponniah should be\n\npenalised in this regard.Lai Siu ChiuJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
