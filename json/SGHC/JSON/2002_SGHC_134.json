        "SIC 1513/2001": "7 The writ in this action was filed on 18 June 2001 and\n\nserved on 20 June on the Defendants in Singapore. On 4 July 2001 the Defendants took out\n\nan application in SIC 1513/2001 to stay the action on the ground that Bangladesh is the\n\nmore appropriate forum. Two supporting affidavits were filed by Lim Kin Seng\n\n(\"Lim\"), the legal officer of SCPL. He related the background to the dealings\n\nthat SCPL had with Baridhi and HRC. SCPL had been operating feeder services in Bangladesh\n\nsince 1989 and between 1995 and 2000, Baridhi was SCPL’s agent in Bangladesh. However\n\nSCPL terminated this arrangement with effect from 15 April 2000 and appointed a new agent,\n\nEverbest Shipping Agencies Ltd (\"Everbest\"). SCPL believed that Baridhi began to\n\nallocate EMC cargo to HRC, which started feeder operations only in 1997. HRC had somehow\n\npersuaded the Director-General (Shipping) not to issue waiver certificates to foreign\n\nfeeder operators such as SCPL. Without such certificates, a foreign operator of feeder\n\nservices would be liable to punishment by a fine up to the value of the cargo. Lim stated\n\nthat it was obvious that HRC had sought to eliminate competition by unfair means through\n\nthe use of the said legislation. After taking legal advice in Bangladesh, SCPL, through\n\nits agent Everbest, commenced legal proceedings on 27 March 2001 in Bangladesh against the\n\nDirector-General (Shipping) and others in Writ Petition No.992 of 2001. One of the\n\nremedies sought was a declaration that the Director-General was to refrain from refusing\n\nto grant waiver certificates under the influence of HRC. On 27 March 2001, the Bangladeshi\n\nHigh Court made an interim order that the Director-General was not to refuse any waiver\n\nfor a period of two months. However on application by HRC on 8 May 2001, this order was\n\nstayed.8 As to the e-mail in question, Lim deposed that EMC\n\nhad, around September 2000 and pursuant to SCPL’s request, instructed HRC to share\n\nout the cargo load for the Chittagong-Colombo sector in the proportion 60:40 in favour of\n\nSCPL. However despite this HRC continued blatantly to object to the issuance of waiver\n\ncertificates by the Director-General (Shipping), and then cited the lack of a waiver as\n\nthe excuse for not sharing out the cargo. Because of this, Martin Chen (\"Chen\")\n\nof EMC sent an e-mail on 4 April 2001 to EMC’s agent in Singapore and Colombo\n\ninstructing them to stop booking on HRC vessels until further notice. This e-mail was also\n\nsent to HRC for its comments. HRC responded on 5 April by e-mail to Chen, saying that it\n\ndid not share out the cargo with SCPL because of the refusal of the Director-General to\n\ngrant waivers. HRC claimed that it was for the protection of EMC’s interests that it\n\ndid not load on SCPL’s vessels. Chen forwarded this e-mail to SCPL for its response,\n\nwhich it gave in the form of the offending e-mail of 6 April 2001.9 The Defendants contend that the matter has\n\nlittle or no connection with Singapore because it was published here to only one person\n\nwhereas it was also published in Taipei, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. On the other hand, the\n\nmatter had substantial connection with Bangladesh because:(a) the feeder route involved was the Chittagong-Colombo\n\n    sector;(b) the dispute concerns the interpretation of\n\n    Bangaldeshi legislation;(c) there was litigation pending in Bangladesh in\n\n    respect of the powers of the Director-General (Shipping) with regard to the legislation;(d) HRC is resident in Bangladesh and its reputation is\n\n    mainly in Bangladesh;(e) evidence to prove justification of the statements in\n\n    the e-mail would be more conveniently adduced in Bangladesh than Singapore.",
        "RA 214/2001": "10 The Defendants’ application was heard by the\n\nSenior Assistant Registrar on 26 October 2001. He ruled in favour of the Defendants and\n\nstayed the present action. The Plaintiffs appealed against that decision in RA 214/2001. I\n\nheard the appeal on 17 January 2002 and dismissed it. However in the course of the appeal\n\nthe Plaintiffs had produced the opinion of an expert on Bangladeshi law stating that the\n\ndefamation action could not be maintained in Bangladesh. The Defendants disputed this and\n\nproduced their own expert to depose to the contrary. However I note that the opinion is\n\nnot expressed in unambiguous terms. It states as follows:The Code of Civil Procedure in force in Bangladesh\n\n    provides any dispute including defamation will be adjudicated under the Jurisdiction of\n\n    Bangladesh Courts irrespective of nationality. I have read paragraph 6 of the\n\n    plaintiff’s Statement of Claim in Suit No. 756/2001/E (the Singapore proceedings).\n\n    The allegation is related to Bangladeshi laws and the alleged injury to the plaintiff is\n\n    also within the territory of the Bangladesh. I think this subject matter of dispute should\n\n    be determined in Bangladesh on consideration of relevant oral, documentary and\n\n    circumstantial evidences which are all available in Bangladesh.In view of this, I gave leave to the Plaintiffs to apply\n\nto lift the stay in the event that the Defendants challenge the jurisdiction of the\n\nBangladeshi court or assert there that there is no cause of action in Bangladesh.",
        "The Present Application: SIC 837/2002": "11 The Plaintiffs took out the present application on 21\n\nMarch 2002 to lift the stay in view of certain developments since their appeal was\n\ndismissed in January. These are set out in the affidavit of Foo Say Nong (\"Foo\")\n\nof 19 March 2002. He deposed that shortly after their appeal was dismissed on 17 January\n\n2002, the Plaintiffs commenced an action in the Bangaldeshi court on 7 February. The\n\nPlaintiffs exhibited a copy of the plaint they had filed in the Court of the 5thJoint District Judge, Dhaka which named both the Defendants in the present action as\n\ndefendants. The plaint is on substantially the same terms as the Statement of Claim in\n\nthis action. However on 20 February the Joint District Judge of the 5thCourt\n\nin Dhaka made the following order:This is a suit for defamation and damage. Suit valued at\n\n    Tk. 10 Crore. Advelorem Court fee of Tk. 28,750/- paid with the plaint. Related documents\n\n    photo-copies filed by the plaintiff as per firisti. It appears from the averment made in\n\n    the plaint. That the cause of action arose in Singapore due to Publication of the e-mail\n\n    on 6thApril, 2001. The defendants are also the resident of Singapore and do\n\n    not have any residence or asset in Bangladesh. So, the Court or any Court of Bangladesh do\n\n    not have jurisdiction to proceed with or try with the case as per law. This suit is\n\n    triable in Singapore under relevant law of Singapore.Hence, the plaint be returned to the plaintiffs through\n\n    their learned lawyer for presentation before the proper Court of jurisdiction in\n\n    Singapore.12 In view of the position taken by the 5thDistrict Court of Dhaka, the Plaintiffs made this application to lift the stay ordered by\n\nthe Senior Assistant Registrar on 26 October 2001 which I had affirmed on 17 January 2002.13 The nub of the dispute is whether the e-mail of 6\n\nApril 2001 contains statements defamatory of the Plaintiffs, and if so, whether a defence\n\nof justification can be made out. As to the meaning of the words complained of, there is\n\nno difference whether the suit is heard in Singapore or Bangladesh. On the question of\n\ndamages, the main recipients concerned are the officers of EMC in Taiwan, of RTW Shipping\n\n(S) Pte Ltd in Singapore, and EMC’s office in Sri Lanka. Hence on that point,\n\nBangladesh has no significant advantage over Singapore. Counsel for the Defendants had\n\nstated that the defences available were justification and qualified privilege. It was on\n\nthe defence of justification that substantial advantage could be derived from having the\n\naction heard in Bangladesh as there were issues relating to Bangladeshi legislation, in\n\nparticular whether the ordinance in question was applicable to HRC. The Plaintiffs pointed\n\nout that SCPL had taken out proceedings in the Bangladesh High Court against the\n\nDirector-General (Shipping) which decision would resolve that issue. In determining the\n\nappeal, I was of the view that Bangladesh would be the more appropriate forum as a\n\nquestion of Bangladeshi law would require to be determined. For that reason I dismissed\n\nthe Plaintiffs’ appeal against the stay granted by the Senior Assistant Registrar on\n\n26 October 2001.14 However, the Plaintiffs are now faced with a ruling\n\nof the Bangladeshi court which states that they have no cause of action against the\n\nDefendants in Bangladesh. Counsel for the Defendants pointed out that the Defendants took\n\nno steps to oppose or challenge jurisdiction. That may be true but the fact remains that\n\nit is a decision of the Bangladeshi court. The Plaintiffs had in their first application\n\nfor stay adduced evidence to the effect that they had no cause of action in Bangladesh.\n\nThis was by way of an opinion from their Bangladeshi counsel. However this was\n\ncontradicted by the Defendants’ expert and I had considered that the Plaintiffs had\n\nnot proved their assertion on this point. Now the Plaintiffs have a clear ruling by the\n\nBangladeshi court that they had no cause of action in Bangladesh. To my query, counsel for\n\nthe Defendants was unable to say that there was any evidence of fraud. The plaint\n\nexhibited appears to show substantially what is in the Statement of Claim in the present\n\naction. On the evidence before me, I am satisfied that the Plaintiffs have proved that\n\nthey have no cause of action in Bangladesh.15 Simply put, the Plaintiffs’ case is that not\n\nonly is Bangladesh not the more appropriate forum, it is not even a possible forum. It is\n\nthe Defendants who have to satisfy the court that Bangladesh is the more appropriate\n\nforum. InOriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd[1998] 1 SLR 253the\n\nplaintiff was a trading company based in Singapore and the defendants were an Indian\n\ninsurance company with a registered office in Singapore. The Court of Appeal held at 22\n\nthat:… where a Singapore court has jurisdiction as of\n\n    right, it must be convinced that the foreign court is so clearly and distinctly more\n\n    appropriate that it would justify the court's decision to deny the plaintiffs their day in\n\n    a Singapore court.In the present case the Plaintiffs have commenced\n\nproceedings in Singapore and have properly served the writ on the Defendants here. The\n\nBangladeshi court has decided that it has no jurisdiction. The burden rests on the\n\nDefendants to show that Bangladesh is the more appropriate forum. On the evidence before\n\nme, they have clearly not done so.Sgd:LEE SEIU KINJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERSUPREME COURTCopyright © Government of Singapore."
