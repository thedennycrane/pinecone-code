        "Defendant's claim": "6 Ong claimed that Ng had wrongfully retained a total of $395,228.11 belonging to\n\nthe Plaintiffs. This comprised the following:(i) Profit made by the Plaintiffs in 1993$140,497.50(ii) Profit made by the Plaintiffs in 1994$137,010.61(iii) Deposits collected from tenants of the\n\n          stalls$ 92,100.00(iv) Proceeds received under insurance claim$ 25,620.00Total$395,228.117 Ong prayed for an order that the sum of $395,228.11, or any other sum as the\n\ncourt may find due, be paid by Ng to the Plaintiffs. He also asked for an account of all profits\n\nmade by the Plaintiffs during the period that Ng was managing the Business.",
        "Third Party's defence": "8 In the TPD, Ng essentially pleaded that he had accounted to the Plaintiffs for\n\nall such monies. Ng averred that these sums were received by him in repayment of interest-free\n\nadvances he had made to the Plaintiffs between 1988 and 1991. The advances were as follows:YearAdvance made1988$ 83,130.151988$ 60,181.501989$120,052.421990$ 78,117.161991$ 48,814.84Total:$ 390,296.07The reimbursements for those advances were as follows:(a) Cash payment from Plaintiffs' funds in\n\n        1992:$ 21,658.40(b) Cash payment from Plaintiffs' profits in\n\n        1993:$ 140,497.50(c) Cash payment from Plaintiffs' profits in\n\n        1994:$ 137,010.61(d) Retention of deposits collected from\n\n        tenants:$ 92,100.00Total:$ 391,266.519 In the TPD, Ng acknowledged that he had over-reimbursed himself by $970.44 and\n\nstated that he was prepared to pay this sum to the Receivers. As for the proceeds received under the\n\ninsurance claim, Ng pleaded that he had personally paid the sum of $24,348.00 towards rectification\n\ncosts of the premises following a fire. Upon receipt of the $25,620 from the insurers he reimbursed\n\nhimself the sum he had incurred and paid the balance $1,272.00 into the Plaintiffs' account.",
        "The facts": "10 Ong disputed Ng's defence. In particular he pointed out that according to the\n\naccounts submitted by Ng on the Plaintiffs' behalf to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore, for\n\nthe years 1988 to 1991 their losses totalled only $124,802.15 as follows:YearLoss reported1988$69,559.351989$ 18,963.601990$ 15,311.901991$ 20,967.30Total:$ 124,802.15In view of this, Ong argued, Ng could not have advanced a total of $390,296.07 to\n\nthe Plaintiffs. Ong submitted that Ng should render an account of the monies of the Plaintiffs over\n\nthe entire period that he was in charge of the Business.11 Ng gave evidence of the background to the partnership. He said that sometime\n\nin early 1988 he, Ong and 5 other persons orally agreed to form a partnership to operate the\n\nBusiness. However Ong denied that the other 5 persons were partners. Ong's position was that only he\n\nand Ng were partners and the other 5 persons invested through either him or Ng. But Ng produced a\n\ndocument signed by those 5 persons at a later date which asserted that these 5 persons were also\n\npartners of the Plaintiffs. However it is not necessary for me to determine that issue and I need\n\nonly point this out by way of background. Whatever may have been the exact terms of the agreement\n\nbetween the parties, Ong and Ng were eventually the only partners on record. On the first day of\n\nbusiness on 3 June 1988 Ong was arrested. He was released from prison only in October 1993. Ng\n\nmanaged the Business from that first day until 5 June 1995. Ong took over after that date.12 Ng said in his affidavit that he had been in the coffee shop business for more\n\nthan 20 years. He had a coffee shop at Block 186 in Toa Payoh. He came to know Ong because the\n\nlatter operated a drinks shop at the Toa Payoh hawker centre which was adjacent to Block 186 and\n\nfrequented Ng's coffee shop. On a few occasions Ong expressed an interest in operating a coffee shop\n\nbut said he did not have the capital nor the expertise. Therefore when the opportunity came up to\n\ntender for the premises at Block 180, Ng approached Ong who agreed to participate. Ng estimated that\n\nthey would require about $450,000 for the tender and overheads. They initially agreed to put up\n\n$150,000 each, with the balance to come from the other 5 persons. However eventually Ong could only\n\ncome up with $70,000. Because of this, Ng decreased his share of the capital to $120,000 and the\n\nother 5 persons collectively contributed $140,000, making a total of $330,000. Ong agreed that this\n\nsum was the total capital contribution made. Ng said that this amount was insufficient for the\n\ninitial expenses which eventually came up to $413,130.15 and he had to advance a sum of $83,130.15\n\nto cover the shortfall. Ng exhibited a copy of the opening account from the Plaintiffs' accounting\n\nrecords showing the items constituting the initial expenses totalling $413,130.15. Ong did not\n\nchallenge this document; he merely said that he had no knowledge of it.13 In relation to the accounts for the period June 1988 to December 1991, Ng\n\ntestified that he kept the records in the following manner:(a) The daily takings from the coffee shop were recorded in 2 books, one a soft\n\n  cover and the other a hard cover book. He termed them the \"Daily Account Record (soft\n\n  cover)\" and \"Daily Account Record (hard cover)\".(b) The monthly summaries of the Daily Account Record were recorded in a book\n\n  he called the \"Monthly Account Record\".(c) The rent collected from the other stallholders in the premises were\n\n  recorded in a book he called the \"Rental Account Record\".(d) The yearly summaries of the account records were recorded in a book he\n\n  called the \"Yearly Account Record\".14 The coffee shop was manned in 2 shifts, the first from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. and\n\nthe second from 3 p.m. to midnight. In each shift there were 2 persons and one of them would be a\n\nperson who represented Ng's interests and one who represented Ong's. The persons in each shift would\n\ncollect money on all sales of drinks, food and cigarettes. They would also make cash payments to\n\ntheir suppliers as necessary. At the end of the first shift there would be an informal handing over\n\nof the cash to the persons on the second shift. At the end of that shift, the amount of cash\n\nremaining and expenses paid out would be recorded on the Daily Account Record (soft cover). One of\n\nthe partners, Gan Peck Kiam, was in charge of totalling the figures in the Daily Account Record\n\n(soft cover) and transferring them into the Daily Account Record (hard cover). This was their means\n\nof counter-checking to ensure that the accounts for the day corresponded with the cash collected. As\n\nthere were representatives of both Ng and Ong in each shift, both sides were able to ensure that the\n\nrecords were accurate in respect of each day's operations.15 At the end of each month, Ng extracted the daily figures for takings and\n\nexpenses from the Daily Account Record (hard cover) and transferred them into the Monthly Account\n\nRecord. By adding figures for each day, Ng would arrive at the total takings and cash expenses for\n\nthe month. Ng would also extract figures from other records to prepare the monthly balance sheet.\n\nThe annual accounting statements were also prepared from these records.16 Ng said that after Ong took over the management of the Plaintiffs in June\n\n1995, he left all these records in the office at the premises. Ong denied this, but his evidence on\n\nthis is fraught with contradiction and uncertainty. I preferred the evidence of Ng in this respect\n\nand found that the books concerned were left at the Plaintiffs' premises. In all probability, Ong\n\ndid not check through them before this action was commenced. In any event, the records were with the\n\nReceivers after they took over the matter and Ong had access to them for the purpose of this action.\n\nIf he had wanted to, he could have checked them. He did not do so. On the other hand, I would have\n\nto presume that the Receivers had done so and that they would have taken whatever action they deemed\n\nnecessary to recover any shortfall.17 As for the records kept by Ng, the primary documents are contained in the\n\nDaily Account Record (soft cover). Ng had said that both he and Ong had a representative in each\n\nshift to check on each other and therefore the records of the daily takings and cash expenses would\n\nbe accurate. Ong did not challenge this aspect of the evidence. The other figures, i.e. monthly and\n\nannual statements, are really derived from these primary records and would be purely a matter of\n\narithmetic. On the assumption that the figures in the Daily Account Record were accurately totalled\n\nup in the Monthly Account Record, a task that Ong himself did not seem concerned to verify, I\n\nexamined the monthly and annual tabulations and satisfied myself that the records were correct. I\n\nshould add that while Ng's accounting system would not constitute standard accounting practice, it\n\nwas a simple method devised for a business that probably did not require anything more complex. The\n\nsystem he described was not difficult to understand and would have served its purpose fully. I also\n\nfound that Ng had kept meticulous records of the Business and that Ong had not adduced any evidence\n\nto show otherwise. Nor had Ong given any evidence that such records were not accurate. Ong did not\n\neven refer to these records in his evidence.18 Ong's challenge of the veracity of Ng's records was two-fold and as follows:(i) for the years 1988 to 1992, for the purposes of income tax, Ng had\n\n  submitted accounts to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (\"IRAS\") which showed\n\n  that the losses suffered by the Plaintiffs for those years only totalled $124,802.15, a sum much\n\n  less than the $390,296.07 that he presently claims; and(ii) the gross margins from the operations of the coffee shop were unusually\n\n  low.19 In respect of the accounts to IRAS, Ng said that at that time he got a\n\nbookkeeper whom he knew as \"Kee Wan\" to draw these up for him. He claimed that he was\n\nadvised by \"Kee Wan\" that if he reported the large losses incurred, the IRAS officers\n\nwould query him on his source of funds. He therefore agreed to under-declare the losses for that\n\nperiod. I would have taken a more serious view of this matter if not for the fact that this does not\n\nseem to result in any fraud on the revenue. Indeed, as a result of these under-declarations, the\n\nPlaintiffs would pay a higher amount of tax if they were allowed to off-set past losses against\n\ncurrent profits. Therefore, apart from avoiding the attention, real or imagined, of IRAS officers, I\n\ncould not see what advantage could be gained by Ng in under-declaring the losses. Nor could Ong's\n\ncounsel point out any. In my view, it all boils down to whether the Plaintiffs did incur the losses\n\nas claimed by Ng.20 In relation to the gross margins, Ong produced evidence that under his\n\nstewardship between June 1995 and April 1998 the Plaintiffs achieved a gross margin of 46.9 to\n\n49.9%. His counsel pointed out that for the period 1988 to 1991, based on the IRAS accounts, the\n\nPlaintiffs' gross margin ranged from 35.8 to 38.1%. Under cross-examination, Ng said that a\n\nreasonable gross margin would be 42 to 45%. Counsel therefore submitted that this showed that Ng\n\nmust have made improper withdrawals from the partnership. However this pre-supposes that the IRAS\n\naccounts are accurate. Ng had admitted that they were not and had said that the true records were\n\nthose he had exhibited. According to those records, the gross margin ranged from 38.5% to 50.7%,\n\nwhich figures are not too distant from the margins achieved under Ong.",
        "Conclusion": "21 The only question therefore is whether Ng's explanation as to the fabrication\n\nof the IRAS accounts is credible and whether this court ought to accept it. From his demeanour on\n\nthe stand, I found Ng to be a simple and truthful witness. He candidly agreed about the inaccuracy\n\nof the income figures submitted to IRAS. As I had stated earlier, he had acted on misguided advice\n\nand had not profited from it. On the other hand, Ong had not bothered to examine the accounting\n\nrecords nor had he given any cogent reason why they are not accurate.22 It should be borne in mind that the Plaintiffs had been ordered to be\n\ndissolved and Receivers had been appointed for the purpose of collecting all their assets. The\n\nReceivers are professional accountants and one of their duties was to examine all the accounts and\n\nother records of the Plaintiffs. Indeed that was the very basis for their commencing this action to\n\nrecover the $339,200 from Ong in the main action. The Receivers have not made a similar claim\n\nagainst Ng. I could therefore infer that they were satisfied that the accounts and other records did\n\nnot justify making any claim against him.23 In the premises, I concluded that Ng had told the truth about the accounts. He\n\nhad made the Daily Account Records as well as the other derivative records available to Ong, who had\n\nnot bothered to check them. In the event, I hold that Ng had accounted to Ong in respect of the\n\nBusiness for the period June 1988 to December 1991.24 As Ng had acknowledged that he had over-reimbursed himself by $970.44, one\n\npossible outcome would have been to order him to pay this sum to the Receivers. However counsel for\n\nOng did not ask for such an order. Furthermore, it is a small amount in relation to the sum claimed\n\nby Ong and as Ng had acknowledged this in his TPD, I do not see that the lack of such an order would\n\nhinder the Receivers in any manner in obtaining repayment from Ng. In any event, they can set off\n\nthis sum against whatever proceeds that are due to Ng at the end of the receivership.25 For the reasons above, I dismissed Ong's claim against Ng in this action with\n\ncosts.",
