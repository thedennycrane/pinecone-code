        "The facts": "7.        The proceedings herein\n\narose out of a tragedy. After a quarrel between them at the matrimonial flat (at Block 12\n\nPine Close #12-87) on 29 September 2001 (which the defendant claimed was started by E),\n\nthe defendant stabbed E in the abdomen from which injuries (and resultant haemorrhaging)\n\nshe eventually died. The defendant was originally charged (in Criminal Case No. 10 of\n\n2002) with murder. Subsequently, the charge was amended to manslaughter under s 304(a) of\n\nthe Penal Code Cap 224 to which the defendant pleaded guilty. He was sentenced on 13 March\n\n2002 to 10 years' imprisonment (backdated to 20 September 2001) and 15 strokes of the\n\ncane. He is presently serving his sentence and is tentatively scheduled to be released on\n\n3 June 2008 (on the assumption there isremission of his sentencefor good\n\nbehaviour).8.        Not only did the\n\nplaintiffs file a lengthy first affidavit for their application but supporting affidavits\n\nwere also filed by relatives which included their two (2) daughters, the wives of E's\n\npaternal uncles (2), a paternal aunt and even by the staff nurse (N) on duty at the\n\nemergency department of Tan Tock Seng Hospital where E was taken to on 29 September 2001\n\nafter she was stabbed, and where she eventually succumbed to her injuries.9.        The affidavits filed by\n\nand on the plaintiffs' behalf detailed how the defendant and Ea met, her family's\n\nreservations of their relationship, the events surrounding the parties' Registry marriage\n\nand subsequent Hindu ceremonial wedding, the defendant's short temper and quarrelsome\n\nnature and narrated incidents witnessed by the deponents, where the defendant's propensity\n\nto violence manifested, in particular in assaults on E. The affidavits of the relatives\n\nconcluded that the plaintiffs would be the best persons to have custody of the infant.10.        The defendant's mother as\n\nwell as the defendant filed affidavits to oppose the plaintiffs' application. The\n\ndefendant objected to the plaintiffs having custody of the infant on the basis that it\n\nwould mean the (permanent) loss to him of the child as the plaintiffs had deposed in their\n\naffidavits that they intended to take the infant to and make him a permanent resident of,\n\nAustralia; the plaintiffs well knew it was beyond the defendant's means to commence\n\nproceedings in Australia for the return of the infant years later. The defendant pointed\n\nout that the plaintiffs as the infant's grandparents are'aging' (he surmised they\n\nwere probably in their 60s) and their alternative prayer 3 (that their two (2) daughters\n\nbe appointed the infant's guardians and custodian of the infant) showed that they had no\n\nconfidence of taking care of the infant themselves in the future. The defendant alleged\n\nthat since the birth of the infant, the plaintiffs and other residents at No. 10B Jubilee\n\nRoad had denied him quality/any time with his son. Indeed, they kept him away from the\n\ninfant (to the extent that the plaintiffs took the infant away to Australia to live\n\nwithout his consent) and there was friction between the family members of E and him which\n\nworsened after the infant's birth.11.        The defendant did not\n\ndeny the allegations made by E's family members of disputes between himself and her but\n\ndismissed them as minor tiffs which took place between husband and wife'just like any\n\nother couple'and alleged that the tiffs were made worse when the family members\n\ninterfered. He accused the deponents of painting a picture of him as temperamental while\n\non the other hand they had been very kind and accommodative towards him and alleged it was\n\ntheir interference which led to his present state, not to mention disparaging his mother\n\nto whom they had once turned to, when they had problems and needed help. The defendant\n\ndescribed the allegations regarding his demeanour and behaviour as totally unsubstantiated\n\nand malicious lies.12.        The defendant wanted his\n\nmother to have interim custody of the infant until his release from prison, describing\n\nhimself as'the father who is temporarily separated from [the infant]. He said\n\nhe/his mother are not paupers and have income which would enable them to give the infant a\n\ndecent upbringing. At the very least, his mother would take the trouble to bring his son\n\nto see him while he was in prison.13.        In her affidavit, the\n\ndefendant's mother deposed that her husband had left her (apparently for another woman for\n\nwhom he converted to a Muslim) with three (3) children when the defendant was only five\n\n(5) years old. She had raised her children single handedly thereafter and brought them up\n\nwell. Whilst admitting that her son had done wrong (and for which he was being punished),\n\nthe defendant's mother deposed that she saw no reason why her grandson ought to be\n\npunished by being deprived of his father for the rest of the infant's life. She added that\n\nif Ea's family had been kind and humane, the tragic event which took place could have been\n\naverted.14.        The defendant's mother\n\npointed out that the plaintiffs wanted to take the infant to Australia even though he is a\n\nSingapore citizen by birth; she questioned why the infant should be deprived of his\n\ncitizenship rights. However, she admitted that she herself intended to raise the infant in\n\nIndia but gave her assurance that the infant's Singapore citizenship would not thereby be\n\njeopardized and, that upon his release from jail, the defendant would also maintain the\n\ninfant's Singapore citizenship. She described herself as not poor by the standards of\n\nliving in India (due to her rental income) and with her simple lifestyle, her needs were\n\nmodest. Consequently, every cent of her income would be applied to the well being of the\n\ninfant.15.        Unbeknownst to the\n\nplaintiffs, the defendant's mother and the defendant had separately filed Originating\n\nSummons 650089 of 2002 (the second OS) on 11 April 2002, a week after these proceedings\n\nwere commenced. The present plaintiffs were named the defendants in the second OS wherein\n\nthe defendant and the defendant's mother applied for joint custody of the infant. I would\n\npoint out that the second OS should have been consolidated with this OS or at least, dealt\n\nwith at one and the same time. However, this was not done by either side even though(i) the defendant and the plaintiffs were represented by the same firms\n\n    of solicitors in both proceedings;(ii) the defendant's solicitors entered an appearance to this OS on 15\n\n    April 2002;(iii) the plaintiffs' solicitors entered an appearance to the second OS\n\n    on 30 April 2002 and(iv) the first hearing for this OS was on 8 May 2002 followed by a\n\n    second and final hearing on 6 August 2002.It was a highly unsatisfactory situation with the result that when the\n\nsecond OS was brought to my notice and eventually fixed before me for hearing on 5\n\nSeptember 2002, I had no alternative but to dismiss it, in view of the orders I had\n\nalready made in these proceedings.16.        In the second OS, the\n\ndefendant's mother had filed an affidavit in which she deposed she had a rental income of\n\nrupees 12,000 (S$434-$456) from her home in India; there was no mention of her income of\n\nrupees 30,000 from two (2) other properties although she did depose there was additional\n\nincome derived from her son's own properties. In that affidavit, the defendant's mother\n\nalleged that from the date of his arrest to the date of his conviction and subsequent\n\nincarceration, neither the second plaintiff nor any of her family members had shown the\n\ninfant to the defendant. Further, attempts she made through intermediaries (one of whom\n\nwas her 'disciple' O according to the second plaintiff's second affidavit) to be allowed\n\nto see the infant were rebuffed by the second plaintiff.17.        The affidavit which the\n\ndefendant filed in these proceedings was essentially a rehash of the earlier affidavit he\n\nhad filed in the second OS; there was nothing new save that in his affidavit for the\n\nsecond OS, the defendant deposed that his married sister who lives in Tamil Nadu would\n\nhelp him to take care of the infant. However, unlike the plaintiffs whose daughters\n\naffirmed on affidavit their willingness to take care of the infant if the court should\n\nchoose to appoint them guardians, neither the defendant's sister nor his brother filed any\n\naffidavits in his support. One other additional fact which the defendant deposed to (see\n\npara 19) in his affidavit for the second OS was that as a Hindu, he wanted the infant to\n\nbe brought up by his mother in Indian cultures and traditions. He did not wish the infant\n\nto be taken away to Australia and be brought up in a westernised environment.",
        "The decision": "18.        In the light of the\n\nallegations and cross allegations raised in the affidavits by both sides, I informed\n\ncounsel for the parties that I would be directing the social welfare authorities to\n\ninvestigate into the backgrounds of both parties to help me in my determination. After the\n\nsocial welfare report was ready, the hearing was then restored before me on 6 August 2002,\n\nwhen I made the orders in favour of the plaintiffs.19.        Social welfare reports\n\nmade at the court's behest are confidential and the findings are never revealed to parties\n\nso as to maintain the impartiality and independence of the investigators/department.\n\nConsequently, I cannot/will not reveal the findings of the report made for this case.\n\nHowever, what I can say and which is in any event known to the parties is, that both\n\nplaintiffs as well as the defendant's mother were interviewed for the report and, visits\n\nwere made by welfare officers to No. 10B Jubilee Road and the St George's Lane flat of J.20.        I awarded custody to the\n\nplaintiffs after perusing the social welfare report and taking into consideration s 3 of\n\nthe Guardianship of Infants Act Cap 122 (the Act) which states:Where in any proceedings before any court the custody or\n\n    upbringing of an infant or the administration of any property belonging to or held in\n\n    trust for an infant or the application of the income thereof is in question,the court,\n\n    in deciding that question, shall regard the welfare of the infant as the first and\n\n    paramount considerationand save in so far as such welfare otherwise requires the\n\n    father of an infant shall not be deemed to have any right superior to that of the mother\n\n    in respect of such custody, administration or application nor shall the mother be deemed\n\n    to have any claim superior to that of the father.The highlighted portion of section 3 places the emphasis on the\n\ninfant's welfare as the main consideration in custody proceedings.21.        I noted from the\n\nplaintiffs' lengthy first affidavit that they had taken care of the infant almost\n\ncontinuously since 6 December 2000, three (3) days after his birth.E left the infant with the plaintiffs at\n\nPerth after she visited them in May 2001 and the infant only returned Singapore when the\n\nplaintiffs brought him back for the housewarming ceremony of E's matrimonial flat on 26\n\nSeptember 2001. Indeed, the infant was so attached to them that when the plaintiffs left\n\nhim with E and the defendant for a visit to Malaysia between 17-24 September 2001, E\n\ntelephoned them to return immediately as the infant cried often, looked for them, she had\n\nto work and the defendant was unwilling/unable to look after the infant notwithstanding he\n\nwas unemployed. Thereafter, due to her untimely death three (3) days later, they have (by\n\ndefault) become the infant's sole caregivers albeit with help from loving relatives of\n\ntheir extended family; there is no question that the plaintiffs are totally devoted to the\n\ninfant. The plaintiffs deposed they bore the expenses of the infant's upkeep when he was\n\nin their care and when she was alive, they settled E's debts and the recurrent outgoings\n\nof her matrimonial flat. Even if they did not look down on him (as the defendant alleged),\n\nit was clear from all the affidavits filed by or on the plaintiffs' behalf, that the\n\ndefendant as an in-law, did not meet with the approval of either the plaintiffs or their\n\nrelatives or their extended family.22.        I should also point out\n\nthat in their and in the supporting affidavits, the plaintiffs (and other deponents) dwelt\n\nunnecessarily on the background of the marriage of E to the defendant, his behaviour and\n\nill-treatment of E (even when she was pregnant), why the couple was a mismatch and what\n\nhappened on the day she died. Without meaning any disrespect, dredging up the past will\n\nnot bring E back to life, nor ease the plaintiff's pain of her loss nor is it relevant for\n\npurposes of the present proceedings, save for the defendant's disposition,23.        What was relevant was/is\n\nthe stable relationships and close-knit immediate family of the plaintiffs as well as\n\ntheir extended family and the physical and emotional support they offered one another,\n\nboth in Singapore and in Perth. I compared the plaintiffs' situation with the defendant's.\n\nBeing incarcerated until at least June 2008, he was in no position to exert any rights to\n\ncustody as the natural father of the infant. Further, I was concerned by the fact that the\n\ndefendant did have a propensity to violence and that the infant may one day be on the\n\nreceiving end of that violence. A secondary consideration which I found worrying was his\n\nlack of remorse for stabbing E to death, albeit unintentionally. If he/his mother were to\n\nhave custody/guardianship of the infant, what would he tell the boy when the infant was\n\nold enough to realise and asked, why he did not have a mother like other children. Would\n\nthe defendant explain or be able to explain to the infant how his mother met her demise\n\nand would the child be able to come to terms with the tragedy? My misgivings are based on\n\nthe following paragraphs in the trial judge's grounds of decision in Criminal Case no. 10\n\nof 2002:-29. Even if all the things he alleges about the\n\n    treatment he received from the deceased and her family are true, do they justify or\n\n    mitigate his conduct on 29 Sep 2001 in the new matrimonial home? By then, he had already\n\n    left 10B Jubilee Road some time ago. He and his wife had a place of their own to call\n\n    home. The fact that his wife wanted to go alone to Serangoon Road to meet her mother was\n\n    no great import and would certainly not cause a man to fly into an implacable rage unless\n\n    he is an extremely unreasonable and suspicious sort of person and it is quite apparent\n\n    from the events of that day that the Accused is indeed such a person.30. Even if it were true that his wife had taken the knives from the\n\n    kitchen, shewas not threatening to harm him with the knives in any way. The statement of\n\n    facts and even the Accused’s statement to the psychiatrist show that all the wife\n\n    wanted to do was to get her clothes and leave the flat. She was clearly not about to stab\n\n    or slash him or herself. There was no reason at all for any fierce struggle to take place\n\n    unless the Accused was the aggressor.31. How could a man who, a few moments earlier, stood submissively clad\n\n    in a towel while his wife clawed ferociously at his unprotected flesh suddenly become so\n\n    overcome by anger and rage over a cut inflicted unintentionally in the course of a\n\n    struggle precipitated by himself that he would wrest the knife away and plunge it twice\n\n    into his wife’s abdomen? Why would a man determined to thwart any attempt at suicide\n\n    stab his wife not once but twice in such a violent manner? The chain of events points to\n\n    the Accused being the aggressor on 29 Sep 2001.32. I am also not convinced that he experienced ‘intense\n\n    remorse’ after the stabbing. He was more fearful and anxious about the consequences\n\n    of his actions than he was remorseful. This is shown by the fact that he maintained that\n\n    his wife had stabbed herself until confronted with the forensic report the next day.24.        So the question really\n\nwas, should the maternal grandparents or his paternal grandmother be the infant's\n\nguardians? I decided that it should be the plaintiffs as I was certain they could offer\n\nthe infant a better life (in all aspects) than the defendant's mother.25.        In contrast to the\n\nplaintiffs (the second plaintiff has operated a school in Perth for almost 20 years\n\nteaching classical Indian dancing and music while the first plaintiff is a classical\n\nmusician who plays the 'tabla' and 'sitar' instruments), the defendant's mother can only\n\nbe said to have an unorthodox vocation, whether one describes it as religious teaching,\n\nfortune telling or soothsaying. I cannot imagine that she can offer a better environment\n\nto the infant during his tender years than the plaintiffs; indeed it would be the\n\nopposite. As she and her disciples had deposed to in their affidavits, she visits\n\nSingapore and Malaysia often. What would happen to the infant during those frequent\n\nvisits? Would she bring him along on her trips or would she leave him behind in India? If\n\nthe latter scenario is to be the case, who would be taking care of the infant during her\n\nabsence? It was not possible for our social welfare authorities to extend their inquiries\n\nand investigations to Chennai, Tamil Nadu, where the defendant's mother (and his two [2]\n\nsiblings live). I have no inkling what her living conditions in India are like. Indeed, no\n\ninformation was forthcoming from the defendant or his mother in that respect. If, as the\n\ndefendant's mother deposed in her affidavit, she rents out her property in India, where\n\ndoes she live? In the interests of the infant, I could not take a risk and allow the\n\ndefendant's mother to raise the infant in conditions unknown.26.        Granted that the first\n\nand second plaintiffs are 62 and 56 years old respectively, whereas the defendant's mother\n\nis relatively younger at 46 years of age. Are the plaintiffs' older ages relevant to the\n\nissue of the infant's guardianship as the defendant had asserted in his affidavit? If that\n\nfactor was taken in isolation I would agree but in this case, there were other\n\nconsiderations which compensated for that disadvantage as it were, namely, the support\n\nfrom and the closeness of the extended family which the plaintiffs had/have, both in Perth\n\nand in Singapore, which was sorely lacking on the defendant's side of the family. It is\n\nnot possible for any court to look that far ahead and predict what would happen to the\n\ninfant when the plaintiffs enter the twilight years of their lives; one can only determine\n\nwhat is best for the infant under current conditions and in the near future.27.        Finally, I did consider\n\nbut dismissed, the defendant's objections that he did not want the infant to be brought up\n\nin a westernised environment (Perth). The plaintiffs were very much involved on a regular\n\nif not daily basis, with classical Indian music, dancing and instruments. What could be\n\nmore traditional than those activities? They, their immediate and extended families came\n\nacross as traditional Indians, as reflected in the fact that the defendant and E underwent\n\na Hindu temple ceremony after the Registry wedding. The defendant's objections were\n\ntotally baseless. Being resident in a western country does not mean that a person\n\nautomatically loses his culture and traditions, it all depends on an individual's personal\n\nbeliefs.28.        Every case on\n\ncustody/guardianship turns on its own facts. I decided that the facts in this case\n\nwarranted that the plaintiffs, not the defendant or his mother, should have guardianship\n\nof the infant and raise him in Perth, bearing in mind the considerations set out in s 3 of\n\nthe Act.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
