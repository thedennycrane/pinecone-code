        "Introduction": "1 This action was the second action filed by the plaintiffs (“Plaintiffs”) against the defendant, Chen Weiping (“Chen”), as guarantor of the obligations of Midas Holdings Limited (“Midas”). It was similar to the first action in Suit No 420 of 2018 filed by the Plaintiffs against Chen. The first action was in respect of “the Series 003 Notes” issued by Midas. The second action was in respect of “the Series 004 Notes” issued by Midas. 2 The background to the second action was the same as that to the first action. 3 On 7 November 2018, the Plaintiffs filed Summons No 5242 of 2018 for summary judgment against Chen. 4 On 4 December 2018, the Plaintiffs and Guo Bingqiang filed Summons No 5698 of 2018 to strike out the counterclaim by Chen against them. 5 Likewise, on 4 December 2018, Patrick Chew filed Summons No 5705 of 2018 to strike out Chen’s counterclaim against him and Summons No 5703 of 2018 to set aside Chen’s Third Party Notice against him.
