        "The decision of the court": "18        Assuming the alleged collateral agreement existed, it was difficult to see why non-fulfilment of any or all of its terms should render the guarantee void. No provision for such a draconian result was shown in evidence. The defendant’s remedy for any breach of its terms would be damages and not avoidance of the guarantee. 19        In the many discussions and negotiations between the parties’ representatives leading to the tenancy agreement and the guarantee, the only document relied on for the contention that a collateral agreement existed was a presentation paper dated 27 March 1998 in which the plaintiff stated its plans to upgrade Liang Court and to bring in new tenants. That paper was no more than a marketing tool and was not intended to contain contractual undertakings. At most, the statements therein would amount to representations made by the plaintiff. 20        The representations as to the plans to upgrade the shopping complex and to bring in new tenants were not false. The plaintiff did do upgrading works in November 2000. The defendant would have liked the plaintiff to do even more, such as those undertaken at Plaza Singapura, but upgrading is surely a matter of degree. It could even be argued that extensive upgrading works might actually discourage visitors because of the attendant dirt and dust and necessary closure of many portions of the shopping complex while such works are being carried out. That would definitely affect the business of a restaurant adversely. 21        The plaintiff also brought in new retail outlets such as Starbucks, McDonalds, SAFE Superstore, Bossini, B.U.M. Equipment and Charles & Keith. Admittedly, they did not occupy significantly large premises to qualify them as anchor or mini-anchor tenants but they definitely were neither insignificant nor unsubstantial tenants. The defendant alleged, however, that the plaintiff promised that Dive Restaurant, another theme restaurant emanating from the USA, would also be a tenant in Liang Court. Dennis Chiu, a director of both the defendant and the tenant, testified that it was because of such a representation that he travelled to Los Angeles to see that theme restaurant for himself. 22        I accepted the plaintiff’s evidence that any talk about Dive Restaurant related to that restaurant being a possible alternative theme restaurant to Rainforest Café. The plaintiff could not have promised that Dive Restaurant would be a tenant as well. If it did, surely questions would have been asked by the defendant about when that restaurant would be coming in, where it would be located in Liang Court and how much space it would be taking up. This is because while Dive Restaurant might add to the atmosphere of theme restaurants there, it would obviously be a competitor to Rainforest Café as well. The fact that the defendant led no evidence on such details showed that no such promise was made by the plaintiff. 23        Dennis Chiu could have decided to visit Dive Restaurant in Los Angeles for many reasons not related to any such alleged promise. The defendant and the tenant did not raise the issue of the absence of Dive Restaurant for the period of more than two years that the Rainforest Café was operating in Liang Court. What was even more telling was that no protest was made about breaches of the collateral agreement even after the letter of demand was sent in October 2002. The defendant’s Hong Kong solicitors raised a number of grounds for denying liability under the guarantee but breach of the alleged collateral agreement was not one of them. 24        While increasing human traffic would be of concern to any landlord of a shopping complex and the plaintiff had its plans for such, it was the defendant which in July 1998 sought to persuade the plaintiff that it would be worth its while to contribute $3m towards the fitting-out works for the Rainforest Café because the theme restaurant had great potential in attracting human traffic to Liang Court for the parties’ mutual benefit. It was not a case of a potential tenant wishing to go into the shopping complex only if there would be increased human traffic. The potential tenant was marketing itself to the landlord as the crowd-puller. 25        Some feeble protest was also raised by the defendant in evidence about Daimaru, the then anchor tenant, down-sizing its premises. The defendant claimed it was not told about this. However, it was patently clear that Rainforest Café would be occupying part of the premises of Daimaru which the departmental store would be giving up for the theme restaurant. 26        The other collateral promise alleged was that of co-operating to ensure that both parties could recoup their investments. The plaintiff mooted the idea of a “partnership” with the tenant to create a situation beneficial to both landlord and tenant. It was never meant to be a partnership in the strict legal sense and the defendant did not allege such. The defendant claimed that this entailed the landlord being forgiving towards tenants who were unable to pay their rent on time, as was the plaintiff’s apparent attitude towards the other tenants in Liang Court. 27        The guarantee was clear in its terms that a demand could be made if there was a breach of the tenancy agreement. While the plaintiff would be happy to co-operate with the defendant and the tenant, it would surely be unreasonable to expect the landlord to keep forgiving the tenant’s failure to meet its financial obligations especially when, as was the case here, the arrears exceeded the amount of the deposit held by the landlord. That would not be co-operation – it would be unilateral sacrifice. It was not as if the plaintiff was deliberately seeking to destroy the theme restaurant. It would have been extremely pleased to see it become a huge success as the high turnover rent would then help it recoup its financial outlay quickly. 28        It was remarkable that the collateral agreement, important as it was to the defendant and the tenant, was never recorded in writing. On the evidence, I saw no collateral agreement as alleged and certainly no breach even if there was such an agreement. 29        The arguments on the alleged condition precedent may be disposed of quite simply by referring to the unambiguous language of the guarantee. The words “up to” before the stipulated amount of $3.2m, in their ordinary and natural meaning, set the maximum contribution that the plaintiff was to make to the fitting-out works. The final amount contributed by the plaintiff could well be less than but close to $3.2m but the words did not mean “exactly” or “close to”. There was the possibility of a cost-overrun or of over-budgeting but the plaintiff was not to be asked to contribute anything above $3.2m. Similarly, under the terms of the guarantee, the plaintiff could only recoup the actual amount contributed less whatever turnover rent it received from the tenant. At any rate, even if the plaintiff’s actual contribution was only $2.725m out of $3.2m, that would be 85% of the maximum and it seems to me that 85% is pretty “close to” 100%. 30        The plaintiff’s final computation of the amount owing by the defendant was $2,837,821.81 derived in the following manner. The landlord’s contribution to the tenant’s works comprised $2,475,447.63 (payment of the progress claim), $189,260 (payment to Ban Chuan View) and $250,886.97 (rental arrears agreed to be set off) and $249,000 (landlord’s works). From the sum of these four amounts, the plaintiff deducted $55,768.32 (payment from the tenant) and $271,004.47 (turnover rent received). The discrepancies in the amount claimed by the plaintiff were due to the fact that the documents had to be retrieved from the warehouse and the figures were updated as more documents were studied. There was also some initial confusion that the amount guaranteed was $3.2m and not the actual amount contributed by the plaintiff. 31        The summary of claims made by the tenant and the payments made by the plaintiff[1]showed that the tenant agreed that the payment to Ban Chuan View and the rental arrears were to be deducted from the landlord’s contribution. The tenant had claimed a total of $2,938,435 and was paid only $2,475,447, leaving a balance of almost $463,000. The tenant agreed to a set-off of the two items so that the plaintiff did not need to pay the tenant and then ask for the return of almost the same sum. The Ban Chuan View invoice was for work done to create a void in the premises. That work was part of the landlord’s as well as the tenant’s works as defined in the Third Schedule of the tenancy agreement. Ban Chuan View carried out structural works for the plaintiff and the tenant under separate contracts. Accordingly, it was agreed that the plaintiff would “absorb” $41,600 of the $189,260 as the landlord’s works while the rest would go towards the tenant’s works. Ultimately, the payment was made for the fitting-out works for the theme restaurant. Similarly, the set-off of the rental arrears was against the claims made by the tenant already. Therefore, it could not be said that these two amounts were not part of the works contemplated in the tenancy agreement or that the said agreement had been varied. 32        The defendant argued, however, that any agreement on the set-off between the plaintiff and the tenant did not bind the defendant. This could not be correct because the payments were actually for the works contemplated in the tenancy agreement and were not extraneous expenses added on to increase the defendant’s financial exposure. The defendant was the ultimate parent company of the tenant. Dennis Chiu was a director of both the defendant and the tenant. As he said in court, it was not possible for him to separate his corporate personalities when dealing with the tenancy matters in issue. The defendant was the guarantor for the tenant. It could not be seriously argued that the defendant was not aware of what the tenant was doing. 33        The defendant was not able to produce credible evidence to challenge the plaintiff’s computation of the turnover rent paid. The payment vouchers produced by Dennis Chiu, purportedly for turnover rent paid after October 2001, did not show that they were payments for turnover rent. Dennis Chiu had no personal knowledge of such payments. 34        The defendant further contended that a demand made under the guarantee had to be precise in its amount before it could be valid. If it was not precise, the defendant argued, it would never know what its actual liability was. 35        Here, the certificate enclosed with the letter of demand of 25 October 2002 could not be final and conclusive as to the amount of the debt due as it was shown to be manifestly erroneous by the plaintiff, the issuer of the certificate. A demand to a guarantor is generally valid if it makes clear to him that the creditor requires payment of a sum which is actually due: Phillips and O’Donovan, The Modern Contract of Guarantee(2nd Ed, 1992) at 421. It is not essential to the validity of a notice calling up a debt that it correctly states the amount of the debt: see Walton J inBank of Baroda v Panessar[1987] Ch 335at 346–347, following the High Court of Australia inBunbury Foods Pty Ltd v National Bank of Australasia Ltd(1984) 51 ALR 609 on this point. The High Court of Australia held that a notice demanding payment of loan moneys which did not specify the amount then owing by the debtor company was valid. Similarly, Walton J in theBank of Barodacase held that a demand for “all moneys due to us” was valid where a creditor was entitled by the terms of his security to demand repayment of all moneys thereby secured. 36        I agree with these cases. In my view, the letter of demand of 25 October 2002 was a valid demand under the guarantee although it was erroneous as to the amount owing. There could be no prejudice to the defendant in any event as the amount stated was less than the actual amount owing. The call on the guarantee within the stipulated period attached liability while the certificate merely stated the quantum payable or the extent of the liability. The formula for determining the extent of the liability was provided in the guarantee and the defendant, as the ultimate parent company of the tenant and both companies having at least one common director, had the means of determining the precise amount itself. Even if the amount owing was found to be less than the amount claimed in the letter of demand, that should not be an impediment to a court giving judgment for the smaller amount and making an appropriate order as to costs of the action. I found here that the defendant was liable for at least the smaller amount of $2,616,810 claimed in the letter of demand of 25 October 2002. I was also satisfied that the actual amount owing to the plaintiff was the larger amount claimed in its revised computation in court. 37        Distress is premised on an affirmation of the landlord-tenant relationship: Gray,Elements of Land Law(2nd Ed, 1993) at 841. It is an affirmation that the tenancy continues to subsist and it follows that execution of a writ of distress does not determine a tenancy. This statement is subject to what I have to say below. In this case, the bailiff testified that the tenant’s officials were told by him that they could continue to operate the restaurant so long as the seized goods were not removed from the tenanted premises and that if the rental arrears were paid up, the seizure would be lifted. However, the defendant contended that the tenant could not continue with its business as the merchandise in the retail section had been seized and was locked up in the storeroom. It argued that since the retail section at the entrance could not operate, it gave the impression to potential customers that the restaurant on the upper level was closed. 38        There was nothing to prevent the tenant from placing notices and staff at the entrance to inform potential patrons that the restaurant was still open. Indeed, part of the concept of the Rainforest Café was that patrons be given a passport and be called to enter the restaurant when their turn arrived. For this purpose, there would have to be staff manning the entrance at all times anyway. They could also easily inform patrons that the retail section was temporarily closed. Dennis Chiu, in response to the court’s question, estimated that the retail section accounted for some 20% to 25% of Rainforest Café’s income. Even if this was correct, the restaurant was still clearly the mainstay of the business. The retail section was an added attraction but it was not crucial to Rainforest Café’s operations. That was evident even from the name. The space at the retail section was still available for use by the tenant. In law and in fact, therefore, the writ of distress did not terminate the tenancy. 39        However, by 31 July 2002, when lotting of the goods seized was done and the locks were changed, it would be highly unrealistic to say that the tenancy continued despite the writ of distress. The tenant could not run its business any more – indeed, it was not permitted to do so at the premises in question. It was, for all practical purposes, thrown out of the tenanted premises while its goods were seized and locked up inside. I therefore held that the tenancy was terminated on 31 July 2002. 40        The demand made on 25 October 2002 was therefore within the three-month validity period provided in the guarantee. As the only validly-claimed amount within that period was the lesser amount of $2,616,810, I limited judgment for the plaintiff to that amount. I also awarded the plaintiff contractual interest at 8% per annum with monthly rests on the amounts disbursed from the respective dates of disbursement. 41        On 23 October 2003, the plaintiff made an offer to settle at $2.3m without interest to be paid by the defendant within 14 days together with indemnity costs. As I was of the view that cl 1 of the guarantee did not provide clearly for indemnity costs, the judgment was therefore more favourable to the plaintiff than the offer to settle in terms of the amount awarded but was less favourable to the plaintiff in terms of the basis of costs as the general rule is to award costs on the standard basis: O 59 r 27 of the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R 5, 1997 Rev Ed). Originally, I intended to deduct a certain portion of costs on the matters that the plaintiff was not successful in. However, in view of the offer to settle, I made no such deduction and awarded costs to the plaintiff at 100% on the standard basis. Plaintiff’s claim allowed with costs. [1]At 2 AB 537."
