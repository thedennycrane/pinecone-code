        "(i) The Trustees’ costs": "4. The first order applied for by Mr Wee was a declaration that the\n\nTrustees were only entitled to charge an administrative fee for work done for the period 1\n\nJanuary 1998 to 30 July 1999 (date of the order of court) amounting to $2,399.07 (ie\n\n$1,515.21 for 1998 plus $883.85 pro-rated for the period from 1 January 1999 to 30 July\n\n1999). The essence of this prayer was that Mr Wee did not accept the manner in which the\n\nTrustees had calculated the fees due to themselves and asserted that if these were\n\ncorrectly calculated the amount due would total only $2,399.07.5. On 30 July 1999, I had made an express order allowing the Trustees\n\nto be remunerated for their work in accordance with their then current standard scale of\n\ncharges. This remuneration order was made retrospective to 25 August 1997. The\n\nTrustees’ then standard scale of charges had come into operation on 1 January 1994\n\nand it provided that the Trustees were entitled to be paid an administration fee of one\n\npercent of the gross value of the assets under administration.6. The Trustees had furnished their Revised Tax Invoices to Mr\n\nWee’s solicitors in October 2001. By these invoices the Trustees charged\n\nadministrative and investment fees of $42,964.78 for the year 1998 and $28,391.10 for the\n\nfirst six months of 1999 on the basis that these sums were equivalent to one percent (1%)\n\nof the gross value of the trust fund. The bulk of the charges arose from the\n\nTrustees’ valuation of the property no. 16 Mohamed Sultan Road (‘the\n\nproperty’) as being worth $3 million.7. Mr Wee objected to the charges. His grounds were as follows:(1) the property was impressed with the Sinchew trust until 30 July\n\n  1999. It was in a dilapidated state and had not been maintained by the Trustees;(2) the property had not generated income for a long time because it\n\n  was impressed with the trust and therefore the Trustees’ assertion that the open\n\n  market value of the property was $3 million based on a valuation done in May 1997 could\n\n  not be correct as no prudent purchaser would be prepared to pay $3 million for a\n\n  dilapidated rent controlled property impressed with a Sinchew trust;(3) the trust accounts furnished by the Trustees for the period from\n\n  July 1957 to 31 December 1999 showed that the capital value of the property was only\n\n  $16,000. The Trustees had taken the value of the property to be $3 million so as to\n\n  inflate the value of the trust and produce tax invoices on the inflated value;(4) the Trustees’ Balance Sheet and Capital Account for the year\n\n  ended 1998 showed the administrative, discretionary and investment fees to total only\n\n  $1,515.21 yet by the year ended 1999 the fees had escalated to the astronomical figure of\n\n  $51,945.99. At best, the Trustees were entitled $1,515.21 as their fees for 1998 and a sum\n\n  of $883.85 (pro-rated for seven months) for the period 1 January 1999 to 30 July 1999.8. The Trustees’ stand was that they were entitled to calculate\n\ntheir charges on the basis that the gross value of the property was $3 million in 1998 and\n\nthe first half of 1999. They relied on a valuation report dated 19 May 1997 issued by\n\nChesterton International Property Consultants Pte Ltd. In this report, the valuers had\n\nopined that the open market value of the property, with vacant possession and free from\n\nencumbrances, was $3 million and that the open market value of the property, subject to a\n\nrent controlled tenancy at a rental of $49.40 per month, was $2.9 million. It should be\n\nnoted that at the material times, the property was vacant.9. The Trustees also clarified why their fees had been shown as\n\n$1,515.21 in their Balance Sheet and Capital Account for the year 1998 and had apparently\n\nescalated to an astronomical fee of $51,945.99 in mid June 1999. The reason that there was\n\nan increase in the administrative fee in 1999 was due to an accounting entry. In December\n\n1998, the administrative fee for the year 1998 had yet to accrue as the Trustees were\n\nwaiting for the decision of the High Court in respect of the fees payable for\n\nadministration of the Sinchew trust before charging these fees. It was only after that\n\ndecision was given and the Trustees were entitled to charge, with retrospective effect, a\n\nfee of one percent of the gross assets, that the fees were correctly assessed and then\n\nincluded in the June 1999 accounts.10. I accepted the Trustees’ argument that they were entitled to\n\nvalue the property at $3 million as this was the open market value given to it by a\n\nreputable valuer. The fact that the property was dilapidated had already been taken into\n\naccount in the valuation which described the general state of repair of the property to be\n\npoor as at the time of the inspection by the valuers in 1997. Further, the fact that the\n\nproperty was subject to the Sinchew trust was irrelevant to the valuation as the valuers\n\nwere asked to value the property on an open market basis. The Trustees’ standard\n\nscale of charges allowed them to charge on the basis of ‘gross value of assets under\n\nadministration’. Although the term ‘gross value’ was not defined in the\n\nscale, I considered that it should be given its ordinary meaning and that in this context,\n\nthe Trustees were entitled to equate gross value with open market value on an unencumbered\n\nbasis. If encumbrances were to be taken into account, the value given would be a net value\n\nrather than a gross value. On this basis, it was my opinion that Mr Wee had no ground to\n\nassert that the proper fee for the period from 1 January 1998 to 30 July 1999 was\n\n$2,399.07. Accordingly, I made no order on his first prayer.(ii) Payment of interest to Mr Wee11. Mr Wee’s second prayer was for the following:‘that the Plaintiffs as trustees of the Will of the Testator be\n\n  ordered :(a) to pay the balance of such capital and income standing to the\n\n    credit of the estate (after deduction of their fees amounting to $2,399-07) to the\n\n    solicitors for the 5thDefendant forthwith which is only to be released to the\n\n    5thDefendant after payment of the Plaintiffs’ solicitors’ taxed\n\n    costs.(b) to pay interest on such capital sum and income to the solicitors\n\n    for the 5thDefendant at 6% per annum(i) on the total sum standing to the credit of the 5thDefendant for the period 30thJuly 1999 to 21stSeptember 2001.(ii) on the balance (after deduction of $400,000 paid to the 5thDefendant on 21stSeptember 2001) for the period 22ndSeptember 2001\n\n      to the date of payment.’12. Mr Wee asserted that once it was clear from the order of court of\n\n30 July 1999 that the capital and income held by the Trustees were held on trust for him,\n\nthe Trustees had two options. They could have:(a) released the monies due to him to his solicitors immediately after\n\n  the date of the court order subject to the retention of a reasonable sum to meet their\n\n  invoices and their solicitors’ taxed costs in relation to the originating summons; or(b) released the monies due to him to his solicitors immediately after\n\n  the date of the court order subject to his solicitors’ undertaking to retain a\n\n  reasonable sum to meet their invoices and their solicitors’ taxed costs.13. The Trustees did not pursue either option. Mr Wee stated that he\n\nhad been deprived of the use of the trust funds for more than two years. The Trustees only\n\nreleased part of the trust funds ($400,000) to him on 21 September 2001. He asserted that\n\nthe Trustees as professional trustees were obliged to account to him for the interest lost\n\non the trust funds between the date of the court order and payment of part of the trust\n\nfunds to him as follows:(a) on the total sum standing to his credit for the period 30 July 1999\n\n  to 21 September 2001; and(b) on the balance (after deduction of $400,000) for the period 22\n\n  September 2001 to the date of payment.14. In response the Trustees referred to the order of court made on 18\n\nApril 2000 whereby I had ordered them to pay the capital and income of the trust to Mr Wee\n\nafter deduction of their remuneration upon being furnished the necessary account details\n\nby Mr Wee. They had then proceeded to tax the legal costs of the solicitors for the other\n\ndefendants in the main action (as these costs were payable by the fund) and when this was\n\ncomplete had tried to release funds to Mr Wee. They had not been successful because Mr Wee\n\nhad not given them the necessary account details.15. The Trustees referred to a letter dated 24 August 2000 to Mr\n\nWee’s solicitors from their solicitors whereby they had enquired when Mr Wee expected\n\nthe Trustees to hand over to him the assets and files in respect of the trust. There was\n\nno reply to this letter. By a subsequent letter dated 7 September 2000, the Trustees’\n\nsolicitors asked for Mr Wee’s instructions as to how he proposed the assets should be\n\ntransferred. There was no reply to this enquiry either. On 30 November 2000, the Trustees\n\nwere informed by their solicitors that Mr Wee’s solicitors had no instructions to\n\naccept payment of funds on Mr Wee’s behalf.16. I considered that as far as those assets of the trust which were\n\nheld in cash were concerned, the Trustees did not need account details in order to make\n\npayment to Mr Wee. They could easily have sent him a draft for the amount due via his\n\nsolicitors. The only uncertainty was the amount payable since the Trustees’\n\nsolicitors’ bill for the main action had not been finalised. The estimated amount of\n\nthis payable could, however, have been deducted and the balance paid out to Mr Wee as\n\nindeed was done in September 2001. By the time of the hearing, however, the taxation of\n\nthis bill was imminent. It was, therefore, pointless to make another payment less\n\nretention of the estimated amount of the bill. Accordingly, I made an order that the\n\nTrustees should pay the balance of the capital and income to the solicitors for Mr Wee\n\nforthwith upon conclusion of the taxation of that bill.17. I was informed by the Trustees’ solicitors that as at 30 July\n\n1999, the Trustees had held cash in the amount of $775,516.40 on trust for Mr Wee. As of\n\nthe date of the hearing, the Trustees’ bill totalled $128,495.84 and the\n\nsolicitors’ bill for taxation came up to $113,000. Thus the expenses to be deducted\n\nfrom the cash amounted to $241,495.84 and the balance payable to Mr Wee as at that date\n\nwas approximately $534,020.56. Out of this $400,000 had already been sent to Mr Wee.18. Since it was my view that the Trustees should have paid whatever\n\ncould reasonably be estimated to be due to Mr Wee on 18 April 2000 forthwith upon the\n\nmaking of the court order and that they had no reasonable excuse for delaying this\n\npayment, I agreed with Mr Wee’s counsel that interest would have to be paid in\n\nrelation to the delay. The question was what was the correct amount of interest. Mr Wee in\n\nhis application had asked for six percent per annum. That seemed to me to be unduly high\n\nbearing in mind current low interest-rate levels for savings and fixed deposit accounts.\n\nFurther, the Trustees would have earned only a one percent fee on the value of the assets\n\n(though of course they were not entitled to charge that fee in respect of assets that\n\nshould have been paid over since the assets were no longer theirs to be managed) and they\n\nhad acted in good faith, albeit in a rather lackadaisical fashion in that they had waited\n\nto be told what to do rather than taken the initiative. In view of these circumstances, I\n\nconsidered that it would be sufficient to order them to pay interest calculated at the\n\nrate of one half of one percent on the amount that should have been paid earlier. I\n\ntherefore made the following orders:(1) the plaintiffs [the Trustees] shall pay the fifth defendant [Mr\n\n  Wee] interest of half percent per annum on the following sums:(a) the sum of $400,000 from 18 April 2000 to 21 September 2001; and(b) the sum of $134,000 from 18 April 2000 up to the date of payment of\n\n    the principal sum.(2) the above interest payments have been calculated on the basis that\n\n  the plaintiffs’ bills as presented are correct and in accordance with their scale\n\n  fees.19. The final issue was one of costs. Each party had succeeded on one issue and failed\n\non another. I therefore ordered that each party should bear its/his own costs and that for\n\nthe avoidance of doubt the plaintiffs/Trustees should not deduct their costs in relation\n\nto the application from the estate.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGEThis does not merit reporting.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
