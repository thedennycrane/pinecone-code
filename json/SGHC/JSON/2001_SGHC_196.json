        "The facts": "2. This was a claim by the plaintiff (Yuninshing) against the defendant (Mondong)\n\nfor damages of US$530,000 arising from an alleged breach of a foreign exchange contract.3. Both parties are Indonesian nationals; they are also related in that Mondong\n\nis the uncle of Yuninshing. The claim arose out of an oral agreement reached in a conversation\n\nbetween the parties sometime in June 1999, at the home of Yuninshings parents in Surabaya,\n\nIndonesia. At that time, Yuninshing desired to buy US dollars to deposit into her Singapore account,\n\nwhile Mondong wished to convert US dollars in Singapore to Indonesian Rupiahs in his Jakarta\n\naccount. It struck them that by entering into a direct exchange agreement, they would save on the\n\nexchange rate in the open forex market.4. The arrangement worked well initially and transactions took place between June\n\n1999 to mid-November 1999 without any problems. During this period, Yuninshing remitted sums in\n\nIndonesian Rupiahs (IR) from her accounts with Bank Central Asia and Bank Danamon in Surabaya, to\n\nMondongs accounts in the Jakarta branches of the respective banks. In return, Mondong would\n\nusually fax her a telegraphic transfer application form showing the corresponding remittance in US\n\ndollars into her Singapore account with Republic Central Bank (RCB) or N M Rothschild & Sons\n\n(Rothschilds). Such telegraphic transfers were done via Thomas Cook Travel Services Pte Ltd\n\n(Thomas Cook), HBZ International Exchange (HBZ), and Christiana Bank, Singapore (Christiana Bank),\n\ndepending on which had the most attractive prevailing rate, and also via Dutair & Sea Cargo\n\nServices Pte Ltd (Dutair Singapore), a company controlled by Mondong. On certain occasions, when\n\nMondong had bank-notes to exchange, cash payments in US dollars would also be made to Yuninshings\n\nrepresentive, Mr Ko Ahok, in Jakarta.5. The subject of Yuninshings claim was the following two sums of monies which\n\nwere deposited into Mondongs account:(a) IR 2,047,400,000 (equivalent to US$290,000), deposited on 25 November 1999;\n\n  and(b) IR 1,722,000,000 (equivalent of US$240,000), deposited on 29 November 1999.6. After these deposits were made, Mondong faxed to Yuninshing two telegraphic\n\ntransfer application forms from Thomas Cook indicating the remittance of the sums into her\n\nRothschilds account. However, the plaintiff was later informed by Rothschilds and Thomas Cook\n\nthat no such remittances had been made. Yuninshing therefore claimed that Mondong had failed to\n\nremit to her account the sum of US$530,000, equivalent to IR 3,769,400,000, which was the combined\n\ntotal of the two deposits.7. Yuninshing filed this claim against Mondong on 7 August 2000. The first round\n\nof proceedings was however largely unfruitful. Mondong entered an appearance on 25 September 2000\n\nand took out an application for inter alia, a declaration that the Singapore courts had no\n\njurisdiction to hear the matter. The application was allowed by the learned Assistant Registrar on 9\n\nJanuary 2001, but the order was subsequently set aside by consent on 30 January 2001 (in Registrars\n\nAppeal No. 9 of 2001).8. In the second round of proceedings that followed, Mondong sought, inter alia,\n\na stay of proceedings on the ground that Singapore was not the appropriate forum to try the matter.\n\nThe application was heard by the learned Assistant Registrar on 28 March 2001. She refused to grant\n\na stay on the ground offorum non conveniensand ordered costs against Mondong. It was\n\nagainst her decision (which I affirmed) that Mondong lodged the present appeal.",
        "Preliminary Issues": "9. There were three preliminary issues which I took into consideration in\n\ndetermining this appeal:(a) Firstly, Mondong had in the interim commenced legal proceedings in the\n\n  District Court of Surabaya on 19 March 2001 (Register Case Number: 141/Pdt.G/2001/PN). In those\n\n  proceedings, he claimed that he had overpaid Yuninshing and that it was the latter who in fact\n\n  owed him IR 1,250,450,000 from the series of transactions. The Surabaya action was however quite\n\n  inexplicably revoked upon Mondongs request on 11 April 2001.(b) Secondly, it was noteworthy that the Surabaya proceedings constituted the\n\n  conclusion of a series of vacillating defences advanced by Mondong. These defences were relevant\n\n  as they indicated the type of evidence required in the main action itself.10. Initially, Mondong claimed that he had made part payment of US$450,000 out of\n\nthe US$530,000 in the following manner:Date Payment Amount25 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$100,00030 Nov 99 Cash payment to Mr Ko Ahok US$30,00030 Nov 99 Deposit into bank US$200,00002 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$100,00002 Dec 99 Deposit into bank US$20,00011. He admitted that he had failed to remit the remaining US$80,000 as his\n\ncourier was apprehended by the Indonesian Customs authorities and fined as a result.12. Yuninshing however contended that these cash payments and deposits were in\n\nrespect of previous remittances and not the present claim in question. Mondong subsequently revised\n\nhis position and claimed that due to a miscalculation, he had actually made full payment of the\n\nUS$530,000 and that he had in fact overpaid Yuninshing a nett amount of IR 1,673,950,000 (in his 3rdaffidavit affirmed on 29 December 2000, at para 33 ). He later revised this figure to IR\n\n1,810,450,000 (in his 4thaffidavit affirmed on 12 February 2001 para 33). Finally, he\n\nadjusted the figure once more to IR 1,250,450,000 (in his 5thaffidavit, affirmed on 22\n\nMarch 2001 at para 77), which was the amount eventually claimed against Yuninshing in the Surabaya\n\nproceedings. In fact the IR figures which appeared in Mondongs 3rdand 4thaffidavits are incorrect as they are in millions instead of billions.13. It was clear from Mondongs affidavits that the crux of the dispute did not\n\nlie with the remittances he received from Yuninshing in Jakarta. The contested issue is whether he\n\nhad satisfied his contractual obligation to remit US dollars back to Yuninshing in Singapore. I also\n\nnote that Mondong did no great favour to his credibility by repeatedly miscalculating the quantum of\n\nwhat was merely six (6) months worth of transactions, which were all in large lump sum amounts.14. The third issue of note is the fact that Mondong has substantial assets\n\nwithin jurisdiction against which a judgment can be enforced. To this end, Yuninshing had obtained a\n\nMareva injunction from the High Court on 2 April 2001 preventing Mondong from dissipating his\n\nindividual and matrimonial assets in Singapore up to the value of US$600,000, in particular:(a) A residential property (held on joint tenancy with his wife Baliati) at No.\n\n  5 Tanjong Rhu Road, #02-02 Waterside Condominium, Singapore 436002;(b) A commercial warehouse at 3, Upper Aljunied Link, #01-04, Blk B, Joo Seng\n\n  Warehouse, Singapore 367902; and(c) Majority shares in Dutair Singapore, held by Mondong and his wife Baliati,\n\n  with an authorised capital of S$150,000 and a paid-up capital of S$100,003.",
        "The law": "15. The principles governing a stay on the ground offorum non conveniensare\n\nwell established; thelocus classicusof this area of law isSpiliada Maritime Corporation\n\nv Cansulex Ltd[1987] AC 460. For ease of reference I lay out the key passage in this case by\n\nLord Goff of Chieveley (at p 476):(a) The basic principle is that a stay will only be granted on the ground offorum\n\n  non convenienswhere the court is satisfied that there is some other available forum, having\n\n  competent jurisdiction, which is the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, i.e. in which\n\n  the case may be tried more suitably for the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice.(b) As Lord Kinnears formulation of the principle indicates, in general the\n\n  burden of proof rests on the defendant to persuade the court to exercise its discretion to grant a\n\n  stay  Furthermore, if the court is satisfied that there is another available forum which is\n\n  prima facie the appropriate forum for the trial of the action, the burden will then shift to the\n\n  plaintiff to show that there are special circumstances by reason of which justice requires that\n\n  the trial should nevertheless take place in this country.\"16.The Spiliadahas been affirmed and applied locally by our Court of\n\nAppeal inBrinkerhoff Maritime Drilling Corp & Anor v PT Airfast Services Indonesia &\n\nAnor[1992] 2 SLR 776,Eng Liat Kiang v Eng Bak Hern[1995] 3 SLR 97,Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v Bhavani Stores Pte Ltd[1998] 1 SLR 253, and most recently inPT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu\n\nEnterprises (Holdings) Limited[2001] 2 SLR 49.17. InPT Hutan, Chao Hick Tin JA commented that whether the process\n\ncontemplated by Lord Goff inThe Spiliadawas a two-stage process or a one-stage process,\n\ntelescoping two into one, did not really matter, for, as he explained (at p 55):\"The ultimate question remains the same: Where should the case be suitably\n\n  tried having regard to the interest of the parties and the ends of justice.\"18. I respectfully agreed and applied theSpiliadatest as follows: Had\n\nthe defendant satisfied this court that the Indonesian court, having competent jurisdiction, was the\n\nappropriate forum for trial of the action, having regard to the interests of all the parties and the\n\nends of justice? If so, had the plaintiff shown that there were any special circumstances why the\n\ntrial should nevertheless have taken place before this jurisdiction?",
        "The appropriate forum": "(i) The Residence of the Parties19. Both parties are Indonesian citizens, and Yuninshing herself resides in\n\nSurabaya.20. It was unclear where Mondong habitually resides. He purported to reside at\n\nGreenville Block Q, No. 5, Jakarta, Indonesia, and admitted that he was under police investigations\n\nfor deception and fraud, which arose when Yuninshing and other parties lodged complaints against\n\nhim. As a result, the Indonesian police had issued a Police Order dated 28 June 2000 requiring him\n\nto report on Mondays and Thursdays to the Directorate of General Offences, Indonesian Police\n\nIntelligence. However, he had stopped reporting to the Directorate since 11 September 2000 on the\n\ngrounds that he was ill and receiving treatment at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, Singapore.\n\nConsequently, the Indonesian police had placed him on the wanted list.21. Mondong however maintained that he still resided in Indonesia but had gone\n\ninto hiding as \"unwanted elements\" might resort to \"strong arm tactics\"\n\nif he turned up at the police station. He further alleged that Yuninshing and her mother wielded\n\nsubstantial influence in Indonesia and might use force against him to resolve the dispute. To\n\nsupport this claim, he referred to a letter purportedly written by Yuninshing informing him that\n\n\"if the matter could not be settled immediately, Mama would pay somebody (known to Mamas\n\nBoss) to solve this matter, definitely they would use a force.\" (sic)22. Conversely, Yuninshing alleged that Mondong frequently visited Singapore and\n\nhad strong family ties here. She alleged that his wife, Baliati, resided here, his three children\n\nwere educated here, and that they lived at the Waterside condominium he owns.23. Having considered the evidence, I found that Mondongs account did severe\n\ndisservice to his appeal. If he truly lived in fear in Indonesia from both legitimate as well as\n\nillegitimate scrutiny, it seems, quite contrarily, that it would have been to his personal advantage\n\nto have the matter heard in Singapore. Ironically, it should have been Yuninshing who would express\n\npreference for litigation in Indonesia. Whatever the truth may be as to Mondongs habitual\n\nresidency, it is clear to me that as a fugitive in Indonesia, he would be ill-disposed to enter an\n\nappearance in any court of law within that jurisdiction. Conversely, insofar as he has both\n\nresidential and commercial interests in Singapore, as well as freedom of movement within this\n\njurisdiction, the issue of residency seems to me to weigh more heavily in favour of this forum.",
        "(ii) Witnesses and documentary evidence": "24. The crux of the dispute lay in Mondongs alleged failure to perform his\n\ncontractual obligation in Singapore. I would reiterate that the methods of contractual performance\n\nby Mondong included:(a) Cash payments of US dollars to Mr Ko Ahok in Jakarta; and(b) Telegraphic transfers from Thomas Cook, HBZ, Christiana Bank and Dutair\n\n  Singapore, to Yuninshings accounts with Republic Central Bank and N M Rothschild & Sons in\n\n  Singapore.25. With regard to the cash payments, Yuninshing had represented that Mr Ko Ahok\n\nis an old family friend and would be willing and able to travel to Singapore to attend as a witness.26. In respect of the telegraphic transfers, I likewise found that as contractual\n\nperformance was to take place in Singapore, documentary proof would be easily attainable within this\n\njurisdiction. The relevant institutions such as Thomas Cook, Rothschild's, as well as Dutair\n\nSingapore are located in Singapore. It is unnecessary, as Mondong submits, to procure Indonesian\n\nwitnesses who handled the transactions on the Jakarta end to prove the remittance. Further, the\n\ndocuments from the above-mentioned financial institutions in Singapore as well as from Christiana\n\nBank and HBZ, would likely be in English and in any case, I could not see that translation of bank\n\nstatements from Bahasa Indonesia would prove of much difficulty to this court. Accordingly, I found\n\nthat with regard to the witnesses and documentary evidence necessary for the main trial, the balance\n\nof convenience clearly lay with a trial within this jurisdiction.",
        "(iii) Illegality": "27. Mondong had submitted at various stages of the proceeding that the oral\n\nagreement was illegal under the laws of Indonesia for several reasons, and as such best dealt with\n\nin an Indonesian court. Firstly, he claimed the agreement was in reality designed to flout currency\n\ncontrols in Indonesia, in that Mondong was effectively smuggling Yuninshings rupiahs out of\n\nIndonesia by courier to convert into US dollars in Singapore. In support of this contention Mondong\n\nclaimed that on one occasion his courier was caught and heavily fined. Secondly, he alleged that\n\nYuninshing had also entered into the agreement for the purpose of tax evasion and money laundering.28. With regard to currency controls, the law in Indonesia has been helpfully set\n\nout by Minang Warman Sofyan & Associates Law Offices, in a letter addressed to Yuninshings\n\nsolicitors dated 23 October 2000 (see exhibit Y8 in Yuninshings 3rdaffidavit filed on\n\n12 March 2001 at p 55). At the material time, the applicable provisions were Indonesian Government\n\nRegulation No. 18 of 1998 dated 17 January 1998, the Decision of the Board of Executive Directors of\n\nBank Indonesia No. 30/181A/KEP/DIR dated 17 January 1998 and No. 30/217A/KEP/DIR dated 6 March 1998.\n\nThe combined effect of these provisions was that the transportation of a sum of between five million\n\nto ten million IRs into or out of Indonesia required the making of a declaration, and the\n\ntransportation of a sum in excess of ten million IRs required a permit from Bank Indonesia.29. The present transaction would clearly have been an illegal one if it had\n\nspecifically provided for the transporting of rupiahs into or out of Indonesia without a permit,\n\ngiven the quantum of the sums involved. However, I did not find that the contract contemplated such\n\na transaction. It is within ordinary commercial practice to effect a standing foreign exchange\n\narrangementinter partesin order to save on losses resulting from open market trading.\n\nFurthermore, there is evidence that Yuninshing had performed such transactions legally via\n\ntelegraphic transfer when Mondong had no US dollars to exchange with her. In such circumstances, she\n\nhad purchased US dollars from Rothschild's and remitted IRs into the ABN-AMRO Bank in Jakarta. It is\n\nhighly unlikely that she would have done so if she had an arrangement with Mondong to illegally\n\nsmuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Moreover, had Yuninshing been privy to an illegal contract, it is\n\ndoubtful that she would have reported Mondong to the Indonesian authorities for fraud in the first\n\nplace.30. It seemed far more likely to me that Mondong had simply acted on his own\n\ninitiative to illegally smuggle rupiahs out of Indonesia. Such action does not, without more, taint\n\nthe contract with illegality. A contract capable of legal fulfilment is not rendered illegal simply\n\nbecause of the nefarious means by which the promisor chooses to fulfil it.31. As for money laundering and tax evasion, I found that the claims made by\n\nMondong were bare assertions and completely unsupported by evidence. Accordingly, I found that the\n\nissue of illegality was quite simply a red herring.",
        "Special circumstances justifying refusal of stay": "32. Had Mondong been able to convince me that, prima facie, Indonesia was the\n\nmore appropriate forum for the hearing of this dispute, there would nevertheless have existed\n\nspecial circumstances in favour of refusing a stay of proceedings. The matter had already proceeded\n\nto an advanced stage within this jurisdiction. As of the hearing date, the parties had filed several\n\naffidavits (Yuninshing had filed five and Mondong six). Both parties had also adduced substantial\n\ndocumentary evidence within their affidavits. The Statement of Claim and the Defence for the main\n\naction had likewise been filed. In addition, Yuninshing had obtained interim relief in the form of a\n\nMareva injunction to secure her chances of satisfaction upon judgment.33. In contrast, the Surabaya claim had quite inexplicably been retracted by\n\nMondong on 12 April 2001. Further, in view of Mondongs fugitive status, there was no indication\n\nthat there would remain any worthwhile assets in Indonesia against which a potential judgment could\n\nbe enforced. Thus, even if Yuninshing succeeded in a fresh action in Indonesia, she would in all\n\nlikelihood still have to apply to our courts to enforce the ruling as a judgment debt, if indeed by\n\nsuch time there were still assets remaining within this jurisdiction.",
        "Conclusion": "34. The burden was upon the defendant to persuade this court to exercise its\n\ndiscretion to grant a stay on the grounds offorum non conveniens. As emphasized by Lord Goff\n\ninThe Spiliadaand our Court of Appeal inPT Hutan, this is not simply a question of\n\npractical convenience, but of whether the forum is the most appropriate one in the interests of all\n\nparties and the ends of justice. Although the oral agreement was concluded in Surabaya and\n\nremittances by Yuninshing took place in Jakarta, the central issue in dispute was contractual\n\nperformance by Mondong in Singapore, that is, the remittance of US dollars into Yuninshings bank\n\naccounts in Singapore. Proof of this issue would largely be found within this jurisdiction. Further,\n\nMondongs fugitive status in Indonesia suggested that he was unlikely to enter an appearance\n\nbefore or place his assets at the disposal of, the Indonesian courts. Conversely, there was every\n\nindication that he had a residential presence in Singapore and, by his own account, it seemed to be\n\nto his personal advantage to attend court within this jurisdiction. Finally, proceedings in\n\nSingapore were at a very advanced stage, with numerous affidavits filed by both parties and a Mareva\n\ninjunction obtained to secure enforcement of a prospective judgment. It was clear that the interests\n\nof the parties and the ends of justice pointed towards Singapore as the place of adjudication of\n\nthis claim.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
