        "Background1.        The Plaintiff is one\n\nRanjeet Kaur. Ms Kaur was the owner and driver of a vehicle and met with an accident which\n\nshe said was caused by the First and 2ndDefendants, Chiang Sung Chek and\n\nBasaruddin Bin Jumahat, who were each driving another vehicle.": "2.        Ms Kaur commenced an action\n\nin the Magistrate’s Court on 29 February 2000 against each of the two Defendants\n\nclaiming damages for personal injury and loss.3.        Subsequently, interlocutory\n\njudgment was obtained by Ms Kaur on 17 September 2001 on the basis that liability was\n\napportioned as between her and each of the two Defendants. The actual apportionment was\n\nnot material to the appeal before me.4.        On 15 February 2002, Ms\n\nKaur applied in the Magistrate’s Court for her action to be transferred to the\n\nDistrict Court on the same basis as that of the plaintiff in MC Suit No 12116 of 2000/N\n\n(‘No 12116’). This application was dismissed. She then appealed to a District\n\nJudge. Before this appeal was heard by District Judge Ng Peng Hong, he had ruled against\n\nthe transfer in respect of a similar appeal in No 12116. Accordingly, his ruling also\n\napplied to Ms Kaur’s appeal.5.        Ms Kaur then appealed to\n\nthe High Court and that appeal was heard by me on the same day as the appeal by the\n\nplaintiff in No 12116. Counsel for the parties in the present suit, i.e MC Suit No 605828\n\nof 2000, agreed that the arguments were the same as in No 12116 but with an additional\n\nargument which I will deal with below. In so far as the arguments were the same, the\n\nparties greed to be bound by my decision in No 12116.6.        I dismissed the appeal in\n\nNo 12116 and I have since given by Grounds of Decision. Those Grounds will naturally apply\n\nas well to the appeal by Ms Kaur.7.        However, there was an\n\nadditional argument by the Defendants in Ms Kaur’s action i.e that because she had\n\nalready obtained interlocutory judgment from the Magistrate’s Court, she should not\n\nbe allowed to transfer her action to the District Court.8.        I have recently ruled on\n\nthis point in Originating Summons No 46 of 2002/WRicky Charles s/o Gabriel Thanabalan\n\nv Chua Boon Yeow. Although that case involved s 38 of the Subordinate Courts Act (Cap\n\n321) and involved the question of a transfer from the District Court to the High Court,\n\nunlike the present case which involved s 53 and a transfer from the Magistrate’s\n\nCourt to the District Court, I was of the view that the Magistrate’s Court also has\n\nno power under s 53 to transfer Ms Kaur’s action from the Magistrate’s Court to\n\nthe District Court once interlocutory judgment had been entered in favour of Ms Kaur by\n\nthe Magistrate’s Court.9.        There was also no question\n\nof the Magistrate’s Court exercising its discretionary power because none of the\n\nrequirements in s 53 were met. Section 53 does not have the words ‘or for any other\n\nsufficient reason’ whereas s 38 does.10.        I should mention that my\n\ndecision in theRicky Charlescase is the subject of an appeal to the Court of\n\nAppeal."
