(b)    Second Charge That you, John Tay Choon Leng, an Advocate and\n                            Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, on or\n                            about 28 February 2009 and whilst practicing\n                            with the Firm of M/s John Tay & Co located at\n                            171 Chin Swee Road, #08-09 San Centre, Singapore\n                            169877, did pay the sum of $2,000.00 received by you\n                            from your client Teo Yeow Hock as a deposit to\n                            account of fees for you to act in D4476/2008/S\n                            and/or MSS941/2009 into the Office Account of the\n                            Firm instead of the Client Account and are thereby\n                            guilty of a breach of Rule 3(1) of the Legal\n                            Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts) Rules, such\n                            breach amounting to improper conduct or practice as\n                            an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of\n                            Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act\n                            (Chapter 161). (c)    Third Charge That you, John Tay Choon Leng, an Advocate and\n                            Solicitor of the Supreme Court of Singapore, from on\n                            or about 28 February 2009 and whilst practicing\n                            with the Firm of M/s John Tay & Co located at\n                            171 Chin Swee Road, #08-09 San Centre, Singapore\n                            169877, did fail to properly and/or adequately\n                            inform your client Teo Yeow Hock of the basis on\n                            which fees for professional services for acting for\n                            him in D4476/2008/S and MSS941/2009 would be charged\n                            and the manner in which it was expected that those\n                            fees and disbursements should be paid and are\n                            thereby guilty of a breach of Rule 35(a) of the\n                            Legal Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules, such\n                            breach amounting to improper conduct or practice as\n                            an advocate and solicitor within the meaning of\n                            Section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act\n                            (Chapter 161). 3       In short, the first two\n                    charges relate to the Respondent depositing the two sums\n                    received from one Mr Teo Yeow Hock (“the\n                    Complainant”) into his office account in breach of\n                    Rule 3(1) of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’\n                    Accounts) Rules (Cap 161, R 8, 1999 Rev Ed)\n                    (“the SA Rules”). The third charge is for\n                    failing to adequately inform the Complainant of the basis on\n                    which his professional fees would be charged, in breach of\n                    Rule 35(a) of the Legal\n                    Profession (Professional Conduct) Rules (Cap 161,\n                    R 1, 1990 Rev Ed) (“the PC\n                        Rules”).[note: 1]",
        "Background facts": "4       At all material times, the\n                    Respondent was the sole proprietor of the law firm of Messrs\n                    John Tay & Co. He was called to the Singapore Bar on\n                    12 May 1982, an Advocate and Solicitor of 26\n                    years’ standing at the time of the alleged\n                    misconduct. 5       At around the end of\n                    February 2009, the Complainant engaged the Respondent to act\n                    for him in respect of ancillary matters in D4476/2008/S (a\n                    divorce proceedings between the Complainant and his wife)\n                    (“the Divorce Ancillaries”) and MSS 941/2009\n                    (an application by the Complainant’s wife for\n                    maintenance) (“the Maintenance\n                    Summons”). 6       It is not disputed that the\n                    complainant was a client of another advocate and solicitor,\n                    Mr Tan Ee Bin (“Mr Tan”), who handled the\n                    Complainant’s divorce proceedings. However, as Mr Tan\n                    did not normally handle contentious divorce ancillaries\n                    matters, Mr Tan recommended the Respondent to the\n                    Complainant and they met at Mr Tan’s office on\n                    27 February 2009. The Respondent said that at that\n                    meeting he had informed the Complainant that his fees would\n                    be as follows: (a)     Upfront initial\n                        fee or advanced payment of $3,000 for handling the\n                        Divorce Ancillaries (“the Divorce Ancillaries\n                        Initial Upfront Fee”); (b)     Additional fees\n                        would be payable and such fees would be discussed if the\n                        matter went for trial;[note: 2]and (c)     There would be a contingency fee of $3,000 in the\n                        event that the ancillary matters were transferred to the\n                        High Court (“the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency\n                        Fee”) if the estimated matrimonial assets\n                        exceeded $1.5 million. 7       The following day, on\n                    28 February 2009, the Complainant came to the\n                    Respondent’s office in the morning when the latter was\n                    about to leave for a court hearing. The Complainant informed\n                    the Respondent that he had been served with the Maintenance\n                    Summons, and that he would also like the Respondent to\n                    handle that matter. The Complainant had brought with him\n                    $2,000 in cash and a POSB cheque for $3,000, both of which\n                    he handed to the Respondent. The Respondent said that he\n                    told the Complainant that the $2,000 cash would be treated\n                    as part payment towards the Divorce Ancillaries Initial\n                    Upfront Fee and the cheque for $3,000 as the upfront fee for\n                    handling the Maintenance Summons. Their conversation lasted\n                    for only five minutes as the Respondent was in a hurry to\n                    attend court on another client’s matter. A receipt was\n                    issued by the Respondent’s firm in respect of the\n                    $2,000 cash payment. We would note that the receipt stated\n                    that the $2,000 cash payment was “initial payment for\n                    MSS941/2009”, the Maintenance Summons. 8       Subsequently, the\n                    Complainant decided to appoint another set of solicitors to\n                    take over the conduct of both the Divorce Ancillaries and\n                    the Maintenance Summons. On 3 September 2009, the\n                    Complainant wrote to the Respondent asking for a refund of\n                    the $3,000 paid as the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency Fee.\n                    Initially, the Respondent did not agree to make any refund\n                    as he had done work for both the Divorce Ancillaries and the\n                    Maintenance Summons. Eventually, the Respondent agreed to\n                    refund $1,500, although this refund of $1,500 was never\n                    effected. 9       On 1 February 2010, the\n                    Complainant filed a complaint with the Law Society. After\n                    investigation, the Law Society preferred the three charges\n                    against the Respondent (see[2]above). 10     At the hearing before the\n                    DT, as against the first two charges, the Respondent raised\n                    the defence that the Complainant and Respondent had agreed\n                    that the $2,000 cash and the cheque for $3,000 were the\n                    Respondent’s fees and therefore did not constitute\n                    “client’s money” under\n                        r 2(b) of the SA\n                        Rules.[note: 3]The Respondent argued\n                    therefore that he was not obliged to deposit them into a\n                    client account (as set out and further discussed in[14]to[34]below).",
        "Decision Below": "11     The DT, after due hearing,\n                    found pursuant to s 93(1)(c)\n                    of the LPA that cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary\n                    action existed under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA and ordered the Respondent to pay\n                    costs. In reaching this decision, the DT made the following\n                    findings of fact: (a)     The $3,000 by\n                        way of a POSB cheque (“the $3,000”) and\n                        $2,000 cash were paid into the Respondent’s office\n                            account;[note: 4] (b)     There was no\n                        agreement on account of an agreed fee between the\n                        Respondent and the Complainant because,inter alia:[note: 5] (i)       The\n                            Respondent’s evidence given under\n                            cross-examination corroborated the\n                            Complainant’s evidence that the payments made\n                            were only part of the Respondent’s\n                            professional fees; (ii)       The\n                            Respondent’s receipt for the $2,000 did not\n                            state that it was an agreed fee. It stated that it\n                            was “initial payment for\n                                MSS941/2009”;[note: 6] (iii)       The\n                            $3,000 was meant to be a deposit in the event that\n                            D4476/2008/S was transferred to the High Court, and\n                            no agreement was made to convert the $3,000 to\n                            agreed fees for MSS941/2009.[note: 7] (a)     In any case, the\n                        alleged fees agreement were not reduced into writing and\n                        signed by the complainant. (c)     The Respondent did not\n                        explain the basis and manner of his fees, and this was\n                        conceded during cross-examination;[note: 8]and (d)     The Respondent did not explain his charges to the\n                        Complainant even after the Complainant repeatedly asked\n                        for a refund of $3,000. Instead, the Respondent: (i)       Issued\n                            a bill on or about 3 September 2009 after the\n                            Complainant’s first letter was\n                        faxed; (ii)       Did not explain the basis\n                            of his fees or when or how his fees or expenses\n                            would be incurred or should be\n                        paid; (iii)       Did not reply to any of\n                            the Complainant’s letters;\n                        and (iv)       Agreed to a refund of\n                                $1,500.[note: 9] 12     The DT also found as a\n                    matter of law that an “agreed fee” was not\n                    valid unless it was evidenced in writing.",
        "Issues before this Court": "13     As seen from the above,\n                    the critical question in relation to the first and second\n                    charges is whether there was an agreement on fees between\n                    the Complaint and the Respondent. The DT found that there\n                    was in fact no such agreement. The DT also decided that in\n                    law, there could not, in any event, have been an\n                    “agreed fee” because the alleged agreements\n                    were not evidenced in writing signed by the client. Thus, on\n                    this matter there are really five issues which this court\n                    must address and we will deal with them in the following\n                    order: (a)     Whether or not\n                        an “agreed fee” under r 9(2)(c)(ii) of the SA Rules must be\n                        in writing; (b)     Whether or not an “agreed\n                        fee” must be for the entire\n                    transaction; (c)     Whether or not the totality of the\n                        evidence demands that this Court should overturn the\n                        DT’s findings of fact,ie, that there was no agreed fee, in\n                        relation to the first two charges; (d)     Whether there is\n                        sufficient basis for the DT to find the Respondent\n                        guilty of the third charge; and (e)     The appropriate\n                        sanction in the event this court should find the\n                        Respondent guilty of any of the three\n                    charges.",

        "Issue 1: Whether or not an “agreed\n                fee” must be in writing": "14     This is a threshold issue.\n                    If this Court is to find that an “agreed fee”\n                    must be in writing to come into being, then as the alleged\n                    agreements here were not reduced to writing, the Respondent\n                    automatically fails to make out the defence of an\n                    “agreed fee” under r 9(2)(c)(ii) of the SA Rules. This answer will\n                    effectively resolve all the other issues relating to the\n                    three charges and what remains for this Court would be to\n                    determine the appropriate sanction which ought to be imposed\n                    on the Respondent. 15     As a general proposition,\n                    the formation and validity of an agreement on professional\n                    fees between a solicitor and his or her client (“fee\n                    agreement”) is, like any other contract, governed by\n                    the common law. Such an agreement could be oral or in\n                    writing. This is, of course, subject to any relevant\n                    contrary provisions set out in the LPA and/or its attendant\n                    subsidiary legislation. 16     The DT seemed to think\n                    that for a valid “fee agreement” to exist, the\n                    agreement must be in writing. The DT stated (at [20] of its\n                    Report): Rule 9(2)(c)(ii) of the SA Rules is to be read with or\n                        subject to section 111 of the [Legal Profession] Act\n                        which requires any agreement between a solicitor and his\n                        client concerning his fee for contentious business to be\n                        “in writing” and “signed by the\n                        client”. Internal Architecture of Rule 9(2),\n                Solicitors’ Accounts Rules 17     We will begin our\n                    consideration of this question by first referring to the SA\n                    Rules which prescribe how a solicitor should handle\n                    client’s money. Rule 2(1) defines\n                    “client’s money” as: money held or received by a solicitor on account\n                        of a person for whom he is acting (in relation to\n                        the holding or receipt of such money) either as a\n                        solicitor, or in connection with his practice as a\n                        solicitor, an agent, a bailee or a stakeholder or\n                        in any other capacity, other than — ... (b)    money to which the only person\n                            entitled is the solicitor himself or, in the\n                            case of a firm of solicitors, one or more of\n                            the partners in the firm... 18     Rule 3(1) lays down a\n                    mandatory requirement that every solicitor who holds or\n                    receives client’s money “shall without delay\n                    pay such money into a client account”. 19     Rule 9(2), however,\n                    provides a list of circumstances where a solicitor is not\n                    required to pay money held or received by him into a client\n                    account: 9(2)  Notwithstanding the\n                            provisions of these Rules, a solicitor shall\n                            not pay into a client account, money held or\n                            received by him — (a)    which the client for his own\n                            convenience requests the solicitor in writing\n                            to withhold from such account; (b)    for or towards payment of a\n                            debt due to the solicitor from the client or in\n                            reimbursement of money expended by the\n                            solicitor on behalf of the client; or (c)which is expressly paid to\n                                him — (i)    on account of costs incurred,\n                            in respect of which a bill of costs or other\n                            written intimation of the amount of the costs\n                            has been delivered for payment; or (ii)as an agreed fee (or on\n                                account of an agreed fee) for business\n                                undertaken or to be\n                            undertaken. [emphasis added] 20     The Respondent relies on\n                        r 9(2)(c)(ii) to\n                    contend that in respect of the two sums he received from the\n                    client on 28 February 2009 he was not required to\n                    deposit them into a client account because those two\n                    payments were agreed fees due to him for taking up the two\n                    briefs of the complainant. He is saying that these payments\n                    were really, in accordance with r 2(1), “money\n                    to which the only person entitled is the solicitor\n                    himself” and were thus not client’s\n                    money. 21     It would be seen from r\n                    9(2) quoted above (at[19]) that where writing is required, the\n                    Rules would expressly provide for such a requirement. We see\n                    two instances of this in r 9(2). First, r 9(2)(a) provides that where a client for\n                    his own convenience “requests the solicitorin writing” to withhold\n                    paying the money into a client’s account then the\n                    solicitor would not infringe the rule if he complies with\n                    the request. Second, r 9(2)(c)(i) provides that where money is expressly\n                    paid to the solicitor on account of costs incurred, in\n                    respect of which “a bill of costsor other written\n                        intimation” has been delivered for\n                    payment, the solicitor will not be required to pay the sum\n                    into a client account. On the other hand, r 9(2)(c)(ii), which we are here concerned\n                    with, merely provides for “an agreed fee”\n                    without imposing any formal requirement as to writing. In\n                    this regard, it may be useful to note that, unlike r\n                        9(2)(c)(ii), the\n                    equivalent English rule, r 19(5) of the English\n                    Solicitors’ Accounts Rules 1998, expressly provides\n                    that “[a]n agreed fee must be evidenced in\n                    writing”. In the absence of such express stipulation\n                    in r 9(2), the Respondent argued that the court should be\n                    slow to imply such a requirement. Symbiosis between Rule 9(2)(c)(ii) and Section\n                111, Legal Profession Act 22     We now turn to consider s\n                    111 of the LPA upon which the DT had placed much reliance to\n                    hold that for there to be a valid “fee\n                    agreement” the agreement must be evidenced in writing\n                    (see[16]above).For ease of\n                    reference, s 111 is quoted hereunder: (1)    Subject to the provisions\n                            of any other written law, a solicitor or a law\n                            corporation or a limited liability law\n                            partnershipmay make an agreement\n                                in writingwith any client\n                            respecting the amount and manner of payment for\n                            the whole or any part of its costs in respectof\n                            contentious business done or to be done by the\n                            solicitor or the law corporation or the limited\n                            liability law partnership, either by a gross sum\n                            or otherwise, and at either the same rate as or\n                            a greater or a lesser rate than that at which\n                            he or the law corporation or the\n                            limited liability law partnership would\n                            otherwise be entitled to be\n                        remunerated. (2)    Every such agreement shall be\n                            signed by the client and shall be subject to\n                            the provisions and conditions contained in this\n                            Part. [emphasis added] 23     The first point we would\n                    highlight is that s 111(1) provides that a solicitor\n                        “may make an agreement in\n                        writing” with a client for his fees in\n                    contentious business. It would be noted that the provision\n                    is couched inpermissive,\n                    rather thanmandatory, terms.\n                    It does not say that there could not be an oral fee\n                    agreement or that such an oral agreement would be invalid.\n                    In the absence of such an express stipulation, we see no\n                    reason why it should be so construed. InWee Soon Kim Anthony v Chor Pee &\n                        Partners[2006] 1 SLR(R) 518 (“theChor Peecase”),\n                    the Court of Appeal held at [26] that s 111(1) is “an enabling\n                    provision and is not intended to replace the common\n                    law”. Similarly, Professor Tan Yock Lin, inThe Law of Advocates and Solicitors in\n                        Singapore and West Malaysia(Butterworths\n                    Asia, 2ndEd, 1998)\n                        (“Tan Yock\n                    Lin”) at p 685 has opined that s 111 is\n                    “an empowering section”. 24     What, then, are the\n                    effects and consequences of s 111? First, we note that by\n                    virtue of s 111(2), any fee agreement to be enforceable\n                    against the client must be signed by the client. This is\n                    obviously for the protection of the client. In theChor Peecase, the Court of Appeal\n                    stated at [26]: Indeed, s 111(1) essentially reflects much of the\n                        common law position. In a sense, it can be said that the\n                        provision is for the benefit of the solicitor as it\n                        means that upon the solicitor ensuring that the written\n                        agreement has the signature of the client, and in the\n                        absence of there being any vitiating factors, the\n                        solicitor will be able to enforce the agreement against\n                        the client. In another sense, one can also say that s\n                        111 was enacted to protect the client, so that no\n                        agreement, not even a written agreement, would bind the\n                        client unless the client signified his consent thereto\n                        by his signature. However, the absence of the\n                        solicitor's signature would not preclude the client from\n                        enforcing it against the solicitor. Section 111(2)\n                        enshrines that position... In other words, a client can enforce an oral agreement\n                        against a solicitor but not the other way around. 25     The statutory consequences\n                    of a fee agreement made in writing in accordance with s 111\n                    are found in ss 112(3) and 112(4): (3)    Such an agreement shall be\n                            deemed to exclude any further claim of the\n                            solicitor or law corporation or limited\n                            liability law partnership beyond the terms of\n                            agreement in respect of any services, fees,\n                            charges or disbursements in relation to the\n                            conduct and completion of the business in reference\n                            to which the agreement is made, except such\n                            services, fees, charges or disbursements (if\n                            any) as are expressly excepted by the agreement. (4)    Subject to the provisions of\n                            this Part, the costs of a solicitor or law\n                            corporation or limited liability law\n                            partnership, in any case where there is such an\n                            agreement as is referred to in section 111,\n                            shall not be subject to taxation nor to the\n                            provisions of section 118. 26     It would be noted that the\n                    provisions of s 112(4) are expressly stated to be subject to\n                    “the provisions of this Part” and the\n                    following subsections of s 113 are germane and they show\n                    that even written fee agreements, enforceable against the\n                    client, are far from sacrosanct and could be reviewed and\n                    set aside. (2)    Every question respecting the\n                            validity or effect of the agreement may be\n                            examined and determined, and the agreement may\n                            be enforced or set aside without suit or action\n                            on the application by originating summons of\n                            any person or the representatives of any\n                            person, party to the agreement, or being or alleged\n                            to be liable to pay, or being or claiming to be\n                            entitled to be paid the costs, fees, charges or\n                            disbursements in respect of which the\n                            agreement is made, by the court in which the\n                            business or any part thereof was done or a\n                            Judge thereof, or, if the business was not done in\n                            any court, then by the High Court or a Judge\n                            thereof. (3)    Upon any such application, if\n                            it appears to the court or Judge that the\n                            agreement is in all respects fair and\n                            reasonable between the parties, it may be enforced\n                            by the court or Judge by rule or order, in such\n                            manner and subject to such conditions (if any)\n                            as to the costs of the application as the court or\n                            Judge thinks fit. (4)    If the terms of the agreement\n                            are deemed by the court or Judge to be unfair\n                            or unreasonable, the agreement may be declared\n                            void. 27     Finally, s 118, referred\n                    to in s 112(4), provides that: [N]o solicitor shall, except by leave of the\n                        court, commence or maintain any action for the recovery\n                        of any costs due for any business done by him until\n                        the expiration of one month after he has delivered\n                        to the party to be charged therewith, or sent by\n                        post to, or left with him at his office or place of\n                        business, dwelling-house or last known place of\n                        residence, a bill of those costs. 28     Therefore, in the light of\n                    all the provisions mentioned above, a fee agreement in\n                    writing made in accordance with s 111 could give rise\n                    to,inter alia, the following\n                    effects, depending on the nature of the complaint and/or on\n                    whose initiative the issue is being brought before the\n                    court: (a)     the solicitor\n                        would be precluded from making any further claims for\n                        costs beyond the terms of the agreement and the agreed\n                        fees need not be taxed, (b)     the agreement could be\n                        declared to be unreasonable and void by the court,\n                        and/or (c)     the solicitor is not obliged to wait\n                        one month after sending a bill of costs to the client\n                        before commencing an action to enforce the fee\n                        agreement. 29     There is nothing in those\n                    provisions which could be read to suggest that an oral fee\n                    agreement is invalid. From s 111(2) it is clear that\n                    Parliament intended to draw a distinction between validity\n                    and enforceability and sought to accord greater protection\n                    to the client. This explains why, following from\n                    s 111(2), a client could enforce an agreement not\n                    signed by the solicitor (and this would include an oral\n                    agreement). This view was taken by the High Court, and we\n                    say rightly so, inRe NirumalamKanapathiPillai[1999]\n                    3 SLR(R) 1037, a case relied on by the Respondent,\n                    where Judith Prakash J reviewed an assistant\n                    registrar’s taxation of a solicitor-client bill of\n                    costs tendered by the solicitor’s firm. The taxing\n                    registrar did not take into account an express agreement\n                    between the solicitor’s firm and the petitioner, one\n                    of 30 insurance companies, who had instructed the respondent\n                    on an express oral agreement that the respondent’s\n                    costs would be shared according to their respective shares\n                    in the reinsurance risk. 30     The fee agreement, not\n                    having been expressed in writing, clearly fell outside the\n                    remit of s 111 and the other related provisions of\n                    ss 112, 113 and 118. Nevertheless, the judge held at\n                        [26] and\n                        [27]\n                    that: 26    I accept that as between\n                            petitioner and the respondent in this case, there\n                            was no agreement which fell within the bounds of s\n                            111 of the [Legal Profession Act]. This means that\n                            the respondent firm was bound to tax its bill once\n                            taxation was asked for and ordered. It does not\n                            mean, however, that it had not agreed on a\n                            particular formula for computing the extent of the\n                            petitioner’s liability for the legal costs\n                            incurred by the firm in acting for the petitioner\n                            and the other reinsurers in relation to the matter.\n                            Neither does it mean that the respondent firm was\n                            not bound by such agreement... 27    I see no reason in principle or\n                            in practice why the taxing Registrar should not have\n                            had regard to this agreement, even though it was not\n                            an agreement falling within s 111 of the [Legal\n                            Profession Act]. 31     At this juncture, we think\n                    it useful to refer to another case where the Disciplinary\n                    Committee (the previous title of the current DT) had the\n                    occasion to address specifically the scope of\n                        r 9(2)(c)(ii) of the\n                    SA Rules:The Law Society of Singapore v\n                        Chua Swee Keng[2008] SGDSC 6\n                        (“Chua Swee\n                    Keng”). There the DC ruled that\n                        r 9(2)(c)(ii) is not\n                    subject to s 111 of the LPA (at [11.5.6]). Following\n                    from the reasons based on a plain reading of\n                        r 9(2)(c)(ii), as\n                    well as the fact that where it was intended that the fee\n                    agreement should be in writing the SA Rules would expressly\n                    say so (rr 9(2)(a) and\n                        9(2)(c)(i)), the DC\n                    elaborated at [11.5.6(b)]: ...the drafting convention adopted in rule 9 is\n                        expressly to require writing when it is needed. This\n                        convention makes the omission of a requirement of\n                        writing in rule 9(2)(c)(ii) of substantive\n                        significance. 32     Equally helpful in\n                    explaining the scope of s 111 are the following passages\n                    fromTan Yock Linat\n                    p 685 where the author succinctly reviewed the previous\n                    position and the current position: Before the English statutory enactment, with which\n                        section 111 [of the LPA] isin parimateria,\n                        was enacted, a solicitor could make an oral agreement\n                        with his client as to remuneration for prosecuting\n                        contentious business. For example, he could orally agree\n                        to charge nothing for the services; but if he made an\n                        oral agreement for more than his proper costs in\n                        prosecuting or defending an action, that agreement could\n                        not be enforced by him. Section 111...was designed to\n                        enable a solicitor to enforce such agreements provided\n                        they are in writing. Section 111 has nothing to do with validity but is\n                        concerned only with enforceability by the solicitor.\n                        Being an empowering section, it does not affect the\n                        position of a client who sets up an agreement as to\n                        costs. Before the enactment of section 111, a client\n                        could enforce an oral agreement as to costs against his\n                        solicitor and that remains true after the enactment.\n                        Thus inClare v Joseph, in\n                        an action brought to recover moneys received by a\n                        solicitor to the use of his client, the English Court of\n                        Appeal held that the client continued to be entitled,\n                        despite the enactment of the English equivalent of\n                        section 111, to set up an oral agreement by the\n                        solicitor to be paid less than usual costs. However,\n                        where a solicitor purports to set up an agreement as to\n                        costs, the agreement must be in writing for it to be\n                        enforceable. 33     We would hasten to\n                    emphasise that the client is not deprived of protection\n                    simply because there is an oral fee agreement. InWong Foong Chai v Lin Kuo Hao[2005]\n                    3 SLR(R) 74, Andrew Phang Boon Leong JC\n                    stated at [31]\n                    that: [N]o agreement for the payment of costs between client\n                        and solicitor is sacrosanct in the sense that it is\n                        conclusive and immune to, as well as impervious from,\n                        any investigation by the court itself. That such\n                        agreements can in fact be – and are –\n                        subject to the court's scrutiny, particularly from the\n                        perspective of reasonableness and fairness, is\n                        established in both local as well as English case\n                        law. Indeed, if the Complainant here were to complain\n                    about the reasonableness of the fees charged by the\n                    Respondent, the latter would, by virtue of s 111(2), be\n                    precluded from relying on the oral fee agreement with the\n                    Complainant to justify the fee charged. 34     We would reiterate that\n                    all seeming difficulties or incongruity would vanish if\n                        r 9(2)(c)(ii) is\n                    viewed not as a provision concerned with the enforceability\n                    of a fee agreement, but only in determining whether there is\n                    an agreement between the solicitor and client which would\n                    permit the solicitor not to have to place money so received\n                    by him from a client into a client account. We find that is\n                    the proper reading of r 9(2)(c)(ii). The question, then, in this case, is\n                    whether or not there were, in fact, the alleged oral\n                    agreements between the Respondent and the Complainant on\n                    fees relating to the two matters which the Complainant had\n                    entrusted the Respondent to handle and which would warrant\n                    the Respondent depositing the two sums he received from the\n                    Complainant into the firm’s account. As this would\n                    amount to the Complainant paying the Respondent in advance\n                    of work being performed, clear proof of the client’s\n                    agreement must be established. In this regard, it is\n                    pertinent to note that when a solicitor has done work for a\n                    client and wishes to pay himself, he has to observe the\n                    following rules: (i)     Where the\n                        payment is to be taken from client’s account\n                        – “money properly required for or towards\n                        payment of the solicitor’s costs where a bill of\n                        costs or other written intimation of the amount of the\n                        costs incurred has been delivered to the client and the\n                        client has been notified that money held for him will be\n                        applied towards or in satisfaction of such costs”\n                        (see r 7(1)(a)(iv) of the SA Rules);\n                    or (ii)     Where the payment is from money held or received\n                        by him – “which is expressly paid to him on\n                        account of costs incurred, in respect of which a bill of\n                        costs or other written intimation of the amount of the\n                        costs has been delivered for payment” (see r\n                        9(2)(c)(i) of the SA Rules).",
        "Issue 2: Whether or not an “agreed\n                fee” must be for the entirety of the\n                transaction": "35     We now move to the second\n                    issue as to whether an agreed fee could be in respect of\n                    part of the work to be undertaken by the solicitor on the\n                    contentious matter entrusted to him or if it must cover the\n                    entire work in relation to the engagement. The DT did not\n                    appear to have considered this issue as it had found that\n                    there was in fact no agreement on fees between the\n                    Complainant and the Respondent because in its view the\n                    $2,000 cash and $3,000 cheque were in fact deposit or\n                    initial payment. We do not see anything in r 9(2)(c)(ii) of the SA Rules which\n                    expressly or implicitly touches, or has a bearing, on this.\n                    However, s 111 of the Act states clearly that “a\n                    solicitor ... may make an agreement in writing with any\n                    client respecting the amount and manner of paymentfor the whole or any part of its\n                        costsin respect of\n                    contentious business”. Thus, as an agreed fee in\n                    writing could be made in respect of the costs of part of the\n                    work to be undertaken by the solicitor, or up to a certain\n                    stage of the proceeding, we cannot see any reason why an\n                    oral agreement could not be similarly made. In this regard,\n                    we would underscore the need to differentiate between\n                    matters of principle and matters of evidence. One should not\n                    confuse the two. It may well be that where an oral agreement\n                    is involved, there could be difficulties in proving what the\n                    parties had exactly agreed on as fees, both in terms of the\n                    amount as well as the scope of work covered by that agreed\n                    fees. But the fact that there could be such evidential\n                    difficulties does not mean that there could not be an oral\n                    fee agreement touching on part of the work to be undertaken\n                    by the solicitor. This may explain why, as a matter of good\n                    practice, it is always desirable to reflect all fee\n                    agreements in writing. 36     Having said that, we would\n                    caution that solicitors have the obligation to make\n                    abundantly clear – both to the client and, if need be,\n                    to the court – which specific part (or up to which\n                    specific stage) of the transaction is covered by the agreed\n                    fees. For the protection of the client, a solicitor cannot\n                    be allowed to vary his agreed fees upwards at his\n                    will.",
        "Issue 3: Whether or not there is any reason to\n                overturn the DT’s findings of fact with respect to the\n                first two charges": "37     We now turn to consider\n                    the issue as to whether the Complainant had agreed with the\n                    Respondent on an agreed fee in respect of each of the two\n                    matters, namely, the Divorce Ancillaries and the Maintenance\n                    Summons. The DT found that there was no agreement between\n                    them on fees. The law is clear that an appellate court\n                    should not seek to overturn a finding of fact which is based\n                    on oral evidence and the veracity or credibility of\n                    witnesses unless the lower tribunal had wrongly appreciated\n                    the facts or the finding is plainly wrong or against the\n                    weight of the evidence (seeTat Seng\n                        Machine Movers Pte Ltd v Orix Singapore Ltd[2009] 4 SLR(R) 1101 at [41] andYeo Chong Lin v Tay Ang Choo Nancy[2011] 2 SLR 1157 at [42]). While we note that the principles\n                    established in these two authorities relate to findings of\n                    the lower courts which are up for consideration by the\n                    appellate court, there is no good reason why the same\n                    principles (of good sense and expedience) should not apply\n                    in the present context. 38     In the present case, the\n                    evidence is predominantly oral, essentially from\n                    cross-examination. There are only a few pieces of objective\n                    documentary evidence (eg, the\n                    receipt issued for the $2000 in cash was dated\n                    28 February 2009) and the findings of the DT could be\n                    said to be based largely on witness credibility. There is,\n                    however, one observation of the DT which gives us cause for\n                    some concern and which we think warrants this court to\n                    review the evidence and the findings of the\n                DT. 39     At [19] of its Report, the DT\n                    stated that the alleged agreement on fee “was not\n                    pleaded in the Defence and was also not referred to in the\n                    Respondent’s Opening Statement”. This comment\n                    showed that the DT thought that the defence of an agreed fee\n                    was an afterthought raised at the last minute at the DT\n                    hearing. With respect, the comment is erroneous. In the\n                    Opening Statement of the Respondent, it was averred that\n                    “the full details of the Respondent’s Defence\n                    are spelt from paragraphs 4 to 29 of his Affidavit Evidence\n                    in Chief”. In his Affidavit of Evidence in Chief\n                    (“AEIC”), the Respondent deposed at [11], in reference to the\n                    $2,000 cash payment, that “[t]he Complainant paid\n                    $2,000 as part of my agreed fees of $3,000 and he said that\n                    he would pay the balance of my fees after the matter is\n                    completed. I agreed.” Again at [13], the Respondent\n                    stated “I submit that the Complainant was satisfied\n                    with my work and agreed to my fees of$3,000” (emphasis in original). As\n                    regards the $3,000 cheque payment, the Respondent stated at\n                        [18] that\n                        “I told him that my fees [are]\n                        $3,000 for the maintenance summons... The\n                    Complainant agreed...” (emphasis in original). Given\n                    the above, we have to be satisfied that this erroneous\n                    perception of the Respondent did not unfairly colour the\n                    DT’s assessment of the evidence of the\n                    Respondent. 40     Having said that, the\n                    burden is on the Respondent to prove that he had clearly and\n                    unambiguously informed the Complainant that the two sums\n                    paid would be his agreed fees for the two matters. As far as\n                    the Complainant was concerned, he thought that he was\n                    required to and so paid the two sums as deposits towards the\n                    account of the Respondent’s fees in the two matters.\n                    However, even both the Respondent and Mr Tan (a witness for\n                    the Respondent) had described the sums as “only an\n                    advance or initial payment”,[note: 10]“an initial\n                    fee for the maintenance”,[note: 11]and\n                    “initial advance fee”[note: 12]etc, words which\n                    leave uncertainty as to what was exactly agreed. This is\n                    really the difficulty confronting the Respondent’s\n                    case. Where an agreed fee is not for handling the entire\n                    matter, it is vitally important that what is covered by that\n                    fee should be explicitly set out and agreed. His confusion\n                    can be seen from the following\n                        cross-examination:[note: 13] QNo, no, no, that’s not a\n                            question of whether he knows. I’m asking you,\n                            was there a discussion that your fee would be,\n                            let’s say, $10,000 for the ancillary divorce\n                            matters? Was there a discussion along those\n                            lines? ANo, because we---we are not at\n                            that point that we are not in the stage to tell\n                            the---the---the client how much would be\n                            the---the---the final fees lah, because the thing\n                            may go for trial, the thing may not. So we---we---we\n                            will tell him, “Look, if the thing\n                            don’t go for trial, this is 3,000, we will\n                            cover. But if the thing go for trial, we will just\n                            inform you, see.” If---if at that point in\n                            time we start telling him a sum, it---it---it will\n                            be an unrealistic sum, and it will be speculative\n                            sum. So we normally don’t. Hmm? … QYes, thank you, Mr Tay. So in\n                            short, you are saying that there was no agreement at\n                            that meeting as to the final sum---as to the final\n                            figure---final fee for handling the ancillary\n                            divorce matters. Is that correct? ANo agreement at final, but there\n                            was an agreement that 3,000 initial fees should be\n                            paid before---on---on and or be---on or before we\n                            start the case. QYes. AThat istowardsprofessional\n                        fee. (emphasis added) The First Charge 41     The DT found that the\n                    $3,000 was meant to be the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency\n                    Fee, and there was no subsequent agreement to convert the\n                    $3,000 into an agreed fee.[note: 14] 42     Although the DT did not\n                    specify what evidence on which it relied in making that\n                    determination, the cross-examination of the Respondent made\n                    clear that no agreement could have been reached as to the\n                    fees. The Respondent himself claimed that the meeting where\n                    the fee agreement was allegedly made lasted “less\n                    than 5 minutes” and took place when he “was\n                    walking out [of his] door” while the Complainant was\n                    going in.[note: 15]According to the\n                    Respondent, the way in which he described to the Complainant\n                    the conversion of the Divorce Ancillaries Contingency Fee of\n                    $3,000 into a fee agreement for the Maintenance Summons was\n                    as follows: Look, if like that the hearing, the\n                            next one, 2 days I have to use this money to---the\n                            3,000 for, er, the cheque for this other payment,\n                            you see...Then the other one I will---I will ask you\n                            later lah when the---when there’s a need you\n                            see. 43     It is difficult to\n                    understand what the above spiel was even meant to\n                    communicate, let alone come to an informed, reasoned fee\n                    agreement based on that. Indeed, the Respondent claims that\n                    in his hurry, he had erroneously written “initial\n                    payment for MSS941/2009” on the receipt for the\n                    $2,000 cash payment,[note: 16]when according to him\n                    he should have written that the payment was for the Divorce\n                    Ancillaries. The fact that the Respondent was in such a\n                    rush, that he made such a crucial mistake, the little time\n                    which he had talking to the Complainant and the lack of\n                    intelligibility and clarity in what he said to the\n                    Complainant, leave us in great doubt as to whether there\n                    could have been an informed and reasoned fee agreement made\n                    at the time. 44     Accordingly we do not\n                    think that it has been shown that the DT’s finding\n                    with respect to the First Charge is erroneous. We would\n                    affirm it. The Second Charge 45     In relation to the Second\n                    Charge, the DT made its finding on the basis of the\n                    following evidence: (a)     The receipt\n                        issued by the Respondent for the $2,000 stated that it\n                        was “initial payment” for\n                            “MSS941/2009”,[note: 17]not an agreed\n                        fee; (b)     The Respondent’s unsigned and\n                        undated Bill No. B09-26teo also did not state that the\n                        $2,000 was an agreed fee;[note: 18]and (c)     The Complainant\n                        stated in his AEIC that he was asked to pay the $2,000\n                        as a deposit.[note: 19] 46     We note that in\n                    cross-examination the Complainant agreed that the\n                    “$2,000 is part-costs for the ancillary\n                        matter”.[note: 20]But it could hardly follow\n                    from this admission that there was therefore an agreement\n                    between them as to a fixed fee for the Respondent handling\n                    the Divorce Ancillaries. There is a leap in logic. Even\n                    accepting, as the Respondent now alleges, that in issuing\n                    the receipt for the $2,000 cash payment he had wrongly\n                    stated the “cause” for which the payment was\n                    intended,ie, it should be the\n                    Divorce Ancillaries rather than the Maintenance Summons,\n                    this still leaves open the question as to why he did not\n                    state that that the payment was part payment of an agreed\n                    fee instead of stating that it was “initial\n                    payment”, an expression which can hardly connote an\n                    agreed fee. Equally pertinent to note is that the\n                    Respondent’s unsigned and undated Bill No. B09-26teo\n                    also did not state that the $2,000 was payment towards an\n                    agreed fee or part payment of an agreed fee. In this\n                    connection, we would hasten to add that a lay client would\n                    not likely know about the intricacies concerning the\n                    accounts of a solicitor and which particular account his\n                    payments to the solicitor should rightly be deposited into.\n                    It is clear that the SA Rules were promulgated to protect\n                    the interests of clients. It is vitally important that the\n                    solicitor should make it absolutely clear to the client as\n                    to the nature of the client’s payment. The burden is\n                    on the Respondent to prove that the client understood the\n                    nature of the payment which the client was required to make\n                    to the solicitor. 47     In the result, we do not\n                    think that there is sufficient basis for us to disturb the\n                    DT’s finding with respect to the Second\n                Charge. Issue 4: Whether the third\n                    charge has been made out 48     The Third Charge centred\n                    on the scope of r 35(a) of the\n                    PC Rules which reads: An advocate and solicitor shall inform the client\n                        – (a)    of the basis on which fees for\n                            professional services will be charged and the manner\n                            in which it is expected that those fees and\n                            disbursements, if any, shall be paid by the\n                            client… 49     The question whether or\n                    not a solicitor has complied with r 35(a) of the PC Rules is very much a question\n                    of fact. It seems to us clear that the object behind the\n                    rule is to ensure transparency in the way a solicitor\n                    charges his client. InChua Swee\n                        Keng, which concerned the payment of overtime\n                    fees, it was held by the DC that it was sufficient for the\n                    solicitor to have explained that overtime would be payable\n                    for her staff, stating her overtime rates, and providing a\n                    detailed breakdown of overtime charge. 50     In relation to the present\n                    case and the First Charge, for the reasons discussed at[41]to[44]above, the Respondent\n                    could not have adequately informed the Complainant of the\n                    basis on which his professional fees were or would be\n                    charged. 51     As regards the Third\n                    Charge, the DT reached its conclusion based ,inter alia, on the following\n                    evidence: (a)     The\n                        Complainant’s AEIC and oral\n                    evidence; (b)     The Respondent’s concession\n                        that he did not explain the basis and manner of his\n                            fees;[note: 21] (c)     The\n                        Respondent’s admission that he had not replied to\n                        any of the Complainant’s letters.[note: 22] 52     The Respondent has not\n                    persuaded us as to why the DT’s conclusion was wrong.\n                    The only explanation the Respondent provided for not having\n                    explained to the Complainant the basis on which his fees\n                    were charged were that the $3,000 was a lump sum payment,\n                    “there were no overtime charges or related fees which\n                    called for an explanation from the Respondent”, and\n                    that no explanation of hourly rates were needed because\n                    “he did not have the practice of charging by the\n                        hour”.[note: 23]This does not quite answer\n                    the question. The Respondent could have explained the\n                    breakdown of what fees were charged for each stage of the\n                    proceedings right up to just before trial, such as discovery\n                    of means and assets, preparation of AEIC and so on. All that\n                    the Respondent could say was that “$3,000 was a fixed\n                    fee for all the work to be done by the Respondent up to the\n                    resolution of the matter before trial”.[note: 24]This is hardly transparent enough for a client to be\n                    sufficiently informed. Further, for the reasons which this\n                    court in[37]to[47]above has ruled\n                    that there was no agreed fees between the Complainant and\n                    the Respondent on the two matters entrusted by the\n                    Complainant to the Respondent, the Respondent’s\n                    assertion that he had clearly explained the basis of his fee\n                    charge to the Complainant leaves us in considerable doubt as\n                    to the transparency of the explanation. Considered as a\n                    whole, we find the Respondent’s evidence and\n                    explanations unsatisfactory. 53     Again, there is\n                    insufficient basis for this court to interfere with the\n                    DT’s findings with respect to the Third\n                Charge.",

The misconduct inAndre\n                        Arulrelated to overcharging under\n                        s 83(2)(b) of the LPA\n                    (grossly improper conduct). The court explained at [36] that: This [monetary] penalty was introduced to enable\n                        the court of three judges to impose fines for\n                        disciplinary offences that are too serious to be\n                        punished with mere censures, but insufficiently serious\n                        to deserve the punishment of suspension from practice.\n                        In our view, the disciplinary offence of overcharging\n                        amounting to grossly improper conduct falls within this\n                        category of disciplinary offences, provided no deception\n                        or dishonesty is involved.We hold\n                            that the starting point in imposing a proportionate\n                            penalty for overcharging amounting to grossly\n                            improper conduct should be a fine in the first\n                            instance, and not a suspension of the errant lawyer\n                            from practice.A fine, especially a heavy\n                        fine, together with payment of the disciplinary\n                        tribunal's and the Law Society's costs in the\n                        proceedings, should generally be an adequate punishment\n                        for the errant solicitor. Repeat offenders will, of\n                        course, be penalised more severely. [emphasis added] 58     The court also provided\n                    guidance as to when suspension is warranted: where the\n                    offence in question is “redolent\n                        of cheating or deceiving the client”\n                    (at [38]). Further,\n                    striking the solicitor off the roll is justified only\n                        “[i]n the most egregious cases\n                        where cheating is involved(such as where there are fabricated bills or invoices\n                        for work which has not in fact been\n                    done)” (at [39]). 59     It is clear, therefore,\n                    that the distinguishing factor between an offence that\n                    warrants a monetary penalty and one that warrants suspension\n                    or disbarment is the element ofdishonestyordeceit. Gross negligence may or may not be\n                    sufficient; it will have to depend on the overall\n                    circumstances. Do they come close to dishonesty? Where\n                    dishonesty or deceit on the solicitor’s part is not\n                    made out, the starting point should be a monetary\n                    penalty. 60     Counsel for the Law\n                    Society relied heavily onPrem\n                        Singh, where the court of three judges\n                    imposed a two-year suspension for a solicitor’s\n                    failure to place client moneys into a client account, as\n                    required under r 3 of the SA Rules. The court stated at\n                        [22]: Rule 3 of the Legal Profession (Solicitors’\n                        Accounts) Rules prescribes a mandatory requirement that\n                        the client’s funds be placed into a separate\n                        account. The purpose of this rule is to protect the\n                        public and to instil public confidence in solicitors...\n                        In our opinion, the respondent’s omission to place\n                        the funds in his client account was a serious breach of\n                        the Legal Profession (Solicitors’ Accounts)\n                        Rules. 61     We agree that such\n                    omission to place client moneys into a client account\n                    constitutes a serious breach of the Rules, and may\n                    constitute grossly improper conduct under s 83(2)(b) of the LPA. The past precedents\n                    show that, prior to the 2008 amendment, the court would\n                    invariably, impose a suspension even where no dishonesty is\n                    proven or even alleged (Tan Sok\n                        Ling). The case ofTan\n                        Chwee Wan Allanis instructive. In that case,\n                    the court of three judges found at [53] that: There was no suggestion that the respondent had\n                        behaved dishonestly. This was essentially a case of\n                        professional oversight as a result of the\n                        respondent’s sheer carelessness and inadvertence\n                        in relation to staff supervision and the management of\n                        his clients’ accounts. 62     The court ordered the\n                    respondent to be censured and imposed an undertaking on the\n                    respondent not to practise as a sole proprietor for a period\n                    of two years.Tan Chwee Wan\n                        Allanis a perfect example of a case where\n                    the court, unarmed with the enhanced sentencing options\n                    under the new s 83 of the LPA, sought to temper justice with\n                    mercy by ordering only a censure and imposing an undertaking\n                    not to practise as a sole proprietor. The 2008 amendments\n                    were designed to bridge the cavernous gulf between a censure\n                    and suspension or disbarment. 63     In our view, this is an\n                    appropriate case to impose a monetary penalty. In the\n                    circumstances of this case, the Third Charge is really\n                    incidental to the First and Second Charges. While we note\n                    that the Respondent has not pleaded guilty to the charges,\n                    we are satisfied that he resisted the charges out of a bona\n                    fide conviction, although we have held his belief to be\n                    wrong, that he had reached an understanding with the client\n                    on fees. It was also clear that there was no dishonesty or\n                    deceit involved in what he did. If he had really thought\n                    that he had done wrong with regard to his treatment of the\n                    client’s payments, he would have wasted no time to\n                    satisfy the demand of the client for a refund of the $3,000\n                    which the client sought. Although failure to put client\n                    moneys into a client account is a serious breach,\n                    irrespective of the amount involved – and the two\n                    amounts here were small – in our judgment a monetary\n                    penalty in this case would be sufficient to satisfy the\n                    considerations of “the importance of protection of\n                    the public and maintaining public confidence in the manner\n                    in which client’s money is to be handled and\n                    safeguarded by members of the legal profession”\n                        (Prem Singhat [24]). 64     In considering the\n                    appropriate quantum of monetary penalty to be imposed on the\n                    Respondent there is a need to address the gravity and nature\n                    of the Respondent’s misconduct in contradistinction\n                    with the misconduct inAndre\n                        Arul. Even absent dishonesty or deceit, the\n                    misconduct of overcharging inAndre\n                        Arulinvolved theintentionto charge a client more than what\n                    was fair and necessary. However, the situation here of the\n                    Respondent putting the two sums of client money into an\n                    office account is quite different in that it was borne of a\n                    mistaken belief, rather than an intention to do an act that\n                    is manifestly improper. Further, one other factor must also\n                    be borne in mind – the sums involved inAndre Aruland those of the present\n                    case. InAndre Arulthe court\n                    accepted the DT’s decision that a reasonable sum would\n                    have been about $75,000, while the solicitor in fact charged\n                    more than $226,000 – a differential of about $151,000\n                    (at [40]). In this\n                    case, the wrong only involved two small sums of $2,000 and\n                    $3,000. Having regard to thegravityandnatureof the misconduct, as well as thepotential loss or injuryto the client had the solicitor not been brought to task, it\n                    is clear to us that the gravity of the misconduct committed\n                    by the Respondent here is certainly lighter than that inAndre Arulwhere a penalty\n                    of $50,000 was imposed. Accordingly, we would impose a\n                    penalty of $15,000. This should suffice as a specific as\n                    well as a general deterrence.",
        "Conclusion": "65     In the result, cause\n                    having been shown, we order the Respondent to pay a penalty\n                    of $15,000.
