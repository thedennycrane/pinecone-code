        "1.   Introduction": "1       This application raises two issues: first, whether the\n                    Singapore Exchange Securities Trading Limited’s\n                    (“SGX-ST”) public reprimand of a\n                    director of an SGX-ST listed company is susceptible to\n                    judicial review? And second, if it is, whether the applicant\n                    was accorded a fair hearing as required by the rules of\n                    natural justice? 2       The applicant, who was, during the material time, a\n                    non-executive director of China Sky Fibre Chemical Limited\n                    (“China Sky” or\n                    “Company”), applied for leave to apply\n                    for a quashing order of the SGX-ST’s reprimand of\n                    him, on 16 December 2011 (“SGX-ST\n                    Reprimand”) and was granted leave. The gist of\n                    his complaint is that SGX-ST reprimanded him in breach of\n                    the rules of natural justice.",
        "2.   Judicial Review": "3       Judicial review is the limited means through which the\n                    court holds bodies exercising a “public” function to fundamental\n                    thresholds of legality. It is to be emphasised that in\n                    judicial review the court is not concerned with the merits\n                    or correctness of the decision under review. Judicial review\n                    is not an appeal to the court nor does the court substitute\n                    its own judgment for that of the decision-maker. In the\n                    exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction, the court confines\n                    itself to reviewing the decision making process, to ensure\n                    that the process met the standards of “legality,\n                    rationality and procedural propriety” (per\n                    Lord Diplock inCouncil of Civil\n                        Service Union v. Minis    ter for the Civil\n                        Services[1985] A.C. 374).\n                    Since judicial review is confined to decisions which are\n                    characterised as being of a public function, it is\n                    unavailable for the enforcement of private law rights, for\n                    which private law and other court processes are readily\n                    available.",
        "3.   Is the SGX-ST’s Reprimand\n                susceptible to Judicial Review?": "4       The foundations of Singapore law on judicial review are\n                    the common law principles as they have developed in England\n                    prior to the influence and impact of the European Union law,\n                    the latter having no application to Singapore. Accordingly\n                    it is necessary for this court to return to the pre-1972\n                    bedrock judicial review principles, and to apply those\n                    principles to the present case. In considering post-1972\n                    judicial review decisions in England, care has to be taken\n                    to extract only those common law principles where these\n                    principles have not morphed into English law judicial review\n                    principles as a result of European Union law, such as the\n                    European Convention on Human Rights which was incorporated\n                    into English law by the 1998 UK Human Rights Act. A similar\n                    cautionary approach is warranted when considering judicial\n                    review decisions by the Australian courts which have been\n                    shaped by the Australian Administrative Decisions (Judicial\n                    Review) Act 1977 which has no application to\n                    Singapore. 5       Michael Fordham,Judicial Review\n                        Handbook, 2nd ed, 1997 (at\n                    p 5) provides a useful bird’s eye\n                    distillation of the court’s approach to judicial\n                    review at pages 145, 148 and 172: Judicial review is: the means by which High Court\n                        judges scrutinise public law functions, intervening as a\n                        matter of discretion, to quash, prevent, require,\n                        clarify or compensate, not because they disagree with\n                        the merits judgment, but so as to right a recognisable\n                        public law wrong, whether, unlawfulness,\n                        unreasonableness or unfairness. The applicant is a\n                        person with sufficient interest, who lacks any suitable\n                        alternative remedy, and who must commence proceedings\n                        promptly.” “Judicial review is a\n                        contextual, discretionary jurisdiction which is changing\n                        dramatically and incrementally. (At\n                        p. 145) Courts promote their interventionist capacities,\n                        driven by the rule of law and aversion to inconsistency\n                        and abuse: Judicial review is the Courts’ way\n                        of enforcing the rule of law: ensuring that public\n                        decision-making is undertaken according to law and is\n                        accountable to law. In other words, reminding public\n                        bodies that they are not above the law. (At\n                        p.148) Courts adopt a primary deference, preserving for\n                        public bodies a margin of responsibility and choice:\n                        Public decision-makers exist for a purpose and there\n                        must necessarily be questions which it are for them,\n                        rather than judges, to decide. Principles of judicial review are a Court-struck\n                        balance, faithful to both vigilance and restraint: The\n                        tension between vigilance and restraint is a main\n                        undercurrent of judicial review, responsible for\n                        producing the principles which govern the supervisory\n                        jurisdiction. (At p.172) 6       The foundational common law principles in England have as\n                    their starting point the source test (“Source\n                    Test”), which was then extended by the nature\n                    test (“Nature Test”) to take into\n                    account the changing public governance landscape. The\n                    development from the statutory Source Test where the court\n                    looks to whether the body had its origins in statutes, to\n                    the Nature Test where the court looks at the nature of the\n                    decision, is discernable in the following sequence of the\n                    seminal English judgments. InReg v\n                        Criminal Injuries Compensation Board,Ex parte Lain[1967]\n                    2 QB 864,perLord Parker CJ at 882\n                    where he describes the limits of the origins of certiorari,\n                    (today the quashing order): ... They have varied from time to time being extended\n                        to meet changing conditions. At one time the writ only\n                        went to an inferior court. Later its ambit was extended\n                        to statutory tribunals determining alisinterpartes.\n                        Later again it extended to cases where there was nolisin the strict\n                        sense of the word but where immediate or subsequent\n                        rights of a citizen were affected. The only constant\n                        limits throughout were that it was performing a public\n                        duty. Private or domestic tribunals have always been\n                        outside the scope of certiorari since their authority is\n                        derived solely from contract, that is, from the\n                        agreement of the parties concerned. ... We have, as it\n                        seems to me reached the position when the ambit of\n                        certiorari can be said to cover every case in which a\n                        body of persons of a public as opposed to a purely\n                        private or domestic character has to determine matters\n                        affecting subjects provided always that it has a duty to\n                        act judicially. Looked at in this way the board in my\n                        judgment comes fairly and squarely within the\n                        jurisdiction of this court... 7       At 884 to 885, Diplock LJ observed: ... If new tribunals are established by acts of\n                        government, the supervisory jurisdiction of the High\n                        Court extends to them if they possess the essential\n                        characteristics upon which the subjection of inferior\n                        tribunal to the supervisory control of the High Court is\n                        based. What are these characteristics? It is plain on\n                        the authorities that the tribunal need not be one whose\n                        determinations give rise directly to any legally\n                        enforceable right or liability. Its determination may be\n                        subject to certiorari notwithstanding that it is merely\n                        one step in the process which may have the result of\n                        altering the legal rights or liabilities of a person to\n                        whom it relates... 8       InReg v Panel on Take-overs and\n                        Mergers, ex parteDatafin\n                        plc And Another[1987]\n                    1 QB 815 (“Datafin”), Sir John\n                    Donaldson MR described the same development in the\n                    following manner at 838: ... The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, in the\n                        form which it then took, was an administrative novelty.\n                        Accordingly it would have been impossible to find a\n                        precedent for the exercise of the supervisory\n                        jurisdiction of the court which fitted the facts.\n                        Nevertheless the court not only asserted its\n                        jurisdiction, but further asserted that it was a\n                        jurisdiction which was adaptable thereafter. ...In all\n                        the reports it is possible to find enumerations of\n                        factors giving rise to the jurisdiction but it is a\n                        fatal error to regard the presence of all those factors\n                        as essential or as being exclusive of other factors.\n                        Possibly the only essential elements are what can be\n                        described as a public element, which can take many\n                        forms, and the exclusion from the jurisdiction of bodies\n                        whosesolesource of\n                        power is a consensual submission to its\n                        jurisdiction... [emphasis added] 9       In the modern era, public policy is increasingly effected\n                    not only by government and statutory bodies but also through\n                    self-regulating entities in sectors where the domain nature\n                    and complexity of the sector requires front- line expertise\n                    coupled with back-line regulators to regulate the relevant\n                    sector. The question arose in England inDatafin, with respect to the then newly\n                    created London Panel on Take-overs which operated the City\n                    Code on Take-overs and Mergers (“London\n                    Panel”). The legal question there (and in this\n                    application) was succinctly framed by Sir John\n                    Donaldson inDatafinat 828 in the following terms: … whether the courts of this country have\n                        any jurisdiction to control the activities of a body\n                        which de facto exercises what can only be characterised\n                        as powers in the nature of public law powers... 10     While the London Panel “oversees and regulates\n                    a very important function of the United Kingdom financial\n                    market ... [it performs] this function without visible means\n                    of legal support” (seeDatafinat 824). The court also noted that the London\n                    Panel had no “statutory, prerogative or common\n                    law powers and it is not in a contractual relationship with\n                    the financial market or those who deal in that\n                    market” (seeDatafinat 825). 11     While lacking statutory authority, Sir John\n                    Donaldson MR noted (at 826) that the\n                    Panel: … exercises immense powerde factoby devising,\n                        promulgating, amending and interpreting the City Code on\n                        Take-overs and Mergers, by waiving or modifying of the\n                        code in particular circumstances, by investigating and\n                        reporting upon the alleged breaches of the code and by\n                        application or threat of sanctions. These sanctions are\n                        no less effective because they are applied indirectly\n                        and lack a legally enforceable base. ... The unspoken assumption, which I do not doubt is a\n                        reality, is that the Department of Trade and Industry\n                        or, as the case may be, the Stock Exchange or other\n                        appropriate body would in fact exercise statutory powers\n                        or contractual powers to penalise the\n                        transgressors. 12     Sir John Donaldson MR was mindful that financial markets\n                    required speed and certainty of decisions. He agreed with\n                    the observation of Lord Diplock inReg v Inland Revenue Commissioners, Ex parte\n                        National Federation of Self-Employed and Small\n                        Businesses Ltd[1982] AC 617 at 642\n                    to 643 that in the context of judicial review of\n                    such decisions, the procedural need to apply for leave for\n                    prerogative orders would: ... prevent the time of the court being wasted by\n                        busybodies with misguided or trivial complaints of\n                        administrative error, and to remove the uncertainty in\n                        which public officers and authorities might be left as\n                        to whether they could safely proceed with administrative\n                        action while proceedings for judicial review of it were\n                        actually pending even though misconceived. In many cases of judicial review where the time scale\n                        is far more extended than in the financial markets, the\n                        decision-maker who learns that someone is seeking leave\n                        to challenge his decision may well seek to preserve the\n                        status quo meanwhile and, in particular, may not seek to\n                        enforce the decision pending a consideration of the\n                        matter by the court. If leave is granted, the court has\n                        the necessary authority to make orders designed to\n                        achieve this result, but usually the decision-maker will\n                        give undertakings in lieu. All this is but good\n                        administrative practice. However, against the background\n                        of the time scales of the financial market, the courts\n                        would not expect the panel or those who should comply\n                        with its decisions to act similarly. In that context the\n                        panel and those affected should treat its decisions as\n                        valid and binding, unless and until they are set aside.\n                        Above all they should ignore any application for leave\n                        to apply of which they become aware, since to do\n                        otherwise would enable such applications to be used as a\n                        mere ploy in take-over battles which would be a serious\n                        abuse of process of the court and could not be\n                        adequately penalised by awards of costs. [p.840] 13     The observations of Lloyd LJ inDatafin (at 847)on the\n                    spectrum between a statutory source and\n                    contractual/consensual private decision-makers are also\n                    instructive: ...If the source of the power is a statute, or\n                        subordinate legislation under a statute, then clearly\n                        the body in question will be subject to judicial review.\n                        If, at the other end of the scale, the source of power\n                        is contractual, as in the case of private arbitration,\n                        then clearly the arbitrator is not subject to judicial\n                        review: seeReg. v National Joint\n                            Council for the Craft of Dental\n                            Technicians(Dispute\n                            Committee),Ex parteNeate[1953] 1 QB 704. But in between these extremes there is an area in\n                        which it is helpful to look not just at the source of\n                        the power but at the nature of the power. If the body in\n                        question is exercising public law functions, or if the\n                        exercise of its functions have public law consequences,\n                        then that maybe sufficient to bring the body within the\n                        reach of judicial review. It may be said that to refer\n                        to “public law” in this context is\n                        to beg the question. But I do not think it does. The\n                        essential distinction, which runs through all the cases\n                        to which we referred, is between a domestic or private\n                        tribunal on the one hand and a body of persons who are\n                        under some public duty on the other. 14     However, Lloyd LJ noted at 848 that to hold that\n                    the Source Test was the sole test of whether a decision is\n                    subject to judicial review would be to impose an artificial\n                    limit on the developing law of judicial review. He concluded\n                    that, quite apart from the Source Test, the court would also\n                    apply the Nature Test. In the event that he was wrong and if\n                    the only test applicable was the Source Test,\n                    Lloyd LJ was prepared to consider that the London\n                    Panel was established “under the authority of the\n                    Government” such that it satisfied the Source\n                    Test (at 849). 15     This process of development of the law of judicial review\n                    is summarised in the following terms byJudicial Remedies in Public Law, Clive\n                    Lewis QC (Sweet & Maxwell 2009)\n                    at para 2-003: In the past, the courts focussed primarily on the\n                        source of the power in determining whether a body was a\n                        public one subject to judicial review. Now, however, the\n                        modern approach is to consider whether the exercise of a\n                        power, or performance of a duty involves a\n                        “public element”, which can take\n                        many different forms, and the exclusion from\n                        jurisdiction of bodies whosesolesource of power is a consensual\n                        submission to its jurisdiction.” The source\n                        of a power or duty remains an important indication of\n                        the public law nature of a body or bodies created by\n                        statute or acting under powers derived from the\n                        prerogative will usually be public law bodies for the\n                        purposes of judicial review.Other\n                            non-statutory bodies may, however, be performing\n                            public law functions and may be subject to judicial\n                            review in respect of those functions. Factors such\n                            as the nature of the function, the extent to which\n                            there is any statutory recognition or underpinning\n                            of the body or the function in question and the\n                            extent to which the body has been interwoven into a\n                            system of governmental regulation may indicate that\n                            the body performs public functions and is, in\n                            principle, subject to judicial review in respect of\n                            those function.The principal exclusion\n                        from the scope of judicial review now is bodies who\n                        acquire jurisdiction over individuals by virtue of\n                        contract. These are seen as private and not public\n                        bodies. [emphasis added] 16     The preceding account of the foundational common law\n                    judicial review principles demonstrates the vitality of the\n                    common law in upholding the rule of law by adjusting to meet\n                    changing public governance landscapes. Only where the sole\n                    source of a decision-maker’s power is contractual\n                    or consensual would such decision-maker not be susceptible\n                    to judicial review. 17     In Singapore, our courts have inPublic\n                        Service Commission v Lai Swee Lin Linda[2001] 1 SLR 644,UDL\n                        Marine (Singapore) Pte Ltd v Jurong Town Corp[2011] 3 SLR 94 andACC\n                        v CIT[2010] 1 SLR 273,\n                    applied both the Source Test and the Nature Test.",
        "The Regulatory Structure and Framework of the\n                Singapore Securities and Futures Market": "18     As SGX-ST is not a statutory body, I proceed next to\n                    analyse the following factors in this order, the extent to\n                    which it is interwoven into the legislative and regulatory\n                    matrix, whether the reprimand function has a statutory\n                    underpinning and finally its nature, to determine whether\n                    the SGX-ST Reprimand isto be characterised as a public\n                    function within the Nature Test. (i)   Legislative and regulatory\n                matrix 19     The primary statutory regulator of the securities and\n                    futures market in Singapore under the Securities &\n                    Futures Act (Cap 289, 2006 Rev Ed)\n                    (“SFA”), is the Monetary Authority of\n                    Singapore (the “MAS”). Its securities\n                    and futures regulatory powers and functions are described\n                    below [20- 21]. The SGX-ST is a company incorporated under\n                    the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev. Ed). The\n                    SGX-ST operates a securities market, whilst the Singapore\n                    Exchange Derivatives Trading Ltd\n                    (“SGX-DT”) operates a futures and\n                    derivatives market. Both SGX-ST and SGX-DT are approved\n                    exchanges and are held by Singapore Exchange Ltd, an\n                    approved holding company of both SGX-ST and SGX-DT under\n                    s 81U SFA. 20     The SGX-ST describes itself in its website in the\n                    following terms: SGX as a Self Regulatory Organisation The SGX is a listed exchange and frontline regulator.\n                        SGX is considered a self regulatory organization\n                        (“an SRO”). SGX bears commercial\n                        responsibilities in addition to its regulatory\n                        duties.” Regulatory Organization Structure SGX undertakes various regulatory functions to promote\n                        a fair, orderly and transparent marketplace as well as a\n                        safe and efficient clearing system. These functions are\n                        handled by the following regulatory departments: Issuer Regulation Catalist Regulation Member Supervision Market Surveillance Enforcement Risk Management Clearing Risk Regulatory Development & Policy 21     SGX-ST is an approved exchange under s 16 of the\n                    SFA. S 16(1)(c) SFA provides that an approved exchange in\n                    discharging its obligations under the SFA is to have\n                    particular regard to the interests of the investing public,\n                    and is not to act contrary to the interests of the public.\n                    S16(1)(e) obliges it to maintain business and listing rules\n                    which make satisfactory provision for a fair, orderly and\n                    transparent market in securities that are traded, and to\n                    regulate and supervise its members.\n                    Section 16(1)(f) SFA provides that it is to enforce\n                    compliance with its business and listing rules. Amendments\n                    to its business and listing rules may be directed by and in\n                    any event require the approval of MAS. Section 24\n                    SFA expressly provides that the business rules of the\n                    approved exchange shall be deemed to be and operate as a\n                    binding contract between the exchange and each member and\n                    the membersinter se.\n                    S 25 SFA, introduces a statutory enforcement\n                    process under which the SGX-ST’s business or\n                    listing rules may be enforced or effected further by a court\n                    order issued to the company or its associated persons.\n                    Acquisitions of defined minimum thresholds of substantial\n                    shareholdings in SGX-ST require prior MAS approval under\n                    s 27 SFA. In an emergency, the MAS is accorded\n                    emergency powers to direct SGX-ST to take prescribed actions\n                    under s 34 SFA. The appointments of\n                    SGX-ST’s chairman, chief executive and directors\n                    of the SGX-ST require the prior approval of the MAS under\n                    s 28 SFA. The listing of the SGX-ST itself requires\n                    the MAS’s approval under s 30 SFA. The\n                    MAS is empowered under s 46 SFA to issue directions\n                    to the SGX-ST, on pain of a criminal offence for\n                    non-compliance. (ii)   Statutory underpinning of the reprimand\n                function 22     The SFA prescribes that the SGX membership and listing\n                    rules are to satisfactorily provide a fair, orderly and\n                    transparent market for the trading of listed securities. A\n                    fair and transparent market is contingent on the timely and\n                    accurate disclosure of material information. A review of\n                    SGX-ST’s Listing Manual reveals a two-pronged\n                    approach to ensuring a fair and transparent market for\n                    trading of listed securities. 23     The first approach is to impose on the listed company the\n                    obligation to comply with the Listing Manual and to make\n                    timely, continuing and periodic disclosures, as prescribed\n                    in SGX-ST’s Listing Manual Chapter 7\n                    “Continuing Obligations”. This Chapter\n                    7 contains Part II “Equity Securities-Immediate\n                    Announcements” and Part III “Equity\n                    Securities-Periodic Reports”. This corporate\n                    disclosure obligation is underscored by the\n                    Company’s Listing Undertaking issued to the SGX-ST\n                    under authority of a board resolution. Where the listed\n                    company defaults or contravenes these continuing disclosure\n                    obligations, SGX-ST Listing Manual Chapter 13\n                    provides for trading halts, suspension and delisting.\n                    Rule 1302 enables the Exchange to grant a trading\n                    halt to enable an issuer to disclose material information or\n                    suspend trading at the request of the issuer. Suspension of\n                    trading may be imposed by the Exchange where an issuer is\n                    unable or unwilling to comply with or contravenes a listing\n                    rule. Rule 1305 provides that the Exchange may delist an\n                    issuer by removing an issuer from its Official List if it is\n                    unable or unwilling to comply with, or contravenes a listing\n                    rule. 24     The second approach is consonant with developments in\n                    other global stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock\n                    Exchange:i.e.the SGX-ST has\n                    introduced powers to publicly reprimand executive and\n                    non-executive directors of listed companies for\n                    non-compliance with the Listing Manual. The second approach\n                    is expressed in SGX-ST’s Listing Manual,\n                    Part IV “Equity Securities-Other\n                    Obligations”. Rule 720(4), which was\n                    introduced in 2011, provides: Where the Exchange is of the opinion that a director\n                        or key executive officer of an issuer has: (a)    wilfully contravened or wilfully caused the\n                                issuer to breach the Listing Rues; or (b)    wilfully contravened any relevant laws, rules\n                                and regulations; or (c)    refused to extend cooperation to the Exchange\n                                or other regulatory agencies in an investigation\n                                of wrongdoing related to the issuer such that\n                                doubts are cast on the directors’\n                                ability to discharge their duties as\n                                directors, the Exchange may take the necessary actions including\n                        but not limited to:- Publishing the names of the individual directors or\n                        key executive officers with relevant information about\n                        the contravention or failure to extend cooperation;\n                        and Objecting to appointments of the individual directors\n                        or key executive officers to the board of directors of\n                        other issuers. It is not disputed that Rule 720 has been\n                    properly enacted and approved by the MAS in accordance with\n                    s 23 SFA. (iii)   Nature of reprimand function 25     A public reprimand of directors of a listed company by the\n                    SGX-ST, a front-line securities regulator, carries financial\n                    and business implications. Some of the possible implications\n                    may be gleaned from Lord Denning’s observations inRe Pergamon Press Ltd[1970] 3 All ER 535\n                        (“Re Pergamon\n                        Press”) in relation to\n                    inspectors’ reports issued by inspectors under the\n                    English Companies Act. While such inspectors only have\n                    powers to ‘investigate and report’, they\n                    may, … if they think fit, make findings of fact\n                        which are very damaging to those whom they name. They\n                        may accuse some; they may condemn others; they may ruin\n                        reputations or careers. Their report may lead to\n                        judicial proceedings. It may expose persons to criminal\n                        prosecutions or to civil actions. It may bring about the\n                        winding-up of the company... 26     InRe Pergamon Press, the\n                    English Court of Appeal considered and held that such\n                    inspectors were bound by the principles of natural justice.\n                    The English Court of Appeal then set a limited scope of fair\n                    hearing as being appropriate to the inspectors’\n                    function: before the inspectors could condemn or criticise a\n                    person, they must give the person a fair opportunity for\n                    correcting or contradicting what was said again him. 27     What then are the potential implications of a SGX-ST\n                    public reprimand of a listed company’s directors?\n                    SGX-ST is a vital part of the institutional ecosystem of\n                    Singapore’s financial sector. It operates an open\n                    and international securities market within the 24/7 global\n                    network of securities markets. SGX-ST’s public\n                    reprimand of a listed company’s directors\n                    accordingly may potentially impact a director domestically\n                    and internationally in several ways, depending on his\n                    background. These include: adverse business reputational\n                    implications, implications on their continued service on\n                    board committees and directorships of other listed companies\n                    and other professional and financial services licence\n                    implications. 28     In the light of the above, the legislative and regulatory\n                    matrix of the Singapore securities market, the statutory\n                    underpinning of the reprimand power and the nature of the\n                    reprimand function, the reprimand power would, in my view,\n                    properly be characterised as a public function within the\n                    Nature Test and consequently susceptible to judicial review\n                    for minimum compliance with the standards of\n                    “legality, rationality and procedural\n                    propriety”.",
        "4.   What is the scope of duty to act\n                fairly?": "29     The common law prescribes minimum standards of procedural\n                    propriety by requiring a fair hearing and the absence of\n                    bias. There is no one-size-fits-all template for a fair\n                    hearing. What constitutes a fair hearing depends on the\n                    nature and context of the decision. What then constitutes a\n                    fair hearing, when directors fail to comply with the\n                    relevant exchange listing rules to disclose material\n                    information, in the context of the securities market where\n                    the timely and accurate disclosure of material information\n                    is critical? 30     I find considerable guidance from\n                    Lord Mustill’s elaboration of the\n                    relevant factors, which are equally applicable regardless of\n                    whether the Source Test or the Nature Test is applicable.R v. Secretary of State for the Home\n                        Department, ex parteDoody[1994] 1 AC 531\n                    at 560 D-G: What does fairness require in the present case? My\n                        Lords, I think it unnecessary to refer by name or to\n                        quote from, any of the oft-cited authorities in which\n                        the courts have explained what is essentially an\n                        intuitive judgment. They are far too well known. From\n                        them, I derive that (1) where an Act of\n                        Parliament confers an administrative power there is a\n                        presumption that it will be exercised in a manner which\n                        is fair in all the circumstances. (2) the\n                        standards are not immutable. They may change with the\n                        passage of time, both in general and in their\n                        application to decisions of a particular type.\n                        (3) The principles of fairness are not to be\n                        applied by rote identically in every situation. What\n                        fairness demands is dependent on the context of the\n                        decision, and this is to be taken into account in all\n                        its aspects. (4) An essential feature of the\n                        context is the statute which creates the discretion, as\n                        regards both its language and the shape of the legal and\n                        administrative system within which the decision is\n                        taken. (5) Fairness will very often require\n                        that a person who may be adversely affected by the\n                        decision will have an opportunity to make\n                        representations on his own behalf either before the\n                        decision is taken with a view to producing a favourable\n                        result; or after it is taken, with a view to procuring\n                        its modification; of both. (6) Since the person\n                        affected usually cannot make worthwhile representations\n                        without knowing what factors may weigh against his\n                        interests fairness will very often require that he is\n                        informed of the gist of the case which he has to\n                        answer. 31     In short, fairness, in the context of disclosure of\n                    information in the securities market, requires that the\n                    person affected is informed of the case against him and that\n                    he has an opportunity to make representations before the\n                    decision.",
        "The unfolding chronology of events leading up to\n                the SGX-ST Reprimand": "32     It is the applicant’s case that the SGX-ST did\n                    not accord him with a fair hearing in that:\n                    (i) SGX-ST had not given him any notice or\n                    information that they were considering or intending to\n                    impose a sanction on him and (ii) SGX-ST should\n                    have informed him of the case against him and given him a\n                    right to be heard. 33     I next turn to set out the chronology of events leading to\n                    the SGX-ST’s reprimand of all the directors of\n                    China Sky on 16 December 2011, in order to evaluate\n                    whether the applicant had been given notice that SGX-ST\n                    intended to reprimand him, whether he was notified of the\n                    case against him and whether he had an opportunity to make\n                    representations. 34     China Sky is a company incorporated in the Cayman Islands.\n                    Its principal business is the manufacture and sale of\n                    chemical fibres.

        "April 2011: SGX-ST’s queries China\n                Sky’s Annual Report 2010": "36     The story unfolded in April 2011 when China Sky issued its\n                    Annual Report 2010 (“the AR 2010”).\n                    The SGX-ST reviewed the AR 2010, and having noticed several\n                    discrepancies, queried the Company on 19 April 2011\n                    and asked the Company to provide the information in an\n                    announcement. The primary matters relevant to this\n                    application are as follows: (collectively “the\n                    Discrepancies”): (a)     Not having previously reported any Interested Party\n                        Transactions (“IPTs”) in its\n                        Annual Reports for the financial years 2007, 2008 and\n                        2009, China Sky’s AR 2010 reported that the\n                        aggregate value of the IPTs for the financial year 2009\n                        was RMB 1.5 million (S$300,000) and for the\n                        financial year 2010 was RMB 866,000 (S$173,000). The AR\n                        2010 did not however reveal any particulars of these\n                        IPTs nor was the interested person(s) in these\n                        transactions identified (“the IPT\n                        Discrepancy”). (b)     China Sky’s AR 2010 reported that the Group\n                        had paid an unnamed third party (“the Third\n                        Party”), under an agreement signed in 2006, a\n                        RMB 149 million deposit. The Third Party would\n                        acquire the land use rights from the relevant Chinese\n                        authority and transfer such rights to the Group. China\n                        Sky’s AR 2010 reported that it had not yet\n                        obtained the land use rights certificate for this land.\n                        It also reported that it had paid a further deposit of\n                        RMB 114 million for construction work on this\n                        land. The AR 2010 did not reveal the identity of the\n                        Third Party, the details of the land, the reasons for\n                        payment notwithstanding non-receipt of the land use\n                        rights certificate or the reason for payment for\n                        construction on this same land prior to receipt of the\n                        certificate (“the Land\n                        Discrepancy”). 37     China Sky’s announcements on SGXNET on\n                    22 April 2011 generated further SGX-ST queries\n                    which led to the following Company announcements: (a)     That the previously reported IPT amounts had been\n                        erroneous and had to be revised downwards and that these\n                        were professional fees paid to SK Lai & Co, an\n                        accounting firm owned by Mr Lai Seng Kwoon, the Chairman\n                        of the Audit Committee and an independent\n                        director. (b)     That the Third Party in the land transaction was\n                        Fujian Fuyuan Chemical Fiber Co Ltd (“Fujian\n                        Fuyuan”), and that the RMB 114\n                        million paid for the construction on the land was\n                        non-refundable. It also disclosed that the Company had\n                        decided to defer its expansion and completion of the\n                        land acquisition in light of the global financial crisis\n                        of 2008/2009.",

SGX-ST issued a further query on\n                    27 April 2011 which led to another announcement on\n                    29 April 2011 which made further corrections and\n                    explanations. 39     On 2 May 2011 China Sky announced the appointment\n                    of the applicant as independent director and member of the\n                    reconstituted Audit Committee. On 3 May 2011, China\n                    Sky announced that in order to enhance their corporate\n                    governance practices, they had appointed Rodyk &\n                    Davidson as legal advisor to conduct a review of the\n                    existing corporate governance procedures to identify\n                    weaknesses and recommend measures to address them, and that\n                    the applicant would be overseeing the implementation of\n                    measures, if any, recommended by Rodyk &\n                    Davidson. 40     From 16 May 2011 until 16 November 2011,\n                    a period of six months, the SGX-ST sent repeated\n                    email requests for information, clarification and production\n                    of documents to China Sky’s CFO, many of which\n                    were copied to the CEO and to all the Audit Committee\n                    members. The CFO repeatedly replied assuring SGX-ST that the\n                    Company would provide the documents requested and attempted\n                    to arrange for the CEO and the Audit Committee members to\n                    meet SGX-ST’s officers to discuss the matter\n                    face-to-face. Notwithstanding these assurances, no documents\n                    relating to the Land Discrepancy were provided to the\n                    SGX-ST. 41     On 14 June 2011, China Sky’s lawyers\n                    Loo Partners sent an email to the SGX-ST attaching\n                    a letter from the CEO. This email was copied to the\n                    applicant and the CFO. The CEO requested an appointment to\n                    meet the SGX-ST officers in the letter, and added the\n                    following: 5.    Furthermore, your request has raised some\n                            concerns.

We trust\n                            that you would agree such an impression is both\n                            inaccurate and unhealthy for the Company’s\n                            well being. 42     On 1 July 2011 China Sky issued an announcement\n                    to the effect that the land acquisition agreement, the\n                    subject of the SGX-ST’s Land Discrepancy queries,\n                    had been rescinded and RMB 263 million would be\n                    repaid. It is noteworthy that the amount of RMB 263million\n                    matches the total of the RMB 149 million land cost\n                    and RMB 114 million construction cost previously\n                    announced. 43     Further attempts were made to arrange meetings with the\n                    SGX-ST officers. On 11 August 2011 the SGX sent an\n                    email at 3.05 pm to the CFO, copied to management and all\n                    the Audit Committee members, statinginter alia: ... the Company has not cooperated with us and has\n                        refused to provide us with the documents to substantiate\n                        the Company’s representations in responses to\n                        the Exchange’s queries. Therefore we are of\n                        the view that unless the Company is able to show that it\n                        is willing to comply with our rules and requests, it\n                        will not be fruitful to have further meetings on these\n                        same points repeatedly.

There has been more than\n                        sufficient time for the Company to appoint the special\n                        auditors. We therefore require the Company to formally appoint\n                        the special auditors in compliance with the Directive by\n                        8 December 2011. No extension of time will be\n                        granted. If the Company fails to appoint the special auditors\n                        by 8 December 2011, it will be in breach of the\n                        Directive. We will not hesitate to take to further\n                        action against the Company. 60     On 8 December 2011, Asia Ascent emailed SGX-ST,\n                    copied to all the Audit Committee members and the CFO,\n                    attaching Asia Ascent’s letter copied to clients.\n                    This letter stated “Accordingly, the Board\n                    instructs us to urge you to state categorically your basis\n                    for the issue of the Directive. Each Director of the Board\n                    is aware of his fiduciary duty to act in the best interests\n                    of the Company and intend to continue to act\n                    accordingly”. It asked SGX-ST to furnish the\n                    following: … a.    Confirmation that the Directive is limited to\n                                the matters raised in paragraphs 2 (1),\n                                (iii) and (vii) of the Show Cause Letter; b.    If so, whether and if so what portion of our\n                                clients’ response dated\n                                27th September 2011 in relation thereto\n                                justifies the issuance of the Directive; c.    Confirmation as to whether the Directive was\n                                issued in response to any fact, matter or\n                                complaint not contained in our\n                                clients’ response dated\n                                27th September 2011; and d.    Confirmation if you are disputing our\n                                clients’ rights to appoint us to\n                                advise them on the Directive. We await your response and trust that you would act\n                        expeditiously as the board would have to consider the\n                        timing of the lifting of the suspension once all\n                        material facts are made known to all the\n                        stakeholders. 61     On 12 December 2011, Asia Ascent forwarded by\n                    email to SGX-ST, a letter dated 9 December 2011\n                    signed by the CEO, “on behalf of the Board of\n                    China Sky”. This email was not copied to all the\n                    Audit Committee members and stated that: ...we [China Sky] would like to know the basis of\n                        relevance of your queries, demand for information and\n                        documents on these transactions, directive and\n                        appointment of a special auditor to investigate these\n                        transactions. … From the abovementioned incidents, it appears that the\n                        Company and the Board are being investigated by you for\n                        matters and the nature of such investigation is\n                        ambiguous to the Company. That being the case, the\n                        Company believes that you state the grounds of your\n                        investigation and the authority of your right to\n                        investigate. Please also state the basis, rationale,\n                        scope and extent of this investigation. It is important\n                        that the Company and the Board be properly, legally and\n                        professionally guided and advised if indeed, an\n                        investigation is underway. The Company reiterates that it has no intention to\n                        conceal any material information from or mislead the\n                        investing public. It is noteworthy that the queries\n                        raised by the SGX were based on the information\n                        published by the Company voluntarily, either in its\n                        annual reports and/or announcements. In addition, these\n                        transactions queried by you had been properly disclosed\n                        and approved (if applicable) by the Board; and the same\n                        had been disclosed, reviewed and audited by the\n                        Company’ auditors.” 62     The letter also confirmed that the SGX-ST’s\n                    response was to be sent to Asia Ascent and all contact and\n                    correspondence between SGX-ST and “the various\n                    individuals comprising the Board, the CFO and the Company\n                    Secretary should continue to be directed through\n                    [them]”. 63     Mr Er Kwong Wah affirmed in his affidavit, that\n                    this letter was based on an earlier draft which was\n                    circulated to the directors in or around mid-November 2011,\n                    on the applicant’s suggestion. It is not disputed\n                    by the applicant that the applicant as one of all the Audit\n                    Committee members received all the material SGX-ST emails.\n                    The applicant does not dispute that all the\n                    Company’s announcements and communications with\n                    the SGX-ST sent by the CEO by order of the Board had been\n                    seen and approved by all China Sky directors prior to their\n                    issue. 64     Asia Ascent sent SGX-ST a letter dated\n                    12 December 2011 referring to a telephone\n                    conversation between SGX-ST’s Mr Richard\n                    Teng and the CEO in which they observed that this telephone\n                    conversation was in “breach of the established\n                    protocol that all communication with our clients must be\n                    effected through our office”. There followed an\n                    account of what transpired in this telephone conversation,\n                    and a request that SGX-ST furnish “exact and\n                    specific details of documents and information”\n                    which had not been provided and the “nature and\n                    details of punishment” and to “state\n                    the precise provision of relevant law, including any\n                    provision of the Listing Manual in support\n                    thereof.”",
        "16 December 2011 SGX-ST Reprimand of all\n                directors of China Sky Board": "65     On 16 December 2011, SGX-ST issued and announced\n                    the Reprimand: Singapore Exchange reprimands China\n                            Sky Fibre Chemical Limited and the Directors of its\n                            Board 1.    Singapore Exchange Limited reprimands China Sky\n                            Fibre Limited (“the Company”)\n                            and the Directors of its Board for failing to comply\n                            with the Exchange’s directive\n                            (“the Directive”) pursuant to\n                            Listing Rule 704(14) to appoint a Special Auditor.\n                            The Company persistently failed to comply despite\n                            every opportunity offered to the Company and its\n                            Board. 2.    The Directive arose because the Exchange has\n                            concerns over various issues, chiefly, certain\n                            interested party transactions\n                            (“IPTs”) between the Company\n                            and its Audit Committee (“AC”)\n                            Chairman, Lai Seng Kwoon, the aborted acquisition\n                            and development of land in China and certain repairs\n                            and maintenance costs (collectively, the\n                            “Special Audit Issues”). The\n                            company made contradictory statements and\n                            disclosures which were not substantiated when\n                            queried by the Exchange. Coupled with the unusual\n                            nature of the transactions and having regard to all\n                            the circumstances, the Exchange considered the\n                            interest of the Company’s shareholders and\n                            the investing public would be best served with the\n                            appointment of a Special Auditor to investigate the\n                            Special Audit Issues. 3.    On 16 November 2011, pursuant to Listing\n                            Rule 704(14), the Exchange issued the\n                            Directive. The appointment and terms of reference\n                            for the Special Auditor were to be carried out in\n                            consultation with the Exchange. As is the practice,\n                            the Special Auditor was to report to the independent\n                            members of the Audit Committee and the\n                            Exchange. 4.    On 17 November 2011, the Board of\n                            Directors (the “Board”)\n                            requested a trading suspension of the\n                            Company’s shares on its own accord and\n                            announced the Directive. It further stated that the\n                            Board would be meeting on an urgent basis to\n                            consider the Directive and “to make the\n                            necessary announcements as\n                            needed.” 5.    On 22 November 2011, the Board announced\n                            that it would “be seeking legal and\n                            professional advice to respond to this directive\n                            from SGX. The Board’s primary\n                            responsibility is to protect and preserve the value\n                            of all stakeholders. It will work expeditiously to\n                            resume trading of its shares upon receipt of\n                            appropriate legal and professional advice.\n                            Appropriate announcements will be made as and when\n                            they are available.” ON the same day, the\n                            Exchange asked the Board to provide timelines for\n                            its appointment of its legal and professional\n                            advisors and for the appointment of a Special\n                            Auditor. On 30 November 2011, the Company\n                            announced its appointment of a legal advisor but did\n                            not inform the Exchange nor disclose when it would\n                            comply with the appointment of the Special\n                            Auditor. 6.    The Company failed to appoint a Special Auditor\n                            even though sufficient time was accorded. This was\n                            despite the Board’s representation that it\n                            will work expeditiously to comply with the\n                            Directive. Further delay was unacceptable. On\n                            6 December 2011, the Exchange gave a\n                            deadline of 8 December 2011 for the Company\n                            to comply with the Directive. The Company failed to\n                            do so. Instead the Company wrote three letters to\n                            the Exchange. The letters made clear that the\n                            Company continued to refuse to comply with the\n                            directive for the appointment of the Special\n                            Auditor. 7.    The Exchange takes a serious view of the\n                            Board’s disregard of the Directive. The\n                            Exchange had given the Board numerous opportunities\n                            to respond to the Special Audit Issues and had\n                            carefully considered the responses. The Directive is\n                            made in the interest of the shareholders, and is\n                            taken only after careful and deliberate\n                            consideration. The Special Audit Report will provide\n                            clarity on the matters to be investigated. The\n                            Exchange’s concern is heightened when the\n                            Company not only failed to appoint the Special\n                            Auditor but instead aggressively resisted the\n                            Directive. 8.    The Exchange reiterates that it will continue to\n                            communicate directly with any officer of any listed\n                            company. The Exchange will not allow any issuer to\n                            dictate how it regulates listed companies. 9.    The Exchange reprimands the Company, and each and\n                            every one of the Board, namely Cheung Wing Lin,\n                            Huang Zhong Xuan, Song Jian Sheng, Wang Zhi Wei, Lai\n                            Seng Kwoon, Er Kwong Wah and Yeap Wai Kong for their\n                            flagrant disregard of the Directive and for their\n                            non-compliance with the Directive in breach of\n                            Listing Rule 704(14). 10.    It is in the interest of the Company and its\n                            shareholders for the Special Audit to be carried out\n                            immediately and the trading suspension lifted. The\n                            continued suspension of trading in the\n                            Company’s shares is not in the interest of\n                            shareholders. The Annexure to the Reprimand set out in extensive detail,\n                    particulars of the discrepancies and omissions of material\n                    disclosure of the IPT and Land Discrepancies, previously set\n                    out in the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter of\n                    23 August 2011, which warranted an independent\n                    review and report by a Special Auditor.",

The\n                            Reprimand was unwarranted, issued without any merit\n                            and clearly showed a total disregard of the interest\n                            of the shareholders and the circumstances leading to\n                            and surround our response to the SGX’s\n                            directive dated 16 November 2011\n                            (“SA Directive”) ... 5.    At a shareholders meeting held on\n                            November 30, 2011, in discussing the SA\n                            Directive, shareholders present had encouraged the\n                            Board to seek clarification from the SGX before\n                            appointing the Special Auditor as they noted that\n                            such an appointment would not be in their best\n                            interest in that, among other things, the\n                            appointment will cause the Company to incur\n                            substantial costs, will cause unnecessary\n                            disruptions to the Company’s business and\n                            operations, will distract the management’s\n                            attention when they ought to focus on the\n                            Company’s businesses under the prevailing\n                            adverse economic condition and will interfere with\n                            the annual audit process. ... 9.    The Company would be issuing another announcement\n                            on the points raised in the Annexure of the\n                            Reprimand. It will continue to attempt to work with\n                            the SGX and to address any legitimate concerns which\n                            the SGX may have. The Directors shall continue to\n                            act in the best interest of the company and without\n                            fear or favour and shall not yield to any pressure\n                            from any person if in doing so would not be in the\n                            best interest of the Company. The Company will\n                            continue to apprise the shareholders, as and when\n                            they become available. 68     On 22 December 2011 the CEO by order of the Board\n                    issued a response to the SGX-ST Reprimand Annexure. In\n                    short, its position was that with respect to the IPT and\n                    Land Discrepancies, adequate disclosure had been made\n                    following the announced responses to SGX’s\n                    queries. Further: 18.    The Company notes that whilst the SGX has regarded\n                            the transactions described in the Annexure as\n                            unusual, there have been no express allegations of\n                            accounting irregularities or fraudulent practices.\n                            In short, the usual reasons giving rise to concerns\n                            necessitating the appointment of Special Auditors\n                            for companies listed on the SGX are clearly absent.\n                            Accordingly we maintain that an appointment of\n                            Special Auditors would be unwarranted and clearly\n                            not in the best interest of the Company and its\n                            shareholders. ... 20.    In light of our response to the Reprimand as set\n                            out herein, we urge the SGX to justify the issuance\n                            of the SA Directive requiring an appointment of\n                            Special Auditors to be made by the Company as the\n                            proposed course would clearly be inconsistent with\n                            the best interest of the Company and its\n                            shareholders. 69     On 22 December 2011, Mr Er Kwong Wah\n                    issued an announcement in which he explained that he had\n                    been travelling and had not seen or approved the\n                    Company’s announcements of 21 and\n                    22 December 2011. He announced that “in\n                    practice all announcements from the company, particularly\n                    the ones concerning the Reprimand, Special Audit Directive\n                    and SGX Regulatory Actions must be approved by all Directors\n                    before issue”. Later the same day, the applicant\n                    issued an announcement: I note with concerns the recent unfortunate\n                        developments between the Company and the SGX. I have and\n                        will continue to encourage the Board to work closely\n                        with the SGX, in particular, to comply with the Listing\n                        Rules in the best interest of the Company and its\n                        stakeholders. Given that the common goal of the Company and the SGX\n                        is to act in the best interest of the shareholders, I\n                        shall continue with my efforts to facilitate such\n                        compliance with the Listing Rules and work towards the\n                        best interest of the Company and its\n                        stakeholders. 70     Mr Lai Seng Kwoon issued a same day announcement: I align with Mr Yeap Wai Kong and adopt the contents\n                        of his statement. I also record the continuing position\n                        of the directors to work in the best interest of the\n                        Company and the stakeholders. 71     On 29 December 2011 the SGX-ST sent an email,\n                    copied to the CEO and all the Audit Committee members,\n                    attaching a letter addressed to the Board of Directors and\n                    also “Attention-ed” to every director\n                    by name and position, which the CEO announced the following\n                    day. It stated: 3.    The scope of the Special Audit has been clearly\n                            set out in the Directive. There is no basis for the\n                            Company to use these two belated requests for\n                            clarification as an excuse for its continued failure\n                            to comply with the Directive. ... 4.    The exchange has consulted the Monetary Authority\n                            of Singapore. The Exchange hereby orders the Company\n                            to cease all non-compliance by 5 January\n                            2012 and appoint a Special Auditor, acceptable to\n                            the Exchange, on an immediate basis and without\n                            further delay. The date of 5 January 2012\n                            is final. 72     On 5 January 2012, there was no announcement by\n                    China Sky of the appointment of any Special Auditor. The\n                    same day, the applicant and the two other Audit Committee\n                    members announced their immediate resignations from the\n                    board of China Sky. 73     The applicant wrote a letter of complaint on\n                    9 January 2012 to the Chairman and CEO of the\n                    SGX-ST copied to the Chairman and CEO of the MAS setting out\n                    his complaint and requested an apology for the reprimand. He\n                    received an interim and then a fuller reply from the SGX-ST\n                    which did not accede to his request for an apology. In\n                    February 2012 the applicant sought leave under\n                    O 53 ROC for a quashing order to quash the SGX-ST\n                    Reprimand on grounds of a breach of natural justice and was\n                    granted leave for this hearing.",
        "5.   Was the applicant accorded a fair hearing\n                prior to the SGX Reprimand?": "74     The issue turns on whether the applicant was given notice\n                    that the SGX-ST was intending to reprimand him, the case\n                    against him and whether he was accorded an opportunity to\n                    make representations. 75     From 16 May 2011 to 23 August 2011, the\n                    SGX-ST sent repeated emails to China Sky’s CFO,\n                    all copied to the applicant as an Audit Committee member,\n                    raising queries on the IPT and Land Discrepancies\n                    announcements which only raised further questions. For\n                    3 months, the directors approved the\n                    Company’s announcements containing corrections of\n                    earlier announcements which raised more queries. The failure\n                    to make the required disclosures resulted in the SGX-ST\n                    Board Show Cause Letter of 23 August 2011 which was\n                    addressed to the Board of Directors, emailed to the\n                    applicant and received by all the directors. The letter\n                    which was entitled “CHINA SKY CHEMICAL FIBRE CO.\n                    LTD (THE “COMPANY”) LISTING RULE\n                    BREACHES, meticulously pinpointed the particular Company\n                    announcements and set out the non-disclosures and misleading\n                    disclosures against the specific Listing Manual Rules that\n                    had been breached and concluded: In view of the foregoing, the Exchange intends to\n                        issue a public reprimand and reserves the right to take\n                        any further action as necessary. Please show cause why relevant disciplinary actions\n                        should not be taken against the Company for the above\n                        breaches. Please respond to this letter by\n                        30 August 2011.If we do not hear from you by\n                        the stipulated date, the Exchange will decide on the\n                        appropriate actions to take, without further reference\n                        to you. 76     It is clear from the foregoing that the applicant had been\n                    provided with full particulars of the breaches of the\n                    Listing Manual and with notice that SGX-ST intended to\n                    publicly reprimand and reserved the right to take further\n                    action. The applicant’s counsel submitted that as\n                    this letter was addressed to the Company, it was not\n                    addressed to the applicant as an individual director. It is\n                    beyond dispute that the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter,\n                    which is expressly addressed to the Board of Directors, is\n                    necessarily meant to and does include every director. It was\n                    received by every director. The submission in this factual\n                    context, that the show cause letter addressed to and\n                    received by the Board of Directors does not put the\n                    individual directors on notice of an intended reprimand and\n                    the case against each of them carries no weight. It is\n                    further on record that the Board of Directors took legal\n                    advice on this letter (see[44]above). 77     It is clear from para 3 of the SGX-ST Board Show\n                    Cause Letter that the SGX-ST intended to issue a public\n                    reprimand. The only relevant provision of the Listing Manual\n                    relating to a public reprimand is Rule 720 and\n                    relates only to directors of listed companies, and not the\n                    companies themselves. In short, all the directors were given\n                    unequivocal notice that SGX-ST intended to publicly\n                    reprimand them. They were all also given full particulars of\n                    the case against them. They were given opportunity to\n                    provide documents required under the Documents Directive of\n                    6 November 2011 and finally to appoint a special\n                    auditor to review and report on the same continuing\n                    non-disclosures by the Special Auditor Directive of\n                    16 November 2011. The SGX-ST Reprimand of\n                    16 December 2011 came only after a lapse of six\n                    months of continuing non-disclosures, non-compliance with\n                    consequential Directives and directors’ approved\n                    Company announcements signifying a refusal to make or\n                    procure accurate material disclosures as repeatedly\n                    requested by SGX-ST. 78     During these six months, the Board of Directors, the CEO\n                    and CFO and all the Audit Committee members, including the\n                    applicant, were in direct communication with the SGX-ST on\n                    these matters and had full opportunity to explain or make\n                    representations, if they so wished. Quite apart from China\n                    Sky’s original lawyers, the Company had appointed\n                    Asia Ascent to advise them on the Special Auditor Directive.\n                    The Company’s letter to the SGX-ST on\n                    24 August 2011 in response to the SGX-ST Board Show\n                    Cause Letter expressly invoked their rights to\n                    “natural justice and due process” (see[44]above). If any\n                    individual director wished to put his personal\n                    representation upon receipt of the SGX-ST Board Show Cause\n                    Letter of 23 August 2011, which was at variance\n                    with their subsequent directors’ approved Company\n                    announcements and communications to SGX-ST, he had full\n                    opportunity to do so. There is nothing on record to show\n                    that any of the directors saw any need to procure the\n                    announcement of the material information set out in\n                    SGX-ST’s Board Show Cause Letter, nor comply with\n                    the subsequent Directives whose objectives were to provide\n                    independent verification of the same material information.\n                    Instead, during this period, the directors approved China\n                    Sky announcements and communications, whichex facierepeatedly and\n                    unequivocally refused to do so. 79     Since an orderly transparent securities market is\n                    contingent on the timely and accurate disclosure of material\n                    corporate information, the lapse of time from May 2011 to\n                    December 2011 during which no disclosure was made as\n                    requested by the SGX-ST, despite the full knowledge and\n                    approval of all the directors, is troubling. The Document\n                    Directive, and later the Special Auditor Directive were both\n                    the consequence of the continuing failure to provide\n                    accurate material disclosure of the IPT and Land\n                    Discrepancies raised by the China Sky AR 2010. 80     The applicant next argues that he personally had not been\n                    accorded a fair hearing on two grounds. Firstly that the\n                    original show cause letter of 23 August 2011 was\n                    addressed only to the Board of Directors. The succeeding\n                    Document Directive of 2 November 2011 was similarly\n                    addressed to the Board of Directors. The Special Auditor\n                    Directive of 16 November 2011 was addressed to the\n                    Board of Directives and additionally\n                    “Attention-ed” to the individually\n                    named directors but inexplicably omitted the applicant by\n                    name. The applicant was a recipient of all these operative\n                    SGX-ST emails letters and Directives. Nothing turns on the\n                    omission of his name from the Special Auditor Directive. The\n                    applicant cannot deny that the SGX-ST Board Show Cause\n                    Letter and the Directives were addressed to the Board of\n                    Directors of which he is a member or that they put him on\n                    notice of their contents. The applicant’s final\n                    argument that SGX-ST ought to have issued him additionally\n                    with a personal show cause letter is without merit as he had\n                    received the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter and Directives,\n                    all of which were all addressed to and received by him as a\n                    board member. 81     The applicant is aggrieved that he was reprimanded by the\n                    SGX-ST. He joined the China Sky board and Audit Committee\n                    shortly after the SGX-ST queried China Sky’s AR\n                    2010. He actively engaged in attempting to arrange for the\n                    CEO and CFO to meet the SGX-ST officers to resolve the\n                    problems. Even after the Special Auditor Directive he is\n                    recorded in the minutes of the board meeting of\n                    19 November 2011 of having urged the company to\n                    comply with the Special Auditor Directive. His well-meaning\n                    efforts at urging compliance and arranging meetings appear\n                    to have distracted him from fully appreciating the\n                    significance of the SGX-ST Board Show Cause Letter and the\n                    subsequent Directives.",
        "6.   Conclusion": "82     The SGX-ST fully and substantively accorded the applicant\n                    a fair hearing by having given him notice of its intention\n                    to reprimand, particulars of the case against him and full\n                    opportunities between August to December 2011 to be\n                    heard. 83     Application dismissed."
