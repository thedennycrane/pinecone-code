        "The decision of the court": "Section 17(1)(a) and (c) Debtors Act, on which the defendants had relied for the AO, read:17(1) If it is shown to the satisfaction of the court or a judge, at any time after the issue of a writ of summons, by evidence on oath, that the plaintiff has a good cause of action against the defendant, and -(a) that the defendant is absent from Singapore and that his place of abode cannot be discovered;(b) ...; or(c) that the defendant, with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any judgment which has been or may be made against him, has removed, or is about to remove, or has concealed, or is concealing, or making away with, or handing over to others, any of his movable or immovable property,the court or judge may order that the property of the defendant, or any part thereof, be forthwith seized by the Sheriff of the Supreme Court as a pledge or surety to answer the just demand of the plaintiff, until the trial of the action and satisfaction of any judgment that may be made against the defendant; but such order shall not constitute the plaintiff a secured creditor if the defendant is adjudicated bankrupt:Provided ...The proviso is not relevant to these proceedings.Order 74 rr 5 to 11 of the Rules of Court govern the procedural matters pertaining to an application under the above section. In particular, r 8 provides that seizure shall be effected in the same manner as under a WSS.The plaintiffs cited various authorities for the proposition that the jurisdiction to grant an AO is extraordinary in nature and must therefore be sparingly exercised. This is because the restraint on the use of property would be before the respective rights of the parties are determined (see for instanceKanshi Ram v Hindustan National Bank Ltd[1928]  AIR 376;Nanyang Development (1966) Sdn Bhd v Malaysian Armed Forces Cooperative Housing Society Ltd[1972] 2 MLJ 149). To this extent, the jurisdiction under the Debtors Act is akin to the general jurisdiction of the courts to grant injunctions and the principle of full and frank disclosure applies with equal force to both. It is of course axiomatic that the applicant for an AO must also satisfy the relevant conditions spelt out in the said s 17(1). The first prerequisite is that the applicant must have a good cause of action. He must then satisfy one or more of the disjunctive conditions stipulated in (a), (b) and (c).It was further submitted that the jurisdiction in respect of an AO should only be invoked when the court is satisfied that the debtors are about to dispose of their property with intent to obstruct or delay the execution of any judgment and that it is imperative that the element of intent be satisfied.In the High Court suit, the debtors had already conceded that they were indebted to the defendants here. In fact, within two weeks of the commencement of that action, judgment by admission was entered. There could therefore be no doubt that the defendants had a good cause of action against the debtors. In respect of s 17(1)(a), it was patent that the first and second debtors, the existing partners of the debtor firm, were not in Singapore at the time of the application and that, although they were said to have left for India, their place of abode could not be discovered. Suspecting or even knowing that the debtors were in any particular country does not detract from this fact. The fact that they are Singapore Citizens  and may or will return some day also does not change the position. Similarly, the fact that they have solicitors in Singapore offers cold comfort when the solicitors could not reach them for instructions. As for s 17(1)(c), paras 5 to 14 of Raj Kumar`s affidavit filed in support of the AO do support amply the allegation that the debtors had concealed and made away with the stock-in-trade. The requisite intention, in almost all cases, can only be inferred from the circumstances. The countermanding of the cheque, the third Debtor`s resumption of a similar business elsewhere in Singapore, his failure to inform the creditors earlier about his withdrawal from the debtor firm and his ability to gain access to the stock-in-trade in [num ]02-11 Satnam House were circumstances in which one could justifiably draw the inference that such an intention existed.At first, I was a little perturbed by para 13 of Raj Kumar`s said affidavit in that it appeared to suggest that the goods had been siphoned off to [num ]02-11 Satnam House when what was meant was that the goods could have been siphoned out from [num ]02-11. After considering the matter further, I was satisfied that para 13 had been drafted inelegantly rather than deceptively. The failure to disclose the fact that the creditors` committee had one set of keys and that they had placed a lock on [num ]02-11 did not materially affect the position as the creditors` committee did not have access to [num ]02-11 anyway and the third debtor had access to the back door of the premises, a fact the plaintiffs were unable to dispute. It also appeared that the third debtor could be contacted, at least by his solicitors, although his physical whereabouts might be unknown to the defendants then. However, this did not form the crux of the application for the AO.A recurring theme which emerged in the plaintiffs` submissions was that the defendants had supported the debtors in their application for an interim order under the Bankruptcy Act both before and one day after obtaining the AO and therefore could not have held the belief that caused them to apply for the AO and that the AO was nothing more than an attempt to steal a march on the plaintiffs or to prevent the plaintiffs from doing the same to the other creditors. I note that the debtors had not contested any of the matters alleged against them in the obtaining of the AO although the AO encompassed their personal property as well. It was not alleged that the defendants and the debtors were colluding in this matter. Although they had been generally cooperative with their creditors, it was not unreasonable for the defendants to have the fears stated in Raj Kumar`s affidavit supporting the AO in the light of the changing circumstances of the case. Despite all that the plaintiffs have argued about the debtors` noble intentions, their solicitors` letter dated 15 February 2000 to the Bailiff (quoted in para 27 above) betrayed their true feelings. Having obtained the protection of the AO, it was not inconsistent for the defendants to have supported the debtors` subsequent application for another interim order under the Bankruptcy Act if the terms proposed were acceptable to them.Considering all the circumstances of this case, I was of the view that the AO was properly obtained and that there was no material non-disclosure. The duty of disclosure here need not extend to disclosing each and every affidavit filed in related proceedings so long as the picture presented to the court is true and fair.The matter, however, does not rest there as s 20 Debtors Act provides:Any property so seized, or the proceeds of sale thereof, shall be liable to execution in satisfaction of any judgment in the action against the defendant; but it shall be subject to the prior claims of any judgment creditor whose judgment was obtained within one year before the seizure thereof under this Part if the judgment creditor had issued execution against the defendant`s property before the making of any order under this Part.Both ss 17 and 20 fall within Part III of the Debtors Act. It was obvious that the plaintiffs` judgment had been obtained within one year before the seizure by the defendants. Have they `issued execution` before the making of the AO?The defendants said, no, because inLloyds and Scottish Finance Ltd v Modern Cars and Caravans (Kingston) Ltd[1966] 1 QB 764[1964] 2 All ER 732, Edmund Davies J, in considering s 26(1) of the Sale of Goods Act 1893, made it clear that until either payment or sale, a WSS remained `unexecuted`. With respect, I fear that this submission was based on an erroneous reading of the case and counsel`s submissions therein have been taken as the learned judge`s finding. The proviso to the said s 26(1) states that no WSS shall prejudice the title to goods acquired by any person in good faith and for valuable consideration unless he had at the time when he acquired his title notice that such WSS had been delivered to and remained unexecuted in the hands of the Sheriff. Edmund Davies J said (at [1966] 1 QB 764, 781; [1964] 2 All ER 732, 740):... and where such an essential step in execution as actual seizure has already been effected, it is, I hold, impossible to regard the writ as one which still `remained unexecuted in the hands of the sheriff`.In any case, s 20 speaks of `issued execution` and not whether a WSS had been executed. Order 46 r 4(1) provides that `issue of a writ of execution takes place on its being sealed by an officer of the Registry`. Order 46 r 1 defines a writ of execution to include a WSS. Clearly, therefore, the plaintiffs had `issued execution` against the debtors` property when they took out their WSS. But did they do so `before the making of any order` under s 17?Order 42 r 7(1) states that a judgment or order of the court takes effect from the day of its date. If `before the making of any order` in the said s 20 means the plaintiffs` WSS must have been issued a day earlier, then the plaintiffs do not obtain priority over the defendants. If those words relate to the precise time of the day, in all probability the AO was made well before 10.32 am on 16 February 2000 (the earliest time the plaintiffs` WSS could have been sealed as stamping was required first). The fact that the AO was extracted well after 10.32am does not change the legal position that it had been made before the plaintiffs `issued execution`. I therefore hold that s 20 does not accord priority to the plaintiffs.The defendants also submitted that the plaintiffs had no locus standi to take out such an application to set aside the AO as the Debtors Act contemplated an application by the debtor only. In any case, they argued, O 74 r 11 provides that any claim by a third party to the property seized shall be dealt with in the manner relating to interpleader proceedings. I do not agree. In the unusual circumstances here, the plaintiffs obviously had a legitimate interest as competing creditors to protect. Further, O 74 r 11 only governs applications by the Sheriff who would  proceed by way of interpleader should he face conflicting claims. It does not deal with the manner in which the plaintiffs should seek to establish their claim.In respect of costs, whatever the circumstances leading to the withdrawal of the plaintiffs` application in Suit 600156/2000 may have been, the order dated 9 March 2000 is clear - it leaves me free to consider the appropriate amount of costs to award for this originating summons as well as the said earlier application. As I agreed with some and not all of the defendants` contentions, I decided that a fair amount of costs to be awarded for both matters would be $5,000.In the result, the originating summons was dismissed with costs fixed at $5,000 to be paid by the plaintiffs to the defendants.Outcome:Application dismissed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
