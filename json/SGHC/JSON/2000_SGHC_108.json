        "CONCLUSION ON SINTALOW’S CLAIMS AND\n\nRICWIL’S COUNTERCLAIMS": "75. The amounts which Ricwil must pay\n\nSintalow (both those conceded by Ricwil in negotiations and those found by me to be due)\n\nare:(i) per para 5 above, $322,256.55;(ii) per para 7 above, $2,483.31;(iii) per para 8 above, $3,373.50;(iv) per para 10 above, $17,865.35;(v) per para 23 above, $57,154.50;(vi) per para 29 above, $5,150.The total amount due from Ricwil to\n\nSintalow is therefore $408,283.21.76. The amounts which Sintalow must pay\n\nRicwil (both those conceded by Sintalow in negotiations and those found by me to be due)\n\nare:(i) per para 31 above, $129,725.50;(ii) per para 31, above, $4,683.93;(iii) per para 36 above, $45,829.89;(iv) per para 55 above, $74,205.70;(v) per para 73 above, $8,756.07.The total amount due from Sintalow to\n\nRicwil is therefore $263,201.09.77. When the two amounts are off set\n\nagainst each other, there remains a balance of $145,082.12 due to Sintalow from Ricwil. I\n\naward this sum to Sintalow. As for interest, I think it fair to award Sintalow interest\n\nfrom 1 July 1998 at 6% per annum. This is because the accounts between Ricwil and Sintalow\n\nceased to run around mid 1996 when Ricwil moved out of the Fan Yoong Road premises. Given\n\nthat the parties had a long relationship with many transactions between them and that the\n\nstate of the inter-company accounts and that of Ricwil’s internal accounts were not\n\nsatisfactory, a certain amount of time would have been required for the parties to work\n\nout exactly what each of them owed the other. If they had done this during the two years\n\nfollowing Ricwil’s removal, they would have sorted out the accounts by the end of\n\nJune 1998 and would have realised that there was an amount owing to Sintalow. It should\n\nhave then been paid promptly. Accordingly, in my judgment, Sintalow has been kept out of\n\nits money for an unnecessary protracted period and is entitled to some interest though not\n\nfrom the date of the writ.RICWIL’S CLAIMS AGAINST MR CHEW AND\n\nMADAM AW78. Ricwil’s claims against Mr Chew\n\nand Madam Aw are founded on the duties which they, as directors, owed Ricwil to:(a) act honestly and use diligence in the\n\n  exercise of their duties;(b) ensure they were not in a situation of\n\n  conflict of interest.Whilst there is no doubt that directors in\n\ngeneral owe such duties to their companies, whether the companies concerned can sue those\n\ndirectors for breach of duty depends not only on the breach having occurred but also on\n\nthe companies having sustained loss by reason of such breach. A breach of duty which does\n\nnot result in financial loss may justify the removal of the director from his post. It\n\ndoes not justify an action for damages against him.79. In its pleading, Ricwil specifies\n\nvarious instances in which it is alleged that the actions of Mr Chew and his wife, in\n\nbreach of their duties as directors, caused loss to the company. Those instances\n\noverlapped with claims which Ricwil has made against Sintalow. Insofar as Ricwil has\n\nsuccessfully asserted such claims against Sintalow, it cannot contend that the actions of\n\nMr Chew and/or Madam Aw caused it loss because those claims would have to be paid by\n\nSintalow either directly or by way of set off against the amounts which Ricwil itself has\n\nbeen found to owe Sintalow. Insofar as Ricwil has been unsuccessful in asserting those\n\nclaims, the consequence is that payments have been properly made to Sintalow pursuant to a\n\nlegal obligation on the part of Ricwil and therefore Ricwil has nothing to complain about\n\nin relation to the conduct of its directors with regard to those claims.80. The best way of dealing with the\n\nclaims that Ricwil has made against its former directors would be to consider each in turn\n\nand first establish whether the actions complained of have resulted in loss to the company\n\nand if they have, whether those actions can be classified as having been in breach of\n\nduty. In this respect, it should be remembered that Madam Aw was not a director of Ricwil\n\nfor very long. Any liability that she has is not coextensive with any liability that might\n\nbe established on the part of Mr Chew. Madam Aw’s liability has to be considered\n\nseparately in the context of the time period during which she served as a director.81. Paragraph 15 of the amended\n\ncounterclaim by Ricwil contains an averment that Mr Chew and/or Madam Aw on behalf of\n\nSintalow caused Ricwil to make payment to Sintalow by way of set off of the running\n\naccount between Sintalow and Ricwil for various items which Ricwil was not actually\n\nobliged to pay for. There are 12 sub-paragraphs to paragraph 15 each detailing a different\n\ndebit. Some of these were settled in negotiations. I will deal only with those that\n\nremained part of Ricwil’s counterclaim against Sintalow during the trial.82. Paragraph 15.9 of the counterclaim\n\ndeals with the debit note no. 001AA/01/92 from Sintalow to Ricwil for the sum of\n\n$80,429.95 being the audit adjustment to regularise the discrepancy between the opening\n\naccounts of Sintalow and those of Ricwil for 1992. I have considered that debit note above\n\nand have found that it was properly issued. Accordingly, Ricwil cannot complain of any\n\nloss by reason of its issue.83. Paragraph 15.10 of the counterclaim\n\ndeals with the payments made to Airmaid. I have found that Airmaid was overpaid to the\n\nextent of $74,205.70. This was a result of Mr Chew’s carelessness in not checking\n\nthat payments were actually due before authorising payment and also as a result of\n\nSintalow wrongly debiting Ricwil’s account for amounts which Sintalow itself had owed\n\nAirmaid. I have already found that Sintalow must repay the full amount to Ricwil. The same\n\nhas been set off against Ricwil’s indebtedness to Sintalow. So Mr Chew’s actions\n\nhave not resulted in any loss to Ricwil.84. Paragraph 15.11 of the counterclaim\n\ndeals with the pipes delivered to 8M M&E Services while paragraph 15.12 deals with the\n\npayments made for the pipes purchased from Falcon. In both these cases, I have found that\n\nSintalow billed Ricwil correctly. There is no cause of action against Mr Chew who was a\n\ndirector at the material time.85. Paragraph 16 of the counterclaim avers\n\nthat Madam Aw caused Ricwil to make payment to HSH and Sintalow for pipes which Ricwil\n\nnever obtained the benefit of. Ricwil subsequently abandoned half of this claim and in\n\nrespect of the remaining $8,756.09 which it pursued, I have found in its favour. This\n\namount has been paid by Sintalow by way of the set off in para 77 and therefore Ricwil has\n\nsuffered no loss.86. Paragraphs 23 and 24 of the\n\ncounterclaim aver that Mr Chew and/or Madam Aw, have in breach of their duties to Ricwil\n\nand without disclosing the full facts to Ricwil, caused Ricwil to pay Sintalow\n\nadministrative and service charges which had been unilaterally imposed on Ricwil by\n\nSintalow. Given Ricwil’s concession during the course of the trial that it was liable\n\nto pay a reasonable amount to Sintalow for both the administrative and service charges,\n\nand given that I have found the amounts actually charged to be reasonable, Ricwil has not\n\nsuffered any loss from the alleged breaches of duty.87. In the result, I hold that Ricwil has\n\nnot established that it has suffered any loss from any of the breaches of duty which it\n\nhas alleged that Mr Chew and Madam Aw committed. Its claim against them must be dismissed.CONCLUSION88. There will be judgment for Sintalow in\n\nthe sum of $145,082.12 and interest according to para 77. Ricwil’s claim against\n\nMadam Aw and Mr Chew is dismissed. I will hear the parties on costs as the various claims\n\nand counterclaims were intertwined and whilst overall Sintalow has succeeded, it has\n\nfailed on some issues and therefore perhaps some adjustment should be made in relation to\n\ncosts.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
