        "As regards Daewoo (Korea)": "`On or about end 1997, the defendants were severely affected by the Asian financial crisis (`crisis`), which resulted in a sharp devaluation of the Korean Won against the United States Dollar. Such crisis was completely impossible to predict and outside the contemplation of the plaintiffs and the defendants at the time of the signing of the facility and the guarantee and hence created an event of frustration preventing the defendants from complying with their obligations under the facility and/or the guarantee.Clause 1 of the guarantee provides that Daewoo (Korea) will pay OCBC on demand `all sums of moneys or liabilities which are now or shall hereafter from time to time be due or owing or shall remain unpaid to [OCBC]`. The obligation is in fact expressed much more comprehensively but this is sufficient for the present purpose. It is not disputed that it covers the claim now made against Daewoo (Korea).Counsel has not pointed to any provisions of the guarantee relevant to the guarantor`s liability in the event of the `sharp devaluation of the Korean Won against the Unite States Dollar` alleged but cl 27 provides:[Daewoo (Korea)`s] payment obligation hereunder shall be in the currency in which the aforesaid facilities are accorded or granted by [OCBC] to [Daewoo (Singapore)] (`stipulated currency`) and shall not be discharged by an amount paid in a currency other than the stipulated currency whether pursuant to a judgment or otherwise to the extent that the amount so paid on prompt conversion to the stipulated currency under normal banking procedures does not yield the amount in the stipulated currency.The stipulated currency is US Dollar. Daewoo (Korea) may pay in some other currency but the liability is only discharged to the extent of the amount in the stipulated currency on conversion. Any `loss` arising out of the conversion is to be borne by the guarantor and such `loss` will depend on the exchange rate and the exchange rate will vary from time to time. If there is a gain on conversion the benefit belongs exclusively to Daewoo (Korea).Counsel has not demonstrated that the situation created by the sharp devaluation of the Korean Won is fundamentally different from that when the guarantee was given. As provided for in cl 27 the parties clearly contemplated changes in the exchange rate and all that has emerged as alleged by Daewoo (Korea) is the sharp devaluation. Changes in the exchange rate can be and are expected and the parties to a loan transaction and guarantee such as the bank, the borrower and the guarantor in this case enter into the transaction on the basis that they accept the risks associated with such changes.In my judgment on the materials before the court the alleged sharp devaluation of the Korean Won against the US Dollar has not brought about a situation that is fundamentally different from that in which the guarantee was given. Nothing in the terms of the guarantee or of the underlying loan shows that the bank and the guarantor never agreed to be bound in the event of such devaluation as alleged or in the event of any fluctuation in the rate of exchange between the stipulated currency (US Dollar) and any other currency.`Further and/or in the alternative by reason of the government of the Republic of Korea`s policy guidelines and/or directives to Korean Chaebols including [Daewoo (Korea)] to reduce debt equity ratios from over 500% to 200% by the end of 1999 [Daewoo (Korea)] [was] faced with short term liquidity problems. `Mr Lee Young Kwon the administration manager of Daewoo (Singapore) produced a copy of the government of Korea`s press release together with an English translation. The statement sets out among other things the `need to restructure five chaebol groups` and the `principles to apply`. One of these principles is the `faithful performance of five primary objectives` and one of these objectives is `financial structure improvement` by:Inducing new money through sales of non-core businesses or issue of new shares focusing upon viable corporations within a chaebol in order to improve the financial structure.Through achieving the above, the average debt ratio to be improved down to the international level (200%) by the end of the year 1999.The statement does not evidence any guideline or directive to Daewoo (Korea) to reduce the debt to equity ratio to 200% as alleged. Reduction of the debt to equity ratio is a consequence (desirable and much hoped for no doubt) of carrying out a number of measures including sale of non-core businesses and raising new equity capital. The debt to equity ratio is also reduced by paying offthe debts or a combination ofthese measures.There is no evidence that Daewoo (Korea) has attempted any of the measures. The statement was issued in 1998 and when the loan was granted and the guarantee given the situation created by the terms of the statement would already have been in place. There has been no change in the situation. The situation at the time when Daewoo (Korea) was called upon to pay under the guarantee was no different from that when the guarantee was given and it is no different today.`On or about 25 June 1998, 210 Korean financial institutions entered into a Corporate Restructuring Accord (`the Accord`) to provide a framework for an out of court rehabilitationof companies in the Republic of Korea with financial difficulties. ``On or about 26 August 1999, [Daewoo (Korea)] [was] placed under a corporate workout programme pursuant to the Accord. ``By reason of the corporate workout programme pursuant to the Accord and with a view to complying with the government of the Republic of Korea`s policy guidelines and/or directives to reduce debt equity ratios to 200% by the end of 1999, [Daewoo (Korea)] [is] unable to pay [OCBC] for the entire period in which [Daewoo (Korea)] [is] under a corporate workout programme, such payment being impossible and/or contradictory to the terms and spirit of the corporate workout programme and the policy guidelines and/or directives given by the government of the Republic of Korea. `Mr Kweon Soon Wook, themanager of the finance department of Daewoo (Singapore), produced a copy of the Accord together with an English translation. It appears to be an agreement entered into by financial institutions. Article 1 provides that the purpose of the agreement is `to promote the soundness of the assets of the  financial institutions by devising the improvement of corporate restructuring of lending institutions` and art 2 defines `corporate restructuring` as the `process by which to make sound the financial structure of the relevant company`. A `relevant company` is a debtor of a financial institution which it wishes to `engage in restructuring` under the terms of the agreement. I think `corporate restructuring of lending institutions` in art 1 refers to corporate restructuring of relevant companies by creditor financial institutions.Daewoo (Korea)`s allegation is that on or about 26 August 1999 it was `placed under a corporate workout programme pursuant to the Accord`. Mr Kweon said in his affidavit that `in order to prevent a total collapse of the Daewoo Group a decision was made to enter into the workout programme`. Having regard to the terms of the Accord I think what is really alleged is that Daewoo (Korea) was `engaged` by its creditor financial institution in restructuring under the terms of the Accord. Daewoo (Korea) is required by its creditor financial institution to undertake `corporate restructuring`.There is no evidence of any process of `corporate restructuring` that Daewoo (Korea) was `engaged` by its creditor financial institution to undertake or has undertaken and it is impossible to say that a fundamentally different situation has now unexpectedly emerged. The Accord was entered into in June 1998 and although Daewoo (Korea) was `engaged` in August 1999 it cannot be said that the situation whether different or not had emergedunexpectedly. It was a risk which Daewoo (Korea) must have expected since the Accord was entered into.When the guarantee was given by Daewoo (Korea) the terms of the statement in the press release of the government of Korea were already in place. The Accord had already been entered into. I have considered the terms of the guarantee and the underlying loan and the circumstances prevailing when these transactions were entered into. Counsel has not shown how it can be said that on the true construction of the contractual arrangements between the parties they do not apply in the situation prevailing at the time when the guarantee was called upon or at any subsequent time. I am unable to see that any situation has emerged that is fundamentally different or that the parties never agreed to be bound in any such situation.",
        "As regards Daewoo (Singapore)": "`[Daewoo (Singapore] would further aver that at all material times it is a solvent company and a wholly owned subsidiary of [Daewoo (Korea)] and wholly dependent on [Daewoo (Korea)] for funds for its operations. ``[Dawoo (Korea)] currently [holds] funds due to [Daewoo (Singapore)] and by reason of the above matters, [Daewoo (Korea)] [is]unable to effect payment to [Daewoo (Singapore)]and consequently [Daewoo (Singapore)] [is] discharged from further performance of the facility for the duration in which [Daewoo (Korea)] [is] involved in the said corporate workout programme. `The case as pleaded as far as I can make out comes to this. Daewoo (Singapore) is entirely dependent on Daewoo (Korea) for funds. Daewoo (Korea) holds funds which are due to Daewoo (Singapore) and since Daewoo (Korea)  cannot pay Daewoo (Singapore) because it is involved in the `corporate workout programme`, Daewoo (Singapore) is discharged from liability to repay money it has borrowed from OCBC. I should be surprised indeed if this is the law but counsel has not come up with any authorities to support it and I am content to say that this raises no reasonable or probable ground of defence. The evidence however is not that Daewoo (Korea) holds funds due to Daewoo (Singapore). Mr Kweon said that the US$7m was lent by Daewoo (Singapore) to Daewoo (Korea). This adds nothing to the defence. In any case there is no evidence that Daewoo (Korea) cannot pay to its wholly owned subsidiary money which is due to it.Finally it is alleged that the defendants are discharged `by reason of impossibility of performance and/or frustration in that any payment of any sum to the plaintiffs, whether principal or interest, while the defendants are under the or subject to the regime of the corporate workout programme pursuant to the Accord, would amount to undue preference in favour of the plaintiffs over other creditors`. The only evidence of this `undue preference` is Mr Kweon`s statement in his affidavit. He said:`With [Daewoo (Korea)] participating in the Accord, [Daewoo (Korea)] [was] unable to repay the same pursuant to the said corporate workout programme. This would be considered an `undue preference` to [Daewoo (Singapore)] and/or [OCBC] as all creditors of [Daewoo (Korea)] should receive similar treatment. `The Accord contains no such provision.Counsel was not able to assist as regards the `undue preference` alleged. Daewoo (Singapore) is a company incorporated in Singapore and carries on business in Singapore. Daewoo (Korea) is a corporation that is registered as a foreign company in Singapore and has a place of business or carries on business in Singapore. Neither of them is in liquidation in Singapore and there is no likelihood of their being in liquidation which will be deemed to have commenced at any time before down to the date of hearing of this appeal. There is no evidence as regards any foreign law that may be relevant and touching upon `undue preference`.There is no issue or question in dispute that ought to be tried and there is no other reason for a trial of the claim or any part of it. There will be judgment for the bank as claimed.Outcome:Appealallowed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
