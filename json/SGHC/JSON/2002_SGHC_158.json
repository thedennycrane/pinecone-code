        "The appeal": "12 The main issue to be decided in the present case was whether,\n\nassuming that the evidence adduced by the prosecution above was true and that there was\n\nnothing to displace reasonable inferences that could be drawn from the above primary\n\nfacts, the prosecution had established a case against the accused which, if unrebutted,\n\nwould warrant his conviction under s 22(1)(a) of the Act.13 There are certain aspects of the magistrate’s reasoning with\n\nwhich I did not entirely concur. In the court below, the magistrate drew a distinction\n\nbetween \"found armed\" and \"armed with\" and this can be seen from the\n\nfollowing paragraphs of his grounds of decision:10. To compound matters further, the opening limb of\n\n    section 22(1) also requires that the accused be \"found armed\" with the dangerous\n\n    weapon. In addition, in order for the prosecution to rely on the presumption under section\n\n    22(2), the prosecution must \"allege and prove that the accused was found to be armed\n\n    with any dangerous or offensive instrument\".…14. …The next issue then was whether from the existing evidence\n\n    adduced by the prosecution, mainly the act of seeing the screwdriver sliding down from the\n\n    accused’s trousers and the accused’s action in shaking it off from his trousers,\n\n    the necessary inferences could be drawn to show that the accused was \"found\n\n    armed\" with the screwdriver at the material time as required by the provision, and\n\n    not merely \"armed with\" or \"in possession of\" the screwdriver.14 The court below referred to the Canadian case ofR v Mitchell and\n\nMaclean[1932] 1 W.W.R 657, in which the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal construed the\n\nword \"found\" in s 464(a) of the Canadian Criminal Code:By virtue of its presence and relationship, we think thatthe\n\n    word \"found\" in sec 464 carries with it the implication that the person in\n\n    possession of the instrument must be discovered with it in such a place as to afford\n\n    ground for a reasonable opportunity to use it in the commission of a criminal offence.\n\n    Thus the place, as well as the time of discovery, must tend to incriminate him.It\n\n    is not enough that he may have a housebreaking instrument in those ordinary lawful haunts,\n\n    such as home or office, where a man may keep such a thing without arousing suspicion of\n\n    its use for a criminal purpose, other than such as may arise from its own unlawful\n\n    character. To put it briefly, he must be discovered with it abroad. (Emphasis added)15 It seems to me that the magistrate was rather influenced by the\n\nabove passage fromMitchelland this can be seen from his decision:15. …The arresting officers had…received a message that\n\n    either a group of foreigners (per Sgt Ahmad) or Indians (per Cpl Ang) was fighting at\n\n    Dunlop Street. Upon arrival at the scene, the officers saw a group of Indians dispersing.\n\n    They then saw another group of Indians whom the accused was with walking past\n\n    them…However, neither officer could confirm whether the group whom the accused was\n\n    with originated from the earlier group that had dispersed. In fact, Sgt Ahmad’s\n\n    evidence was that the accused’s group was walking behind the officers…The\n\n    overall impression given by the officers was that the accused’s group did not come\n\n    from the earlier group that dispersed…If it had been shown conclusively that\n\n    the accused was from the group that dispersed, the inference that he was \"armed\"\n\n    might have been stronger, that is, he might have been involved in the alleged fight.\n\n    (Emphasis added)16 The magistrate’s view that there might have been a stronger\n\ninference that the accused was \"armed\" if there were evidence of the accused\n\nhaving been involved in the alleged fight, implies that there has to be evidence of\n\nsurrounding circumstances suggesting the commission (for instance, being involved in\n\nviolence or robbery) or the imminent commission of an offence (for instance, the accused\n\nloitering near a car) before the accused can be said to be \"armed with\" a\n\ndangerous or offensive instrument. To impose such a requirement is tantamount to\n\nindirectly placing the burden on the prosecution to prove that the carrying of the\n\ninstrument was related to the commission of any offence, or that the accused was armed\n\nwith the instrument with some intent to commit an offence, an element which Parliament has\n\nalready removed from the provision in 1996. Section 22(1)(a) was amended in 1996 when the\n\nwords \"with intent to commit any offence\" was substituted with the phrase\n\n\"without lawful authority or a lawful purpose\". The attention of this court was\n\ndrawn to the speech of the Senior Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Home\n\nAffairs, Assoc Prof Ho Peng Kee, on 27 February 1996 in relation to the Miscellaneous\n\nOffences (Public Order and Nuisance) (Amendment) Bill:… under the existing section 22(1)(a), it is an offence for a\n\n    person to be armed with a dangerous or offensive instrumentwith intent to commit an\n\n    offence. This requires the prosecution to prove not only that the person is armed\n\n    with a dangerous or offensive instrument but also that he intended to commit an offence\n\n    with it. Unless the accused admits it, it is impossible to prove his intent.To\n\n    overcome this problem so as to facilitate prosecution, clause 9 of the Bill seeks\n\n    to create a new subsection (1A) to place on the accused the onus of proving that he has a\n\n    lawful purpose to be armed with the dangerous or offensive instrument. (Emphasis added)17 The next question is how should the words \"armed with\" be\n\nconstrued in the light of such considerations. Some guidance may be obtained from the\n\nAustralian and English authorities. InRowe v Conti[1958] VR 547, the defendant\n\nwas charged under s 69(1) of the Police Offences Act 1957 which reads as follows:Every person committing any of the following offences\n\n    shall be deemed an idle and disorderly person within this Part…(f)     Every person found armed with any sword\n\n    bludgeon or other offensive weapon or instrument: Provided that if such person being\n\n    thereto required by the court gives to the satisfaction of the court a good account of his\n\n    lawful means of support and assigns a valid and satisfactory reason for his being so armed\n\n    he shall be deemed not to be guilty of such offence.The police searched the defendant, Conti, outside a hotel and found\n\nthat he was not in possession of a knife. They subsequently found a knife in his car which\n\nwas in the back yard of the hotel. The Supreme Court of Victoria held that there was no\n\ncase to answer on the ground that the defendant was not \"found armed\" within the\n\nmeaning of s 69(1)(f). Gavan Duffy J said (at p 549):When Conti was searched by the police he was not \"armed\" in\n\n    any sense. I do not say that a man must necessarily have the weapon in his hand to be\n\n    armed with it, but he must have it immediately ready for use. The fact that he has in his\n\n    vehicle a weapon with which he can arm himself in a few minutes is not enough.18 The Supreme Court of Victoria inMiller v Hrvojevic[1972] VR\n\n305 had also considered the meaning of \"armed\" in the context of s 6(1)(e) of\n\nthe Vagrancy Act 1966 (at p 306):To be armed with a weapon means something more than to be in possession\n\n    of it; the weapon must also be available for immediate use as a weapon. No doubt questions\n\n    of fact and degree are involved. A man is armed with a pistol if he is wearing it in a\n\n    holster, though perhaps not if it is in the boot of his car. It is not necessary for it to\n\n    be in his hand for him to be armed with it. In the present case the knuckle duster was in\n\n    the defendant’s left-side trouser pocket, where it could easily and rapidly be\n\n    slipped onto his hand. Accordingly, I think the evidence establishes that he was found\n\n    armed with it.Section 6(1)(e) of the Vagrancy Act, which is rather similar to s\n\n22(1)(a) of the Act, provides as follows:Any person who –(e)     is found armed with an offensive weapon or\n\n    instrument unless such person gives to the court a valid and satisfactory reason for his\n\n    being so armed;…shall be guilty of an offence.19 In the English case ofR v Jones (Keith Desmond) [1987] 2 All\n\nER 692, the appellant was convicted under s 86 of the Customs and Excise Management Act\n\n1979, which makes it an offence to be \"armed with any offensive weapon\" while\n\nbeing concerned in smuggling. The appellant was the captain of a boat that was used to\n\nsmuggle drugs into England. Customs and police officers boarded the boat and they found,\n\napart from the drugs, two pistols in a locker in the wheel-house. The Court of Appeal\n\ndismissed the appeal against conviction and held that the expression \"armed\"\n\ninvolves either physically carrying arms, or it will involve proof that a defendant knows\n\nthat they are immediately available. The court was also of the view that in considering s\n\n86 of the 1979 Act, helpful guidance can be derived from the judgment of Scarman LJ inR\n\nv Kelt[1977] 3 All ER 1099, which was a case under s 18 of the Firearms Act 1968:Of course the classic case of having a gun with you is if you are\n\n    carrying it. But even if you are not carrying it, you may yet have it with you, if it is\n\n    immediately available to you. But if all that can be shown is possession in the sense that\n\n    it is in your house or in a shed or somewhere you have ultimate control, that is not\n\n    enough.20 In my opinion, the expression \"armed with a dangerous or\n\noffensive instrument\" in the context of s 22(1)(a) of the Act should be construed to\n\nmean being in actual physical possession of the instrument (whether it is carried on the\n\nperson or near to the person), which is immediately available and ready for use. The\n\nexpression does not include a situation, for instance, where a person is away from his\n\nhouse or his car in which the instrument is found. That person cannot be said to be\n\n\"armed with\" the instrument, even though he may have control or dominion over\n\nit, as it is not available for immediate use. In not requiring the prosecution to prove\n\nthat the accused has committed or will commit an offence, such a construction of the words\n\n\"armed with\" would be consistent with the intention of the amendment, which was\n\nto facilitate prosecution and enforcement of the law. This interpretation would also be in\n\nline with the purpose of s 22(1)(a), which is to prevent the use of dangerous or offensive\n\ninstruments and to allow timely action to be taken to reduce any opportunity to use such\n\ninstruments.21 Counsel for the accused contended that the prosecution’s case\n\nfell short of even showing that the accused was in possession of the screwdriver, much\n\nless could the evidence show that he was armed with the screwdriver. Counsel relied on\n\ncertain parts of the testimony of Sgt Ahmad in support of his submissions:Q: Put – you never saw this accused in possession\n\n  of the screwdriver as you alleged?A: Yes, I didn’t see he was in possession of the screwdriver.Q: Put – this accused was not armed with the screwdriver?A: He was not armed with the screwdriver.22 Counsel also drew the attention of the court to Cpl Ang’s\n\nevidence during cross-examination:Q: Do you agree that you cannot say what fell onto the ground on that\n\n  night from this accused person?A: Yes.23 Apart from Cpl Ang’s testimony given during cross-examination,\n\nI also noted the evidence given by Cpl Ang during examination-in-chief and re-examination.\n\nDuring examination-in-chief, Cpl Ang testified that he saw the accused shake his leg and\n\nthat a black object had landed near to the side of the road, but he could not see what the\n\nblack object was at that time. He was able to ascertain that the black object was a\n\nscrewdriver after he and Sgt Ahmad had caught up with the accused. In re-examination, Cpl\n\nAng gave the following evidence:Q: You said you saw a black-coloured object fall from\n\n  the accused?A: Yes.Q: Was it from his left or right hand side?A: Right hand side.Q: You later identified this screwdriver in court and it was the black\n\n  coloured object?A: Yes.Q: How can you be so sure that this black object is the screwdriver?A: When I saw the black object falling off, I remembered the location\n\n  where it landed.Q: You saw it landed and you remembered the location where it landed,\n\n  what made you so sure that the screwdriver fell from the accused and not from anyone else?A: I saw the black object falling and he was trying to shake it away.I would also point out at this juncture that Sgt Ahmad had clearly\n\ntestified in court that the accused had dropped the screwdriver to his right side, which\n\nfell along the seams of the trousers and got hooked at the bottom end of his trousers, and\n\nhe had then attempted to shake it off his trousers.24 In my view, an inference that the accused was \"armed with a\n\ndangerous or offensive instrument\" could reasonably be drawn from the evidence, there\n\nbeing no dispute that the screwdriver was such an instrument. I was therefore of the view\n\nthat the prosecution had made out a case which, if unrebutted and uncontradicted, would\n\nwarrant the conviction of the accused. In the circumstances, the magistrate should have\n\ncalled for the defence whereupon the burden would be on the accused to show that he had\n\nlawful purpose or lawful authority to be armed with the screwdriver.",
