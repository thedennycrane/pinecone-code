        "Conclusion": "16        While the courts have an unfettered discretion to extend time in cases where it is just to do so, this discretion must be exercised in accordance with the principles and policies underpinning the concept of arbitration: see, for example,The Faith([14]supra) at 411;Pioneer Shipping Ltd v BTP Tioxide Ltd[1982] AC 724.It must also be emphasised that where parties voluntarily allow the time limit to expire not marginally butvery substantially, a party should not be allowed, save in exceptional circumstances, to challenge the finality of the award. The fundamental agreement of the parties is the same as the policy of the law,ie, that an award made with jurisdiction should be final: seeThe Faith([14]supra) at 412. 17        It is evident that the plaintiff was quite content not to prosecute this matter diligently as it had incurred a liability to pay a substantial sum to the defendant pursuant to the First Award. In its attempt to challenge the First Award it sought to raise several unmeritorious issues,ie,the remaining issues. I can only infer from the plaintiff’s conduct that it has, since the issuance of the Second Award, employed every legal strategy available either by omission and/or commission to deprive the defendant of the fruits of litigation. This should no longer be tolerated or permitted. Extensions for time to file applications for leave to appeal against an arbitration award should be scrupulously assessed so as never to detract from the parliamentary policy of promoting finality in arbitration awards. The longer and more inappropriate the delay the more reluctant the courts should be in acceding to such applications."
