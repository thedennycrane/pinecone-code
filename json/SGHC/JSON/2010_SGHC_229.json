        "Whether the application should be allowed": "7       O 20 r 5(1) of the Rules of Court\n                    (Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) provides as follows: Subject to Order 15 Rules 6, 6A, 7 and 8, and this Rule, the Court\n                        may at any stage of the proceedings allow the plaintiff to amend his writ,\n                        or any party to amend his pleading, on such terms as to costs or otherwise\n                        as my be just and in such manner (if any) as it may direct. 8       Whether an amendment to pleadings should be\n                    allowed is a matter of discretion for the trial judge. The approach that courts\n                    should take with respect to amendment of pleadings was outlined by the Court of\n                    Appeal inWright Norman and another v Oversea-Chinese Banking\n                        Corp Ltd[1993] 3 SLR(R) 640, at [6] as follows: It is trite law that an amendment which would enable the real issues\n                        between the parties to be tried should be allowed subject to penalties on\n                        costs and adjournment, if necessary, unless the amendment would cause\n                        injustice or injury to the opposing party which could not be compensated by\n                        costs or otherwise: seeCropper v Smith(1884)\n                        26 Ch D 700;Tildesley v Harper(1878)\n                        10 Ch D 393. This is so even though the omission was caused by\n                        carelessness or the application for amendment was made very late in the day:perBrett MR inClarapede & Co v Commercial Union Association[1883]\n                        32 WR 262 at 263. 9       The Court of Appeal added at [23] that the most\n                    important question the court must ask itself is whether or not the ends of\n                    justice are served by allowing the proposed amendments. 10     It does not always follow that an amendment\n                    should be allowed where the other party can be compensated with costs. InKetteman v Hansel Properties Ltd[1987]\n                    AC 189 (“Ketteman”) Lord\n                    Griffiths, who pointed out, at 220, that “justice cannot always be\n                    measured in terms of money” explained as follows: [A] judge is entitled to weigh in the balance the strain the litigation\n                        imposes on litigants, particularly if they are personal litigants rather\n                        than business corporations, the anxieties occasioned by facing new issues,\n                        the raising of false hopes, and the legitimate expectation that the trial\n                        will determine the issues one way or the other. 11     The courts have been careful to differentiate\n                    between an amendment that merely clarifies an issue in dispute and one that\n                    raises a totally different issue at too late a stage. As Lords Griffiths\n                    said inKetteman, at 220, “to allow an\n                    amendment before a trial begins is quite different from allowing it at the end\n                    of the trial to give an apparently unsuccessful defendant an opportunity to\n                    renew the fight on an entirely different defence.” 12Kettemanhas\n                    been applied in a number of cases in Singapore: seeSin Leng\n                        Industries Pte Ltd v Ong Chai Teck and others[2006]\n                    2 SLR(R) 235, Lam Soon Oil and Soap Manufacturing Sdn Bhd and another v\n                    Whang Tar Choung and another [2001] 3 SLR(R) 451 and   Hong Leong\n                    Finance Ltd v Famco (S) Pte Ltd and others [1992] 2 SLR(R)\n                224. 13     The present case was rather different from the\n                    situation envisaged inKetteman. Here, although\n                    the trial had been completed, no new evidence was required in relation to the\n                    proposed amendment to introduce the defence of consent to the use of an\n                    allegedly infringing trade mark. The facts pertaining to the proposed defence of\n                    consent were fully stated in Arthur’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief\n                    (“AEIC”). In his AEIC, Arthur stated that TCS had given his\n                    consent to the use of “???”\n                    by him for the VivoCity Stall when he and his father met TCS on 31 July\n                    2008. Furthermore, Arthur referred to a congratulatory message that had\n                    accompanied a pot of flowers sent by TCS to him when he started the VivoCity\n                    Stall. He pointed out that TCS’s congratulatory message, which was\n                    addressed to “???”, had\n                    included the words “May your business prosper”. Thus, Arthur\n                    asserted that TCS did not mind the use by him of\n                        “???”. 14     TCS’s counsel, Mr Deepak Natverlal\n                    (“Mr Natverlal”), cross-examined Arthur on his assertions that TCS\n                    had consented to his use of the name“???”.\n                    Arthur’s father, Mr Tung Chye Hong, was also cross-examined on the\n                    issue of consent. Apart from questioning Arthur on TCS’s alleged consent\n                    to the use of the name “???”\n                    for the VivoCity Stall, Mr Natverlal also cross-examined Arthur on\n                    TCS’s congratulatory message. 15     TCS was also given an opportunity to address\n                    the issue of the congratulatory message. He was cross-examined by Arthur on the\n                    message and during the trial, his counsel reiterated that his position was that\n                    despite the congratulatory message, he had not consented to the use by Arthur of\n                    the sign\n                “???”. 16     As for whether TCS had consented to\n                    Arthur’s use of his culinary awards to advertise the VivoCity Stall,\n                    Arthur claimed in his AEIC that he had had TCS’s “general\n                    consent” to use the said awards. He stated in his AEIC at paras 69, 71,\n                    73, 74 and 81 that: 69 At the same time when passing me the original\n                        certificates, my uncle did not see the point about keeping them as he said\n                        that “die already also cannot bring along” … 71 He was of the opinion that his sons (being disinterested\n                        in his noodle business) could not care less about the certificates. He\n                        wanted me to have them because he knew I treasured them. … 73 …. He told me to put them to good use. 74 He said that if they were used, at least these\n                        certificates and awards could keep him alive in the memory of the general\n                        public. … 81 I understood from this discussion with my uncle that I may use the\n                        certificates to develop the family’s pork noodle business so that it\n                        does not die out after him. 17     As the issue of consent had been outlined in\n                    Arthur’s AEIC and ventilated at the trial, to allow Arthur to amend his\n                    pleadings to include the issue of consent would have enabled the real issues\n                    between the parties to be tried without causing any injustice or injury to TCS\n                    which could not be compensated by costs. As the ends of justice would have been\n                    served by allowing the proposed amendments, I allowed Arthur’s application\n                    and awarded costs to TCS."
