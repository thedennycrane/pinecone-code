        "The background": "1. PT Kiani Kertas (the plaintiffs) appealed against the decision of the\n\nAssistant Registrar given on 2 May 2001, wherein she had granted part of the second defendant's\n\napplication (in summons-in-chambers no. 525 of 2001/J) by making the following order:Part of the Defence of the second defendant and his Counterclaim, relating to\n\n  the claim that Mr Gerald White on behalf of the plaintiffs had agreed with the second defendant\n\n  that any documents and information provided by the first and second defendants would not be used\n\n  against the defendants and the plaintiffs would not take any action against the defendants, be\n\n  tried first, and all other parts of the Defence and the plaintiffs claim be tried at a\n\n  subsequent trial and stayed in the meantime.2. I heard and allowed the plaintiffs' appeal in Registrar's Appeal No. 96 of\n\n2001 (the Appeal) on 24 May 2001; the second defendant has now appealed against my decision (in\n\nCivil Appeal No. 600085 of 2001).",
        "The facts": "3. According to the pleadings and the affidavits filed by the parties herein, the\n\nplaintiffs are a developer and owner of, a pulp mill in East Kalimantan (the project) of which one\n\nJim Endicott (Endicott) was their project director. Another gentleman by the name of Harold Helm\n\n(Helm) was the project director of PT Parama Simons, an Indonesian company which was appointed as\n\nthe plaintiffs' engineer for the project. In 1992, the plaintiffs invited companies to submit\n\ntenders as general contractors for construction of the pulp mill, which would be the largest single\n\nline pulp mill in South East Asia. The plaintiffs required bids to be submitted as part of a EPC\n\n(proposed engineering, procurement and construction) group.4. A Singapore company by the name of Commonwealth Asia Pacific Constructors Pte\n\nLtd (CAPC) submitted a bid to construct the project. CAPC was incorporated in 1993 by a Canadian\n\ncompany Commonwealth Construction Company (CCC) specifically for the purpose of bidding for the\n\nproject. Both Endicott and Helm opposed using CAPC for the construction as which result CAPC was not\n\nawarded the contract and accordingly informed in May 1994.5. PT Indorimagas Pratama (the first defendants) are an Indonesian company with\n\nwhich CAPC entered into a joint-venture agreement on 15 October 1993 (the joint venture agreement)\n\nto co-operate on the project; CAPC agreed to pay the first defendants a commission, for any sum\n\nreceived for the project. The plaintiffs alleged that the second defendant (who signed the\n\njoint-venture agreement on behalf of the first defendants) controls the first defendants as well as\n\nORN Holding (HK) Ltd (the third defendants). The plaintiffs alleged that the purported president of\n\nthe first defendants one Anna Mariana is the second defendant's secretary. According to searches\n\nconducted by the plaintiffs in the Registry of Companies, the second defendant is also a shareholder\n\nand director of a Singapore company known as Rimagas Services Pte Ltd; he described himself as the\n\ncompany's executive director.6. The plaintiffs alleged that in or about June 1994, CAPC, the first and second\n\ndefendants entered into a conspiracy with Endicott  without the plaintiffs' knowledge or consent,\n\nCAPC corruptly offered to Endicott a secret commission of US$1m if he did not raise objections to\n\nCAPC's bid and the company won the award for the project. On 2 June 1994, a letter was written by\n\nthe second defendant to CCC on the subject of appointing him as a director of CAPC. In a subsequent\n\nletter dated 19 July 1994 to CCC, the second defendant requested a monthly retainer from the former\n\nof US$5,000/-.7. The plaintiffs alleged that a separate conspiracy was entered into between\n\nHelm and CAPC, the first and second defendants whereby in exchange for a secret commission of US$1m\n\nin the event CAPC was awarded the contract for the project, Helm agreed not to raise objections to\n\nCAPC's bid.8. In October 1994, a second bid was made by CAPC for the construction of the\n\nproject. Neither Endicott nor Helm raised any objections to this bid. In the event, a contract in\n\nthe sum of US$102m (the contract) was awarded to CAPC on 20 December 1994. Construction of the\n\nproject was completed in mid-1997.9. Pursuant thereto, CAPC (together with the first and the second defendants)\n\npaid secret commissions, commencing in January 1995 to Endicott and Helm from monies in the first\n\ndefendants' bank account maintained in Singapore. To the plaintiffs' knowledge, the sums paid to\n\nEndicott and Helm therefrom in the period January 1995 to April 1997, totalled $848,153.87 each. The\n\nfirst defendants retained as their fees 15% of the secret commissions received from CAPC.10. In or about February or March 1996, CAPC (through its then vice-president\n\nBruce Ferrier [Ferrier]), the first and second defendants entered into a further conspiracy with\n\nEndicott. Without the plaintiffs' knowledge or consent, the conspiracy caused the plaintiffs to pay\n\nCAPC an extra US$6m above the contract's price (for payment of further secret commissions from CAPC\n\nto the first defendants) which were to be divided, equally between Endicott, Ferrier and the first\n\ndefendants.11. Sometime in 1996, the first and third defendants together with two (2)\n\nIndonesian companies PT Jaya Sumpiles (PTJS) and PT Nirmala Matranusa entered into another\n\nconspiracy with Helm without the plaintiffs' knowledge or consent. It was agreed that Helm would\n\naccept secret commissions from the two (2) defendants and the said Indonesian companies in exchange\n\nfor Helm favouring PTJS. Pursuant to the conspiracy, secret commissions were received by the third\n\ndefendants of at least US$654,017.59 from the said companies out of which the second defendant paid\n\nat least US$201,667.09 and US$83,3,381.91 to Endicott and Helm respectively.12. CAPC was wound-up by the Singapore Court in Companies Winding Up No. 191 of\n\n1998 on 21 August 1998 (by PT MBT Indonesia according to the court's records) at which time it still\n\nowed the second defendant a sum of US$631,028.14 under the joint venture agreement.13. In 1999, CAPC commenced arbitration proceedings in New York (the arbitration)\n\nagainst the plaintiffs in the sum of US$59m for damages and or sums due to CAPC under the contract\n\nawarded to them for the project. In the arbitration, the plaintiffs had relied on the secret\n\ncommissions as a defence while CAPC had claimed that the same were extorted from them by Endicott,\n\nHelm and others, that CAPC was the victim of the corruption, not the perpetrator. CAPC also alleged\n\nthat the plaintiffs were aware of and or their officers facilitated/participated in, the\n\nsolicitation of bribes by Endicott and Helm. Finally, CAPC contended that in any event they were not\n\nawarded the contract for the project because of the bribes. The second defendant however asserted\n\nthat CAPC secured the contract only because of the substantial lowering in the price of their bid.14. The plaintiffs alleged they first discovered the secret commissions some time\n\nin mid-1999 when told by the second defendant. The second defendant on the other hand, said he had\n\napproached Gerry White (GW) who was then the plaintiffs' managing-director (and later the\n\nvice-president) to request payment on certain outstanding invoices. It was GW who told the second\n\ndefendant about the arbitration and that he (GW) was aware about the 'monkey business' involving\n\nCAPC, Helm, Endicott. The second defendant claimed that GW offered to help the defendants to recover\n\nthe outstanding sum of US$631,028.14 due from CAPC in exchange for the defendants' assistance in\n\nhelping the plaintiffs to prove the 'monkey business'.15. Although the second defendant was aware of the various commissions paid to\n\nHelm and Endicott and others, he claimed he was not the party who agreed to pay those sums, he did\n\nnot receive any payments and, he did not assist any of them to dissipate the monies nor did he know\n\nthe fate of those payments.16. The first and second defendants asserted they were concerned that GW might\n\nuse against them the information they provided and informed GW accordingly. The second defendant\n\nalleged that GW then reassured him that whatever information or documents the two (2) defendants\n\nprovided would only be used against CAPC in the arbitration and not against them or for other\n\npurposes. Relying on these assurances, the first defendant entered into an agreement with the\n\nplaintiffs dated 7 October 1999 (the agreement) relating to the information and documents to be\n\nprovided by the second defendant, on the payments made to various parties. Pursuant thereto, on 20\n\nOctober 1999, the second defendant swore a statutory declaration (the statutory declaration) in\n\nSingapore, setting out his knowledge of events.17. Subsequently, a dispute arose between the two (2) defendants and GW over a\n\nUS$10m payment by the plaintiffs to CAPC. Consequently, the two (2) defendants refused to cooperate\n\nfurther with the plaintiffs, resulting in the plaintiffs suing them for and obtaining the documents\n\nin, Originating Summons No. 505 of 2000. I should point out that the plaintiffs applied for\n\ndiscovery for proceedings in Vancouver, British Columbia, against Endicott and Helm for recovery of\n\nthe bribes they had received.18. The plaintiffs commenced this suit in June 2000, seeking to recover from the\n\ndefendants jointly and severally, the sums of US$2m, US$420,000 and US$654,017.59 as monies had and\n\nreceived as well as under s 14 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (Cap 241) and, as constructive\n\ntrustees. There was a claim for damages together with an inquiry into and an account of all secret\n\ncommissions received by the defendants. The plaintiffs' attempt (in summons in chambers no. 720 of\n\n2000) to obtain summary judgment against the first and second defendant on 10 January 2001 was\n\nunsuccessful.19. One of the pleas raised in the (re-amended) Defence and Counterclaim filed by\n\nthe second defendant was, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to bring this action; they had\n\nbreached a collateral contract made with or an undertaking to, the second defendant, that in\n\nexchange for his/the first defendants giving to the plaintiffs information and documents relating to\n\npayment of secret commissions by CAPC to Endicott and Helm, the plaintiffs (through GW) would only\n\nuse the information/documents for the arbitration and not take any action or claim against the\n\ndefendants. By seeking to use the information and documents (including the statutory declaration) in\n\nthese proceedings, the plaintiffs had clearly breached the collateral contract/undertaking.20. The second defendant further denied he was a shareholder or officer of the\n\nfirst defendants but admitted he was a representative of the first defendants in respect of projects\n\nin Indonesia including the plaintiffs'. He averred that the payments in question were not bribes or\n\nsecret commissions.",
        "The application": "21. In summon in chambers no. 525 of 2001/J (the application), the second\n\ndefendant applied inter alia, for the following orders:(a) the plaintiffs' claim against him be struck out in whole or in part;(b) further or in the alternative, the plaintiffs' claim against him be stayed\n\npending the final award in the New York arbitration between the plaintiffs and CAPC;(c) in the alternative, that part of his Defence and Counterclaim relating to the\n\nclaim that the plaintiffs had agreed that any documents and information he and the first defendants\n\nprovided would not be used against the defendants and the plaintiffs would not take any action or\n\nclaim against the defendants, to tried first and, all other parts of the Defence and the plaintiffs'\n\nclaim be tried at a subsequent trial and stayed in the meantime.The learned Assistant Registrar only granted prayer (c) against which order the\n\nplaintiffs appealed.22. Before I turn to the Appeal, I need to refer further to the affidavit filed\n\nby the second defendant (on 7 March 2001) in support of the application; I shall only refer to the\n\nextracts relevant to the Appeal. The second defendant had in his affidavit, defended the joint\n\nventure agreement stating it was a common arrangement for many projects in Indonesia. He further\n\ncontended he only acted as an agent for the other defendants for payments made to Endicott and Helm\n\nfrom the first and third defendants' bank accounts and, it was in that capacity that he knew of the\n\npayments. Consequently he argued, the plaintiffs had no legal basis for their claims against him.\n\nFurther, there was a great possibility of the plaintiffs making a double claim in this suit and in\n\nthe arbitration.23. The second defendant contended that the current use by the plaintiffs/GW of\n\nthe information and documents he had provided was/is a breach of his rights as he would be extremely\n\nprejudiced by the continued use of the same against him. Unless his Defence and Counterclaim was\n\ntried first, his rights to prevent the use of the information and documents would be illusory as\n\nGW/the plaintiffs would have already had use of the documents to claim against him by then.",
        "The arguments": "24. In the court below, counsel for the second defendant pointed out that the\n\nplaintiffs had not pleaded any actual loss in their claim. He argued that the first defendants were\n\nnot a contractor of the project; hence if anyone was liable to disgorge the bribes, it would be CAPC\n\nwho took the US$2m, not the first and or the second defendants. He argued that there could be no\n\nconspiracy when the second defendant was told of the scheme after it was agreed.25. Counsel referred to O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court and also relied onFederal\n\nInsurance v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd[1992] 1 SLR 390to support his argument that a trial of\n\nthe preliminary issue would resolve both the claim and counterclaim thereby saving both time and\n\ncosts.26. On the other hand, counsel for the plaintiffs pointed out that it would be\n\nmore cumbersome to try the preliminary issue granted by the court below. A preliminary issue must\n\nresolve the entire case and even if the order below was upheld, the plaintiffs could still pursue\n\ntheir claim against the second defendant by means/ways other than the agreement and statutory\n\ndeclaration. He pointed out that in OS 505 of 2000, the same two (2) defendants there and here, did\n\nnot take the position that the documentation to be provided should only be used in the arbitration\n\nproceedings. Further, trial of the preliminary issue would not be appropriate as it involved both\n\nquestions of law and facts.27. Counsel also relied on the following extract from the agreement (page 2):-Indorimagas [the first defendant] understands that Kiani [the plaintiffs]\n\n  intends to seek recoupment from CAPC for all amounts paid to Indorimagas, and Indorimagas agrees\n\n  to provide reasonable cooperation to Kiani with respect to the pending arbitration between Kiani\n\n  and CAPC and with respect to Kiani's efforts to obtain recoupment from CAPC..Indorimagas\n\n  understands that its officers, directors and or employees may be required to give testimony in the\n\n  pending arbitration between Kiani and CAPC, and if necessary, Indorimagas agrees to make such\n\n  persons available to provide testimonyin the arbitration or any proceeding concerning the\n\n  project.(emphasis added)for his argument that the agreement clearly contemplated that the documents and\n\ninformation to be furnished by the two (2) defendants may be required for use in proceedings other\n\nthan the arbitration. If indeed there was the assurance which the second defendant alleged GW gave\n\nto him, it would have been incorporated into the agreement.28. Counsel for the plaintiffs submitted the parol evidence rule would in any\n\nevent bar either defendant from adducing evidence of any oral agreement, which terms were\n\ninconsistent with those in the agreement. Further, the first/second defendants had not produced any\n\ndocuments subsequent to the agreement to support the assurance they claimed the plaintiffs/GW gave\n\nthem. Finally, a separate trial of the preliminary issue would serve no useful purpose since it\n\nwould be carried out in the same manner as the trial of the main action namely, witnesses would have\n\nto testify on whether or not the alleged assurance was given.",
        "The decision": "29. I should first point out that in allowing the Appeal, I hadnotset\n\naside the order made below but merely varied it as follows:-that the part of the Defence and Counterclaim of the second defendant relating\n\n  to the claim that Mr Gerald White on behalf of the plaintiffs had agreed with the second defendant\n\n  that any document and information provided by the first and second defendants would not be used\n\n  against the defendants and the plaintiffs would not take any action or claim against the\n\n  defendants be triedby the same trial judge who will be deciding the other issues in the case,\n\n  before the main case proper, in one trial(emphasis added)30. The only difference between my order and that made by the court below was,\n\nthat trial of the other defences raised by the second defendant would not be stayed until after the\n\npreliminary issue had been determined but would follow immediately after the trial judge had tried\n\nthe preliminary issue. The trial judge has a discretion either:(i) to make a determination in favour of the second defendant on the\n\n  preliminary issue and rule that the plaintiffs cannot pursue their claim against either him or the\n\n  first defendants or,(ii) not make any ruling at all but direct that the other issues be tried\n\n  immediately.The second scenario is likely if the trial judge takes the view that the facts\n\nsurrounding the preliminary issue are so inextricably linked with the facts relating to the other\n\ndefences such as to make it impossible to determine the preliminary issue without considering the\n\nother defences.31. I turn now to the case cited by counsel for the second defendant. InFederal\n\nInsurance v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd, the question for determination by way of a preliminary\n\nissue was whether the claim by the sub-contractors on the insurers of the main contractors was\n\ntime-barred. The insurers had pleaded time-bar in their defence and counterclaim and then applied\n\nfor an order that the preliminary issue of whether the claim was in fact time-barred be tried. Their\n\napplication was dismissed by the registrar as well as the judge in chambers on appeal. The insurers\n\nthen appealed to the Court of Appeal. In dismissing their appeal, the appellate court held:(1) Questions of construction of documents are suitable for decision as\n\n  preliminary points but they may not be so if there are also disputes as to the factual matters\n\n  affecting the point of construction. It is a question of the degree or magnitude of these\n\n  preliminary factual issues in each case. In the instant case, there were disputed questions of\n\n  fact which had first to be resolved before the preliminary point could be tried...................................................................(3) As a general rule, the court will not exercise its power to order the trial\n\n  of a preliminary point of law, whether or not that point involves the prior determination of\n\n  factual disputes affecting that point, unless that trial of that issue would result in a\n\n  substantial saving of time and expenditure in respect of the trial of the action as a whole\n\n  (including the counterclaim). It was a matter of discretion for the court to exercise in the\n\n  circumstances of each case.(4) It was true that if the preliminary points were decided in favour of the\n\n  appellants they would not have to prove their other defences to the claim, but the appellants also\n\n  had a counterclaim which was founded on the same averments of fact as the other defences.\n\n  Therefore, whichever way the preliminary point went, the counterclaim still had to be tried. This\n\n  meant that relatively little time or expense would have been saved by an order to try the\n\n  preliminary issue first.32. Next, I turn my attention to the second defendant's pleadings. Like the\n\nappellants inFederal Insurance v Nakano Singapore (Pte) Ltd, the second defendant has a\n\ncounterclaim which is founded on his defence that there was a collateral contract with the\n\nplaintiffs and or undertaking from them that, they would not seek to use the documents/information\n\nagainst him. In his counterclaim, the second defendant inter alia, sought, a declaration that the\n\ncollateral contract is valid and binding and an injunction to restrain the plaintiff from using any\n\ninformation he/the first defendant disclosed, pursuant to the agreement (including the statutory\n\ndeclaration).33. In order to prove his counterclaim which was inextricably tied up with his\n\ndefences, the second defendant would have to adduce oral evidence (there being no supporting\n\ndocuments) to contradict the express terms in the agreement (referred to at para 27 above). This was\n\nnot a case where he was relying on a document to prove a point of law, rather it was the reverse; he\n\nhad the more onerous task of disproving the express terms of an agreement. Trying the preliminary\n\nissue would not resolve his other defences including the issues of whether there was an implied term\n\nand or estoppel, let alone his counterclaim. It would have to be determined on the facts whether the\n\nplaintiffs/GW did give the second defendant the assurance he alleged. If a finding is made that such\n\nan assurance was given, the question of law to be decided would then be whether the plaintiffs are\n\nthereby precluded from suing the first/second defendants. Trial of the preliminary issue involving\n\nfacts and law would not determine the matter between the parties one way or the other, rather it\n\nwould result in an unjustified waste of time and an equally unjustified increase in costs (perChang\n\nMin Tat J in Chan Kum Loong v Hii Sui Eng[1980] 1 MLJ 313at p 314).34. My view is reinforced by O 33 r 2 of the Rules of Court which counsel for the\n\nsecond defendant relied on. It states:The Court may order any question or issue arising in a cause or matter, whether\n\n  of fact or law or partly of fact and partly of law, and whether raised by the pleadings or\n\n  otherwise, to be tried before, at or after the trial of the cause or matter, and may give\n\n  directions as to the manner in which the question or issue shall be stated.The order which I made was in the spirit of this Order.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
