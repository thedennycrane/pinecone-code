        "Held,": "allowing the appeal :(1)    The evidence did not support any award for future surgery on the\n\nplaintiff’s cervical spine. The evidence of her expert was that he could not predict\n\nwhether this would be required. Possibilities are not, however probabilities, and the\n\ncourt works on the balance of probabilities. The evidence did, however, support an award\n\nfor the cost of a shoulder operation since this has been recommended by both doctors as\n\nthe plaintiff continues to experience symptoms in her right shoulder. The present cost of\n\na shoulder operation would be in the vicinity of $8,000 if the plaintiff goes to an A\n\nclass ward in Singapore General Hospital. There is no evidence as to cost of other medical\n\ntreatment such as physiotherapy and traction and drugs, as such it is not considered that\n\nthe award could take these costs into account. The award for future medical expenses is\n\nhence varied from $14,000 to $8,000.(2)    It appears that the injuries which the plaintiff sustained did\n\nhave an effect on her employment. Her complaints at work were consistent with those\n\ninjuries. The plaintiff’s explanation that she was trying to preserve the prospects\n\nof future employment by not disclosing her real reason for leaving Federal Publications is\n\nan acceptable one. Nevertheless, she had been advised by her doctor in March 2001 to\n\nundergo an operation to deal with her shoulder pain. The defence pointed out that the\n\nplaintiff had a duty to mitigate her losses. Accordingly, the award for pre-trial losses\n\nwas $1,500 per month for 27 months, reduced from 33 months, for the period from April 1999\n\nto March 2001(3)    Although the accident has meant that an editing career would be\n\ndifficult for the plaintiff to maintain, it has not affected her main skills or her\n\nability to exploit those skills profitably. Whilst her earning ability has been adversely\n\naffected by the accident the circumstances of the case make an award for loss of earnings\n\ncapacity more appropriate than one for the loss of future earnings. The editing path was\n\none that was new to the plaintiff and it is not possible to be certain that she would have\n\ncontinued in that line. There are other remunerative avenues still open to her. However,\n\nbearing in mind the fact that her ability to earn a good income may be limited from time\n\nto time by the after effects of the accidents, an award of $70,000 for the loss of earning\n\ncapacity would be reasonable. The basis of this award is the sum of $500 a month for 11\n\nyears rounded upwards to reflect a fair estimation of the impact the accident has had on\n\nthe plaintiff’s earning capacity.JudgmentCur Adv VultGROUNDS OF DECISION1. The plaintiff, Madam Karuppiah Nirmala, was driving her motorcar on\n\n14 July 1998 when it was hit by a bus driven by an employee of the defendant bus company.\n\nAs a result, the plaintiff experienced acute pain in her neck, shoulders and arms.\n\nSubsequently, she was diagnosed as having sustained injuries in both her shoulders as well\n\nas her cervical spine.2. The plaintiff obtained interlocutory judgment against the defendants\n\nin July 2000 for damages to be assessed. The assessment took place in December last year\n\nand she was awarded the following damages:(1)Pain and suffering and loss of amenities(a) cervical spine injury(including prospect of osteoarthritis)$ 14,000.00(b) shoulder injury$ 10,000.00(2)Agreed special damages – medical expenses$ 2,867.69(3)Agreed transport costs$ 430.00(4)Pre-trial loss of earnings (33 x $1,500)$ 49,500.00(5)Future medical expenses(surgery for shoulder & treatment for spine)$ 14,000.00(6)Loss of future earnings ($1,500 x 11 x 12)$198,000.00The defendants appealed against the awards in respect of future medical\n\nexpenses, pre-trial loss of earnings and loss of future earnings.Future medical expenses3. The award for future medical expenses of $14,000 covered surgery of\n\nthe plaintiff’s shoulder and treatment for her neck.4. The medical evidence was provided by two doctors. The first was Dr\n\nA. K. Mitra, a senior consultant orthopaedic surgeon at Singapore General Hospital. He\n\nfirst saw the plaintiff the day after the accident when she had acute pain in her cervical\n\nspine associated with referred pain down both her shoulders. His examination of the\n\ncervical spine showed tenderness, restriction of rotation and minimum muscle spasm. In\n\ncourt Dr Mitra explained that this was a hyperextension injury: the ligament holding the\n\nfront of the bone was tender and the joints at the back were injured and swollen and, as a\n\nresult, had put pressure on the nerve and caused pain. Examination of her shoulders showed\n\nsigns of impingement syndrome secondary to rotator cuff injury and restricted abduction on\n\nboth her shoulders. An x-ray of her spine showed evidence of cervical spondylosis. The\n\nplaintiff was initially treated with muscle relaxant and neurobion (vitamin B).5. Two days later, the plaintiff saw Dr Mitra again. By then she had\n\nstarted to experience right sided radiculopathy down to her upper right extremity. This\n\nmeant that she had distribution of pain along the nerve root on that side. She also showed\n\nsigns of diminished sensation in her right palm as well as tenderness over the right\n\nsupraspinatous muscle (the muscle on the shoulder). She was treated with physiotherapy,\n\nanalgesics and neurobion.6. Dr Mitra reviewed the plaintiff in June 1999. By then she was\n\nshowing signs of recovery. She had recovered from her acute pain from her cervical spine\n\ninjury but it was his opinion that she would experience chronic pain secondary to disc\n\ndegeneration. She might develop degenerated disc prolapse. Due to her cervical spine\n\npathology she would find it painful to read, write and type and might develop facetal\n\njoint osteoarthritis in her cervical spine which may eventually lead to restricted\n\nmovement of her cervical spine. Regarding her right shoulder, Dr Mitra opined that the\n\ntear of her supraspinatous muscle would be permanent and she would continue to suffer\n\nchronic pain in her right shoulder, though it might be intermittent. There was a\n\npossibility of extension of the tear and if so she would require surgical procedure to\n\nrepair the torn muscle provided that conservative management failed.7. In March 2001, Dr Mitra issued a letter in response to various\n\nqueries from the plaintiff’s solicitors. He stated there that it would be difficult\n\nfor him to predict when the plaintiff would require surgery for her cervical spine and her\n\nshoulder. The period of hospitalisation would be between three and five days for each\n\noperation. The estimated cost of surgery would be about $10,000 for the cervical spine\n\ninjury and $8,000 for the shoulder. There was a risk of complications with the cervical\n\nspine operation but none with the shoulder surgery.8. In court, Dr Mitra explained that as far as the shoulder surgery was\n\nconcerned, usually a doctor would wait for six months after the injury was sustained to\n\nsee whether symptoms continued. Only then would surgery be recommended to repair the\n\nmuscle. His estimated cost of $8,000 was based on the Singapore General Hospital’s\n\nrate and he agreed that it would cost more in a private hospital. As for the neck, he\n\nrepeated that it was not necessary to do surgery at this stage and that it is\n\nunpredictable when the plaintiff would need surgery. It would depend on whether she took\n\ncare of her neck.9. Under cross-examination, Dr Mitra confirmed that the estimate of\n\n$10,000 for the spinal procedure was based on A class rates. If the plaintiff was treated\n\nin class B2 the cost would be about $3,000 to $4,000. There would also be an additional\n\ncost of $2,000 to $3,000 for monitoring the spinal cord. This would be incurred regardless\n\nof class. The $10,000 reflected only the surgical fees and not the hospitalisation cost.10. The defendants called their own expert, Dr Ngian Kite Seng, a\n\nconsultant orthopaedic surgeon in private practice. Dr Ngian saw the plaintiff in November\n\n2000. He then issued a medical report.11. Dealing with the cervical spine injury, Dr Ngian noted that the\n\nplaintiff had complained of neck-ache with associated numbness of the right arm on and\n\noff. She told him that she was unable to tolerate editorial work for more than ten minutes\n\nbecause of neck pain. Dr Ngian’s physical examination of the plaintiff showed that\n\nshe had no objective neurological deficits. His diagnosis was that she had a whiplash type\n\ninjury to her cervical spine and this had aggravated her then existing cervical\n\nspondylosis.12. In Dr Ngian’s opinion, the plaintiff was likely to continue to\n\nhave chronic neck-ache and episode radiculopathy. Her injury would have aggravated her\n\ncervical spondylosis and accelerated its deterioration and that might in the long term\n\nlead to sufficient pain or neurological compromise so as to require surgery.13. As regards the plaintiff’s right shoulder, her complaint was\n\nof pain in the shoulder when she undertook lifting overhead activities. On examination, Dr\n\nNgian found that her right shoulder motion was limited in active flexion to 140,\n\nabduction to 120 and internal rotation to 40. In his opinion, these findings were\n\nconsistent with impingement syndrome from rotator cuff injury. These may continue to cause\n\nher pain and stiffness. There was an option of surgical debridement and repair of the\n\nrotator cuff and this may improve her function and lessen the symptoms. Finally, as\n\nregards the left shoulder Dr Ngian stated that the plaintiff had no complaints about it\n\nand he had not found any problem on examination.14. In court, Dr Ngian elaborated that surgery to the cervical spine\n\nwould only be necessary if there was spinal cord compression or neurological changes\n\nresulting in significant of power or sensation or disabling pain. There was a risk of cord\n\ninjury or paralysis if such surgery was undertaken.15. Under cross-examination, Dr Ngian confirmed that he had agreed\n\ngenerally with Dr Mitra’s opinion. It was possible that the plaintiff’s\n\ncondition would deteriorate in the future. As regards the cost of surgery, in a private\n\nhospital, the cost of the cervical spine surgery would be between $10,000 and $20,000 and\n\nfor the shoulder, $8,000. This could include hospitalisation. If the hospitalisation was\n\nfor a period of between three and five days, then at Mount Alvernia Hospital the cost\n\nwould be between $8,000 and $10,000 in a B1 ward and at Gleneagles and Mount Elizabeth\n\nhospitals, the cost would be 30% more. Dr Ngian also agreed with Dr Mitra’s\n\nsuggestion that the plaintiff should take more rest and go for physiotherapy.16. The submission made by the defendants was that it was unlikely that\n\nan operation to her neck would ever be undertaken and therefore no award should be made.\n\nAt present there was no indication that any operation was required. The medical evidence\n\nwas that if over time a compression of the spinal cord occurs then operation would be\n\nneeded. It was submitted that there was no evidence on how great a likelihood there was\n\nthat such a condition would develop. In fact the evidence was that it was completely\n\nunpredictable that such neck surgery would be required. As regards the shoulder operation,\n\nit would cost only $4,000 for both hospitalisation and surgeon’s fees if the\n\nplaintiff was treated in a B2 ward and the award of $14,000 should be reduced to $4,000.17. The plaintiff’s submission on this point was that although the\n\ncost of both operations including the cost of paraphernalia would come to more than\n\n$20,000, the Assistant Registrar had made an award of $14,000 for the cost of surgery to\n\nthe shoulder and for treatment to the spine as there was evidence from both medical\n\nexperts that the plaintiff would require conservative treatment such as painkillers,\n\nmuscle relaxant, intermittent physiotherapy and traction, which would minimise symptom for\n\nthe neck but would not cure. Having regard to the evidence of the medical experts and\n\nauthorities recognising that in future medical costs would increase, the plaintiff\n\nsubmitted that the award was reasonable.18. In my judgment, the evidence did not support any award for future\n\nsurgery on the plaintiff’s cervical spine. The evidence of her expert was that he\n\ncould not predict whether this would be required. It was a possibility. Possibilities are\n\nnot, however, probabilities and the court works on the balance of probabilities. The\n\nevidence did support an award for the cost of a shoulder operation since this has been\n\nrecommended by both doctors as the plaintiff continues to experience symptoms in her right\n\nshoulder. The present cost of a shoulder operation would be in the vicinity of $8,000 if\n\nthe plaintiff goes to an A class ward in Singapore General Hospital. The plaintiff’s\n\nmedical expenses up to the time of trial were incurred on an A class basis and there is no\n\nreason to require her to go to a B class ward. Although in the future medical costs may\n\nincrease, there is no reason for the plaintiff to delay her surgery indefinitely since it\n\ncan result in an immediate benefit to her and should be undertaken early. Accordingly, I\n\nconsider that the plaintiff should be awarded $8,000 for the cost of surgery to her\n\nshoulder. I do not see any evidence as to the cost of other medical treatment such as\n\nphysiotherapy and traction and drugs and accordingly do not consider that an award can\n\ntake these costs into account. I would therefore vary the Assistant Registrar’s award\n\nfrom $14,000 to $8,000.",
        "Loss of earnings: (a) Pre-trial": "19. The plaintiff is now 42 years old. At the time of the accident, she\n\nwas 38 and was married with two young children. She holds a Bachelor of Arts Degree from\n\nthe National University of Singapore and a Master of Science in Child Development from\n\nWheelock College in the United States.20. Since obtaining her masters degree, the plaintiff has worked in\n\nareas relating to children. She was with the People’s Association for ten years,\n\nspending the second five years as a childcare inspector. She then worked as an educational\n\nstrategist with a company called Times Learning System for about one year. This job\n\ninvolved the production of CD-ROMS for children. In 1997, she joined Federal Publications\n\nas an editor of children’s books. At the same time, she was also a part-time lecturer\n\nwith the Kinderland Learning Centre.21. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was holding down two\n\njobs. As an editor, she was earning $4,300 a month and her duties involved extensive\n\ntyping, editing, proof-reading of manuscripts and working on a computer. After completing\n\nthe ten days medical leave she was given after the accident, the plaintiff went back to\n\nwork as an editor. She stated, however, that she faced a lot of difficulty in coping with\n\nher work and meeting her deadlines because of the pain in her neck and shoulder. The\n\nplaintiff resigned from Federal Publications in March 1999. She informed the court that\n\nthis was because she could not cope with the job anymore. Her letter of resignation did\n\nnot, however, mention her medical condition. Instead, it stated that she was leaving in\n\norder to spend more time with her children.22. Thereafter, the plaintiff carried on with her work as a part-time\n\nlecturer in Kinderland. She also took on an additional role as a practicum supervisor. She\n\nwas able to cope with these jobs she said as her duties were less strenuous and there was\n\nflexibility in the hours that she was required to work. Further, she was able to turn down\n\nan assignment if she was unable to do it. However, even in these occupations, the\n\nplaintiff would develop pain in her shoulders and neck whenever she had a hectic work day.23. The plaintiff’s evidence was that after resigning from Federal\n\nPublications, her average monthly earnings for the years ending 1999 and 2000 were $2,500\n\nand $2,460 respectively. She had therefore suffered a loss of about $1,900 a month. She\n\nasked the court to award her a reasonable sum for her pre-trial loss of earnings. The\n\naward made by the Assistant Registrar was $1,500 per month for 33 months in respect of\n\npre-trial loss of earnings. The same multiplicand was used for post-trial loss of earnings\n\nwith a multiplier of 11 years based on the plaintiff’s present age.24. The submission made by the defendants was that from the evidence\n\ntendered by the plaintiff for a three month period, it appears that she works only ten\n\ndays a month and that each session is three hours long. Notwithstanding her injuries, and\n\neven if it is true that she cannot do a 9 to 5 job, she is not operating at optimum\n\ncapacity. Further, the letter of resignation the plaintiff submitted to her employers was\n\ntelling. She did not need to give her employers a reason for her resignation but she chose\n\nto tell them that she wanted to spend more time with her children. The defendants\n\nsubmitted that this was the real reason why she left Federal Publications and it made\n\nsense because the children were then aged five and nine and the elder child was headed\n\ntowards the streaming examination.25. The plaintiff had said that her real reason for resigning was that\n\nshe could not hold the job because of the pain and that working a full day was too\n\nstressful for her. Supporting her stand on this was the evidence of a former colleague who\n\nconfirmed that the plaintiff had complained of pain and difficulty coping after the\n\naccident. The defendants were not impressed. They said that she managed to work for seven\n\nmonths and had only had physiotherapy for three or four months after the accident. This\n\nshowed that the injury was not as serious as the plaintiff complained.26. The plaintiff’s explanation for not giving the real reason for\n\nher resignation to her employers was that she did not want to jeopardise her chances of\n\nre-employment or of part-time work by revealing her medical condition. She also said that\n\nshe had done her best to keep the job but had simply not been able to cope because the\n\nwork involved movement of the neck and shoulder and this caused her pain. She was\n\nsupported in this by Dr Mitra who testified that the plaintiff’s movements were still\n\nrestricted and that reading, writing and other activities of daily living could cause her\n\npain. He stated that when she saw him in March 2001, he had advised her to consider\n\nsurgery. Dr Ngian also testified that the combination of disabilities arising from both\n\nthe shoulder and neck injuries could affect the plaintiff’s work as a full-time\n\neditor.27. It appears to me that the injuries that the plaintiff sustained did\n\nhave an effect on her employment. Her complaints were consistent with those injuries and\n\nthose complaints were of such a nature as to make it very difficult for her to endure the\n\nprolonged computer usage that editing work involves. The plaintiff’s explanation for\n\nnot leaving her job as an editor for seven months was a reasonable one. She did her best\n\nto carry on and then found it was not possible. I also accept that the plaintiff was\n\ntrying to preserve the prospects of future employment by not disclosing her real reason\n\nfor leaving Federal Publications.28. In my judgment, the plaintiff is entitled to compensation for loss\n\nof earnings prior to the trial. The question is as to the period. The period of 33 months\n\nawarded by the Assistant Registrar stretched from April 1999 to October 2001. The\n\nplaintiff, however, had been advised by Dr Mitra in March 2001 that she could go for an\n\noperation to deal with her shoulder pain. It is reasonable to assume that if she had taken\n\nhis advice and acted fairly expeditiously she would have recovered from the operation by\n\nthe end of June 2001 by which time she would have been much better. The defendants pointed\n\nout that the plaintiff had a duty to mitigate her loss. I agree. Accordingly, I am\n\nreducing the multiplier from 33 months to 27 months. This means that the award for\n\npre-trial loss of earnings is reduced from $49,500 to $40,500.",
        "(b) Post-trial loss of earnings": "29. The issue here is whether the plaintiff should have been awarded\n\nfuture loss of earnings or whether the correct award would have been one for loss of\n\nearning capacity. The plaintiff’s submission below was that she was entitled to\n\nfuture loss of earnings because she was no longer able to work as a full-time editor due\n\nto her medical condition. This argument was accepted below.30. On appeal, the defendants submitted that the editorial work on the\n\nbasis of which the plaintiff claimed the loss of future earnings, took up a period of one\n\nand a half years out of a total career period of 15 years. Since the accident, she had\n\ngone back to what she had been doing before her stint in editing. They submitted that the\n\nplaintiff was not disabled from pursuing her vocation in which she had adequate training\n\nand plenty of experience and in fact was now carrying on. That work would pay comparably\n\nto her editor’s work once she was able to take on additional assignments. At the time\n\nof the hearing she was giving two or three lectures a week and working as a practicum\n\nsupervisor between one and three times a week. She had quite a number of free hours a week\n\nand it would not be difficult for her to work up to three hours a day and there would be\n\nreasonable opportunities for her to take up work assignments for up to five days a week.\n\nThis would be particularly so if her shoulder injury is corrected.31. I accept the defendants’ submissions. In my opinion, although\n\nthe accident has meant that an editing career would be difficult for the plaintiff to\n\nmaintain, it has not affected her main skills or her ability to exploit those skills\n\nprofitably. At the same time, there may be some restriction on her ability to work long\n\nhours on a continuous basis even after the shoulder operation since she has to take care\n\nof her neck in order to avoid complications in that area. Whilst her earning ability has\n\nbeen adversely affected by the accident the circumstances of the case make an award for\n\nloss of earnings capacity more appropriate than one for the loss of future earnings. The\n\nediting path was one that was new to the plaintiff and it is not possible to be certain\n\nthat she would have continued in that line. There are other remunerative avenues still\n\nopen to her.32. The submission made by the defendants was that an award of $50,000\n\nwould be sufficient to compensate the plaintiff for medical problems that might prevent\n\nher, from time to time, from working five days in a week. Before the Assistant Registrar\n\nthe plaintiff’s solicitors had cited various cases to serve as a guide in case an\n\naward was made for a loss of earning capacity. In those cases, an oil rigger was awarded\n\n$180,000, a Mr Atkinson was awarded $350,000 (it was not clear from the report given to me\n\nwhat the plaintiff’s previous occupation was), a mechanic was given an award of\n\n$25,000 for loss of earning capacity in addition to an award for loss of future earnings,\n\nand a carpenter was awarded $25,000. None of those cases is, with respect, of much\n\nassistance in the present instance.33. The plaintiff here is a professional and a person with her\n\nqualifications can command reasonably good remuneration whether she works on a full or\n\npart-time basis. She now earns approximately $2,500 a month lecturing two to three times a\n\nweek and doing her practicum duties one to three times a week. She should be able to earn\n\nat least another $1,000 a month even if she is unable to work five days a week (even on a\n\npart-time basis) because of the need to safeguard her physical condition. Bearing in mind\n\nthe fact that her ability to earn a good income may thus be limited from time to time by\n\nthe after effects of the accident I think that an award of $70,000 for loss of earning\n\ncapacity would be reasonable. The basis of this award is the sum of $500 a month for 11\n\nyears rounded upwards to reflect what I consider a fair estimation of the impact the\n\naccident has had on the plaintiff’s earning capacity.",
        "Conclusion": "34. In conclusion, the appeal will be allowed and the awards made below\n\nwill be set aside and replaced by the awards made in this judgment. I will see the parties\n\non costs.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
