        "Division of matrimonial flat.": "4. The learned DJ, in a fairly detailed judgment, has given her reasons why she apportioned the matrimonial flat in the ratio 60:40. In doing so, however, the DJ formed the view that the husband’s and wife’s direct financial contribution towards the matrimonial flat was 44% and 56% respectively. This was incorrect. The direct contribution by the husband was 62% and by the wife was 38%. If the renovation loan taken by the wife was factored in, the percentage would be 55% contribution by the husband and 45% contribution by the wife.

The error by the DJ, in respect of the respective direct contributions of the parties to the purchase of the matrimonial flat, would have affected her decision in the apportionment of the flat. As the DJ had misdirected herself in this regard, I reviewed the available evidence and came to the determination that an equitable apportionment of the matrimonial flat would be 50% to the husband and 50% to the wife with each party reimbursing their respective CPF account with his or her share of the proceeds.

The children, who are now in their early teens, were brought up in a middle-class environment and their education had always been supplemented with tuition and enrichment classes. Looking at the expenses of the children and the available resources of the parents, I felt that it would be appropriate in this case to vary the order of the DJ by making an order that the wife contribute $500 per month towards her children’s maintenance.7. I therefore allowed the appeal to the extent indicated above. The wife, dissatisfied with those orders, has now appealed.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
