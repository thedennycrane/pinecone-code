        "My decision": "25.    Section 93(1) and (2) of our Women’s Charter (Cap 353)\n\nstates:‘Jurisdiction of court in matrimonial proceedings93(1) Subject to subsection (2), the court shall have jurisdiction\n\n  to entertain proceedings for divorce, presumption of death and divorce, judicial\n\n  separation or nullity of marriage only if either of the parties to the marriage is -(a) domiciled in Singapore at the commencement of the proceedings; or(b) habitually resident in Singapore for a period of 3 years\n\n    immediately preceding the commencement of the proceedings.(2) In proceedings for nullity of marriage on the ground that the\n\n  marriage is void or voidable, the court may, notwithstanding the requirements in\n\n  subsection (1) are not fulfilled, grant the relief sought where both parties to the\n\n  marriage reside in Singapore at the time of the commencement of the proceedings.’26.    C’s divorce petition in Singapore is based on the ground\n\nthat both D and her have been habitually resident in Singapore for a period of three years\n\nimmediately preceding the filing of her divorce petition here. It seems to me that she was\n\nnot habitually resident in Singapore from July 1999. After she went to India for her\n\nmother’s funeral, she continued to reside there because of her marital woes. Be that\n\nas it may, it is not disputed that D was habitually resident in Singapore for a period of\n\nthree years immediately preceding the filing of C’s divorce petition.27.    Although D’s first prayer in his application had sought a\n\ndeclaration, his application was really for a dismissal or a stay of C’s divorce\n\npetition on the ground of forum non conveniens.28.    The principles of an application for a stay on the ground of\n\nforum non conveniens are not in dispute. I quote from para 16 of the judgment of Chao Hick\n\nTin JA inPT Hutan Domas Raya v Yue Xiu Enterprises (Holdings) Limited[2001] 2 SLR 49:‘… Unless there is clearly another more appropriate available\n\n  forum, a stay will ordinarily be refused. If the court concludes that there is such a more\n\n  appropriate forum, it will ordinarily grant a stay unless, in the words of Lord Goff [inThe\n\n  Spiliada], ‘there are circumstances by reason of which justice requires that a\n\n  stay should nevertheless not be granted. In this inquiry the court will consider all the\n\n  circumstances of the case, including circumstances which go beyond those taken into\n\n  account when considering connecting factors with other jurisdictions’ (hereinafter\n\n  referred to as ‘the unless question’ or ‘unless proviso’ as may be\n\n  appropriate in context). One such factor which would warrant a refusal of stay would be if\n\n  it can be established by objective cogent evidence that the plaintiff will not obtain\n\n  justice in the foreign jurisdiction. But the mere fact that the plaintiff has a legitimate\n\n  personal or juridical advantage in proceedings in Singapore is not decisive; regard must\n\n  be had to the interests of all the parties and the ends of justice. We would emphasis that\n\n  in determining the ‘unless question’ all circumstances must be taken into\n\n  account, including those taken into account in determining the question of the more\n\n  appropriate forum. However, in this stage of the inquiry the burden shifts to the\n\n  plaintiff.’29.    I have set out some of the undisputed facts regarding the\n\nParties. As for domicile, nothing is said in C’s divorce petition about the domicile\n\nof D and herself. It seems to me that her domicile is India. As for D, Mr Thomas said that\n\nhis domicile was Singapore although this is not asserted in any of D’s affidavits and\n\nit appeared to me during arguments that Mr Thomas was equating residence with domicile.30.    Although Singapore was the last place where the Parties last\n\nlived as husband and wife, I am of the view that they were residing in various\n\njurisdictions depending on where D was working. Having said that, I was informed by Mr\n\nThomas that D has permanent resident status in Singapore.31.    As for C, she claims to be a Non-Resident Indian (para 41 of her\n\naffidavit filed on 13 January 2001) but she did not elaborate as to what that means given\n\nthat she has been habitually residing in India since July 1999.32.    The assets of the parties are ‘internationally placed’,\n\nto use a term from the submissions of C’s Counsel, Mr Imran H Khwaja. As derived from\n\nD’s affidavit filed on 31 October 2000, and based on estimates of exchange rates,\n\nthey are:Monies(a) In Singapore - about S$110,000 to S$120,000 (excluding\n\n  household goods)(b) In Hong Kong - about S$500,000(c) In United Kingdom - about S$50,000Immovable Property(d) In London, a property at 44 Wellington Court, which was in both\n\n  the names of the Parties. It was mortgaged. The property has been sold and presumably the\n\n  mortgage has been paid. There is apparently a surplus but I was not told what the surplus\n\n  was.(e) In India, D owns two properties:(i) The first is a flat with a terrace on the 2ndFloor at\n\n    A-53, Nizammuddin East, Delhi, estimated by C to be worth about S$180,000 to S$190,000.(ii) The second is a piece of land in Victoria Meadows, Bangalore,\n\n    estimated by C to be about S$30,000.(f) Neither D nor C own any immovable property in Singapore. They were\n\n  staying in rented premises here.I stress that the above is not a finding of fact by me as to what the\n\nParties’ assets are as more information and more supporting evidence must be given to\n\nestablish the assets.33.    Notwithstanding C’s contention in para 25 of her affidavit\n\nfiled on 13 January 2000 that the terms of the settlement are void in view of the decision\n\nof the District Judge of 29 July 2001 in respect of the Second Petition, Mr Imran quite\n\nproperly conceded that he could not go so far as to say that there had actually been a\n\nruling on the validity of the settlement. It is not in dispute that the settlement was\n\nwith a view to the filing of a divorce petition by consent in India and that it contained\n\nterms relating to the division of property, custody and maintenance.34.    In these circumstances, Mr Imran did not dispute that India is\n\nthe most appropriate forum to determine the validity of the settlement and its effect on\n\nthe present appeal by D to the Supreme Court of India as well as in any other matrimonial\n\nproceeding that either side may file there. He, however, submitted that the settlement is\n\nnot a factor in deciding which is the more appropriate forum for C’s divorce petition\n\nand that it went into the merits of any claim by either party.35.    He further submitted that even if the settlement had not been\n\nentered into involuntarily by C, our courts and the Indian courts would not hold her to it\n\nas its terms were manifestly unfair to C. On this point, he highlighted that under the\n\nsettlement, she was to receive only 30,000 rupees, equivalent to about S$1,200, a month\n\nfor the maintenance of the children irrespective of the income of D. On the other hand, I\n\nnote that this is not the only term of the settlement. For example, under it, D is to\n\npurchase educational policies for the two children guaranteeing the equivalent of fees of\n\na minimum sum of US$152,000.36.    For his part, Mr Thomas stressed the existence of the settlement,\n\nthe fact that it was entered into with the assistance of Pranab and that there is a\n\npending appeal to the Supreme Court of India based on the settlement. D also alleged that\n\nthe Parties have acted upon the settlement although this is denied by C.37.    Mr Imran countered with the argument that even if D succeeds in\n\nhis appeal to the Supreme Court of India, there is no evidence before me that the Supreme\n\nCourt will grant a divorce as opposed to sending the case back to the District Court to\n\ndeal with.38.    Cheshire and North’s Private International Law, Thirteenth\n\nEdition 1999, states at p 347:‘(iii) Multiplicity of proceedingsIf litigation involving the same parties and the same issues is\n\n  continuing simultaneously in two different countries, this is referred to as a case oflis\n\n  alibi pendens. In such cases the issue facing the English courts is not simply that of\n\n  deciding to which of the alternative fora the claimant should have to go to bring his\n\n  action. Instead, the choice is between, on the one hand, trial in Englandplustrial abroad (if a stay is refused) and, on the other hand, trial abroad (if a stay is\n\n  granted). It is very undesirable to have concurrent actions in England and abroad: this\n\n  involves more expense and inconvenience to the parties than if trial were held in merely\n\n  one country; it can also lead to two conflicting judgments, with an unseemly race by the\n\n  parties to be the first to obtain a judgment and to subsequent problems of estoppel.’39.    At p 349:‘A stay will also be refused if there is no country which is a\n\n  natural forum for trial, even if this will mean a multiplicity of proceedings. ….The weight to be attached to the factor of multiplicity of proceedings\n\n  will depend on the circumstances of the case. It is not a decisive factor in the sense of\n\n  automatically making a foreign forum clearly more appropriate and shifting the burden of\n\n  proof to the claimant to justify trial in England.’40.    In my view, existing proceedings in another jurisdiction can be a\n\ndecisive, although not an automatic, factor depending on the circumstances of the case.41.    The proceedings in India are based on C’s consent, whether\n\ngiven voluntarily or not. D is exercising his right of appeal and, indeed, he has been\n\ngranted Special Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of India. I accept Mr Thomas’\n\nargument that D’s proceedings are not in the initial stages even though he has not\n\nbeen able to proceed beyond the filing or the attempt to file the Second Petition. I also\n\nagree that the Second Petition was not filed just to show the availability of a forum\n\nother than Singapore. It seems to me that the appropriate approach is to await the outcome\n\nof the appeal to the Supreme Court of India rather than to allow C to race towards getting\n\na decision from a Singapore court that might thwart the outcome of that appeal. Even\n\nthough the success of the appeal will not in itself necessarily mean that a divorce will\n\nbe granted by the Supreme Court of India, I do not think that the doctrine oflis alibi\n\npendensshould be construed as narrowly as Mr Imran had advocated. It is sufficient if\n\nthe decision is likely to have an effect on a divorce petition filed in India in respect\n\nof the marriage of the Parties and issues arising therefrom.42.    However, I do not rest my decision on this ground alone. Even if\n\nD’s appeal is not successful, it is open to him to file a fresh petition for divorce\n\nbased not on consent but on other grounds. His lawyer has suggested that he may avail\n\nhimself of the ground of cruelty and/or desertion. Whether he will succeed is another\n\nmatter.43.    In any event, the question before me is whether there is a more\n\nappropriate forum for C to proceed in.44.    Mr Imran submitted that there was no evidence before me that the\n\ncourts in India would have jurisdiction to entertain a divorce petition by either of the\n\nParties although he accepted that there was no evidence denying such jurisdiction. I note\n\nthat the Indian lawyers for each of the Parties have given advice as to the available\n\ngrounds of divorce in India. This must pre-suppose that India has jurisdiction in the\n\nfirst place. Moreover, C’s complaint is not that India has no jurisdiction but that\n\nproceedings in India take ‘quite long and are often delayed’ and she would have\n\ndifficulty in establishing in India the adultery of D (paras 45 and 42 of her affidavit\n\nfiled on 13 January 2001). In the circumstances, India’s jurisdiction was never in\n\nissue and it was not open to Mr Imran to suggest otherwise.45.    As for proving D’s adultery, Mr Imran argued that the\n\nwitnesses relating to D’s adultery will be in Singapore as the adultery took place in\n\nSingapore and D and E are, or at least, were, resident in Singapore at the material time.\n\nI am not much swayed by this argument.46.    First, it is possible for C to commence proceedings in India for\n\na divorce by consent under Section 13-B of the Hindu Marriage Act since the Parties have\n\nsince August 2000 been living separately for more than a year. This is alluded to in an\n\nopinion from D’s lawyer in India, Mr Rajesh Yadav, in his opinion dated 30 April\n\n2001. Indeed Mr Yadav goes on to say that if C is unhappy with the settlement then she can\n\nrevive her claim even in the Indian courts. This opinion is not disputed by C’s\n\nlawyers in India.47.    Secondly, C herself has stressed that D has admitted adultery\n\nwith E in various e-mail from him. Indeed Mr Imran said that this is pervasive in the\n\ne-mail. The allegation of adultery has also been stated in her affidavits before the\n\nSingapore court and the adultery has not been denied by D in the body of his affidavits\n\nfiled in Singapore, although he has denied the adultery in his rejoinder affidavit for his\n\nappeal to the Delhi High Court. However, in an opinion dated 9 August 2001 from C’s\n\nlawyer in India, Sanjoy Ghose, he said that D has in his own appeal to the Delhi High\n\nCourt admitted to having committed adultery.48.    Mr Imran also submitted that a private investigator’s report\n\nabout the adultery will have to be obtained by C, as is usually the case in Singapore, and\n\nsuch a report will have to be obtained by a private investigator in Singapore. However,\n\nC’s divorce petition in Singapore was filed without the benefit of such a report. I\n\ninfer that she was confident that D’s e-mail to her, in addition to her allegations\n\nof what she herself had discovered and D’s alleged confession to her, were sufficient\n\nevidence and I do not see why her confidence should change if she was proceeding in India\n\ninstead.49.    Thirdly, there are the other issues such as division of property,\n\ncustody and maintenance to be dealt with.50.    These issues were supposed to have been settled. To me, India is\n\nthe most appropriate forum to determine whether C entered into the settlement voluntarily\n\nand whether the Parties have acted upon the settlement, given that the settlement was with\n\na view towards the filing of a divorce petition in India and Pranab and C are resident in\n\nIndia. Whether the settlement is unfair to C and, if unfair, whether it should still be\n\ntaken into account, should also be determined by Indian courts.51.    Even if there was no settlement, these other issues should still\n\nbe resolved by Indian courts.52.    For example, as regards division of property, Mr Imran submitted\n\nthat the monies of the Parties are controlled from Singapore at the time C’s petition\n\nwas filed here. In my view, even if the monies are controlled from Singapore, this is\n\nbecause the Parties were both residing in Singapore last before the events from July 1999.\n\nIn any event, I find this connection with Singapore tenuous. Indeed, Mr Thomas has signed\n\nan affidavit to say that he has been informed by D that D has withdrawn all monies from\n\nhis bank accounts with Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore for living expenses in India.\n\nThis is allegedly because D has left his job with the bank since 1 July 2000 and was\n\nallegedly unable to secure alternative employment in Singapore, USA or elsewhere. I\n\ndigress to say that there is no evidence as to how D came to lose his job with the bank\n\nand it was not made clear to me whether he was asked to leave or whether he initiated his\n\nown departure. If the latter, it is arguable that it was done in order to frustrate\n\nC’s claim for maintenance. It is also arguable that if indeed he has withdrawn all\n\nmonies from Standard Chartered Bank in Singapore, and he has gone to India, this was with\n\na view towards severing his connections with Singapore for the purpose of the present\n\nappeal. Be that as it may, even as at the date of C’s petition, the monies were not\n\nlocated solely in Singapore.53.    As for Mr Imran’s argument that D was working in Singapore\n\nat the time C’s petition was filed, D was not working only in Singapore during the\n\nmarriage. Also, this connection can be severed without too much difficulty and indeed it\n\nhas been severed.54.    As for the Parties’ immovable property, it is evident that\n\nthe one in London has been sold, there are still two pieces of immovable property in India\n\nand none in Singapore.55.    As regards custody of and access to the children, they are\n\nchildren of Indian citizens and are residing in India. India is the most appropriate forum\n\nto make orders in respect of them.56.    Even for maintenance, while a court may wish to consider the\n\nprevious standard of living of the family in Singapore, it may also want to consider the\n\ncost of living at the place where the mother and the children are at present residing.57.    As Lee Seiu Kin JC said inLow Wing Hong Alvin v Kelso Sharon\n\nLeigh[2001] 1 SLR 173, ‘it is more important that the same court consider and\n\ndecide these matters [meaning the divorce and ancillary matters such as custody and\n\naccess] than to divide the issues to be decided in separate courts simply because the\n\nassets are in another jurisdiction’. It also seems to me that the real reason why C\n\nhas commenced divorce proceedings in Singapore is not so much to obtain a divorce. As she\n\nherself has indicated, it is D, not her, who wanted the divorce. There is also an e-mail\n\nfrom D stating his intention to be engaged to E. In my view, C has proceeded in Singapore\n\nbecause she thinks she will get a better deal here for the division of property and\n\nmaintenance.58.    In all the circumstances, I find that India is clearly the most\n\nappropriate forum to decide on any divorce petition, whether filed by C or D, and\n\nquestions arising from or in relation to the divorce or the failed marriage such as\n\ndivision of property, custody and maintenance.59.    However, Mr Imran sought to persuade me that even if I should\n\nmake this finding, I should not order a stay otherwise C would lose legitimate personal or\n\njuridical advantages. Based on the opinion from C’s lawyer, Indira Jaising, dated 7\n\nApril 2001, these are:(a) Proceedings in Singapore will be heard faster than in India(b) Indian law does not recognise a wife’s contribution as a\n\n  homemaker and does not provide for equal division of matrimonial assets.(c) Orders of Indian courts in respect of properties and assets outside\n\n  India cannot be enforced outside India.60.    I note that the proceedings in India in respect of D’s\n\nappeal to the Delhi High Court and for Special Leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of\n\nIndia have not been unduly slow. Even if, for the sake of argument, divorce proceedings\n\nwill be dealt with more slowly than in Singapore, this is not sufficient to me to avoid a\n\nstay. Likewise, even if Indian law does not recognise a wife’s contribution as a\n\nhomemaker. Otherwise, so long as the Singapore courts have jurisdiction, there will be a\n\ngravitation of matrimonial proceedings from a more appropriate foreign forum to the\n\nSingapore courts so that the petitioner can get a quicker hearing and a better deal. I\n\nwill add that Singapore law does not provide for equal division of matrimonial assets as\n\nsuch. It all depends on the facts.61.    As for the enforcement of an Indian court order, this can be\n\nenforced directly in Singapore (if there are still monies here) by registration of the\n\norder if it relates to the payment of a sum of money and emanates from a superior court in\n\nIndia or by the commencement of fresh proceedings in Singapore. Such a step does not\n\nresult in duplicity or multiplicity of proceedings, as such, as Mr Imran was suggesting.\n\nIt is not a sufficient reason to refuse a stay.62.    At this point, I digress briefly to say that I was informed by Mr\n\nThomas that D has stopped making any maintenance payment pending his appeal to the Supreme\n\nCourt of India. In my view, this does not reflect well on him. If, as he maintains, the\n\nsettlement is binding on the Parties, then he should be acting consistently with his own\n\nposition and not that of C’s. This is all the more so when his own lawyer, N K\n\nKashyap, has opined on 1 March 2002 that the Delhi High Court has ‘decided and\n\nsettled the issue of interim maintenance pending the outcome of the appeal to the Supreme\n\nCourt’ (see also Mr Kashyap’s opinion dated 25 March 2002 which is to the same\n\neffect, ‘The orders on maintenance were made …’). On the other hand, C has\n\ntaken the position that no such order for interim maintenance was made by the Delhi High\n\nCourt. Whatever the true position, it is for her to seek such redress as she may be\n\nadvised but not by way of the divorce petition or Summons-in-Chambers No 650813 of 2001 in\n\nSingapore.63.    As for a suggestion that much work has already been done in\n\nSingapore, I am of the view that such work was primarily in relation to D’s\n\napplication in Singapore for a dismissal or a stay and therefore cannot be a factor in\n\navoiding a stay.64.    In all the circumstances, I allow the appeal and order a stay of\n\nall proceedings in Divorce Petition No 2792 of 2000 including Summons-in-Chambers No\n\n650813 of 2001.65.    I will hear the parties on costs.Sgd:WOO BIH LIJUDICIAL COMMISSIONERCopyright © Government of Singapore."
