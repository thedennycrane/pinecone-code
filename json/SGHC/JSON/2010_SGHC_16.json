Counsel for AMP\n                    confirmed that AMP was not relying on s 8(3) TMA. 6       After hearing the parties’ oral\n                    submissions and considering their written submissions, I reversed the decision\n                    of the PAR and allowed Ozone’s Trade Mark Application No T02/03173J for\n                    the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 to proceed to\n                    registration (see[1]above). I now give the\n                    reasons for my decision.

[AMP\n                            states] that the first issue of GLAMOUR magazine had been published more\n                            than 60 years ago in May 1941. Since then [AMP states] that the GLAMOUR\n                            magazine has been devoted to the reporting and portraying [of], among\n                            other things, women’s fashion, beauty, careers, relationships,\n                            sex/health, women’s issues, travel, food, home decorating, cars,\n                            audio, film and more, all directed towards the contemporary working\n                            woman.12    [AMP states] that [it has] secured registrations or\n                            [has] pending registrations of the GLAMOUR mark in more than 100\n                            countries. There are some copies of some of the Certificates of\n                            Registration attached to the statutory declaration. There is also a\n                            table listing the countries in which the GLAMOUR mark has been\n                            registered or is pending registration. It should be noted that the\n                            number of Certificates of Registration do not match the number of\n                            countries where the GLAMOUR mark is listed as registered. I note that\n                            [AMP has] made assertions that sought to prove that [AMP has] worldwide\n                            reputation. However, to support such an important fact, [it has] only\n                            submitted sample copies of the Certificates of Registration in the\n                            various countries where [it] had claimed the reputation exists. The list\n                            of countries includes 94 countries, whereas the exhibits to the\n                            statutory declaration only show copies of Certificates of Registration\n                            from 43 countries. This is only as far as I can tell; the next issue\n                            that I have with the evidence is that most of it comes without a\n                            certified translation. Since the certificates come from all over the\n                            world, I am presented with a vast array of languages that I am afraid I\n                            do not have the faculty to master. Where this is the case, the\n                            Certificate of Registration shall do nothing more to substantiate the\n                            assertions of [AMP] than if there was no copy submitted at all. It is\n                            truly a pity that, for a fact that is as crucial as the completeness of\n                            the worldwide reputation, there is only partial substantiation of the\n                            assertions of [AMP]. That is not to say that the statement by Mr.\n                            Bellando is of no weight; it was made under oath and the penalties of\n                            being found to be untruthful while under oath strongly discourage any\n                            untruthful statements. However, the case for the worldwide reputation\n                            could have been made much stronger had all the Certificates of\n                            Registration been presented, and accompanied by the certified\n                            translation of the certificate. I have some understanding of the\n                            difficulty that counsel faces when asking for and obtaining this\n                            information, but parties who present a bare statement of worldwide\n                            reputation without anything more will risk facing significant challenges\n                            on their statement, or at least and have their statements bear much less\n                            weight.13    [AMP states] that [its] GLAMOUR magazine is sold\n                            and distributed in many countries worldwide. The total global\n                            circulation has amounted to at least 2,376,096 copies per month (based\n                            on the average circulation figure for September 2002). [AMP tenders]\n                            into evidence a table of countries where the GLAMOUR magazine is\n                            presently distributed and sold.14    In terms of domestic sales, [AMP states] that [it]\n                            first commenced use of the GLAMOUR mark from at least as early as\n                            September 1984.

The magazine also outsells more than 98% of\n                            all magazines on the newsstands. The GLAMOUR mark is also world famous\n                            by way of the GLAMOUR websites that are accessible worldwide. By virtue\n                            of this extremely substantial and extensive use of the GLAMOUR mark, the\n                            mark has become distinctive of the Opponents both in Singapore and\n                            globally.16    There were no advertising and promotion figures\n                            submitted into evidence.17    [AMP] did not tender a second statutory\n                            declaration.Facts pertaining to Ozone8       With respect to Ozone, the following background\n                    facts were set out at [18]–[23] of the GD:[Ozone’s] Evidence18    [Ozone’s] evidence comes by way of a\n                            statutory declaration declared in Japan on\n                                5thDecember 2006 by Mr Noriyuki\n                            Yamagani.

[Ozone is] the registered [proprietor] of the trade mark HYSTERIC\n                            GLAMOUR in Japan, United Kingdom, United State[s] of America, Hong Kong,\n                            Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea.

In particular,\n                            [Ozone refers] to the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark in the UK in Class 16\n                            covering“Paper and cardboard; industrial\n                                packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of\n                                paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns;\n                                tailor’s chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;\n                                banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter;\n                                paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;\n                                playing cards; stationery and study materials”.\n                            [Ozone highlights] that this Class 16 mark co-exists on the UK\n                            register with [AMP’s] GLAMOUR mark in the UK. [emphasis in\n                            original]20    [Ozone] had invented the mark HYSTERIC GLAMOUR for\n                            use in connection with fashion apparel. [Ozone] had subsequently used\n                            the mark in Japan since 1984 on clothing, bags, footwear and fashion\n                            accessories. [Ozone] tendered evidence of advertisements in Japanese\n                            magazines as well as extracts from [its] company website as evidence of\n                            the fashion style of the products sold.21    [Ozone asserts] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has\n                            become extremely famous as a fashion clothes label in Japan. [Ozone\n                            submits] that a travel listing in the website Yahoo! Travel Listing as\n                            well as the list of HYSTERIC GLAMOUR retail stores located throughout\n                            Japan point to a significant reputation built by [Ozone] since\n                            1984.22    [Ozone claims] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has\n                            in recent years gained a business presence in countries apart from\n                            Japan. HYSTERIC GLAMOUR stores have been set up in Hong Kong and in the\n                            United States of America. [Ozone asserts] that [it has] two stores in\n                            Hong Kong and 25 stores in the US. I note that, on a careful examination\n                            of the exhibits before me, that the stores that [Ozone claims] are the\n                            stores outside of Japan, are actually more likely to be stores belonging\n                            to other franchises that merely carry HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                        goods.23    [Ozone’s] goods bearing the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                            mark have yet to be sold or advertised in Singapore. There are no\n                            figures pertaining to sales and advertisements in\n                        Singapore.The decision of the PAR9       As ss 8(2)(b)\n                    and 8(4) TMA were raised in this appeal before me (see[5]above), I shall set out the PAR’s findingsvis-à-visthese two sections only.The PAR’s findings with respect to s 8(2)(b) TMA10     Section 8(2)(b) TMA states:Relative grounds for refusal of\n                        registration8. —(1)…(2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because\n                        —…(b) it is similar to an earlier\n                        trade mark and is to be registered for goods or services identical\n                        with or similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is\n                        protected,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                        public.11     With respect to AMP’s opposition under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA, the PAR observed (at [62]\n                    of the GD) that AMP had the burden of proving that the following criteria were\n                    satisfied:(a)     that AMP had earlier trade mark\n                        registrations as defined in s 2 TMA;(b)     that Ozone’s mark (viz, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s\n                        earlier trade marks (viz,\n                        “GLAMOUR”) were similar;(c)     that the goods of Ozone’s mark (viz, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s\n                        earlier trade marks (viz,\n                        “GLAMOUR”) were identical or similar; and(d)     there was a likelihood of confusion by\n                        virtue of the similarity of the marks and the goods.12     The several earlier trade mark registrations\n                    in favour of AMP (see[2]above) were not\n                    disputed by Ozone (see [64] of the GD). The PAR considered whether Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA. As correctly noted by the PAR, there are three\n                    aspects to similarity,viz, visual similarity,\n                    aural or phonetic similarity, and conceptual similarity.Similarity of marks(1)   Visual similarity13     The PAR found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were visuallydissimilaron a simple visual\n                    analysis and that there was no dominant element in either of the word\n                    marks:68    I have been assaulted [sic] with diametrically opposed arguments on which\n                            element is the dominant element. But while [AMP tried] valiantly to\n                            deflect attention from the visual aspects by advancing [its] argument\n                            that the dominant element is GLAMOUR, and [AMP] advance[d] equally\n                            trying arguments that the element HYSTERIC is not overshadowed, the\n                            simple analysis in visual similarity is merely to look at the marks. In\n                            this case, there are many visual differences between the marks. The\n                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the\n                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one. I do not\n                            think that the language represented by the letters is so unusual or\n                            descriptive that there should be any dominant element. I am of the\n                            opinion that the marks are visually dissimilar. …(2)   Aural or phonetic similarity14     The PAR also found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were aurallydissimilar:69    I still cannot help but find that a simple analysis\n                            is all that is required of the test of aural similarity. The simple\n                            analysis here is that the complete sound of [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark\n                            is different from [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark. The simple\n                            facts are that [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark is made up of five\n                            readable syllables in two words with a pause in between, whereas\n                            [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark is two syllables in one word. Three of the\n                            syllables in [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark are not duplicated as\n                            sounds in [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark. This basic analysis shows that\n                            there is a fair bit of dissimilarity between the two marks in terms of\n                            syntax. The question is whether the repetition of two common syllables\n                            that form a common word ‘glamour’ will cause these two\n                            marks, as a whole, to be considered as aurally similar. My answer is no,\n                            and here again I do not think that [Matratzen Concord\n                                GMBH v OHIM, Case T-6/01, Judgment of the Court of First Instance\n                                (fourth Chamber)] can apply to swing the decision the\n                            other way. The case of Matratzen decided (at para XLIII) that, as\n                            between the elements ‘Matratzen’ and ‘Concord’,\n                            the element Matratzen was an invented word with hard to pronounce\n                            consonants and appeared more likely to be remembered by the public. I do\n                            not have this distinction before me in the present case, I only have\n                            before me the words HYSTERIC and GLAMOUR, and I am hard pressed to say\n                            that one is more pronounceable than the other so much so that the public\n                            is more likely to remember it. Consequently, and bearing in mind my\n                            earlier basic analysis of the two marks, I am of the opinion that the\n                            marks are aurally dissimilar.(3)   Conceptual similarity15     Having found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were visuallyandaurallydissimilar, the PAR then found that the words marks were however\n                    conceptuallysimilar:70    The area of conceptual similarity is the hardest\n                            element to determine in this case. The [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR]\n                            mark and [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark both bear the word GLAMOUR. The crux\n                            of the decision lies in whether the word GLAMOUR has been modified by\n                            the term HYSTERIC. I note the arguments from both sides relating to the\n                                [sic] whether I should treat the word\n                            HYSTERIC as distinctive or laudatory. I am of the opinion that the word\n                            HYSTERIC does not modify the word GLAMOUR in a similar way as\n                            the…case [inItochu Corporation v Worldwide\n                                Brands Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9]. The word HYSTERIC does\n                            modify the concept of GLAMOUR in a way that is described by [Ozone at\n                            [51] above] to a certain point. However, the main concept is still\n                            ‘glamour’. The concept has not been completely reversed, as\n                            it has been in [Itochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands\n                                Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9], where the ruggedness of the Camel\n                            concept was essentially reversed by the addition of the prefix\n                            ‘sweet’. In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark still\n                            relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’, albeit\n                            injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically glamorous’.\n                            From another point of view this should still hold true; [Ozone’s\n                            concept] cannot be that the clothes do not look glamorous at all,\n                            otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their mark, which is to sell\n                            designed clothes at a premium price.71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is\n                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use\n                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to [the] orthodox\n                            meaning of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it\n                            but still is based on ‘glamour’. ...16     On the basis of such conceptual similarityalone, the PAR concluded that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark, though visually and aurally dissimilar, were nevertheless\n                    “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA. The PAR then proceeded to consider whether the goods\n                    bearing Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were “similar”.Similarity of goods17     The PAR found that there was similarity in\n                    respect ofonlythe Class 16 goods specified\n                    by Ozone (ie, Ozone’s goods: see[1]above) and AMP (ie, AMP’s goods: see[2]above):73    … In relation to [AMP’s] goods in\n                            Classes 9, 35, 41 and 42, there is no similarity in terms of the\n                            goods. In relation to [AMP’s] Class 16 goods, [Ozone]\n                            conceded that there may be an overlap with the goods that they are\n                            applying for. Even without this concession, it is clear to me that the\n                            scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (“Magazines, books and publications”) is\n                            clearly a sub-set of [Ozone’s goods](in particular the mention of“printed matter”in\n                            the description of [Ozone’s] goods). There does not seem to be a\n                            need to decide along the lines of the…factors [set out inBritish Sugar PLC v James Robertson & Sons\n                                Ltd[1996] RPC 281]. [emphasis in original]Likelihood of confusion18     The PAR then considered whether there was a\n                    likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in respect of AMP’s and\n                    Ozone’s Class 16 goods. He noted at [74] of the GD, referring to [66]\n                    of the Court of Appeal’s decision inMcDonald’s\n                        Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR 177\n                        (“McDonald’s (CA)”)\n                    that:The lack of similarity as between the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark and the\n                        GLAMOUR mark is only one factor in the determination of the likelihood of\n                        confusion, since the element of likelihood of confusion takes into account a\n                        lot more than just the similarity of marks and of the goods. …19     Following that, the PAR identified the\n                    relevant segment of the public to be “the entire group of women who read\n                    magazines for leisure and [who] are fashion conscious”. As Ozone had\n                    “not submitted very much on the intended use of the goods other than the\n                    specifications” (see [76] of the GD), the PAR considered notional use by\n                    Ozone of the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in assessing the likelihood\n                    of confusion. In this aspect, the PAR noted that given the similarity of goods\n                    (see[17]above) and because it was\n                    “reasonable to speculate” (since Ozone had not submitted any\n                    evidence of the actual or intended use of its goods) that any use by Ozone of\n                    the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark would not fall far from their core\n                    business of “design and retailing of fashion apparel and accessories for\n                    both men and women”, this “may result in a situation where both\n                    the marks will be used on similar goods”. The PAR rejected AMP’s\n                    submission that the public would see Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” mark as a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark purely by the application of the conceptually\n                    similar marks onto similar goods and was of the view that there was no\n                    calculated attempt to deceive because Ozone’s and AMP’s\n                    “advertising retain their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy\n                    each other’s style” (see [78] of the GD). Nevertheless, the PAR\n                    concluded at [79] of the GD:79    Having considered all the above factors, I believe\n                            that there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant\n                            public, in this case the members of the public who are female who read\n                            magazines for leisure and are fashion conscious. Although there are some\n                            differences between the [AMP’s “GLAMOUR”] mark and\n                            [Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”] mark in terms of visual\n                            and aural similarity, there are similarities in concept. This similarity\n                            could give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the relevant segment of\n                            the public if the marks were affixed on similar goods, especially since\n                            [Ozone’s and AMP’s businesses] overlap. Where this is the\n                            case, this ground of opposition will succeed as all the essential\n                            elements of Section 8(2) [TMA] are made out.The PAR’s findings with respect to passing off under\n                s 8(4) TMA20     Section 8(4) TMA states:(4) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent\n                        that, its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented —(a) by virtue of any rule of law (in\n                        particular, the law of passing off) protecting an unregistered trade mark\n                        or other sign used in the course of trade; or(b) by virtue of an earlier right\n                        other than those referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (3) or\n                            paragraph (a), in particular by\n                        virtue of the law of copyright or any law with regard to the protection\n                        of designs.21     Under this section, the PAR first observed, at\n                    [96] of the GD, that to succeed in an action for passing off under s 8(4)\n                    TMA, AMP had to satisfy three criteria,viz,\n                    that:(a)     AMP’s goods and services had\n                        acquired a goodwill or reputation in the market and are known by some\n                        distinguishing feature;(b)     there was a misrepresentation by Ozone (whether or not\n                        intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or\n                        services offered by Ozone were goods or services of AMP;\n                    and(c)     AMP had\n                        suffered or was likely to suffer damage as a result of the erroneous belief\n                        engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation.Goodwill or reputation22     With regard to the first element of goodwill\n                    or reputation, the PAR observed that although AMP claimed that its use of the\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started from 1984, apart from a table\n                    and random invoices that did not date beyond the year 2000, there was no\n                    “good evidence” that AMP’s magazine started selling in\n                    Singapore from 1984. The PAR also noted that the highest circulation of\n                    AMP’s magazine at 903 copies in Singapore was unimpressive and was a\n                    “number that [was] disproportionately low for the population of Singapore\n                    that [was] around 3 million at that time” (see [88] of the GD). The PAR\n                    then concluded that the circulation numbers however indicated that AMP had\n                    “some goodwill and reputation in Singapore”. Since the further\n                    point as to whether the goodwill rested in AMP or the distributor of its\n                    magazine was not argued before the PAR, he concluded that the goodwill should\n                    belong to AMP in the absence of any challenge (see [98] of the\n                GD).Misrepresentation23     On misrepresentation, the PAR noted that the\n                    mere fact that a likelihood of confusion was found under s 8(2) TMA (see[18]–[19]above) did not automatically lead to the finding that there\n                    would be misrepresentation under passing off (see [99] of the GD); the element\n                    of misrepresentation “require[d] more than just a likelihood of confusion\n                    in the sense understood under trade mark law” (see [100] of the GD).\n                    Relying on his earlier observation (see[19]above) that there was no evidence that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” mark was a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark and that Ozone’s and AMP’s advertising\n                    retained their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy each other’s\n                    style, the PAR concluded that:101    … This evidence also goes to show that\n                            there is clearly no misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt [by\n                            Ozone to try] to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                            goods.Damage24     Having found that the second criteria of\n                    “misrepresentation” was not made out (see[23]above), the PAR then considered it “natural that\n                    there cannot be any case to damage that has occurred or that is likely to\n                    occur” (see [102] of the GD). However, the PAR also considered the\n                    alternative position where “confusing similarity” under\n                    s 8(2) TMA may be seen as a misrepresentation. In this aspect, he noted\n                    that he was unconvinced by AMP’s argument that its magazine was a\n                    “class publication” to prove damage:103    … I am unconvinced that the mere mention\n                            [of or] association with [Ozone’s business] will bring about the\n                            ‘devastating’ damage that [AMP claims] will happen. The use\n                            of tattooed individuals and of vulgar words on a T-shirt design that\n                            will appear on the pages or cover of another magazine is too remote a\n                            cause that can be linked to the damage in the goodwill of [AMP’s]\n                            GLAMOUR magazine.104    Further, I would think that advertisers are only\n                            likely to leave the magazine if the magazine itself is falling from\n                            being a ‘class publication’, and that is only if the\n                            magazine carrying the advertisements themselves are actively carrying\n                            out actions (to use the quoted examples, using heavily tattooed models\n                            and vulgar words) that will cause the magazine to be seen as a\n                            publication that is not a class publication. To say that advertisers\n                            will remove advertisements from one magazine because of the association\n                            of that one magazine with another offending publication, or because of\n                            the association of that one magazine with an offending entity is a\n                            tenuous argument, especially since the advertisers’ advertisement\n                            does not come anywhere near the offending publication.105    In any event, I note that the ‘class\n                            publication’ principle originated from [AMP’s] own\n                            literature. There are also no other proofs of damage that were tendered\n                            before me.25     Accordingly, the PAR concluded that because\n                    the elements of passing off were not made out, AMP’s ground of opposition\n                    under s 8(4) TMA failed.26     Having set out the grounds for the PAR’s\n                    decision, I now proceed to summarise the parties’ main contentions in the\n                    appeal before me (see[27]–[28]below), before elaborating further on the\n                    parties’ arguments in my decision below.Ozone’s arguments on appeal27     Ozone raised five arguments to contend that\n                    the PAR had erred in holding that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was\n                    “confusingly similar” to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark pursuant to s 8(2)(b) TMA (see[10]–[19]above),viz, that the PAR had\n                    erred in:(a)     finding that its “HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” mark was conceptually similar to Ozone’s\n                        “GLAMOUR” mark (see[15]above);(b)     finding\n                        that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was “similar”\n                        to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR” mark on the basis of conceptual\n                        similarityalone;(c)     not considering the lack of distinctiveness of\n                        AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR” mark (see[64]below);(d)     finding that Ozone’s goods,excluding“printed matter” (viz, “paper and cardboard; industrial\n                        packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of paper; hand\n                        towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’\n                        chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners of paper; flags of\n                        paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic works; photographs,\n                        photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study materials”)\n                        were similar to AMP’s goods (viz,\n                        “magazines books and publications”) ( see[17]above); and(e)     finding that there was a likelihood of confusion\n                        between its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s\n                        “GLAMOUR” word mark (see[18]–[19]above).AMP’s arguments on appeal28     On its end, AMP submitted that the PAR had not\n                    erred except in three respects,viz, that the PAR\n                    had erred in holding that:(a)     its “GLAMOUR” mark was\n                        notvisuallysimilar to Ozone’s\n                        ”HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark (see[13]above);(b)     its “GLAMOUR” word mark was notaurallysimilar to Ozone’s ”HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” word mark (see[14]above); and(c)     the\n                        law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the\n                        “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA (see[20]–[25]above).The decision of this court29     As stated above at[5], the parties’ contentions before me related only to\n                    the PAR’s decision on the applicability of ss 8(2)(b) and 8(4) TMA. Before elaborating on the law and the\n                    parties’ respective arguments, it would be useful to first examine the\n                    standard of review applicable in the present proceedings.The role of an appellate tribunal30     InFuture Enterprises Pte\n                        Ltd v McDonald’s Corp[2007] 2 SLR 845\n                        (“Future Enterprises”), the\n                    Court of Appeal was of the view that appeals from a decision of the PAR\n                    “are not in the nature of a rehearing” and the PAR’s\n                    findings of fact should be disturbed only where there is a “material\n                    error in principle”,ie, a\n                    “significant departure from a proper assessment of the law or the\n                    facts” (see [5]–[7] ofFuture\n                        Enterprises):5    … having\n                            regard to the general principles applicable to appeals against findings\n                            of fact in trade mark applications, we see no reason why we should\n                            disturb the dual findings of fact by the PAR and the trial judge of\n                            similarity and likelihood of confusion between the two word marks\n                            “MacCoffee” and “McCAFÉ”. InReef Trade Mark[2003] RPC 5, Robert\n                            Walker LJ considered the function of an appellate tribunal in\n                            relation to appeals from the UK Trade Mark Registry, and concluded (at\n                            [28]) that“an appellate court should …\n                                show a real reluctance, but not the very highest degree of\n                                reluctance, to interfere in the absence of a distinct and material\n                                error of principle”.

An appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal is\n                            similarly by way of rehearing under O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC.\n                            However, the Court of Appeal will be slow to upset an exercise of\n                            discretion by the trial judge (Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO\n                            Bank [2004] 1 SLR 6 at [44]). Further, with respect to finding\n                            of facts, the Court of Appeal is generally reluctant to interfere\n                            because the trial judge is in a better position to assess the veracity\n                            and credibility of the witnesses (Seah Ting Soon trading as Sing Meng Co\n                            Wooden Cases Factory v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd [2001]\n                            1 SLR 521 at [22]).On the other hand, a\n                                distinction is drawn between perception of facts and evaluation of\n                                facts, the latter of which an appellate court is in as good a\n                                position as the trial court to make an evaluation from primary\n                                facts(Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank [2007]\n                            2 SLR 181 at [20]).However the authorities\n                                are clear that the law pertaining to trade mark infringement is\n                                unique in that the final analysis is “more a matter of feel\n                                than science”(Future Enterprises at\n                        [7]).27Be that as it may, in view of the findings that I\n                            have made as set out below, it does not make a difference whether or not\n                            the appeal is to be by way of a rehearing. As mentioned\n                        earlier, MediaCorp proceeded only on two grounds in this appeal, viz\n                        ss 8(2)(b) and 8(3) [TMA], which I now turn to consider.[emphasis added]34     O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC was also\n                    covered by Chan Seng Onn J inValentino Globe BV v\n                        Pacific Rim Industries Inc[2009] 4 SLR 577 (which was\n                    subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 46 of 2009)\n                    although neitherFuture EnterprisesnorMediaCorpwas mentioned. Chan J said:9    Order 87\n                            rule 4(2) of the [ROC] provides that an appeal from the Registrar\n                            of Trade Marks shall be by way of “rehearing”. At\n                            para 87/3/7 of Singapore Civil Procedure 2007 (Sweet & Maxwell\n                            Asia, 2007 ) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”), it iterates\n                            that appeals to the court from the decision of the registrar [of trade\n                            marks] is governed inter alia, by O 55 and that the procedure is\n                            “by way of\n                            rehearing…”.10    On\n                            O 55 which governs appeals to the High Court from any court,\n                            tribunal or person, para 55/1/2 of Singapore Civil Procedure notes\n                            that O 55 r 2(1) stipulates that the appeal is by way of rehearing.\n                            Order 55, it suggests, confers upon the Court wider powers than those so\n                            conferred under O 53 which deals with, inter alia, judicial review.\n                            Hence, O 55 r 6(5) provides that the appellate court can make\n                            any order which should have been made by the tribunal. The appellate\n                            court is thus not confined to merely determining whether the decision\n                            below was compliant with rules of natural justice or reached honestly\n                            (Ling Uk Choon v Public Accountants Board [2004] 3 SLR 517 at\n                            [32]).11    “By way of\n                            rehearing” in my view means that the Court is not constrained to\n                            determine only whether the tribunal’s decision was proper and/or\n                            contained manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the Court in\n                            its discretion may consider the entire ream of evidence before it and\n                            venture beyond determining the propriety of the tribunal’s\n                            decision or inquiring into whether there had been manifest errors of\n                            fact or law. However, I do not think that it places an irrevocable\n                            burden upon the Courts to hear the matter anew so that the substantive\n                            merits fall to be determined afresh. As para 57/3/1 of Singapore\n                            Civil Procedure observes with regard to the phrase “by way of\n                            rehearing”, albeit in relation to appeals to the Court of\n                            Appeal:These words do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They\n                            indicate the appeal is not limited to a consideration whether the\n                            misdirection, misreception of evidence or other alleged defect in the\n                            trial has taken place, so that a new trial should be ordered. They\n                            indicate that the court considers (so far as may be relevant) the whole\n                            of the evidence given in the court below and the whole course of the\n                            trial.…The courts’ power is therefore discretionary.[emphasis in original]35     Be that as it may, as inMediaCorp, in view of my findings as set out below, it would\n                    make no difference whether or not the appeal is to be by way of a rehearing. I\n                    now turn to examine the two grounds raised in this appeal,viz, ss 8(2)(b) and 8(4)\n                    TMA.AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) TMA36     To successfully oppose Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA, AMP must show that the following three conditions are\n                    satisfied in a “step-by-step” fashion (see the Court of\n                    Appeal’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In\n                        Department Store Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR 690\n                        (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                    (CA)”):(a)     that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR”\n                        word mark are similar (“Condition 1”);(b)ifCondition 1 is satisfied,thenthat\n                        Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark is to be registered\n                        for goods identical with or similar to those for which AMP’s earlier\n                        “GLAMOUR” word mark is protected (\n                        “Condition 2”); and(c)ifCondition 1andCondition 2 arebothsatisfied,thenthat there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by\n                        virtue of the similarity of the marks (ie,\n                        Condition 1) and of the goods (ie,\n                        Condition 2) (“Condition 3”).37     With respect to these three conditions, the\n                    following observations at [8] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)are instructive:8    … While we can see some link and overlap\n                            between the first and the third conditions, it is clear that they are\n                            different. The fact that a sign is similar to a registered mark does not\n                            automatically mean that there will be a likelihood of confusion on the\n                            part of the public. That is a question of fact to be determined by the\n                            court, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Moreover, the\n                            question of similarity is really a matter of degree. In a broad sort of\n                            sense, the greater the similarity between a mark and a sign, the greater\n                            will be the likelihood of confusion.However, if\n                                either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not\n                                be any need to go into the third question of determining whether\n                                there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean that if\n                                the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                                goods, that there will ipso facto be confusion in the minds of the\n                                public. If that was intended, s 27(2)(b) [see [15] ofThe\n                                Polo/Lauren Co (CA)where it was held that this approach\n                            also applied to s 8(2)(b) TMA] would\n                            have been phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.\n                            … [emphasis added]38     I now proceed to consider these respective\n                    conditions against the facts of this case in accordance with this\n                    framework.Condition 1: Similarity between the “HYSTERIC\n                GLAMOUR” and “GLAMOUR” word marks39     At the outset, it must be borne in mind that\n                    the word marks compared in this appeal were devoid of any stylisation,\n                    embellishment or device, and were as follows:Ozone’s word\n                                    markAMP’s word markHYSTERIC\n                                        GLAMOURGLAMOUR(1)   The approach to be adopted(A)   VISUAL, AURAL AND CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY40     As mentioned at[12]above, there are three aspects to similarity,viz, visual similarity, aural or phonetic similarity and\n                    conceptual similarity (seeThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [10]). Whether there is a similarity of marks in these three aspects of\n                    similarity is essentially a question of fact (seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR 1082 (“Johnson &\n                        Johnson”) at [9]). The law doesnothowever requireallthree\n                    similarities to be made out before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediaCorpat [32]). In this\n                    aspect, the observations of Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed,\n                    2009) (“Bently & Sherman”) at\n                    pp 863-866 are also apposite (footnotes omitted):Visual, aural and conceptual similarity. The\n                        marks should be assessed from the point of view of their visual, aural and\n                        conceptual similarities. Typically, tribunals consider\n                            each in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they\n                            have observed that a trade-off can occur: visual and conceptual\n                            differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities.…The relative importance of each sort of similarity will vary with the\n                        circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark.\n                        … Each case is therefore to be viewed in its own context. However,\n                        the ECJ has ruled [inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen\n                            Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2CMLR1343] that,in an appropriate\n                            case, mere aural similarity may make marks so similar as to be likely to\n                            cause confusion……In other situations, conceptual dissimilarity, as for\n                            example where one mark has a meaning but its comparator does not, may\n                            counteract aural or visual similarity.[emphasis added]41     A useful case in point is that ofMystery Drinks GmbH v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal\n                        Market (Trade Marks and Designs), Karlsberg Brauerei KG Weber\n                        Intervening[2004] ETMR 217 (which was cited with approval inJohnson & Johnsonat [13]), where\n                    “Mystery” was refused registration for non-alcoholic drinks as the\n                    mark “Mixery” had already been registered for beer. The learned\n                    authors ofBently & Shermannote at footnote\n                    51, pp 864-865 that although the:… figurative mark MYSTERY with stylized M and MIXERY wereneither conceptually nor visually similar, butwere aurally similar…in the field of beverages\n                            this was sufficient. [emphasis added]42     Accordingly, the relative importance of each\n                    type of similarity will thus vary with the circumstances in hand, in particular\n                    the goods and the types of mark. The fact that one type of similarity is made\n                    out doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. Also, regard should be had to thetypeof\n                    marks being compared (seeMediaCorpat\n                    [32]).(B)   DISTINCTIVENESS43     The distinctiveness in the earlier trade mark\n                        (ie, “GLAMOUR” in this case) is\n                    also one important factor in the inquiry into the similarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. In this vein, Ng-Loy Wee\n                    Loon inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singapore(Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2009) (“Law of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singapore”) observes as follows (footnotes\n                    omitted):Comparison between marks…[21.5.12]The distinctiveness in the earlier\n                        trade mark is one important factor.Where a common word\n                            is included in the earlier trade mark, the tribunal should be wary of\n                            granting a monopoly in its use. This translates into a reluctance to\n                            hold that two marks which contain a common word are similar\n                            marks.[emphasis added]44     The learned authors ofBently & Shermannote further at pp 866-868 (footnotes\n                    omitted):Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effectsFirst,the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the\n                            less literal or visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later\n                            mark is not similar. For example, the CFI comparing two words\n                        CASTELLANI and CASTERLLUCA for wine from the point of view of a German\n                        consumer found the two marks to be dissimilar, because the\n                        ‘castel’ element is a common descriptive component in wine names\n                        and the applicant’s suffix ‘luca’ would be seen as the\n                        Italian name and thus sufficient to differentiate the marks. InReed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ stated that‘where\n                            a mark is descriptive small differences may suffice to avoid\n                            confusion’, giving an illustration from the law of\n                        passing-off concerning the terms OFFICE CLEANING ASSOCIATION and OFFICE\n                        CLEANING SERVICES.Where the distinctiveness of the\n                            earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will have to be in close\n                            proximity for it to be similar, as with THERMAWEAR and\n                        THERMAWARM.The same principle applies to common names\n                            which intrinsically have a low level of\n                        distinctiveness.Second, if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then a mark that has\n                        been substantially modified might nonetheless still be similar.\n                        …[emphasis added]45     That this is the approach adopted in Singapore\n                    case-law can be seen from the High Court’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005]\n                    4 SLR 816 (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC)”):The similarity between the plaintiff’s marks and\n                            the defendant’s sign26    The decided cases suggest that there are three\n                            aspects to similarity: visual, aural or phonetic, and conceptual. In\n                            terms of visual similarity, it is clear that the mark and the sign share\n                            one common denominator: the word “POLO”.In cases where there is a common denominator, it is\n                                important to look at the differences between the mark and the sign\n                                in order to decide whether the challenged sign has been able to\n                                distinguish itself sufficiently and substantially:The European Limited v The Economist Newspapers\n                                Limited[1996] FSR 431 at 436; see alsoKerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names(Sweet & Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2001) at paras 16-63 to\n                            16-67...In other words, sometimes, looking at the\n                                challenged sign as a whole, the distinctiveness of the registered\n                                word mark is dissolved by the addition of the word. Accordingly, the\n                                similarity between the mark and the sign is significantly\n                                diminishedand may be insufficient to cause a likelihood\n                            of confusion.27In the present case, the\n                                differences are obvious: the addition of the word\n                                “PACIFIC” together with the sign’s different\n                                font and design. The question, then, is whether these differences\n                                are enough so as not to capture the distinctiveness of the\n                                registered mark. In order to decide this, I first have to consider\n                                whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to be so\n                                distinctive that the differences would not negate the\n                                similarity. This is an important issue because a more\n                            distinct mark generally receives greater protection:Premier Brands UK Ltd v Typhoon Europe Ltd[2000] FSR\n                            767 (“Premier Brands”).\n                            …28    …[I] am prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s\n                                word mark is somewhat distinctive but not strikingly so. As such,\n                                the differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the\n                                defendant’s sign are sufficient so that the latter does not\n                                capture the distinctiveness of the registered mark and is therefore\n                                not similar to the defendant’s mark.\n                            …[emphasis added]46     While the italicised words in [26] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(reproduced above at[45]) seem to suggest that the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into thelikelihood of confusion(as opposed tosimilarity between the marks: see[43]above), those in[27](viz, “I\n                    first have to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to\n                    be so distinctive that the differences would not negate thesimilarity” [emphasis added]\n                        and[28](viz, “the\n                    differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s sign\n                    are sufficient so that the latter does not capture the distinctiveness of the\n                    registered mark and is therefore notsimilarto\n                    the defendant’s mark”(emphasis added)) of the decision make it clear\n                        thatthe distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween\n                    the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.47     In any event, the Court of Appeal’s\n                    subsequent decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)does indicate that the distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor to be considered in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA and is not confined to the analysis of the\n                    likelihood of confusion:Similarity between the mark and the\n                        sign…23    …There was simply no evidence before the court to show\n                                that the word “polo” per se is distinctive.\n                            Indeed, the word “polo” is an ordinary English word\n                            meaning a game played on horseback…We\n                                recognise that some marks are inherently distinctive because they\n                                consist of inventive words without any notional or allusive\n                                quality.

Where\n                                common words are included in a registered mark, the courts should be\n                                wary of granting a monopoly in their use: seeThe European Limited v The Economist Newspaper\n                                Limited[1998] FSR 283 at 289–290 and\n                            “FRIGIKING” Trade Mark [1973] RPC 739 at 753.Any alleged distinctiveness must be acquired through use.\n                                Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                                light of all the circumstances of the case.\n                        ...24Bearing in mind that\n                                “polo” is a common English word, we are unable to see\n                                how it could be said that the sign “POLO PACIFIC” with\n                                its special font and design is similar to the mark\n                                “POLO” except in the broadest of sense that one word\n                                is common.

All the more so when the appellant was not\n                                even claiming a monopoly of the word “polo”.\n                                Accordingly, we agree with the judge that the two are visually,\n                                aurally and conceptually different.[emphasis added]48     In accordance with this approach, I now\n                    proceed to examine whether Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark\n                    is “similar” to AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.(2)   Visual similarity49     In the case of word marks, a determination of\n                    visual similarity typically involves looking at the (seeBently & Shermanat p 865):(a)length of the marks;(b)structure of the marks (ie, whether there are the same number of words);\n                            and(c)whether the same letters are used in the\n                            marks.50     When comparing two marks visually, one must\n                    also bear in mind the “imperfect recollection” of the consumer\n                        (ie, that the consumer may not be able to\n                    remember a mark perfectly) (seeNautical Concept Pte Ltd v\n                        Jeffrey Mark Richard[2007] 1 SLR 1071 at [30]). The\n                    average consumer only rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between\n                    the marks, and so must place his trust in the “imperfect picture of [the\n                    two marks] that he has kept in his mind” (Lloyd\n                        Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999]\n                    2 CMLR 1343, 1358-9). Accordingly, where at first glance two marks may\n                    appear to be dissimilar, when the possibility of imperfect recollection is taken\n                    into account, the two marks may in fact be similar (seeBently & Shermanat p 865). Hence, the court will not\n                    compare the two marks side by side and examine them in detail because\n                    “the person who is confused often makes comparison from memory removed in\n                    time and space from the marks” (Caterpillar Inc v Ong\n                        Eng Peng (formerly trading as Catplus International)[2006]\n                    2 SLR 669 at [55] per Tay Yong Kwang J). The court should also\n                    not take into account “any external added matter or circumstances”\n                    as the comparison is mark for mark.51     I have already set out at[13]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were visuallydissimilar. While the PAR’s statement by itself\n                    that:68    … the simple analysis in visual similarity\n                            is merely to look at the marks…isinaccurategiven that the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA must also necessarily consider, if any, the distinctive\n                    components of the marks (see[43]–[47]above), this\n                    was nevertheless done because the PAR also noted in the same paragraph\n                    that:68    … I do not think that the language\n                            represented by the letters [in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                            GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark]is so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                                any dominant element…[emphasis\n                        added]52     The PAR’s approach (viz, by looking at the word marksandconsidering whether the language represented by the letters\n                    in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                    any dominant element) was consistent with that adopted by the High Court inThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(see[45]above), which was affirmed on appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA).53     In the present instance, although the word\n                    marks of Ozone and AMP share one common denominator,viz, the word “GLAMOUR”, I agreed with the\n                    PAR’s observation that there were:… many visual differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                        mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has\n                        two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one.Furthermore, given that the word “HYSTERIC”, which\n                    appears at the beginning of Ozone’s word mark, is almost of equal length\n                    to the word “GLAMOUR”, I could not see how it would be entirely\n                    overlooked or overshadowed by the word “GLAMOUR”. That\n                    Ozone’s word mark has two words was to my mind a visual difference. Thus,\n                    even if “GLAMOUR” is the more common word of the two (ie, “HYSTERIC” and\n                    “GLAMOUR”) and may come to mind more quickly than\n                    “HYSTERIC”, the consumer with an imperfect recollection (see[50]above) would still remember that\n                    Ozone’s word mark has an additional word to “GLAMOUR”. In\n                    these circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that\n                    Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was visuallydissimilarto AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark.(3)   Aural similarity54     I have already set out at[14]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were aurallydissimilar. It is worth noting that inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1943) 60 RPC 87, Luxmoore LJ’s\n                    dissenting judgment stated, at 108:[t]he answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too\n                        nearly the sound of another …must nearly always depend on first impression,\n                        for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be\n                        deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has\n                        perhaps animperfect recollectionof it who is\n                        likely to be deceived or confused. [emphasis added]This statement was cited with approval in the House of Lords by\n                    Viscount Maugham inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1945)\n                    62 RPC 65 at 72.55     InBently &\n                        Shermanat p 865, the learned authors noted that:When comparing marks aurally, tribunals have tended to carry out a\n                        quantitative assessment: do the two signs have more syllables in common than\n                        not?In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR’s\n                    approach in dealing with the question of aural similarity was entirely\n                    consistent with the foregoing approach.56     In this case, both “HYSTERIC”\n                    and “GLAMOUR” were English words, although the latter could be\n                    said to be the more common English word. However, it must be borne in mind that\n                    Ozone’s word markstartswith the entirely\n                    separate word “HYSTERIC” preceding the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. Also, Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark would be read and pronounced as two separate and distinct words, in\n                    the order of “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”. AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark, on the other hand, would be read as a single\n                    word. The comparison in this case was between a two-word mark and a single word\n                    mark, so that even if the actual word “HYSTERIC” was forgotten, it\n                    would not be forgotten that there was an additional word in Ozone’s word\n                    mark. While I did not agree entirely with the reasons of the PAR, I also\n                    concluded that the words marks were aurallydissimilar.(4)   Conceptual similarity57     With regard to the requirement of conceptual\n                    similarity,Bently & Shermannote at\n                    p 866 (footnotes omitted):Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of the ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark.\n                        …AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark in the present case\n                    clearly relied on the orthodox meaning of “glamour”.58     In this instance, the PAR had held that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilar. Ozone contended that the PAR, who had found the word\n                    marks both visually and aurallydissimilar, had\n                    then subsequently erred in his finding that the word marks were similar on the\n                    basis of conceptual similarityalone. To this end,\n                    it referred to the following passage in the decision of the High Court inMcDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte\n                        Ltd[2004] 2 SLR 652 (McDonald’s (HC)) (an appeal against which was dismissed by\n                    the Court of Appeal inMcDonald’s\n                    (CA):43    As to the visual and\n                            aural similarities of the marks, I do not consider them to be\n                            confusingly similar. There are indeed significant visual differences\n                            between them – the depiction of an eagle as opposed to the golden\n                            arches forming the letter “M” – and aural\n                            differences – “McChicken”,\n                            “McNuggets”, “Egg McMuffin” and\n                            “Sausage McMuffin” compared to “MacTea”,\n                            “MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles”. Below the\n                            word component “MacTea”, for example, the legend\n                            “3-in-1 Instant Hot Tea” appears. Other than the letter\n                            “M” in “MacTea”, there is no mark similar to\n                            the opponents’ “M” logo anywhere on the packaging.\n                            The word marks are also different in appearance in terms of colour, font\n                            and typeface. The second and third syllables of the application marks\n                            are different in sound from the opponents’. The differences leave\n                            different impressions on people’s\n                            minds.44    Is there a conceptual\n                            link between the two in that the common use of the first syllable\n                            “Mac” or “Mc” means that both are likely to\n                            be taken as indicative of a common identity? The use of the first\n                            syllable “Mac” in the applicants’ range of products\n                            is not unlike the case of the opponents in that TWC has admitted to the\n                            use of the same naming system as McDonald’s. But it does not, in\n                            my view, override the other differences mentioned earlier and, when\n                            viewed as a whole,I do not believe there will be\n                                confusion between the rival marks. Having found the dissimilarity in\n                                the marks, visually and aurally, the common idea conveyed by\n                                competing marks is not overriding or determinative. InSports Cafe Ltd v Registrar of Trade\n                                Marks(1998) 42 IPR 552, the court at 557\n                            observed:[T]he fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only\n                            if the marks themselves look or sound alike.

In these circumstances, Ozone’s reading ofMcDonald’s (HC)was incorrect in that itconflatedCondition 1 and Condition 3, which\n                    as observed inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA), are\n                    separate conditions.60     The observation of the Australian Federal\n                    Court inSports Café Ltd v Registrar of Trade\n                        Marks(1998) 42 IPR 552 (“Sports\n                        Café”) at [557] that:… the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevantonlyif the marks themselves look or sound\n                        alike. [emphasis added]also merits closer scrutiny. This observation was made by the Federal\n                    Court inSports Caféafter reviewing an extract\n                    from the earlier decision ofCooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v\n                        Sigmund Pumps Ltd(1952) 86 CLR 536 (“Cooper Engineering”). InSports Café, the Federal Court stated at 556-557 that:The idea behind the markInCooper Engineeringthe application was\n                        for registration of the words “Rain King”. The\n                        opponent’s mark was RAINMASTER.…After pointing out the differences between the suffix\n                        “master” and the word “King” in appearance and\n                        sound [Dixon, William and Kitto JJ] continued (at 538-9):The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for\n                            the appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising\n                            from the two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or\n                            supremacy of the article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to\n                            falling rain or artificial rain as it was called during the argument.\n                            But it is obvious that trade marks, especially word marks, could be\n                            quite unlike and yet convey the same idea of the superiority or some\n                            particular suitability of an article for the work it was intended to do.\n                            To refuse an application for registration on this ground would be to\n                            give the proprietor of a registered trade mark a complete monopoly of\n                            all words conveying the same idea as his trade mark. The fact that two\n                            marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create a\n                            deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken\n                            into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or\n                            sounded alike were likely to deceive.Thus the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if\n                        the marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip\n                        the balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.61     I could not agree with the narrow approach inCooper Engineering. While I agreed that one\n                    should be slow to refuse registration of a mark simply on the basis of\n                    conceptual similarity alone, I was also of the view that it would be wrong to\n                    say that conceptual similarity would be relevant only if there was visual or\n                    aural similarity. As mentioned (at[42]above), the relative importance of each type of similarity must necessarily vary\n                    with the circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark\n                    being compared. The fact that one type of similarity is made out also doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. To adopt an overly generalised and restrictive principle that\n                    conceptual similarity isonlyrelevant to\n                    determining similarity between marks when either visual or aural similarity has\n                    been made out would be to ignore the fact that each aspect of similarity can\n                    vary in different degreesvis-à-viseach other\n                    depending on the circumstances, and trade-offs are entirely possible between the\n                    three aspects of similarity – for example, conceptual similarity can\n                    offset visual and aural dissimilarities. A similar approach was also adopted inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer & Co GmbH v Klijsen\n                        Handel BV[2000] FSR 77 (a decision which was followed by\n                    the High Court inRichemont International SA v Goldlion\n                        Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR 401) at\n                    84:28.    In order to assess the degree of similarity\n                            between the marks concerned, the nationalcourt must\n                                determine the degree of visual, aural or conceptual similarity\n                                between them and, where appropriate, evaluate the importance to be\n                                attached to those different elements, taking account of\n                            the category of goods or services in question and the circumstances in\n                            which they are marketed. [emphasis added]In these circumstances, I was of the view that, in this instance,\n                    despite the word marks being visually and aurally dissimilar, conceptual\n                    similarityneverthelessdeserved\n                    consideration.62     The PAR’s reasons for holding that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilarhave already been set out above at[15]. Against this, Ozone contended however that\n                    the two marks were conceptuallydissimilar. It\n                    pointed out that while the word “GLAMOUR” was defined in the\n                    onlineMerriam-Websterdictionary as “an\n                    exciting and often illusory and romantic attractiveness”, the usage of\n                    the word “HYSTERIC”, which was defined in theLongman Dictionary of the English Languageas “someone\n                    suffering from hysteria”, changed the complexion of the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. According to it, although the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” was still present in “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”,\n                    the concept had varied because one does not associate “HYSTERIC”\n                    with “GLAMOUR”. To support its position, it cited the case ofItochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9 (“Itochu”), where\n                    the marks under comparison were “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL”, as being “closely analogous” to the\n                    present factual matrix. In holding that these marks were conceptuallydissimilar, the PAR in that case made the following\n                    observations at [37]:37    Bearing in mind the Opponents’ argument that\n                            the average consumer normally perceives the mark as a whole without\n                            analysing its various details - a principle which has also been relied\n                            on by the Applicants - and that marks should not be compared side by\n                            side as marks are generally remembered by general impressions rather\n                            than by recollection of the whole;I find that there\n                                is no conceptual similarity between the Opponents’ and the\n                                Applicants’ marks. The Applicants’\n                                “SWEETCAMEL” mark does not convey the same idea and\n                                impression as the Opponents’ marks. The Opponents’\n                                “CAMEL” marks evoke the sense of ruggedness, adventure\n                                and masculinity whereas the Applicants’ mark which is preceded\n                                by the adjective “sweet” projects a totally opposite\n                                impression. [emphasis added]The decision inItochuwas upheld on\n                    appeal by the High Court.63     In the present instance, while the PAR was of\n                    the view that the word “HYSTERIC” did modify the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” to a “certain point”, the main concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” hadnotbeen\n                    “completely reversed” as inItochu.\n                    In this aspect, the PAR observed:70    … In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark\n                            still relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’,\n                            albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically\n                            glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold\n                            true; the concept of [Ozone] cannot be that the clothes do not look\n                            glamorous at all, otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their\n                            mark, which is to sell designed clothes at a premium\n                        price.71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is\n                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use\n                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to orthodox meaning\n                            of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it but\n                            still is based on ‘glamour’. ...64     I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s\n                    holding that the word marks in this case were “in some way” (as\n                    opposed to completely or to a large extent) conceptually similar. As Ozone\n                    conceded, the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still present in\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”.65     The inquiry however does not stop here. The\n                    distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark must also be\n                    considered at this stage.(5)   Distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word\n                mark66     In the present case, the PAR did not find\n                    it:72    … necessary to follow the principles\n                            [enunciated inThe European Ltd v The Economist\n                                Newspaper Ltd[1998] ETMR 307] of descriptive elements\n                            allowing closer similarity…because he was of the opinion that:… that principle in particular should only act as a[n] advanced\n                        argument in case the basic analyses do not reveal any clear result.67     This approach is howevercontraryto that set out above at[43]–[47]where the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.68     In these circumstances, I was of the view that\n                    the PAR had erred in failing to gofurtherafter\n                    considering the visual, aural and conceptual similarity of the word marks to\n                    consider the level of distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark in his inquiry into the similarity between the marks under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.69     In the present instance, there was no evidence\n                    before me to show that the word “GLAMOUR”, which is an ordinary\n                    English word (see[62]above) and not an\n                    inventive word, is inherently distinctive. The word “GLAMOUR”, the\n                    title of AMP’s magazine, in factdescribesthe very nature of the content in AMP’s magazine, which is described, on\n                    its website, as a magazine for young women interested in fashion, beauty and a\n                    contemporary lifestyle and which contains a number of photographs and\n                    advertisements displaying fashionable clothing and accessories. In my view, the\n                    word “GLAMOUR” isnotinherently\n                    distinctive.70     Has the word mark “GLAMOUR” then\n                    acquired distinctiveness through use in Singapore? To my mind, based on the\n                    limited and unsatisfactory evidence tendered by AMP which did little to support\n                    its claim that the “GLAMOUR” mark was extensively used in\n                    Singapore, this question must be answered in the negative. As evidence in\n                    support of its circulation figures between 1990 - 2002 (see [14] of the GD), AMP\n                    tenderednineinvoices from STP Distributors Pte\n                    Ltd dated:(a)10 March 2000 to “TIMES THE BOOKSHOP\n                            PTE LTD” at Centrepoint Shopping Centre (“TIMES”)\n                            showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(b)14 July 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of 40\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(c)8 September 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            40 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(d)24 August 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(e)7 September 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            50 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(f)26 October 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(g)18 January 2002 to a “COLD\n                            STORAGE” supermarket outlet showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(h)12 April 2002 to TIMES showing a sale\n                            of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines; and(i)13 September 2002 to TIMES showing a\n                            sale of 20 “GLAMOUR” magazines.71     It may readily be observed that these nine\n                    invoices related only to sales inspecificmonths\n                    in thelimitedperiod from 2000 to 2002. They did\n                    not reflect a monthly distribution from 1984 (the year AMP claimed its use of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started) and neither did they\n                    correspond to the total distribution figures submitted by AMP (see [14] of the\n                    GD). For example, although the invoice dated 24 August 2001 reflected only\n                    the sale of 30 copies of the September 2001 edition of the\n                    “GLAMOUR” magazine to TIMES, AMP claimed a distribution figure of\n                    823 in September 2001. The nine invoices adduced supported only a fraction of\n                    the distribution figures claimed by AMP. Furthermore, the nine invoices related\n                    only to the distribution of the “GLAMOUR” magazine toonebranch of TIMES (viz,\n                    the Centrepoint outlet) andasingle supermarket.\n                    There was nothing in evidence to support the promotion and/or subsequent sale of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” magazine to the Singapore public. In these\n                    circumstances, given the paucity of AMP’s evidence, I was of the view that\n                    it could not be said that the “GLAMOUR” mark had acquired\n                    distinctiveness through use in Singapore.72     AMP sought to argue, without raising any\n                    relevant authority, that its “GLAMOUR” word mark was distinctive\n                    by virtue of the fact that it was a registered trade mark under the Act. However\n                    such a line of argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA):23 …Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                        light of all the circumstances of the case. No authority has been cited to\n                        substantiate the assertion that the fact of registration is conclusive as to\n                        the distinctiveness of a mark. Neither does it follow that the incorporation\n                        of an entire registered word mark would automatically lead to infringement.\n                        …(6)   Conclusion on the overall similarity between the\n                marks73     Given my conclusion that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark was visually and aurallydissimilar, but conceptuallysimilar, and that “GLAMOUR” was merely descriptive\n                    and neither inherently distinctive nor distinctive by use, I was of the view\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. Strictly speaking,\n                    having arrived at this conclusion, it was not necessary, for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA to go on to consider\n                    Condition 2 (see [36(b)] above) and Condition 3 (see [36(c)] above).\n                    Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I shall do so.Condition 2: Similarity of goods74     With regard to this requirement, the learned\n                    authors ofBently & Shermannote at\n                    p 869:2.3.2 When are goods or services\n                        similar?The question of whether goods or services are similar depends on the facts\n                        of the case. When deciding whether a trade mark application falls foul of\n                        one of the relative grounds for refusal, the comparison is normally between\n                        the goods or services for which the earlier mark has been registered and the\n                        goods or services to which the application relates. …75     The relevant factors for assessing similarity\n                    of goods covered by Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and\n                    AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark are (seeBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd[1996] RPC\n                    281 (“British Sugar”) at\n                    296–297):(a)     the respective uses of the\n                        respective goods;(b)     the respective end users of the respective goods:(c)     the physical nature of the\n                        goods;(d)     the\n                        respective trade channels through which the goods reach the\n                    market;(e)     in the case\n                        of self-serve consumer items, whether in practice they are respectively\n                        found or likely to be found on the same or different shelves;\n                    and(f)     whether the\n                        respective goods are competitive or complementary. This inquiry may take\n                        into account how those in trade classify goods, for instance whether market\n                        research companies who act for industry put the goods or services in the\n                        same or different sectors.These factors were adopted inJohnson & Johnsonat [14] andMediaCorpat [41]. These factors need not all be\n                    satisfied before the goods can be treated as similar (Johnson\n                        & Johnsonat [18]).76     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanexplain at pp 869-870 (footnotes\n                    omitted) how these factors were applied inBritish Sugar\n                        vis-à-visa non-distinctive mark (as I had adjudged\n                    “GLAMOUR” to be (see[66]–[72]above)\n                    :[British Sugar] illustrates how the courts\n                        have applied the factors in the case of a non-distinctive mark (namely\n                        TREAT). There the question was whether a sweet syrup to be poured over\n                        desserts was similar to a sweet-flavoured spread. Jacob J concluded\n                        that the goods were not similar, explaining that the goods were used\n                        differently (the spread could be used on desserts but generally would not\n                        be); were not in direct competition; were located in different places in\n                        supermarkets (the spread with jams, the dessert sauce with desserts); were\n                        physically different (the spread was more viscous than the sauce); and were\n                        treated differently by market researches. In contrast inBalmoral Trade Mark[[1999] RPC 297,302], whisky and wine\n                        were held to be similar goods: although the two products have very different\n                        producers, it is common to find them being bought and sold by the same\n                        merchants, and sold through the same outlets.77     As noted above at[17], the PAR however saw no reason to decide along the lines of\n                    theBritish Sugarfactors (see[75]above) in coming to his conclusion\n                    that:… the scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (“Magazines, books and publications”)\n                        is clearly a sub-set of the goods of [Ozone] (in particular the mention of“printed matter”in the\n                        description of [Ozone’s] goods).[emphasis in original]78     The PAR had also referred to an apparent\n                    concession by Ozone that “there may be an overlap [between AMP’s\n                    goods and] the goods that [Ozone is] applying for”. For convenience, it\n                    would be useful to set out the nature of the parties’ respective\n                    goods:Ozone’s goods in\n                                        Class 16AMP’s goods in\n                                        Class 16Paper and cardboard;\n                                            industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                                            paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper;\n                                            handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’\n                                            chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners\n                                            of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags;printed matter; paintings and\n                                            calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;\n                                            playing cards; stationery and study\n                                        materialsMagazines,\n                                                books and\n                                    publicationsIn the course of the hearing before me, Ozone pointed out that its\n                    concession of an overlap with AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” wasonlylimited to\n                    “printed matter” and didnotextend\n                    to “paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels\n                    of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                    paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;\n                    banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic\n                    works; photographs, photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study\n                    materials” (“Ozone’s other goods”), which according\n                    to Ozone were “very different” from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone submitted that Ozone’s other goods could\n                    “be broadly classified into stationery, hygiene paper products\n                    labels/banners/blinds made of paper and photographs” and that applying\n                    theBritish Sugartest, Ozone’s other goods\n                    were different in function from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone contended that the parties’ respective target\n                    consumers were also different as people buying magazines would not be purchasing\n                    “stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper\n                    and photographs” as alternatives and accordingly the compared goods were\n                    not in competition. The trade channels were also different. While AMP’s\n                    “magazines, books and publications” were likely to be sold at\n                    newsstands and bookstores, Ozone’s other goods would be sold at\n                    supermarkets, furniture stores or bookstores and that even if Ozone’s\n                    other goods were sold in the same stores, they would be placed at different\n                    sections of the store as “magazines are not usually placed together with\n                    stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper and\n                    photographs”.79     Ozone referred to the decision ofIn the Matter of Application No 2242582A by the Secretary to the\n                        Quorn Hunt to register a series of trade marks in Classes 9, 13, 16, 18, 21,\n                        25 and 41 and In the Matter of Opposition No 90056 by Marlow Foods\n                        Limited(O-319-04)[note: 1](“Marlow Foods”) where the\n                    respective goods in Class 16 being compared were as follows (see para\n                    28):Applicant’s Goods in\n                                            Class 16Opponent’s Goods in\n                                            Class 16Printed\n                                                matter, stationery, writing and drawing\n                                            instruments,cards,\n                                            postcards photographs, pictures,calendars, coasters, posters,diaries, instruction manuals;\n                                            but not including any such goods relating to food\n                                            preparationPrinted matter, books and\n                                            periodicals concerning the use of myco-protein in food\n                                            preparation.[emphasis added]The compared marks were similar (ie,\n                    Condition 1 was satisfied). The hearing officer found that the goods\n                    “printed matter, “cards”, “calendars” and\n                    “diaries” were similar to the Opponent’s goods but allowed\n                    the Applicant’s mark to proceed to registration in respect of the\n                    remaining goods,viz, “…stationery,\n                    writing and drawing instruments, cards, postcards photographs, pictures,\n                    …coasters, posters [and] instruction manuals” which were\n                    considered dissimilar.80     I found Ozone’s arguments and the\n                    approach inMarlow Foodspractical and sensible.\n                    In these circumstances, I was of the view that although “printed\n                    matter” in Ozone’s goods weresimilarto AMP’s goods (viz, “magazines,\n                    books and publications”), Ozone’s other goods weredissimilar. Accordingly, I was of the view that the PAR\n                    had erred in finding that Ozone’s other goods were similar to AMP’s\n                    goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                    publications”). Accordingly, I was of the view that Condition 2 was\n                    thus satisfiedonlyto the extent as described. I\n                    now move on to examine Condition 3.Condition 3: Likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                public81     As stated above at[37],evenwhere the marks are\n                    similarandthe goods are similar, this does not\n                    mean that there willipso factobe confusion in\n                    the mind of the public. There isnopresumption of\n                    confusion even where these two aspects of similarity are made out (The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [8]).82     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanelaborate at p 872 (footnotes omitted)\n                    as to what the public must be confused about:2.3.3 Likelihood of confusion…What must the public be confused about? The next question to consider is\n                        what is meant by ‘likelihood of confusion’ in [s 8(2)(b) TMA]?\n                        In its ‘classic form’,consumers must be\n                            confused about the source or origin of the goods or services –\n                            that is, they must be confused as to the designer, manufacturer,\n                            selector or supplier of the goods or services. In other words, classic\n                            confusion is concerned with the situation where consumers believe that\n                            the goods or services emanate from one organization, but they, in fact\n                            come from a different independent organization. This classic\n                        form of confusion has been extended to accommodate broader understandings of\n                        the source of goods or services. Consequently, aperson\n                            will be confused for the purposes of [s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                            assume that there is some broader kind of economic connection between\n                            the users of marks, for example, that the goods are being provided by a\n                            subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark owner.\n                        …In considering whether there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion, the tribunals must consider whether there is a genuine and\n                            properly substantiated likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that\n                            confusion is hypothetical and remote.

The Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)stated that:The approach to section 27(2) of the\n                            Act5    Section 27(2) of\n                            the Act reads:A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without\n                            the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course\n                            of trade a sign where because —(a)    the sign is\n                                    identical with the trade mark and is used in relation to goods\n                                    or services similar to those for which the trade mark is\n                                    registered; or(b)    the sign is\n                                    similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or\n                                    services identical with or similar to those for which the trade\n                                    mark is registered,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                            public.…8    In our opinion, having examined the express wording\n                            of s 27(2)(b), the step-by-step\n                            approach adopted inBritish Sugaris\n                            conceptually more appropriate and is in line with the structure of the\n                            provision. It seems to us that there will be infringement under that\n                            provision only if three conditions are present. First, the alleged\n                            offending sign must be shown to be similar to the registered mark.\n                            Second, both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar\n                            goods or services. Third, on account of the presence of the first two\n                            conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                            public. As the judge rightly pointed out, s 27(2)(b) does not make it an infringement if the\n                            likelihood of confusion is caused by some other factor. While we can see\n                            some link and overlap between the first and the third conditions, it is\n                            clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is similar to a\n                            registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a\n                            likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                            fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                            circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter\n                            of degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between\n                            a mark and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there\n                            will not be any need to go into the third question of determining\n                            whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean\n                            that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                            goods, that there willipso factobe\n                            confusion in the minds of the public. If that was intended,\n                                s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                            phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no presumption of\n                            confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.To determine the existence of confusion, the court is\n                                entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as the\n                                articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion:\n                                see Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd [1999]\n                                2 SLR 651 and McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises\n                                Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 177. While these two latter cases\n                                related to opposition proceedings under s 15 of the then Trade\n                                Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed), there is no reason why\n                                the concept of “likely to cause confusion” under that\n                                provision should be any different from the concept of\n                                “likelihood of confusion” under the present\n                                s 27(2)(b). As we see it, the global assessment test\n                            is likely to confound the final issue of confusion with the first two\n                            prerequisite conditions. Accordingly, we endorse theBritish Sugarapproach which was adopted by\n                            Lai J.[emphasis added]85     Ozone also referred to the decision of\n                    Kitchin J in the English High Court decision ofJulius\n                        Sämaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd[2006] FSR 42 (“Julius Säamaan”), which involved,inter alia, a trade mark infringement action. The\n                    relevant portion of the decision, at 872, reads:52    There is one further general principle which is\n                            important to have in mind at the outset in considering infringement. The\n                            court must consider the likelihood of confusion arising from the use by\n                            the defendant of the offending sign, discounting added matter or\n                            circumstances.If the sign and the mark are\n                                confusingly similar then the defendant cannot escape by showing that\n                                by something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his\n                                goods from those of the proprietor. In the present case\n                            this is important.Looking at the box in which the\n                                Christmas Tree product is sold, the use of the words “Lumber\n                                Jack Flashing air freshener” must be ignored, as must the\n                                particular circumstance in which the product is sold. The comparison\n                                to be made is between, on the one hand, the Tree marks and, on the\n                                other, the Christmas Tree product itself, and the picture of it\n                                which appears on the box. [emphasis added]86     As may be seen, the approach advocated inJulius Säamaanto determining the likelihood\n                    of confusion, which doesnotlook outside the\n                    marks, isdifferentfrom that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)which “look[s] outside\n                    the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                    likelihood of confusion”. This difference was in fact noted at [18]-[20]\n                    ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC), with reasons offered\n                    as to why the latter approach (ie, that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)) should be\n                    favoured:18    However, while the\n                            global assessment test should be rejected, I am equally uncomfortable\n                            with a strict adherence to old English jurisprudence. In particular,\n                            both parties appeared to agree thatthe test for the\n                                likelihood of confusion under this approach is an exceedingly narrow\n                                one. Once a mark is shown to offend, the user “cannot escape\n                                by showing that by something outside the actual mark itself he has\n                                distinguished his goods from those of the registered\n                                proprietor”: [Saville Perfumery\n                                Ld v June Perfect Ld and F W Woolworth & Co Ld(1941)\n                            58 RPC 147] ([11]supra) at 161.\n                            If this is a correct interpretation of the case, I would decline to\n                            follow this lead for the following\n                            reasons.19    Firstly, it is\n                            worthwhile to note that even the English cases appear to differ on\n                            whether this is the correct approach. InJune\n                                Perfectitself, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR, at\n                            161–162, went on to remark that the degree of similarity required\n                            for a likelihood of confusion to be caused depended on, for example, the\n                            goods in question. Where the customers of the goods in question were not\n                            the sort who would be too careful about the details of the mark and\n                            would only remember some distinguishing feature, it would require very\n                            little for the likelihood of confusion to be caused. If, on the other\n                            hand, this is not the case, then it would require “nothing short\n                            of a degree of resemblance apparent to the eye” for there to\n                            exist a likelihood of confusion. Thus, the court is allowed to look\n                            outside the marks in order to assess how similar the marks must be for\n                            there to exist a likelihood of confusion.Origins\n                                Natural Resources Inc v Origin Clothing Limited[1995]\n                            FSR 280 (“Origins”) is of no\n                            use because the remark there that external added matter or circumstances\n                            should be discounted was made in relation to the defendant’s claim\n                            that since it and the plaintiff were trading in different markets and in\n                            different countries, the likelihood of confusion could never arise.\n                            Jacob J, in that case, rightly held that the courts must assume\n                            that the mark would be used in a normal and fair manner. Plaintiffs do\n                            not need to show that there is actual confusion:Compass Publishing BV v Compass Logistics Ltd[2004] RPC 41;In the matter of an\n                                Application by Edward Hack for the Registration of a Trade Mark\n                                (1941) 58 RPC 91. It is also important to note\n                            that in both these cases, there was no discussion of an earlier case,In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist\n                                Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 (“thePianotistcase”), which was affirmed inSime Darby\n                                Edible Products Ltd v Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 360 (“Sime\n                                Darby”). In thePianotistcase, Parker J, at 777, having reviewed\n                            the decisions that came before, summarised the position of the law as\n                            such:You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their\n                            look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are\n                            to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who\n                            would be likely to buy those goods. … If,considering all those circumstances, you come to the\n                            conclusion that there will be a confusion … then you must refuse\n                            the registration in that case. [emphasis added]InWagamama([11]supra), the court also did not consider thePianotistcase. Nonetheless, Laddie J\n                        was equivocal about whether the court was to find a likelihood of confusion\n                        notwithstanding that the alleged infringer had taken steps to differentiate\n                        his products from the plaintiff’s. For instance, he remarked, at\n                        720–721, that:If … the marks were too similar,usuallyinfringement would be found even if in the\n                            market place the infringer took steps to prevent confusion in fact\n                            occurring ... To this extent therefore,a registered\n                                trade mark created a monopoly which might sometimes go beyond what\n                                was strictly necessary to protect the proprietor’s goods and\n                                his reputation. [emphasis added]I am in agreement with this observation.The protection\n                            that the law offers to a registered proprietor of a trade mark is wide\n                            but it is not infinite. The ambit of that protection should be guided by\n                            the underlying aim of a trade marks regime, which is to ensure that\n                            consumers do not confuse the trade source of one product with another.\n                            For instance, where the consideration of other matters can assist the\n                            court in drawing the line at cases where the likelihood of confusion is\n                            merely imaginary, there is no reason not to do so. Otherwise, the law\n                            will end up extending protection where none is needed.20    Secondly, the\n                            Singapore cases deciding on the question of the likelihood of confusion,\n                            although mostly involving an opposition to the registration of a sign,\n                            have been much clearer and more consistent in allowing the consideration\n                            of these extraneous factors. InSime\n                            Darby, Lim Teong Qwee JC quoted and applied\n                            Parker J’s summation of the law on the issue of confusion\n                            which I quoted at [19] above. InKellogg Co v Pacific\n                                Food Products Sdn Bhd[1999] 2 SLR 651\n                                (“Kellogg”), the Court\n                            of Appeal considered an opposition to the registration of a mark under\n                            s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). It\n                            was held, at [30] and [33],that the likelihood of confusion was to be\n                            determined on the basis of several factors, including the actual use of\n                            the mark, the reputation of the earlier mark and the packaging of the\n                            goods. More recently, in [McDonald’s\n                                (CA)] ([14]supra), the\n                            Court of Appeal held, at [66], that:[T]he question whether a proposed mark will likely give rise to\n                            confusion on account of some similarity with an existing mark is a\n                            question of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. Besides\n                            comparing the marks, also germane are the extent of the reputation of\n                            the existing mark, how the proposed mark is to be used, the nature of\n                            the goods to which the mark will be put, how the goods are to be sold\n                            and who the target customers are: seeIn the Matter\n                                of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ltd(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 at 777. Obviously, these considerations are not\n                            exhaustive.I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s submission that these cases\n                        should be distinguished simply because they dealt with unregistered marks.\n                        Under the relevant statute being considered by the courts in those cases was\n                        a requirement of the mark being “likely to deceive or cause\n                        confusion”. Surely it cannot be argued that this is any different\n                        than the requirement of a “likelihood of confusion” under\n                            s 27(2)(b) of the current TMA.21    Finally,turning to the plain\n                                words of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I find that a proper\n                                construction of the provision does not reject the court’s\n                                discretion in assessing so-called extraneous factors when deciding\n                                whether there is a likelihood of confusion. The only thing that the\n                                statute calls for is that the likelihood of confusion arises from\n                                the similarity. But where the user of a potentially infringing sign\n                                has taken pains to distinguish his products from the registered\n                                proprietor’s good[sic]and services, the effect may be\n                                that the likelihood of confusion, if any, is merely hypothetical or\n                                speculative. This is significant because unlike\n                            s 27(1) TMA, s 27(2)(b) does not\n                            presume that there is a likelihood of confusion. If there is no\n                            likelihood of confusion, there can be no infringement:Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd[2003]\n                            4 SLR 755 at [12]. Section 27(2)(b) TMAalso does not forbid the court\n                                taking into account various factors in deciding the degree of\n                                similarity required in order to find that there exists a likelihood\n                                of confusion.22    Having reviewed the cases, and confining myself\n                            strictly to what is required to decide the present case, I am of the\n                            opinion thatthere are two ways in which factors\n                                extraneous to the mark come into play. One is to establish the\n                                strength of the similarity required in order to decide the question\n                                of whether there exists a likelihood of confusion.\n                            …The court cannot know what degree of similarity causes\n                            confusion unless it is able to assess, for instance, the trading\n                            circumstances of the goods in question and therefore the standard of\n                            care that the ordinary consumer will exercise in that particular case.\n                            The other is this. Where the court finds that there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion by reason of the similarity, the court must go on and enquire\n                            whether this likelihood is a real one or whether it is merely\n                            speculative or hypothetical. Where the infringer has taken sufficient\n                            steps to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s such that the\n                            likelihood of confusion becomes a mere possibility, there is no\n                            infringement. Of course, there is no need for plaintiffs to\n                        demonstrate that there is actual confusion. However, the courts are not to\n                        hold that there is a likelihood of confusion on the basis of “highly\n                        speculative eventuality”:McDonald’s, at [59]…[emphasis added]87     AlthoughThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)was a trade markinfringementaction under s 27(2)(b) TMA, the Court of\n                    Appeal in that case was of the view that s 8(2)(b) of the TMA should besimilarlyconstrued:15    It is of interest to\n                            comparePolo Textilewith10 Royal Berkshire Polo Club Trade Mark[2001] RPC 32 (“Royal\n                                Berkshire”) where an application to register the\n                            mark “10 Royal Berkshire POLO CLUB” was opposed by\n                            the same party as the appellant in the present case. The relevant\n                            English statutory provision read:A trade mark shall not be registered if because —…(b)    it is similar to an earlier trade mark and\n                                    is to be registered for goods or services identical with or\n                                    similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is\n                                    protected,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,\n                            which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade\n                            mark.It would be noted that the material part of the wording of this English\n                        provision (except for the last phrase “which includes the likelihood\n                        of association with the earlier trade mark”) is identical to our\n                        s 8(2) of the Act. It is also similar to our s 27(2)(b) (except again for the last phrase).Of course, this English provision (as our s 8(2)) relates\n                            to refusing the registration of a mark, rather than the infringement of\n                            an existing mark. However, we do not think this distinction should mean\n                            that the meaning to be given to s 27(2)(b) should be any different\n                            from that ascribed to s 8(2) or the equivalent English provision\n                            considered in Royal Berkshire. In addition, we also do not\n                        think that the inclusion of the ending phrase in the English provision in\n                        any way enlarges its meaning. Confusion as to trade origin is already\n                        encompassed in the earlier part of the provision: see Christopher Morcom,\n                        Ashley Roughton & James Graham,The Modern Law of\n                            Trade Marks(Butterworths, 1999 Ed) at\n                        p 208.[emphasis added]Nevertheless, where, as in the present case, there was not much\n                    evidence as to how Ozone intends to apply its mark or to distinguish its goods\n                    from AMP’s in Singapore, the consideration of factors other than the marks\n                    themselves would be limited, although the consideration of other factors was in\n                    principle permissible.88     In the course of the hearing before me, AMP\n                    produced a copy of a magazine, which was a “25th anniversary book”\n                    bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark, which had been purchased\n                    from a bookstore in Singapore in September 2009. However, in my view, this\n                    itself did not constitute much evidence about Ozone’s intentions in\n                    Singapore with its mark.89     As stated above at[19], the PAR had identified the relevant segment of the public\n                    to be “the entire group of women who read magazines for leisure and [who]\n                    are fashion conscious.” I agreed with this classification. However, I\n                    would add that as noted at [36] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC):The likelihood of confusion…36    The average consumer in Singapore has been\n                            described asliterate, educated, exposed to the world\n                                and unlikely to be easily hoodwinked: (Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte\n                                Ltd[1991] SLR 133]([23]supra) at 143–144, [30]; and [McDonald’s(CA)] at\n                            [64]. This is the starting point. [emphasis added]90     Furthermore, in the context of the average\n                    consumerof magazinesand their purchasing habits,\n                    it has been noted inIn the Matter of Application No 2136517A\n                        in the name of IPC Magazines Limited to register a trade mark in Classes 9,\n                        16 & 35 and In the Matter of Opposition thereto under No 50532 by\n                        Liberty Media for Women LLC[note: 2]that:36. Magazines are primarily obtained by self-selection, which makes the\n                        visual appearance of the title (or trade mark) of primary importance. They\n                        are usually displayed alongside other magazines, grouped according to\n                        subject matter. It is possible that a women’s magazine could be\n                        displayed alongside, or in the proximity of one for teenagers and young\n                        women, which would afford a side-by-side comparison. I cannot, however say\n                        that that would necessarily be the case, particularly in circumstances where\n                        the magazine is obtained by subscription. There are circumstances when oral\n                        use, such as a consumer making an enquiry regarding the availability of a\n                        publication will be of relevance.Although magazines are\n                            relatively inexpensive items, the consumer is, I consider, reasonably\n                            discerning in the selection, where able, often picking up the magazine\n                            to glance through its contents prior to making the decision to\n                            purchase. [emphasis added]91     In these circumstances, given my conclusion\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA (see[73]above), and bearing in mind the\n                    characteristics of the average consumer who would be likely to buy the goods of\n                    Ozone and AMP (see[82]-[83]and[89]above) and who would “exercise some care and good sense in making his\n                    purchases” (see[83]above), I was of\n                    the view that even for “printed matter”, let alone Ozone’s\n                    other goods, the ordinary Singaporean would have little difficulty discerning\n                    that Ozone’s goods bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark are\n                    not from the same trade source or origin as AMP’s goods bearing the\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark. In this aspect, it would be useful to refer toIn the Matter of Application No 1568121 in the name of\n                        Global Spa and in the matter of Opposition thereto under No 45679 in the\n                        name of Advance Magazine Publishers Inc.[note: 3]Here,\n                    the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office Hearing Officer, adopting a\n                    similar stance, observed as follows:Titles of magazines by their nature tend to make\n                            varying degrees of reference to their subject matter or target\n                            readership, and consequently many have a low level of distinctiveness.\n                            The word GLAMOUR is no exception. It is an ordinary and well known word\n                            in the English language which readily conveys the idea of clothing,\n                            make-up, etc, and given that the opponents say that their magazine sold\n                            under the GLAMOUR trade mark is well known for its features relating to\n                            fashion and related topics I consider that it falls into the category of\n                            a mark with a low degree of distinctiveness. I make this\n                        observation only insofar as to say that as it isnot the\n                            strongest of marks this is likely to impact on customer perception of\n                            the mark and the issue of confusion. [emphasis added]I should add that this observation was made even though the opponents\n                    in that case, AMP, had claimed, as in this case (see[7]above), that the “GLAMOUR” mark had been\n                    registered in several other countries. Furthermore, it bears mention also that,\n                    as stated at paras 10 and 11 of the statutory declaration declared in Japan on\n                    5 December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani (see[8]above), that AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Printed matter (magazines, newsletters and books; computer programs);\n                        paper products (posters, paper patterns)and Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                        paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                        paper patterns; tailors’ chalk, table cloths of paper; blinds of\n                        paper; banners of papers; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter;\n                        paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing\n                        cards; stationery and study materialshave in factco-existedon the United\n                    Kingdom Trade Marks Register since 2001.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA92     For all the foregoing reasons, I was thus of\n                    the view that AMP’s opposition to the registration of Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 pursuant to\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA shouldnotsucceed. The PAR’s decision on this provision was\n                    accordinglyreversed. I now proceed to examine\n                    AMP’s opposition pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA93     As stated above at[28], AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding that the\n                    law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.94     It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an\n                    action for passing off, it had to prove the following classical trinity of\n                    elements,viz:(a)     a goodwill or reputation attached to\n                        the goods and services it supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by\n                        association with the identifying “get-up”, such that the\n                        “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive\n                        specifically of AMP’s goods or services;(b)     a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public\n                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe\n                        that the goods offered by Ozone are the goods of AMP; and(c)     that it is likely to suffer damage by\n                        reason of the erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation\n                        that the source of its goods is the same as the source of those offered by\n                        AMP.(See the decisions of the Court of Appeal inNovelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009]\n                        3 SLR 216 (“Amanresorts”) at [36]-[37] andCity\n                            Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2009]\n                        SGCA 53 (“City Chain”)). As\n                        these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see[21]above), I needed only to examine whether\n                        the PAR had erred inapplyingthese three\n                        elements to the facts of the present case.Element 1: Goodwill or reputation95     In the submissions before me, goodwill and\n                    reputation were referred to interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer\n                    to goodwill only. The two essential features of goodwill, which is a question of\n                    fact, were summarised recently inCity Chainas\n                    follows:62 In [Amanresorts] at [39], this court held\n                        thatthe two essential features of goodwill are that\n                            “it is the association of a good, service or business on which\n                            the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been\n                            applied with a particular source” and “this association is\n                            an ‘attractive force which brings in custom’”.\n                            Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a question of fact. Relevant\n                            factors include advertising, trading, volume of sales, and whether it\n                            has been registered. But the fact that the mark or indicia is\n                        not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the\n                        plaintiff’s goods or services (seeHalsbury Laws of\n                            Singaporevol 13(3) (LexisNexis Singapore) at\n                        para 160.8172007). [emphasis added]96     It bears mention that where a case involves\n                    indicia which aredescriptiveof the goods or\n                    services in question (as in this case: see[69]above), the law imposes ahigherburden on the plaintiff (ie, AMP) when proving the existence of his goodwill. The leading\n                    decision in this aspect is that of the Court of Appeal inLifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99 SHOP)[2000] 2 SLR 766 (“Lifestyle\n                    1.99”). The facts of and principles stated in that case have\n                    been helpfully summarised inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat p 209 as follows:[17.1.15]… The plaintiff was the\n                        owner of a chain of retail shops which operate under the markONE.99 SHOP. These outlets sold goods ranging from\n                        snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and\n                        common household items. The important characteristic of the\n                        plaintiff’s business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99.\n                        The plaintiff was the first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price\n                        store’ business. About 1-½ years later, the defendant opened its\n                        retail outlets under the markLifestyle 1.99,\n                        selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to\n                        S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the\n                        markONE.99 SHOP, the Court of Appeal laid\n                        down the legal principles as follows:(a)    The law treats quite differently the mark of a\n                            business depending on whether the mark is descriptive or\n                            ‘fancy’.(b)    A mark which isprima\n                                faciedescriptive will only be protected if it can be\n                            shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it\n                            has becomes distinctive of the plaintiff’s business.\n                            ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the law of passing off. In\n                            relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes the goods of the\n                            plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders.(c)    The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean\n                            that it cannot become distinctive, although it would be difficult to\n                            prove. A very great burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove that the\n                            mark has acquired a secondary meaning.…97     In a similar vein, inJohnson & Johnson, where the registered mark was\n                    “Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was\n                    “Careree”, the court noted:24In regard to goodwill, it must\n                                [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a descriptive\n                                word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become\n                                associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to\n                                claim a monopoly of descriptive words: seeNippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paint (Singapore)\n                                Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 1 andSuper Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte\n                                Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in\n                            appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have\n                            taken on a “secondary meaning” or become\n                            “distinctive in fact”. An example is\n                            “Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that\n                            sells clothes for pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis\n                            added]98     In the present case, bearing in mind thegreaterburden of proof on AMP (in light of my\n                    earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely\n                    descriptive: see[69]above), I was of the\n                    view that the PAR haderredin concluding that\n                    there was goodwill (see[22]above). Given\n                    the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of\n                    sales (viz, the nine invoices: see[70]above) as elaborated above at[71]and the lack of evidence ofanypromotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in\n                    Singapore, it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has\n                    acquired a “secondary meaning”. As the PAR observed:88    [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from\n                            1984, but there does not seem to be good evidence that the magazines\n                            started selling in Singapore from that time, only a table and random\n                            invoices that do not date beyond the year 2000. [Ozone states] that the\n                            circulation numbers for Singapore are not impressive, 903 copies at its\n                            highest only. The Opponents have submitted that this is high relative to\n                            the numbers of other publications that are sold, as evidenced by the\n                            invoices from their distributors.However, the number\n                                903 copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low\n                                for the population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that\n                                time.…93    … [T]he circulation\n                                numbers in Singapore are unimpressive, and there is no advertising\n                                in Singapore to increase its recognition of [AMP’s]\n                                marks. [emphasis added]99     The paucity of evidence in the present case\n                    must be contrasted with the ample evidence inLifestyle\n                        1.99of the plaintiff’s goodwill. As stated inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    pp 210-211:[17.1.18]    In [Lifestyle 1.99], the plaintiff succeeded in\n                            discharging this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with\n                            the plaintiff’s sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of\n                            operation was substantial in the light of the very low price of each\n                            item), the extensive advertisements and media coverage on the\n                            plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of the people\n                            surveyed were aware or had heard of theOne.99\n                                Shopand at least 40% knew where the outlets were\n                            located. The court found that all this evidence pointed to some goodwill\n                            in the plaintiff’s business. …100    In these circumstances, I was of the view\n                    that AMP had failed to establish the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In\n                    the light of this conclusion, there was no need for me to set out my views on\n                    the second element of misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so\n                    for the sake of completeness.Element 2: Misrepresentation101    With regard to the element of\n                    misrepresentation, the learned author ofLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporenotes at p 225 (footnotes\n                    omitted):[18.0.1]The key element here is deception.\n                        The court is concerned with the following question:has\n                            the defendant made a false representation that led to, or is likely to\n                            lead, to deception or confusion amongst the public? The nature of the\n                            deception or confusion may relate to the trade source of the goods or\n                            services, or to the quality of the goods or services.\n                            …[18.0.2]Although the key element is deception, it is not\n                            necessary to prove that the defendant has an intention to deceive or\n                            mislead the public. For this reason, it has been said thatthe state of the mind of the defendant is immaterial;\n                            rather, what matters is the impact on the persons to whom the\n                            misrepresentation is addressed. If the impact on these\n                        persons is such that they would be deceived, the element of\n                        misrepresentation is made out and the defendant cannot avoid a finding of\n                        passing off by the mere fact that his goods are of as good or better quality\n                        than the plaintiff’s, or that the misrepresentation was made\n                        innocently.[emphasis added]102    It would also be useful to refer toAmanresortswhich confirms that confusion is\n                    an essential element of the tort of passing off. As stated in the\n                    headnote:(4)    On the issue of misrepresentation, thetarget audience of misrepresentation in a passing off\n                                action was the actual and potential audience of the claimant.\n                                Misrepresentation was actionable only if it caused confusion and\n                                while there was no need to showactualconfusion, the court had to assess whether there was alikelihoodof confusion from the surrounding facts,\n                                based on the average reasonable person, with characteristics\n                                reflective of the relevant section of the public.\n                            Relevant factors in this case included whether there was any fraudulent\n                            intention in using the name “Amanusa” for the housing\n                            project, and whether the business of the Appellant and the Respondents\n                            were in the same field or closely related fields. The identical\n                            names, the similar Balinese themes, and the presentation of the\n                            Appellant’s housing project as high-quality accommodation were\n                            factors increasing the likelihood of confusion… [emphasis\n                            added]103    Be that as it may, where adescriptivemark is adopted by a plaintiff, aslightdifference between the plaintiff’s mark and\n                    the defendant’s mark is sufficient to distinguish them and to undo any\n                    possibility of confusion in the mark (seeLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat p 211, para 17.1.18, andLifestyle 1.99at [39]).104    In the present case, the PAR had concluded\n                    that there was no misrepresentation because Ozone was not attempting to\n                    “mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                    goods”:101    In the present case, I have made the decision that\n                            the marks are confusingly similar for the purposes of Section 8(2).\n                            However, in paragraph 78 above, I had described that it does not appear\n                            to me, on the evidence, that there is any effort to imply that the\n                            Applicants’ mark is a spin-off mark. Each of [Ozone’s] and\n                            [AMP’s] advertising retain its own special flavour, with no\n                            attempt to copy each other’s style.This\n                                evidence also goes to show that there is clearly no\n                                misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt where [Ozone is]\n                                trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                                goods. [emphasis added]105    The PAR had made his ultimate finding that\n                    there was no misrepresentation on the basis that there was no attempt on the\n                    part of Ozone to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.\n                    This basis of the PAR’s conclusion was incorrect because with regard to\n                    the element of misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the\n                    effect of Ozone’s conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see[102]above) and there can be a\n                    misrepresentation even if it was madeinnocently(seeJohnson & Johnsonat [25]). On the other\n                    hand, Ozone’s state of mind would have been a relevant consideration in\n                    finding an increased likelihood of confusion if Ozone had been found (there was\n                    no evidence of this in this case) to have had an intention to mislead or\n                    deceive. As noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat pp 230-231:[18.4.6]Proof of an intention to deceive is\n                        not a necessary ingredient in this second element, but if such an intention\n                        is established, the burden on the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened.\n                        …106    AMP contended that the PAR had\n                    “committed a further material error of principle by restricting his\n                    analysis to whether there was any confusion…to the origin of the goods as\n                    evident from his conclusion that `there is no attempt where [Ozone was] trying\n                    to mislead or deceive the public as to theorigin of the\n                        goods’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the\n                    “PAR’s restriction of the analysis as such defies established law\n                    that confusion under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to\n                    the origin of [Ozone’s] goods”.107    I accepted thegeneralprinciple that the nature of the confusion may relate to\n                    the trade source of the goods or servicesorto\n                    the quality of the goods. As stated inLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat pp 226-228:18.2MISREPRESENTATION AS TO ORIGIN[18.2.1]The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to\n                            the trade source of the goods or services, or to the quality of the\n                            goods or services. Misrepresentation as to the trade source can take the\n                            form of a false representation that the defendant’s goods or\n                            services are those of the plaintiff, or that the two parties are\n                            connected in some way, for example, the defendant’s business is an\n                            extension, branch or other agency of the\n                        plaintiff’s.…18.3MISREPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY[18.3.1]Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of\n                            the goods or services is an element of misrepresentation about the\n                            quality of the goods or services. The consumer buying the\n                            defendant’s goods thinks that he is getting the quality that he is\n                            accustomed to finding in the plaintiff’s goods. Here\n                        the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation about thequality of his own goods.[18.3.2]It is also possible for the\n                        defendant to make a misrepresentation about the quality of theplaintiff’sgoods…[emphasis added]108    At[96]above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia which was\n                    descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on AMP in\n                    proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof isalsoextended to the element of misrepresentation, as\n                    noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat pp 230-231:18.4PROVING MISREPRESENTATION…[18.4.7]When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive\n                            connotations or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears\n                            a higher burden of proof to show goodwill is extended to the second\n                            element: the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show confusion is also\n                            heavier. The courts will readily regard a slight difference between the\n                            plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark as being\n                            sufficient to distinguish them. [Lifestyle\n                            1.99] is a classic illustration of this principle. …\n                        [emphasis added]109    In my view, it was clear however that\n                    contrary to AMP’s contention (see[106]above), the PAR hadnotrestricted his analysis to only whether there was any confusion to the origin of\n                    the goods but had also considered and rejected AMP’s argument that there\n                    had been a misrepresentation as to quality, albeit in the context of the third\n                    element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the GD cited at[24]above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of\n                    proof on the shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was\n                    of the opinion that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now\n                    move on to consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade\n                    source of the goods.110    In this case, while I accepted that the\n                    proximity of a defendant’s field of activity to a plaintiff’s is a\n                    relevant consideration in deciding whether there is likelihood of confusion (seeLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    p 231, para 18.4.8 andAmanresortsat para\n                    84), and that there wassomeproximity between\n                    Ozone’s field of activity (viz, the design\n                    and retailing offashionapparel andfashionaccessories for both men and women: see[8]above) and AMP’s field of\n                    activity (viz, the “GLAMOUR” mark\n                    primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine\n                    which is devoted to the reporting and portraying of,inter\n                        alia, contemporary women’sfashionand beauty: see[7]above) in that both relate to “fashion”, given that:(a)     the word marks of Ozone and AMP\n                        were visuallydissimilar(see[53]above) and aurallydissimilar(see[56]above);(b)     “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive andnotinherently distinctive nor distinctive by use (see[73]above);(c)     a higher burden of proof is imposed\n                        on AMP (see[108]above);\n                    and(d)     Ozone’s\n                        other goods weredifferentfrom AMP’s\n                        goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                        publications”) (see[80]above),I was of the opinion that the element of\n                    misrepresentation was also not satisfiedvis-à-visOzone’s other goods.111    With regard to “printed\n                    matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an overlap between\n                    “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the\n                    view that, on balance, the element of misrepresentation was also not made\n                    out.Element 3: Damage112    With regard to the element relating to the\n                    question of damage, this was accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were\n                    made out.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4)\n                TMA113    For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no\n                    reason to disturb the PAR’s eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of\n                    opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not made out and must fail.Conclusion114    Given my conclusion that AMP’s\n                    opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(b)and 8(4)\n                    TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s\n                    decision dated 16 March 2009. In so doing, I ordered that:(a)     Ozone’s Trade Mark\n                        Application No T02/03173J for the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark\n                        be allowed to proceed to registration;(b)     the costs awarded to AMP in the hearing before the PAR\n                        be set aside; and(c)     the costs of this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the PAR\n                        be paid by AMP to Ozone.[note: 1]Available\n                                online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-challenge-decision-results/o31904.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 15 December 2009)[note: 2]Available\n                                online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-challenge-decision-results/o16703.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 31 December 2009)[note: 3]Available online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o08400.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 15 December 2009)",

        "Facts pertaining to AMP": "7       With respect to AMP, the PAR set out the\n                    following background facts at [11]–[17] of his GD: [AMP’s] Evidence 11    [AMP’s] only statutory declaration was\n                            declared on 24thAugust 2005 in the United\n                            State [sic] of America by Mr. John W.\n                            Bellando, the Vice President of [AMP] since 1 January 2000. [AMP\n                            states] that the first issue of GLAMOUR magazine had been published more\n                            than 60 years ago in May 1941. Since then [AMP states] that the GLAMOUR\n                            magazine has been devoted to the reporting and portraying [of], among\n                            other things, women’s fashion, beauty, careers, relationships,\n                            sex/health, women’s issues, travel, food, home decorating, cars,\n                            audio, film and more, all directed towards the contemporary working\n                            woman. 12    [AMP states] that [it has] secured registrations or\n                            [has] pending registrations of the GLAMOUR mark in more than 100\n                            countries. There are some copies of some of the Certificates of\n                            Registration attached to the statutory declaration. There is also a\n                            table listing the countries in which the GLAMOUR mark has been\n                            registered or is pending registration. It should be noted that the\n                            number of Certificates of Registration do not match the number of\n                            countries where the GLAMOUR mark is listed as registered. I note that\n                            [AMP has] made assertions that sought to prove that [AMP has] worldwide\n                            reputation. However, to support such an important fact, [it has] only\n                            submitted sample copies of the Certificates of Registration in the\n                            various countries where [it] had claimed the reputation exists. The list\n                            of countries includes 94 countries, whereas the exhibits to the\n                            statutory declaration only show copies of Certificates of Registration\n                            from 43 countries. This is only as far as I can tell; the next issue\n                            that I have with the evidence is that most of it comes without a\n                            certified translation. Since the certificates come from all over the\n                            world, I am presented with a vast array of languages that I am afraid I\n                            do not have the faculty to master. Where this is the case, the\n                            Certificate of Registration shall do nothing more to substantiate the\n                            assertions of [AMP] than if there was no copy submitted at all. It is\n                            truly a pity that, for a fact that is as crucial as the completeness of\n                            the worldwide reputation, there is only partial substantiation of the\n                            assertions of [AMP]. That is not to say that the statement by Mr.\n                            Bellando is of no weight; it was made under oath and the penalties of\n                            being found to be untruthful while under oath strongly discourage any\n                            untruthful statements. However, the case for the worldwide reputation\n                            could have been made much stronger had all the Certificates of\n                            Registration been presented, and accompanied by the certified\n                            translation of the certificate. I have some understanding of the\n                            difficulty that counsel faces when asking for and obtaining this\n                            information, but parties who present a bare statement of worldwide\n                            reputation without anything more will risk facing significant challenges\n                            on their statement, or at least and have their statements bear much less\n                            weight. 13    [AMP states] that [its] GLAMOUR magazine is sold\n                            and distributed in many countries worldwide. The total global\n                            circulation has amounted to at least 2,376,096 copies per month (based\n                            on the average circulation figure for September 2002). [AMP tenders]\n                            into evidence a table of countries where the GLAMOUR magazine is\n                            presently distributed and sold. 14    In terms of domestic sales, [AMP states] that [it]\n                            first commenced use of the GLAMOUR mark from at least as early as\n                            September 1984.

The magazine also outsells more than 98% of\n                            all magazines on the newsstands. The GLAMOUR mark is also world famous\n                            by way of the GLAMOUR websites that are accessible worldwide. By virtue\n                            of this extremely substantial and extensive use of the GLAMOUR mark, the\n                            mark has become distinctive of the Opponents both in Singapore and\n                            globally. 16    There were no advertising and promotion figures\n                            submitted into evidence. 17    [AMP] did not tender a second statutory\n                            declaration.",

He states that he is a brand manager of [Ozone] and has been\n                            for the past 19 years. 19    [Ozone is] a company based in Japan focused on the\n                            design and retailing of fashion apparel and accessories for both men and\n                            women. [Ozone is] the registered [proprietor] of the trade mark HYSTERIC\n                            GLAMOUR in Japan, United Kingdom, United State[s] of America, Hong Kong,\n                            Indonesia, Taiwan and Korea.

In particular,\n                            [Ozone refers] to the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark in the UK in Class 16\n                            covering“Paper and cardboard; industrial\n                                packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of\n                                paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns;\n                                tailor’s chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;\n                                banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter;\n                                paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;\n                                playing cards; stationery and study materials”.\n                            [Ozone highlights] that this Class 16 mark co-exists on the UK\n                            register with [AMP’s] GLAMOUR mark in the UK. [emphasis in\n                            original] 20    [Ozone] had invented the mark HYSTERIC GLAMOUR for\n                            use in connection with fashion apparel. [Ozone] had subsequently used\n                            the mark in Japan since 1984 on clothing, bags, footwear and fashion\n                            accessories. [Ozone] tendered evidence of advertisements in Japanese\n                            magazines as well as extracts from [its] company website as evidence of\n                            the fashion style of the products sold. 21    [Ozone asserts] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has\n                            become extremely famous as a fashion clothes label in Japan. [Ozone\n                            submits] that a travel listing in the website Yahoo! Travel Listing as\n                            well as the list of HYSTERIC GLAMOUR retail stores located throughout\n                            Japan point to a significant reputation built by [Ozone] since\n                            1984. 22    [Ozone claims] that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR brand has\n                            in recent years gained a business presence in countries apart from\n                            Japan. HYSTERIC GLAMOUR stores have been set up in Hong Kong and in the\n                            United States of America. [Ozone asserts] that [it has] two stores in\n                            Hong Kong and 25 stores in the US. I note that, on a careful examination\n                            of the exhibits before me, that the stores that [Ozone claims] are the\n                            stores outside of Japan, are actually more likely to be stores belonging\n                            to other franchises that merely carry HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                        goods. 23    [Ozone’s] goods bearing the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                            mark have yet to be sold or advertised in Singapore. There are no\n                            figures pertaining to sales and advertisements in\n                        Singapore.",
        "The decision of the PAR": "9       As ss 8(2)(b)\n                    and 8(4) TMA were raised in this appeal before me (see[5]above), I shall set out the PAR’s findingsvis-à-visthese two sections only.",
        "The PAR’s findings with respect to s 8(2)(b) TMA": "10     Section 8(2)(b) TMA states: Relative grounds for refusal of\n                        registration 8. —(1)… (2) A trade mark shall not be registered if because\n                        — … (b) it is similar to an earlier\n                        trade mark and is to be registered for goods or services identical\n                        with or similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is\n                        protected, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                        public. 11     With respect to AMP’s opposition under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA, the PAR observed (at [62]\n                    of the GD) that AMP had the burden of proving that the following criteria were\n                    satisfied: (a)     that AMP had earlier trade mark\n                        registrations as defined in s 2 TMA; (b)     that Ozone’s mark (viz, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s\n                        earlier trade marks (viz,\n                        “GLAMOUR”) were similar; (c)     that the goods of Ozone’s mark (viz, “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”) and AMP’s\n                        earlier trade marks (viz,\n                        “GLAMOUR”) were identical or similar; and (d)     there was a likelihood of confusion by\n                        virtue of the similarity of the marks and the goods. 12     The several earlier trade mark registrations\n                    in favour of AMP (see[2]above) were not\n                    disputed by Ozone (see [64] of the GD). The PAR considered whether Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA. As correctly noted by the PAR, there are three\n                    aspects to similarity,viz, visual similarity,\n                    aural or phonetic similarity, and conceptual similarity. Similarity of marks (1)   Visual similarity 13     The PAR found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were visuallydissimilaron a simple visual\n                    analysis and that there was no dominant element in either of the word\n                    marks: 68    I have been assaulted [sic] with diametrically opposed arguments on which\n                            element is the dominant element. But while [AMP tried] valiantly to\n                            deflect attention from the visual aspects by advancing [its] argument\n                            that the dominant element is GLAMOUR, and [AMP] advance[d] equally\n                            trying arguments that the element HYSTERIC is not overshadowed, the\n                            simple analysis in visual similarity is merely to look at the marks. In\n                            this case, there are many visual differences between the marks. The\n                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the\n                            HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one. I do not\n                            think that the language represented by the letters is so unusual or\n                            descriptive that there should be any dominant element. I am of the\n                            opinion that the marks are visually dissimilar. … (2)   Aural or phonetic similarity 14     The PAR also found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were aurallydissimilar: 69    I still cannot help but find that a simple analysis\n                            is all that is required of the test of aural similarity. The simple\n                            analysis here is that the complete sound of [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark\n                            is different from [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark. The simple\n                            facts are that [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark is made up of five\n                            readable syllables in two words with a pause in between, whereas\n                            [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark is two syllables in one word. Three of the\n                            syllables in [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR] mark are not duplicated as\n                            sounds in [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark. This basic analysis shows that\n                            there is a fair bit of dissimilarity between the two marks in terms of\n                            syntax. The question is whether the repetition of two common syllables\n                            that form a common word ‘glamour’ will cause these two\n                            marks, as a whole, to be considered as aurally similar. My answer is no,\n                            and here again I do not think that [Matratzen Concord\n                                GMBH v OHIM, Case T-6/01, Judgment of the Court of First Instance\n                                (fourth Chamber)] can apply to swing the decision the\n                            other way. The case of Matratzen decided (at para XLIII) that, as\n                            between the elements ‘Matratzen’ and ‘Concord’,\n                            the element Matratzen was an invented word with hard to pronounce\n                            consonants and appeared more likely to be remembered by the public. I do\n                            not have this distinction before me in the present case, I only have\n                            before me the words HYSTERIC and GLAMOUR, and I am hard pressed to say\n                            that one is more pronounceable than the other so much so that the public\n                            is more likely to remember it. Consequently, and bearing in mind my\n                            earlier basic analysis of the two marks, I am of the opinion that the\n                            marks are aurally dissimilar. (3)   Conceptual similarity 15     Having found that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark were visuallyandaurallydissimilar, the PAR then found that the words marks were however\n                    conceptuallysimilar: 70    The area of conceptual similarity is the hardest\n                            element to determine in this case. The [Ozone’s HYSTERIC GLAMOUR]\n                            mark and [AMP’s GLAMOUR] mark both bear the word GLAMOUR. The crux\n                            of the decision lies in whether the word GLAMOUR has been modified by\n                            the term HYSTERIC. I note the arguments from both sides relating to the\n                                [sic] whether I should treat the word\n                            HYSTERIC as distinctive or laudatory. I am of the opinion that the word\n                            HYSTERIC does not modify the word GLAMOUR in a similar way as\n                            the…case [inItochu Corporation v Worldwide\n                                Brands Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9]. The word HYSTERIC does\n                            modify the concept of GLAMOUR in a way that is described by [Ozone at\n                            [51] above] to a certain point. However, the main concept is still\n                            ‘glamour’. The concept has not been completely reversed, as\n                            it has been in [Itochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands\n                                Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9], where the ruggedness of the Camel\n                            concept was essentially reversed by the addition of the prefix\n                            ‘sweet’. In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark still\n                            relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’, albeit\n                            injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically glamorous’.\n                            From another point of view this should still hold true; [Ozone’s\n                            concept] cannot be that the clothes do not look glamorous at all,\n                            otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their mark, which is to sell\n                            designed clothes at a premium price. 71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is\n                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use\n                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to [the] orthodox\n                            meaning of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it\n                            but still is based on ‘glamour’. ... 16     On the basis of such conceptual similarityalone, the PAR concluded that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark, though visually and aurally dissimilar, were nevertheless\n                    “similar” within the meaning of s 8(2)(b) TMA. The PAR then proceeded to consider whether the goods\n                    bearing Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were “similar”. Similarity of goods 17     The PAR found that there was similarity in\n                    respect ofonlythe Class 16 goods specified\n                    by Ozone (ie, Ozone’s goods: see[1]above) and AMP (ie, AMP’s goods: see[2]above): 73    … In relation to [AMP’s] goods in\n                            Classes 9, 35, 41 and 42, there is no similarity in terms of the\n                            goods. In relation to [AMP’s] Class 16 goods, [Ozone]\n                            conceded that there may be an overlap with the goods that they are\n                            applying for. Even without this concession, it is clear to me that the\n                            scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (“Magazines, books and publications”) is\n                            clearly a sub-set of [Ozone’s goods](in particular the mention of“printed matter”in\n                            the description of [Ozone’s] goods). There does not seem to be a\n                            need to decide along the lines of the…factors [set out inBritish Sugar PLC v James Robertson & Sons\n                                Ltd[1996] RPC 281]. [emphasis in original] Likelihood of confusion 18     The PAR then considered whether there was a\n                    likelihood of confusion on the part of the public in respect of AMP’s and\n                    Ozone’s Class 16 goods. He noted at [74] of the GD, referring to [66]\n                    of the Court of Appeal’s decision inMcDonald’s\n                        Corp v Future Enterprises Pte Ltd[2005] 1 SLR 177\n                        (“McDonald’s (CA)”)\n                    that: The lack of similarity as between the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark and the\n                        GLAMOUR mark is only one factor in the determination of the likelihood of\n                        confusion, since the element of likelihood of confusion takes into account a\n                        lot more than just the similarity of marks and of the goods. … 19     Following that, the PAR identified the\n                    relevant segment of the public to be “the entire group of women who read\n                    magazines for leisure and [who] are fashion conscious”. As Ozone had\n                    “not submitted very much on the intended use of the goods other than the\n                    specifications” (see [76] of the GD), the PAR considered notional use by\n                    Ozone of the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in assessing the likelihood\n                    of confusion. In this aspect, the PAR noted that given the similarity of goods\n                    (see[17]above) and because it was\n                    “reasonable to speculate” (since Ozone had not submitted any\n                    evidence of the actual or intended use of its goods) that any use by Ozone of\n                    the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark would not fall far from their core\n                    business of “design and retailing of fashion apparel and accessories for\n                    both men and women”, this “may result in a situation where both\n                    the marks will be used on similar goods”. The PAR rejected AMP’s\n                    submission that the public would see Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” mark as a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark purely by the application of the conceptually\n                    similar marks onto similar goods and was of the view that there was no\n                    calculated attempt to deceive because Ozone’s and AMP’s\n                    “advertising retain their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy\n                    each other’s style” (see [78] of the GD). Nevertheless, the PAR\n                    concluded at [79] of the GD: 79    Having considered all the above factors, I believe\n                            that there is a likelihood of confusion on the part of the relevant\n                            public, in this case the members of the public who are female who read\n                            magazines for leisure and are fashion conscious. Although there are some\n                            differences between the [AMP’s “GLAMOUR”] mark and\n                            [Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”] mark in terms of visual\n                            and aural similarity, there are similarities in concept. This similarity\n                            could give rise to a likelihood of confusion in the relevant segment of\n                            the public if the marks were affixed on similar goods, especially since\n                            [Ozone’s and AMP’s businesses] overlap. Where this is the\n                            case, this ground of opposition will succeed as all the essential\n                            elements of Section 8(2) [TMA] are made out.",
        "The PAR’s findings with respect to passing off under\n                s 8(4) TMA": "20     Section 8(4) TMA states: (4) A trade mark shall not be registered if, or to the extent\n                        that, its use in Singapore is liable to be prevented — (a) by virtue of any rule of law (in\n                        particular, the law of passing off) protecting an unregistered trade mark\n                        or other sign used in the course of trade; or (b) by virtue of an earlier right\n                        other than those referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (3) or\n                            paragraph (a), in particular by\n                        virtue of the law of copyright or any law with regard to the protection\n                        of designs. 21     Under this section, the PAR first observed, at\n                    [96] of the GD, that to succeed in an action for passing off under s 8(4)\n                    TMA, AMP had to satisfy three criteria,viz,\n                    that: (a)     AMP’s goods and services had\n                        acquired a goodwill or reputation in the market and are known by some\n                        distinguishing feature; (b)     there was a misrepresentation by Ozone (whether or not\n                        intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe that goods or\n                        services offered by Ozone were goods or services of AMP;\n                    and (c)     AMP had\n                        suffered or was likely to suffer damage as a result of the erroneous belief\n                        engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation. Goodwill or reputation 22     With regard to the first element of goodwill\n                    or reputation, the PAR observed that although AMP claimed that its use of the\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started from 1984, apart from a table\n                    and random invoices that did not date beyond the year 2000, there was no\n                    “good evidence” that AMP’s magazine started selling in\n                    Singapore from 1984. The PAR also noted that the highest circulation of\n                    AMP’s magazine at 903 copies in Singapore was unimpressive and was a\n                    “number that [was] disproportionately low for the population of Singapore\n                    that [was] around 3 million at that time” (see [88] of the GD). The PAR\n                    then concluded that the circulation numbers however indicated that AMP had\n                    “some goodwill and reputation in Singapore”. Since the further\n                    point as to whether the goodwill rested in AMP or the distributor of its\n                    magazine was not argued before the PAR, he concluded that the goodwill should\n                    belong to AMP in the absence of any challenge (see [98] of the\n                GD). Misrepresentation 23     On misrepresentation, the PAR noted that the\n                    mere fact that a likelihood of confusion was found under s 8(2) TMA (see[18]–[19]above) did not automatically lead to the finding that there\n                    would be misrepresentation under passing off (see [99] of the GD); the element\n                    of misrepresentation “require[d] more than just a likelihood of confusion\n                    in the sense understood under trade mark law” (see [100] of the GD).\n                    Relying on his earlier observation (see[19]above) that there was no evidence that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” mark was a subsidiary or spin-off of AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark and that Ozone’s and AMP’s advertising\n                    retained their own special flavour, with no attempt to copy each other’s\n                    style, the PAR concluded that: 101    … This evidence also goes to show that\n                            there is clearly no misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt [by\n                            Ozone to try] to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                            goods. Damage 24     Having found that the second criteria of\n                    “misrepresentation” was not made out (see[23]above), the PAR then considered it “natural that\n                    there cannot be any case to damage that has occurred or that is likely to\n                    occur” (see [102] of the GD). However, the PAR also considered the\n                    alternative position where “confusing similarity” under\n                    s 8(2) TMA may be seen as a misrepresentation. In this aspect, he noted\n                    that he was unconvinced by AMP’s argument that its magazine was a\n                    “class publication” to prove damage: 103    … I am unconvinced that the mere mention\n                            [of or] association with [Ozone’s business] will bring about the\n                            ‘devastating’ damage that [AMP claims] will happen. The use\n                            of tattooed individuals and of vulgar words on a T-shirt design that\n                            will appear on the pages or cover of another magazine is too remote a\n                            cause that can be linked to the damage in the goodwill of [AMP’s]\n                            GLAMOUR magazine. 104    Further, I would think that advertisers are only\n                            likely to leave the magazine if the magazine itself is falling from\n                            being a ‘class publication’, and that is only if the\n                            magazine carrying the advertisements themselves are actively carrying\n                            out actions (to use the quoted examples, using heavily tattooed models\n                            and vulgar words) that will cause the magazine to be seen as a\n                            publication that is not a class publication. To say that advertisers\n                            will remove advertisements from one magazine because of the association\n                            of that one magazine with another offending publication, or because of\n                            the association of that one magazine with an offending entity is a\n                            tenuous argument, especially since the advertisers’ advertisement\n                            does not come anywhere near the offending publication. 105    In any event, I note that the ‘class\n                            publication’ principle originated from [AMP’s] own\n                            literature. There are also no other proofs of damage that were tendered\n                            before me. 25     Accordingly, the PAR concluded that because\n                    the elements of passing off were not made out, AMP’s ground of opposition\n                    under s 8(4) TMA failed. 26     Having set out the grounds for the PAR’s\n                    decision, I now proceed to summarise the parties’ main contentions in the\n                    appeal before me (see[27]–[28]below), before elaborating further on the\n                    parties’ arguments in my decision below.",
        "Ozone’s arguments on appeal": "27     Ozone raised five arguments to contend that\n                    the PAR had erred in holding that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was\n                    “confusingly similar” to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark pursuant to s 8(2)(b) TMA (see[10]–[19]above),viz, that the PAR had\n                    erred in: (a)     finding that its “HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” mark was conceptually similar to Ozone’s\n                        “GLAMOUR” mark (see[15]above); (b)     finding\n                        that its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was “similar”\n                        to Ozone’s “GLAMOUR” mark on the basis of conceptual\n                        similarityalone; (c)     not considering the lack of distinctiveness of\n                        AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR” mark (see[64]below); (d)     finding that Ozone’s goods,excluding“printed matter” (viz, “paper and cardboard; industrial\n                        packaging containers of paper; towels of paper; table napkins of paper; hand\n                        towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’\n                        chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners of paper; flags of\n                        paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic works; photographs,\n                        photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study materials”)\n                        were similar to AMP’s goods (viz,\n                        “magazines books and publications”) ( see[17]above); and (e)     finding that there was a likelihood of confusion\n                        between its “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s\n                        “GLAMOUR” word mark (see[18]–[19]above).",
        "AMP’s arguments on appeal": "28     On its end, AMP submitted that the PAR had not\n                    erred except in three respects,viz, that the PAR\n                    had erred in holding that: (a)     its “GLAMOUR” mark was\n                        notvisuallysimilar to Ozone’s\n                        ”HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark (see[13]above); (b)     its “GLAMOUR” word mark was notaurallysimilar to Ozone’s ”HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” word mark (see[14]above); and (c)     the\n                        law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the\n                        “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA (see[20]–[25]above).",

[emphasis added] 31     The abovementioned approach inFuture Enterprises,viz,\n                    that appeals from a decision of the PAR “are not in the nature of a\n                    rehearing,” however, differs from that stated in O 87 r 4(2) of\n                    the Rules of Court (Cap 322, R5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“ROC”), which\n                    applies to appeals against the decision of the Registrar of Trade Marks pursuant\n                    to s 75(2)(a) TMA. Counsel for both AMP and\n                    Ozone confirmed that the present application before me was made pursuant to\n                        s 75(2)(a) TMA read with O 87\n                    r 4(2) of the ROC. The latter provision states as follows: ORDER 87TRADE MARKS ACT…Appeals (O. 87, r. 4)4. —(1)…(2)An appeal shall be by way of\n                            rehearingand the evidence used on appeal shall be the\n                        same as that used before the Registrar and, except with the leave of\n                        the Court, no further evidence shall be given.[emphasis added]32     The Court of Appeal inFuture Enterprisesdidnotappear\n                    to have considered the effect of O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC.33     This apparent omission to consider O 87\n                    r 4(2) of the ROC was noted by Lee Seiu Kin J in the recent decision\n                    ofMediaCorp News Pte Ltd v Astro All Asia Networks\n                        PLC[2009] 4 SLR 496 (“MediaCorp”):26    … The Court of Appeal in Future Enterprises\n                            did not appear to have considered the effect of this provision.\n                            Nevertheless, the fact that such proceedings are “by way of\n                            rehearing” [as stated in O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC] does\n                            not necessarily mean that the appeal court’s decision is\n                            unfettered. An appeal from the High Court to the Court of Appeal is\n                            similarly by way of rehearing under O 57 r 3(1) of the ROC.\n                            However, the Court of Appeal will be slow to upset an exercise of\n                            discretion by the trial judge (Golden Shore Transportation Pte Ltd v UCO\n                            Bank [2004] 1 SLR 6 at [44]). Further, with respect to finding\n                            of facts, the Court of Appeal is generally reluctant to interfere\n                            because the trial judge is in a better position to assess the veracity\n                            and credibility of the witnesses (Seah Ting Soon trading as Sing Meng Co\n                            Wooden Cases Factory v Indonesian Tractors Co Pte Ltd [2001]\n                            1 SLR 521 at [22]).On the other hand, a\n                                distinction is drawn between perception of facts and evaluation of\n                                facts, the latter of which an appellate court is in as good a\n                                position as the trial court to make an evaluation from primary\n                                facts(Ho Soo Fong v Standard Chartered Bank [2007]\n                            2 SLR 181 at [20]).However the authorities\n                                are clear that the law pertaining to trade mark infringement is\n                                unique in that the final analysis is “more a matter of feel\n                                than science”(Future Enterprises at\n                        [7]).27Be that as it may, in view of the findings that I\n                            have made as set out below, it does not make a difference whether or not\n                            the appeal is to be by way of a rehearing. As mentioned\n                        earlier, MediaCorp proceeded only on two grounds in this appeal, viz\n                        ss 8(2)(b) and 8(3) [TMA], which I now turn to consider.[emphasis added]34     O 87 r 4(2) of the ROC was also\n                    covered by Chan Seng Onn J inValentino Globe BV v\n                        Pacific Rim Industries Inc[2009] 4 SLR 577 (which was\n                    subsequently affirmed by the Court of Appeal in Civil Appeal No 46 of 2009)\n                    although neitherFuture EnterprisesnorMediaCorpwas mentioned. Chan J said:9    Order 87\n                            rule 4(2) of the [ROC] provides that an appeal from the Registrar\n                            of Trade Marks shall be by way of “rehearing”. At\n                            para 87/3/7 of Singapore Civil Procedure 2007 (Sweet & Maxwell\n                            Asia, 2007 ) (“Singapore Civil Procedure”), it iterates\n                            that appeals to the court from the decision of the registrar [of trade\n                            marks] is governed inter alia, by O 55 and that the procedure is\n                            “by way of\n                            rehearing…”.10    On\n                            O 55 which governs appeals to the High Court from any court,\n                            tribunal or person, para 55/1/2 of Singapore Civil Procedure notes\n                            that O 55 r 2(1) stipulates that the appeal is by way of rehearing.\n                            Order 55, it suggests, confers upon the Court wider powers than those so\n                            conferred under O 53 which deals with, inter alia, judicial review.\n                            Hence, O 55 r 6(5) provides that the appellate court can make\n                            any order which should have been made by the tribunal. The appellate\n                            court is thus not confined to merely determining whether the decision\n                            below was compliant with rules of natural justice or reached honestly\n                            (Ling Uk Choon v Public Accountants Board [2004] 3 SLR 517 at\n                            [32]).11    “By way of\n                            rehearing” in my view means that the Court is not constrained to\n                            determine only whether the tribunal’s decision was proper and/or\n                            contained manifest errors of fact and law. If it wishes to, the Court in\n                            its discretion may consider the entire ream of evidence before it and\n                            venture beyond determining the propriety of the tribunal’s\n                            decision or inquiring into whether there had been manifest errors of\n                            fact or law. However, I do not think that it places an irrevocable\n                            burden upon the Courts to hear the matter anew so that the substantive\n                            merits fall to be determined afresh. As para 57/3/1 of Singapore\n                            Civil Procedure observes with regard to the phrase “by way of\n                            rehearing”, albeit in relation to appeals to the Court of\n                            Appeal:These words do not mean that the witnesses are heard afresh. They\n                            indicate the appeal is not limited to a consideration whether the\n                            misdirection, misreception of evidence or other alleged defect in the\n                            trial has taken place, so that a new trial should be ordered. They\n                            indicate that the court considers (so far as may be relevant) the whole\n                            of the evidence given in the court below and the whole course of the\n                            trial.…The courts’ power is therefore discretionary.[emphasis in original]35     Be that as it may, as inMediaCorp, in view of my findings as set out below, it would\n                    make no difference whether or not the appeal is to be by way of a rehearing. I\n                    now turn to examine the two grounds raised in this appeal,viz, ss 8(2)(b) and 8(4)\n                    TMA.AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) TMA36     To successfully oppose Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA, AMP must show that the following three conditions are\n                    satisfied in a “step-by-step” fashion (see the Court of\n                    Appeal’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In\n                        Department Store Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR 690\n                        (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                    (CA)”):(a)     that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR”\n                        word mark are similar (“Condition 1”);(b)ifCondition 1 is satisfied,thenthat\n                        Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark is to be registered\n                        for goods identical with or similar to those for which AMP’s earlier\n                        “GLAMOUR” word mark is protected (\n                        “Condition 2”); and(c)ifCondition 1andCondition 2 arebothsatisfied,thenthat there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by\n                        virtue of the similarity of the marks (ie,\n                        Condition 1) and of the goods (ie,\n                        Condition 2) (“Condition 3”).37     With respect to these three conditions, the\n                    following observations at [8] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)are instructive:8    … While we can see some link and overlap\n                            between the first and the third conditions, it is clear that they are\n                            different. The fact that a sign is similar to a registered mark does not\n                            automatically mean that there will be a likelihood of confusion on the\n                            part of the public. That is a question of fact to be determined by the\n                            court, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Moreover, the\n                            question of similarity is really a matter of degree. In a broad sort of\n                            sense, the greater the similarity between a mark and a sign, the greater\n                            will be the likelihood of confusion.However, if\n                                either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not\n                                be any need to go into the third question of determining whether\n                                there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean that if\n                                the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                                goods, that there will ipso facto be confusion in the minds of the\n                                public. If that was intended, s 27(2)(b) [see [15] ofThe\n                                Polo/Lauren Co (CA)where it was held that this approach\n                            also applied to s 8(2)(b) TMA] would\n                            have been phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.\n                            … [emphasis added]38     I now proceed to consider these respective\n                    conditions against the facts of this case in accordance with this\n                    framework.Condition 1: Similarity between the “HYSTERIC\n                GLAMOUR” and “GLAMOUR” word marks39     At the outset, it must be borne in mind that\n                    the word marks compared in this appeal were devoid of any stylisation,\n                    embellishment or device, and were as follows:Ozone’s word\n                                    markAMP’s word markHYSTERIC\n                                        GLAMOURGLAMOUR(1)   The approach to be adopted(A)   VISUAL, AURAL AND CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY40     As mentioned at[12]above, there are three aspects to similarity,viz, visual similarity, aural or phonetic similarity and\n                    conceptual similarity (seeThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [10]). Whether there is a similarity of marks in these three aspects of\n                    similarity is essentially a question of fact (seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR 1082 (“Johnson &\n                        Johnson”) at [9]). The law doesnothowever requireallthree\n                    similarities to be made out before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediaCorpat [32]). In this\n                    aspect, the observations of Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed,\n                    2009) (“Bently & Sherman”) at\n                    pp 863-866 are also apposite (footnotes omitted):Visual, aural and conceptual similarity. The\n                        marks should be assessed from the point of view of their visual, aural and\n                        conceptual similarities. Typically, tribunals consider\n                            each in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they\n                            have observed that a trade-off can occur: visual and conceptual\n                            differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities.…The relative importance of each sort of similarity will vary with the\n                        circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark.\n                        … Each case is therefore to be viewed in its own context. However,\n                        the ECJ has ruled [inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen\n                            Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2CMLR1343] that,in an appropriate\n                            case, mere aural similarity may make marks so similar as to be likely to\n                            cause confusion……In other situations, conceptual dissimilarity, as for\n                            example where one mark has a meaning but its comparator does not, may\n                            counteract aural or visual similarity.[emphasis added]41     A useful case in point is that ofMystery Drinks GmbH v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal\n                        Market (Trade Marks and Designs), Karlsberg Brauerei KG Weber\n                        Intervening[2004] ETMR 217 (which was cited with approval inJohnson & Johnsonat [13]), where\n                    “Mystery” was refused registration for non-alcoholic drinks as the\n                    mark “Mixery” had already been registered for beer.

[emphasis added]42     Accordingly, the relative importance of each\n                    type of similarity will thus vary with the circumstances in hand, in particular\n                    the goods and the types of mark. The fact that one type of similarity is made\n                    out doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. Also, regard should be had to thetypeof\n                    marks being compared (seeMediaCorpat\n                    [32]).(B)   DISTINCTIVENESS43     The distinctiveness in the earlier trade mark\n                        (ie, “GLAMOUR” in this case) is\n                    also one important factor in the inquiry into the similarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. In this vein, Ng-Loy Wee\n                    Loon inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singapore(Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2009) (“Law of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singapore”) observes as follows (footnotes\n                    omitted):Comparison between marks…[21.5.12]The distinctiveness in the earlier\n                        trade mark is one important factor.Where a common word\n                            is included in the earlier trade mark, the tribunal should be wary of\n                            granting a monopoly in its use. This translates into a reluctance to\n                            hold that two marks which contain a common word are similar\n                            marks.[emphasis added]44     The learned authors ofBently & Shermannote further at pp 866-868 (footnotes\n                    omitted):Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effectsFirst,the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the\n                            less literal or visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later\n                            mark is not similar. For example, the CFI comparing two words\n                        CASTELLANI and CASTERLLUCA for wine from the point of view of a German\n                        consumer found the two marks to be dissimilar, because the\n                        ‘castel’ element is a common descriptive component in wine names\n                        and the applicant’s suffix ‘luca’ would be seen as the\n                        Italian name and thus sufficient to differentiate the marks. InReed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ stated that‘where\n                            a mark is descriptive small differences may suffice to avoid\n                            confusion’, giving an illustration from the law of\n                        passing-off concerning the terms OFFICE CLEANING ASSOCIATION and OFFICE\n                        CLEANING SERVICES.Where the distinctiveness of the\n                            earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will have to be in close\n                            proximity for it to be similar, as with THERMAWEAR and\n                        THERMAWARM.The same principle applies to common names\n                            which intrinsically have a low level of\n                        distinctiveness.Second, if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then a mark that has\n                        been substantially modified might nonetheless still be similar.\n                        …[emphasis added]45     That this is the approach adopted in Singapore\n                    case-law can be seen from the High Court’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005]\n                    4 SLR 816 (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC)”):The similarity between the plaintiff’s marks and\n                            the defendant’s sign26    The decided cases suggest that there are three\n                            aspects to similarity: visual, aural or phonetic, and conceptual. In\n                            terms of visual similarity, it is clear that the mark and the sign share\n                            one common denominator: the word “POLO”.In cases where there is a common denominator, it is\n                                important to look at the differences between the mark and the sign\n                                in order to decide whether the challenged sign has been able to\n                                distinguish itself sufficiently and substantially:The European Limited v The Economist Newspapers\n                                Limited[1996] FSR 431 at 436; see alsoKerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names(Sweet & Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2001) at paras 16-63 to\n                            16-67...In other words, sometimes, looking at the\n                                challenged sign as a whole, the distinctiveness of the registered\n                                word mark is dissolved by the addition of the word. Accordingly, the\n                                similarity between the mark and the sign is significantly\n                                diminishedand may be insufficient to cause a likelihood\n                            of confusion.27In the present case, the\n                                differences are obvious: the addition of the word\n                                “PACIFIC” together with the sign’s different\n                                font and design. The question, then, is whether these differences\n                                are enough so as not to capture the distinctiveness of the\n                                registered mark. In order to decide this, I first have to consider\n                                whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to be so\n                                distinctive that the differences would not negate the\n                                similarity. This is an important issue because a more\n                            distinct mark generally receives greater protection:Premier Brands UK Ltd v Typhoon Europe Ltd[2000] FSR\n                            767 (“Premier Brands”).\n                            …28    …[I] am prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s\n                                word mark is somewhat distinctive but not strikingly so. As such,\n                                the differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the\n                                defendant’s sign are sufficient so that the latter does not\n                                capture the distinctiveness of the registered mark and is therefore\n                                not similar to the defendant’s mark.\n                            …[emphasis added]46     While the italicised words in [26] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(reproduced above at[45]) seem to suggest that the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into thelikelihood of confusion(as opposed tosimilarity between the marks: see[43]above), those in[27](viz, “I\n                    first have to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to\n                    be so distinctive that the differences would not negate thesimilarity” [emphasis added]\n                        and[28](viz, “the\n                    differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s sign\n                    are sufficient so that the latter does not capture the distinctiveness of the\n                    registered mark and is therefore notsimilarto\n                    the defendant’s mark”(emphasis added)) of the decision make it clear\n                        thatthe distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween\n                    the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.47     In any event, the Court of Appeal’s\n                    subsequent decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)does indicate that the distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor to be considered in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA and is not confined to the analysis of the\n                    likelihood of confusion:Similarity between the mark and the\n                        sign…23    …There was simply no evidence before the court to show\n                                that the word “polo” per se is distinctive.\n                            Indeed, the word “polo” is an ordinary English word\n                            meaning a game played on horseback…We\n                                recognise that some marks are inherently distinctive because they\n                                consist of inventive words without any notional or allusive\n                                quality. An example would be “Volvo”.“Polo” is certainly not an\n                                inventive word and could claim no inherent distinctiveness. Where\n                                common words are included in a registered mark, the courts should be\n                                wary of granting a monopoly in their use: seeThe European Limited v The Economist Newspaper\n                                Limited[1998] FSR 283 at 289–290 and\n                            “FRIGIKING” Trade Mark [1973] RPC 739 at 753.Any alleged distinctiveness must be acquired through use.\n                                Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                                light of all the circumstances of the case.\n                        ...24Bearing in mind that\n                                “polo” is a common English word, we are unable to see\n                                how it could be said that the sign “POLO PACIFIC” with\n                                its special font and design is similar to the mark\n                                “POLO” except in the broadest of sense that one word\n                                is common.

The\n                    average consumer only rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between\n                    the marks, and so must place his trust in the “imperfect picture of [the\n                    two marks] that he has kept in his mind” (Lloyd\n                        Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999]\n                    2 CMLR 1343, 1358-9). Accordingly, where at first glance two marks may\n                    appear to be dissimilar, when the possibility of imperfect recollection is taken\n                    into account, the two marks may in fact be similar (seeBently & Shermanat p 865). Hence, the court will not\n                    compare the two marks side by side and examine them in detail because\n                    “the person who is confused often makes comparison from memory removed in\n                    time and space from the marks” (Caterpillar Inc v Ong\n                        Eng Peng (formerly trading as Catplus International)[2006]\n                    2 SLR 669 at [55] per Tay Yong Kwang J). The court should also\n                    not take into account “any external added matter or circumstances”\n                    as the comparison is mark for mark.51     I have already set out at[13]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were visuallydissimilar. While the PAR’s statement by itself\n                    that:68    … the simple analysis in visual similarity\n                            is merely to look at the marks…isinaccurategiven that the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA must also necessarily consider, if any, the distinctive\n                    components of the marks (see[43]–[47]above), this\n                    was nevertheless done because the PAR also noted in the same paragraph\n                    that:68    … I do not think that the language\n                            represented by the letters [in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                            GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark]is so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                                any dominant element…[emphasis\n                        added]52     The PAR’s approach (viz, by looking at the word marksandconsidering whether the language represented by the letters\n                    in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                    any dominant element) was consistent with that adopted by the High Court inThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(see[45]above), which was affirmed on appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA).53     In the present instance, although the word\n                    marks of Ozone and AMP share one common denominator,viz, the word “GLAMOUR”, I agreed with the\n                    PAR’s observation that there were:… many visual differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                        mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has\n                        two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one.Furthermore, given that the word “HYSTERIC”, which\n                    appears at the beginning of Ozone’s word mark, is almost of equal length\n                    to the word “GLAMOUR”, I could not see how it would be entirely\n                    overlooked or overshadowed by the word “GLAMOUR”. That\n                    Ozone’s word mark has two words was to my mind a visual difference. Thus,\n                    even if “GLAMOUR” is the more common word of the two (ie, “HYSTERIC” and\n                    “GLAMOUR”) and may come to mind more quickly than\n                    “HYSTERIC”, the consumer with an imperfect recollection (see[50]above) would still remember that\n                    Ozone’s word mark has an additional word to “GLAMOUR”. In\n                    these circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that\n                    Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was visuallydissimilarto AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark.(3)   Aural similarity54     I have already set out at[14]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were aurallydissimilar. It is worth noting that inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1943) 60 RPC 87, Luxmoore LJ’s\n                    dissenting judgment stated, at 108:[t]he answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too\n                        nearly the sound of another …must nearly always depend on first impression,\n                        for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be\n                        deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has\n                        perhaps animperfect recollectionof it who is\n                        likely to be deceived or confused. [emphasis added]This statement was cited with approval in the House of Lords by\n                    Viscount Maugham inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1945)\n                    62 RPC 65 at 72.55     InBently &\n                        Shermanat p 865, the learned authors noted that:When comparing marks aurally, tribunals have tended to carry out a\n                        quantitative assessment: do the two signs have more syllables in common than\n                        not?In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR’s\n                    approach in dealing with the question of aural similarity was entirely\n                    consistent with the foregoing approach.56     In this case, both “HYSTERIC”\n                    and “GLAMOUR” were English words, although the latter could be\n                    said to be the more common English word. However, it must be borne in mind that\n                    Ozone’s word markstartswith the entirely\n                    separate word “HYSTERIC” preceding the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. Also, Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark would be read and pronounced as two separate and distinct words, in\n                    the order of “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”. AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark, on the other hand, would be read as a single\n                    word. The comparison in this case was between a two-word mark and a single word\n                    mark, so that even if the actual word “HYSTERIC” was forgotten, it\n                    would not be forgotten that there was an additional word in Ozone’s word\n                    mark. While I did not agree entirely with the reasons of the PAR, I also\n                    concluded that the words marks were aurallydissimilar.(4)   Conceptual similarity57     With regard to the requirement of conceptual\n                    similarity,Bently & Shermannote at\n                    p 866 (footnotes omitted):Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of the ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark.\n                        …AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark in the present case\n                    clearly relied on the orthodox meaning of “glamour”.58     In this instance, the PAR had held that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilar. Ozone contended that the PAR, who had found the word\n                    marks both visually and aurallydissimilar, had\n                    then subsequently erred in his finding that the word marks were similar on the\n                    basis of conceptual similarityalone. To this end,\n                    it referred to the following passage in the decision of the High Court inMcDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte\n                        Ltd[2004] 2 SLR 652 (McDonald’s (HC)) (an appeal against which was dismissed by\n                    the Court of Appeal inMcDonald’s\n                    (CA):43    As to the visual and\n                            aural similarities of the marks, I do not consider them to be\n                            confusingly similar. There are indeed significant visual differences\n                            between them – the depiction of an eagle as opposed to the golden\n                            arches forming the letter “M” – and aural\n                            differences – “McChicken”,\n                            “McNuggets”, “Egg McMuffin” and\n                            “Sausage McMuffin” compared to “MacTea”,\n                            “MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles”. Below the\n                            word component “MacTea”, for example, the legend\n                            “3-in-1 Instant Hot Tea” appears. Other than the letter\n                            “M” in “MacTea”, there is no mark similar to\n                            the opponents’ “M” logo anywhere on the packaging.\n                            The word marks are also different in appearance in terms of colour, font\n                            and typeface. The second and third syllables of the application marks\n                            are different in sound from the opponents’. The differences leave\n                            different impressions on people’s\n                            minds.44    Is there a conceptual\n                            link between the two in that the common use of the first syllable\n                            “Mac” or “Mc” means that both are likely to\n                            be taken as indicative of a common identity? The use of the first\n                            syllable “Mac” in the applicants’ range of products\n                            is not unlike the case of the opponents in that TWC has admitted to the\n                            use of the same naming system as McDonald’s. But it does not, in\n                            my view, override the other differences mentioned earlier and, when\n                            viewed as a whole,I do not believe there will be\n                                confusion between the rival marks. Having found the dissimilarity in\n                                the marks, visually and aurally, the common idea conveyed by\n                                competing marks is not overriding or determinative. InSports Cafe Ltd v Registrar of Trade\n                                Marks(1998) 42 IPR 552, the court at 557\n                            observed:[T]he fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only\n                            if the marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might\n                            then tip the balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is\n                            deceptive.[emphasis added]59     Reading the entire passage as a whole, it must\n                    be appreciated that the observation inMcDonald’s\n                        (HC)at [44] that:[h]aving found the dissimilarity in the marks, visually and aurally, the\n                        common idea conveyed by competing marks is not overriding or\n                        determinative.which wasprecededby the observation\n                    that:I do not believe there will be confusion between the rival marks.referred to conceptual similarity not being “overriding or\n                    determinative” of thelikelihood of\n                        confusionbetween the marks therein (ie, Condition 3: see [36(c)] above) andnotto whether the words marks weresimilar (ie, Condition 1: see\n                    [36(a)] above). In these circumstances, Ozone’s reading ofMcDonald’s (HC)was incorrect in that itconflatedCondition 1 and Condition 3, which\n                    as observed inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA), are\n                    separate conditions.60     The observation of the Australian Federal\n                    Court inSports Café Ltd v Registrar of Trade\n                        Marks(1998) 42 IPR 552 (“Sports\n                        Café”) at [557] that:… the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevantonlyif the marks themselves look or sound\n                        alike. [emphasis added]also merits closer scrutiny. This observation was made by the Federal\n                    Court inSports Caféafter reviewing an extract\n                    from the earlier decision ofCooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v\n                        Sigmund Pumps Ltd(1952) 86 CLR 536 (“Cooper Engineering”). InSports Café, the Federal Court stated at 556-557 that:The idea behind the markInCooper Engineeringthe application was\n                        for registration of the words “Rain King”. The\n                        opponent’s mark was RAINMASTER.…After pointing out the differences between the suffix\n                        “master” and the word “King” in appearance and\n                        sound [Dixon, William and Kitto JJ] continued (at 538-9):The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for\n                            the appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising\n                            from the two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or\n                            supremacy of the article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to\n                            falling rain or artificial rain as it was called during the argument.\n                            But it is obvious that trade marks, especially word marks, could be\n                            quite unlike and yet convey the same idea of the superiority or some\n                            particular suitability of an article for the work it was intended to do.\n                            To refuse an application for registration on this ground would be to\n                            give the proprietor of a registered trade mark a complete monopoly of\n                            all words conveying the same idea as his trade mark. The fact that two\n                            marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create a\n                            deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken\n                            into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or\n                            sounded alike were likely to deceive.Thus the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if\n                        the marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip\n                        the balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.61     I could not agree with the narrow approach inCooper Engineering. While I agreed that one\n                    should be slow to refuse registration of a mark simply on the basis of\n                    conceptual similarity alone, I was also of the view that it would be wrong to\n                    say that conceptual similarity would be relevant only if there was visual or\n                    aural similarity. As mentioned (at[42]above), the relative importance of each type of similarity must necessarily vary\n                    with the circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark\n                    being compared. The fact that one type of similarity is made out also doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. To adopt an overly generalised and restrictive principle that\n                    conceptual similarity isonlyrelevant to\n                    determining similarity between marks when either visual or aural similarity has\n                    been made out would be to ignore the fact that each aspect of similarity can\n                    vary in different degreesvis-à-viseach other\n                    depending on the circumstances, and trade-offs are entirely possible between the\n                    three aspects of similarity – for example, conceptual similarity can\n                    offset visual and aural dissimilarities. A similar approach was also adopted inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer & Co GmbH v Klijsen\n                        Handel BV[2000] FSR 77 (a decision which was followed by\n                    the High Court inRichemont International SA v Goldlion\n                        Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR 401) at\n                    84:28.    In order to assess the degree of similarity\n                            between the marks concerned, the nationalcourt must\n                                determine the degree of visual, aural or conceptual similarity\n                                between them and, where appropriate, evaluate the importance to be\n                                attached to those different elements, taking account of\n                            the category of goods or services in question and the circumstances in\n                            which they are marketed. [emphasis added]In these circumstances, I was of the view that, in this instance,\n                    despite the word marks being visually and aurally dissimilar, conceptual\n                    similarityneverthelessdeserved\n                    consideration.62     The PAR’s reasons for holding that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilarhave already been set out above at[15]. Against this, Ozone contended however that\n                    the two marks were conceptuallydissimilar. It\n                    pointed out that while the word “GLAMOUR” was defined in the\n                    onlineMerriam-Websterdictionary as “an\n                    exciting and often illusory and romantic attractiveness”, the usage of\n                    the word “HYSTERIC”, which was defined in theLongman Dictionary of the English Languageas “someone\n                    suffering from hysteria”, changed the complexion of the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. According to it, although the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” was still present in “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”,\n                    the concept had varied because one does not associate “HYSTERIC”\n                    with “GLAMOUR”. To support its position, it cited the case ofItochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9 (“Itochu”), where\n                    the marks under comparison were “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL”, as being “closely analogous” to the\n                    present factual matrix. In holding that these marks were conceptuallydissimilar, the PAR in that case made the following\n                    observations at [37]:37    Bearing in mind the Opponents’ argument that\n                            the average consumer normally perceives the mark as a whole without\n                            analysing its various details - a principle which has also been relied\n                            on by the Applicants - and that marks should not be compared side by\n                            side as marks are generally remembered by general impressions rather\n                            than by recollection of the whole;I find that there\n                                is no conceptual similarity between the Opponents’ and the\n                                Applicants’ marks. The Applicants’\n                                “SWEETCAMEL” mark does not convey the same idea and\n                                impression as the Opponents’ marks. The Opponents’\n                                “CAMEL” marks evoke the sense of ruggedness, adventure\n                                and masculinity whereas the Applicants’ mark which is preceded\n                                by the adjective “sweet” projects a totally opposite\n                                impression. [emphasis added]The decision inItochuwas upheld on\n                    appeal by the High Court.63     In the present instance, while the PAR was of\n                    the view that the word “HYSTERIC” did modify the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” to a “certain point”, the main concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” hadnotbeen\n                    “completely reversed” as inItochu.\n                    In this aspect, the PAR observed:70    … In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark\n                            still relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’,\n                            albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically\n                            glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold\n                            true; the concept of [Ozone] cannot be that the clothes do not look\n                            glamorous at all, otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their\n                            mark, which is to sell designed clothes at a premium\n                        price.71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is\n                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use\n                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to orthodox meaning\n                            of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it but\n                            still is based on ‘glamour’. ...64     I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s\n                    holding that the word marks in this case were “in some way” (as\n                    opposed to completely or to a large extent) conceptually similar. As Ozone\n                    conceded, the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still present in\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”.65     The inquiry however does not stop here. The\n                    distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark must also be\n                    considered at this stage.(5)   Distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word\n                mark66     In the present case, the PAR did not find\n                    it:72    … necessary to follow the principles\n                            [enunciated inThe European Ltd v The Economist\n                                Newspaper Ltd[1998] ETMR 307] of descriptive elements\n                            allowing closer similarity…because he was of the opinion that:… that principle in particular should only act as a[n] advanced\n                        argument in case the basic analyses do not reveal any clear result.67     This approach is howevercontraryto that set out above at[43]–[47]where the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.68     In these circumstances, I was of the view that\n                    the PAR had erred in failing to gofurtherafter\n                    considering the visual, aural and conceptual similarity of the word marks to\n                    consider the level of distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark in his inquiry into the similarity between the marks under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.69     In the present instance, there was no evidence\n                    before me to show that the word “GLAMOUR”, which is an ordinary\n                    English word (see[62]above) and not an\n                    inventive word, is inherently distinctive. The word “GLAMOUR”, the\n                    title of AMP’s magazine, in factdescribesthe very nature of the content in AMP’s magazine, which is described, on\n                    its website, as a magazine for young women interested in fashion, beauty and a\n                    contemporary lifestyle and which contains a number of photographs and\n                    advertisements displaying fashionable clothing and accessories. In my view, the\n                    word “GLAMOUR” isnotinherently\n                    distinctive.70     Has the word mark “GLAMOUR” then\n                    acquired distinctiveness through use in Singapore? To my mind, based on the\n                    limited and unsatisfactory evidence tendered by AMP which did little to support\n                    its claim that the “GLAMOUR” mark was extensively used in\n                    Singapore, this question must be answered in the negative. As evidence in\n                    support of its circulation figures between 1990 - 2002 (see [14] of the GD), AMP\n                    tenderednineinvoices from STP Distributors Pte\n                    Ltd dated:(a)10 March 2000 to “TIMES THE BOOKSHOP\n                            PTE LTD” at Centrepoint Shopping Centre (“TIMES”)\n                            showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(b)14 July 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of 40\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(c)8 September 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            40 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(d)24 August 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(e)7 September 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            50 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(f)26 October 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(g)18 January 2002 to a “COLD\n                            STORAGE” supermarket outlet showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(h)12 April 2002 to TIMES showing a sale\n                            of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines; and(i)13 September 2002 to TIMES showing a\n                            sale of 20 “GLAMOUR” magazines.71     It may readily be observed that these nine\n                    invoices related only to sales inspecificmonths\n                    in thelimitedperiod from 2000 to 2002. They did\n                    not reflect a monthly distribution from 1984 (the year AMP claimed its use of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started) and neither did they\n                    correspond to the total distribution figures submitted by AMP (see [14] of the\n                    GD). For example, although the invoice dated 24 August 2001 reflected only\n                    the sale of 30 copies of the September 2001 edition of the\n                    “GLAMOUR” magazine to TIMES, AMP claimed a distribution figure of\n                    823 in September 2001. The nine invoices adduced supported only a fraction of\n                    the distribution figures claimed by AMP. Furthermore, the nine invoices related\n                    only to the distribution of the “GLAMOUR” magazine toonebranch of TIMES (viz,\n                    the Centrepoint outlet) andasingle supermarket.\n                    There was nothing in evidence to support the promotion and/or subsequent sale of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” magazine to the Singapore public. In these\n                    circumstances, given the paucity of AMP’s evidence, I was of the view that\n                    it could not be said that the “GLAMOUR” mark had acquired\n                    distinctiveness through use in Singapore.72     AMP sought to argue, without raising any\n                    relevant authority, that its “GLAMOUR” word mark was distinctive\n                    by virtue of the fact that it was a registered trade mark under the Act. However\n                    such a line of argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA):23 …Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                        light of all the circumstances of the case. No authority has been cited to\n                        substantiate the assertion that the fact of registration is conclusive as to\n                        the distinctiveness of a mark. Neither does it follow that the incorporation\n                        of an entire registered word mark would automatically lead to infringement.\n                        …(6)   Conclusion on the overall similarity between the\n                marks73     Given my conclusion that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark was visually and aurallydissimilar, but conceptuallysimilar, and that “GLAMOUR” was merely descriptive\n                    and neither inherently distinctive nor distinctive by use, I was of the view\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. Strictly speaking,\n                    having arrived at this conclusion, it was not necessary, for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA to go on to consider\n                    Condition 2 (see [36(b)] above) and Condition 3 (see [36(c)] above).\n                    Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I shall do so.Condition 2: Similarity of goods74     With regard to this requirement, the learned\n                    authors ofBently & Shermannote at\n                    p 869:2.3.2 When are goods or services\n                        similar?The question of whether goods or services are similar depends on the facts\n                        of the case. When deciding whether a trade mark application falls foul of\n                        one of the relative grounds for refusal, the comparison is normally between\n                        the goods or services for which the earlier mark has been registered and the\n                        goods or services to which the application relates. …75     The relevant factors for assessing similarity\n                    of goods covered by Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and\n                    AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark are (seeBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd[1996] RPC\n                    281 (“British Sugar”) at\n                    296–297):(a)     the respective uses of the\n                        respective goods;(b)     the respective end users of the respective goods:(c)     the physical nature of the\n                        goods;(d)     the\n                        respective trade channels through which the goods reach the\n                    market;(e)     in the case\n                        of self-serve consumer items, whether in practice they are respectively\n                        found or likely to be found on the same or different shelves;\n                    and(f)     whether the\n                        respective goods are competitive or complementary. This inquiry may take\n                        into account how those in trade classify goods, for instance whether market\n                        research companies who act for industry put the goods or services in the\n                        same or different sectors.These factors were adopted inJohnson & Johnsonat [14] andMediaCorpat [41]. These factors need not all be\n                    satisfied before the goods can be treated as similar (Johnson\n                        & Johnsonat [18]).76     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanexplain at pp 869-870 (footnotes\n                    omitted) how these factors were applied inBritish Sugar\n                        vis-à-visa non-distinctive mark (as I had adjudged\n                    “GLAMOUR” to be (see[66]–[72]above)\n                    :[British Sugar] illustrates how the courts\n                        have applied the factors in the case of a non-distinctive mark (namely\n                        TREAT). There the question was whether a sweet syrup to be poured over\n                        desserts was similar to a sweet-flavoured spread. Jacob J concluded\n                        that the goods were not similar, explaining that the goods were used\n                        differently (the spread could be used on desserts but generally would not\n                        be); were not in direct competition; were located in different places in\n                        supermarkets (the spread with jams, the dessert sauce with desserts); were\n                        physically different (the spread was more viscous than the sauce); and were\n                        treated differently by market researches. In contrast inBalmoral Trade Mark[[1999] RPC 297,302], whisky and wine\n                        were held to be similar goods: although the two products have very different\n                        producers, it is common to find them being bought and sold by the same\n                        merchants, and sold through the same outlets.77     As noted above at[17], the PAR however saw no reason to decide along the lines of\n                    theBritish Sugarfactors (see[75]above) in coming to his conclusion\n                    that:… the scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (“Magazines, books and publications”)\n                        is clearly a sub-set of the goods of [Ozone] (in particular the mention of“printed matter”in the\n                        description of [Ozone’s] goods).[emphasis in original]78     The PAR had also referred to an apparent\n                    concession by Ozone that “there may be an overlap [between AMP’s\n                    goods and] the goods that [Ozone is] applying for”. For convenience, it\n                    would be useful to set out the nature of the parties’ respective\n                    goods:Ozone’s goods in\n                                        Class 16AMP’s goods in\n                                        Class 16Paper and cardboard;\n                                            industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                                            paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper;\n                                            handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’\n                                            chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners\n                                            of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags;printed matter; paintings and\n                                            calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;\n                                            playing cards; stationery and study\n                                        materialsMagazines,\n                                                books and\n                                    publicationsIn the course of the hearing before me, Ozone pointed out that its\n                    concession of an overlap with AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” wasonlylimited to\n                    “printed matter” and didnotextend\n                    to “paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels\n                    of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                    paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;\n                    banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic\n                    works; photographs, photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study\n                    materials” (“Ozone’s other goods”), which according\n                    to Ozone were “very different” from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone submitted that Ozone’s other goods could\n                    “be broadly classified into stationery, hygiene paper products\n                    labels/banners/blinds made of paper and photographs” and that applying\n                    theBritish Sugartest, Ozone’s other goods\n                    were different in function from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone contended that the parties’ respective target\n                    consumers were also different as people buying magazines would not be purchasing\n                    “stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper\n                    and photographs” as alternatives and accordingly the compared goods were\n                    not in competition.

I\n                    now move on to examine Condition 3.Condition 3: Likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                public81     As stated above at[37],evenwhere the marks are\n                    similarandthe goods are similar, this does not\n                    mean that there willipso factobe confusion in\n                    the mind of the public. There isnopresumption of\n                    confusion even where these two aspects of similarity are made out (The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [8]).82     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanelaborate at p 872 (footnotes omitted)\n                    as to what the public must be confused about:2.3.3 Likelihood of confusion…What must the public be confused about? The next question to consider is\n                        what is meant by ‘likelihood of confusion’ in [s 8(2)(b) TMA]?\n                        In its ‘classic form’,consumers must be\n                            confused about the source or origin of the goods or services –\n                            that is, they must be confused as to the designer, manufacturer,\n                            selector or supplier of the goods or services. In other words, classic\n                            confusion is concerned with the situation where consumers believe that\n                            the goods or services emanate from one organization, but they, in fact\n                            come from a different independent organization. This classic\n                        form of confusion has been extended to accommodate broader understandings of\n                        the source of goods or services. Consequently, aperson\n                            will be confused for the purposes of [s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                            assume that there is some broader kind of economic connection between\n                            the users of marks, for example, that the goods are being provided by a\n                            subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark owner.\n                        …In considering whether there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion, the tribunals must consider whether there is a genuine and\n                            properly substantiated likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that\n                            confusion is hypothetical and remote.

It seems to us that there will be infringement under that\n                            provision only if three conditions are present. First, the alleged\n                            offending sign must be shown to be similar to the registered mark.\n                            Second, both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar\n                            goods or services. Third, on account of the presence of the first two\n                            conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                            public. As the judge rightly pointed out, s 27(2)(b) does not make it an infringement if the\n                            likelihood of confusion is caused by some other factor. While we can see\n                            some link and overlap between the first and the third conditions, it is\n                            clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is similar to a\n                            registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a\n                            likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                            fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                            circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter\n                            of degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between\n                            a mark and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there\n                            will not be any need to go into the third question of determining\n                            whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean\n                            that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                            goods, that there willipso factobe\n                            confusion in the minds of the public. If that was intended,\n                                s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                            phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no presumption of\n                            confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.To determine the existence of confusion, the court is\n                                entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as the\n                                articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion:\n                                see Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd [1999]\n                                2 SLR 651 and McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises\n                                Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 177. While these two latter cases\n                                related to opposition proceedings under s 15 of the then Trade\n                                Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed), there is no reason why\n                                the concept of “likely to cause confusion” under that\n                                provision should be any different from the concept of\n                                “likelihood of confusion” under the present\n                                s 27(2)(b). As we see it, the global assessment test\n                            is likely to confound the final issue of confusion with the first two\n                            prerequisite conditions. Accordingly, we endorse theBritish Sugarapproach which was adopted by\n                            Lai J.[emphasis added]85     Ozone also referred to the decision of\n                    Kitchin J in the English High Court decision ofJulius\n                        Sämaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd[2006] FSR 42 (“Julius Säamaan”), which involved,inter alia, a trade mark infringement action. The\n                    relevant portion of the decision, at 872, reads:52    There is one further general principle which is\n                            important to have in mind at the outset in considering infringement. The\n                            court must consider the likelihood of confusion arising from the use by\n                            the defendant of the offending sign, discounting added matter or\n                            circumstances.If the sign and the mark are\n                                confusingly similar then the defendant cannot escape by showing that\n                                by something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his\n                                goods from those of the proprietor. In the present case\n                            this is important.Looking at the box in which the\n                                Christmas Tree product is sold, the use of the words “Lumber\n                                Jack Flashing air freshener” must be ignored, as must the\n                                particular circumstance in which the product is sold. The comparison\n                                to be made is between, on the one hand, the Tree marks and, on the\n                                other, the Christmas Tree product itself, and the picture of it\n                                which appears on the box. [emphasis added]86     As may be seen, the approach advocated inJulius Säamaanto determining the likelihood\n                    of confusion, which doesnotlook outside the\n                    marks, isdifferentfrom that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)which “look[s] outside\n                    the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                    likelihood of confusion”. This difference was in fact noted at [18]-[20]\n                    ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC), with reasons offered\n                    as to why the latter approach (ie, that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)) should be\n                    favoured:18    However, while the\n                            global assessment test should be rejected, I am equally uncomfortable\n                            with a strict adherence to old English jurisprudence. In particular,\n                            both parties appeared to agree thatthe test for the\n                                likelihood of confusion under this approach is an exceedingly narrow\n                                one. Once a mark is shown to offend, the user “cannot escape\n                                by showing that by something outside the actual mark itself he has\n                                distinguished his goods from those of the registered\n                                proprietor”: [Saville Perfumery\n                                Ld v June Perfect Ld and F W Woolworth & Co Ld(1941)\n                            58 RPC 147] ([11]supra) at 161.\n                            If this is a correct interpretation of the case, I would decline to\n                            follow this lead for the following\n                            reasons.19    Firstly, it is\n                            worthwhile to note that even the English cases appear to differ on\n                            whether this is the correct approach. InJune\n                                Perfectitself, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR, at\n                            161–162, went on to remark that the degree of similarity required\n                            for a likelihood of confusion to be caused depended on, for example, the\n                            goods in question. Where the customers of the goods in question were not\n                            the sort who would be too careful about the details of the mark and\n                            would only remember some distinguishing feature, it would require very\n                            little for the likelihood of confusion to be caused. If, on the other\n                            hand, this is not the case, then it would require “nothing short\n                            of a degree of resemblance apparent to the eye” for there to\n                            exist a likelihood of confusion. Thus, the court is allowed to look\n                            outside the marks in order to assess how similar the marks must be for\n                            there to exist a likelihood of confusion.Origins\n                                Natural Resources Inc v Origin Clothing Limited[1995]\n                            FSR 280 (“Origins”) is of no\n                            use because the remark there that external added matter or circumstances\n                            should be discounted was made in relation to the defendant’s claim\n                            that since it and the plaintiff were trading in different markets and in\n                            different countries, the likelihood of confusion could never arise.\n                            Jacob J, in that case, rightly held that the courts must assume\n                            that the mark would be used in a normal and fair manner. Plaintiffs do\n                            not need to show that there is actual confusion:Compass Publishing BV v Compass Logistics Ltd[2004] RPC 41;In the matter of an\n                                Application by Edward Hack for the Registration of a Trade Mark\n                                (1941) 58 RPC 91. It is also important to note\n                            that in both these cases, there was no discussion of an earlier case,In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist\n                                Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 (“thePianotistcase”), which was affirmed inSime Darby\n                                Edible Products Ltd v Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 360 (“Sime\n                                Darby”). In thePianotistcase, Parker J, at 777, having reviewed\n                            the decisions that came before, summarised the position of the law as\n                            such:You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their\n                            look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are\n                            to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who\n                            would be likely to buy those goods. … If,considering all those circumstances, you come to the\n                            conclusion that there will be a confusion … then you must refuse\n                            the registration in that case. [emphasis added]InWagamama([11]supra), the court also did not consider thePianotistcase. Nonetheless, Laddie J\n                        was equivocal about whether the court was to find a likelihood of confusion\n                        notwithstanding that the alleged infringer had taken steps to differentiate\n                        his products from the plaintiff’s. For instance, he remarked, at\n                        720–721, that:If … the marks were too similar,usuallyinfringement would be found even if in the\n                            market place the infringer took steps to prevent confusion in fact\n                            occurring ... To this extent therefore,a registered\n                                trade mark created a monopoly which might sometimes go beyond what\n                                was strictly necessary to protect the proprietor’s goods and\n                                his reputation. [emphasis added]I am in agreement with this observation.The protection\n                            that the law offers to a registered proprietor of a trade mark is wide\n                            but it is not infinite. The ambit of that protection should be guided by\n                            the underlying aim of a trade marks regime, which is to ensure that\n                            consumers do not confuse the trade source of one product with another.\n                            For instance, where the consideration of other matters can assist the\n                            court in drawing the line at cases where the likelihood of confusion is\n                            merely imaginary, there is no reason not to do so. Otherwise, the law\n                            will end up extending protection where none is needed.20    Secondly, the\n                            Singapore cases deciding on the question of the likelihood of confusion,\n                            although mostly involving an opposition to the registration of a sign,\n                            have been much clearer and more consistent in allowing the consideration\n                            of these extraneous factors. InSime\n                            Darby, Lim Teong Qwee JC quoted and applied\n                            Parker J’s summation of the law on the issue of confusion\n                            which I quoted at [19] above. InKellogg Co v Pacific\n                                Food Products Sdn Bhd[1999] 2 SLR 651\n                                (“Kellogg”), the Court\n                            of Appeal considered an opposition to the registration of a mark under\n                            s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). It\n                            was held, at [30] and [33],that the likelihood of confusion was to be\n                            determined on the basis of several factors, including the actual use of\n                            the mark, the reputation of the earlier mark and the packaging of the\n                            goods. More recently, in [McDonald’s\n                                (CA)] ([14]supra), the\n                            Court of Appeal held, at [66], that:[T]he question whether a proposed mark will likely give rise to\n                            confusion on account of some similarity with an existing mark is a\n                            question of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. Besides\n                            comparing the marks, also germane are the extent of the reputation of\n                            the existing mark, how the proposed mark is to be used, the nature of\n                            the goods to which the mark will be put, how the goods are to be sold\n                            and who the target customers are: seeIn the Matter\n                                of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ltd(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 at 777. Obviously, these considerations are not\n                            exhaustive.I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s submission that these cases\n                        should be distinguished simply because they dealt with unregistered marks.\n                        Under the relevant statute being considered by the courts in those cases was\n                        a requirement of the mark being “likely to deceive or cause\n                        confusion”. Surely it cannot be argued that this is any different\n                        than the requirement of a “likelihood of confusion” under\n                            s 27(2)(b) of the current TMA.21    Finally,turning to the plain\n                                words of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I find that a proper\n                                construction of the provision does not reject the court’s\n                                discretion in assessing so-called extraneous factors when deciding\n                                whether there is a likelihood of confusion. The only thing that the\n                                statute calls for is that the likelihood of confusion arises from\n                                the similarity. But where the user of a potentially infringing sign\n                                has taken pains to distinguish his products from the registered\n                                proprietor’s good[sic]and services, the effect may be\n                                that the likelihood of confusion, if any, is merely hypothetical or\n                                speculative. This is significant because unlike\n                            s 27(1) TMA, s 27(2)(b) does not\n                            presume that there is a likelihood of confusion. If there is no\n                            likelihood of confusion, there can be no infringement:Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd[2003]\n                            4 SLR 755 at [12]. Section 27(2)(b) TMAalso does not forbid the court\n                                taking into account various factors in deciding the degree of\n                                similarity required in order to find that there exists a likelihood\n                                of confusion.22    Having reviewed the cases, and confining myself\n                            strictly to what is required to decide the present case, I am of the\n                            opinion thatthere are two ways in which factors\n                                extraneous to the mark come into play. One is to establish the\n                                strength of the similarity required in order to decide the question\n                                of whether there exists a likelihood of confusion.\n                            …The court cannot know what degree of similarity causes\n                            confusion unless it is able to assess, for instance, the trading\n                            circumstances of the goods in question and therefore the standard of\n                            care that the ordinary consumer will exercise in that particular case.\n                            The other is this. Where the court finds that there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion by reason of the similarity, the court must go on and enquire\n                            whether this likelihood is a real one or whether it is merely\n                            speculative or hypothetical. Where the infringer has taken sufficient\n                            steps to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s such that the\n                            likelihood of confusion becomes a mere possibility, there is no\n                            infringement. Of course, there is no need for plaintiffs to\n                        demonstrate that there is actual confusion. However, the courts are not to\n                        hold that there is a likelihood of confusion on the basis of “highly\n                        speculative eventuality”:McDonald’s, at [59]…[emphasis added]87     AlthoughThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)was a trade markinfringementaction under s 27(2)(b) TMA, the Court of\n                    Appeal in that case was of the view that s 8(2)(b) of the TMA should besimilarlyconstrued:15    It is of interest to\n                            comparePolo Textilewith10 Royal Berkshire Polo Club Trade Mark[2001] RPC 32 (“Royal\n                                Berkshire”) where an application to register the\n                            mark “10 Royal Berkshire POLO CLUB” was opposed by\n                            the same party as the appellant in the present case. The relevant\n                            English statutory provision read:A trade mark shall not be registered if because —…(b)    it is similar to an earlier trade mark and\n                                    is to be registered for goods or services identical with or\n                                    similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is\n                                    protected,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,\n                            which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade\n                            mark.It would be noted that the material part of the wording of this English\n                        provision (except for the last phrase “which includes the likelihood\n                        of association with the earlier trade mark”) is identical to our\n                        s 8(2) of the Act. It is also similar to our s 27(2)(b) (except again for the last phrase).Of course, this English provision (as our s 8(2)) relates\n                            to refusing the registration of a mark, rather than the infringement of\n                            an existing mark. However, we do not think this distinction should mean\n                            that the meaning to be given to s 27(2)(b) should be any different\n                            from that ascribed to s 8(2) or the equivalent English provision\n                            considered in Royal Berkshire. In addition, we also do not\n                        think that the inclusion of the ending phrase in the English provision in\n                        any way enlarges its meaning. Confusion as to trade origin is already\n                        encompassed in the earlier part of the provision: see Christopher Morcom,\n                        Ashley Roughton & James Graham,The Modern Law of\n                            Trade Marks(Butterworths, 1999 Ed) at\n                        p 208.[emphasis added]Nevertheless, where, as in the present case, there was not much\n                    evidence as to how Ozone intends to apply its mark or to distinguish its goods\n                    from AMP’s in Singapore, the consideration of factors other than the marks\n                    themselves would be limited, although the consideration of other factors was in\n                    principle permissible.88     In the course of the hearing before me, AMP\n                    produced a copy of a magazine, which was a “25th anniversary book”\n                    bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark, which had been purchased\n                    from a bookstore in Singapore in September 2009. However, in my view, this\n                    itself did not constitute much evidence about Ozone’s intentions in\n                    Singapore with its mark.89     As stated above at[19], the PAR had identified the relevant segment of the public\n                    to be “the entire group of women who read magazines for leisure and [who]\n                    are fashion conscious.” I agreed with this classification. However, I\n                    would add that as noted at [36] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC):The likelihood of confusion…36    The average consumer in Singapore has been\n                            described asliterate, educated, exposed to the world\n                                and unlikely to be easily hoodwinked: (Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte\n                                Ltd[1991] SLR 133]([23]supra) at 143–144, [30]; and [McDonald’s(CA)] at\n                            [64]. This is the starting point. [emphasis added]90     Furthermore, in the context of the average\n                    consumerof magazinesand their purchasing habits,\n                    it has been noted inIn the Matter of Application No 2136517A\n                        in the name of IPC Magazines Limited to register a trade mark in Classes 9,\n                        16 & 35 and In the Matter of Opposition thereto under No 50532 by\n                        Liberty Media for Women LLC[note: 2]that:36. Magazines are primarily obtained by self-selection, which makes the\n                        visual appearance of the title (or trade mark) of primary importance. They\n                        are usually displayed alongside other magazines, grouped according to\n                        subject matter. It is possible that a women’s magazine could be\n                        displayed alongside, or in the proximity of one for teenagers and young\n                        women, which would afford a side-by-side comparison. I cannot, however say\n                        that that would necessarily be the case, particularly in circumstances where\n                        the magazine is obtained by subscription. There are circumstances when oral\n                        use, such as a consumer making an enquiry regarding the availability of a\n                        publication will be of relevance.Although magazines are\n                            relatively inexpensive items, the consumer is, I consider, reasonably\n                            discerning in the selection, where able, often picking up the magazine\n                            to glance through its contents prior to making the decision to\n                            purchase. [emphasis added]91     In these circumstances, given my conclusion\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA (see[73]above), and bearing in mind the\n                    characteristics of the average consumer who would be likely to buy the goods of\n                    Ozone and AMP (see[82]-[83]and[89]above) and who would “exercise some care and good sense in making his\n                    purchases” (see[83]above), I was of\n                    the view that even for “printed matter”, let alone Ozone’s\n                    other goods, the ordinary Singaporean would have little difficulty discerning\n                    that Ozone’s goods bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark are\n                    not from the same trade source or origin as AMP’s goods bearing the\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark. In this aspect, it would be useful to refer toIn the Matter of Application No 1568121 in the name of\n                        Global Spa and in the matter of Opposition thereto under No 45679 in the\n                        name of Advance Magazine Publishers Inc.[note: 3]Here,\n                    the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office Hearing Officer, adopting a\n                    similar stance, observed as follows:Titles of magazines by their nature tend to make\n                            varying degrees of reference to their subject matter or target\n                            readership, and consequently many have a low level of distinctiveness.\n                            The word GLAMOUR is no exception. It is an ordinary and well known word\n                            in the English language which readily conveys the idea of clothing,\n                            make-up, etc, and given that the opponents say that their magazine sold\n                            under the GLAMOUR trade mark is well known for its features relating to\n                            fashion and related topics I consider that it falls into the category of\n                            a mark with a low degree of distinctiveness. I make this\n                        observation only insofar as to say that as it isnot the\n                            strongest of marks this is likely to impact on customer perception of\n                            the mark and the issue of confusion. [emphasis added]I should add that this observation was made even though the opponents\n                    in that case, AMP, had claimed, as in this case (see[7]above), that the “GLAMOUR” mark had been\n                    registered in several other countries. Furthermore, it bears mention also that,\n                    as stated at paras 10 and 11 of the statutory declaration declared in Japan on\n                    5 December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani (see[8]above), that AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Printed matter (magazines, newsletters and books; computer programs);\n                        paper products (posters, paper patterns)and Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                        paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                        paper patterns; tailors’ chalk, table cloths of paper; blinds of\n                        paper; banners of papers; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter;\n                        paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing\n                        cards; stationery and study materialshave in factco-existedon the United\n                    Kingdom Trade Marks Register since 2001.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA92     For all the foregoing reasons, I was thus of\n                    the view that AMP’s opposition to the registration of Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 pursuant to\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA shouldnotsucceed. The PAR’s decision on this provision was\n                    accordinglyreversed. I now proceed to examine\n                    AMP’s opposition pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA93     As stated above at[28], AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding that the\n                    law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.94     It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an\n                    action for passing off, it had to prove the following classical trinity of\n                    elements,viz:(a)     a goodwill or reputation attached to\n                        the goods and services it supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by\n                        association with the identifying “get-up”, such that the\n                        “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive\n                        specifically of AMP’s goods or services;(b)     a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public\n                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe\n                        that the goods offered by Ozone are the goods of AMP; and(c)     that it is likely to suffer damage by\n                        reason of the erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation\n                        that the source of its goods is the same as the source of those offered by\n                        AMP.(See the decisions of the Court of Appeal inNovelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009]\n                        3 SLR 216 (“Amanresorts”) at [36]-[37] andCity\n                            Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2009]\n                        SGCA 53 (“City Chain”)). As\n                        these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see[21]above), I needed only to examine whether\n                        the PAR had erred inapplyingthese three\n                        elements to the facts of the present case.Element 1: Goodwill or reputation95     In the submissions before me, goodwill and\n                    reputation were referred to interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer\n                    to goodwill only. The two essential features of goodwill, which is a question of\n                    fact, were summarised recently inCity Chainas\n                    follows:62 In [Amanresorts] at [39], this court held\n                        thatthe two essential features of goodwill are that\n                            “it is the association of a good, service or business on which\n                            the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been\n                            applied with a particular source” and “this association is\n                            an ‘attractive force which brings in custom’”.\n                            Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a question of fact. Relevant\n                            factors include advertising, trading, volume of sales, and whether it\n                            has been registered. But the fact that the mark or indicia is\n                        not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the\n                        plaintiff’s goods or services (seeHalsbury Laws of\n                            Singaporevol 13(3) (LexisNexis Singapore) at\n                        para 160.8172007). [emphasis added]96     It bears mention that where a case involves\n                    indicia which aredescriptiveof the goods or\n                    services in question (as in this case: see[69]above), the law imposes ahigherburden on the plaintiff (ie, AMP) when proving the existence of his goodwill. The leading\n                    decision in this aspect is that of the Court of Appeal inLifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99 SHOP)[2000] 2 SLR 766 (“Lifestyle\n                    1.99”). The facts of and principles stated in that case have\n                    been helpfully summarised inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat p 209 as follows:[17.1.15]… The plaintiff was the\n                        owner of a chain of retail shops which operate under the markONE.99 SHOP. These outlets sold goods ranging from\n                        snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and\n                        common household items. The important characteristic of the\n                        plaintiff’s business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99.\n                        The plaintiff was the first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price\n                        store’ business. About 1-½ years later, the defendant opened its\n                        retail outlets under the markLifestyle 1.99,\n                        selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to\n                        S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the\n                        markONE.99 SHOP, the Court of Appeal laid\n                        down the legal principles as follows:(a)    The law treats quite differently the mark of a\n                            business depending on whether the mark is descriptive or\n                            ‘fancy’.(b)    A mark which isprima\n                                faciedescriptive will only be protected if it can be\n                            shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it\n                            has becomes distinctive of the plaintiff’s business.\n                            ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the law of passing off. In\n                            relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes the goods of the\n                            plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders.(c)    The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean\n                            that it cannot become distinctive, although it would be difficult to\n                            prove. A very great burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove that the\n                            mark has acquired a secondary meaning.…97     In a similar vein, inJohnson & Johnson, where the registered mark was\n                    “Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was\n                    “Careree”, the court noted:24In regard to goodwill, it must\n                                [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a descriptive\n                                word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become\n                                associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to\n                                claim a monopoly of descriptive words: seeNippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paint (Singapore)\n                                Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 1 andSuper Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte\n                                Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in\n                            appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have\n                            taken on a “secondary meaning” or become\n                            “distinctive in fact”. An example is\n                            “Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that\n                            sells clothes for pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis\n                            added]98     In the present case, bearing in mind thegreaterburden of proof on AMP (in light of my\n                    earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely\n                    descriptive: see[69]above), I was of the\n                    view that the PAR haderredin concluding that\n                    there was goodwill (see[22]above). Given\n                    the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of\n                    sales (viz, the nine invoices: see[70]above) as elaborated above at[71]and the lack of evidence ofanypromotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in\n                    Singapore, it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has\n                    acquired a “secondary meaning”. As the PAR observed:88    [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from\n                            1984, but there does not seem to be good evidence that the magazines\n                            started selling in Singapore from that time, only a table and random\n                            invoices that do not date beyond the year 2000. [Ozone states] that the\n                            circulation numbers for Singapore are not impressive, 903 copies at its\n                            highest only. The Opponents have submitted that this is high relative to\n                            the numbers of other publications that are sold, as evidenced by the\n                            invoices from their distributors.However, the number\n                                903 copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low\n                                for the population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that\n                                time.…93    … [T]he circulation\n                                numbers in Singapore are unimpressive, and there is no advertising\n                                in Singapore to increase its recognition of [AMP’s]\n                                marks. [emphasis added]99     The paucity of evidence in the present case\n                    must be contrasted with the ample evidence inLifestyle\n                        1.99of the plaintiff’s goodwill. As stated inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    pp 210-211:[17.1.18]    In [Lifestyle 1.99], the plaintiff succeeded in\n                            discharging this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with\n                            the plaintiff’s sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of\n                            operation was substantial in the light of the very low price of each\n                            item), the extensive advertisements and media coverage on the\n                            plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of the people\n                            surveyed were aware or had heard of theOne.99\n                                Shopand at least 40% knew where the outlets were\n                            located. The court found that all this evidence pointed to some goodwill\n                            in the plaintiff’s business. …100    In these circumstances, I was of the view\n                    that AMP had failed to establish the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In\n                    the light of this conclusion, there was no need for me to set out my views on\n                    the second element of misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so\n                    for the sake of completeness.Element 2: Misrepresentation101    With regard to the element of\n                    misrepresentation, the learned author ofLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporenotes at p 225 (footnotes\n                    omitted):[18.0.1]The key element here is deception.\n                        The court is concerned with the following question:has\n                            the defendant made a false representation that led to, or is likely to\n                            lead, to deception or confusion amongst the public? The nature of the\n                            deception or confusion may relate to the trade source of the goods or\n                            services, or to the quality of the goods or services.\n                            …[18.0.2]Although the key element is deception, it is not\n                            necessary to prove that the defendant has an intention to deceive or\n                            mislead the public. For this reason, it has been said thatthe state of the mind of the defendant is immaterial;\n                            rather, what matters is the impact on the persons to whom the\n                            misrepresentation is addressed. If the impact on these\n                        persons is such that they would be deceived, the element of\n                        misrepresentation is made out and the defendant cannot avoid a finding of\n                        passing off by the mere fact that his goods are of as good or better quality\n                        than the plaintiff’s, or that the misrepresentation was made\n                        innocently.[emphasis added]102    It would also be useful to refer toAmanresortswhich confirms that confusion is\n                    an essential element of the tort of passing off. As stated in the\n                    headnote:(4)    On the issue of misrepresentation, thetarget audience of misrepresentation in a passing off\n                                action was the actual and potential audience of the claimant.\n                                Misrepresentation was actionable only if it caused confusion and\n                                while there was no need to showactualconfusion, the court had to assess whether there was alikelihoodof confusion from the surrounding facts,\n                                based on the average reasonable person, with characteristics\n                                reflective of the relevant section of the public.\n                            Relevant factors in this case included whether there was any fraudulent\n                            intention in using the name “Amanusa” for the housing\n                            project, and whether the business of the Appellant and the Respondents\n                            were in the same field or closely related fields. The identical\n                            names, the similar Balinese themes, and the presentation of the\n                            Appellant’s housing project as high-quality accommodation were\n                            factors increasing the likelihood of confusion… [emphasis\n                            added]103    Be that as it may, where adescriptivemark is adopted by a plaintiff, aslightdifference between the plaintiff’s mark and\n                    the defendant’s mark is sufficient to distinguish them and to undo any\n                    possibility of confusion in the mark (seeLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat p 211, para 17.1.18, andLifestyle 1.99at [39]).104    In the present case, the PAR had concluded\n                    that there was no misrepresentation because Ozone was not attempting to\n                    “mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                    goods”:101    In the present case, I have made the decision that\n                            the marks are confusingly similar for the purposes of Section 8(2).\n                            However, in paragraph 78 above, I had described that it does not appear\n                            to me, on the evidence, that there is any effort to imply that the\n                            Applicants’ mark is a spin-off mark. Each of [Ozone’s] and\n                            [AMP’s] advertising retain its own special flavour, with no\n                            attempt to copy each other’s style.This\n                                evidence also goes to show that there is clearly no\n                                misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt where [Ozone is]\n                                trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                                goods. [emphasis added]105    The PAR had made his ultimate finding that\n                    there was no misrepresentation on the basis that there was no attempt on the\n                    part of Ozone to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.\n                    This basis of the PAR’s conclusion was incorrect because with regard to\n                    the element of misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the\n                    effect of Ozone’s conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see[102]above) and there can be a\n                    misrepresentation even if it was madeinnocently(seeJohnson & Johnsonat [25]). On the other\n                    hand, Ozone’s state of mind would have been a relevant consideration in\n                    finding an increased likelihood of confusion if Ozone had been found (there was\n                    no evidence of this in this case) to have had an intention to mislead or\n                    deceive. As noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat pp 230-231:[18.4.6]Proof of an intention to deceive is\n                        not a necessary ingredient in this second element, but if such an intention\n                        is established, the burden on the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened.\n                        …106    AMP contended that the PAR had\n                    “committed a further material error of principle by restricting his\n                    analysis to whether there was any confusion…to the origin of the goods as\n                    evident from his conclusion that `there is no attempt where [Ozone was] trying\n                    to mislead or deceive the public as to theorigin of the\n                        goods’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the\n                    “PAR’s restriction of the analysis as such defies established law\n                    that confusion under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to\n                    the origin of [Ozone’s] goods”.107    I accepted thegeneralprinciple that the nature of the confusion may relate to\n                    the trade source of the goods or servicesorto\n                    the quality of the goods. As stated inLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat pp 226-228:18.2MISREPRESENTATION AS TO ORIGIN[18.2.1]The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to\n                            the trade source of the goods or services, or to the quality of the\n                            goods or services. Misrepresentation as to the trade source can take the\n                            form of a false representation that the defendant’s goods or\n                            services are those of the plaintiff, or that the two parties are\n                            connected in some way, for example, the defendant’s business is an\n                            extension, branch or other agency of the\n                        plaintiff’s.…18.3MISREPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY[18.3.1]Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of\n                            the goods or services is an element of misrepresentation about the\n                            quality of the goods or services. The consumer buying the\n                            defendant’s goods thinks that he is getting the quality that he is\n                            accustomed to finding in the plaintiff’s goods. Here\n                        the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation about thequality of his own goods.[18.3.2]It is also possible for the\n                        defendant to make a misrepresentation about the quality of theplaintiff’sgoods…[emphasis added]108    At[96]above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia which was\n                    descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on AMP in\n                    proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof isalsoextended to the element of misrepresentation, as\n                    noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat pp 230-231:18.4PROVING MISREPRESENTATION…[18.4.7]When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive\n                            connotations or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears\n                            a higher burden of proof to show goodwill is extended to the second\n                            element: the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show confusion is also\n                            heavier. The courts will readily regard a slight difference between the\n                            plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark as being\n                            sufficient to distinguish them. [Lifestyle\n                            1.99] is a classic illustration of this principle. …\n                        [emphasis added]109    In my view, it was clear however that\n                    contrary to AMP’s contention (see[106]above), the PAR hadnotrestricted his analysis to only whether there was any confusion to the origin of\n                    the goods but had also considered and rejected AMP’s argument that there\n                    had been a misrepresentation as to quality, albeit in the context of the third\n                    element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the GD cited at[24]above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of\n                    proof on the shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was\n                    of the opinion that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now\n                    move on to consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade\n                    source of the goods.110    In this case, while I accepted that the\n                    proximity of a defendant’s field of activity to a plaintiff’s is a\n                    relevant consideration in deciding whether there is likelihood of confusion (seeLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    p 231, para 18.4.8 andAmanresortsat para\n                    84), and that there wassomeproximity between\n                    Ozone’s field of activity (viz, the design\n                    and retailing offashionapparel andfashionaccessories for both men and women: see[8]above) and AMP’s field of\n                    activity (viz, the “GLAMOUR” mark\n                    primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine\n                    which is devoted to the reporting and portraying of,inter\n                        alia, contemporary women’sfashionand beauty: see[7]above) in that both relate to “fashion”, given that:(a)     the word marks of Ozone and AMP\n                        were visuallydissimilar(see[53]above) and aurallydissimilar(see[56]above);(b)     “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive andnotinherently distinctive nor distinctive by use (see[73]above);(c)     a higher burden of proof is imposed\n                        on AMP (see[108]above);\n                    and(d)     Ozone’s\n                        other goods weredifferentfrom AMP’s\n                        goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                        publications”) (see[80]above),I was of the opinion that the element of\n                    misrepresentation was also not satisfiedvis-à-visOzone’s other goods.111    With regard to “printed\n                    matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an overlap between\n                    “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the\n                    view that, on balance, the element of misrepresentation was also not made\n                    out.Element 3: Damage112    With regard to the element relating to the\n                    question of damage, this was accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were\n                    made out.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4)\n                TMA113    For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no\n                    reason to disturb the PAR’s eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of\n                    opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not made out and must fail.Conclusion114    Given my conclusion that AMP’s\n                    opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(b)and 8(4)\n                    TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s\n                    decision dated 16 March 2009.

        "AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b) TMA": "36     To successfully oppose Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA, AMP must show that the following three conditions are\n                    satisfied in a “step-by-step” fashion (see the Court of\n                    Appeal’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In\n                        Department Store Pte Ltd[2006] 2 SLR 690\n                        (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                    (CA)”): (a)     that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                        GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s earlier “GLAMOUR”\n                        word mark are similar (“Condition 1”); (b)ifCondition 1 is satisfied,thenthat\n                        Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark is to be registered\n                        for goods identical with or similar to those for which AMP’s earlier\n                        “GLAMOUR” word mark is protected (\n                        “Condition 2”); and (c)ifCondition 1andCondition 2 arebothsatisfied,thenthat there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public by\n                        virtue of the similarity of the marks (ie,\n                        Condition 1) and of the goods (ie,\n                        Condition 2) (“Condition 3”). 37     With respect to these three conditions, the\n                    following observations at [8] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)are instructive: 8    … While we can see some link and overlap\n                            between the first and the third conditions, it is clear that they are\n                            different. The fact that a sign is similar to a registered mark does not\n                            automatically mean that there will be a likelihood of confusion on the\n                            part of the public. That is a question of fact to be determined by the\n                            court, taking into account all the relevant circumstances. Moreover, the\n                            question of similarity is really a matter of degree. In a broad sort of\n                            sense, the greater the similarity between a mark and a sign, the greater\n                            will be the likelihood of confusion.However, if\n                                either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there will not\n                                be any need to go into the third question of determining whether\n                                there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean that if\n                                the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                                goods, that there will ipso facto be confusion in the minds of the\n                                public. If that was intended, s 27(2)(b) [see [15] ofThe\n                                Polo/Lauren Co (CA)where it was held that this approach\n                            also applied to s 8(2)(b) TMA] would\n                            have been phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no\n                            presumption of confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.\n                            … [emphasis added] 38     I now proceed to consider these respective\n                    conditions against the facts of this case in accordance with this\n                    framework. Condition 1: Similarity between the “HYSTERIC\n                GLAMOUR” and “GLAMOUR” word marks 39     At the outset, it must be borne in mind that\n                    the word marks compared in this appeal were devoid of any stylisation,\n                    embellishment or device, and were as follows: Ozone’s word\n                                    markAMP’s word markHYSTERIC\n                                        GLAMOURGLAMOUR   (1)   The approach to be adopted (A)   VISUAL, AURAL AND CONCEPTUAL SIMILARITY 40     As mentioned at[12]above, there are three aspects to similarity,viz, visual similarity, aural or phonetic similarity and\n                    conceptual similarity (seeThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [10]). Whether there is a similarity of marks in these three aspects of\n                    similarity is essentially a question of fact (seeJohnson\n                        & Johnson v Uni-Charm Kabushiki Kaisha (Uni-Charm Corp)[2007] 1 SLR 1082 (“Johnson &\n                        Johnson”) at [9]). The law doesnothowever requireallthree\n                    similarities to be made out before the finding that the two marks are similar\n                    can be made (seeMediaCorpat [32]). In this\n                    aspect, the observations of Bently and Sherman inIntellectual Property Law(Oxford University Press, 3rd Ed,\n                    2009) (“Bently & Sherman”) at\n                    pp 863-866 are also apposite (footnotes omitted): Visual, aural and conceptual similarity. The\n                        marks should be assessed from the point of view of their visual, aural and\n                        conceptual similarities. Typically, tribunals consider\n                            each in turn, before reaching an overall conclusion. In so doing, they\n                            have observed that a trade-off can occur: visual and conceptual\n                            differences, for example, can offset aural\n                        similarities. … The relative importance of each sort of similarity will vary with the\n                        circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark.\n                        … Each case is therefore to be viewed in its own context. However,\n                        the ECJ has ruled [inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen\n                            Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999] 2CMLR1343] that,in an appropriate\n                            case, mere aural similarity may make marks so similar as to be likely to\n                            cause confusion… … In other situations, conceptual dissimilarity, as for\n                            example where one mark has a meaning but its comparator does not, may\n                            counteract aural or visual similarity. [emphasis added] 41     A useful case in point is that ofMystery Drinks GmbH v Office for Harmonisation in the Internal\n                        Market (Trade Marks and Designs), Karlsberg Brauerei KG Weber\n                        Intervening[2004] ETMR 217 (which was cited with approval inJohnson & Johnsonat [13]), where\n                    “Mystery” was refused registration for non-alcoholic drinks as the\n                    mark “Mixery” had already been registered for beer. The learned\n                    authors ofBently & Shermannote at footnote\n                    51, pp 864-865 that although the: … figurative mark MYSTERY with stylized M and MIXERY wereneither conceptually nor visually similar, butwere aurally similar…in the field of beverages\n                            this was sufficient. [emphasis added] 42     Accordingly, the relative importance of each\n                    type of similarity will thus vary with the circumstances in hand, in particular\n                    the goods and the types of mark. The fact that one type of similarity is made\n                    out doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. Also, regard should be had to thetypeof\n                    marks being compared (seeMediaCorpat\n                    [32]). (B)   DISTINCTIVENESS 43     The distinctiveness in the earlier trade mark\n                        (ie, “GLAMOUR” in this case) is\n                    also one important factor in the inquiry into the similarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. In this vein, Ng-Loy Wee\n                    Loon inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singapore(Sweet & Maxwell Asia, 2009) (“Law of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singapore”) observes as follows (footnotes\n                    omitted): Comparison between marks … [21.5.12]The distinctiveness in the earlier\n                        trade mark is one important factor.Where a common word\n                            is included in the earlier trade mark, the tribunal should be wary of\n                            granting a monopoly in its use. This translates into a reluctance to\n                            hold that two marks which contain a common word are similar\n                            marks. [emphasis added] 44     The learned authors ofBently & Shermannote further at pp 866-868 (footnotes\n                    omitted): Distinctiveness. The question of whether\n                        marks are similar will often be dependent on the inherent or acquired\n                        distinctiveness of the mark (for the goods or services for which it is\n                        registered). This has a number of effects First,the less distinctive the earlier trade mark, the\n                            less literal or visual alteration is necessary to ensure that the later\n                            mark is not similar. For example, the CFI comparing two words\n                        CASTELLANI and CASTERLLUCA for wine from the point of view of a German\n                        consumer found the two marks to be dissimilar, because the\n                        ‘castel’ element is a common descriptive component in wine names\n                        and the applicant’s suffix ‘luca’ would be seen as the\n                        Italian name and thus sufficient to differentiate the marks. InReed Executive plc v Reed Business Information Ltd[[2004] RPC (40) 767], Jacob LJ stated that‘where\n                            a mark is descriptive small differences may suffice to avoid\n                            confusion’, giving an illustration from the law of\n                        passing-off concerning the terms OFFICE CLEANING ASSOCIATION and OFFICE\n                        CLEANING SERVICES.Where the distinctiveness of the\n                            earlier trade mark is very low, the later mark will have to be in close\n                            proximity for it to be similar, as with THERMAWEAR and\n                        THERMAWARM.The same principle applies to common names\n                            which intrinsically have a low level of\n                        distinctiveness. Second, if the earlier mark is highly distinctive, then a mark that has\n                        been substantially modified might nonetheless still be similar.\n                        … [emphasis added] 45     That this is the approach adopted in Singapore\n                    case-law can be seen from the High Court’s decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co, LP v Shop In Department Store Pte Ltd[2005]\n                    4 SLR 816 (“The Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC)”): The similarity between the plaintiff’s marks and\n                            the defendant’s sign 26    The decided cases suggest that there are three\n                            aspects to similarity: visual, aural or phonetic, and conceptual. In\n                            terms of visual similarity, it is clear that the mark and the sign share\n                            one common denominator: the word “POLO”.In cases where there is a common denominator, it is\n                                important to look at the differences between the mark and the sign\n                                in order to decide whether the challenged sign has been able to\n                                distinguish itself sufficiently and substantially:The European Limited v The Economist Newspapers\n                                Limited[1996] FSR 431 at 436; see alsoKerly’s Law of Trade Marks and Trade Names(Sweet & Maxwell, 13th Ed, 2001) at paras 16-63 to\n                            16-67...In other words, sometimes, looking at the\n                                challenged sign as a whole, the distinctiveness of the registered\n                                word mark is dissolved by the addition of the word. Accordingly, the\n                                similarity between the mark and the sign is significantly\n                                diminishedand may be insufficient to cause a likelihood\n                            of confusion. 27In the present case, the\n                                differences are obvious: the addition of the word\n                                “PACIFIC” together with the sign’s different\n                                font and design. The question, then, is whether these differences\n                                are enough so as not to capture the distinctiveness of the\n                                registered mark. In order to decide this, I first have to consider\n                                whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to be so\n                                distinctive that the differences would not negate the\n                                similarity. This is an important issue because a more\n                            distinct mark generally receives greater protection:Premier Brands UK Ltd v Typhoon Europe Ltd[2000] FSR\n                            767 (“Premier Brands”).\n                            … 28    …[I] am prepared to accept that the plaintiff’s\n                                word mark is somewhat distinctive but not strikingly so. As such,\n                                the differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the\n                                defendant’s sign are sufficient so that the latter does not\n                                capture the distinctiveness of the registered mark and is therefore\n                                not similar to the defendant’s mark.\n                            … [emphasis added] 46     While the italicised words in [26] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(reproduced above at[45]) seem to suggest that the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into thelikelihood of confusion(as opposed tosimilarity between the marks: see[43]above), those in[27](viz, “I\n                    first have to consider whether the plaintiff’s mark can be considered to\n                    be so distinctive that the differences would not negate thesimilarity” [emphasis added]\n                        and[28](viz, “the\n                    differences between the plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s sign\n                    are sufficient so that the latter does not capture the distinctiveness of the\n                    registered mark and is therefore notsimilarto\n                    the defendant’s mark”(emphasis added)) of the decision make it clear\n                        thatthe distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween\n                    the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA. 47     In any event, the Court of Appeal’s\n                    subsequent decision inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)does indicate that the distinctiveness in an earlier trade mark is an important\n                    factor to be considered in the inquiry into thesimilaritybetween the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA and is not confined to the analysis of the\n                    likelihood of confusion: Similarity between the mark and the\n                        sign … 23    …There was simply no evidence before the court to show\n                                that the word “polo” per se is distinctive.\n                            Indeed, the word “polo” is an ordinary English word\n                            meaning a game played on horseback…We\n                                recognise that some marks are inherently distinctive because they\n                                consist of inventive words without any notional or allusive\n                                quality. An example would be “Volvo”.“Polo” is certainly not an\n                                inventive word and could claim no inherent distinctiveness. Where\n                                common words are included in a registered mark, the courts should be\n                                wary of granting a monopoly in their use: seeThe European Limited v The Economist Newspaper\n                                Limited[1998] FSR 283 at 289–290 and\n                            “FRIGIKING” Trade Mark [1973] RPC 739 at 753.Any alleged distinctiveness must be acquired through use.\n                                Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                                light of all the circumstances of the case.\n                        ... 24Bearing in mind that\n                                “polo” is a common English word, we are unable to see\n                                how it could be said that the sign “POLO PACIFIC” with\n                                its special font and design is similar to the mark\n                                “POLO” except in the broadest of sense that one word\n                                is common. In any event,for the\n                                purpose of determining similarityunder s 27(2) of\n                            the Act, one must look at the mark and the sign as a whole (seeIn the Matter of an Application by the Pianotist\n                                Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 (“Pianotist”) andCooper Engineering\n                                Company Proprietary Limited v Sigmund Pumps Limited[1952] 86 CLR 536 (“Cooper”)) and,bearing in mind\n                                the actual differences between the two, we cannot see how it can be\n                                said that the trial judge was wrong when he held that the sign and\n                                the mark are not similar. All the more so when the appellant was not\n                                even claiming a monopoly of the word “polo”.\n                                Accordingly, we agree with the judge that the two are visually,\n                                aurally and conceptually different. [emphasis added] 48     In accordance with this approach, I now\n                    proceed to examine whether Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark\n                    is “similar” to AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA. (2)   Visual similarity 49     In the case of word marks, a determination of\n                    visual similarity typically involves looking at the (seeBently & Shermanat p 865): (a)length of the marks;(b)structure of the marks (ie, whether there are the same number of words);\n                            and(c)whether the same letters are used in the\n                            marks.50     When comparing two marks visually, one must\n                    also bear in mind the “imperfect recollection” of the consumer\n                        (ie, that the consumer may not be able to\n                    remember a mark perfectly) (seeNautical Concept Pte Ltd v\n                        Jeffrey Mark Richard[2007] 1 SLR 1071 at [30]). The\n                    average consumer only rarely has the chance to make a direct comparison between\n                    the marks, and so must place his trust in the “imperfect picture of [the\n                    two marks] that he has kept in his mind” (Lloyd\n                        Schuhfabrik Meyer v Klijsen Handel BV, Case C-342/97 [1999]\n                    2 CMLR 1343, 1358-9). Accordingly, where at first glance two marks may\n                    appear to be dissimilar, when the possibility of imperfect recollection is taken\n                    into account, the two marks may in fact be similar (seeBently & Shermanat p 865). Hence, the court will not\n                    compare the two marks side by side and examine them in detail because\n                    “the person who is confused often makes comparison from memory removed in\n                    time and space from the marks” (Caterpillar Inc v Ong\n                        Eng Peng (formerly trading as Catplus International)[2006]\n                    2 SLR 669 at [55] per Tay Yong Kwang J). The court should also\n                    not take into account “any external added matter or circumstances”\n                    as the comparison is mark for mark.51     I have already set out at[13]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were visuallydissimilar. While the PAR’s statement by itself\n                    that:68    … the simple analysis in visual similarity\n                            is merely to look at the marks…isinaccurategiven that the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA must also necessarily consider, if any, the distinctive\n                    components of the marks (see[43]–[47]above), this\n                    was nevertheless done because the PAR also noted in the same paragraph\n                    that:68    … I do not think that the language\n                            represented by the letters [in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC\n                            GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark]is so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                                any dominant element…[emphasis\n                        added]52     The PAR’s approach (viz, by looking at the word marksandconsidering whether the language represented by the letters\n                    in Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were so unusual or descriptive that there should be\n                    any dominant element) was consistent with that adopted by the High Court inThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC)(see[45]above), which was affirmed on appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA).53     In the present instance, although the word\n                    marks of Ozone and AMP share one common denominator,viz, the word “GLAMOUR”, I agreed with the\n                    PAR’s observation that there were:… many visual differences between the marks. The HYSTERIC GLAMOUR\n                        mark has 15 letters, GLAMOUR has 7 letters; the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark has\n                        two words, the GLAMOUR mark has one.Furthermore, given that the word “HYSTERIC”, which\n                    appears at the beginning of Ozone’s word mark, is almost of equal length\n                    to the word “GLAMOUR”, I could not see how it would be entirely\n                    overlooked or overshadowed by the word “GLAMOUR”. That\n                    Ozone’s word mark has two words was to my mind a visual difference. Thus,\n                    even if “GLAMOUR” is the more common word of the two (ie, “HYSTERIC” and\n                    “GLAMOUR”) and may come to mind more quickly than\n                    “HYSTERIC”, the consumer with an imperfect recollection (see[50]above) would still remember that\n                    Ozone’s word mark has an additional word to “GLAMOUR”. In\n                    these circumstances, I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s finding that\n                    Ozone‘s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark was visuallydissimilarto AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark.(3)   Aural similarity54     I have already set out at[14]above the PAR’s reasons for holding\n                    that Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were aurallydissimilar. It is worth noting that inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1943) 60 RPC 87, Luxmoore LJ’s\n                    dissenting judgment stated, at 108:[t]he answer to the question whether the sound of one word resembles too\n                        nearly the sound of another …must nearly always depend on first impression,\n                        for obviously a person who is familiar with both words will neither be\n                        deceived nor confused. It is the person who only knows the one word and has\n                        perhaps animperfect recollectionof it who is\n                        likely to be deceived or confused. [emphasis added]This statement was cited with approval in the House of Lords by\n                    Viscount Maugham inAristoc, Ld v Rysta, Ld(1945)\n                    62 RPC 65 at 72.55     InBently &\n                        Shermanat p 865, the learned authors noted that:When comparing marks aurally, tribunals have tended to carry out a\n                        quantitative assessment: do the two signs have more syllables in common than\n                        not?In these circumstances, I was of the view that the PAR’s\n                    approach in dealing with the question of aural similarity was entirely\n                    consistent with the foregoing approach.56     In this case, both “HYSTERIC”\n                    and “GLAMOUR” were English words, although the latter could be\n                    said to be the more common English word. However, it must be borne in mind that\n                    Ozone’s word markstartswith the entirely\n                    separate word “HYSTERIC” preceding the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. Also, Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark would be read and pronounced as two separate and distinct words, in\n                    the order of “HYSTERIC” and “GLAMOUR”. AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark, on the other hand, would be read as a single\n                    word. The comparison in this case was between a two-word mark and a single word\n                    mark, so that even if the actual word “HYSTERIC” was forgotten, it\n                    would not be forgotten that there was an additional word in Ozone’s word\n                    mark. While I did not agree entirely with the reasons of the PAR, I also\n                    concluded that the words marks were aurallydissimilar.(4)   Conceptual similarity57     With regard to the requirement of conceptual\n                    similarity,Bently & Shermannote at\n                    p 866 (footnotes omitted):Because similarity is assessed conceptually as well as visually and\n                        phonetically, in thinking about whether marks are similar, it is necessary\n                        to take account of the ideas that lie behind or inform the earlier mark.\n                        …AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark in the present case\n                    clearly relied on the orthodox meaning of “glamour”.58     In this instance, the PAR had held that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilar. Ozone contended that the PAR, who had found the word\n                    marks both visually and aurallydissimilar, had\n                    then subsequently erred in his finding that the word marks were similar on the\n                    basis of conceptual similarityalone. To this end,\n                    it referred to the following passage in the decision of the High Court inMcDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises Pte\n                        Ltd[2004] 2 SLR 652 (McDonald’s (HC)) (an appeal against which was dismissed by\n                    the Court of Appeal inMcDonald’s\n                    (CA):43    As to the visual and\n                            aural similarities of the marks, I do not consider them to be\n                            confusingly similar. There are indeed significant visual differences\n                            between them – the depiction of an eagle as opposed to the golden\n                            arches forming the letter “M” – and aural\n                            differences – “McChicken”,\n                            “McNuggets”, “Egg McMuffin” and\n                            “Sausage McMuffin” compared to “MacTea”,\n                            “MacChocolate” and “MacNoodles”. Below the\n                            word component “MacTea”, for example, the legend\n                            “3-in-1 Instant Hot Tea” appears. Other than the letter\n                            “M” in “MacTea”, there is no mark similar to\n                            the opponents’ “M” logo anywhere on the packaging.\n                            The word marks are also different in appearance in terms of colour, font\n                            and typeface. The second and third syllables of the application marks\n                            are different in sound from the opponents’. The differences leave\n                            different impressions on people’s\n                            minds.44    Is there a conceptual\n                            link between the two in that the common use of the first syllable\n                            “Mac” or “Mc” means that both are likely to\n                            be taken as indicative of a common identity? The use of the first\n                            syllable “Mac” in the applicants’ range of products\n                            is not unlike the case of the opponents in that TWC has admitted to the\n                            use of the same naming system as McDonald’s. But it does not, in\n                            my view, override the other differences mentioned earlier and, when\n                            viewed as a whole,I do not believe there will be\n                                confusion between the rival marks. Having found the dissimilarity in\n                                the marks, visually and aurally, the common idea conveyed by\n                                competing marks is not overriding or determinative.

[emphasis added]also merits closer scrutiny. This observation was made by the Federal\n                    Court inSports Caféafter reviewing an extract\n                    from the earlier decision ofCooper Engineering Co Pty Ltd v\n                        Sigmund Pumps Ltd(1952) 86 CLR 536 (“Cooper Engineering”). InSports Café, the Federal Court stated at 556-557 that:The idea behind the markInCooper Engineeringthe application was\n                        for registration of the words “Rain King”. The\n                        opponent’s mark was RAINMASTER.…After pointing out the differences between the suffix\n                        “master” and the word “King” in appearance and\n                        sound [Dixon, William and Kitto JJ] continued (at 538-9):The two words are so unlike to the eye and to the ear that counsel for\n                            the appellant was forced to rely on the likelihood of deception arising\n                            from the two words conveying the same idea of the superiority or\n                            supremacy of the article as a mechanism for making a spray similar to\n                            falling rain or artificial rain as it was called during the argument.\n                            But it is obvious that trade marks, especially word marks, could be\n                            quite unlike and yet convey the same idea of the superiority or some\n                            particular suitability of an article for the work it was intended to do.\n                            To refuse an application for registration on this ground would be to\n                            give the proprietor of a registered trade mark a complete monopoly of\n                            all words conveying the same idea as his trade mark. The fact that two\n                            marks convey the same idea is not sufficient in itself to create a\n                            deceptive resemblance between them, although this fact could be taken\n                            into account in deciding whether two marks which really looked alike or\n                            sounded alike were likely to deceive.Thus the fact that two marks convey a common idea becomes relevant only if\n                        the marks themselves look or sound alike. Commonality of idea might then tip\n                        the balance in favour of a finding that the likeness is deceptive.61     I could not agree with the narrow approach inCooper Engineering. While I agreed that one\n                    should be slow to refuse registration of a mark simply on the basis of\n                    conceptual similarity alone, I was also of the view that it would be wrong to\n                    say that conceptual similarity would be relevant only if there was visual or\n                    aural similarity. As mentioned (at[42]above), the relative importance of each type of similarity must necessarily vary\n                    with the circumstances in hand, in particular the goods and the types of mark\n                    being compared. The fact that one type of similarity is made out also doesnotnecessarily mean that the marks are\n                    similar. To adopt an overly generalised and restrictive principle that\n                    conceptual similarity isonlyrelevant to\n                    determining similarity between marks when either visual or aural similarity has\n                    been made out would be to ignore the fact that each aspect of similarity can\n                    vary in different degreesvis-à-viseach other\n                    depending on the circumstances, and trade-offs are entirely possible between the\n                    three aspects of similarity – for example, conceptual similarity can\n                    offset visual and aural dissimilarities. A similar approach was also adopted inLloyd Schuhfabrik Meyer & Co GmbH v Klijsen\n                        Handel BV[2000] FSR 77 (a decision which was followed by\n                    the High Court inRichemont International SA v Goldlion\n                        Enterprise (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR 401) at\n                    84:28.    In order to assess the degree of similarity\n                            between the marks concerned, the nationalcourt must\n                                determine the degree of visual, aural or conceptual similarity\n                                between them and, where appropriate, evaluate the importance to be\n                                attached to those different elements, taking account of\n                            the category of goods or services in question and the circumstances in\n                            which they are marketed. [emphasis added]In these circumstances, I was of the view that, in this instance,\n                    despite the word marks being visually and aurally dissimilar, conceptual\n                    similarityneverthelessdeserved\n                    consideration.62     The PAR’s reasons for holding that\n                    Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark were conceptuallysimilarhave already been set out above at[15]. Against this, Ozone contended however that\n                    the two marks were conceptuallydissimilar. It\n                    pointed out that while the word “GLAMOUR” was defined in the\n                    onlineMerriam-Websterdictionary as “an\n                    exciting and often illusory and romantic attractiveness”, the usage of\n                    the word “HYSTERIC”, which was defined in theLongman Dictionary of the English Languageas “someone\n                    suffering from hysteria”, changed the complexion of the word\n                    “GLAMOUR”. According to it, although the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” was still present in “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”,\n                    the concept had varied because one does not associate “HYSTERIC”\n                    with “GLAMOUR”. To support its position, it cited the case ofItochu Corporation v Worldwide Brands, Inc[2007] SGIPOS 9 (“Itochu”), where\n                    the marks under comparison were “CAMEL” and\n                    “SWEETCAMEL”, as being “closely analogous” to the\n                    present factual matrix. In holding that these marks were conceptuallydissimilar, the PAR in that case made the following\n                    observations at [37]:37    Bearing in mind the Opponents’ argument that\n                            the average consumer normally perceives the mark as a whole without\n                            analysing its various details - a principle which has also been relied\n                            on by the Applicants - and that marks should not be compared side by\n                            side as marks are generally remembered by general impressions rather\n                            than by recollection of the whole;I find that there\n                                is no conceptual similarity between the Opponents’ and the\n                                Applicants’ marks. The Applicants’\n                                “SWEETCAMEL” mark does not convey the same idea and\n                                impression as the Opponents’ marks. The Opponents’\n                                “CAMEL” marks evoke the sense of ruggedness, adventure\n                                and masculinity whereas the Applicants’ mark which is preceded\n                                by the adjective “sweet” projects a totally opposite\n                                impression. [emphasis added]The decision inItochuwas upheld on\n                    appeal by the High Court.63     In the present instance, while the PAR was of\n                    the view that the word “HYSTERIC” did modify the concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” to a “certain point”, the main concept of\n                    “GLAMOUR” hadnotbeen\n                    “completely reversed” as inItochu.\n                    In this aspect, the PAR observed:70    … In this case, the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark\n                            still relies on the concept that they are ‘glamorous’,\n                            albeit injecting the new element of being ‘hysterically\n                            glamorous’. From another point of view this should still hold\n                            true; the concept of [Ozone] cannot be that the clothes do not look\n                            glamorous at all, otherwise it would frustrate the purpose of their\n                            mark, which is to sell designed clothes at a premium\n                        price.71    I am of the view that the HYSTERIC GLAMOUR mark is\n                            in some way conceptually similar to the GLAMOUR mark in that both use\n                            the ‘glamour’ concept, one mark appeals to orthodox meaning\n                            of ‘glamour’ while the other mark gives a spin to it but\n                            still is based on ‘glamour’. ...64     I saw no reason to disturb the PAR’s\n                    holding that the word marks in this case were “in some way” (as\n                    opposed to completely or to a large extent) conceptually similar. As Ozone\n                    conceded, the concept of “GLAMOUR” was still present in\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR”.65     The inquiry however does not stop here. The\n                    distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark must also be\n                    considered at this stage.(5)   Distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word\n                mark66     In the present case, the PAR did not find\n                    it:72    … necessary to follow the principles\n                            [enunciated inThe European Ltd v The Economist\n                                Newspaper Ltd[1998] ETMR 307] of descriptive elements\n                            allowing closer similarity…because he was of the opinion that:… that principle in particular should only act as a[n] advanced\n                        argument in case the basic analyses do not reveal any clear result.67     This approach is howevercontraryto that set out above at[43]–[47]where the\n                    distinctiveness of the earlier trade mark is an important factor in the inquiry\n                    into the similarity between the marks under s 8(2)(b) TMA.68     In these circumstances, I was of the view that\n                    the PAR had erred in failing to gofurtherafter\n                    considering the visual, aural and conceptual similarity of the word marks to\n                    consider the level of distinctiveness of AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    word mark in his inquiry into the similarity between the marks under\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA.69     In the present instance, there was no evidence\n                    before me to show that the word “GLAMOUR”, which is an ordinary\n                    English word (see[62]above) and not an\n                    inventive word, is inherently distinctive. The word “GLAMOUR”, the\n                    title of AMP’s magazine, in factdescribesthe very nature of the content in AMP’s magazine, which is described, on\n                    its website, as a magazine for young women interested in fashion, beauty and a\n                    contemporary lifestyle and which contains a number of photographs and\n                    advertisements displaying fashionable clothing and accessories. In my view, the\n                    word “GLAMOUR” isnotinherently\n                    distinctive.70     Has the word mark “GLAMOUR” then\n                    acquired distinctiveness through use in Singapore? To my mind, based on the\n                    limited and unsatisfactory evidence tendered by AMP which did little to support\n                    its claim that the “GLAMOUR” mark was extensively used in\n                    Singapore, this question must be answered in the negative. As evidence in\n                    support of its circulation figures between 1990 - 2002 (see [14] of the GD), AMP\n                    tenderednineinvoices from STP Distributors Pte\n                    Ltd dated:(a)10 March 2000 to “TIMES THE BOOKSHOP\n                            PTE LTD” at Centrepoint Shopping Centre (“TIMES”)\n                            showing a sale of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(b)14 July 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of 40\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(c)8 September 2000 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            40 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(d)24 August 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(e)7 September 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            50 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(f)26 October 2001 to TIMES showing a sale of\n                            30 “GLAMOUR” magazines;(g)18 January 2002 to a “COLD\n                            STORAGE” supermarket outlet showing a sale of 30\n                            “GLAMOUR” magazines;(h)12 April 2002 to TIMES showing a sale\n                            of 30 “GLAMOUR” magazines; and(i)13 September 2002 to TIMES showing a\n                            sale of 20 “GLAMOUR” magazines.71     It may readily be observed that these nine\n                    invoices related only to sales inspecificmonths\n                    in thelimitedperiod from 2000 to 2002. They did\n                    not reflect a monthly distribution from 1984 (the year AMP claimed its use of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” mark in Singapore started) and neither did they\n                    correspond to the total distribution figures submitted by AMP (see [14] of the\n                    GD). For example, although the invoice dated 24 August 2001 reflected only\n                    the sale of 30 copies of the September 2001 edition of the\n                    “GLAMOUR” magazine to TIMES, AMP claimed a distribution figure of\n                    823 in September 2001. The nine invoices adduced supported only a fraction of\n                    the distribution figures claimed by AMP. Furthermore, the nine invoices related\n                    only to the distribution of the “GLAMOUR” magazine toonebranch of TIMES (viz,\n                    the Centrepoint outlet) andasingle supermarket.\n                    There was nothing in evidence to support the promotion and/or subsequent sale of\n                    the “GLAMOUR” magazine to the Singapore public. In these\n                    circumstances, given the paucity of AMP’s evidence, I was of the view that\n                    it could not be said that the “GLAMOUR” mark had acquired\n                    distinctiveness through use in Singapore.72     AMP sought to argue, without raising any\n                    relevant authority, that its “GLAMOUR” word mark was distinctive\n                    by virtue of the fact that it was a registered trade mark under the Act. However\n                    such a line of argument was rejected by the Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA):23 …Thus, the question of distinctiveness must be determined in the\n                        light of all the circumstances of the case. No authority has been cited to\n                        substantiate the assertion that the fact of registration is conclusive as to\n                        the distinctiveness of a mark. Neither does it follow that the incorporation\n                        of an entire registered word mark would automatically lead to infringement.\n                        …(6)   Conclusion on the overall similarity between the\n                marks73     Given my conclusion that Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and AMP’s\n                    “GLAMOUR” word mark was visually and aurallydissimilar, but conceptuallysimilar, and that “GLAMOUR” was merely descriptive\n                    and neither inherently distinctive nor distinctive by use, I was of the view\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between the marks\n                    under s 8(2)(b) TMA. Strictly speaking,\n                    having arrived at this conclusion, it was not necessary, for the purposes of\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA to go on to consider\n                    Condition 2 (see [36(b)] above) and Condition 3 (see [36(c)] above).\n                    Nevertheless, for the sake of completeness, I shall do so.Condition 2: Similarity of goods74     With regard to this requirement, the learned\n                    authors ofBently & Shermannote at\n                    p 869:2.3.2 When are goods or services\n                        similar?The question of whether goods or services are similar depends on the facts\n                        of the case. When deciding whether a trade mark application falls foul of\n                        one of the relative grounds for refusal, the comparison is normally between\n                        the goods or services for which the earlier mark has been registered and the\n                        goods or services to which the application relates. …75     The relevant factors for assessing similarity\n                    of goods covered by Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark and\n                    AMP’s “GLAMOUR” word mark are (seeBritish Sugar Plc v James Robertson & Sons Ltd[1996] RPC\n                    281 (“British Sugar”) at\n                    296–297):(a)     the respective uses of the\n                        respective goods;(b)     the respective end users of the respective goods:(c)     the physical nature of the\n                        goods;(d)     the\n                        respective trade channels through which the goods reach the\n                    market;(e)     in the case\n                        of self-serve consumer items, whether in practice they are respectively\n                        found or likely to be found on the same or different shelves;\n                    and(f)     whether the\n                        respective goods are competitive or complementary. This inquiry may take\n                        into account how those in trade classify goods, for instance whether market\n                        research companies who act for industry put the goods or services in the\n                        same or different sectors.These factors were adopted inJohnson & Johnsonat [14] andMediaCorpat [41]. These factors need not all be\n                    satisfied before the goods can be treated as similar (Johnson\n                        & Johnsonat [18]).76     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanexplain at pp 869-870 (footnotes\n                    omitted) how these factors were applied inBritish Sugar\n                        vis-à-visa non-distinctive mark (as I had adjudged\n                    “GLAMOUR” to be (see[66]–[72]above)\n                    :[British Sugar] illustrates how the courts\n                        have applied the factors in the case of a non-distinctive mark (namely\n                        TREAT). There the question was whether a sweet syrup to be poured over\n                        desserts was similar to a sweet-flavoured spread. Jacob J concluded\n                        that the goods were not similar, explaining that the goods were used\n                        differently (the spread could be used on desserts but generally would not\n                        be); were not in direct competition; were located in different places in\n                        supermarkets (the spread with jams, the dessert sauce with desserts); were\n                        physically different (the spread was more viscous than the sauce); and were\n                        treated differently by market researches. In contrast inBalmoral Trade Mark[[1999] RPC 297,302], whisky and wine\n                        were held to be similar goods: although the two products have very different\n                        producers, it is common to find them being bought and sold by the same\n                        merchants, and sold through the same outlets.77     As noted above at[17], the PAR however saw no reason to decide along the lines of\n                    theBritish Sugarfactors (see[75]above) in coming to his conclusion\n                    that:… the scope of [AMP’s] description of goods (“Magazines, books and publications”)\n                        is clearly a sub-set of the goods of [Ozone] (in particular the mention of“printed matter”in the\n                        description of [Ozone’s] goods).[emphasis in original]78     The PAR had also referred to an apparent\n                    concession by Ozone that “there may be an overlap [between AMP’s\n                    goods and] the goods that [Ozone is] applying for”. For convenience, it\n                    would be useful to set out the nature of the parties’ respective\n                    goods:Ozone’s goods in\n                                        Class 16AMP’s goods in\n                                        Class 16Paper and cardboard;\n                                            industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                                            paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper;\n                                            handkerchiefs of paper; paper patterns; tailors’\n                                            chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper; banners\n                                            of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags;printed matter; paintings and\n                                            calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands;\n                                            playing cards; stationery and study\n                                        materialsMagazines,\n                                                books and\n                                    publicationsIn the course of the hearing before me, Ozone pointed out that its\n                    concession of an overlap with AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” wasonlylimited to\n                    “printed matter” and didnotextend\n                    to “paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels\n                    of paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                    paper patterns; tailors’ chalk; table cloths of paper; blinds of paper;\n                    banners of paper; flags of paper; baggage tags…paintings and calligraphic\n                    works; photographs, photographs stands; playing cards; stationery and study\n                    materials” (“Ozone’s other goods”), which according\n                    to Ozone were “very different” from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone submitted that Ozone’s other goods could\n                    “be broadly classified into stationery, hygiene paper products\n                    labels/banners/blinds made of paper and photographs” and that applying\n                    theBritish Sugartest, Ozone’s other goods\n                    were different in function from “magazines, books and\n                    publications”. Ozone contended that the parties’ respective target\n                    consumers were also different as people buying magazines would not be purchasing\n                    “stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper\n                    and photographs” as alternatives and accordingly the compared goods were\n                    not in competition. The trade channels were also different. While AMP’s\n                    “magazines, books and publications” were likely to be sold at\n                    newsstands and bookstores, Ozone’s other goods would be sold at\n                    supermarkets, furniture stores or bookstores and that even if Ozone’s\n                    other goods were sold in the same stores, they would be placed at different\n                    sections of the store as “magazines are not usually placed together with\n                    stationery, hygiene paper products labels/banners/blinds made of paper and\n                    photographs”.79     Ozone referred to the decision ofIn the Matter of Application No 2242582A by the Secretary to the\n                        Quorn Hunt to register a series of trade marks in Classes 9, 13, 16, 18, 21,\n                        25 and 41 and In the Matter of Opposition No 90056 by Marlow Foods\n                        Limited(O-319-04)[note: 1](“Marlow Foods”) where the\n                    respective goods in Class 16 being compared were as follows (see para\n                    28):Applicant’s Goods in\n                                            Class 16Opponent’s Goods in\n                                            Class 16Printed\n                                                matter, stationery, writing and drawing\n                                            instruments,cards,\n                                            postcards photographs, pictures,calendars, coasters, posters,diaries, instruction manuals;\n                                            but not including any such goods relating to food\n                                            preparationPrinted matter, books and\n                                            periodicals concerning the use of myco-protein in food\n                                            preparation.[emphasis added]The compared marks were similar (ie,\n                    Condition 1 was satisfied). The hearing officer found that the goods\n                    “printed matter, “cards”, “calendars” and\n                    “diaries” were similar to the Opponent’s goods but allowed\n                    the Applicant’s mark to proceed to registration in respect of the\n                    remaining goods,viz, “…stationery,\n                    writing and drawing instruments, cards, postcards photographs, pictures,\n                    …coasters, posters [and] instruction manuals” which were\n                    considered dissimilar.80     I found Ozone’s arguments and the\n                    approach inMarlow Foodspractical and sensible.\n                    In these circumstances, I was of the view that although “printed\n                    matter” in Ozone’s goods weresimilarto AMP’s goods (viz, “magazines,\n                    books and publications”), Ozone’s other goods weredissimilar. Accordingly, I was of the view that the PAR\n                    had erred in finding that Ozone’s other goods were similar to AMP’s\n                    goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                    publications”). Accordingly, I was of the view that Condition 2 was\n                    thus satisfiedonlyto the extent as described. I\n                    now move on to examine Condition 3.Condition 3: Likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                public81     As stated above at[37],evenwhere the marks are\n                    similarandthe goods are similar, this does not\n                    mean that there willipso factobe confusion in\n                    the mind of the public. There isnopresumption of\n                    confusion even where these two aspects of similarity are made out (The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)at [8]).82     The learned authors ofBently & Shermanelaborate at p 872 (footnotes omitted)\n                    as to what the public must be confused about:2.3.3 Likelihood of confusion…What must the public be confused about? The next question to consider is\n                        what is meant by ‘likelihood of confusion’ in [s 8(2)(b) TMA]?\n                        In its ‘classic form’,consumers must be\n                            confused about the source or origin of the goods or services –\n                            that is, they must be confused as to the designer, manufacturer,\n                            selector or supplier of the goods or services. In other words, classic\n                            confusion is concerned with the situation where consumers believe that\n                            the goods or services emanate from one organization, but they, in fact\n                            come from a different independent organization. This classic\n                        form of confusion has been extended to accommodate broader understandings of\n                        the source of goods or services. Consequently, aperson\n                            will be confused for the purposes of [s 8(2)(b) TMA] if they incorrectly\n                            assume that there is some broader kind of economic connection between\n                            the users of marks, for example, that the goods are being provided by a\n                            subsidiary or licensee of the trade mark owner.\n                        …In considering whether there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion, the tribunals must consider whether there is a genuine and\n                            properly substantiated likelihood of confusion: it is not enough that\n                            confusion is hypothetical and remote. The term ‘likelihood’\n                            indicates probability rather than possibility.[emphasis added]83     As to what constitutes “likelihood of\n                    confusion”, these principles, as distilled from previous cases, were\n                    succinctly laid out inMediaCorp(which had\n                    similarly dealt with s 8(2)(b) TMA) at\n                    [43]:43    The following\n                            principles as to what constitutes “likelihood of\n                            confusion” can be distilled from the cases:(a)    The court is\n                                entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as the\n                                articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion\n                                    ([The Polo/Lauren Co (CA)] at\n                                [8]).(b)    The question of\n                                likelihood of confusion has to be looked at globally taking into\n                                account all the circumstances including ([The\n                                    Polo/Lauren Co (CA)] at [28]):(i)    the closeness of the goods;(ii)   the impression given by the\n                                marks;(iii)   the possibility of imperfect\n                                    recollection;(iv)   the risk that the public might believe\n                                    that the goods come from the same source or economically-linked\n                                    sources;(v)    the steps taken by the defendant to\n                                    differentiate the goods from those of the registered proprietor;\n                                    and(vi)   the kind of customer who would be likely\n                                    to buy the goods of the applicant and opponent.(c)    One should not\n                                determine the likelihood of confusion based on the man in a hurry,\n                                and the test should be the “ordinary, sensible members of the\n                                public” ([The Polo/Lauren Co\n                                    (CA)] at [31]).

This proposition was in fact extracted fromThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)(which was a trade\n                    markinfringementaction under\n                        s 27(2)(b) TMA), which had, in turn,\n                    relied onKellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn\n                        Bhd[1999] 2 SLR 651 andMcDonald’s (CA), both of which were trade markregistrationoppositions pursuant to s 15 of the\n                    Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). The Court of Appeal inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)stated that:The approach to section 27(2) of the\n                            Act5    Section 27(2) of\n                            the Act reads:A person infringes a registered trade mark if, without\n                            the consent of the proprietor of the trade mark, he uses in the course\n                            of trade a sign where because —(a)    the sign is\n                                    identical with the trade mark and is used in relation to goods\n                                    or services similar to those for which the trade mark is\n                                    registered; or(b)    the sign is\n                                    similar to the trade mark and is used in relation to goods or\n                                    services identical with or similar to those for which the trade\n                                    mark is registered,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                            public.…8    In our opinion, having examined the express wording\n                            of s 27(2)(b), the step-by-step\n                            approach adopted inBritish Sugaris\n                            conceptually more appropriate and is in line with the structure of the\n                            provision. It seems to us that there will be infringement under that\n                            provision only if three conditions are present. First, the alleged\n                            offending sign must be shown to be similar to the registered mark.\n                            Second, both the sign and the mark must be used in relation to similar\n                            goods or services. Third, on account of the presence of the first two\n                            conditions, there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the\n                            public. As the judge rightly pointed out, s 27(2)(b) does not make it an infringement if the\n                            likelihood of confusion is caused by some other factor. While we can see\n                            some link and overlap between the first and the third conditions, it is\n                            clear that they are different. The fact that a sign is similar to a\n                            registered mark does not automatically mean that there will be a\n                            likelihood of confusion on the part of the public. That is a question of\n                            fact to be determined by the court, taking into account all the relevant\n                            circumstances. Moreover, the question of similarity is really a matter\n                            of degree. In a broad sort of sense, the greater the similarity between\n                            a mark and a sign, the greater will be the likelihood of confusion.\n                            However, if either of the first two conditions is not satisfied there\n                            will not be any need to go into the third question of determining\n                            whether there exists a likelihood of confusion. Neither does it mean\n                            that if the mark and the sign are similar, and they are used on similar\n                            goods, that there willipso factobe\n                            confusion in the minds of the public. If that was intended,\n                                s 27(2)(b) would have been\n                            phrased differently. As presently worded, there is no presumption of\n                            confusion once the two aspects of similarity are present.To determine the existence of confusion, the court is\n                                entitled to look outside the mark and the sign, as well as the\n                                articles, to assess whether there exists a likelihood of confusion:\n                                see Kellogg Co v Pacific Food Products Sdn Bhd [1999]\n                                2 SLR 651 and McDonald’s Corp v Future Enterprises\n                                Pte Ltd [2005] 1 SLR 177. While these two latter cases\n                                related to opposition proceedings under s 15 of the then Trade\n                                Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed), there is no reason why\n                                the concept of “likely to cause confusion” under that\n                                provision should be any different from the concept of\n                                “likelihood of confusion” under the present\n                                s 27(2)(b). As we see it, the global assessment test\n                            is likely to confound the final issue of confusion with the first two\n                            prerequisite conditions. Accordingly, we endorse theBritish Sugarapproach which was adopted by\n                            Lai J.[emphasis added]85     Ozone also referred to the decision of\n                    Kitchin J in the English High Court decision ofJulius\n                        Sämaan Ltd v Tetrosyl Ltd[2006] FSR 42 (“Julius Säamaan”), which involved,inter alia, a trade mark infringement action. The\n                    relevant portion of the decision, at 872, reads:52    There is one further general principle which is\n                            important to have in mind at the outset in considering infringement. The\n                            court must consider the likelihood of confusion arising from the use by\n                            the defendant of the offending sign, discounting added matter or\n                            circumstances.If the sign and the mark are\n                                confusingly similar then the defendant cannot escape by showing that\n                                by something outside the actual mark itself he has distinguished his\n                                goods from those of the proprietor. In the present case\n                            this is important.Looking at the box in which the\n                                Christmas Tree product is sold, the use of the words “Lumber\n                                Jack Flashing air freshener” must be ignored, as must the\n                                particular circumstance in which the product is sold. The comparison\n                                to be made is between, on the one hand, the Tree marks and, on the\n                                other, the Christmas Tree product itself, and the picture of it\n                                which appears on the box. [emphasis added]86     As may be seen, the approach advocated inJulius Säamaanto determining the likelihood\n                    of confusion, which doesnotlook outside the\n                    marks, isdifferentfrom that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)which “look[s] outside\n                    the mark and the sign, as well as the articles, to assess whether there exists a\n                    likelihood of confusion”. This difference was in fact noted at [18]-[20]\n                    ofThe Polo/Lauren Co (HC), with reasons offered\n                    as to why the latter approach (ie, that adopted inThe Polo/Lauren Co (CA)) should be\n                    favoured:18    However, while the\n                            global assessment test should be rejected, I am equally uncomfortable\n                            with a strict adherence to old English jurisprudence. In particular,\n                            both parties appeared to agree thatthe test for the\n                                likelihood of confusion under this approach is an exceedingly narrow\n                                one. Once a mark is shown to offend, the user “cannot escape\n                                by showing that by something outside the actual mark itself he has\n                                distinguished his goods from those of the registered\n                                proprietor”: [Saville Perfumery\n                                Ld v June Perfect Ld and F W Woolworth & Co Ld(1941)\n                            58 RPC 147] ([11]supra) at 161.\n                            If this is a correct interpretation of the case, I would decline to\n                            follow this lead for the following\n                            reasons.19    Firstly, it is\n                            worthwhile to note that even the English cases appear to differ on\n                            whether this is the correct approach. InJune\n                                Perfectitself, Sir Wilfrid Greene MR, at\n                            161–162, went on to remark that the degree of similarity required\n                            for a likelihood of confusion to be caused depended on, for example, the\n                            goods in question. Where the customers of the goods in question were not\n                            the sort who would be too careful about the details of the mark and\n                            would only remember some distinguishing feature, it would require very\n                            little for the likelihood of confusion to be caused. If, on the other\n                            hand, this is not the case, then it would require “nothing short\n                            of a degree of resemblance apparent to the eye” for there to\n                            exist a likelihood of confusion. Thus, the court is allowed to look\n                            outside the marks in order to assess how similar the marks must be for\n                            there to exist a likelihood of confusion.Origins\n                                Natural Resources Inc v Origin Clothing Limited[1995]\n                            FSR 280 (“Origins”) is of no\n                            use because the remark there that external added matter or circumstances\n                            should be discounted was made in relation to the defendant’s claim\n                            that since it and the plaintiff were trading in different markets and in\n                            different countries, the likelihood of confusion could never arise.\n                            Jacob J, in that case, rightly held that the courts must assume\n                            that the mark would be used in a normal and fair manner.

It is also important to note\n                            that in both these cases, there was no discussion of an earlier case,In the matter of an Application by the Pianotist\n                                Company Ld for the Registration of a Trade Mark(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 (“thePianotistcase”), which was affirmed inSime Darby\n                                Edible Products Ltd v Ngo Chew Hong Edible Oil Pte Ltd[2000] 4 SLR 360 (“Sime\n                                Darby”). In thePianotistcase, Parker J, at 777, having reviewed\n                            the decisions that came before, summarised the position of the law as\n                            such:You must take the two words. You must judge of them, both by their\n                            look and by their sound. You must consider the goods to which they are\n                            to be applied. You must consider the nature and kind of customer who\n                            would be likely to buy those goods. … If,considering all those circumstances, you come to the\n                            conclusion that there will be a confusion … then you must refuse\n                            the registration in that case. [emphasis added]InWagamama([11]supra), the court also did not consider thePianotistcase. Nonetheless, Laddie J\n                        was equivocal about whether the court was to find a likelihood of confusion\n                        notwithstanding that the alleged infringer had taken steps to differentiate\n                        his products from the plaintiff’s. For instance, he remarked, at\n                        720–721, that:If … the marks were too similar,usuallyinfringement would be found even if in the\n                            market place the infringer took steps to prevent confusion in fact\n                            occurring ... To this extent therefore,a registered\n                                trade mark created a monopoly which might sometimes go beyond what\n                                was strictly necessary to protect the proprietor’s goods and\n                                his reputation. [emphasis added]I am in agreement with this observation.The protection\n                            that the law offers to a registered proprietor of a trade mark is wide\n                            but it is not infinite. The ambit of that protection should be guided by\n                            the underlying aim of a trade marks regime, which is to ensure that\n                            consumers do not confuse the trade source of one product with another.\n                            For instance, where the consideration of other matters can assist the\n                            court in drawing the line at cases where the likelihood of confusion is\n                            merely imaginary, there is no reason not to do so. Otherwise, the law\n                            will end up extending protection where none is needed.20    Secondly, the\n                            Singapore cases deciding on the question of the likelihood of confusion,\n                            although mostly involving an opposition to the registration of a sign,\n                            have been much clearer and more consistent in allowing the consideration\n                            of these extraneous factors. InSime\n                            Darby, Lim Teong Qwee JC quoted and applied\n                            Parker J’s summation of the law on the issue of confusion\n                            which I quoted at [19] above. InKellogg Co v Pacific\n                                Food Products Sdn Bhd[1999] 2 SLR 651\n                                (“Kellogg”), the Court\n                            of Appeal considered an opposition to the registration of a mark under\n                            s 15 of the Trade Marks Act (Cap 332, 1992 Rev Ed). It\n                            was held, at [30] and [33],that the likelihood of confusion was to be\n                            determined on the basis of several factors, including the actual use of\n                            the mark, the reputation of the earlier mark and the packaging of the\n                            goods. More recently, in [McDonald’s\n                                (CA)] ([14]supra), the\n                            Court of Appeal held, at [66], that:[T]he question whether a proposed mark will likely give rise to\n                            confusion on account of some similarity with an existing mark is a\n                            question of fact depending on all the circumstances of the case. Besides\n                            comparing the marks, also germane are the extent of the reputation of\n                            the existing mark, how the proposed mark is to be used, the nature of\n                            the goods to which the mark will be put, how the goods are to be sold\n                            and who the target customers are: seeIn the Matter\n                                of an Application by the Pianotist Company Ltd(1906)\n                            23 RPC 774 at 777. Obviously, these considerations are not\n                            exhaustive.I am not convinced by the plaintiff’s submission that these cases\n                        should be distinguished simply because they dealt with unregistered marks.\n                        Under the relevant statute being considered by the courts in those cases was\n                        a requirement of the mark being “likely to deceive or cause\n                        confusion”. Surely it cannot be argued that this is any different\n                        than the requirement of a “likelihood of confusion” under\n                            s 27(2)(b) of the current TMA.21    Finally,turning to the plain\n                                words of s 27(2)(b) of the TMA, I find that a proper\n                                construction of the provision does not reject the court’s\n                                discretion in assessing so-called extraneous factors when deciding\n                                whether there is a likelihood of confusion. The only thing that the\n                                statute calls for is that the likelihood of confusion arises from\n                                the similarity. But where the user of a potentially infringing sign\n                                has taken pains to distinguish his products from the registered\n                                proprietor’s good[sic]and services, the effect may be\n                                that the likelihood of confusion, if any, is merely hypothetical or\n                                speculative. This is significant because unlike\n                            s 27(1) TMA, s 27(2)(b) does not\n                            presume that there is a likelihood of confusion. If there is no\n                            likelihood of confusion, there can be no infringement:Pan-West (Pte) Ltd v Grand Bigwin Pte Ltd[2003]\n                            4 SLR 755 at [12]. Section 27(2)(b) TMAalso does not forbid the court\n                                taking into account various factors in deciding the degree of\n                                similarity required in order to find that there exists a likelihood\n                                of confusion.22    Having reviewed the cases, and confining myself\n                            strictly to what is required to decide the present case, I am of the\n                            opinion thatthere are two ways in which factors\n                                extraneous to the mark come into play. One is to establish the\n                                strength of the similarity required in order to decide the question\n                                of whether there exists a likelihood of confusion.\n                            …The court cannot know what degree of similarity causes\n                            confusion unless it is able to assess, for instance, the trading\n                            circumstances of the goods in question and therefore the standard of\n                            care that the ordinary consumer will exercise in that particular case.\n                            The other is this. Where the court finds that there is a likelihood of\n                            confusion by reason of the similarity, the court must go on and enquire\n                            whether this likelihood is a real one or whether it is merely\n                            speculative or hypothetical. Where the infringer has taken sufficient\n                            steps to distinguish his goods from the plaintiff’s such that the\n                            likelihood of confusion becomes a mere possibility, there is no\n                            infringement. Of course, there is no need for plaintiffs to\n                        demonstrate that there is actual confusion. However, the courts are not to\n                        hold that there is a likelihood of confusion on the basis of “highly\n                        speculative eventuality”:McDonald’s, at [59]…[emphasis added]87     AlthoughThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (CA)was a trade markinfringementaction under s 27(2)(b) TMA, the Court of\n                    Appeal in that case was of the view that s 8(2)(b) of the TMA should besimilarlyconstrued:15    It is of interest to\n                            comparePolo Textilewith10 Royal Berkshire Polo Club Trade Mark[2001] RPC 32 (“Royal\n                                Berkshire”) where an application to register the\n                            mark “10 Royal Berkshire POLO CLUB” was opposed by\n                            the same party as the appellant in the present case. The relevant\n                            English statutory provision read:A trade mark shall not be registered if because —…(b)    it is similar to an earlier trade mark and\n                                    is to be registered for goods or services identical with or\n                                    similar to those for which the earlier trade mark is\n                                    protected,there exists a likelihood of confusion on the part of the public,\n                            which includes the likelihood of association with the earlier trade\n                            mark.It would be noted that the material part of the wording of this English\n                        provision (except for the last phrase “which includes the likelihood\n                        of association with the earlier trade mark”) is identical to our\n                        s 8(2) of the Act. It is also similar to our s 27(2)(b) (except again for the last phrase).Of course, this English provision (as our s 8(2)) relates\n                            to refusing the registration of a mark, rather than the infringement of\n                            an existing mark. However, we do not think this distinction should mean\n                            that the meaning to be given to s 27(2)(b) should be any different\n                            from that ascribed to s 8(2) or the equivalent English provision\n                            considered in Royal Berkshire. In addition, we also do not\n                        think that the inclusion of the ending phrase in the English provision in\n                        any way enlarges its meaning. Confusion as to trade origin is already\n                        encompassed in the earlier part of the provision: see Christopher Morcom,\n                        Ashley Roughton & James Graham,The Modern Law of\n                            Trade Marks(Butterworths, 1999 Ed) at\n                        p 208.[emphasis added]Nevertheless, where, as in the present case, there was not much\n                    evidence as to how Ozone intends to apply its mark or to distinguish its goods\n                    from AMP’s in Singapore, the consideration of factors other than the marks\n                    themselves would be limited, although the consideration of other factors was in\n                    principle permissible.88     In the course of the hearing before me, AMP\n                    produced a copy of a magazine, which was a “25th anniversary book”\n                    bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark, which had been purchased\n                    from a bookstore in Singapore in September 2009. However, in my view, this\n                    itself did not constitute much evidence about Ozone’s intentions in\n                    Singapore with its mark.89     As stated above at[19], the PAR had identified the relevant segment of the public\n                    to be “the entire group of women who read magazines for leisure and [who]\n                    are fashion conscious.” I agreed with this classification. However, I\n                    would add that as noted at [36] ofThe Polo/Lauren Co\n                        (HC):The likelihood of confusion…36    The average consumer in Singapore has been\n                            described asliterate, educated, exposed to the world\n                                and unlikely to be easily hoodwinked: (Tong Guan Food Products Pte Ltd v Hoe Huat Hng Foodstuff Pte\n                                Ltd[1991] SLR 133]([23]supra) at 143–144, [30]; and [McDonald’s(CA)] at\n                            [64]. This is the starting point. [emphasis added]90     Furthermore, in the context of the average\n                    consumerof magazinesand their purchasing habits,\n                    it has been noted inIn the Matter of Application No 2136517A\n                        in the name of IPC Magazines Limited to register a trade mark in Classes 9,\n                        16 & 35 and In the Matter of Opposition thereto under No 50532 by\n                        Liberty Media for Women LLC[note: 2]that:36. Magazines are primarily obtained by self-selection, which makes the\n                        visual appearance of the title (or trade mark) of primary importance. They\n                        are usually displayed alongside other magazines, grouped according to\n                        subject matter. It is possible that a women’s magazine could be\n                        displayed alongside, or in the proximity of one for teenagers and young\n                        women, which would afford a side-by-side comparison. I cannot, however say\n                        that that would necessarily be the case, particularly in circumstances where\n                        the magazine is obtained by subscription. There are circumstances when oral\n                        use, such as a consumer making an enquiry regarding the availability of a\n                        publication will be of relevance.Although magazines are\n                            relatively inexpensive items, the consumer is, I consider, reasonably\n                            discerning in the selection, where able, often picking up the magazine\n                            to glance through its contents prior to making the decision to\n                            purchase. [emphasis added]91     In these circumstances, given my conclusion\n                    that there wasnosimilarity between Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark and AMP’s “GLAMOUR”\n                    mark under s 8(2)(b) TMA (see[73]above), and bearing in mind the\n                    characteristics of the average consumer who would be likely to buy the goods of\n                    Ozone and AMP (see[82]-[83]and[89]above) and who would “exercise some care and good sense in making his\n                    purchases” (see[83]above), I was of\n                    the view that even for “printed matter”, let alone Ozone’s\n                    other goods, the ordinary Singaporean would have little difficulty discerning\n                    that Ozone’s goods bearing the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark are\n                    not from the same trade source or origin as AMP’s goods bearing the\n                    “GLAMOUR” mark. In this aspect, it would be useful to refer toIn the Matter of Application No 1568121 in the name of\n                        Global Spa and in the matter of Opposition thereto under No 45679 in the\n                        name of Advance Magazine Publishers Inc.[note: 3]Here,\n                    the United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office Hearing Officer, adopting a\n                    similar stance, observed as follows:Titles of magazines by their nature tend to make\n                            varying degrees of reference to their subject matter or target\n                            readership, and consequently many have a low level of distinctiveness.\n                            The word GLAMOUR is no exception. It is an ordinary and well known word\n                            in the English language which readily conveys the idea of clothing,\n                            make-up, etc, and given that the opponents say that their magazine sold\n                            under the GLAMOUR trade mark is well known for its features relating to\n                            fashion and related topics I consider that it falls into the category of\n                            a mark with a low degree of distinctiveness. I make this\n                        observation only insofar as to say that as it isnot the\n                            strongest of marks this is likely to impact on customer perception of\n                            the mark and the issue of confusion. [emphasis added]I should add that this observation was made even though the opponents\n                    in that case, AMP, had claimed, as in this case (see[7]above), that the “GLAMOUR” mark had been\n                    registered in several other countries. Furthermore, it bears mention also that,\n                    as stated at paras 10 and 11 of the statutory declaration declared in Japan on\n                    5 December 2006 by Mr Noriyuki Yamagani (see[8]above), that AMP’s “GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Printed matter (magazines, newsletters and books; computer programs);\n                        paper products (posters, paper patterns)and Ozone’s “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” mark in\n                    Class 16 covering:Paper and cardboard; industrial packaging containers of paper; towels of\n                        paper; table napkins of paper; hand towels of paper; handkerchiefs of paper;\n                        paper patterns; tailors’ chalk, table cloths of paper; blinds of\n                        paper; banners of papers; flags of paper; baggage tags; printed matter;\n                        paintings and calligraphic works; photographs, photograph stands; playing\n                        cards; stationery and study materialshave in factco-existedon the United\n                    Kingdom Trade Marks Register since 2001.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(2)(b)\n                TMA92     For all the foregoing reasons, I was thus of\n                    the view that AMP’s opposition to the registration of Ozone’s\n                    “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark in Class 16 pursuant to\n                        s 8(2)(b) TMA shouldnotsucceed. The PAR’s decision on this provision was\n                    accordinglyreversed. I now proceed to examine\n                    AMP’s opposition pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA93     As stated above at[28], AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding that the\n                    law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA.94     It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an\n                    action for passing off, it had to prove the following classical trinity of\n                    elements,viz:(a)     a goodwill or reputation attached to\n                        the goods and services it supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by\n                        association with the identifying “get-up”, such that the\n                        “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive\n                        specifically of AMP’s goods or services;(b)     a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public\n                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe\n                        that the goods offered by Ozone are the goods of AMP; and(c)     that it is likely to suffer damage by\n                        reason of the erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation\n                        that the source of its goods is the same as the source of those offered by\n                        AMP.(See the decisions of the Court of Appeal inNovelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009]\n                        3 SLR 216 (“Amanresorts”) at [36]-[37] andCity\n                            Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2009]\n                        SGCA 53 (“City Chain”)). As\n                        these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see[21]above), I needed only to examine whether\n                        the PAR had erred inapplyingthese three\n                        elements to the facts of the present case.Element 1: Goodwill or reputation95     In the submissions before me, goodwill and\n                    reputation were referred to interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer\n                    to goodwill only. The two essential features of goodwill, which is a question of\n                    fact, were summarised recently inCity Chainas\n                    follows:62 In [Amanresorts] at [39], this court held\n                        thatthe two essential features of goodwill are that\n                            “it is the association of a good, service or business on which\n                            the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been\n                            applied with a particular source” and “this association is\n                            an ‘attractive force which brings in custom’”.\n                            Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a question of fact. Relevant\n                            factors include advertising, trading, volume of sales, and whether it\n                            has been registered. But the fact that the mark or indicia is\n                        not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the\n                        plaintiff’s goods or services (seeHalsbury Laws of\n                            Singaporevol 13(3) (LexisNexis Singapore) at\n                        para 160.8172007). [emphasis added]96     It bears mention that where a case involves\n                    indicia which aredescriptiveof the goods or\n                    services in question (as in this case: see[69]above), the law imposes ahigherburden on the plaintiff (ie, AMP) when proving the existence of his goodwill. The leading\n                    decision in this aspect is that of the Court of Appeal inLifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99 SHOP)[2000] 2 SLR 766 (“Lifestyle\n                    1.99”). The facts of and principles stated in that case have\n                    been helpfully summarised inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat p 209 as follows:[17.1.15]… The plaintiff was the\n                        owner of a chain of retail shops which operate under the markONE.99 SHOP. These outlets sold goods ranging from\n                        snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and\n                        common household items. The important characteristic of the\n                        plaintiff’s business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99.\n                        The plaintiff was the first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price\n                        store’ business. About 1-½ years later, the defendant opened its\n                        retail outlets under the markLifestyle 1.99,\n                        selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to\n                        S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the\n                        markONE.99 SHOP, the Court of Appeal laid\n                        down the legal principles as follows:(a)    The law treats quite differently the mark of a\n                            business depending on whether the mark is descriptive or\n                            ‘fancy’.(b)    A mark which isprima\n                                faciedescriptive will only be protected if it can be\n                            shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it\n                            has becomes distinctive of the plaintiff’s business.\n                            ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the law of passing off. In\n                            relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes the goods of the\n                            plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders.(c)    The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean\n                            that it cannot become distinctive, although it would be difficult to\n                            prove. A very great burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove that the\n                            mark has acquired a secondary meaning.…97     In a similar vein, inJohnson & Johnson, where the registered mark was\n                    “Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was\n                    “Careree”, the court noted:24In regard to goodwill, it must\n                                [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a descriptive\n                                word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become\n                                associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to\n                                claim a monopoly of descriptive words: seeNippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paint (Singapore)\n                                Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 1 andSuper Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte\n                                Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in\n                            appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have\n                            taken on a “secondary meaning” or become\n                            “distinctive in fact”. An example is\n                            “Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that\n                            sells clothes for pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis\n                            added]98     In the present case, bearing in mind thegreaterburden of proof on AMP (in light of my\n                    earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely\n                    descriptive: see[69]above), I was of the\n                    view that the PAR haderredin concluding that\n                    there was goodwill (see[22]above). Given\n                    the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of\n                    sales (viz, the nine invoices: see[70]above) as elaborated above at[71]and the lack of evidence ofanypromotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in\n                    Singapore, it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has\n                    acquired a “secondary meaning”. As the PAR observed:88    [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from\n                            1984, but there does not seem to be good evidence that the magazines\n                            started selling in Singapore from that time, only a table and random\n                            invoices that do not date beyond the year 2000. [Ozone states] that the\n                            circulation numbers for Singapore are not impressive, 903 copies at its\n                            highest only. The Opponents have submitted that this is high relative to\n                            the numbers of other publications that are sold, as evidenced by the\n                            invoices from their distributors.However, the number\n                                903 copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low\n                                for the population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that\n                                time.…93    … [T]he circulation\n                                numbers in Singapore are unimpressive, and there is no advertising\n                                in Singapore to increase its recognition of [AMP’s]\n                                marks. [emphasis added]99     The paucity of evidence in the present case\n                    must be contrasted with the ample evidence inLifestyle\n                        1.99of the plaintiff’s goodwill. As stated inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    pp 210-211:[17.1.18]    In [Lifestyle 1.99], the plaintiff succeeded in\n                            discharging this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with\n                            the plaintiff’s sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of\n                            operation was substantial in the light of the very low price of each\n                            item), the extensive advertisements and media coverage on the\n                            plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of the people\n                            surveyed were aware or had heard of theOne.99\n                                Shopand at least 40% knew where the outlets were\n                            located. The court found that all this evidence pointed to some goodwill\n                            in the plaintiff’s business. …100    In these circumstances, I was of the view\n                    that AMP had failed to establish the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In\n                    the light of this conclusion, there was no need for me to set out my views on\n                    the second element of misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so\n                    for the sake of completeness.Element 2: Misrepresentation101    With regard to the element of\n                    misrepresentation, the learned author ofLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporenotes at p 225 (footnotes\n                    omitted):[18.0.1]The key element here is deception.\n                        The court is concerned with the following question:has\n                            the defendant made a false representation that led to, or is likely to\n                            lead, to deception or confusion amongst the public? The nature of the\n                            deception or confusion may relate to the trade source of the goods or\n                            services, or to the quality of the goods or services.\n                            …[18.0.2]Although the key element is deception, it is not\n                            necessary to prove that the defendant has an intention to deceive or\n                            mislead the public. For this reason, it has been said thatthe state of the mind of the defendant is immaterial;\n                            rather, what matters is the impact on the persons to whom the\n                            misrepresentation is addressed. If the impact on these\n                        persons is such that they would be deceived, the element of\n                        misrepresentation is made out and the defendant cannot avoid a finding of\n                        passing off by the mere fact that his goods are of as good or better quality\n                        than the plaintiff’s, or that the misrepresentation was made\n                        innocently.[emphasis added]102    It would also be useful to refer toAmanresortswhich confirms that confusion is\n                    an essential element of the tort of passing off. As stated in the\n                    headnote:(4)    On the issue of misrepresentation, thetarget audience of misrepresentation in a passing off\n                                action was the actual and potential audience of the claimant.\n                                Misrepresentation was actionable only if it caused confusion and\n                                while there was no need to showactualconfusion, the court had to assess whether there was alikelihoodof confusion from the surrounding facts,\n                                based on the average reasonable person, with characteristics\n                                reflective of the relevant section of the public.\n                            Relevant factors in this case included whether there was any fraudulent\n                            intention in using the name “Amanusa” for the housing\n                            project, and whether the business of the Appellant and the Respondents\n                            were in the same field or closely related fields. The identical\n                            names, the similar Balinese themes, and the presentation of the\n                            Appellant’s housing project as high-quality accommodation were\n                            factors increasing the likelihood of confusion… [emphasis\n                            added]103    Be that as it may, where adescriptivemark is adopted by a plaintiff, aslightdifference between the plaintiff’s mark and\n                    the defendant’s mark is sufficient to distinguish them and to undo any\n                    possibility of confusion in the mark (seeLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat p 211, para 17.1.18, andLifestyle 1.99at [39]).104    In the present case, the PAR had concluded\n                    that there was no misrepresentation because Ozone was not attempting to\n                    “mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                    goods”:101    In the present case, I have made the decision that\n                            the marks are confusingly similar for the purposes of Section 8(2).\n                            However, in paragraph 78 above, I had described that it does not appear\n                            to me, on the evidence, that there is any effort to imply that the\n                            Applicants’ mark is a spin-off mark. Each of [Ozone’s] and\n                            [AMP’s] advertising retain its own special flavour, with no\n                            attempt to copy each other’s style.This\n                                evidence also goes to show that there is clearly no\n                                misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt where [Ozone is]\n                                trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                                goods. [emphasis added]105    The PAR had made his ultimate finding that\n                    there was no misrepresentation on the basis that there was no attempt on the\n                    part of Ozone to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.\n                    This basis of the PAR’s conclusion was incorrect because with regard to\n                    the element of misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the\n                    effect of Ozone’s conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see[102]above) and there can be a\n                    misrepresentation even if it was madeinnocently(seeJohnson & Johnsonat [25]). On the other\n                    hand, Ozone’s state of mind would have been a relevant consideration in\n                    finding an increased likelihood of confusion if Ozone had been found (there was\n                    no evidence of this in this case) to have had an intention to mislead or\n                    deceive. As noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat pp 230-231:[18.4.6]Proof of an intention to deceive is\n                        not a necessary ingredient in this second element, but if such an intention\n                        is established, the burden on the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened.\n                        …106    AMP contended that the PAR had\n                    “committed a further material error of principle by restricting his\n                    analysis to whether there was any confusion…to the origin of the goods as\n                    evident from his conclusion that `there is no attempt where [Ozone was] trying\n                    to mislead or deceive the public as to theorigin of the\n                        goods’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the\n                    “PAR’s restriction of the analysis as such defies established law\n                    that confusion under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to\n                    the origin of [Ozone’s] goods”.107    I accepted thegeneralprinciple that the nature of the confusion may relate to\n                    the trade source of the goods or servicesorto\n                    the quality of the goods. As stated inLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat pp 226-228:18.2MISREPRESENTATION AS TO ORIGIN[18.2.1]The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to\n                            the trade source of the goods or services, or to the quality of the\n                            goods or services. Misrepresentation as to the trade source can take the\n                            form of a false representation that the defendant’s goods or\n                            services are those of the plaintiff, or that the two parties are\n                            connected in some way, for example, the defendant’s business is an\n                            extension, branch or other agency of the\n                        plaintiff’s.…18.3MISREPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY[18.3.1]Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of\n                            the goods or services is an element of misrepresentation about the\n                            quality of the goods or services. The consumer buying the\n                            defendant’s goods thinks that he is getting the quality that he is\n                            accustomed to finding in the plaintiff’s goods. Here\n                        the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation about thequality of his own goods.[18.3.2]It is also possible for the\n                        defendant to make a misrepresentation about the quality of theplaintiff’sgoods…[emphasis added]108    At[96]above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia which was\n                    descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on AMP in\n                    proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof isalsoextended to the element of misrepresentation, as\n                    noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat pp 230-231:18.4PROVING MISREPRESENTATION…[18.4.7]When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive\n                            connotations or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears\n                            a higher burden of proof to show goodwill is extended to the second\n                            element: the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show confusion is also\n                            heavier. The courts will readily regard a slight difference between the\n                            plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark as being\n                            sufficient to distinguish them. [Lifestyle\n                            1.99] is a classic illustration of this principle. …\n                        [emphasis added]109    In my view, it was clear however that\n                    contrary to AMP’s contention (see[106]above), the PAR hadnotrestricted his analysis to only whether there was any confusion to the origin of\n                    the goods but had also considered and rejected AMP’s argument that there\n                    had been a misrepresentation as to quality, albeit in the context of the third\n                    element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the GD cited at[24]above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of\n                    proof on the shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was\n                    of the opinion that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now\n                    move on to consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade\n                    source of the goods.110    In this case, while I accepted that the\n                    proximity of a defendant’s field of activity to a plaintiff’s is a\n                    relevant consideration in deciding whether there is likelihood of confusion (seeLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    p 231, para 18.4.8 andAmanresortsat para\n                    84), and that there wassomeproximity between\n                    Ozone’s field of activity (viz, the design\n                    and retailing offashionapparel andfashionaccessories for both men and women: see[8]above) and AMP’s field of\n                    activity (viz, the “GLAMOUR” mark\n                    primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine\n                    which is devoted to the reporting and portraying of,inter\n                        alia, contemporary women’sfashionand beauty: see[7]above) in that both relate to “fashion”, given that:(a)     the word marks of Ozone and AMP\n                        were visuallydissimilar(see[53]above) and aurallydissimilar(see[56]above);(b)     “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive andnotinherently distinctive nor distinctive by use (see[73]above);(c)     a higher burden of proof is imposed\n                        on AMP (see[108]above);\n                    and(d)     Ozone’s\n                        other goods weredifferentfrom AMP’s\n                        goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                        publications”) (see[80]above),I was of the opinion that the element of\n                    misrepresentation was also not satisfiedvis-à-visOzone’s other goods.111    With regard to “printed\n                    matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an overlap between\n                    “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the\n                    view that, on balance, the element of misrepresentation was also not made\n                    out.Element 3: Damage112    With regard to the element relating to the\n                    question of damage, this was accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were\n                    made out.Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4)\n                TMA113    For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no\n                    reason to disturb the PAR’s eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of\n                    opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not made out and must fail.Conclusion114    Given my conclusion that AMP’s\n                    opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(b)and 8(4)\n                    TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s\n                    decision dated 16 March 2009. In so doing, I ordered that:(a)     Ozone’s Trade Mark\n                        Application No T02/03173J for the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark\n                        be allowed to proceed to registration;(b)     the costs awarded to AMP in the hearing before the PAR\n                        be set aside; and(c)     the costs of this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the PAR\n                        be paid by AMP to Ozone.[note: 1]Available\n                                online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-challenge-decision-results/o31904.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 15 December 2009)[note: 2]Available\n                                online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm/t-os/t-find/t-challenge-decision-results/o16703.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 31 December 2009)[note: 3]Available online at\n                                http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o08400.pdf\n                                (last accessed on 15 December 2009)",
        "AMP’s opposition under s 8(4) TMA": "93     As stated above at[28], AMP contended that the PAR had erred in holding that the\n                    law of passing off would not prevent Ozone’s use of the “HYSTERIC\n                    GLAMOUR” word mark pursuant to s 8(4) TMA. 94     It is trite that for AMP to succeed in an\n                    action for passing off, it had to prove the following classical trinity of\n                    elements,viz: (a)     a goodwill or reputation attached to\n                        the goods and services it supplies in the mind of the purchasing public by\n                        association with the identifying “get-up”, such that the\n                        “get-up” is recognised by the public as distinctive\n                        specifically of AMP’s goods or services; (b)     a misrepresentation by Ozone to the public\n                        (whether or not intentional) leading or likely to lead the public to believe\n                        that the goods offered by Ozone are the goods of AMP; and (c)     that it is likely to suffer damage by\n                        reason of the erroneous belief engendered by Ozone’s misrepresentation\n                        that the source of its goods is the same as the source of those offered by\n                        AMP. (See the decisions of the Court of Appeal inNovelty Pte Ltd v Amanresorts Ltd and another[2009]\n                        3 SLR 216 (“Amanresorts”) at [36]-[37] andCity\n                            Chain Stores (S) Pte Ltd v Louis Vuitton Malletier[2009]\n                        SGCA 53 (“City Chain”)). As\n                        these three elements were correctly identified by the PAR (see[21]above), I needed only to examine whether\n                        the PAR had erred inapplyingthese three\n                        elements to the facts of the present case. Element 1: Goodwill or reputation 95     In the submissions before me, goodwill and\n                    reputation were referred to interchangeably. For present purposes, I will refer\n                    to goodwill only. The two essential features of goodwill, which is a question of\n                    fact, were summarised recently inCity Chainas\n                    follows: 62 In [Amanresorts] at [39], this court held\n                        thatthe two essential features of goodwill are that\n                            “it is the association of a good, service or business on which\n                            the plaintiff’s mark, name, labelling, etc … has been\n                            applied with a particular source” and “this association is\n                            an ‘attractive force which brings in custom’”.\n                            Proving goodwill or distinctiveness is a question of fact. Relevant\n                            factors include advertising, trading, volume of sales, and whether it\n                            has been registered. But the fact that the mark or indicia is\n                        not novel does not mean that it cannot be distinctive of the\n                        plaintiff’s goods or services (seeHalsbury Laws of\n                            Singaporevol 13(3) (LexisNexis Singapore) at\n                        para 160.8172007). [emphasis added] 96     It bears mention that where a case involves\n                    indicia which aredescriptiveof the goods or\n                    services in question (as in this case: see[69]above), the law imposes ahigherburden on the plaintiff (ie, AMP) when proving the existence of his goodwill. The leading\n                    decision in this aspect is that of the Court of Appeal inLifestyle 1.99 Pte Ltd v S$1.99 Pte Ltd (trading as ONE.99 SHOP)[2000] 2 SLR 766 (“Lifestyle\n                    1.99”). The facts of and principles stated in that case have\n                    been helpfully summarised inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat p 209 as follows: [17.1.15]… The plaintiff was the\n                        owner of a chain of retail shops which operate under the markONE.99 SHOP. These outlets sold goods ranging from\n                        snack and other foodstuff to cosmetics, fashion accessories, stationery and\n                        common household items. The important characteristic of the\n                        plaintiff’s business was that all these goods were priced at S$1.99.\n                        The plaintiff was the first in Singapore to start a ‘one-price\n                        store’ business. About 1-½ years later, the defendant opened its\n                        retail outlets under the markLifestyle 1.99,\n                        selling various goods sold at prices with 99 cents (S$1.99, S$3.99, to\n                        S$9.99). On the question whether the plaintiff had acquired goodwill in the\n                        markONE.99 SHOP, the Court of Appeal laid\n                        down the legal principles as follows: (a)    The law treats quite differently the mark of a\n                            business depending on whether the mark is descriptive or\n                            ‘fancy’. (b)    A mark which isprima\n                                faciedescriptive will only be protected if it can be\n                            shown to have acquired a ‘secondary meaning’, that is, it\n                            has becomes distinctive of the plaintiff’s business.\n                            ‘Distinctive’ is a term of art in the law of passing off. In\n                            relation to a mark, this means that the mark denotes the goods of the\n                            plaintiffs to the exclusion of other traders. (c)    The fact that a mark is descriptive does not mean\n                            that it cannot become distinctive, although it would be difficult to\n                            prove. A very great burden is placed on the plaintiff to prove that the\n                            mark has acquired a secondary meaning. … 97     In a similar vein, inJohnson & Johnson, where the registered mark was\n                    “Carefree” and the mark sought to be registered was\n                    “Careree”, the court noted: 24In regard to goodwill, it must\n                                [be] borne in mind that “Carefree” is a descriptive\n                                word and while it is possible for a descriptive word to become\n                                associated with goodwill, the courts are slow to allow anyone to\n                                claim a monopoly of descriptive words: seeNippon Paint (Singapore) Co Pte Ltd v ICI Paint (Singapore)\n                                Pte Ltd[2001] 1 SLR 1 andSuper Coffeemix Manufacturing Ltd v Unico Trading Pte\n                                Ltd[2000] 3 SLR 145. All the same, in\n                            appropriate cases, the courts have held that descriptive words have\n                            taken on a “secondary meaning” or become\n                            “distinctive in fact”. An example is\n                            “Mothercare”, which is synonymous with the company that\n                            sells clothes for pregnant women and young children. … [emphasis\n                            added] 98     In the present case, bearing in mind thegreaterburden of proof on AMP (in light of my\n                    earlier finding that the “GLAMOUR” word mark is purely\n                    descriptive: see[69]above), I was of the\n                    view that the PAR haderredin concluding that\n                    there was goodwill (see[22]above). Given\n                    the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence tendered by AMP to show volume of\n                    sales (viz, the nine invoices: see[70]above) as elaborated above at[71]and the lack of evidence ofanypromotions or advertisements undertaken by AMP in\n                    Singapore, it cannot be said that the “GLAMOUR” word mark has\n                    acquired a “secondary meaning”. As the PAR observed: 88    [AMP claims] that the use in Singapore started from\n                            1984, but there does not seem to be good evidence that the magazines\n                            started selling in Singapore from that time, only a table and random\n                            invoices that do not date beyond the year 2000. [Ozone states] that the\n                            circulation numbers for Singapore are not impressive, 903 copies at its\n                            highest only. The Opponents have submitted that this is high relative to\n                            the numbers of other publications that are sold, as evidenced by the\n                            invoices from their distributors.However, the number\n                                903 copies sounds to me like a number that is disproportionately low\n                                for the population of Singapore that is around 3 million at that\n                                time. … 93    … [T]he circulation\n                                numbers in Singapore are unimpressive, and there is no advertising\n                                in Singapore to increase its recognition of [AMP’s]\n                                marks. [emphasis added] 99     The paucity of evidence in the present case\n                    must be contrasted with the ample evidence inLifestyle\n                        1.99of the plaintiff’s goodwill. As stated inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    pp 210-211: [17.1.18]    In [Lifestyle 1.99], the plaintiff succeeded in\n                            discharging this higher burden of proof. The court was impressed with\n                            the plaintiff’s sales turnover (S$10.4m in the first two years of\n                            operation was substantial in the light of the very low price of each\n                            item), the extensive advertisements and media coverage on the\n                            plaintiff’s business, and the fact that some 48% of the people\n                            surveyed were aware or had heard of theOne.99\n                                Shopand at least 40% knew where the outlets were\n                            located. The court found that all this evidence pointed to some goodwill\n                            in the plaintiff’s business. … 100    In these circumstances, I was of the view\n                    that AMP had failed to establish the element of goodwill (see [94(a)] above). In\n                    the light of this conclusion, there was no need for me to set out my views on\n                    the second element of misrepresentation (see [94(b)] above) but I shall do so\n                    for the sake of completeness. Element 2: Misrepresentation 101    With regard to the element of\n                    misrepresentation, the learned author ofLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporenotes at p 225 (footnotes\n                    omitted): [18.0.1]The key element here is deception.\n                        The court is concerned with the following question:has\n                            the defendant made a false representation that led to, or is likely to\n                            lead, to deception or confusion amongst the public? The nature of the\n                            deception or confusion may relate to the trade source of the goods or\n                            services, or to the quality of the goods or services.\n                            … [18.0.2]Although the key element is deception, it is not\n                            necessary to prove that the defendant has an intention to deceive or\n                            mislead the public. For this reason, it has been said thatthe state of the mind of the defendant is immaterial;\n                            rather, what matters is the impact on the persons to whom the\n                            misrepresentation is addressed. If the impact on these\n                        persons is such that they would be deceived, the element of\n                        misrepresentation is made out and the defendant cannot avoid a finding of\n                        passing off by the mere fact that his goods are of as good or better quality\n                        than the plaintiff’s, or that the misrepresentation was made\n                        innocently. [emphasis added] 102    It would also be useful to refer toAmanresortswhich confirms that confusion is\n                    an essential element of the tort of passing off. As stated in the\n                    headnote: (4)    On the issue of misrepresentation, thetarget audience of misrepresentation in a passing off\n                                action was the actual and potential audience of the claimant.\n                                Misrepresentation was actionable only if it caused confusion and\n                                while there was no need to showactualconfusion, the court had to assess whether there was alikelihoodof confusion from the surrounding facts,\n                                based on the average reasonable person, with characteristics\n                                reflective of the relevant section of the public.\n                            Relevant factors in this case included whether there was any fraudulent\n                            intention in using the name “Amanusa” for the housing\n                            project, and whether the business of the Appellant and the Respondents\n                            were in the same field or closely related fields. The identical\n                            names, the similar Balinese themes, and the presentation of the\n                            Appellant’s housing project as high-quality accommodation were\n                            factors increasing the likelihood of confusion… [emphasis\n                            added] 103    Be that as it may, where adescriptivemark is adopted by a plaintiff, aslightdifference between the plaintiff’s mark and\n                    the defendant’s mark is sufficient to distinguish them and to undo any\n                    possibility of confusion in the mark (seeLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat p 211, para 17.1.18, andLifestyle 1.99at [39]). 104    In the present case, the PAR had concluded\n                    that there was no misrepresentation because Ozone was not attempting to\n                    “mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                    goods”: 101    In the present case, I have made the decision that\n                            the marks are confusingly similar for the purposes of Section 8(2).\n                            However, in paragraph 78 above, I had described that it does not appear\n                            to me, on the evidence, that there is any effort to imply that the\n                            Applicants’ mark is a spin-off mark. Each of [Ozone’s] and\n                            [AMP’s] advertising retain its own special flavour, with no\n                            attempt to copy each other’s style.This\n                                evidence also goes to show that there is clearly no\n                                misrepresentation here, as there is no attempt where [Ozone is]\n                                trying to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the\n                                goods. [emphasis added] 105    The PAR had made his ultimate finding that\n                    there was no misrepresentation on the basis that there was no attempt on the\n                    part of Ozone to mislead or deceive the public as to the origin of the goods.\n                    This basis of the PAR’s conclusion was incorrect because with regard to\n                    the element of misrepresentation, what the courts are concerned with is the\n                    effect of Ozone’s conduct on the actual and potential audience of AMP (see[102]above) and there can be a\n                    misrepresentation even if it was madeinnocently(seeJohnson & Johnsonat [25]). On the other\n                    hand, Ozone’s state of mind would have been a relevant consideration in\n                    finding an increased likelihood of confusion if Ozone had been found (there was\n                    no evidence of this in this case) to have had an intention to mislead or\n                    deceive. As noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in\n                        Singaporeat pp 230-231: [18.4.6]Proof of an intention to deceive is\n                        not a necessary ingredient in this second element, but if such an intention\n                        is established, the burden on the plaintiff to show confusion is lessened.\n                        … 106    AMP contended that the PAR had\n                    “committed a further material error of principle by restricting his\n                    analysis to whether there was any confusion…to the origin of the goods as\n                    evident from his conclusion that `there is no attempt where [Ozone was] trying\n                    to mislead or deceive the public as to theorigin of the\n                        goods’. [emphasis added]. According to AMP, the\n                    “PAR’s restriction of the analysis as such defies established law\n                    that confusion under the law of passing off is not limited to confusion as to\n                    the origin of [Ozone’s] goods”. 107    I accepted thegeneralprinciple that the nature of the confusion may relate to\n                    the trade source of the goods or servicesorto\n                    the quality of the goods. As stated inLaw of Intellectual\n                        Property in Singaporeat pp 226-228: 18.2MISREPRESENTATION AS TO ORIGIN [18.2.1]The nature of the deception or confusion may relate to\n                            the trade source of the goods or services, or to the quality of the\n                            goods or services. Misrepresentation as to the trade source can take the\n                            form of a false representation that the defendant’s goods or\n                            services are those of the plaintiff, or that the two parties are\n                            connected in some way, for example, the defendant’s business is an\n                            extension, branch or other agency of the\n                        plaintiff’s. … 18.3MISREPRESENTATION AS TO QUALITY [18.3.1]Inherent within a misrepresentation as to the source of\n                            the goods or services is an element of misrepresentation about the\n                            quality of the goods or services. The consumer buying the\n                            defendant’s goods thinks that he is getting the quality that he is\n                            accustomed to finding in the plaintiff’s goods. Here\n                        the objection is that the defendant is making a misrepresentation about thequality of his own goods. [18.3.2]It is also possible for the\n                        defendant to make a misrepresentation about the quality of theplaintiff’sgoods… [emphasis added] 108    At[96]above, I had stated that because the present case involved indicia which was\n                    descriptive of the goods in question, a higher burden was imposed on AMP in\n                    proving the existence of goodwill. This higher burden of proof isalsoextended to the element of misrepresentation, as\n                    noted inLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat pp 230-231: 18.4PROVING MISREPRESENTATION … [18.4.7]When the plaintiff’s mark or get-up has descriptive\n                            connotations or functional value, the principle that the plaintiff bears\n                            a higher burden of proof to show goodwill is extended to the second\n                            element: the burden of proof on the plaintiff to show confusion is also\n                            heavier. The courts will readily regard a slight difference between the\n                            plaintiff’s mark and the defendant’s mark as being\n                            sufficient to distinguish them. [Lifestyle\n                            1.99] is a classic illustration of this principle. …\n                        [emphasis added] 109    In my view, it was clear however that\n                    contrary to AMP’s contention (see[106]above), the PAR hadnotrestricted his analysis to only whether there was any confusion to the origin of\n                    the goods but had also considered and rejected AMP’s argument that there\n                    had been a misrepresentation as to quality, albeit in the context of the third\n                    element of “damage” (see [103]-[105] of the GD cited at[24]above). Bearing in mind the higher burden of\n                    proof on the shoulders of AMP and the PAR’s finding in this aspect, I was\n                    of the opinion that there had been no misrepresentation as to quality. I now\n                    move on to consider whether there had been a misrepresentation as to the trade\n                    source of the goods. 110    In this case, while I accepted that the\n                    proximity of a defendant’s field of activity to a plaintiff’s is a\n                    relevant consideration in deciding whether there is likelihood of confusion (seeLaw of Intellectual Property in Singaporeat\n                    p 231, para 18.4.8 andAmanresortsat para\n                    84), and that there wassomeproximity between\n                    Ozone’s field of activity (viz, the design\n                    and retailing offashionapparel andfashionaccessories for both men and women: see[8]above) and AMP’s field of\n                    activity (viz, the “GLAMOUR” mark\n                    primarily being used in conjunction with the “GLAMOUR” magazine\n                    which is devoted to the reporting and portraying of,inter\n                        alia, contemporary women’sfashionand beauty: see[7]above) in that both relate to “fashion”, given that: (a)     the word marks of Ozone and AMP\n                        were visuallydissimilar(see[53]above) and aurallydissimilar(see[56]above); (b)     “GLAMOUR” is merely descriptive andnotinherently distinctive nor distinctive by use (see[73]above); (c)     a higher burden of proof is imposed\n                        on AMP (see[108]above);\n                    and (d)     Ozone’s\n                        other goods weredifferentfrom AMP’s\n                        goods (viz, “magazines books and\n                        publications”) (see[80]above), I was of the opinion that the element of\n                    misrepresentation was also not satisfiedvis-à-visOzone’s other goods. 111    With regard to “printed\n                    matter”, bearing in mind Ozone’s concession of an overlap between\n                    “printed matter” and AMP’s “magazines, books and\n                    publications” but taking into account [110(a)]-[110(c)], I was of the\n                    view that, on balance, the element of misrepresentation was also not made\n                    out. Element 3: Damage 112    With regard to the element relating to the\n                    question of damage, this was accepted by Ozone if the first two elements were\n                    made out. Overall conclusion on AMP’s opposition under s 8(4)\n                TMA 113    For all the foregoing reasons, I saw no\n                    reason to disturb the PAR’s eventual conclusion that AMP’s ground of\n                    opposition under s 8(4) TMA was not made out and must fail.",
        "Conclusion": "114    Given my conclusion that AMP’s\n                    opposition pursuant to ss 8(2)(b)and 8(4)\n                    TMA must fail , I allowed Ozone’s appeal and reversed the PAR’s\n                    decision dated 16 March 2009. In so doing, I ordered that: (a)     Ozone’s Trade Mark\n                        Application No T02/03173J for the “HYSTERIC GLAMOUR” word mark\n                        be allowed to proceed to registration; (b)     the costs awarded to AMP in the hearing before the PAR\n                        be set aside; and (c)     the costs of this appeal and the costs of the hearing before the PAR\n                        be paid by AMP to Ozone.
