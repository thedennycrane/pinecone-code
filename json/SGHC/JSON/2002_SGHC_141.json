        "The Gang": "1.        The first accused Fazely\n\nBin Rahmat (also known as \"Pendek\") and the second accused Khairul Famy Bin Mohd\n\nSamsudin (also known as \"Fami\") are 20 and 19 years old respectively. They\n\nbelonged to a secret society known by the numerical name of \"369\". They were\n\nboth charged for the murder of one Sulaiman Bin Hashim, a 17-year old boy whom the two\n\naccused and their fellow gang members mistook to be a member of a rival gang. The two\n\naccused were initially charged together with a third member of their gang, Hasik Bin\n\nSahar, but on the first day of the trial the prosecution reduced the charge against the\n\nlatter to culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Hasik decided to plead guilty to the\n\namended charge and was taken to another court to be dealt with. He was subsequently\n\nsentenced to life imprisonment. The trial of the first and second accused then continued\n\nbefore me. Two other members of the gang, Mohamad Fahmi Bin Abdul Shukor (known as\n\n\"Fahmi\") and Mohammad Ridzwan Bin Samad (known as \"Chemong\"), were\n\nsentenced in the subordinate courts to three years' imprisonment and six strokes of the\n\ncane each for their involvement in the attack on Sulaiman. Three other members Muhammad\n\nSyamsul Ariffin (known as \"Aki\"), Norisham Bin Mohammad Dahlan (known as\n\n\"Baby\"), and Sharlhawazi Bin Ramy (known as Boy Sharul\") were still at\n\nlarge when this trial commenced. Two other members of the gang were not involved in the\n\nassault as they had gone home after the party. They were Mohamad Khairsofian (known as\n\n\"Pian\") and Sophian (known as \"Yan\").",
        "The Assault On Sulaiman": "2.        On 31 May 2001 Sulaiman\n\nand two of his friends, Muhamad Sharif and Mohamed Imran, were walking along the footpath\n\noutsideBernie Goes To Town, a public house (commonly referred to as a 'pub'), at\n\nSouth Bridge Road about 4 o'clock in the morning. The two accused together with four of\n\ntheir friends were walking on the opposite side of the road and in the opposite direction.\n\nThe accused and their friends had just celebrated Aki's birthday atClub 7at\n\nMohamad Sultan Road, and arrived at South Bridge Road. The members of the accused\n\npersons’ gang spotted Sulaiman and his friends on the opposite side of the road\n\n(South Bridge Road), so they crossed the road just behind Sulaiman's party. This gang\n\n(without Chemong and Fahmi) caught up with Sulaiman and his friends just outsideBernie\n\nGoes To Townand attacked them. Muhamad Sharif and Mohamed Imran fled for their lives\n\nbut not before Muhamad Sharif was assaulted and stabbed. When these two (Sharif and Imran)\n\nreturned to the scene in a taxi a short time later, they saw Sulaiman lying in a pool of\n\nblood at the spot where they were attacked. Sulaiman was later pronounced dead at the\n\nscene. The pathologist Dr. Paul Chui testified that Sulaiman's death was caused by stab\n\nwounds to the neck and chest. He also testified that the wounds were consistent with those\n\ninflicted by a knife with a single sharp blade, possibly similar to the knife recovered by\n\nthe police (P44) from a rented flat occupied by Aki, Baby, Chemong, and Hasik.",
        "The Prosecution Case": "3.        The prosecution case\n\nagainst the two accused was founded on the premise that they were part of a gang who had a\n\ncommon object to attack Sulaiman with dangerous weapons and cause him grievous hurt.\n\nNeither accused disputed the evidence that they were part of the gang that attacked\n\nSulaiman and his two friends. However, they denied stabbing Sulaiman and only admitted to\n\npunching and kicking him. Their defence was that others in the gang stabbed Sulaiman, but\n\nthe two accused claimed that they did not know that knives were carried by the others nor\n\nhad they formed any intention to use them.4.        Several statements of the\n\ntwo accused were admitted in evidence. One of which, namely the statement of the first\n\naccused recorded on 28 June 2001 was admitted only after avoir dire. The first\n\naccused challenged the admissibility of the statement on the ground that it was not made\n\nvoluntarily. His reasons were not sufficiently strong to convince me that it was unsafe to\n\nadmit it in evidence. He claimed that as he was dressed in T-shirt and shorts he was\n\nfeeling unbearably cold. He also testified that the recording officer (ASP Goh Boon Tat)\n\ntold him not to lie and that he (ASP Goh Boon Tat) had sent many people to the gallows and\n\nthat he could send the first accused to the gallows within a week. He was also told by ASP\n\nGoh that the judge would not believe him if he said that he did not kick Sulaiman. The\n\nfirst accused then said that ASP Goh provided most of the information and \"seemed to\n\nbe copying from a piece of paper\". All this evidence seemed very disjointed and, in\n\nmy view, little in what was said created any impression of duress or oppression operating\n\non the mind of the first accused. The thrust of his case, however, was that the first\n\naccused was feeling very cold during the recording of the statement. I accept that the\n\nroom in which the statement was recorded was cold. The interpreter Iskander Goh admitted\n\nas much, but he did not think that it was so cold that the first accused would be feeling\n\nany discomfort. Iskander Goh, was, on his own evidence, warmly dressed with his sweater\n\non, and may not be best placed to assess how the accused felt. However, the first accused\n\ndid not protest that he was so cold that he could not carry on with the interview. I\n\naccept that the accused was probably cold and may not be as sharp or alert as he might\n\notherwise be in order to check or clarify his statement, but I do not think that the\n\nstatement was not made voluntarily. I am satisfied that the statement was given without\n\nany threat, inducement or promise and admitted it in evidence. The statements of the two\n\naccused contain admissions that they, together with four others (including Hasik and Aki),\n\ntook part in the assault on Sulaiman. On all the evidence above, I called upon the defence\n\nand both accused elected to testify.",
        "The Defence Case": "5.        They testified that they\n\ndid not know that Baby, the leader of their gang, and Aki were armed and they did not know\n\nor expected weapons to be used. In short, they asserted that the common object of the gang\n\nwas to beat up members of rival gangs should they encounter them in the course of the\n\nmorning. They denied that they had any common object with the others to kill or use any\n\ndangerous weapon. There was no evidence to contradict this evidence that neither of them\n\nwas armed with either knife or dagger, or any similar weapon. The evidence from both\n\naccused had consistently been that the fatal wounds were caused by either Baby, Aki, and\n\nBoy Sharul or any one of the three. The first accused, however, admitted that he had used\n\na wallet chain (made for the purpose of hooking one's wallet at one end and the belt loop\n\nof his trousers at the other) in an attempt to hit Sulaiman, but the attempt failed\n\nbecause the chain hit Baby on the arm and broke when it fell to the ground. I had examined\n\nthe broken pieces and am satisfied that the wallet chain did not seem to be sufficiently\n\nlethal to be ascribed as a dangerous weapon. There is no evidence that this wallet chain\n\nwas brought along specifically as a weapon. That the first accused had used it and not\n\njust his fists and feet (like the second accused) is a factor to be taken into account. It\n\nis also not disputed that the fatal wounds were caused by daggers or knives, and not by\n\nthis chain.",
        "The Common Object": "6.        The charge against the two\n\naccused indicts them as \"members of an unlawful assemblywhose common object was\n\nto cause hurt with dangerous weaponsto members of the '303' Secret\n\nSociety…\". I have emphasized the relevant portion because that is the critical\n\nmental element that constitutes the backbone of the charge of murder in this case. I have\n\nto begin with the observation that the prosecution was unsure as to how to make the\n\nconnection between this important element and the evidence. I will explain, but it is\n\nnecessary first, to refer to the learned DPP's written submission where he asked (at page\n\n7), \"Was there a pre-arranged plan to beat up rival gang members? And were the First\n\n[and Second] Accused aware of this plan?\". Then he asked (at page 11), \"Were the\n\nFirst [and Second] Accused aware of the use of knives? And at what stage did they come to\n\nknow of the knives?\" The third major question posed by the learned DPP (at page 15)\n\nwas, \"Upon realising that knives were being used, what role did the First [and\n\nSecond] Accused play in the attack?\". The DPP then proceeded to answer these\n\nquestions. In regard to the first question, the DPP was very meticulous in trawling the\n\nevidence to establish the 'purpose' of the gang, which he summarised in these words,\n\n\"to beat up the rival gang members\". He submitted that \"at no time was\n\nthere a change of plan\". Referring to Khairul's statement marked as P107, the DPP\n\npointed out that the second accused admitted \"that the purpose was to go there and\n\nfight\". However, he also submitted that s 149 \"does not require proof of a\n\npre-arranged plan. An unlawful object could develop suddenly, on the spot after the\n\noffenders gather at the scene of the occurrence.\"7.        I shall pause at this\n\njuncture to consider this aspect more fully before continuing with the other questions\n\nposed by the learned DPP. The DPP is absolutely right in so far as the evidence, including\n\nthe admissions of both accused in their statements and oral evidence in court, are\n\nconcerned. The common object of the gang as verbally articulated by their leader\n\n\"Baby\" was to go toRootz Discotheque(which is nearBernie Goes To\n\nTown) to look for rival gang members. This was understood by the gang to mean beating\n\nthem up. There has been no evidence from that moment, up to the time the gang accosted\n\nSulaiman, that weapons of any kind were discussed or contemplated. Up to that point, as\n\nthe DPP pointed out, there was no change in their plan. The difference between the object\n\nof picking a fight and attacking the intended quarry with dangerous weapons is too stark\n\nand serious to disregard or to give it scant attention. From the evidence, I am satisfied\n\nthat the common object of the entire gang, other than the two who went home, but including\n\nthe two who went to scout for get-away taxis, was to find rival gang members to beat up.\n\nUp to this juncture, there is no basis to add in the wordswith dangerous weapons.\n\nThe evidence does not support it.",
        "One Or Two Common Objects?": "8.        The next step in the\n\nanalysis of the evidence, in view of the fact that knives were used in the actual assault,\n\nis to enquire when, if at all, a new and separate common object was formed by those at the\n\nscene to attack Sulaiman and his friends with knives; and if so, did the two accused share\n\nthis new common object. It is at this stage of the analysis that the question as to when,\n\nif at all, the two accused were aware that knives were being used by other members of the\n\ngang (it is not disputed that the two accused themselves did not use any knife) becomes\n\nrelevant. This factual issue is relevant because a new or different common object can be\n\nformed at any point in time. Short of an express declaration, as was the case in the\n\noriginal common object, the evidence of the events from the time the gang spotted Sulaiman\n\nmust be scrutinized to ascertain whether they sufficiently support the formation of a new\n\ncommon object (to use dangerous weapons). In this regard, as I have mentioned, it is not\n\nclear what the prosecution case is. Is it based on the premise that the common object was\n\nformed when the gang was still at Mohamad Sultan Road where they were celebrating Aki's\n\nbirthday, or a new common object was formed by the gang? If it was the latter, it is also\n\nnot clear as to when and how this new object was formed. The DPP's submission seems to\n\nwaver between one and the other. For instance, Mr. Ng submitted emphatically that \"at\n\nno time was there a change of plan by Baby\". Was he suggesting that the common object\n\nto use knives was formed at the outset - before the gang arrived atBernie Goes To Town?\n\nExpanding on his written submission, Mr. Ng maintained that the prosecution was not\n\nrelying on the 'second limb\" of s 149 of the Penal Code, that is, that the accused\n\nknew that the offence of murder was likely to be committed. In other words, his case rests\n\non the premise that the accused are culpable because they shared the same common object to\n\ncause hurt with dangerous weapons. This meant, of course, that the two accused must have\n\nshared the knowledge and intention of the gang's common object. Pausing here, it is plain\n\nthat on this premise, it would not matter whether the two accused actually saw the knives\n\nbeing used or that the knives were used only after the two accused had done their part of\n\nbeating the victim. However, the bulk of Mr. Ng's submission focussed on the argument that\n\nknives were drawn by one or more members of the gang after they accosted Sulaiman, and\n\nthat the two accused knew that knives were aware that the knives were drawn when they (the\n\ntwo accused) were assaulting Sulaiman. This argument is relevant only if it is in support\n\nof a submission that a new common object was formed after the gang arrived atBernie\n\nGoes To Town, but Ng stopped short of saying that a new common object superseded the\n\nold.",
        "Original Common Object": "9.        The evidence from the\n\nprosecution and the defence indicates that the original common object was to pick a fight\n\nwith such rival gang members as they may find. It is a question of semantics whether\n\n\"picking a fight\" is a more accurate description than \"beating them\n\nup\". The evidence suggests that the more accurate description is the former. The\n\nlatter is merely a more optimistic version of the latter. (I am using the more neutral\n\nversion of \"picking a fight\"). Fazely was told by Baby in the taxi on the way to\n\nSouth Bridge Road, that they were going to \"hit\" and \"attack\" their\n\nrival gang. In their statements to the police Khairul and Hasik say that Baby merely\n\ncommanded them to proceed toRootz, and although no other words were used they\n\nunderstood him to mean that they were going there to look for a fight with their rival\n\ngang, or to beat them up. But certainly no reference was made with regard to any weapon.\n\nIt is axiomatic that an unlawful assembly may form a common object at any point in time.\n\nBoth accused also testified that they had been involved in previous fights with rival\n\ngangs but no weapons were used. There is no evidence that the common object as formed when\n\nthe gang leftClub 7was to pick a fightwith dangerous weapons. I do not\n\nthink that just because one or more of the relatively large gang had drawn daggers or\n\nknives at the scene of crime that the natural inference must be that the common object,\n\nright from the beginning, was to use the knives. The evidence must be considered and\n\nweighed in totality. I shall revert to the evaluation of the evidence shortly, but for the\n\nmoment, I should state my finding that the original common object was merely to pick a\n\nfight without the use of dangerous weapons. The question that follows, is whether a new\n\ncommon object was formed at the time of the assault?",
        "New Common Object": "10.        In the situation as the\n\nfacts have presented, two equally contentious possibilities emerge. First, even if one or\n\nmore members had knives, there may not be a new common object in that the others may not\n\nhave seen them so armed, or, if they had, may nonetheless, not have shared the same object\n\nof using it on the victim. Secondly, it may be possible that the other members became\n\naware that some of them had drawn, and support the use of those knives - in that case a\n\ncommon object to, among other things, use the knives, may be formed. This is, of course,\n\njust a concise description of the possible situations, each of which are constituted under\n\nits own facts. Knowledge that a knife had been taken out and used in the assault is,\n\nnaturally, strong evidence of a concurring mind, although it does not necessarily lead to\n\nan irresistible inference that that is so. To draw such an inference without more is a\n\nmere exercise in logic; narrowly applied, disregarding reasons and explanations. That is\n\nneither a careful nor thoughtful approach, and the fact finding exercise will thus be\n\nreduced to the adoption of the formulaic expression: \"Knife drawn + knowledge =\n\ncommon object to use knife\". The inference of that common object should only be made\n\nafter all relevant evidence are considered and weighed. The detail is as important as the\n\nbroad picture. Fact finding in a trial is a complex, but not a complicated exercise. What\n\nthen, is the evidence in this case, and how should it be evaluated?",
        "Some Salient Evidence": "11.        I begin with an\n\nindubitable piece of evidence pertaining to the actual assault. That is that one of\n\nSulaiman's companions (Muhamad Sharif) was stabbed very early on in the encounter between\n\nthe two groups, suggesting that a knife was used very early on. However, Muhamad Sharif\n\nwas unable to say who used the knife, how it was used, and neither did he see the knife.\n\nIf Muhamad Sharif who was a victim of the knife attack did not see the knife, did anyone\n\nelse see it? It is possible that someone might have. In his testimony the first accused\n\ndenied seeing any knife (this would put him in the same category as Muhamad Sharif, that\n\nis, present at scene but did not see a knife). However, in his statement to the police\n\n(P100) his version gave a different account. He explained in court how that discrepancy\n\ncame about. He testified that when he gave his statement while in remand he was told (by\n\nthe investigating officer) how the incident took place, and was asked to confirm that\n\nstory. He testified that in court, he felt that \"he was allowed to give the whole\n\nnarration freely\".12.        The second accused\n\ntestified that he saw Aki stab Sulaiman, but that he (the second accused) had already\n\nstopped his assault on Sulaiman and had backed off. In his statement to the police (P106)\n\nhe stated in  8 that he saw Aki, and Baby stabbing Sulaiman, but after the second\n\naccused had ceased his own assault on Sulaiman. It should be noted, for completeness, that\n\nin his statement to the police, Hasik described the crucial sequence in the following\n\npassage (19), relied on by the DPP:\"On reaching the spot where Baby was, I saw the male Malay, who\n\n    was in a black shirt lying on his back at the step of the stairs leading to a pub. Baby\n\n    was stabbing the male Malay at his head. Boy Sharul was slashing the male Malay on his\n\n    neck. As for Pendek [the first accused], I saw him took out his chain-belt from his jeans\n\n    and swung (sic) it at the male Malay. Khairul Fami was the first to reach them and he\n\n    shouted \"Tepi!-Tepi!\" which means to 'move aside'. Thereafter Khairul Fami\n\n    [corrected from 'Pendek'] moved aside and Aki kicked the person on his face and also\n\n    punches the face of the person. Following this I saw Khairul Fami [corrected from\n\n    'Pendek'] moved aside and Aki together with Baby were stabbing the person on his head and\n\n    neck. Boy Sharul then shouted to leave. We then moved away from the said\n\n    place….\" (sic)13.        The two accused were\n\ncharged with a capital offence because on the facts, it appears that whoever plunged the\n\nknife into Sulaiman had committed murder. The two accused will share the burden of that\n\nguilt if they had shared a common object with the wielder of the knife - but not, if they\n\ndid not. The facts in this case are significantly different from that inPP v Thongthot\n\nYorsad-Artcase (CC 3 of 2002, unreported). In theThongthotcase, six men all\n\narmed, with an assortment of deadly weapons, went searching for a specific target with the\n\nintention of assaulting him using the weapons they carried. The common object was easily\n\nproved in that case. In the present case, not every one was armed, and there is no\n\nevidence that the two accused knew who in the gang was armed, let alone the knowledge that\n\nweapons would be used. The evidence was that in all the previous fights that they had\n\nengaged in, no weapons were used. It is true that we only have the words of the two\n\naccused for this, but their evidence on this score was not contradicted by evidence of any\n\nprevious antecedents and I am prepared to accept their evidence on this score.14.        Another significant piece\n\nof evidence is that the assault took place in the early hours of the morning where there\n\nwas no natural light, and the assault was over very quickly. To these it may reasonably be\n\nadded that as may be expected of an ambush by six men on three, that the occasion was not\n\norderly, and the mayhem was a question of degree. The evidence of what took place exactly\n\nat the assault must, therefore, be considered in this context.",
        "Evaluation Of Evidence And Submissions": "15.        The learned DPP submitted\n\n(at  67 of his submission) that \"the first accused condoned the action of the rest\n\nof his gang members. They started the fight together and they finished the fight together\n\nand went away from the scene together. The common object to beat up the victim did not\n\nchange or diminished by the fact of the first accused walking away. It merely meant that\n\nthe first accused left it to the others to finish the job. If the others were to kill the\n\nvictim, the first accused should therefore also shoulder the legal consequences of the\n\ndastardly act.\" This line omits the all-important bridge between premise and\n\nconclusion namely,the common object. A common object to pick a fight without\n\nweapons may not have the same consequences, factual or legal, as one in which the use of\n\ndangerous weapons was contemplated. The DPP further concluded (in  75) that \"the\n\ncommon object of causing hurt to the victim with dangerous weapons is clearly made out.\n\nThe consequence of the attack was the death of the deceased\". In my view, this is a\n\ncompletely erroneous conclusion. What was clearly made out was a common object to pick a\n\nfight or beat up some rival gang members. At the fight (or more accurately, the assault),\n\ndangerous weapons were used bysomeof the gang. The victim died from wounds\n\ninflicted by those weapons. But we return to the question that will not go away -did a\n\nnew common object supplant the original one?16.        The only evidence that\n\nthe prosecution relied upon to support its case (that there was a common object to use\n\ndangerous weapons) are the statements of the accused persons to the police that indicated\n\nthat they had kicked Sulaiman after he had already been stabbed. The inference that the\n\nDPP draws from this, and which he wishes me to find as a fact, is that this evidence\n\nestablishes the common object. It is important to remind ourselves that even if the\n\nwritten statements are accepted as stating the truth of what happened, specifically,\n\nnamely that the two accused persons carried out their parts in the assault even after the\n\narmed members had drawn their knives, the prosecution has still to prove that a common\n\nobject to do so had been formed. The one does not follow the other as a matter of course.\n\nThe question as to whether the two accused or either of them had formed a new common\n\nobject with their knife-wielding friends is one that must be answered by the evaluation of\n\nall the evidence, each in detail, and all in connection with one another, without losing\n\nsight of the context and circumstances of the events. The statements of the accused\n\npersons, and their oral evidence are, therefore, parts of the essential material for\n\nconsideration. In this case, there is a manifest discrepancy - the oral testimonies in\n\ncourt contradict the written statements to the police in so far as to the moment when\n\nknives were drawn. Mr. Ng argues that the statements contain the truth, and that the oral\n\ntestimonies are lies because they are inconsistent with the written statements. This is,\n\nof course, too simplistic an approach. Written statements to the police was once\n\ninadmissible because of the thinking that a man ought not to incriminate himself. That\n\nline was modified when it became accepted view that the evil we wish to avoid is the\n\ncoercion of the accused and not his statement. Hence, the rules were changed so that\n\nstatements of the accused are admissible if the court is satisfied that they were made\n\nvoluntarily. But it does not follow that once the court admits the statement into evidence\n\nit stands as incontrovertible evidence - just because the court is of the view that it was\n\nnot made under a threat, inducement or promise (as the courts have defined them to be).\n\nThe statement becomes another piece of the evidence before the court. What is stated may\n\nor may not be true. That is what the court has to consider, like any other evidence before\n\nit. There are two more points to be made in this regard. First, even when a statement has\n\nbeen admitted in evidence, the maker is entitled to explain what he said and why he said\n\nwhat he said. Secondly, the court's finding of guilt or otherwise does not depend solely\n\non whether the statements carry the truth although it must be recognised that, generally,\n\na written statement forms a forceful piece of evidence unless the persuasiveness of the\n\nexplanation matches that force, but there is little point in listening to the oral\n\nexplanation if the written statement is to be preferred as a matter of course.17.        The 'incriminating' (from\n\nthe prosecution's point of view) statements in this case are sparse; no more than a\n\nparagraph or two, and the oral evidence, including that under cross-examination is not\n\nmuch more; but there is nothing exceptional about this. The point in issue, crucial as it\n\nmay be, is a very narrow one. Taking all the evidence into account, I find little\n\ndifficulty in finding that the attack took place swiftly and was over very quickly.\n\nAlthough the DPP takes the view that there was adequate light for the knives to be seen\n\nclearly, I think that it is not unreasonable to accept the accused person's contention\n\nthat the lighting was poor. It may be sufficient for the knives to be seen clearly, but it\n\nmay not be sufficient for the knives to be clearly seen. This is not intended as a play on\n\nwords. I shall explain. Taking a step back to consider from a broader perspective, the\n\ncircumstances in which the attack took place, one must recall that there was a fairly\n\nlarge group of people involved (although a few began to run away and others gave chase) in\n\nan incident occurring under a street lamp as opposed to natural light, the action was\n\nswift as it was furious. It was not the sort of occasion where those involved (on either\n\nside) had the luxury of time nor the comfort of safety to observe in detail what the\n\nothers were doing. I had considered the evidence of the accused persons against this\n\nbackground, and am of the view that there was nothing in the way or manner of their\n\ntestimony that disinclines me from granting them the benefit of doubt. This is a case\n\nwhich, but for the inconsistency in their written statements, I would have said that I\n\nbelieve their testimonies. Nonetheless, even after taking their written statements into\n\naccount, there is still a reasonable doubt in my mind as to whether the two accused\n\nactually saw the knives being drawnbeforethey carried out their part of the\n\nassault. More importantly, even if they had carried on hitting Sulaiman after their\n\nfriends had stabbed him, there is insufficient evidence to convince me beyond reasonable\n\ndoubt that the two accused had, there and then, formed a new common object ofcausing\n\nhurt with dangerous weaponsas charged.18.        The evaluation of the\n\nevidence must necessarily include a consideration of the written statements of Hasik (P98\n\nand D2), as well as his evidence in court and also the evidence of Chemong and Fahmi. I\n\nshould also mention that the convictions of these three in respect of their part in the\n\nassault on Sulaiman are independent matters left to the prosecutor's discretion and the\n\ndefence. They cannot safely be used to bolster the case for either prosecution or defence\n\nin the case before me. However, it was relevant for the court to know what charges had\n\nbeen proffered against them if they relate to the same incident, if only to be satisfied\n\nthat nothing materially relevant may be gleaned from those cases and nothing more. So far\n\nas Hasik's evidence in court is concerned, I am unable to place any weight on it as he was\n\na figure of dejection and had no interest whatsoever in giving any evidence in the spirit\n\nthat was required of a material witness. He was thus unable to provide any further\n\ninformation or explain any part of his written statements. So, having taken all the\n\nwritten statements into account, and apportioning the weight to them as I think\n\nappropriate, I come to the following conclusion.",
        "Conclusion": "19.        In cases such as this\n\nwhere a young and innocent life is senselessly slain, the retribution of the law must be\n\ninflicted swiftly and firmly but, appropriately, as against the diverse offenders and the\n\ndiverse nature of their crime. In this case, I am of the view that the defence had raised\n\na reasonable doubt as to whether the two accused are guilty of murder in having a common\n\nobject with others to cause hurt with dangerous weapons to Sulaiman Bin Hashim. However,\n\non the facts as I have found, both accused are guilty of an offence of Rioting under s 147\n\nof the Penal Code, Ch 224. I therefore find them guilty of that offence and convicted them\n\naccordingly.20.        I am of the view that it\n\nis inappropriate and wrong to amend the murder charge to one under s 299 Penal Code for\n\nculpable homicide not amounting to murder because the mental element that s 299 requires\n\nto be present had not been proved on the facts as I have found in this case. Why it was\n\nthat Hasik pleaded guilty to a s 299 is not a matter before me. However, it will be\n\nremembered that he was, together with the two accused before me, faced with a capital\n\ncharge. Whether he accepted the reduced charge as a life-line is a decision personal to\n\nhim, and if that proves to be an error of judgment on his part he has to seek correction\n\nelsewhere.21.        After hearing submissions\n\nin mitigation, and the reply by the DPP, I am of the view that there is insufficient\n\ndistinction between the two accused to be reflected in the sentences against them. The\n\noffence was sufficiently serious to merit a stiff punishment and I therefore sentenced\n\nthem to five years imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane each. The sentence of\n\nimprisonment shall commence from the date of their arrest.Sgd:Choo Han TeckJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
