        "The facts": "2 The respondents are both Indonesian nationals who were employed by\n\nthe child’s parents back in Indonesia to work in Singapore. Sakdiah, aged 24 years,\n\nwas engaged as the family’s maid, while Tiyatun, aged 42 years, was hired as the\n\nchild’s nanny.3 On 17 December 2001 at about 7.20pm, the respondents were feeding the\n\nchild in the toilet attached to his room. The child’s meal comprised of porridge\n\nblended with soft minced meat and vegetables. Tiyatun, the elder of the pair, directed\n\nSakdiah to press the child’s nostrils together while holding down his hands so as to\n\ntemporarily incapacitate his movements. The purpose of such an exercise was to force him\n\nto open his mouth, whereupon Tiyatun used a plastic cup to pour food into his mouth. In\n\nthe course of so doing, the child had difficulty breathing. He started gasping for air and\n\nhis face turned a bluish hue.4 Later that evening, his parents sent him to Kandang Kerbau\n\nWomen’s and Children’s Hospital (‘KKH’) for medical treatment where he\n\nwas warded in the intensive care unit.5 The child passed away three days later on 20 December 2001 at 5.52am.\n\nThe final cause of death was certified to be \"bronchopneumonia due to inhalation of\n\nforeign material\". The pathologist suggested that there were previous occasions in\n\nthe several weeks preceding the child’s death when he had inhaled foreign material. A\n\nmedical report submitted by KKH concluded that the fact that food debris had been found in\n\nthe upper airway and trachea of the child constituted evidence that suggested choking.6 Investigations revealed that the respondents had, without the\n\nknowledge of the child’s parents, been feeding him in the same way since he was 13\n\nmonths old.",
        "The appeal": "7 The public prosecutor appealed against the sentence imposed on the\n\nground that it was manifestly inadequate. It was submitted, inter alia, that the district\n\njudge had failed to accord sufficient weight to the aggravating factors in the case and\n\nhad erred in law and in fact in holding that the culpability of the respondents stemmed\n\nlargely from their ignorance when the \"crux of the offence lies in acting with the\n\nconsciousness that mischievous and illegal consequence may follow\". The prosecution\n\ntherefore pressed for a deterrent sentence.8 In the present case, there is no dispute that the acts of the\n\nrespondents in force feeding the child were rash. They had, in the court below, confirmed\n\nthat they were conscious that death was at least a possible consequence of their actions.\n\nYet, in spite of an awareness of the possibility of the inherent risk involved, they had\n\ncarried on with their method of force feeding him. It was their rashness, in running the\n\nrisk that the possibility of death may ensue, that made them criminally culpable under s\n\n304A. In this connection, I found the district judge’s finding that the\n\nrespondents’ culpability stemmed largely from their ignorance to be diametrically\n\nopposed to the essence of the respondents’ conviction for causing death by a rash\n\nact. Ignorance of a fact implies a lack of knowledge or awareness of it. On the present\n\nfacts, this was obviously not the case as the respondents had admitted to being conscious\n\nthat death was at least a possible consequence of their method of force feeding. By their\n\nown admission, they were clearly not ignorant of the consequence, as improbable as they\n\nmight have considered it to be, and had chosen to proceed regardless of their recognition\n\nof the risk of death.9 However, while I found that the district judge had erred in holding\n\nthat the culpability of the respondents stemmed largely from their ignorance, I was also\n\nof the opinion that the sentence of nine months’ imprisonment was appropriate in the\n\ncircumstances of the case. The severity of the sentence for a s 304A offence depends to a\n\ngreat extent on the degree of rashness or negligence which was present in the conduct of\n\nthe accused. The greater the degree of rashness or negligence exhibited by the accused in\n\nthe circumstances wherein death resulted, the more reprehensible his conduct and the more\n\nsevere his sentence should be. For the purposes of sentencing, the mere fact that a human\n\nlife is lost does not in itself justify the court in passing a deterrent sentence.10 An example of an extremely high degree of rashness was that\n\nexhibited by the accused in the unreported decision ofPP v Ikaeshi Dulkolid(DAC\n\n41395/2000) cited by the prosecution before me. In that case, the accused, a domestic\n\nmaid, had picked up the deceased and extended the 14-months old crying infant outside the\n\nwindow with the intent of letting the deceased see the birds outside. The accused, without\n\nresting her own arms on the window ledge for additional support, used her right palm to\n\nprop up the deceased’s buttocks and placed her left hand under the deceased’s\n\nleft arm-pit to steady the deceased. While holding the deceased in this manner, the\n\naccused became engrossed in her own thoughts. She lost her grip on the deceased who began\n\nmoving about thereby causing the deceased to fall to her death. The accused pleaded guilty\n\nto the charge of causing the deceased’s death by doing a rash act not amounting to\n\nculpable homicide pursuant to s 304A of the Penal Code and was sentenced to the maximum\n\nterm of imprisonment of two years.11 It is axiomatic that the rashness exhibited in the case ofIkaeshi\n\nDulkolidwas of the highest degree. Holding an infant outside a window, was an\n\nextremely foolish and dangerous thing to do. This was particularly so, given that the\n\naccused was preoccupied with her thoughts, while holding the infant so precariously. The\n\nprobability of the risk of death ensuing in such a situation was very high. The\n\ncircumstances of the case clearly pointed to the accused’s total disregard of the\n\ninfant’s safety. Her rashness was of the most extreme kind and she deserved the\n\nmaximum sentence of two years’ imprisonment for her blatant disregard for the life of\n\nanother human being entrusted in the care.12 By contrast, while the respondents in the present case were\n\ncriminally rash in that they appreciated the risk of death as a possible consequence of\n\ntheir method of feeding but chose to carry on regardless, the circumstances did not smack\n\nof their total disregard for the child’s life. The fact remained that the respondents\n\nwere feeding the child a meal of porridge blended with soft minced meat and vegetables, a\n\nmeal that could have been easily swallowed by the child. More importantly, they had been\n\nfeeding him in the same manner over the past eight months with no adverse consequences.\n\nGiven the circumstances of the case, the culpable rashness exhibited by the respondents\n\nwas of a lesser degree and deserving of a correspondingly lower sentence.13 Based on the foregoing, I saw no reason for enhancing the sentence which adequately\n\nreflected their criminality and was, in my opinion, sufficient to create awareness of the\n\nrisk inherent in force feeding as well as to deter individuals with a similar practice\n\nfrom so doing.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWCheif JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
