        "Analysis": "88. The plaintiffs have put their case as\n\nbeing one in which the defendant, as their agent or employee, having received monies on\n\ntheir behalf and for their use, has failed to pay the monies to them but has wrongfully\n\nretained the same for his own account. The defendant admits that all except one of the\n\ningredients necessary for this claim are present here. The disputed ingredient is whether\n\nthe monies received by the defendant were in fact meant for the plaintiffs.89. In order to find in the\n\nplaintiffs’ favour, I would have to be satisfied that each payment that was directed\n\nto the defendant or received by him was money to which the plaintiffs were entitled. The\n\nplaintiffs have put up a prima facie case in relation to most of their claims by showing\n\nthat the payments were remitted by HPD in response to invoices issued by the plaintiffs\n\nand apparently in settlement of commission due to the plaintiffs under those invoices.\n\nSince it is the defendant who says those invoices are shams, it is he who has the burden\n\nof proving that the remittances were not meant for the plaintiffs but were made for\n\nentirely different reasons. He has to show not only the general arrangement between\n\nhimself/the plaintiffs and HPD that existed for payment of money to IKPP employees but\n\nalso that each payment that the plaintiffs claim was a payment made pursuant to that\n\ngeneral arrangement and was not money payable to the plaintiffs.",
        "(i) What was agreed and by whom in\n\nrelation to the contacts?": "90. The first issue that I must deal with\n\nis whether there was any arrangement to facilitate HPD’s payments of bribes to IKPP\n\nemployees and, if so, the exact nature of that arrangement and the plaintiffs’\n\nknowledge of the same. The documentary evidence shows, contrary to Mr Margono’s\n\nassertions, that the plaintiffs did, at least occasionally, pay commissions to IKPP\n\nemployees in relation to contracts awarded to their principal Eimco. Although those\n\ncommissions were of small amounts of money, their payment and the entertainment expenses\n\nincurred indicate that it was necessary for foreign suppliers or their agents to sweeten\n\nup IKPP employees in order to get or retain contracts. It therefore appears probable that\n\nHPD would have taken a similar course in relation to the contracts it wanted from IKPP\n\ndespite IKPP’s own intimations that it would strongly object to any payments to its\n\nstaff.91. The defendant’s evidence was that\n\nit was HPD’s idea to set up the arrangement whereby the plaintiffs would send HPD\n\ninvoices for commission to enable HPD to pay out the funds for the contacts. Mr Digon,\n\nhowever, was evasive when he was asked who had drawn up the plan to put up invoices for\n\npayment to the defendant’s account in Singapore. It took a considerable amount of\n\npressing before he admitted that he had instructed the defendant to send out the invoices.\n\nEven then he did not admit that he had suggested that payment be made to the\n\ndefendant’s own account. He did not even want to admit outright that that was where\n\nthe funds had gone and said to HPD the plaintiffs and the defendant were the same thing,\n\nso HPD had paid to the defendant under the letterhead of the plaintiffs and there was\n\nnothing wrong with this action.92. As I have noted above, Mr Digon gave\n\nconflicting evidence from time to time about the distinction between the plaintiffs and\n\nthe defendant. He did not want to admit knowing that the defendant was only an employee of\n\nthe plaintiffs. He kept referring to the two as being the same. He was obviously keen to\n\nblur the lines between them so as to justify HPD’s conduct in making payment to an\n\nindividual when it had been invoiced by a company.93. Having considered the evidence\n\noverall, I accept that Mr Digon and perhaps others in HPD were willing to make payments to\n\ncontacts in Indonesia in order to get business from IKPP. I accept that Mr Digon and the\n\ndefendant set up the arrangement described so as to enable such payments which Mr Digon\n\nhimself variously described as both ‘legitimate’ and ‘clandestine’ to\n\nbe made under a veneer of respectability. I do not know the extent to which this practice\n\nwas condoned by the directors of HPD. The fact that HPD needed commission invoices from\n\nthe plaintiffs, their official agent, for the purposes of their accounting records and\n\npayments, is some indication that, despite what Mr Digon proclaimed, the practice was not\n\nwidely known in HPD and may not have been known to anyone else on the board.94. The defendant produced two letters\n\nostensibly written by Mr Manuel Fernandez, the managing director of HPD, which would show\n\nthat he was aware of the practice. Mr Fernandez did not testify, however, and there was no\n\nindependent evidence to indicate that either he or the board as a whole was aware that the\n\npayments were being made to the defendant’s personal account. The two letters that\n\nwere signed by Mr Fernandez were, significantly, sent to the plaintiffs though put to the\n\nattention of the defendant.95. It is also interesting that in\n\nHPD’s instruction to its bank given on 1 December 1993 for the payment for the sum of\n\nUS$30,000, claimed by the plaintiffs under invoice DSS/HPD/001/93, the name of the\n\nbeneficiary was given as ‘P.T. Dwiputra Sumber Sukses/Ho Ming Siang’. The\n\nplaintiffs were named as the sole beneficiary in a payment instruction given by HPD on 30\n\nDecember 1993 in respect of the sum of US$1,163.70. This happened again in HPD’s\n\npayment instruction dated 12 July 1994 for US$7,295 and its instruction dated 20 September\n\n1994 for US$38,000. In all four cases, the payment instruction went on to name the\n\ndefendant’s bank account and the defendant’s bank as the recipient of the\n\npayment and to give the name of the defendant as the account holder.96. Having reviewed the evidence\n\ncarefully, I am satisfied that Mr Margono was not aware of the procedure set up by Mr\n\nDigon and the defendant. If he had been aware of HPD’s intention to pay substantial\n\nbribes to IKPP employees, the procedure would have been established in a different way.\n\nDuring cross-examination, various alternatives were put to the defendant. He agreed that\n\nthese alternatives would have been practically possible. If they had been adopted (for\n\nexample the suggestion of an account in Singapore in the joint names of himself and Mr\n\nMargono) there would have been no doubt as to the plaintiffs’ knowledge of what was\n\nhappening. It would have been entirely reasonable to involve Mr Margono in the procedure\n\nsince if IKPP had found out what was happening, it was likely to hold the plaintiffs\n\nresponsible and to blacklist them. The defendant could not give any good reason for not\n\nhaving Mr Margono as involved as he himself was. All he could say, rather feebly, was that\n\nthe procedure adopted was that which had been agreed between himself and Mr Digon.97. The procedure as adopted gave both Mr\n\nDigon and the defendant full licence to dispense the bribe monies as they saw fit and\n\neven, if they wanted to, to keep some for themselves. There was no way of holding the\n\ndefendant to account. The contacts would not give receipts. Although Mr Digon asserted\n\nthat if the defendant had not paid the contacts he would have known about it, since he did\n\nnot even know who all the contacts were, he was not likely to hear a full list of\n\ncomplaints. Further, he would not know whether the amount that the defendant told him the\n\ncontacts wanted was what they had actually asked for or if they were willing to accept\n\nless. Mr Digon did not deal with the defendant’s contacts. He left it to the\n\ndefendant to pay them directly while he apparently paid his own contacts.(ii) Credibility of the witnesses98. On the whole, I found Mr Margono to be\n\na credible witness. He was untruthful in relation to the commission paid to some IKPP\n\nemployees as revealed in the defendant’s expense list. He must have known that those\n\ncommissions were bribes. Most of the rest of his evidence was, however, straightforward\n\nand was not successfully challenged in cross-examination.99. I was not impressed with the defendant\n\nand Mr Digon. Both were evasive. Mr Digon was not willing to assist the court by giving it\n\nfull information. His memory proved to be poor. He needed to be prodded before he would\n\nmake admissions and he was often inconsistent and illogical. The defendant was no better.\n\nA flavour of his evidence can be obtained from the account of it that I have given above.\n\nHe was given to wide-ranging and exaggerated statements and was not even truthful about\n\nmundane details like his salary and the period of his employment.(iii) Was the agency agreement terminated?100. The defendant alleged that the\n\nplaintiffs were not entitled to any commission in respect of the IKP/HPD/51 contract\n\nbecause the agency agreement had been terminated in April 1994. The defendant therefore\n\nhad the burden of proving this. In my judgment, he has not discharged that burden.101. There was no evidence that the letter\n\nof 23 April was actually sent out to HPD in April 1994. The defendant did not claim the\n\npostage expenses that would have incurred if the letter had been posted. The\n\nplaintiffs’ fax records show no fax transmission to HPD on 23 April. More telling\n\nthan this negative evidence is, however, the positive evidence of the conduct of HPD and\n\nthe plaintiffs after April 1994. HPD continued to hold the plaintiffs out as their agents\n\nuntil mid 1995 and the plaintiffs did do work on HPD’s behalf until that time. At no\n\ntime after October 1994 when they were informed by the plaintiffs that the defendant had\n\nbeen sacked and that the plaintiffs wanted a full accounting of all commissions paid and\n\npayable, did HPD assert that the plaintiffs were no longer their agents because of the\n\ntermination letter. Mr Fernandez and Mr Digon met Mr Margono personally in Jakarta in\n\nearly 1995 and even though the issue of commissions was brought up there was not a word on\n\nthe termination of the agency agreement.102. The termination letter was not a\n\nlogical document. There was no reason for the plaintiffs to terminate the whole of the\n\nagency arrangement simply because the bribes asked for by the contacts were driving up\n\nHPD’s costs. The agency agreement had made provision for such a situation by cl 4 and\n\nthe parties could have negotiated either for a reduction in the plaintiffs’\n\ncommission or for it to be waived altogether. The defendant was not able to give a good\n\nreason as to why the plaintiffs’ interests required the termination of the agency\n\nagreement. Neither was it in HPD’s interest to terminate the agency agreement. Once\n\nthe agreement was terminated, the whole procedure for payment of bribes would have fallen\n\napart. That procedure was still necessary as shown by the defendant’s letter of 5\n\nAugust 1994 thanking HPD for awarding the plaintiffs commission for the IKP/HPD/51\n\ncontract. That letter only made sense in the context of an existing agency relationship\n\nwith the plaintiffs. If the agency had ended, HPD’s accounting department could never\n\nhave approved the payment of the commission and the IKP/HPD/51 contacts could not have\n\nreceived their bribes.103. I am satisfied that the termination\n\nletter was not written in April 1994 but much later in order to boost the defendant’s\n\ndefence to this claim. It was concocted by the defendant with the assistance of Mr Digon\n\nwho put his signature on the letter and wrote the date ‘April 28, 1994’ in an\n\nattempt to show that he had received the letter and accepted the termination on that date.\n\nMr Digon also concocted the reply of 28 April 1994 which referred to ‘your fax of\n\npast 23 April’. As noted, he was not able to explain what fax he had been referring\n\nto in the first line of that letter since the plaintiffs had not sent any fax to HPD on\n\nthat date. Mr Digon had to resort to asserting that probably he was referring to a fax of\n\n22 April which he had only seen on 23 April. That fax was not, however, produced.\n\nHPD’s letter of 28 April 1994 was so specifically tailored to the matters raised in\n\nthe termination letter that really it could not have been connected with any fax sent on\n\n22 April.(iv) The specific claims: (a) the\n\ncommission payable under contract IKP/HPD/51104. The plaintiffs’ claim is that\n\nthey are entitled to US$380,000 as commission for this contract whereby IKPP agreed to\n\npurchase an evaporator plant from HPD at a price of US$10,117,000. They rely on the letter\n\nof 5 August 1994 which the defendant sent under their letterhead to HPD congratulating HPD\n\non obtaining contract IKP/HPD/51 due to the combined hard work of the plaintiffs and HPD.\n\nThe letter went on to thank HPD for the commission awarded to it amounting to US$380,000\n\nand indicated that this amount should be paid against invoices to be issued by\n\nChemkonsult.105. The plaintiffs also point to a letter\n\ndated 27 July 1994 from HPD agreeing to pay US$380,000 as commission for the contract and\n\nstating that payment would be made by them in line with the payment terms they had with\n\nIKPP ie 10% with the contract and 90% with the partial shipments. The plaintiffs submitted\n\nthat this was proof that the commission was due to them since the payment terms in the\n\ncontract itself provided for 10% of the purchase price to be paid immediately against an\n\ninvoice issued by HPD and the balance to be paid by way of an irrevocable letter of credit\n\nwhich could be drawn on pro-rata as each shipment of equipment was made.106. The defendant had three main grounds\n\non he disputed this claim. First, that since the agency agreement had been terminated, no\n\ncommission accrued on contract IKP/HPD/51. Second, as shown by the hand-written notation\n\non the letter of 27 July, the US$380,000 was meant for the contacts. Third, that the\n\nplaintiffs were aware that they were not making a genuine claim as they had taken three\n\nyears to quantify it and even after quantification, the amount had varied between\n\nUS$160,000 and US$380,000.107. In view of my finding on the\n\ntermination of the agency agreement, the first objection has no basis. Both defence\n\nwitnesses conceded that work had been done by the plaintiffs in respect of the IKP/HPD/51\n\ncontract. Prima facie, they were entitled to commission on that contract in accordance\n\nwith the terms of the agency agreement. The defendant knew this. HPD knew this too and Mr\n\nDigon had no difficulty in coming up with the amount of commission payable when pressed on\n\nthis issue during his meeting with Mr Margono. He told Mr Margono that the amount due was\n\nUS$160,000. At that stage, he made no mention of the fact that the agreement had been\n\nterminated or that there had been any agreement for the plaintiffs to forego commission\n\nbecause of the high costs of paying the contacts. Though Mr Digon maintained that he could\n\nnot remember telling Mr Margono this, he did not deny that Mr Margono had asked him about\n\nthe commission. I accept Mr Margono’s evidence that he was given the figure by Mr\n\nDigon personally. This was corroborated by the appearance of that figure in the\n\nplaintiffs’ first letter of demand for the commission and also by Mr Digon’s\n\noral testimony when he confirmed that if the schedule of rates annexed to the agency\n\nagreement had been applied to contract IKP/HPD/51, the plaintiffs’ commission would\n\nhave been US$150,000 to US$160,000.108. The second objection is that the\n\nmoney was due to the contacts. There is no evidence that the whole of the sum of\n\nUS$380,000, was agreed to be paid or paid to the contacts. There is no evidence of payment\n\nof even the reduced amount of US$330,000. Significantly, this figure was mentioned for the\n\nfirst time in court and did not appear in the defence or either of the affidavits filed on\n\nbehalf of the defence. In the original version of his affidavit, Mr Digon said that the\n\nsum of US$380,000 ‘was paid’ to the plaintiffs and defendant’s contacts. In\n\ncourt, he changed the words ‘was paid’ to ‘was to be paid’ and then\n\ncame out with the story that actually only US$330,000 had been paid. He was unable,\n\nhowever, to give any details of the payments or produce any documents to show that apart\n\nfrom the sum of US$38,000 which had been sent to the defendant initially, the remaining\n\nUS$292,000 had been taken out of HPD and given to the defendant and/or the contacts. He\n\nclaimed to be unable to even remember how much he had given the defendant and how much he\n\nhad given his own contacts. To cover up the lack of documentation, he told a story of\n\nhaving brought the money to Singapore in a suit case and then having distributed it\n\namongst the defendant and his own contacts.109. I found Mr Digon’s story\n\nincredible. The lack of particularisation was telling. Further, the defendant was not able\n\nto give any credible reason why the money had to be brought to Singapore in cash when\n\nthere was already a system set up to remit money to his account. All he said was that the\n\ncontacts required cash but he then had to concede that they could still have received cash\n\nif the money had been sent to a bank account. He was also unable to produce the invoice\n\nwhich Chemkonsult had, it was alleged, sent to HPD to enable HPD to process the payment to\n\nthe contacts. The defendant had a lame story of having destroyed all Chemkonsult’s\n\ndocuments. He did not make a true effort to get the document from HPD. All he did was to\n\nask Mr Digon for it when he knew that Mr Digon was in Indonesia not Spain where the\n\nrecords were. Mr Digon’s response was significant: basically he could not be bothered\n\nto even ask his administration department whether they could locate the document. There\n\nmust have been some reason why no one was willing to produce this invoice. Perhaps no\n\ninvoice was sent. Perhaps the invoice was for the full US$380,000 or perhaps it was for\n\nUS$342,000 (ie US$380,000 less US$30,000) and not for the reduced amount of US$292,000.110. Even assuming that the defendant and\n\nMr Digon did pay some money to their contacts, I am not satisfied that these payments\n\nwould have come close to US$380,000, or even the reduced sum of US$330,000. The defendant\n\nwas unable to produce documentation to show withdrawals from his accounts which would\n\nsupport even the initial payment of US$38,000 which he claimed to have given to Mr\n\nSheshadri. All he could point to were the two withdrawals totalling US$19,695.111. I do not accept that US$380,000 was\n\ndue to the contacts. The defendant has failed to discharge his onus of proof in that\n\nregard. That does not, however, mean that the plaintiffs are entitled to that sum as\n\ncommission. The evidence showed that their commission would have been around US$160,000\n\ndepending on the exchange rate of the Spanish peseta to the United States dollar (one\n\ncalculation done by Mr Digon and given to me showed the amount payable as US$162,942). The\n\nplaintiffs initially accepted this figure of US$160,000 as given to them by Mr Digon. It\n\nmust have accorded with their own calculations (even though at one stage Mr Margono said\n\nthat he was unable to compute the commission). The plaintiffs were somewhat opportunistic\n\nin revising their claim to US$380,000 on the basis of their subsequent discovery of the\n\ndefendant’s letter to HPD but this does not mean that they are debarred from claiming\n\nwhat is indeed due to them.112. I note here that Mr Digon confirmed\n\nthat all payments due to HPD under the IKP/HPD/51 contract had been made and that the\n\ndefendant had been given all the money due to the contacts. Whilst I cannot work out\n\nexactly what the defendant received (either directly or through Chemkonsult) since his\n\nevidence and that of Mr Digon on this point was not full or properly documented, I am\n\nsatisfied that it is safe to infer that he received at least the US$160,000 which would\n\nhave been payable to the plaintiffs as their commission on this contract. I therefore hold\n\nthat he should repay this sum to the plaintiffs as money had and received for their use.113. I must also deal here with the\n\nplaintiffs’ invoice DSS/HPD/IKPP/94/003 dated 4 August 1994 for US$38,000. The\n\ndefendant submitted that this was an invoice for part of the commission due in relation to\n\ncontract IKP/HPD/51 as clearly reflected in the invoice itself. Thus, the plaintiffs were\n\nmaking a double claim by asking both for the US$380,000 specified in the letter of 5\n\nAugust 1994 and this sum of US$38,000 under the invoice of 4 August. I accept the\n\ndefendant’s submission on this point.114. The plaintiffs have not been able to\n\npoint to any other contract under which they would have been entitled to commission of\n\nUS$38,000. Their sole reason for submitting that this sum was not related to the\n\nUS$380,000 is that by the letter of 5 August HPD was directed to pay US$380,000 against\n\ninvoices issued by Chemkonsult even though the invoice for US$38,000 had already gone out.\n\nThey say that if the two had been related, HPD would have been directed to pay only\n\nUS$342,000 to Chemkonsult. Whilst there is an inconsistency between the two documents,\n\nthis alone cannot establish an entirely separate contract between HPD and IKPP for which\n\nthe plaintiffs would be entitled to be paid commission. I am therefore unable to make any\n\nseparate award to the plaintiffs in respect of the invoice of 4 August 1994.(b) The commission payable under Invoice\n\nDSS/HPD/001/93115. This invoice is dated 24 November\n\n1993. It is for an amount of US$30,000 described as ‘Being for the supply of detained\n\npiping engineering for Two (2) NCG systems in Perawang and Jambi, Indonesia’. The\n\ninvoice refers to two orders namely orders no. IK/HPD/NCG/864 and WK/HPD/NCG/W64 and is\n\napparently in respect of two contracts procured by the plaintiffs on HPD’s behalf.\n\nThere is supporting evidence in the form of a fax dated 3 September 1993 from the\n\nplaintiffs to IKPP arranging for a meeting between the defendant and Mr Digon on the one\n\nhand and employees of IKPP in Perawang on the other to clarify and finalise what is\n\ndescribed as the ‘NCG proposal’.116. The defendant submitted that this sum\n\nwas not commission due to the plaintiffs. He relied on a fax dated 24 September 1993 to\n\nthe plaintiffs from HPD on the subject of ‘NCG Order’. It stated ‘With the\n\nofficial acceptance of this order, please proceed immediately to transfer the said amount\n\nof US$30,000 to our common friends in Indonesia, as already commented’. This was one\n\nof the letters from HPD which were produced by the defendant and which the plaintiffs said\n\nthey knew nothing about.117. The defendant further submitted that\n\nthe commission due to the plaintiffs in respect of the NCG contracts was paid to the\n\nplaintiffs pursuant to their invoice AH/HD/035. This invoice was dated 11 April 1994.\n\nThree items appear on it. The first is described as ‘Agent Commission for Pulp 8 NCG\n\nSystem PT. IKPP Perawang contract no. IK/NCG/HPD 864’ and is quantified at US$15,319.\n\nThe second is described as ‘Agent Commission for J-Pulp NCG System PT. WKS Jambi\n\ncontract no. WKS/NCG/HPD/W64’ and is quantified at US$15,319. The invoice\n\nspecifically directed HPD to pay the amounts invoiced to the plaintiffs’ account with\n\nBank Buana Indonesia. The plaintiffs do not deny that this invoice has been settled in\n\nfull. It would be noted that the contract numbers on this invoice are identical to the\n\ncontract numbers quoted on invoice DSS/HPD/001/93.118. The defendant gave evidence that HPD\n\nhad remitted the sum of US$30,000 in respect of this contract to his account with Citibank\n\nN.A. He said that he had then withdrawn the money and paid it over to a Mr Benda of IKPP.\n\nWhilst no bank statement was produced to substantiate this payment and it is possible that\n\nthe defendant might not have paid over all the money to Mr Benda, it appears to me that\n\nthis payment was not intended for the plaintiffs but for the contacts. The plaintiffs did\n\nreceive commission on the two NCG contracts and they cannot be entitled to two sets of\n\ncommission on the same contracts. Accordingly, in relation to this sum the defendant has\n\ndischarged the burden of establishing that the money was not the plaintiffs’.(c) The Christmas gifts invoice119. This invoice, AH/HD/023 dated 28\n\nDecember 1993, is for the sum of US$1,163.70 being the amount due in respect of ‘one\n\nlot Christmas presents for key personnels(sic)of PT Indah Kiat Pulp and Paper\n\nCorp. Indonesia’. The defendant said that he used the money to pay for customary\n\nChristmas gifts such as hampers and other small items for employees of IKPP.120. The plaintiffs pointed out that the\n\ndefendant was unable to name the persons to whom the gifts were given nor give exact\n\ndescriptions of the gifts. In the plaintiffs’ submissions, they also said that\n\namounts claimed from them by the defendant as reimbursement for gifts given to IKPP\n\nemployees in September 1993 were almost as much as the amount claimed from HPD for the\n\nChristmas gifts and therefore that he must have been making a double claim.121. I do not accept that argument. The\n\namounts were not identical and the dates were different. The defendant’s expense\n\naccounts submitted to the plaintiffs showed that he bought gifts on their account in\n\nSeptember and October. He also incurred entertainment expenses in relation to IKPP\n\npersonnel. The defendant’s expense accounts show that it was routine for him to\n\nexpend money on keeping the plaintiffs’ customers’ employees happy. In that\n\nsituation there is no reason to conclude that the September gifts must have been the\n\nChristmas gifts and that he could not have given two different sets of gifts altogether.\n\nThe plaintiffs have not established that the money received by the defendant under this\n\ninvoice was received by him for their account.(d) The sum of US$7,295 under invoice\n\nAH/HD/043122. This invoice was dated 16 June 1994.\n\nIt comprised two items. The first, in the amount of US$3,559 was described as\n\n‘Commission for Piping Take-off PTIKPP Pulp 8 NCG System’ and the second, in the\n\namount of US$3,736, was described as ‘Commission for Piping Take-off PTWKS J-Pulp NCG\n\nSystem’. The defendant said that this was to cover further payments to the contacts\n\ndue in relation to the contracts mentioned in invoice DSS/HPD/001/93 and that the\n\nplaintiffs had already received their commission via the invoice AH/HD/035 mentioned in\n\npara 117. However, the withdrawals from his bank account which the defendant identified as\n\nbeing the payments to Mr Sheshadri for this invoice fell nearly US$2,000 short of the\n\nfunds he had received and there were other improbabilities in his account of how that\n\npayment was made.123. Under cross-examination, however, Mr\n\nDigon conceded that invoice AH/HD/043 could possibly relate to two orders that were\n\nadditional to those covered by AH/HD/035. He also conceded that further commissions could\n\nhave been payable by virtue of additional orders for piping sets mentioned in\n\ncorrespondence in March 1994. These orders were for goods worth US$80,000 and US$84,000\n\nrespectively. Using the commission table in the agency agreement, the plaintiffs\n\ncalculated the commission payable for those orders as coming up to approximately US$3,914\n\nand US$4,074 based on an exchange rate of US$1 = 140 pesetas. They submitted that the\n\ndifference between their figures and those in the invoice AH/HD/043 could be due to\n\nfluctuation in exchange rates.124. In my judgment, the plaintiffs are\n\nentitled to this sum of US$7,295. The defendant sent out invoice AH/HD/043 for commission\n\non the plaintiffs’ letterhead and he was unable to explain why this document was not\n\nan authentic invoice. HPD had already paid its contacts US$30,000 pursuant to\n\nDSS/HPD/001/93 for the contracts mentioned in AH/HD/035 and it was up to the defendant to\n\nshow that those contracts were the same as those invoice under AH/HD/043. He did not do\n\nso. The evidence given by Mr Digon was contrary to the defendant’s stand. Further, he\n\ngave no reason why HPD would be paying the contacts an extra US$7,295 for the same\n\ncontracts when it was clearly unhappy about hard bargaining to reduce what it thought had\n\nbeen previously agreed prices. Finally, it appears from the correspondence that invoice\n\nAH/HD/035 related to plant supplied to the customers whereas invoice AH/HD/043 related to\n\npiping.(e) Chemkonsult invoice no.\n\nCKS/HPD/IK-VE/94-001125. This invoice appears on the\n\nletterhead of Chemkonsult and is dated 21 November 1994, that is a few days before\n\nChemkonsult commenced its legal existence. The reference is ‘No. 1027 NCG for\n\nJambi’ and the description of the work done is ‘Assorted Pipings material\n\naccording to HPD Supervisor for PT. WKS Jambi’. The amount due is US$34,143.126. In the defendant’s submission,\n\nhe noted that the plaintiffs had notified HPD on 25 October 1994 that he had left the\n\nplaintiffs. He asserted that notwithstanding that letter, HPD had continued to deal with\n\nhim personally for payment to their contacts and as such the invoice issued by Chemkonsult\n\ndid not concern the plaintiffs. Further, the invoice did not state that it was commission\n\nfor work done. The defendant submitted that the plaintiffs had not proved that they were\n\nentitled to receive this sum in the first place. The plaintiffs did not know how the sum\n\nwas arrived at and it was submitted that the money was more likely to have been for the\n\ncontacts than for the plaintiffs.127. The plaintiffs conceded that they\n\nwere unaware how the amount had been calculated. They pointed out that reference was made,\n\nhowever, to the NCG project in Jambi in respect of which the plaintiffs had been\n\nHPD’s agents and for which commission was payable. In cross-examination, the\n\ndefendant had conceded that the work in Jambi had been done when he was employed by the\n\nplaintiffs. He had further conceded that Chemkonsult was not involved in this project at\n\nall nor was there any contract or agreement between Chemkonsult and HPD under which these\n\nmonies became due. The defendant’s stand appeared to be that the money belonged to\n\nChemkonsult, and that he was not obliged to say what had happened to the funds. The\n\nplaintiffs submitted that the Chemkonsult invoice had been drawn up only for the purpose\n\nof diverting sums due to the plaintiffs to itself in a seemingly ‘legitimate’\n\nmanner. Although the invoice instructed that payment be made to Chemkonsult, the account\n\nnumber that was given was the defendant’s personal account and this made it clear\n\nthat the end recipient was always the defendant.128. The defendant has not explained to my\n\nsatisfaction why the Chemkonsult invoice was not the plaintiffs’ concern. He took a\n\nrather arrogant stand in relation to it. Although he repeated his usual refrain about the\n\nmoney being meant for contacts, he gave no details of these contacts or when payment was\n\nmade to them. The agency agreement between the plaintiffs and HPD was ongoing at the time\n\nthe Chemkonsult invoice was issued. The defendant had no business issuing invoices to HPD\n\nafter he left the plaintiffs’ employ for projects in which he had been involved\n\nduring his employment with the plaintiffs. He must account to the plaintiffs for the money\n\nreceived on this invoice.Conclusion129. I have found the defendant liable to\n\naccount for the sums of US$160,000, US$7,295 and US$34,143. There will be judgment for the\n\nplaintiffs in the total sum of US$201,438, interest thereon at 6% p.a. from 28 September\n\n1998 being the date of the plaintiffs’ solicitors letter setting out the\n\nplaintiffs’ full claim against the defendant and costs.Judith PrakashJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
