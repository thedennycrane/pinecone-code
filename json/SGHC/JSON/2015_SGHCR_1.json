        "Background facts leading to the arrest of The “Vinalines\n                Pioneer”": "3       The tragic incident at the heart of this\n                    application was the sinking of the vessel “Phu Tan” in the Tonkin\n                    Gulf on or around 16 December 2010 which lead to the loss of lives and property\n                    on board the “Phu Tan”. The relevant events leading up to the\n                    arrest which is the subject matter of this application are set out\n                below. 4       The Plaintiff is Hung Dao Container Joint Stock\n                    Company (“HD”), a Vietnamese incorporated company who had supplied\n                    the containers which were used on the “Phu Tan”. The Defendant is\n                    Vietnam National Shipping Lines, (“Vinalines”), the owner of\n                    “Phu Tan” and ‘The “Vinalines\n                        Pioneer”’. They are a state owned company\n                    incorporated in Vietnam, and are said to be in the commercial business of\n                    shipping, port operations andinter alia, the\n                    provision of coastal and ocean-going freight transportation\n                services. 5       The Defendant has a branch office known as\n                    Vinalines Container Shipping Company (“VCSC”). The\n                    Plaintiff’s case is that in or around June 2010 the Plaintiff and the\n                    Defendant (through their branch office VCSC) entered into a Container Lease\n                    Agreement no. 500710T/2010/HD-VCSC (the “2010 CLC”). It was\n                    conceded by the Defendant for the purposes of the present application, that\n                    Vinalines was the party to the 2010 CLC. 6       According to the Plaintiff, under the 2010 CLC,\n                    the Plaintiff agreed,inter alia, to lease\n                    containers to the Defendant for shipping their goods. I would note here that in\n                    the course of the hearings, there arose a dispute as to whether the 111\n                    containers were in fact leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC. The parties also\n                    crossed swords on what was the correct translation of Article 1.1 of the 2010\n                    CLC. These issues are addressed at [53] to [61] below. 7       Sometime in and around December 2010, the 111\n                    containers which were on lease to the Defendant were loaded on the\n                    Defendant’s vessel “Phu Tan” for carriage from Ho Chi\n                    Minh/Danang to Hai Phong. On 16 December 2010, the Defendant’s vessel\n                    “Phu Tan” capsized and sank. The sinking of the “Phu\n                    Tan” resulted in the loss of lives as well as all containers on board,\n                    including the 111 containers which are the subject of contention in the present\n                    proceedings. 8       The Plaintiff was informed by the Defendants by\n                    way of a letter dated 10 March 2011 that the “Phu Tan” had sank\n                    with all containers on board and that the 111 containers were a total loss. The\n                    Plaintiff alleged that following the incident, they made numerous attempts to\n                    recover compensation for the loss of the containers but were unsuccessful. The\n                    Plaintiff filed proceedings in Vietnam on 7 August 2012 but allege that there\n                    has been little progress in the Vietnamese proceedings save that the Defendant\n                    had on 16 May 2013 belatedly filed a “purported Explanation” which\n                    I surmise is a court document to be filed in the normal course of court\n                    proceedings in Vietnam. 9       The Plaintiff subsequently filed proceedings in\n                    Singapore on 4 June 2013. On 7 June 2013, the Plaintiff applied for and obtained\n                    the warrant of arrest (at the “Arrest Hearing”) and they arrested\n                    the vesselThe “Vinalines Pioneer”(“the Arrested Vessel”) on 9 June 2013. The Arrested Vessel was\n                    released on 11 June 2013 upon security being furnished. Subsequently, the\n                    Defendant entered appearance on 20 June 2013. The Plaintiff filed their\n                    Statement of Claim (“SOC”) on 12 June 2013 and the amended SOC was\n                    served on the Defendant on 25 July 2013. The Defendant then brought the present\n                    application.",
        "Procedural history of the application": "10     The present application was initially heard on\n                    27 September 2013 and then 31 October 2013. A further set of dates were taken in\n                    January 2014 in order to complete the hearing. Thereafter, the following series\n                    of procedural skirmishes, briefly set out below, ensued. 11     Prior to the adjourned hearing in January\n                    2014, the Defendants filed a further affidavit by Tran Phuong Thuy dated 2\n                    January 2014 and essentially sought to adduce further evidence which they\n                    alleged was relevant to their case on whether admiralty jurisdiction was\n                    properly invoked under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A and whether there was\n                    material non-disclosure by the Plaintiff. Given the seriousness of the\n                    allegations and the potential significance of the further evidence to the\n                    determination of the issues, I granted leave for the further affidavit to be\n                    admitted and allowed parties the opportunity to file further affidavits to\n                    address the further points of contention raised. In the course of events,\n                    parties subsequently filed further affidavits and provided discovery of further\n                    documents. The further evidence essentially comprised documents known as the\n                    Equipment Interchange Receipts (“EIRs”) and booking orders which\n                    were essentially documents exchanged between the parties to evidence the supply\n                    of a container from the Plaintiff to the Defendant. 12     The hearing resumed in end April 2014 and at\n                    the end of the hearing, parties were given leave to file written supplemental\n                    submissions to address some points which had not been fully addressed during the\n                    course of the hearing. However, the Plaintiff subsequently filed an application\n                    for leave to admit a further affidavit from their Vietnamese law expert, Luu\n                    Tien Dzung to address the issue of whether the Plaintiff’s claim was\n                    time-barred. I allowed the admission of the Plaintiff’s further affidavit,\n                    in the interests of the overall justice of the matter, given that it had\n                    potential significance to the time-bar issue which was being relied upon by the\n                    Defendant both as a ground for striking out and as a basis for setting aside the\n                    arrest for material non-disclosure. The Defendant was also given the opportunity\n                    to file reply affidavits on this issue. Another minor skirmish arose when the\n                    Defendant subsequently applied to strike out the further affidavit filed by the\n                    Plaintiffs’ Vietnamese law expert and this was resolved in favour of the\n                    Plaintiff. The parties eventually returned before me in end August 2014 and made\n                    their final arguments in the application. 13     At this juncture, it would be useful to\n                    broadly outline the parties’ respective arguments.",
        "The Parties’ Arguments": "14     The Defendant’s grounds for the setting\n                    aside were two-fold. First, they contended that the admiralty writ should be set\n                    aside as the Plaintiff’s claim did not fall within the jurisdictional\n                    limbs which the Plaintiff sought to rely on under section 3(1) of the HC(AJ)A.\n                    Separately, and as an independent ground for setting aside the arrest, they\n                    alleged that there was material non-disclosure in the Arrest Hearing and in the\n                    Plaintiff’s arrest affidavit filed by Tran Van Hung on 7 June 2013\n                    (“Arrest Affidavit”). 15     The Defendant’s case on striking out was\n                    premised on O18 r 19(1)(b) of the ROC and the inherent jurisdiction of the\n                    court, and based on the grounds that first the Plaintiff’s claim was\n                    time-barred and second that so far as the non-contractual claims were concerned,\n                    there was “not a shred of evidence” to support these claims, and\n                    that there is no evidence of “double actionability”. 16     The Defendant further asserted that this was a\n                    case where damages for wrongful arrest should be awarded as the claim was\n                    entirely without substance or foundation and that there was material\n                    non-disclosure by the Plaintiff in the Arrest Hearing as well as in the Arrest\n                    Affidavit filed by Tran Van Hung dated 7 June 2013. 17     In response, the Plaintiff contended that\n                    their present claim did fall within section 3(1), in particular sections\n                    3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the HC(AJ)A such that Admiralty jurisdiction was\n                    properly invoked. The Plaintiff argued that the nature of their claim was fully\n                    set out in the Arrest Affidavit as well as in the Indorsement of Claim. In\n                    particular, the Plaintiff asserted that they had provided sufficient information\n                    on,inter alia, the following: (a)     The details of the 2010 CLC between\n                        the parties and the material terms therein; (b)     the subject matter of the claim i.e. the loss of\n                        the 111 containers, (c)     The Plaintiff’s locus to sue, i.e. as the owners and/or lessors\n                        and/or bailors and/or persons entitled to immediate possession or having a\n                        reversionary interests in respect of the 111 containers; (d)     The basis upon which the claim was\n                        brought against the Defendant i.e. as the bailees and/or carriers of the\n                        containers; (e)     That the 111 containers were carried on board the Defendant’s vessel\n                        “Phu Tan” in or around December 2010 from Ho Chih Minh City\n                        and/or Danang to Hai Phong; (f)     That the 111 containers were for the vessel’s\n                        operation or maintenance or were equipment of the “Phu\n                        Tan”; (g)     That the 111 containers were lost when the Defendant’s vessel\n                        ”Phu Tan” sank on 16 December 2010. 18     As to the striking out, the Plaintiff asserted\n                    that there were merits to their present claim and it was a legally and factually\n                    sustainable claim. 19     Finally, the Plaintiff asserted that there was\n                    no material non-disclosure on their part and that in any event there was nomala fidesorcrassia\n                        negligentiawhich would justify an award of damages for wrongful\n                    arrest being made against them.",
        "The Issues before this Court": "20     Distilled to its core, the issues before this\n                    court can be set out as follows: (a)     The invocation of the admiralty in\n                        rem jurisdiction of the court: whether the Plaintiff’s claim falls\n                        within section 3(1)(d), (g) and/or (l) of the HC(AJ)A such that admiralty\n                        jurisdiction was properly invoked; (b)     The sustainability of the Plaintiff’s claims:\n                        whether the Plaintiff’s claim should be struck out under O 18 r 19 of\n                        the ROC and/or the inherent jurisdiction of the court; (c)     The material non-disclosure: whether\n                        there was material non-disclosure such that the Court should exercise its\n                        discretion to set aside the arrest; and (d)     In the event that the arrest was set aside or\n                        the claim struck out, whether the Plaintiff was liable to pay damages for\n                        the wrongful arrest 21     I address these issues in turn.",

        "The Law": "94     It was not in dispute that material\n                    non-disclosure is an independent ground for setting aside a warrant of arrest.\n                    The duty to make full and frank disclosure to the court was an important bulwark\n                    against the abuse of the arrest process.:The “Rainbow\n                        Spring”[2003] 3 SLR (R) 362 (“Rainbow Spring”) at [37]. It is also settled law\n                    that the court retains an overriding discretion whether or not to set aside an\n                    arrest for non-disclosure:The “Vasiliy\n                        Golovnin”[2008] 4 SLR(R) 994 (“The Vasiliy”) at [84] endorsingThe\n                        “Ferbienti”[1994] 3 SLR(R) 574 (“The Ferbienti”). 95     InThe Vasiliy,\n                    the Court of Appeal explained at [82] that the issue of material non-disclosure\n                    should be examined from two aspects:first, what\n                    ought to have been disclosed i.e.content and scope of\n                        disclosure, andsecond, the\n                    sufficiency of disclosure i.e.the threshold of\n                        disclosure. As to the content and scope of disclosure, the Court\n                    of Appeal stated at [87]: “87. Thetest of materiality is always an\n                            objective one. In the words of Prakash J inThe Rainbow Spring, the test is simply to ask\n                            “how relevant the fact is”\n                        [emphasis added](at [33]). However,the duty imposed on\n                            the applicant requires him to ask what might be relevant to the court in\n                            its assessment of whether or not the remedy should be\n                        granted, and not what the applicant alone might think is\n                        relevant.This inevitably embraces matters, both factual\n                            and legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the successful\n                            outcome of the applicant’s application.It extends toall material facts that could be reasonably\n                            ascertained and defences that might be reasonably raised by the\n                            defendant. It is important to stress, however, that theduty extends only to plausible, and not all\n                            conceivable or theoretical defences. For example, if there\n                        have been unsuccessful prior proceedings, the context as well as the reasons\n                        for the dismissal must be adequately disclosed. In short, the material facts\n                        are those which are material to enable the judge to make an informed\n                        decision” [emphases added] 96     InThe Eagle\n                        Prestigeat [72], the Honourable Justice Belinda Ang had occasion\n                    to analyse the reference to “plausible defence” inThe Vasiliy: “72. In my view, the expression “plausible defences” has to be understood in the light\n                        of the realities of the situation inThe Vasiliy Golvnin\n                            (CA). The claim was held to be “really implausible” and unsustainable; the point that\n                        the cause of action was frivolous and vexatious could easily be taken and\n                        determined summarily based on plainly cogent affidavit evidence. In a way,\n                        the expression “plausible\n                        defences” is being used loosely; the meaning of\n                            “plausible defences” may be\n                        culled from the context and surrounding circumstances. First,The Vasiliy Golovnin(CA) was a case falling under\n                        Situation 2 where the merits of the claim including the defences to the\n                        claim were examined. Second, from a broader perspective,plausible defences are matters referable to objections (factual and/or\n                            legal) to the claim being brought in the first place, or to the arrest\n                            being mounted at all.They are material facts which\n                        objectively speaking,are of such weight that their\n                            omission, at the application stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an\n                            abuse of process. Such an abuse of process is strictly\n                        speaking not a defence to the claim; it isan objection\n                            to the claim or arrest being brought an all.In the context\n                        of the duty to make full and frank disclosure, a failure to disclose\n                        material facts that constituted the abuse, would be a ground for discharging\n                        or setting aside the warrant of arrest for material non-disclosure 73. I now come to the reasons for holding the view that in the context of\n                        an application for a warrant of arrest, the duty to disclose\n                        “plausible defences” isnotgenerally directed at defences to the claim that may be raised at the trial\n                        in answer to the plaintiff’s claim but in a broader perspective tomatters that constitute an abuse of the arrest\n                            process(see [72] and [74]). In acase\n                            falling under Situation 2, there will be matters (factual and/or legal)\n                            of such weight as to deliver the “knock-out blow” to the\n                            claim summarily,and,on any reasonable view, their omission, at the application\n                            stage, is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of process.Thesematters are likely to be, or at the very least,\n                            overlap with defences that deliver the “knock out blow” to\n                            the claim summarily,andit istheir omission that is likely to or may mislead the\n                            court in the exercise of its discretionary powers of\n                        arrest. 75. …In my view, the non-disclosure of defences that the defendant\n                        could raise at the trial in answer to the plaintiffs’ claim (as that\n                        pertains to the ultimate merits of the action and the question of who is\n                        likely to win),are generally not characterised as a\n                            failure to give full and frank disclosure unless(and this is\n                        the qualification (ie, Situation 2) mentioned inThe St\n                            Elefterio(see [56] above) they arematters that show up the claim as an abuse of process, or one that is\n                            so obviously frivolous and vexatious as to be open to summary dismissal\n                            and, on any reasonable view, their omission, at the application stage,\n                            is tantamount to or constitutes an abuse of process. From a\n                        broader perspective, failure to disclose matters showing that the claim or\n                        arrest should not have been brought at all, are material facts that\n                        constitute the abuse of process. Simply put,they\n                            constitute matters of such weight that their omission is likely to or\n                            may mislead the court in the exercise of its discretionary power of\n                            arrest(see [72] above). [emphases added] 97     In essence, the point made by the learned\n                    Judge was that the duty to disclose “plausible defences” was not\n                    generally directed at defences on the merits that may be raised at the trial but\n                    referred to matters, which if not disclosed, would be tantamount to an abuse of\n                    the arrest process. A clear example of such matters, if omitted at the\n                    application stage, which would constitute an abuse of the arrest process were\n                        “matters (factual and/or legal) of such weight as\n                        to deliver the “knock-out blow” to the claim\n                        summarily”. 98     The learned Judge went on to conclude: “84. To summarise, in the light of the low threshold of the merits\n                        enquiry (ie, typically Situation 1 as in [54] above),the\n                            omission to refer to defences on the merits which the defendant may seek\n                            to raise in opposition of the plaintiff’s claim would not\n                            generally be characterised as a failure to make full and frank\n                            disclosure. This is the positionso long\n                            as it cannot be said that the action is an abuse of process, or that it\n                            is obviously frivolous and vexatious so as to be open to summary\n                            dismissal.Once thistipping point exists\n                            (as was the case in The Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)), there will be matters\n                            (factual and/or legal) which are of such weight as to deliver the\n                            “knock-out” blow to the claim summarily, and\n                        their omission is likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its\n                        discretionary powers of arrest, then these matters are material facts that\n                        will have to be disclosed (ie, Situation 2 as in [54] above). Equally, a\n                        failure to disclose facts which constituted the abuse of the arrest process\n                        would be ground for discharging or setting aside the warrant, whether under\n                        Situation is 1 or 2 (see [72], [74] and [75] and instances of abuse of the\n                        arrest process at [77] and [83] above).” 99     Cautioning against the undesirable practice of\n                    parties attempting to meticulously dissect the factual matrix to\n                    “invent” missing material facts upon which to mount non-disclosure\n                    challenges, the Court of Appeal inThe Vasiliyastutely observed at [88] and [90] that the assessment of what is material is\n                    ultimately a matter ofcommon senseand\n                    “the scope of disclosure should be what is reasonable in the given\n                    circumstances at the time of the arrest”. This point was echoed by the\n                    High Court inThe Eagle Prestige: 85. Paragraph [88] ofThe Vasiliy Golovnin\n                            (CA)warns against the “meticulous dissection of the\n                        factual matrix to ‘invent’ missing material facts”. Each\n                        case is fact-sensitive in terms of material facts advanced for consideration\n                        by the court. As Rajah JA observed, applying common sense, the scope of\n                        disclosure is based on“what is reasonable given\n                            the circumstances at the time of the arrest”(at\n                        [90])…” [emphases added] 100    In the final analysis, the approach of the\n                    Singapore courts as explained by the Court of Appeal inThe\n                        Bunga Melati 5at [116] and [117], is to strike an optimal\n                    balance between two equally important policy concerns of (i)allowing the liberal invokingof admiralty jurisdiction and (ii)preventing the abuseof the ship arrest\n                    process: “116. The position which we have reached here strikes an optimal\n                        balance between allowing theliberal invoking of\n                            admiralty jurisdiction (as the authorities helpfully cited by\n                        the Judge suggest) andpreventing “the abuse of\n                            the [ship] arrest process”(The\n                            Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)at [105]). The latter is as important a\n                        policy concern as the former.Prior tothe\n                        defendant successfully applying to strike out the plaintiff’s claim,\n                        the defendant could in the interim be inflicted by substantial financial\n                        losses due to the plaintiff’s completely unjustifiable arrest of its\n                        vessel. While these losses might subsequently be the subject of a wrongful\n                        arrest claim by the defendant, it is important to keep in mind that not all\n                        wrongful arrests, based on the current state of the law, warrants liability\n                        and damages (seeThe Vasiliy Golovnin (CA)at\n                        [128]); and even if damages are awarded, a plaintiff might not always be in\n                        a sound financial state to pay. 117. For that reason an assistant registrar hearing an application fora warrant of arrestmust act as the first\n                        “gatekeeper”against a completely unmeritorious claim, by\n                        refusing to grant the warrant should the plaintiff’s claim be\n                        supported byobviously insufficient or contradictory\n                            documentary evidence. However, we also caution that as it isnot the roleof the assistant registrarat that stageto determine thesustainabilityof the plaintiff’s action, he\n                        or she should refuse to grant leave in onlyplain cases\n                            of processoral abuse.” [emphases added]",
        "Section 3(1)(d) – Any claim for Damage done by a Ship": "26     Section 3(1)(d) provides that the admiralty\n                    jurisdiction of the court shall extend to “any claim for damage done by a\n                    ship”. 27     The main jurisdictional facts relied upon here\n                    are uncontroversial. It is not disputed that the “Phu Tan” sank\n                    and the 111 containers supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants which were\n                    on board the “Phu Tan” were lost. 28     However, there appeared to be some dispute on\n                    whether the sinking of the “Phu Tan” and the loss of the\n                    containers was caused by those engaged in the navigation or management of the\n                    ship. The Plaintiff submitted that the Investigation Conclusion No/\n                    256/BCDTCVHHHP dated 15 March 2011 (“Investigation Conclusion”)\n                    issued by the Hai Phong Port Authority revealed in its conclusions,inter aliathat the poor navigation of the ship and\n                    inappropriate actions taken by the master and crew in the navigation or\n                    operation of the ship led to the sinking and loss of the containers. The\n                    Defendant’s counsel on the other hand, brought to my attention a\n                    subsequent letter from the Hai Phong Port Authority dated 9 May 2011 which, they\n                    submitted, clarified that the bad weather condition was “the proximate\n                    cause of the incident, other contributing factors only considered as results of\n                    the bad weather condition”. In my view, the letter from the Hai Phong\n                    Port Authority dated 9 May 2011 was unclear. Whilst it stated that the bad\n                    weather condition was “the proximate cause of the incident”, it\n                    nevertheless still referred to the other factors as “contributing\n                    factors” and it did not expressly reject any of its earlier findings in\n                    the Investigation Conclusion. Having considered the totality of both documents,\n                    I would accept that the loss was caused by those engaged in the navigation or\n                    management of the ship. 29     The main issue argued before me by parties was\n                    whether the claim was of the legal character contemplated under section 3(1)(d)\n                    of the HC(AJ)A. Citing various authorities including the English authorities ofThe “Rama”[1996] 2\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 291 (“The Rama”),The “Escherscheim”[1976] 2\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 1 (“The\n                    Eschercheim”),The\n                        “Escherscheim”[1976] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 81 (Court\n                    of Appeal) (“The Eschercheim (CA)”),\n                    the Hong Kong decision ofThe “Asian\n                        Atlas”[2008] 3 HKC 169 (“The\n                        Asian Atlas”), as well as passages fromAdmiralty Law and Practice2ndEd.,\n                    Toh Kian Sing SC (“Admiralty Law and\n                        Practice”), Defendant’s counsel forcefully argued\n                    that it was settled law that the ship which causes damage under section 3(1)(d)\n                    does not refer to the carrying ship, which in the present case was the\n                    “Phu Tan”. 30     Underpinning this submission was the\n                    Defendants’ further contention that it was also well settled that the 3 -\n                    criteria test as set out inThe Rama(at 293)\n                    would apply. InThe Rama, Clarke J opined that in\n                    order for there to be “damage done by a ship”, 3 criteria must be\n                    satisfied: (a)     The damage must be caused by\n                        something done by those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship\n                        in a physical sense; (b)     The ship must be the actual or noxious instrument by which the damage\n                        is done; and (c)     The damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship.\n                        (“externality requirement”) Specifically, the Defendant’s counsel contended that the\n                        3rdcriterion (i.e. the externality requirement -\n                    that the damage must be sustained by a person or property external to the ship)\n                    was not met in the present case where the “Phu Tan” sank with the\n                    containers on board (and not external) to the ship. Defendant’s counsel\n                    further submitted, as a secondary point, that even if it was accepted that the\n                        3rdcriteria of externality was not a\n                    requirement, then on the facts of this case it was clear that the\n                        2ndrequirement of the ship being the noxious\n                    instrument of damage was not satisfied as the “Phu Tan” merely\n                    sank with the containers on board and was therefore only a passive environment\n                    and not the instrument of damage. 31     Plaintiff’s counsel on the other hand\n                    pointed out that it was by no means settled law that the\n                        3rdcriterion of externality as set out inThe Ramawas applicable to determine if\n                    jurisdiction was validly invoked under section 3(1)(d). She argued that prior toThe Rama, 2 main requirements, were laid down\n                    by the House of Lords inThe Eschercheimat 926g:\n                    (1) that the damage is the direct result or consequence of something done by\n                    those in the navigation of the ship; and (2) the ship must be the actual\n                    instrument by which the damage was done, with the important qualifier that\n                    physical contact between the ship and the object damaged was not essential. In\n                    her submission, insofar as theRamahad introduced\n                    a 3rdcriterion of externality, it seemed to be an\n                    additional requirement to the 2 main propositions inThe\n                        Eschercheimand one which was not supported by strong authority.\n                    The earlier English authorities such asThe\n                        “Tolten”[1946] P 135 (“The Tolten”) appeared not to insist on this\n                        3rdrequirement of externality, inThe Toltenat 158, the court found that “cause of\n                    damage” was not limited to cases involving collisions between ships but\n                    that there could be jurisdiction “whenever …negligent navigation\n                    caused damage with or without collision” and that such damage could\n                    include damage to any property whether moveable or immoveable. There was no\n                    externality requirement. 32     Plaintiff’s counsel then argued that\n                    there were Australian and New Zealand authorities to the effect that the\n                        3rdcriterion of externality was not a\n                    requirement for there to be a claim within the ambit of section 3(1)(d). The\n                    cases she relied on were - from Australia:The\n                        “Regis”(1939 61 CLR 688 (“The Regis”),Union Steamship\n                        Co of New Zealand Ltd v Ferguson(1969)\n                    (“Ferguson”) 119 CLR 191; and from New Zealand:Fournier v The Ship “Margaret Z”[1999] 3 NZLR 111\n                    (“Margaret Z”). In essence, Plaintiff’s counsel argued that\n                    based on these authorities, the Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim\n                    came was of the type and nature contemplated under section\n                3(1)(d). 33     InThe Regis,\n                    the Australian High Court found that it hadin remjurisdiction (under the equivalent jurisdictional limb) over a claim suffered by\n                    a passenger against the vessel carrying him for negligent navigation resulting\n                    in its capsizing and causing personal injury to him. In my reading, a key point\n                    can be taken fromThe Registhat tells in favour\n                    of the Plaintiff and it is this - the facts of the case there involved a\n                    capsizing which caused injury to the claimant. This is analogous to the present\n                    case where the “Phu Tan” sank with the 111 containers on board. I\n                    do not agree with Defendant’s counsel’s suggestion thatThe Regiswas a case where the ship was indeed found to\n                    be the instrument of damage because itstruckthe\n                    claimant (and not just because it capsized). Nothing in the judgment suggests\n                    that the decision there turned on this fact. Rather, the court in the final\n                    analysis (at 700) drew the distinction between: (a)     injury which “arises from\n                        some defect in the condition of the ship considered as premises or as a\n                        structure upon which the person injured is standing, walking or\n                        moving…[such that] …the ship is treated as no more than a\n                        potential danger of apassive kind”\n                        [emphasis added]; and (b)     injury which “is the result of the management or navigation of\n                        the ship as a moving object or of the working of the gear or of some other\n                        operation…[such that]…the damage is to be regarded as done by\n                        the ship as …the “noxious\n                    instrument””. 34     The court inThe\n                        Registhen held (in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment) on\n                    the facts of that case that “the improper navigation of the ship caused\n                    her so to behave thatshe capsized[making no\n                    reference to the fact of the shipstrikingthe\n                    claimant].Her behaviour as an active agent was the direct\n                        cause of the harmand in that sense she was the noxious\n                    instrument” [emphases added]. In my reading, this case supports the view\n                    that a ship which capsizes and causes damage can be considered to be the\n                    instrument of damage and not merely a passive environment. 35     Another relevant authority for consideration\n                    is theMargaret Zwhere the New Zealand High Court\n                    at 122 - 123 considered the question whether an injured person or object must be\n                    “external to the ship” and decided that it did not. Referring\n                    directly to the 3rd criterion of externality prescribed inThe Rama, Fisher J stated that he did not think “too much\n                    could be read into Clark J’s use of the word\n                    “external””. He acknowledged that there was a\n                    “floodgates risk of bringing shipboard accidents into the scope of the\n                    damage maritime lien.Cargo damage claims, for example might\n                        qualify” [emphasis added] but concluded that “the\n                    precedents seem too far advanced to put the clock back in this respect”\n                    and that the main requirement was whether damage was “done by the\n                    ship” rather than the location of the accident. 36     In response, Defendant’s counsel sought\n                    to cast doubt on the decisions ofMargaret ZandThe Regisby submitting that these cases were\n                    doubted in another New Zealand authority,Ultimate Lady Ltd v\n                        The Ship “Northern Challenger”AD 7/00 dated 10\n                    August 2000 (“Northern Challenger”).\n                    I agree with the Plaintiff’s counsel that Defendan’s counsel’s\n                    submission was misconceived. InNorthern\n                        Challenger, Williams J cited theMargaret\n                        ZandThe Regisbut did not reject\n                    or doubt the legal propositions as stated in those cases. More significantly, at\n                    the subsequent main trial on the meritsUltimate Lady Ltd v\n                        The Ship “Northern Challenger”(No 2) AD7-SW2000 at\n                    [165] – [171], Williams Jcited and applied The\n                        RegisandMargaret Zand did not\n                    cast any doubt on those decisions. 37     In the final analysis, I find that the\n                    Plaintiff has an arguable case that their claim is of the nature and type\n                    contemplated under section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. My analysis is as\n                    follows: (a)     First, I accept on the basis of the\n                        Investigation Conclusion that the damage was caused by something done by\n                        those engaged in the navigation or management of the ship in a physical\n                        sense; (b)     On the\n                        authority ofThe Regis, I am satisfied that,\n                        as was the present case, a ship can be said to be the instrument of damage\n                        or noxious instrument when it capsizes or sinks and as a result causes\n                        injury or damage. To my mind, there is a clear difference between a ship\n                        being a mere passive environment, premise or structure on which damage\n                        occurred and a ship physically capsizing/sinking and causing the damage as\n                        an active agent; (c)     The question of whetherThe\n                            Rama’s3rdcriterion of\n                        externality is a requirement to ground jurisdiction under section 3(1)(d)\n                        appearsnotto have been conclusively\n                        determined as a matter of Singapore law and neither party contended\n                        otherwise before me; (d)     I agree with the Plaintiff’s submission that the earlier\n                        English authorities, principallyThe\n                            Eschercheim, had not insisted on this\n                            3rdcriterion of externality and had focused\n                        the inquiry on whether the damage was the caused by something done by those\n                        engaged in the navigation or management of the ship and on whether the\n                        damage was done by the ship as an instrument of damage. It is significant to\n                        note that based onThe Eschercheim, physical\n                        contact between the ship and the object damaged is not essential. Indeed inThe Eschercheim, the damage was caused by\n                        the negligent beaching of the ship by the salvage tug leading to the ship\n                        being exposed to the harmful effects of the elements; (e)     The 3rdrequirement of externality stated inThe Rama,\n                        appears to be premised on two cases briefly referred to in the judgment:The “Victoria”(1887) 12 PD\n                        105 (“The Victoria”) andThe “Igor”[1956] 2\n                        Lloyd’s Rep 271 (“The\n                        Igor”). I would note however, thatThe\n                            Victoriawas decided prior toThe\n                            Eschercheim.InThe Victoria,\n                        the court appeared to readily accept, without elaboration or analysis, the\n                        defendant’s contention that this jurisdictional limb only applied\n                        “to damage done by a vessel to somethingwith\n                            which it can come in contact, and not to cargo on\n                        board.” (emphasis added) In the light of the subsequent House of\n                        Lords decision inThe Eschercheimthat\n                        physical contact between the ship and the object sustaining the damage isnot essential, there is some doubt whetherThe Victoriawould have been decided in\n                        the same manner. As forThe Igor, it too was\n                        decided prior toThe Eschercheim, the judgment\n                        appears to have been concerned with a claim for damage to goods carried in a\n                        ship rather than a claim for “damage done by a ship” and in my\n                        view, it is difficult to find therein any support for the\n                            3rdrequirement of\n                    externality; (f)     As toThe Asian Atlas, in my reading, the Hong\n                        Kong Court of Appeal clearly appliedThe Rama.\n                        However, it must be appreciated that the facts of that case did not require\n                        the court to consider the issue of whether a claim for “damage done\n                        by a ship” applies when the damage is suffered by property on board\n                        the relevant ship. The externality requirement was applied to the question\n                        of whether it was fulfilled when there was damage sustained by the ship\n                        herself and this was plainly answered in the negative. Given that this issue\n                        was not squarely before the court, unsurprisingly, it appears that the court\n                        there was not referred to the other line of authorities inThe Margaret Z, The RegisandFergusonand did not hear arguments on the\n                    issue; (g)     The\n                            3rdrequirement of externality introduced byThe Ramawould appear to unnecessarily\n                        restrict the ambit of this jurisdictional limb and is not supported by\n                        strong authority. I see no reason in principle why a claim should not come\n                        within this jurisdictional limb just because the damage occurred on the ship\n                        even though the ship was in fact the instrument of\n                damage. 38     I am fortified in my views by the following\n                    passages of the authoritative textbookAdmiralty Law and\n                        Practice, where the learned author astutely observed thatThe Ramaintroduced an additional requirement\n                    of externality, specifically referred toThe Regis, Margaret\n                        Z, and expressed the following views: “theadditional requirementof injury\n                        or damage sustainedexternalto a vesselis not always justifiable, especially in\n                        the context of personal injury caused by the instrumentality of the\n                        ship” [emphases added] (see pg 56) “In the decision ofThe Rama, Clarke\n                        Jappeared to have added anotherrequirement\n                        to the accrual of a damage lien, namely, that the damage must be sustained\n                        by a person or property external to the ship. This would rule out a claim\n                        for dmage or loss of cargo carried on board or for loss of life or personal\n                        injury sustained on board a ship which was the instrument of damage. There\n                        are authorities suggesting that a maritime lien does exist in respect of\n                        personal injury sustained on board a ship.While the\n                            requirement of instrumentality of the ship is more evidently seen in the\n                            case of damage caused to persons or property external to her, earlier\n                            authorities have not insisted on such a requirement.This additional requirement introduces an undesirable\n                            element of fortuity and it is significant to note that the New Zealand\n                            High Court [citing Margaret Z] has rejected it.”\n                        [emphases added] (see pg 257) I would agree with the learned author’s view that as far as\n                    the 3rdcriterion of externality is concerned,\n                        “earlier authorities have not insisted on such a\n                        requirement.This additional requirement\n                        introduces an undesirable element of fortuity and it is significant to note\n                        that the New Zealand High Court [citing Margaret Z] has rejected\n                        it.” [emphasis added] 39     For good measure, Plaintiff’s counsel\n                    also brought my attention to a commentary inThe Law and\n                        Practice of Admiralty Matters(Oxford 2007), Sarah C. Derrington,\n                    James M. Turner wherein at [4.22] the authors state, correctly in my view, that\n                    the holding inMargaret Zwas consistent with\n                    Australian authority on the point that there is no requirement that the injury\n                    or damage that is sustained has to be external to the vessel. In my view,\n                    insofar as it can be said thatThe Ramarepresents\n                    the English position on the issue, the law appears to have developed in a\n                    different direction in Australia and New Zealand. Here I observe that the\n                    Singapore courts have been quite prepared to depart from English decisions in\n                    the realm of shipping and admiralty law to evolve its own jurisprudence in this\n                    area. Decisions such asThe Permina 108[1974\n                    – 1976] SLR (R) 850 suffice to illustrate this point. 40     In the premises, I find that the\n                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. As stated\n                    earlier, I agree with counsel for the Plaintiff that as long as jurisdiction was\n                    found under any of the limbs in section 3(1)(d), (g) or (l), it would suffice to\n                    bring the claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. Nevertheless,\n                    for completeness, I turn now to set out my observations on whether the\n                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(g).",
        "Section 3(1)(g) – Any claim for loss of or damage to goods\n                carried in a ship": "41     Section 3(1)(g) provides that the admiralty\n                    jurisdiction of the court shall extend to any claim in respect of “loss\n                    or damage to goods carried in a ship”. 42     The undisputed jurisdictional facts the\n                    Plaintiffs relied on were that the “Phu Tan” sank and the 111\n                    containers supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants which were on board the\n                    “Phu Tan” were lost. 43     The main dispute centered once more on whether\n                    the Plaintiff’s had an arguable case that their claim fell within the\n                    ambit of section 3(1)(g), HC(AJ)A. Counsel for the Defendant referring to The\n                        “Mezen”[2006] SGHC 35,The Escherscheim (CA)and passages fromAdmiralty Law and Practice., argued that\n                    section 3(1)(g) applies only in respect of “goods carried as\n                    cargo” and “cargo” claims, the containers were not cargo\n                    and therefore did not fall within the ambit of the phrase “goods carried\n                    in a ship”. 44     The key passage ofThe\n                        Mezenat [18] states as follows: “I decided thatThe Eschersheimwas\n                        correct that in the context of section 3(1)(g), “goods”\n                        carried in a ship referred to goods carried as cargo on board a ship, in\n                        other words, things or items carried on board a vessel for the purpose of\n                        being conveyed or transported from one place to another.” 45     Plaintiff’s counsel submitted before me\n                    that the 111 containers fell within the definition of “goods”\n                    under section 3(1)(g). Referring to the passage ofThe\n                        Mezenas out above, she submitted that although the court\n                    referred to the term “goods” as cargo carried on board a ship, the\n                    court inThe Mezenhad further explained that\n                    “cargo” referred to things or items carried on board a vessel for\n                    the purpose of being conveyed or transported from one place to another.\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel further referred to the Scottish decision of“The Steve Irwin” [2011] CSOH 112\n                        (“The Steve Irwin”) where at\n                    [26] the court was prepared to accept that the tuna and transportation cages\n                    (although less plausibly so) which were on tow by the vessel and which suffered\n                    damage should qualify as “goods carried in a ship”.\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel’s final point was that in the context of a claim\n                    under section 20(2)(m) of the UK Supreme Court Act 1981 (which is inpari materialto section 3(1)(l) of our HC(AJ)A), the\n                    House of Lords inThe “River Rima”[1988] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 193 (“The River\n                        Rima”) held at pg 195 that “containers are\n                    “goods” within the meaning of par. (m)”, therefore it was\n                    submitted, there should be no difference in the meaning of “goods”\n                    used in the context of section 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A. 46     All things considered, I find that the\n                    Plaintiff doesnothave an arguable case that\n                    their claim is of the nature and type contemplated under section 3(1)(g): (a)     In my reading, althoughThe Mezendid not deal with the issue of whether\n                        containers can be considered as “goods” within the meaning of\n                        section 3(1)(g), the court rightly accepted thatThe\n                            Eschercheimwas correct and that in the context of section\n                        3(1)(g), “goods” referred to goods carried as cargo on board a\n                        ship. It is clear that the court rejected the wide definitions of\n                        “goods” to include “all chattels of which possession is\n                        possible notwithstanding that they are not easily moveable”,\n                        “whatever conveyed in a ship” or “the load carried in a\n                        ship” (proposed by the plaintiff at [13]). The court’s\n                        reference to “things or items carried on board a vessel for the\n                        purpose of being conveyed or transported from one place to another”\n                        must therefore be understood in the context of its clear finding that\n                        “goods” referred to “goodscarried\n                            as cargoon board a ship”; (b)     On a plain reading of the words\n                        “goods carried in a ship” and in the historical context of\n                        this jurisdictional limb (i.e. that it evolved from section 6 of the\n                        Admiralty Court Act 1861) I agree that this jurisdictional limb should be\n                        understood as being applied to cargo-owners claims against the ship to which\n                        he has entrusted his cargo. It would be an extension to include under this\n                        limb a claim for loss of containers used to store the cargo carried on a\n                        container ship; (c)     I do not accept the Plaintiff’s submission that “goods”\n                        was defined to include “containers” in section 3(1)(l) and so\n                        should be accorded the same meaning in section 3(1)(g). It is clear to me\n                        that the phrases in the various jurisdictional limbs are terms of art which\n                        must be understood with reference to authority: seeThe\n                            Eschercheimat 926g. In any event, section 3(1)(l) pertains\n                        to “goods …supplied to a shipfor her\n                            operationand maintenance” and is therefore apt to\n                        encompass containers on board for the operation of a container ship. Section\n                        3(1)(g) on the other hand refers to “goods carried on a ship”\n                        with no such interpretative flavour as provided by the words (appearing in\n                        section 3(1)(l)) “supplied…for her operation and\n                        maintenance”; (d)     The slender authority relied on by the Plaintiff’s counsel\n                        appeared to beThe Steve Irwinbut I note that\n                        the statements there were inobiter, without\n                        detailed analysis and heavily qualified. I note that even there, the court\n                        stated that it was “less plausibly so” that the transportation\n                        cages carrying the tuna could fall within the scope of the phrase\n                        “goods carried in a ship”. In my view, such slender authority\n                        would not suffice to demonstrate that the Plaintiff has an arguable case\n                        that its claim is of the type and nature contemplated under section\n                        3(1)(g). 47     In the premises, I would observe that the\n                    Plaintiff’s claimdoes notfall within\n                    section 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A. I turn now to consider whether the\n                    Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(l) of the\n                HC(AJ)A.",
        "Section 3(1)(l) – any claim in respect of goods or materials\n                supplied to a ship for her operation and maintenance": "48     Section 3(1)(l) provides that the admiralty\n                    jurisdiction extends to any claims in respect of “loss or damage to goods\n                    carried in a ship”. 49     As I understand it, the Plaintiff’s\n                    argument was premised on the following propositions, each of which, save for\n                    (a), is disputed by the Defendant: (a)     The 2010 CLC was a contract entered\n                        into with the Defendants, Vinalines; (b)     The translation of the 2010 CLC relied upon by the\n                        Plaintiffs was not false and is correct; (c)     The 2010 CLC expressly or impliedly provide for\n                        the supply of containers for use on the Defendant’s\n                    ships; (d)     The 111\n                        containers were supplied pursuant to the 2010 CLC; (e)     The container loading list by the Tan\n                        Thuan Port Record database is authentic and shows that the 111 containers\n                        were loaded onto the “Phu Tan” for the particular\n                        voyage; (f)     Containers have been held to be “goods” within the meaning of\n                        section 3(1)(l) and the court inThe River\n                            Rimawas prepared to accept without deciding the point that\n                        the use of a container on board a ship designed to carry containers is a use\n                        for the operation of such a ship; (g)     To bring a claim under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A,\n                        there is no need for the name of the ship on which the containers are to be\n                        supplied to be identified in the contract of supply or even at the time of\n                        performance of the contract of supply so long as at the time of actual\n                        supply, the ship is identified. 50     It would be useful at this point to recognise\n                    that the matters set out in (a) to (e) can be seen as jurisdictional facts under\n                    limb 3(1)(l) that the Plaintiffs have to prove on a balance of probabilities\n                    whilst the matters set out in (f) and (g) go to the assessment of whether the\n                    claim is of the type or nature envisaged under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A.\n                    My analysis proceeds on this basis. (a) - The 2010 CLC was a contract entered into with the Defendants,\n                Vinalines 51     This issue can be shortly dealt with. In the\n                    affidavit of Tran Phuong Thuy filed on behalf of the Defendants on 31 July 2013,\n                    the Defendant has stated that “they are willing to assume for the\n                    purposes of the application, that the Defendants were a party to the Container\n                    Lease Contract No. 500710T/2010/HD – VCSC … dated 1 June 2010 with\n                    the Plaintiff…”. 52     Even if a contrary position had been taken by\n                    the Defendant, had I required to do so, I would have found that the Defendant,\n                    Vinalines were the contractual counterparty to the 2010 CLC. The clear evidence\n                    on this was the Explanatory Statement dated 8 May 2013, sent in the name of\n                    “Vietnam Container Shipping Company – Branch of Vietnam National\n                    Shipping Lines” to the Vietnamese Court stating,inter\n                        alia, that: “…VCSC only actedon behalf of\n                            Vinalinesto sign the lease contract with Hung Dao Container\n                        Joint Stock Company. Accordingly,the rights and\n                            obligations under the container lease contract will be at\n                            Vinalines’ account. In fact, Vinalines has sent to the\n                        Court the document on appointment of its Authorized Representative to\n                        participate in the proceedings as the Defendant in the above case.”\n                        [emphases added] (b) and (c) - The veracity of the Plaintiff’s translation of\n                the 2010 CLC and whether the 2010 CLC expressly or impliedly provided for the supply\n                of containers for use on the Defendant’s ships 53     I deal with (b) and (c) together. The\n                    Plaintiff’s translation of the 2010 CLC was disputed by the Defendant as\n                    being false in two aspects. At the heart of the dispute was Art 1.1 of the 2010\n                    CLC which, in the Plaintiff’s translation which appears in the Arrest\n                    Affidavit, states: “Party A agrees to lease the equipments (hereinafter abbreviated\n                        “Containers”)In Party A’s\n                            possessionto Party B for shipping its goodson Party B’s ships”. [emphases\n                        added] 54     The Defendants produced and relied on two\n                    translations: First translation (1stAffidavit of Ly Quang Long dated 16 July 2013) “Party A [Hung Dao] agrees with Party B [VCSC] on equipment leasing\n                        (hereinafter called “container”) which is beingowned by Party Ain order to transport the cargoby sea mode by Party B”. [emphases\n                        added] Second Translation (4thAffidavit of Tran Phuong Thuy dated 22 January 2014) “Party A [Hung Dao] agrees Party B [VCSC] to lease the equipment\n                        (hereinafter referred to as “Container”) under theownership of Party Ato transport commoditieson sea routes of Party B”.\n                        [emphases added] 55     The Defendant contended that the\n                    Plaintiff’s translation of the 2010 CLC was false as the phrase “In\n                    Party A’s possession” should be translated as “owned by\n                    Party A” and the phrase “Party B’s ships” should be\n                    translated as either “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea\n                    routes of Party B”. The Defendant’s contention was underpinned by\n                    their submission that the Plaintiff had deliberately procured a false\n                    translation of Art 1.1 of the 2010 CLC to mislead the court into allowing an\n                    arrest under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A. 56     I am unable to agree with the\n                    Defendant’s assertion. To begin with, I note that the Plaintiffs’\n                    translation as well the Defendants’ two translations were all, on the face\n                    of it, official certified translations produced by the Justice Office of Binh\n                    Hanh District. There is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that any of these\n                    three official certified translations are unreliable. In my view, the\n                    explanation for the differences in translations is that this simply reflects the\n                    inexactitude inherent in the process of translating between different languages.\n                    To put it another way, I accept that the Vietnamese contractual terms can be\n                    correctly expressed in English within a range of literal to dynamic\n                    translations, all of which can properly be said to capture the essence of the\n                    terms in the original Vietnamese language. 57     The next question I consider is whether, based\n                    on a holistic view of the 3 different translations of Art 1.1 of the 2010 CLC,\n                    it can be said that the 2010 CLC provides for the supply of containers for use\n                    on the Defendant’s ships. In my view, it does. My reasons are as\n                    follows: (a)     In the context of the scale of\n                        dynamic to literal translations I have referred to earlier, the phrase\n                        “on Party B’s ships” can be seen as a dynamic\n                        translation whilst the phrases “by sea mode by Party B” and\n                        “on sea routes of Party B” are apt to reflect a more literal\n                        translation. In my view, the phrases that containers are to be used\n                        “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea routes of Party\n                        B” can conceivably express the idea that the containers are to be\n                        supplied for use on Party B’s ships; (b)     The Defendant’s further contention was\n                        that according to their 2 “true translations”, the phrase\n                        “by sea mode by Party B” or “on sea routes of Party\n                        B” could also be wide enough to cover situations where the containers\n                        were supplied for use on shipsnot belonging to Party\n                            B. They further asserted in an affidavit filed by Nguyen Ngoc\n                        Thuy Van on 7 Apr 2014 that “the containers are sometimes used on\n                        trucks”. In my view, the documentary evidence available shows clearly\n                        that the containers were indeed used on the Defendant’s ships. There\n                        is no documentary evidence to show either that the containers were put onto\n                        ships belonging to persons other than the Defendants or that the containers\n                        were used for the carriage of goods on containers over land. I agree with\n                        the Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission that the parties’\n                        conduct reflected the nature of their agreement under the 2010 CLC. Based on\n                        the available evidence, I am satisfied that the 2010 CLC did provide that\n                        containers are to be supplied for use on Party B’s\n                    ships. (d) - Whether the 111 containers were leased under the 2010\n                CLC 58     In the course of the hearing, evidence\n                    surfaced that of the 111 containers, 99 were in fact in the possession of the\n                    Defendants prior to the execution of the 2010 CLC between the parties. Further\n                    evidence also emerged that there was a prior 2006 agreement between the parties\n                    (which ended in 2007), that these 99 containers had been supplied to the\n                    Defendants in 2007, 2008 and 2009, and that between August 2007 and May 2010\n                    there was in fact no written agreement in place for the supply of the containers\n                    between the parties. 59     Based on these revelations, the\n                    Defendants’ contended that the 111 containers were not leased under the\n                    2010 CLC but instead were supplied by the Plaintiffs to the Defendants under\n                    another earlier 2006 agreement or at periods in time where there was no written\n                    agreement between the parties. I note here that counsel for the Defendants had\n                    also relied on this contention to further argue that this demonstrated that\n                    paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit was misleading and constituted material\n                    non-disclosure but that is a separate issue which is addressed below at [109] to\n                    [113]. 60     Returning to the main question of whether the\n                    111 containers were leased under the 2010 CLC. The Plaintiff accepted that the\n                    99 containers were picked up by the Defendants before the execution of the 2010\n                    CLC. However they argued that this did not detract from the fact that so far as\n                    the Defendants continued to lease the containers for use on their ships, the 111\n                    containers were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC once the 2010 CLC had come into\n                    effect between the parties. The Plaintiff relied mainly on the Defendant’s\n                    letter dated 10 March 2011 wherein the Defendant themselves had written to the\n                    Plaintiffs to inform them that their 111 containers leased under the 2010 CLC\n                    had been on board the “Phu Tan” and were a “total\n                    loss” as a result of the sinking of the “Phu Tan” on 16\n                    December 2010. The Plaintiff further contended that the Defendant had by their\n                    conduct all along accepted that the 111 containers were leased pursuant to the\n                    2010 CLC and had only now belatedly raised this as an issue. 61     On the available evidence, I am satisfied that\n                    the 111 containers were leased under the 2010 CLC. The clearest evidence in my\n                    view, is the Defendant’s own letter dated 10 March 2011 informing the\n                    Plaintiff that the 111 containers leased under the 2010 CLC and which were on\n                    board the “Phu Tan” were a total loss as a result of the sinking\n                    of the “Phu Tan”. The fact that 99 of the 111 containers were\n                    already in the Defendant’s possession prior to the execution of the 2010\n                    CLC is equivocal at best. It does not conclusively prove that the 99 containers\n                    did not come within the scope of the 2010 CLC. On the contrary, the\n                    Defendant’s letter dated 10 March 2011 pointed clearly to the\n                    parties’ intentions and understanding that the 111 containers did come\n                    within the ambit of the 2010 CLC. (e) - Whether the container loading list of the Tan Thuan Port record\n                database in Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit is authentic 62     The dispute here was on the authenticity of\n                    the container loading list which was exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit\n                    (“Container Loading List”). In the Arrest Affidavit, the Plaintiff\n                    had relied on this Container Loading List to show that the 111 containers were\n                    carried on board the Phu Tan on that ill-fated voyage. The Defendant argued that\n                    the Container Loading List was not an authentic document. In the affidavit of\n                    Nguyen Ngoc Thuy Van dated 7 April 2014, the Defendant exhibited a letter from\n                    one Mr Mai Van Cu, who is said to be a director of the Tan Thuan Port\n                    authorities and in this letter, Mr Mai stated that the Tan Thuan Port\n                    “didn’t supply the container Loading List that loaded on the M.V\n                    Phu Tan to Hung Dao Container Joint Stock Company”. 63     The Plaintiff argued in response that the\n                    Container Loading List exhibited at Tab 10 of their Arrest Affidavit was\n                    authentic and was supplied by the Tan Thuan Port Authorities. They referred to\n                    the email correspondence found at pg 124 of the Arrest Affidavit which shows an\n                    email sent from the “Tan Thuan Port, Container Operation\n                    Department” to the Plaintiff’s operation manager Mr Hieu, which\n                    purports to enclose the Container Loading List as an attachment. The Plaintiff\n                    further contended that taken at face value, the letter from Mr Mai which the\n                    Defendants’ relied on does not clearly show whether it was speaking in\n                    relation to the Container Loading List for the particular voyage of the\n                    “Phu Tan” on which it sank or for some other voyage. 64     On the available evidence, I am prepared to\n                    accept that the Container Loading List exhibited in the Arrest Affidavit was\n                    provided by the Tan Thuan Port and is authentic for the following reasons.\n                    First, the Defendant’s own 10 March 2011 letter sent to the Plaintiff\n                    identified the 111 containers and these 111 containers correspond to the records\n                    in the Container Loading List. Second, there is no forensic evidence to suggest\n                    that the email from “Tan Thuan Port, Container Operation\n                    Department” or the attached Container Loading List was falsified. As for\n                    the letter from Mr Mai (relied upon by the Defendant), I would agree with the\n                    Plaintiff that is unclear as to whether it related to the particular voyage of\n                    the “Phu Tan” on which it sank. Even if I accepted, for the\n                    benefit of the Defendant, that the letter from Mr Mai was in relation to the\n                    particular ill-fated voyage of the “Phu Tan”, then the Defendant\n                    has at best raised conflicting affidavit evidence on this point before me and\n                    all things considered I would find that the Container Loading List exhibited at\n                    Tab 10 of the Plaintiff’s Arrest Affidavit is authentic. 65     Having addressed, what is in my view, the\n                    relevant jurisdictional facts the Plaintiff relied upon to establish admiralty\n                    jurisdiction under section 3(1)(l), I turn now to examine the centrepiece of the\n                    Plaintiff’s arguments on the invocation of admiralty jurisdiction under\n                    section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A. (f) and (g) – Is the Plaintiff’s claim arguably of the\n                type and nature contemplated under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A 66     The parties’ arguments centred onThe “River Rima”[1988] 2\n                    Lloyd’s Rep 193 (“The River\n                        Rima”) where the House of Lords examined section 20(2)(m)\n                    of the Supreme Court Act 1981 which is inpari\n                        materiato section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A). The other key\n                    authorities relied upon by the Plaintiff’s counsel were the Australian\n                    authorities ofThe “Bass Reefer”[1992] FCA 378 (“The Bass Reefer”)\n                    andPatrick Steverdores No 2 Pty Ltd v MV\n                        “Turakina”[1998] FCA 16900 (“The Turakina”). 67     As to proposition (f), the Plaintiff’s\n                    counsel submitted that containers have been held to be “goods”\n                    within the meaning of section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A and that the court inThe River Rima(at 763B) was prepared to\n                    accept without deciding the point that the use of a container on board a ship\n                    designed to carry containers is a use for the operation of such a ship. The\n                    Defendant did not dispute this and I accept this as correct. 68     The main dispute was in relation to\n                    proposition (g). In essence, Plaintiff’s counsel’s submission was\n                    premised on the legal proposition that to bring a claim under section 3(1)(l) of\n                    the HC(AJ)A, there is no need for the ship to which the containers are to be\n                    supplied to be identified in the contract of supplyor even\n                        at the time of performance of the contract of supplyso long asat the time of the actual supply to the ship, the ship is\n                        sufficiently identified. 69     I set out the key passage inThe River Rima(at 763C) for consideration: “It is clear that paragraph (m) contemplates a contract of supply,\n                        whether by sale or hire, between the claimant and a shipowner. But the\n                        expression used in paragraph (m) is “supplied to a ship” and\n                        not “supplied to a shipowner”. The question is what meaning\n                        should be given to the former expression. There are two main kinds of\n                        contract pursuant to which goods or materials required for the operation of\n                        a ship may reach her. Thefirst kind of\n                            contractis one whichexpressly\n                            providesthat the goods or materials are required for the use\n                        ofa particular ship, the identity of which isspecified in the contractorwill be specifiedby thetime the\n                            contract comes to be performed. Thesecond\n                            kind of contractis one which contains no reference to a\n                        particular ship for the use of which goods or materials are required,\n                        leaving the shipowner to make his own decision about that later. The first\n                        kind of contract is, in my opinion, a contract under which goods or\n                        materials are “supplied to a ship” within the meaning of par.\n                        (m)” [emphases added] 70     In my understanding, the Plaintiff’s\n                    counsel’s arguments proceeded as follows: (a)The River\n                            Rimarequirement (at 763C) was that for there to be goods\n                        “supplied to a ship” within the meaning of the jurisdictional\n                        limb, the identity of the particular ship should be specified in the supply\n                        contract orwill be specified by the time when the\n                            contract comes to be performed; (b)     The court inThe Bass\n                            ReeferconsideredThe River\n                            Rimaand concluded that the specification of the ship need\n                        not be express butcould be implied from the\n                            circumstancesat thetime when the supply\n                            was actually made to the ship. The matter must be looked at\n                        the time the services were supplied and the question determined at that\n                        time, whether as a question of fact there was a supply to a ship within the\n                        meaning of the jurisdictional limb. (c)     The court inThe Turakinaapplied the approach of implied identification of the ship as set out in theThe Bass Reeferand agreed that the\n                        question was whetherat the time the services are\n                            provided(and not at the time the contract is entered into),\n                        there was sufficient identification of the ship. (d)     It did not matter that the 2010 CLC\n                        did not specifically identify the “Phu Tan” or that the\n                        containers were earlier loaded onto other ships, as at the material time,\n                        the “Phu Tan” was in fact identified as the ship on which the\n                        111 containers were supplied to and this is evidenced by the Container\n                        Loading List from the Than Thuan Port authority. (e)     The Plaintiff’s claim did not\n                        fall withinThe River Rimasituation and on\n                        the authority ofThe Bass ReeferandThe Turakina, the claim arguably is one in respect\n                        of goods “supplied to a ship”. 71     The Defendant’s counsel disagreed with\n                    Plaintiff’s submissions. His key argument was that the 2010 CLC was always\n                    a contract of the second kind as described inThe River\n                        Rima. He further argued that even in the implied identification\n                    test employed inThe Bass Reefer, it remained a\n                    requirement that the supply was to be limited to “a particular\n                    ship” and would not avail the Plaintiff as their 2010 CLC was, even by\n                    their own translation, a contract for the supply of containers to the\n                    Defendants’ ships and not limited specifically to the “Phu\n                    Tan”. 72     On this issue, I hold that the Plaintiffdoes nothave an arguable case that their\n                    claim falls within the ambit of section 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A. My analysis\n                    follows: (a)The River\n                            Rimaessentially distinguished between services rendered to a\n                        shipowner and services rendered to the ship itself. The court there first\n                        recognised that this jurisdictional limb contemplated a contract of supply,\n                        it then drew the distinction between a supply contract which was a contract\n                        for the provision of services to a ship (the first kind of contract) and a\n                        supply contract which was in reality a contract for the provision of\n                        services to a shipowner (the second kind of contract). In analysing when the\n                        first kind of contract existed, the court explained that this would be the\n                        case where the ship was specifically identified in the supply contract\n                        itself or where the identity of the ship was specified bythe time the supply contract came to be performed. It should\n                        be noted that the Singapore courts have, inThe\n                            “Alexandrea”[2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 at [29]\n                            (“The Alexandrea”),\n                        specifically referred toThe River Rimaanalysis on the first kind of contract and accepted it as\n                    correct; (b)     In my\n                        reading,The Bass Reeferand subsequentlyThe Turakinaaccepted the distinction\n                        observed inThe River Rimaand added that the\n                        specification of the ship need not be expressly specified as between the\n                        contracting parties but could beimplied from the\n                            circumstanceswhich existedat the time of\n                            performance of the supply contract; (c)     It appears to me that the error in the\n                        Plaintiff’s arguments was that it misunderstood theThe Bass ReeferandThe\n                            Turakinato stand for the proposition that the implied\n                        identification was to be assessed at the time whenthe\n                            containers was supplied to the shipas opposed to thetime of performance of the supply\n                        contract. In my reading, it was clear inThe\n                            Bass Reeferthat the inquiry into whether there was implied\n                        identification still remained to be assessed at “the time ofperformance of the contract of\n                        supply” and the other statements by the court such as\n                        “when supply was actually made to the ship” or “was\n                        there supply to a ship” must be understood in this context. In\n                        particular, the court there stated at [38]: “His Lordship’s use of the expression “or will be\n                            specified by the time the contract comes to be performed” does\n                            not, in my respectful opinion, mean that his Lordship was laying down a\n                            requirement that there should be some express specification by the\n                            contracting parties of the identity of the shipat\n                                the time of performance of the contract of supply. Such\n                            specification could occur by way of implication from the circumstances\n                            obtaining at the time when supply was actually made to the ship,\n                            especially where the act of supplying was performed by the supplier\n                            himself and not, as in The River Rima, by the other party to the\n                            contract in exercise of an independent discretion” [emphasis added] On the facts of bothThe Bass\n                                ReeferandThe Turakina,\n                            the implied identification was assessed at the time the supply of the\n                            stevedoring and other services to the ship was performed i.e. at the\n                            time of performance of the contract to supplyservices. This is different from the Plaintiff’s\n                            case which pertains to a contract for the supply of goods (i.e.\n                            containers); (d)     No other authorities were canvassed by the Plaintiff to\n                        demonstrate that they had any legal basis for the proposition that the ship\n                        did not have to be specifiedeven at the time of\n                            performance of the contract of supplyso long asat the time of the actual supply of the goods to the ship, the\n                            ship is sufficiently identified; (e)     On the Plaintiff’s case, the 2010 CLC is a\n                        contract for the supply of containers. The key question therefore is when is\n                        thetime of performance of this contract of\n                            supply? In my view, the evidence is clear that the time of\n                        performance of the contract of supply is the point in time when the\n                        containers are supplied to and collected by the Defendant from the\n                        Plaintiff’s depots and not at the time when the collected containers\n                        are subsequently physically loaded onto any of the Defendant’s ships\n                        for various voyages during the period of their lease. The terms of the 2010\n                        CLC bear this out: (i)       Art 1.4 of the 2010 CLC (as\n                            translated by the Plaintiff) states “Delivery location: At Party\n                            A’s depots”. This indicates that the point of delivery and\n                            supply is at the Plaintiff’s depots. (ii)       This is fortified by Art 2.2 which\n                            provides that the Plaintiff would charge the leasing fee when the\n                            Defendant picked up the containers out of the Plaintiff’s depots.\n                            In other words, the Plaintiff would charge the Defendant for the lease\n                            of the containers as soon as they were picked up from its depots and not\n                            only when they were placed on the Defendant’s ships. Logic\n                            dictates the Plaintiff can only charge the leasing fee for their\n                            containers at the point when the Plaintiff has first performed its key\n                            obligation under the 2010 CLC to supply the containers to the\n                            Defendants. (f)     There was no evidence to show that there was implied\n                        identification of the“Phu Tan”under the 2010 CLC atthe time of performance of the 2010\n                            CLC. Rather, at the time the containers were supplied to the\n                        Defendant and picked up from the Plaintiff’s depots, it was recorded\n                        in the majority of the EIR and booking orders that the containers would be\n                        used on various ships (including the “Phu Tan”) belonging to\n                        the Defendant; (g)     I agree with the Defendant’s counsel that the 2010 CLC was clearly a\n                        contract of the second kind contemplated inThe River\n                            Rima, i.e. a contract for the supply of goods to a shipowner\n                        i.e. the Defendant. The evidence showed that once the containers are picked\n                        up by the Defendant, they are then put onto various ships on various voyages\n                        at the discretion of the Defendant. True it was that the 111 containers\n                        ultimately were loaded onto the Phu Tan on the ill-fated journey, but that\n                        does not change the fact that it was loaded on the Phu Tan at the discretion\n                        of the Defendant and that these same containers had in the past been loaded\n                        onto various other ships also at the discretion of the\n                    Defendant. 73     Based on the foregoing analysis, I find that\n                    the Plaintiff’s claimdoes notfall within\n                    section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A. 74     As I earlier observed, so long as jurisdiction\n                    was found under any of the limbs in section 3(1)(d), (g) or (l), it would\n                    suffice to bring the claim within the admiralty jurisdiction of the court. I\n                    have found that the Plaintiff’s claim falls within section 3(1)(d) of the\n                    HC(AJ)A and in the final analysis, I find that the admiralty jurisdiction of the\n                    court was properly and validly invoked.",

        "The Analysis": "101    I now turn to examine the parties’\n                    arguments. Underpinning the Defendant’s list of alleged material\n                    non-disclosures, misleading/false statements and documents was the\n                    Defendant’s case theory (“Case Theory”) that: (a)     although they purported to rely on\n                        section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A, the Plaintiff knew all along\n                        that they had no basis to arrest the Defendant’s vessel under sections\n                        3(1)(d) and 3(1)(g) of the HC(AJ)A and the claim was always one based on the\n                        need to satisfy the requirements ofThe River\n                            Rimaunder section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A; (b)     the Plaintiff knew that to come\n                        within section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A, they would have difficulty satisfying\n                        the requirements ofThe River\n                    Rima; (c)     the Plaintiff therefore concocted a case of false documents and misleading\n                        statements in the Arrest Affidavit to try and meet the requirements ofThe River Rimain order to induce the\n                        arrest of the ship under section 3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A;\n                    and (d)     the Plaintiff\n                        therefore deliberately avoided bringingThe River\n                            Rimato the attention of the court at the Arrest\n                        Hearing; 102    In total, the Defendants’ set out a\n                    list of 8 material matters alleged to be falsely presented and/or not disclosed\n                    for the purposes of the arrest application: (a)     the misleading and false statement\n                        in paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit (“Disclosure\n                        (a)”); (b)     the misleading and false statement in paragraph 64 of the Arrest Affidavit\n                        (“Disclosure (b)”); (c)     the false translation of Art 1.1 of the 2010 CLC\n                        (“Disclosure (c)”); (d)     the false Container Loading List from Tan Thuan Port\n                        exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit (“Disclosure\n                        (d)”); (e)     the non-disclosure of the Defendants’ time bar defence to the\n                        Plaintiffs’ claim (“Disclosure (e)”); (f)     the non-disclosure of the\n                        Defendants’force majeuredefence (“Disclosure\n                        (f)”); (g)     the non-disclosure of matters relating to the Plaintiffs’ claims\n                        under section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A and deliberate avoidance\n                        ofThe River Rimaat the Arrest Hearing\n                        (“Disclosure (g)”); (h)     the non-disclosure of the jurisdiction clause in the\n                        2010 CLC and the letter at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit\n                        (“Disclosure (h)”). The Defendants’ Case Theory – fact or fiction? 103    Before turning to address each of the\n                    alleged non-disclosures and/or misleading/false statements and documents. It\n                    would be appropriate to first address the Defendants’ Case Theory set out\n                    at [101] above. 104    I begin by noting that there was simply no\n                    evidence which could be found in the Notes of Evidence (“NE”) of\n                    the Arrest Hearing that the Plaintiffs’ counsel had made any such\n                    submissions as characterised in paragraph [101] above. As I understood the\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel’s arguments on section 3(1)(l), there was never\n                    any attempt to bring the Plaintiff’s case withinThe\n                        River Rimatest. This was also the Plaintiff’s position\n                    right from the start of the hearings for the present application. As was\n                    recorded in my NE, the following submissions were made by Plaintiffs’\n                    counsel: “Defendants accuse Plaintiffs of false translation because they try\n                        to argue that Plaintiffs required such a translation to bring the claim\n                        within s 3(1)(l) of the HCAJA we accept that the CLC does not identify any particular ship. Don’t\n                        understand why Defendant makes such an argument.Plaintiffs rely on Bass Reefer. Shows 2 things (1)\n                        don’t need to expressly specify the ship and (2) don’t need\n                        express wording in the contract that the ship will be specified by the time\n                        of performance of the contract.Only question is to look\n                            at situation at the time, implication of the\n                        circumstances. Because of this authority, no need for\n                        Plaintiffs to massage the translation to bring it into the s 3(1)(l) as my\n                        learned friend has suggested.This is authority that\n                            disagrees with River Rima, observes on authority.We have\n                        based our arrest on s 3(1)(l) which we have researched andconclude that our case is not a River Rima type caseandtherefore we do meet requirements under s\n                            3(1)(l)” [emphases added] 105    As I pointed out earlier at [70] and [72]\n                    above, the Plaintiff’s case on section 3(1)(l), HC(AJ)A was premised on an\n                    erroneous reading ofThe Bass Reefer- that it\n                    would be sufficient to identify the ship by implication, assessing the matterat the time the containers were supplied to the\n                        ship(relying on the Container Loading List to evidence this) as\n                    opposed to identifying the ship at thetime of performance of\n                        the contract of supply. 106    In the course of arguments, the\n                    Defendant’s counsel found it necessary to further allege that this was a\n                    case “where having been caught by the Defendant, the Plaintiffs are\n                    trying to pull back and claim that they are not relying on the EIRs and the\n                    booking order to fulfil “THE RIVER RIMA” test now that their\n                    fraudulent position regarding the documents have been exposed by the revelation\n                    of the Defendants”. I disagree. There is simply no evidence in the NE of\n                    the Arrest Hearing that the Plaintiff’s counsel had made any such\n                    submissions that they relied on the EIRs and the booking order to fulfil the\n                    test inThe River Rimain the first\n                place. 107    I would make one last observation on this\n                    point and it is this. The Defendant’s Case Theory is less compelling once\n                    it is appreciated that the Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim was\n                    of the character contemplated under sections 3(1)(d) of the HC(AJ)A (see my\n                    earlier analyses at [27] to [40]). That being so, the allegedmotivefor the Plaintiffs’ alleged manipulation of their\n                    facts and evidence to bring their case within the ambit of section 3(1)(l) of\n                    the HC(AJ)A is certainly questionable. 108    All things considered, the Defendant’s\n                    case theory is more fiction than fact. I turn now to address each of the\n                    allegations of non-disclosure and/or false statements and\n                documents. Disclosure (a) & (d) - misleading and false statement in\n                paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit & the Container Loading List of the Tan\n                Thuan Port authority exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit is a false\n                document 109    I address the arguments on Disclosure (a)\n                    and (d) together as they are said to be related. Disclosure (a) pertained to\n                    paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit which stated: “20.Some time in December 2010, the\n                        Plaintiffs supplied 111 containers to the Defendantspursuant to the Container Lease Contractfor carriage on\n                        board the Defendants’ vessel “Phu Tan” (the\n                            “Vessel”) at Ho Chi Minh for\n                        carriage to Hai Phong. A copy of the Container Loading List provided by the\n                        Tan Thuan Port record database evidencing the shipment of the 111 containers\n                        on board the Vessel is annexed hereto at [Tab 10]” [emphasis added] 110    The Defendant alleged that paragraph 20 was\n                    misleading and there was material non-disclosure as (i) the 111 containers had\n                    actually been supplied to the Defendantbefore December\n                        2010and not “[s]ometime in December 2010”; (ii)\n                    the bulk of the 111 containers were not supplied “pursuant to the 2010\n                    CLC” but were initially supplied to the Defendant under an earlier\n                    container leasing agreement in 2006; and (iii) there was no written agreement\n                    between the parties between 2007 and up to the execution of the 2010 CLC. The\n                    Defendant’s allegation in relation to Disclosure (d) was that the\n                    Container Loading List provided by the Tan Thuan Port record database (exhibited\n                    at Tab 10 of the Arrest Affidavit) was a false document. 111    In response, Plaintiff’s counsel\n                    submitted that (i) the 111 containers were leased to the Defendant pursuant to\n                    the 2010 CLC. The earlier 2006 lease agreement referred to by the Defendant had\n                    ended in 2007 and was therefore irrelevant; (ii) at the time of the loss, the\n                    only contract in force between the parties was the 2010 CLC; and (iii) that the\n                    Defendant had themselves informed the Plaintiffs, by their letter dated 10 March\n                    2011 (disclosed in the Arrest Affidavit), that all of the 111 containers carried\n                    on board the vessel “Phu Tan” which were leased pursuant to the\n                    2010 CLC had been lost when the “Phu Tan” sank. Plaintiff’s\n                    counsel submitted that in the circumstances, the object of paragraph 20 of the\n                    Arrest Affidavit was to state the point that the 111 containers had been leased\n                    under the 2010 CLC and were loaded on the Defendants’ vessel “PHU\n                    TAN” sometime in December 2010 when thereafter the vessel\n                sank. 112    I do not accept the Defendants’\n                    argument that there was material non-disclosure of the facts that (i) the 111\n                    containers were not leased under the 2010 CLC but under a different lease\n                    agreement in 2006, and (ii) there was no written agreement between the parties\n                    between 2007 and up to the execution of the 2010 CLC. In this regard, I find the\n                    observations of Rajah JA inThe Vasiliyat [88]\n                    and [90] instructive i.e. that the matter was to be assessed applying common\n                    sense, based onwhat is reasonable given the circumstances at\n                        the time of the arrest. I have earlier noted at [58] to [61] that\n                    on the existing evidence before me, in particular, the Defendant’s letter\n                    to the Plaintiffs dated 10 March 2011, I would accept that the 111 containers\n                    were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC. In my view, the contents of the\n                    Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter clearly show that the Defendant had\n                    informed the Plaintiff that the 111 containers which were leased under the 2010\n                    CLC were on board the “PHU TAN” and the containers were lost when\n                    the “PHU TAN” sank. In these circumstances, there was no objective\n                    basis for the Plaintiff to consider that the court at the Arrest Hearing might\n                    deem it relevant to know if the 111 containers had been leased pursuant to any\n                    agreements other than the 2010 CLC or that the Plaintiff had entered into any\n                    earlier lease agreements with the Defendants, or that there were no written\n                    agreements from 2007 to June 2010. What would have been relevant to the court at\n                    the Arrest Hearing was really the matter of whether the 111 containers were\n                    leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC which formed the basis of the Plaintiff’s\n                    claims. As to this matter, the Plaintiff had provided adequate explanation in\n                    the Arrest Affidavit, and exhibited the Defendant’s letter dated 10 March\n                    2011 (at Tab 11) in support. Indeed the NE of the Arrest Hearing show that\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel specifically referred the court to “[p]age 137\n                    of 1staffidavit” which was where the\n                    Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter was exhibited. 113    The most that could be said for the\n                    Defendant at this juncture was that, whether or not the 111 containers was\n                    leased under the 2010 CLC was a factual dispute that they had raised post-arrest\n                    and which had not been determined in their favour. It follows that it is not\n                    open to them to contend that paragraph 20 of the Arrest Affidavit was false or\n                    misleading in this respect. 114    I also find no substance in the\n                    Defendant’s argument that there was non-disclosure of the fact that the\n                    111 containers were supplied “before December 2010” and not\n                    “[s]ome time in December 2010”. Given the circumstances prevailing\n                    at the time of the arrest, in particular the Defendants’ letter to the\n                    Plaintiffs dated 10 March 2011, there was no objective basis for the Plaintiff\n                    to consider that the court at the Arrest Hearing might deem it relevant to know\n                    the dates when the 111 containers were picked up by the Defendant. What would\n                    have been relevant to the court at the Arrest Hearing was really the matter of\n                    whether the 111 containers were leased pursuant to the 2010 CLC which formed the\n                    basis of the Plaintiff’s claims and whether these were the 111 containers\n                    lost on the “Phu Tan”. Further, the words “[s]ome time in\n                    December 2010” when read in the context of paragraph 20 and 21 of the\n                    Arrest Affidavit, refers back to the material time period when the 111\n                    containers were supplied “for carriage on board the Defendants’\n                    vessel “PHU TAN” and which were lost when the “Phu\n                    Tan” sank. I accept the Plaintiff’s submission that paragraph 20\n                    was meant to state that the 111 containers was suppliedto\n                        the Defendants’ vessel “PHU TAN”sometime in\n                    December 2010 when thereafter the vessel sank. 115    As for the allegation that the Container\n                    Loading List from the Tan Thuan Port records database was false. I have earlier\n                    found otherwise (see [62] to [65] above). The most that could be said for the\n                    Defendant was that, the authenticity of the Container Loading List was a factual\n                    dispute that had not been determined in their favour and it was not open to them\n                    to contend that the Container Loading List exhibited at Tab 10 of the Arrest\n                    Affidavit was a false document so as to constitute material\n                    non-disclosure. Disclosure (b) - the misleading and false statement in paragraph 64\n                of the Arrest Affidavit 116    Disclosure (b) pertained to paragraph 64 of\n                    the Arrest Affidavit which stated: “64. On 21 February 2013 at 9:59pm, the Plaintiffs responded to\n                        state that the proof is in the “Leasing Container Agreement and the\n                        Equipment Interchange receipt (EIR)” [Tab 35]. I attach by way of\n                        example a copy of one of the many EIRs together with the booking order from\n                        VCSC requesting us to supply containers for loading on “PHU\n                        TAN” for carriage from Tan Thuan, Ho Chi Minh to Hai Phong.This shows that we supplied the container and that the\n                            Defendants received it” [emphasis added] 117    Defendant’s counsel submitted that by\n                    paragraph 64, the Plaintiff had sought to present a picture that: (a)     VCSC would request for containers\n                        by the booking order and would name the ship in the document and that the\n                        name of the ship would be found in the corresponding EIR. The two documents\n                        exhibited at Tab 35 were presented as an example of all the other booking\n                        orders and EIRs that were issued between the Plaintiffs and the\n                        Defendants; (b)     The effect was that in each case the Defendant had identified the specific\n                        ship to which the containers should be sent to as the “Phu\n                        Tan” and the Plaintiff had accepted the identification by sending the\n                        containers requested to that specific ship. 118    Defendant’s counsel then argued\n                    that: (a)     paragraph 64 was false as the\n                        booking orders and EIRs that were produced by both parties subsequently\n                        showed that there was a total of 7 different ships mentioned in these\n                        documents and not just the “PHU TAN”; (b)     the false statement at paragraph 64\n                        was designed to allow the Plaintiff’s counsel to later argue in court\n                        that even though the 2010 CLC did not refer to any particular ship,\n                        nonetheless, because all the booking orders and EIRs referred to the\n                        “PHU TAN”, therefore the “PHU TAN” was the\n                        identified vessel so as to satisfyThe River\n                            Rimatest and establish admiralty jurisdiction under section\n                        3(1)(l) of the HC(AJ)A. 119    Plaintiff’s counsel submitted in\n                    response that reading paragraph 64 of the Arrest Affidavit in context together\n                    with paragraphs 63 and 65, it was clear that the sample of the EIR and booking\n                    order was exhibited simply to show that “[the Plaintiffs] supplied the\n                    container and that the Defendants received it”. The proper context of\n                    paragraph 64 was that it referred to an email sent from the Plaintiff in\n                    response to the Defendant’s earlier email query for proof of ownership of\n                    the containers. Plaintiff’s counsel’s contended, in essence, that\n                    the Defendants’ had read paragraph 64 out of context and constructed a\n                    misconceived allegation of non-disclosure around it. 120    I agree entirely with the Plaintiff’s\n                    submissions. Read in its proper context, there is no doubt that the purpose of\n                    paragraph 64 of the Arrest Affidavit was to respond to the Defendant’s\n                    earlier email query for proof of ownership of the Containers at the relevant\n                    time. In my view, the Defendants’ theory set out at [117] to [118] above\n                    was interesting but far-fetched as: (a)     it ignored the plain words of the\n                        last sentence at paragraph 64 which read “This shows that we supplied\n                        the container and that the Defendants received\n                    it”; (b)     it\n                        ignored the clear context of paragraph 64 read together with paragraphs 63\n                        and 65 of the Arrest Affidavit; (c)     there was no evidence in the NE of the Arrest Hearing\n                        that the Plaintiff’s counsel had made any such submissions as\n                        characterised in paragraph [118(b)] above. Further, as I understood the\n                        Plaintiff’s counsel’s arguments on section 3(1)(l), there was\n                        never any attempt to bring the Plaintiff’s case withinThe River Rimatest. Rather, as I pointed out\n                        earlier at [71] to [72] above, the Plaintiff’s case was premised on an\n                        erroneous reading ofThe Bass Reefer- that it\n                        was sufficient to simply identify the ship at the time ofsupply of the containers to the ship(relying on the\n                        Container Loading List (Tab 10, Arrest Affidavit) to evidence this) as\n                        opposed to identifying the ship at thetime of\n                            performance of the contract of supply. Disclosure (c) – the false translation of the 2010\n                CLC 121    I have dealt with the Defendant’s\n                    contentions on this point earlier at [53] to [56] above. For the reasons set out\n                    at [56], I found this allegation to be without substance and accepted that the\n                    Plaintiff’s translation was authentic. The most that could be said for the\n                    Defendant was that they have, post-arrest, raised a factual dispute on the\n                    translated wordings of the 2010 CLC. It is not open for them to argue that the\n                    translation of the 2010 CLC exhibited in the Arrest Affidavit was false as this\n                    factual dispute had not been determined in their favour. Disclosures (e) & (f) - non-disclosure of the time bar defence\n                & the force majeure defence 122    It is useful to recapitulate at this\n                    juncture the analysis on the extent of disclosure required in respect of\n                    “plausible defences”:The Eagle\n                        Prestigeat [72] - [75], [84]. The duty to disclose\n                    “plausible defences” was not generally directed at defences on the\n                    merits that may be raised at the trial but referred to matters, which if omitted\n                    from disclosure, would be tantamount to an abuse of the arrest process. This was\n                    the position so long as it cannot be said that the action is an abuse of\n                    process, or that it is obviously frivolous and vexatious so as to be open to\n                    summary dismissal.Once this tipping point exists,\n                    there would bematters of such weight as to deliver the\n                        “knock-out blow” to the claim summarilyand their\n                    omission is likely to or may mislead the court in the exercise of its\n                    discretionary powers of arrest. 123    The starting point here is that in the\n                    present action, the Plaintiff’s claim wasnotobviously unsustainable and is not one which could be struck\n                    out or “knocked-out” summarily on the basis of the\n                    Defendants’ time bar defence (see my earlier analysis at [79] to [86]\n                    above). It follows that the omission to disclose the plausible time bar defence\n                    or matters overlapping with the plausible time bar defence doesnotequate to an abuse of the arrest process which may\n                    justify setting aside an arrest. 124    As I understand it, Defendant’s\n                    counsel sought to contend that a time bar defence, by its very nature, would be\n                    considered aspotentiallya “knock - out\n                    blow” defence and should therefore have been disclosed. There appears to\n                    be some attraction to this submission at first blush. However, in my view,\n                    adopting the analysis inThe Eagle Prestige, in\n                    the context of alleged non-disclosure, “plausible defences” should\n                    be understood as matters (factual and/or legal) of such weight as to deliver the\n                    “knock-out blow” to the claim summarily and not merely a defence\n                    to the claim whichby their naturewouldpotentiallydeliver a “knock out” blow to\n                    the claim. Adopting the approach of Defendant’s counsel may bring the\n                    court closer to an impermissible exercise of undertaking an assessment of the\n                    merits and sustainability of a plaintiff’s action at the stage of the\n                    arrest hearing. In this regard, the guidance laid down by the Court of Appeal inThe Bunga Melati 5(at [117]) is apposite and\n                    it is this: (a)     at the arrest hearing, the court\n                        acts as a “gatekeeper” against a “completely\n                        unmeritorious claim”; (b)     a warrant to arrest may be refused if the\n                        plaintiff’s claim is supported by “obviously insufficient or\n                        contradictorydocumentaryevidence”\n                        (“emphasis added”); (c)     it is not the role of the court at the arrest stage to\n                        determine the sustainability of the plaintiff’s action, and leave\n                        should be refused only in “plain cases of processoral\n                        abuse”. 125    Ultimately, the Defendant did not point to\n                    any circumstances which demonstrated that the non-disclosure of the potential\n                    time bar defence amounted to an abuse of process. There was, for example, no\n                    allegation or evidence to show that the Defendant had communicated to the\n                    Plaintiff that they relied on the time bar defence. I have earlier concluded\n                    that there is a legitimate dispute of fact whether or not the Plaintiff’s\n                    claim is time-barred under Vietnamese law. At this juncture, the most that can\n                    be said for the Defendant is that this remains a point of controversy.\n                    Accordingly, the time bar defence is not a “plausible defence”\n                    which if not disclosed would amount to an abuse of process and justify setting\n                    aside the arrest. 126    For completeness, I note that had I\n                    concluded otherwise that there was material non-disclosure of the time bar\n                    defence, I would still not have exercised my discretion to set aside the arrest\n                    because I would have regarded such a step as a disproportionate response to the\n                    omission. In this regard, the courts apply the principle of proportionality to\n                    assess the sin of omission against the impact of such default:The Vasiliyat [84]. Based on the evidence before me and\n                    the circumstances in which the arrest was made, I would not think there was any\n                    deliberate suppression of the time bar defence on the part of the Plaintiff.\n                    There was no allegation or evidence to show that the Defendant had communicated\n                    to the Plaintiff that they relied on the time bar defence. Further, I would not\n                    think that the impact of the default was so significant as I have noted earlier\n                    that there exists in the present action a legitimate dispute of fact as to\n                    whether or not the Plaintiff’s claim is time barred under Vietnamese\n                    law. 127    The Defendant’s arguments that there\n                    was non-disclosure of theforce majeuredefence go\n                    this way. They contend that it was clear “since day one” that theforce majeuredefence was a live issue and\n                    referred to the Defendant’s 10 March 2011 letter to support this argument.\n                    Defendant’s counsel pointed to the following statement found in the\n                    letter: “As you are well aware, MV “Phu Tan” encountered the\n                        very heavy weather and sank with all containers onboard on 16 December 2919\n                        in Tonkin Gulf although our crewmembers tried their best to take all\n                        possible necessary and admissible measures to remedy. As a consequence of\n                        this sinking incident, your containers listed below are a total\n                        loss…” I am unable to agree with Defendant’s counsel’s\n                    submissions which were premised on a rather strained construction of the letter.\n                    Read as a whole, the letter certainly did not clearly indicate that the\n                    Defendant intended to rely on aforce majeuredefence. The last paragraph of the same letter makes it clear that the Defendant\n                    had informed the Plaintiff that they were still waiting for the competent\n                    authority to issue the investigation conclusion onthe\n                        causeof the sinking incident: “We will consider and settle termination and liquidation of lost\n                        containers upon the receipt of a final investigation conclusion issued by\n                        the competent authority onthe causeof\n                        sinking incident and in accordance with the existing provisions of Vietnam\n                        laws”. [emphasis added] 128    Further, I have earlier found (at paragraph\n                    [28]), based on the Investigation Conclusion issued by the Hai Phong Port\n                    authority that the sinking of the ship (and consequently the loss of the\n                    containers) was attributable to those engaged in the navigation or management of\n                    the ship. At this juncture, the most that can be said for the Defendant is that\n                    they have raised theforce majeuredefence as a\n                    point of dispute which has not been determined in their favour. I also note that\n                    the Defendant had not sought to rely on theforce\n                        majeuredefence for the purposes of their striking out\n                    application. In my view, theforce majeuredefence\n                    is not a “plausible defence” which if not disclosed would amount\n                    to an abuse of process and justify setting aside the arrest. Disclosure (g) - non - disclosure of matters relating to the\n                Plaintiffs’ claims under section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A and\n                deliberate avoidance of The River Rima at the Arrest Hearing 129    The Defendant submitted that there was\n                    material non-disclosure of matters relating to the Plaintiffs’ claims\n                    under section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l) of the HC(AJ)A. The non-disclosures\n                    essentially relate to matters of law or legal principles which the\n                    Defendant’s submitted were such settled principles and so integral to the\n                    court’s assessment of whether or not the jurisdictional limbs could be\n                    invoked that they ought to have been disclosed at the Arrest Hearing: (a)     In relation to section 3(1)(d), the\n                        Defendant’s complaint was that the Plaintiff did not disclose to the\n                        court that the section “was not for claims against the carrying\n                        ship” and that “[they] did not think anyone can credibly claim\n                        that they did not know s 3(1)(d) does not apply to claims against carrying\n                        ship”; (b)     In relation to section 3(1)(g), it was alleged that the “AR was not\n                        advised that s 3(1)(g) was for cargo claims and that the containers were not\n                        cargo but claimed as equipment”; (c)     In relation to section 3(1)(l), the heart of\n                        the complaint was that the Plaintiffs had not referred the court toThe River Rimawhich was the leading\n                        case. I would note here that the above allegations of material\n                            non-disclosure were also made in the context of the Defendants’\n                            Case Theory (which I have rejected at [103] to [108]\n                        above) 130    I will first address the complaints in\n                    relation to sections 3(1)(d). I have earlier found (at [27] to [40] that the\n                    Plaintiff had an arguable case that their claim was of the type and nature\n                    contemplated under section 3(1)(d). The Defendant’s complaints of\n                    non-disclosure however appear to be premised on their perception (which I have\n                    disagreed with) that the Plaintiff did not have any arguable case that their\n                    claims were of the type and nature to fall within sections 3(1)(d). In relation\n                    to section 3(1)(d), Plaintiff’s counsel relied on Australian and New\n                    Zealand authorities to show that they had an arguable case that their claim came\n                    within the ambit of this jurisdictional limb. I also earlier noted (at [38])\n                    that the learned author in the authoritative local textbookAdmiralty Law and Practiceexpressly recognised that there was\n                    differing authority on the scope of section 3(1)(d). In these circumstances, it\n                    could not be said that the alleged non-disclosure that this jurisdictional limb\n                    “was not for claims against the carrying ship” amounted to\n                    material non-disclosure; 131    In relation to section 3(1)(g), it was clear\n                    from the NE of the Arrest Hearing that the court was in fact referred to the\n                    “issue regarding whether containers amount to “goods”\n                    within the meaning of the limb. The NE recorded that the court was in fact\n                    referred to the case ofThe Mezenand that the\n                    Plaintiff in arguing their case, submitted to the court that the\n                    “[c]ontainers were being transported from one place to another”.\n                    Significantly, the NE also further recorded that in submitting to the court on\n                    section 3(1)(l), Plaintiff’s counsel stated “Section 3(1)(l)if containers are not cargobecause the\n                    containers were for the operation of the ship which was a container ship”\n                    [emphasis added]. It is reasonably clear therefore that the issue of whether the\n                    containers were cargo within the meaning of section 3(1)(g) was in fact\n                    disclosed and brought to the court’s attention. There is therefore no\n                    substance in the Defendant’s complaint that “the court was not\n                    advised that section 3(1)(g) was for cargo claims and that the containers were\n                    not cargo but claimed as equipment” and that this amounted to material\n                    non-disclosure. 132    The Defendant’s main complaints really\n                    centred on section 3(1)(l) and the allegation that the Plaintiff had not\n                    referred the court toThe River Rimawhich was the\n                    leading case. Underpinning these complaints was the Defendant’s\n                    (untenable) Case Theory. I am unable to agree with the Defendant that there was\n                    non – disclosure ofThe River Rimaat the\n                    Arrest Hearing. My reasons are as follows: (a)     The NE of the Arrest Hearing\n                        records that the Plaintiff’s counsel brought the court’s\n                        attention to the Singapore case ofThe\n                            “Alexandrea”[2002] 1 SLR(R) 812 (“The Alexandrea”); (b)The\n                            Alexandreadiscussed the case ofThe River\n                            Rimaat [29], [30], [31], [36] and set out, in brief, at\n                        [29], theRiver Rimatest of identification of\n                        the ship which was supplied; and (c)     Plaintiffs’ counsel affirmed to the court that she\n                        had brought the court’s attention toThe River\n                            Rimain the course of her submissions onThe Alexandrea.There was no evidence to suggest this was\n                        not the case. Plaintiff’s counsel further explained that she had\n                        referred toThe Alexandreaas the comments\n                        therein, that section 3(1)(l) applied to claims in tort, were pertinent to\n                        the Plaintiff’s claim. 133    In the course of the hearings, the\n                    Defendant’s counsel sought clarification, by way of a letter, from the\n                    Assistant Registrar (“AR”) presiding over the Arrest Hearing\n                    whether or not Plaintiff’s counsel had referred the court to the case ofThe River Rima. The AR’s response was\n                    “nothing further to add to the certified notes of evidence”.\n                    Flowing from the AR’s response, the Defendant’s counsel contended\n                    that because the clarification of the AR was that there was “nothing\n                    further to add to the certified notes of evidence”, and insofar as the NE\n                    of the Arrest Hearing did not expressly record the reference to\n                        “The River Rima”, this meant\n                    that the Plaintiff’s counsel had in fact not referred the AR toThe River Rima, even though she claimed she had. This\n                    was, by all accounts, a relatively serious accusation levelled against\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel, and one which I would dismiss as without any\n                    evidential basis. 134    To conclude on this point, I find, based on\n                    the foregoing analysis, that there is no merit in the Defendant’s\n                    submissions that there was non-disclosure in respect of matters relating to\n                    section 3(1)(d), (g) and (l). 135    Before proceeding further, for completeness,\n                    I would make the further observations on a point of law that was raised by the\n                    Plaintiff’s counsel in the course of her arguments. Plaintiff’s\n                    counsel submitted that a distinction should be made between matters of fact and\n                    “pure questions of law” as regards the test for disclosure and\n                    that a plaintiff should bear a higher burden in relation to the disclosure of\n                    facts. The argument was premised on the proposition that the court on anex parteapplication is reliant on the\n                    applicant to produce all material facts and evidence whereas in relation to\n                    “pure questions of law”, the court was better placed to make its\n                    own assessment and would not be so reliant on the applicant. Plaintiff’s\n                    counsel submitted that in cases such asThe Vasiliy, The\n                        Eagle PrestigeandThe Bunga Melati\n                        5, the courts had hitherto focused on non-disclosure ofmaterial factseither relevant to a jurisdictional issue\n                    or in support of “plausible defences” and had not dealt with\n                    disclosure of matters of pure law. 136    In my view there is no need or basis to draw\n                    such a distinction between matters of fact and “pure questions of\n                    law”. The statements found inThe Vasiliy,The Eagle PrestigeandThe\n                        Bunga Melati 5discussed the disclosure of both factual and legal\n                    matters/objections and the courts there did not express any intention to lay\n                    down different tests to govern disclosures of fact and disclosures of\n                    “pure questions of law”. As stated by the Court of Appeal inThe Vasiliy, the test of materiality: 87. …embraces mattersboth factual and\n                            legal, which may be prejudicial or disadvantageous to the\n                        successful outcome of the applicant’s application. It extends to all\n                        material facts that could be reasonably ascertained and defences that might\n                        be reasonably raised by the defendant. [emphasis added] 137    The Court of Appeal inThe Bunga Melati 5(at [116]) issued the salutary reminder that\n                    our courts ultimately seek to strike the balance between the twin policy\n                    concerns of allowing a liberal invoking of the admiralty jurisdiction andpreventing the abuse of the ship arrest\n                        process. Whether or not there was material non-disclosure in the\n                    circumstances is ultimately to be assessed with reference to the question of\n                    whether the alleged non-disclosure amounted toan abuse of\n                        the arrest process. The (common)sensible guidance inThe Vasiliy(at [90]) is that the scope of disclosure\n                    should be what is reasonable in the given circumstances at the time of the\n                    arrest, assessed as a matter of common sense. 138    In my observation, whether it is a\n                    “pure question of law” or otherwise, the test of materiality would\n                    remain the same. In the context of disclosing matters of “pure questions\n                    of law” to the court at an arrest hearing, the policy concern is whether\n                    the alleged non-disclosure is tantamount to an abuse of the arrest process. I\n                    venture to illustrate this briefly. Under the various jurisdictional limbs of\n                    the HC(AJ)A, had there been Singapore authorities whichconclusivelydetermined the ambit of these provisions, then any\n                    applicant intending to contend for an interpretation of sections 3(1)(d) or\n                    3(1)(g) which went against the grain ofconclusiveSingapore authorities would have the duty to disclose theseconclusiveSingapore authorities for the court’s\n                    consideration failing which there would be strong suggestion that such\n                    non-disclosure amounts to an abuse of process which may warrant a setting aside\n                    of the arrest. Disclosure (h) – non-disclosure of the jurisdiction clause in\n                the 2010 CLC and the letter at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit 139    I come now to the Defendant’s final\n                    allegations of non-disclosure. The Defendant argued that the jurisdiction clause\n                    in the 2010 CLC and the letter at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit were not\n                    disclosed to the court at the Arrest Hearing. However, the evidence indicates\n                    otherwise. The NE of the Arrest Hearing records: “PC: …Page 137 of 1staffidavit\n                        is a document showing that 111 containers belonging to the Plaintiff were\n                        lost. [Goes through paragraphs 4 to 99 of 1staffidavit and exhibits]” 140    It is clear from the record that the letter\n                    at page 137 of the Arrest Affidavit was in fact disclosed and referred to the\n                    courtspecifically. As for the jurisdiction clause\n                    at Art 6 of the 2010 CLC, this was set out in the text of the Arrest Affidavit\n                    at paragraph 12 under a section listing out the relevant terms of the 2010 CLC.\n                    It was recorded in the NE that the Plaintiffs’ counsel (i.e.\n                    “PC”) went through paragraphs 4 to 99 with the court. Evidently\n                    this exercise would have included taking the court through paragraph 12 of the\n                    Arrest Affidavit. In short, there is no factual basis for the Defendant to\n                    allege non-disclosure of these matters.",
        "Issue 3: Was there material non-disclosure by the Plaintiffs in the\n                Arrest Affidavit and at the Arrest Hearing so as to justify setting aside the\n                admiralty writ": "93     I turn now to the Defendant’s final\n                    string in its legal bow. The Defendant’s counsel argued that the arrest\n                    should be set aside on the basis of material non-disclosure by the Plaintiffs\n                    both in the Arrest Affidavit as well as at the Arrest Hearing. By my count,\n                    Defendant’s counsel set out a list of 8 alleged non-disclosures and\n                    misleading/false statements and documents. I go first to the law.",
        "Conclusion": "141    For all the foregoing reasons, the\n                    Defendant’s application is dismissed. I will hear parties on\n                costs."
