        "Facts": "2 The appellant, Teo Kian Leong, had initially faced a total of 11\n\ncharges under s 102(b) of the Securities Industry Act (Cap 289) for engaging in acts\n\nconnected with the purchase and sale of securities, which operated as a deceit on another\n\nperson. These 11 charges related to 11 different individuals, and each of these 11 charges\n\nrelated to a number of share transactions. On 1 November 2000, the prosecution proceeded\n\non eight of these 11 charges while the remaining three charges were stood down. The\n\nappellant, who claimed trial to the eight charges, was convicted of all eight charges at\n\nthe conclusion of the trial. He was sentenced to serve six months’ imprisonment for\n\neach of the eight charges. The trial judge ordered two of the sentences of imprisonment to\n\nrun consecutively with the remaining sentences to run concurrently, making the total term\n\nof imprisonment 12 months. The appellant’s conviction and sentence relating to the\n\neight charges was subsequently affirmed by this court when brought up on appeal before me\n\ninTeo Kian Leong v PP[2002] 1 SLR 147.3 As a result of the appellant’s representations to the\n\nAttorney-General’s Chambers, the prosecution agreed to proceed on only one of the\n\nthree remaining charges and applied for the other two charges to be taken into\n\nconsideration for the purposes of sentencing. On 9 November 2001, the appellant pleaded\n\nguilty to the said charge and was sentenced to serve six months’ imprisonment which\n\nthe trial judge ordered to commence at the expiration of his existing 12-month sentence\n\nbringing the cumulative term of imprisonment to 18 months.",
        "The Appeal": "4 While counsel accepts that the six month term of imprisonment is\n\nperfectly appropriate, he contends that the trial judge had erred in the exercise of his\n\njudicial discretion when ordering the said sentence to commence at the expiration of the\n\nappellant’s current sentence instead of immediately. This resulted in a cumulative\n\nsentence of 18 months which is manifestly excessive and wholly disproportionate to the\n\nfacts of the case and the severity of the offences.5 The sentencing discretion of the Singapore courts in respect of\n\nimposing a subsequent sentence on an accused who is currently serving a term of\n\nimprisonment is governed by s 234(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68), which reads:Where a person who is an escaped convict or is undergoing a sentence of\n\n  imprisonment is sentenced to imprisonment the latter sentence of imprisonmentshallcommenceeitherimmediatelyorat the expiration of the imprisonment to\n\n  which he was previously sentenced as the court awarding the sentence directs. [Emphasis\n\n  added]6 It was held in the case ofPeter Tham Wing Fai v PP[1989] 2MLJ 404 that this discretion should be exercised \"judiciously\". In that case,\n\nChao JC (as he then was) refused to order the one year term of imprisonment for criminal\n\nbreach of trust to commence on the date of conviction and ordered that it run consecutive\n\nto the eight year term of imprisonment for 36 forgery charges which the accused was then\n\nserving. He took up counsel’s invitation to put himself in the shoes of the trial\n\njudge and considered whether the trial judge would have ordered the one year term of\n\nimprisonment to run consecutive to the eight year term, if the charge for criminal breach\n\nof trust was dealt together with the earlier 36 charges for forgery. Chao JC found that,\n\nhaving regard to the circumstances as a whole, there was more than an even chance that the\n\ntrial judge might have ordered the one year term of imprisonment to run consecutive to the\n\n8-year term. Chao JC also distinguished the case ofR v Ames, R v Carey[1938] 1 ALL ER 515, on the ground that the subsequent charge in that case was similar to the\n\nearlier charge which was not so in the case before him.7 To my mind, the court’s judicious exercise of its sentencing\n\ndiscretion in relation to s 234(1) would necessarily involve having regard to the common\n\nlaw principles of sentencing applicable to the imposition of consecutive sentences. These\n\ncommon law principles are namely, the one transaction rule and the totality principle\n\nwhich have been adopted by the Court of Appeal inKanagasuntharam v PP[1992] 1 SLR 81and applied in numerous other local decisions. A sentencing judge, when deciding\n\nwhether to order a subsequent term of imprisonment to run immediately or at the expiration\n\nof an existing term of imprisonment imposed on an earlier occasion, should therefore have\n\nregard to whether the subsequent offence arose in the \"same transaction\" as the\n\nearlier offence(s), and also to the totality of the sentence to be served (seeMohd\n\nAkhar Hussain v Assistant Collector of CustomsA.I.R 1988 S.C 2143). Of course, the\n\napplication of the one transaction rule is subject to s 234(1) which only extends the\n\ncourt’s sentencing discretion to ordering the subsequent sentence to commence\n\nimmediately.8 However, one must bear in mind that the common law principles are\n\nreally there to guide the sentencing courts, whose primary duty is to determine the\n\nappropriate sentence which would best ensure that the ends of justice are met. No single\n\nconsideration can conclusively determine the proper sentence and, in arriving at the\n\nproper sentence, the court must balance many factors, sometimes rejecting some. One factor\n\nthat the court should consider is whether the totality of the sentence to be served is\n\nproportional to the inherent gravity of all the offences committed by the accused. Hence,\n\nwhile the individual sentence for a particular offence may be perfectly appropriate, the\n\ncumulative effect of the sentences may result in a total term of imprisonment that is\n\ndisproportionate to the overall criminality of the accused. In contemplating the totality\n\nof the sentences which the accused has to undergo, a question that the presiding judge can\n\nconsider is : If all the offences had been before him, would he still have passed a\n\nsentence of similar length? If not, the judge should adjust the sentence to be imposed for\n\nthe latest offence in the light of the aggregate sentence : seeMillen(1980) 2 Cr\n\nApp R (S) 357 andWatts(2000) 1 Cr App R (S) 460. Whether this is done by imposing\n\na shorter sentence to run consecutively or a longer sentence to commence immediately, does\n\nnot at the end of the day make much difference, although in principle, the judge should as\n\nfar as possible try to impose a sentence that is reflective of the gravity of the latest\n\noffence(s) in question.9 Returning to the facts of the present case, I was satisfied that,\n\ngiven the aggravating factors of the case, a total sentence of 18 months was not\n\ndisproportionate to the gravity of his offences. Admittedly, although the total amount of\n\nloss for all 11 charges (approximately $500 000) caused by the appellant would pale in\n\ncomparison toPP v Hew Keong Chan(approximately $1.74m, sentenced to 12\n\nmonths’ imprisonment) andSyn Yong Sing David v PP(approximately $ 1.3m,\n\nsentenced to four months’ imprisonment), I found that the aggravating factors in this\n\ncase far outweighed the factor relating to the amount of loss.10 In fact, I had already dealt with these aggravating factors as well\n\nas the case ofPP v Hew Chong Chan(DAC 21810-6/99)andSyn Yong Sing\n\nDavid(MA 226/98/01) in my decision inTeo Kian Leong v PP(above). However, to\n\nrecapitulate, the appellant abused the trust reposed in him by 11 different individuals.\n\nThis is no small number. Furthermore, unlike the persons involved in the above two cases\n\ncited, these 11 individuals had no knowledge and did not authorise the appellant to use\n\ntheir accounts for his own benefit. The entire scheme to deceive and profit from his 11\n\nclients and later escape responsibility was orchestrated solely on the appellant’s\n\nown accord. Not only did the appellant repeatedly assure his clients, who questioned him\n\nabout these additional transactions in their account, that they were \"mistakes\"\n\nwhich he would rectify, he boldly continued to carry on with similar transactions and\n\naccumulated even greater losses at the expense of his clients.11 In light of the aggravating circumstances of this case, allowing the\n\nappellant’s second term of imprisonment to commence on the date it was ordered would\n\nhave the effect of make his total term of imprisonment only 12 months. This, in my\n\nopinion, was not only wholly disproportionate to the criminality of the appellant but\n\nserved to reduce the gravity of his crime, making it an ineffective deterrence for\n\nlike-minded individuals. Therefore, based on the foregoing reasons, I dismissed the\n\nappeal.Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWChief JusticeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
