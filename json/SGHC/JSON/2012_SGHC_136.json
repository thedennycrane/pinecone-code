        "Introduction": "1       This is a case where eSys Technologies Pte Ltd\n                    (“the plaintiff”) should have adhered to the adage “let\n                    sleeping dogs lie” instead of suing nTan Corporate Advisory Pte Ltd\n                    (“the defendant”) for,inter alia,\n                    the refund of the balance of the deposit of S$2m (“the Deposit”)\n                    that it paid to the defendant for the latter’s consultancy services. Its\n                    filing of this suit prompted the defendant to file a counterclaim against the\n                    plaintiff for a sum far in excess of the balance of the Deposit.",
        "The parties": "2       The plaintiff is a company which was founded and\n                    incorporated in 2000 by Vikas Goel (“Vikas”). At the material time\n                    in November 2006, the plaintiff was in the business of distributing computer\n                    hardware. As of October and November 2006, the plaintiff had several worldwide\n                    distribution agreements with Seagate Technology (“Seagate”).\n                    Seagate is and was at all material times a multinational corporation based in\n                    the United States which designs, manufactures and markets the Seagate and Maxtor\n                    brands of hard disk drives. It is not disputed that the distributorship\n                    agreements with Seagate were significant to the plaintiff as 40% of the\n                    plaintiff’s sales comprised of Seagate and Maxtor products and that 40% of\n                    the plaintiff’s receivables were derived from the same. 3       The defendant is a Singapore company. The\n                    defendant is and was at all material times engaged in business and management\n                    consultancy services, as well as corporate finance and restructuring services.\n                    Its chief executive officer is and was at all material times, Nicky Tan\n                    (“Nicky”). Prior to setting up the defendant, Nicky was the Head\n                    of Advisory Services at PricewaterhouseCoopers Singapore. In addition, he was\n                    also the Chairman of Financial Advisory Services of PricewaterhouseCoopers Asia\n                    Pacific, as well as the previous Head of Global Corporate Finance at Arthur\n                    Andersen for Singapore and the ASEAN region. Nicky’s curriculum vitae was\n                    testimony to his expertise in the fields of corporate restructuring and\n                    insolvency.",
        "Facts leading to the commencement of the relationship": "4       The relationship between the parties arose from\n                    events which took place in November 2006. On 6 November 2006, Seagate\n                    terminated various distributor agreements which it had with the plaintiff and\n                    its subsidiaries. In doing so, Seagate filed an announcement with the United\n                    States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC Announcement”)\n                    which stated,inter alia: Today we took steps to commence the process of terminating our distributor\n                        relationships with [the plaintiff] and we have ceased shipments of our\n                        products to [the plaintiff]. [The plaintiff] was the largest distributor of\n                        Seagate products (including Maxtor products) for the fiscal year ended June\n                        30, 2006 and for the quarter ended September 29, 2006, representing\n                        approximately 5% and 6% of our revenues for those respective periods. In early October 2006, we initiated an audit of [the plaintiff’s]\n                        point of sale records pursuant to our contractual rights to confirm the\n                        accuracy and completeness of [the plaintiff’s] claims for program\n                        credits under our distributor sales incentive programs. Discussions with\n                        [the plaintiff] surrounding the timing, scope of work, and selection of\n                        third party auditors continued until last week when [the plaintiff’s]\n                        officials informed us they would deny our third party auditors access to\n                        [the plaintiffs’] records to perform the requested audit\n                        notwithstanding our contractual rights to do so. [The plaintiff’s]\n                        officials also indicated to us that an audit would likely reveal\n                        irregularities in [the plaintiff’s] compliance with the terms of our\n                        incentive programs and other unspecified irregularities. In addition, [the\n                        plaintiff] has failed to make full current payments on its obligations to\n                        us. Accordingly, today, we notified [the plaintiff] that we are terminating\n                        our commercial distributor relationships with [the plaintiff]. 5       Then in December 2006, Seagate (and its related\n                    companies) commenced Suits No. 844 of 2006 and No 854 of 2006 against the\n                    plaintiff and Vikas respectively. (The two suits will be collectively referred\n                    to hereinafter as “the 2006 suits”.) Suit No 844 of 2006 was\n                    Seagate’s claim against the plaintiff for the then outstanding sum of more\n                    than US$4m due from the plaintiff for the supply of Seagate products. Suit No\n                    854 of 2006 was Seagate’s claim against Vikas as the guarantor of the\n                    plaintiff’s debts under a guarantee dated 8 October 2004. In October\n                    2006, this court dealt with five Registrar’s Appeals arising out of the\n                    2006 suits.",
        "The agreement between the parties": "6       The events detailed at[4]and[5]above had severe\n                    ramifications for the plaintiff. The termination of the distributorship\n                    agreements with Seagate, a significant revenue generator of the plaintiff,\n                    raised concerns in various parties who had vested interests in the plaintiff.\n                    Such concerns resulted in actions which were financially detrimental to the\n                    plaintiff. In particular, creditors and suppliers of the plaintiff cancelled\n                    credit facilities while bank creditors demanded repayment or furnishing of\n                    additional security. 7       In a bid to alleviate its dire situation, the\n                    plaintiff sought legal advice from its solicitors, Drew & Napier LLC, whose\n                    S Nair (“Nair”) recommended that the defendant be engaged as an\n                    adviser. Nair then arranged a meeting with Nicky on 11 November 2006 on an\n                    urgent basis. On 14 November 2006, the plaintiff and defendant signed a\n                    letter of engagement (“the Engagement Letter”). 8       As the Engagement Letter is central to the\n                    dispute between the parties, its salient terms are reproduced\n                below. 9       The main reason for appointing the defendant was\n                    stated in the Engagement letter (“the Appointment Clause”) as\n                    follows: APPOINTMENT OF INDEPENDENT\n                            ADVISOR Allegations of irregularities in a distribution deal between [the\n                        plaintiff] and [Seagate] was made by Seagate in a filing on 6 November\n                        2006 with the United States Securities Exchange Commission (“the\n                        Allegations”) by Seagate. The Allegations may result in litigation\n                        (“Potential Litigation”). 10     The scope of the defendant’s employment\n                    was stated in the Engagement Letter (“Scope of Work Clause”) as\n                    follows: Scope of\n                        work The board of directors of [the plaintiff] (“Board of\n                        Directors”) has resolved to and appointed [the defendant] as\n                        independent advisor to [the plaintiff] and its subsidiary and associate\n                        companies (together, the “Group”) to: (i)review all matters which are the subject of the\n                            Allegations and such other related transactions arising from or\n                            connected thereto; (ii)advise and assist the Group in reviewing and\n                            developing strategic options with the objective of enhancing value to\n                            all stakeholders; (iii)advise and assist the Group, as appropriate, on\n                            suitable options to restructure its operational activities and financial\n                            arrangements; (iv)advise and assist the Group on acquisitions and\n                            strategic alliances with the objective of enhancing stakeholder\n                            value; (v)advise and assist the Group in identifying and\n                            securing potential investors; (vi)advise and assist the Group in engaging and\n                            instructing relevant professionals, such as accounting, legal and tax\n                            who are experts as needed in the circumstances; (vii)assist lawyers and other professionals who have\n                            been and may be appointed by [the plaintiff] in connection with the\n                            Allegations and Potential Litigation; and (viii)review such other matters, transactions and\n                            affairs as may be agreed between the Board of Directors and [the\n                            defendant]. 11     The Engagement Letter provided that two types\n                    of fees were liable to be paid by the plaintiff to the defendant. The first type\n                    of fees comprised of,inter alia, time costs and\n                    out-of-pocket expenses. This was stated in the Engagement Letter as follows\n                    (“the Fees Clause”): [The defendant’s] fees for the engagement comprise our time costs\n                        fee, out-of pocket expenses (including fees of any experts or professionals)\n                        and such other fees as may be provided for in any addendum to this letter.\n                        [The defendant] will raise monthly progress billings (“Monthly\n                        Progress Billings”) based on our time costs and other fees and\n                        expenses. [The defendant’s] charge out rates and other charges and\n                        expenses, are set out in the attached schedule. 12     The schedule (“the Fees\n                    Schedule”) to the Engagement Letter, referred to in the Fees Clause (at[11]above) essentially detailed the\n                    hourly charge-out rates of personnel of the defendant, which was based upon\n                    seniority. The rates ranged from US$100 per hour for an associate, to US$1,000\n                    per hour for Nicky. 13     The second type of fees were value-added fees\n                    (“VAF”), which were contingent upon the defendant performing\n                    certain types of work which resulted in value being added to the plaintiff. This\n                    was stated in the Engagement Letter as follows (“VAF\n                    Clause”): Upon the successful completion of any of the above foregoing scope of work\n                        (“Successful Completion”), a Value-Added Fee\n                        (“VAF”) computed at 5% of Total Gross Value Added\n                        (“TGVA”), shall be payable by [the plaintiff] to [the\n                        defendant]. TGVA is the sum total of the following: a)Value of the Group’s liabilities written off,\n                            extinguished, avoided or restructured; b)Fair value of new assets injected and recovered by\n                            the Group; c)Value of new equity and/or debt raised by the\n                            Group; and d)Any other value add agreed with [the plaintiff] and\n                            the Group. 14     The Engagement Letter also provided that the\n                    plaintiff pay the Deposit upon execution. The plaintiff duly paid the Deposit,\n                    and as noted above at[1], brought the\n                    present suit to claim the refund of the balance of the Deposit. 15     Clause 8 of Appendix A to the Engagement\n                    Letter provided for termination and reads: Termination It is understood that the services to be provided by [the defendant] under\n                        this letter may be terminated by either of us at any time by written notice\n                        to the other without liability or continuing obligation to either of us\n                        except that the provisions relating to fees incurred up to the date of\n                        termination and confirmations and further undertakings will continue in\n                        force and remain operative. For the avoidance of doubt, after the termination of this engagement, [the\n                        defendant] will continue to be entitled to the fees and out-of-pocket\n                        expenses already incurred up to the date of termination in accordance with\n                        this letter and any other fees that may be provided for in any addendum to\n                        this letter. For the avoidance of doubt, after the termination of our engagement, [the\n                        defendant] will also continue to be entitled to the VAF described herein, if\n                        [the plaintiff] and the Group adopt and implement our advice relating to the\n                        scope of work contained in this Letter within 36 months from the date of\n                        termination.",
        "The termination of the defendant’s engagement": "16     After the Engagement Letter was executed, the\n                    defendant carried out work for the plaintiff. The precise nature of the work\n                    done by the defendant, as well as its efficacy, was hotly disputed by the\n                    parties and is discussed at length below. The defendant rendered two invoices\n                    (collectively “the two invoices”) to the plaintiff for time costs\n                    and out-of-pocket expenses on 4 and 6 February, 2007 for the sums of\n                    S$663,759.64 and S$69,680.15 respectively. The plaintiff terminated the\n                    defendant’s engagement on the day that the second invoice was\n                    rendered.",
        "The pleadings": "",
        "The claim and defence to counterclaim": "17     The plaintiff sought an account of the fees\n                    and expenses from the defendant pursuant to the above two invoices (“an\n                    Account”). Further, the plaintiff claimed the sum of S$1,266,560.21 which\n                    represented the balance of the Deposit after allowing for deduction of the\n                    amounts in the two invoices (at[16]above).\n                    The plaintiff contended that it was an implied term of the Engagement Letter\n                    that the defendant must furnish an Account. As a corollary to this contention,\n                    the plaintiff argued that the two invoices and their contents did not suffice as\n                    an Account. 18     In respect of the defendant’s\n                    counterclaim (see [20]),\n                    the plaintiff asserted that the defendant was not entitled to any\n                VAF.",
        "The defence and counterclaim": "19     In its defence to the claim for an Account,\n                    the defendant contended that the plaintiff’s claim for an Account was\n                    neither genuine norbona fide. The defendant also\n                    contended, in the alternative, that there had to be implied a term that any\n                    Account sought by the plaintiff had to be obtained within a reasonable\n                    time. 20     By way of a counterclaim, the defendant sought\n                    a declaration that it was entitled to an additional fee from the plaintiff\n                    pursuant to the VAF Clause (at[13]above).\n                    The defendant further contended that it was entitled to VAF far in excess of the\n                    balance of the Deposit and that pursuant to the terms of the Engagement Letter,\n                    it was not liable to refund any portion of the Deposit under the\n                    circumstances.",
        "The plaintiff’s claim for an Account": "",
        "The plaintiff’s case": "Was VAF payable on restructured bank liabilities? 58     The plaintiff contended that the\n                    “informal standstill” (at [44]) did not entitle the\n                    defendant to claim 5% of TGVA as VAF under the VAF clause (at [13]) even though the plaintiff\n                    did not dispute that the “informal standstill” was instrumental in\n                    facilitating the plaintiff’s eventual repayment of its liabilities. The\n                    plaintiff contended that the omission of any reference to a “standstill\n                    agreement” in the Engagement Letter meant that the parties did not intend\n                    for any VAF to be payable upon occurrence of such events. In particular, the\n                    plaintiff contended that the bank liabilities were not\n                    “restructured” because “standstill agreements”\n                    merely involve creditors withholding or refraining from enforcing their existing\n                    rights, and do not result in the alteration of the creditors’ rights as a\n                    result of which the plaintiff enjoyed a benefit. Was VAF payable on the Teledata deal? 59     The plaintiff’s defence to this aspect\n                    of the counterclaim was twofold. First, that the defendant did not perform\n                    substantial work in relation to the deal involving Teledata. Second, that\n                    Teledata did not invest in the plaintiff but in Rainforest. 60     Vikas averred that the defendant was not\n                    involved at all in the investment involving Teledata. The relevant portions of\n                    his affidavit of evidence–in-chief (“AEIC”) read: (a)     the defendant did not render any\n                        advice and/or assistance to the plaintiff in relation to the transaction\n                        with Teledata; (b)     the structure of the intended transaction with Teledata was based on and\n                        formulated from discussions between representatives of Teledata and Vikas.\n                        The defendant did not render any advice orally or otherwise to Vikas or to\n                        the plaintiff in relation to such structure. 61     Vikas further averred that while the defendant\n                    was kept informed of the negotiations between the plaintiff and Teledata, this\n                    was only because it was part of the defendant’s scope of work to procure\n                    new investors, and also because the plaintiff was hopeful that the defendant\n                    could have procured a better offer than that proposed by Teledata.",
        "The defendant’s case": "VAF was payable on restructured bank liabilities 39     The defendant’s case was that it\n                    successfully restructured the plaintiff’s liabilitiesvis-à-visthe bank creditors. As such, it was entitled to VAF\n                    amounting to 5% of such liabilities. In this regard, the defendant’s main\n                    contention was that it had successfully secured agreement from the bank\n                    creditors to stave off their demands, thereby enabling the plaintiff to\n                    eventually repay its debts. 40     Nicky advised the plaintiff that in order to\n                    convince the bank creditors that it was in their best interests to accord more\n                    time for repayment, the plaintiff had to create a “virtuous”, as\n                    opposed to a “vicious” cycle. In the former situation, all\n                    creditors would be treated equally and no creditor would be preferred over\n                    others. As a result, the plaintiff would secure the bank creditors’\n                    agreement not to enforce their claims immediately, thereby allowing the\n                    plaintiff to fully realise its assets and pay off its liabilities thereafter. In\n                    the “vicious” cycle, some creditors would be paid in preference to\n                    others thereby creating impetus for other creditors to enforce their claims\n                    against the plaintiff immediately to the detriment of the plaintiff. Towards\n                    this end, Nicky informed Vikas that a meeting with the bank creditors had to be\n                    convened. In addition, Nicky told Vikas that at such a meeting, the plaintiff\n                    should do the following: (a)     Present the most up to date\n                        operational and financial information pertaining to the\n                    plaintiff; (b)     Provide\n                        updates on all relevant matters which included the ramifications pertaining\n                        to the SEC Announcement; (c)     Assuage the bank creditors’ concerns;\n                    and (d)     Persuade the\n                        bank creditors to agree to a standstill agreement. 41     Vikas agreed to the plan suggested by Nicky\n                    and decided that the plaintiff should proceed to arrange a meeting with the bank\n                    creditors. The work done by the defendant, in the run up to the bank creditors\n                    meeting, was not disputed at the trial. The defendant prepared the presentation\n                    which was used during the bank creditors meeting which was eventually held on\n                    24 November 2006 (“the Meeting”). The presentation detailed\n                    the most updated financial position of the plaintiff and provided information of\n                    the continued viability of the plaintiff. The decision to provide updated\n                    financial information pertaining to the plaintiff was a strategic one taken by\n                    Nicky. Prior to the Meeting, several of the bank creditors were of the view that\n                    the plaintiff had not been transparent in furnishing information pertaining to\n                    its financial position. In a bid to reverse the situation, the defendant decided\n                    to provide the bank creditors with updated financial figures. Hence, the\n                    defendant requested for the plaintiff’s management accounts to be updated\n                    to 18 November 2006. Nicky explained during cross-examination that by doing\n                    so, the defendant sought to demonstrate to the bank creditors that the plaintiff\n                    was going to be transparent henceforth: Nicky: ... The fact that we produced numbers up to 18 November, to\n                        show the banks “Look, forget about the past complaint about lack of\n                        transparency; we are now – this is a new regime. We are giving you\n                        numbers up to three – five days, seven days before you come to the\n                        meeting. This is the key. You hear – you see all the letters from the bank\n                        complaining, “You are not transparent, I can’t meet you, I\n                        can’t get any information from you.” One of the key things that\n                        I was desperate to show to the bank, within two weeks of our appointment, we\n                        got you the latest number. We got you the number as of 18 November. No\n                        company produced such things. The key thing about steadying a ship when you are insolvent or you are\n                        unable to pay the bank, what they need is clear, transparent information.\n                        They don’t mind dealing with bad news; they don’t like to deal\n                        with uncertainties. So you have to give clear, transparent information, so\n                        they know what the situation is. 42     Before the Meeting was convened, Nicky also\n                    convinced the plaintiff that it should offer to appoint PricewaterhouseCoopers\n                    as the bank creditors’ financial adviser. In Nicky’s view, such a\n                    move would boost the bank creditors’ confidence in the\n                plaintiff. 43     Nicky chaired the Meeting which was attended\n                    by three of his associates and three lawyers from Drew & Napier. The Meeting\n                    was a crucial event as it represented the first opportunity, after the bank\n                    creditors had issued their demands on the plaintiff (at[36]above), for the plaintiff to convince the bank creditors to\n                    withhold their demands and agree to giving more time for the plaintiff to repay\n                    its liabilities. The minutes of the Meeting recorded that Nicky did the\n                    following: (a)     Distributed presentation slides and\n                        took the bankers through the financial information of the plaintiff\n                        contained therein; (b)     Informed the bank creditors that there were potential investors in\n                        the plaintiff; (c)     Explained to the bank creditors the nature of the plaintiff’s\n                        business in the light of which it would be in the bank creditors’ best\n                        interest to hold off their demands against the plaintiff; (d)     Informed the bank creditors that the\n                        plaintiff was formulating a repayment plan; (e)     Informed the bank creditors that no creditor was\n                        going to be paid in preference to others; and (f)     Stated that the plaintiff was prepared to file\n                        an application under s 210(10) of the Companies Act (Cap 50, 2006 Rev Ed) if\n                        necessary. 44     The Meeting concluded with representatives of\n                    the attending bank creditors agreeing to meet amongst themselves the following\n                    week. In addition, there was agreement that none of the bank creditors would\n                    commence legal proceedings against the plaintiff in the interim. Indeed, none of\n                    the bank creditors took action against the plaintiff after the Meeting and the\n                    plaintiff was able to repay all its debts by March 2007. VAF payable on the Teledata deal 45     It was the defendant’s case that it\n                    performed work in relation to an investment by Teledata Informatics Ltd\n                    (“Teledata”), of approximately US$100m in the plaintiff\n                    (“the Teledata deal”). As such, the defendant claimed that it was\n                    entitled to VAF amounting to 5% of the value of the said\n                investment. 46     Vikas told Nicky about a proposal by Teledata\n                    for a potential investment in the plaintiff at the first meeting between them on\n                    11 November 2006. The investment contemplated the injection of US$100m by\n                    Teledata into the plaintiff. In return, Teledata would obtain shares in the\n                    plaintiff. On the same day, Nicky was given the draft Letter of Intent\n                    (“draft LOI”) in respect of the said investment. Pursuant to the\n                    draft LOI, Teledata would purchase 51% of the shares in the plaintiff in\n                    consideration of US$60m. In addition, Teledata would provide a loan of US$40m to\n                    the plaintiff as working capital. 47     Nicky’s evidence was that he advised\n                    Vikas not to rush into a deal envisioned by the draft LOI, as the investment\n                    structure was far from ideal. This was because the plaintiff would, as a result\n                    of the LOI, have a pool of unencumbered cash would could rouse the bank\n                    creditors’ interest in immediate repayment. In addition, the injection of\n                    fresh funds directly into the plaintiff would give the bank creditors impetus to\n                    put the plaintiff into liquidation or judicial management. Either scenario would\n                    be detrimental to the plaintiff. 48     Instead of the investment structure envisioned\n                    by the draft LOI, Nicky advised on four types of structures to facilitate the\n                    objective of obtaining new monies to restructure the terms of repayment to the\n                    bank creditors as well as to provide working capital for the plaintiff.\n                    Nicky’s advice was eventually incorporated into five agreements which were\n                    entered into by the plaintiff with a company called Rainforest Trading Limited\n                    (“Rainforest”). The five agreements are discussed in detail at[49]–[55]below. (a)     The Holding Company\n                        Structure; (b)     The\n                        US$5m VG (Vikas) Payment Structure; (c)     The Revaluation Excess VG (Vikas) Payment Structure;\n                        and (d)     The eSys\n                        India Transfer Structure. It was the defendant’s\n                    case that the abovementioned four investment structures were incorporated into\n                    agreements between the plaintiff and Teledata. The agreements are discussed in\n                    turn. 49     On 29 November 2006, a Share Subscription\n                    Agreement (“SSA”) was executed by the plaintiff, Vikas and\n                    Teledata. The key feature of the SSA was its investment structure (“the\n                    Holding Company Structure”) whereby: (a)     A special purpose vehicle\n                        (“SPV”) would be incorporated for the purpose of the\n                        investment (the SPV that was eventually incorporated was\n                    Rainforest); (b)     Vikas\n                        would transfer all his shares in the plaintiff to the SPV in consideration\n                        of approximately 49% of the shares in the SPV; and (c)     The SPV would provide a secured loan\n                        of US$60m to the plaintiff. In addition, the SSA provided\n                    that Teledata would also provide a loan of US$40m to either the plaintiff or the\n                    SPV. 50     On 29 November 2006, the plaintiff, Vikas\n                    and Teledata executed a supplemental agreement to the SSA (“First\n                    Supplemental”) which provided for the following: (a)     The plaintiff would transfer 48.6%\n                        of its shareholding in eSys India (a subsidiary of the plaintiff) to Vikas\n                        at a nominal consideration of US$1. Such a transfer resulted in Vikas\n                        – or his nominees – owning 49.9% of the shareholding in eSys\n                        India, and the plaintiff owning the remaining 50.1% of eSys India;\n                        and (b)     eSys India\n                        would enter into a Business Transfer Agreement with a new entity\n                        (“Newco”), which would provide for the transfer by eSys India\n                        of its existing business. eSys India retained its existing tangibles and\n                        fixed assets (including the land which it owned in India). Newco would then\n                        be owned by an entity known as Holdco, where Holdco would be 50.001% owned\n                        by Teledata and/or its nominees, and 49.999% owned by Vikas and/or his\n                        nominees. 51     The effect of the above structure meant that\n                    Teledata would own 50.001% interest in the business of eSys IndiaviaTeledata’s shareholding in Holdco. In\n                    addition, the First Supplemental provided for Holdco to pay the sum of US$5m to\n                    Vikas and/or his nominees. The First Supplemental also provided that parties\n                    would perform a revaluation of the plaintiff’s assets, and that should\n                    such revaluation of the plaintiff result in any surplus over the sum of US$60m,\n                    the surplus less the sum of US$5m would be paid to Vikas and/or his nominees\n                    (this was effectively the Revaluation Excess VG Payment Structure referred to in\n                    [48(c)]). 52     The effect of the First Supplemental was such\n                    that Teledata would own approximately 50% interest in the business of eSys India\n                    via Teledata’s shareholding in Holdco. 53     On 29 November 2006, the plaintiff, Vikas\n                    and Teledata entered into a Second Supplemental Agreement to the SSA\n                    (“Second Supplemental”). The salient amendment to the SSA, vide\n                    the Second Supplemental, was that Vikas was to be issued 60,000,000 shares in\n                    the SPV whilst Teledata was to be issued 60,000,001 shares in the\n                same. 54     On 9 February 2007 (after the\n                    defendant’s engagement was terminated), the plaintiff, Vikas and Teledata\n                    entered into the third supplemental agreement to the SSA (“Third\n                    Supplemental”). The Third Supplemental provided for a company Baytech Inc\n                    to be appointed as Teledata’s nominee. 55     On 14 February 2007, the plaintiff, Vikas\n                    and Teledata executed the fourth supplemental agreement to the SSA\n                    (“Fourth Supplemental”) which provided: (a)     Upon the completion of the\n                        subscription for shares in Rainforest by Vikas and Teledata, Vikas would\n                        sell 5,000,000 shares in Rainforest to Teledata in consideration of\n                        US$5m; (b)     Vikas\n                        would sell an additional 1,200,001 of his shares in Rainforest to Teledata\n                        for a sum of not less than US$1,200,001 or at a fair market value to be\n                        determined by the parties; and (c)     The Fourth Supplemental Agreement retained the Holding\n                        Company Structure. 56     As a result of the injection of funds into the\n                    plaintiff via the deal with Teledata, the defendant claimed that it was entitled\n                    to VAF computed at 5% of the value of such injection. VAF was payable on restructured supply creditor liabilities 57     The crux of the defendant’s claim was\n                    that the standstill it achieved with the bank creditors enabled the plaintiff to\n                    continue trading with its suppliers and further led to such suppliers not\n                    demanding immediate repayment of amounts owing to them. The defendant therefore\n                    claimed that it was entitled to VAF calculated on the basis of 5% of the\n                    supplier/trade creditor liabilities as\n                “restructured”.",
        "The law on implied terms": "27     Whether or not the plaintiff is entitled to an\n                    Account would depend on whether a relevant term can be implied in the Engagement\n                    Letter. The Court of Appeal succinctly summarised the law on implied terms inChua Choon Cheng and others v Allgreen Properties Ltd and\n                        another appeal[2009] 3 SLR(R) 724 (“Chua Choon Cheng”) (at [63]): It is settled law that “a court willnot\n                            lightlyimply a term into a contract” [emphasis\n                            original]:Jet Holding Ltd v Cooper Cameron\n                            (Singapore) Pte Ltd[2006] 3 SLR(R) 769 at [107].\n                        The rule of thumb is that the more detailed or complex a contract is, the\n                        less likely it is that the court will imply a term into that contract. The\n                        touchstone for implying a term into a contract is always “necessity\n                        and not merely reasonableness”:Hiap Hong & Co\n                            Pte Ltd v Hong Huat Development Co (Pte) Ltd[2001] 1\n                        SLR(R) 458 at [19].

We agree. 28     The threshold consideration of whether or not\n                    a term is necessary to be implied, alluded to by the Court of Appeal inChua Choon Chengwas discussed by Chao Hick\n                    Tin JA inHiap Hong & Co Pte Ltd v Hong HuatDevelopment Co (Pte) Ltd[2001] 1\n                    SLR(R) 458 (“Hiap Hong & Co Pte\n                    Ltd”) (at [19] –\n                    [20]): 19    Be that as it may,\n                            in considering the question of implied terms, it must be borne in mind\n                            that the touchstone is necessity and not merely reasonableness. In the\n                            words of Scrutton LJ inIn reComptoir Commercial Anversois and\n                                Power, Son & Co’s Arbitration[1920] 1 KB\n                            868 at 899–900: The Court … ought not to imply a term merely because it would\n                            be a reasonable term to include if the parties had thought about the\n                            matter, or because one party, if he had thought about the matter, would\n                            not have made the contract unless the term was included; it must be such\n                            a necessary term that both parties must have intended that it should be\n                            a term of the contract, and have only not expressed it because its\n                            necessity was so obvious that it was taken for granted. 20    Of course, a term to be implied must always be\n                            equitable and reasonable. The court will imply a term if from the\n                            language of the contract and the surrounding circumstances an inference\n                            should be made that the parties must have intended the stipulation in\n                            question. 29     It is well established that two tests may be\n                    applied in considering whether or not a term may be implied into a contract.\n                    They are commonly known as the “officious bystander” and\n                    “business efficacy” tests, and were summarised by Andrew Phang\n                    Boon Leong J inForefront Medical Technology (Pte) Ltd v\n                        Modern-Pak Pte Ltd[2006] 1 SLR(R) 927 (at [29] –\n                    [32]): 29    It has always been\n                            acknowledged that particular terms might be implied into particular\n                            contracts. However, in order not to undermine the concept of freedom of\n                            contract itself, terms would be implied only rarely – in\n                            exceptional cases where, as one famous case put it, it\n                                wasnecessaryto give\n                                “business efficacy” to\n                            the contract (seeperBowen LJ (as then was) in the English Court of\n                            Appeal decision inThe Moorcock(1889) 14 PD 64). In the words of Bowen LJ himself (at\n                        68): Now, an implied warranty, or, as it is called, a covenant in law, as\n                            distinguished from an express contract or express warranty, really is in\n                            all cases founded on the presumed intention of the parties, and upon\n                            reason. The implication which the law draws from what must obviously\n                            have been the intention of the parties, the law draws with the object of\n                            giving efficacy to the transaction and preventing such a failure of\n                            consideration as cannot have been within the contemplation of either\n                            side; and I believe if one were to take all the cases, and there are\n                            many, of implied warranties or covenants in law, it will be found that\n                            in all of them the law is raising an implication from the presumed\n                            intention of the parties with the object of giving to the transaction\n                            such efficacy as both parties must have intended that at all events it\n                            should have. In business transactions such as this, what the law desires\n                            to effect by the implication is to give such business efficacy to the\n                            transaction as must have been intended at all events by both parties who\n                            are business men; not to impose on one side all the perils of the\n                            transaction, or to emancipate one side from all the chances of failure,\n                            but to make each party promise in law as much, at all events, as it must\n                            have been in the contemplation of both parties that he should be\n                            responsible for in respect of those perils or chances. 30    Indeed,\n                            Lord Esher MR adopted a similar approach, although it is\n                            Bowen LJ’s judgment that is most often cited. This is\n                            probably due to the fact that a close perusal of\n                            Lord Esher MR’s judgment will reveal that the learned\n                            Master of the Rolls did notexplicitlyadopt the “business\n                            efficacy” test as such. It might be usefully observed at this\n                            juncture that the third judge, Fry LJ, agreed with both\n                            Bowen LJ and Lord Esher MR (see [29]supraat\n                            71). 31    There was another test,\n                            which soon became equally famous. It was by MacKinnon LJ in another\n                            English Court of Appeal decision. This was the famous “officious bystander” test which was\n                            propounded inShirlaw v Southern Foundries (1926)\n                                Limited[1939] 2 KB 206 at 227 (“Shirlaw”) (affirmed, [1940] AC 701), as\n                            follows: If I may quote from an essay which I wrote some years ago, I then\n                            said: “Prima facie that which in any contract is left to be\n                            implied and need not be expressed is something so obvious that it goes\n                            without saying; so that, if, while the parties were making their\n                            bargain, an officious bystander were to suggest some express provision\n                            for it in their agreement, they would testily suppress him with a common\n                            ‘Oh, of course!’” At least it is true, I think, that, if a term were never implied by a\n                            judge unless it could pass that test, he could not be held to be\n                            wrong. Interestingly, the essay referred to above was in fact a public lecture\n                        delivered at the London School of Economics in the University of London: see\n                        Sir Frank MacKinnon,Some Aspects of Commercial\n                            Law – A Lecture Delivered at the London School of Economics on\n                            3 March 1926(Oxford University Press, 1926) (and\n                        see, especially, p 13). 32    Both these tests are firmly established in the\n                            local case law (in addition to the cases cited below, see also, for\n                                example,Lim Eng Hock Peter v Batshita\n                                International (Pte) Ltd[1996] 2 SLR (R) 292 at\n                            [13]–[15] (affirmed inBatshita\n                                International (Pte) Ltd v Lim Eng Hock Peter[1996] 3 SLR\n                            (R) 563 andChai Chung Ching Chester v Diversey\n                                (Far East) Pte Ltd[1991] 1 SLR (R) 757 at [34]\n                            (affirmed inDiversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai\n                                Chung Ching Chester[1992] 3 SLR (R) 412), with\n                            regard to the “business efficacy” and “officious\n                            bystander” tests, respectively. 30     With the relevant legal principles in mind, I\n                    turn now to analyse the parties’ respective cases.",
        "The decision": "63     The defendant’s entitlement to VAF\n                    hinged upon whether or not it had performed work which satisfied the conditions\n                    precedent to such entitlement pursuant to the Engagement Letter (at[11]above). I turn now to address each of the\n                    defendant’s claims in this respect. VAF on restructured bank liabilities 64     The critical issue for determination is, did\n                    the informal standstill by the banksrestructureliabilities pursuant to the VAF clause? It was not disputed that the defendant\n                    was instrumental in getting the bank creditors to agree to an informal\n                    standstill. What was disputed, however, was whether the informal standstill\n                    “restructured” the liabilities of the plaintiff in a manner which\n                    would entitle the defendant to a VAF. According to the defendant’s case,\n                    it had completed item (iii) of the Scope of Work Clause (see[10]above) by advising and assisting the\n                    plaintiff in restructuring the plaintiff’s financial arrangements, which\n                    led to the plaintiff’s liabilities being restructured or avoided pursuant\n                    to (a) of the VAF Clause (at[13]above). 65     In my view, given the context in which the\n                    Engagement Letter was entered into, the standstill agreement undoubtedly\n                    entitled the defendant to claim VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter.\n                    Consequently, VAF is payable to the defendant calculated at 5% of the total bank\n                    liabilities which were the subject of the standstill agreement. The reasons are\n                    set out below. 66     The context in which the Engagement Letter was\n                    entered into is critical in determining exactly what the plaintiff sought to\n                    achieve in restructuring its liabilities. Vikas had stated the following in\n                    cross-examination: Q:The context in which this scope of work [under the\n                            Engagement Letter] was sought was the banks were seeking payments\n                            against you on an urgent basis; correct? A:Yes Q:And you needed breathing space? A:Yes Q:And you needed nTan to assist you [to] restructure\n                            the obligations; correct? A:I wouldn’t say “restructure”,\n                            but talk to the banks to adopt a path which made sense, that we would be\n                            able to pay off – just breathing space, as you would put it,\n                            yes. Q:“Breathing space” means they would\n                            hold back on their demands against you; correct? A:They would give us some time Q:And not enforce the demands against you;\n                            right? A:Will not go in for litigation or judicial\n                            management. Q:Which is to enforce the demands against you;\n                            yes? A:I mean, if you put it that way, yes. 67     At a later stage, Vikas had (in\n                    cross-examination) conceded that the main reason why the plaintiff hired the\n                    defendant was so that the latter could help the former obtain a standstill and a\n                    breathing space from the bank creditors: Q:Your banks didn’t want to back off, right?\n                            They were making demand after demand, and we saw that. A:Yes Q:What you needed was an ability to stave off the\n                            demands until such time when you were able to pay them;\n                        right? A:Yes. Q:That’s why you went to consult with Drew\n                            & Napier and accepted their advice to consult with Mr Nicky\n                            Tan? A:Yes. 68     Consequently, it cannot be disputed that the\n                    work done by the defendant was crucial in ensuring that the bank creditors\n                    agreed not to enforce their claims against the plaintiff immediately. In this\n                    regard, Louis Han of HSBC, who was present at the Meeting testified as\n                    follows: Q:...First, in order for the bank to agree to an\n                            informal standstill, would you agree that the bank must first be given\n                            comfort that the bank has a chance of being better off if you allow the\n                            company to trade as a going concern than if you move in and put in\n                            insolvency professionals immediately? A:That would be correct, yes Q:And in order for you to get that comfort, you must\n                            be able to see from the financials presented at this meeting that the\n                            company indeed, based on its own financials, is able to continue to\n                            trade as a going concern, with a better – with the prospect of a\n                            better realisation at the end. A:That is the ultimate objective, yes, to maximise\n                            recovery, yes. Q:Yes. And you should also expect to see, as you had\n                            asked, a realistic repayment plan coming up from the company;\n                            correct? A:Yeah, a repayment plan, restructuring plan,\n                            whatever – yeah. Yeah, sure. Q:If you were given that amount of comfort, then you\n                            would be prepared to agree to a standstill? A:Yes, of course, because to do a standstill, we want\n                            to make sure that certain controls are in place, to make sure that\n                            someone is there to ensure there is no preferential\n                        treatment. ... Q:In the end, an informal standstill was given to the\n                            company, was it not? A:It was, yeah. No banks took actions, so it was a\n                            – there was an informal standstill, yeah because – I think I\n                            will clarify: “standstill” means formal or informal. We\n                            have a formal standstill, it means everybody sign up on a piece of\n                            paper. 69     It is also not in dispute that the informal\n                    standstill allowed the plaintiff to repay the bank creditors eventually by March\n                    2007. Vikas admitted that after the Meeting, none of the bank creditors filed\n                    writs or attempted to wind up the plaintiff. As a result, the plaintiff was able\n                    to realise its receivables and inventories in an orderly fashion and which\n                    enabled it to repay the bank creditors. 70     I further noted that Vikas conceded at one\n                    stage during cross-examination that he actually considered the informal\n                    standstill to constitute restructuring of the plaintiff’s existing\n                    liabilities: Q:I wanted to understand from you what you understood\n                            “restructuring financial arrangements” to mean. And\n                            I’m suggesting to you that it means to help with the banks in a\n                            way which would allow you breathing space. A:Yes. Q:Would you agree with that? A:Agree. Q:That means, because the context in which this\n                            agreement was entered into was all the demands that the banks had been\n                            making against you, that means giving the banks sufficient comfort and\n                            to assuage their concerns so that they will not enforce their demands\n                            against you; correct? A:Yes. 71     Vikas’ concession during\n                    cross-examination is unsurprising, given that the survival of the plaintiff\n                    hinged upon whether or not it received more time to repay its debts. However,\n                    Vikas shifted his position during re-examination and proffered a new general\n                    definition of “restructuring”: Restructuring, especially in context of banks, and you read it in the\n                        newspapers every day, with every day some company undergoing this or that.\n                        Basically means either the banks take a haircut; they say, “Instead\n                        of $100 I take $50” – or $25, whatever; or they say,\n                        “Okay, we waive you of interest” or give you – I mean, a\n                        loan in a different format. And then sometimes in terms of time period also,\n                        it is – short-term borrowings are converted into long term loans which\n                        could be three years or – like, minimum, one to two years but three\n                        years, five years, with soft interest rates and payment plans where the\n                        business could be revised and the money could be paid. 72     Vikas further attempted to proffer his\n                    definition of “restructured” in the context of the Engagement\n                    Letter: Well, the clear-cut understanding for me, and also during the discussions,\n                        was if I owe someone $100, it becomes $50; out of the 50, he keeps 5 per\n                        cent, I keep 95 percent. Not if I have to pay the same amount of money and\n                        still on top of that I pay another 5 percent, because there was no way I\n                        would be able to pay that 5 percent or it would have made any sense. 73     In my view, Vikas’ suggestion as to what\n                    he viewed as “restructuring” in the context of the Engagement\n                    Letter was an afterthought. It was clear that at the material time, the\n                    plaintiff was satisfied to have its debts “restructured” in any\n                    manner which would ensure its continued viability – and that such a result\n                    could only be achieved if its existing obligations for immediate repayment to\n                    the bank creditors were deferred. Vikas’ purported definition of the term\n                    “restructure” was also completely untenable as it would limit the\n                    definition of the said term to a deal which accorded the plaintiff with a\n                    reduction in its total liabilities. 74     Given the context in which the Engagement\n                    Letter was entered into, this clearly was not the case. The plaintiff was eager\n                    to “restructure” its liabilities in a manner which accorded it\n                    valuable time to repay its obligations. In this regard, there were many ways in\n                    which this could have been achieved. For instance if, instead of the informal\n                    standstill, the defendant had obtained the agreement of all the bank creditors\n                    to accept bonds issued by the plaintiff at 5% interest over the course of 5\n                    years, the plaintiff’s total monetary liability would still have been\n                    increased. Yet, in such a situation, the plaintiff would be hard pressed to\n                    argue that its liabilities had not been restructured even though all that the\n                    bond issue achieved would have been additional time for the plaintiff to repay\n                    its debts, albeit at a higher total cost. 75     I am therefore of the view that the informal\n                    standstill constituted restructuring of the plaintiff’s liabilitiesvis-à-visthe bank creditors because the\n                    character of such liabilities had morphed dramatically. Prior to the informal\n                    standstill being granted, the plaintiff’s liabilities were due and\n                    payable. This was a situation which could potentially cripple the plaintiff.\n                    After the informal standstill was granted, the plaintiff’s bank\n                    liabilities were no longer due and payable forthwith. The plaintiff was\n                    therefore given the crucial breathing space it needed to repay its debts within\n                    an unspecified period of time. In the result, I find that the plaintiff’s\n                    liabilities in relation to the bank creditors were restructured pursuant to the\n                    VAF clause as there was a significant shift in the temporal nature of such\n                    liabilities. Was VAF payable on the Teledata deal? 76     The defendant’s claim in respect of VAF\n                    payable on the Teledata deal, was: first, pursuant to (v) of the Scope of Work\n                    Clause (at[10]above) whereby the defendant\n                    had assisted the plaintiff in securing an investor,ie, Teledata. Second, the defendant’s work it was\n                    submitted, had resulted in the injection of new equity raised by the plaintiff\n                    pursuant to (c) of the VAF Clause (at[13]above). 77     The plaintiff denied that the defendant had\n                    performed work in relation to the deal involving Teledata. As a secondary\n                    argument, the plaintiff contended that the injection of funds by Teledata did\n                    not benefit the plaintiff. As a result, it was submitted, the defendant was not\n                    entitled to VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter. I turn now to consider the\n                    two issues in turn. Whether Nicky had performed work in relation to the Teledata\n                deal 78     In the course of the trial, it was patently\n                    clear that the plaintiff’s position that the defendant was not involved in\n                    the Teledata deal was untenable. Prior to the defendant being informed of the\n                    proposed investment by Teledata, the plaintiff was contemplating the execution\n                    of a deal with Teledata which was completely different from that which was\n                    eventually executed. This is clear from the draft LOI which envisioned a direct\n                    injection of cash by Teledata into the plaintiff in exchange for 60% shares in\n                    the plaintiff. Based upon the draft LOI and the complete absence of any evidence\n                    that the plaintiff was aware of the Holding Company Structure before the\n                    involvement of the defendant, it was evident that the only investment structure\n                    which was contemplated by the plaintiff and Vikas – prior to the\n                    involvement of the defendant – was a direct injection of funds by Teledata\n                    in consideration for shares. The question which immediately arose is: why were\n                    the agreements (at [49]\n                    –\n                    [55]) markedly different\n                    from the draft LOI? 79     Nicky’s evidence as to why he had\n                    advised Vikas to adopt the investment structures was not only logical and\n                    cogent, it was also not contradicted at trial. Nicky testified that he met Vikas\n                    on 25 November 2006, and on this occasion explained the Holding Company\n                    Structure to Vikas diagrammatically; (the drawing was admitted into evidence).\n                    Vikas alleged, during the course of the trial, that it was he who had taught\n                    Nicky about the Holding Company Structure at the meeting on 25 November\n                    2006. This allegation was, in my view, completely spurious. Nicky’s\n                    expertise at the material time, in the realm of corporate finance was\n                    encapsulated in hiscurriculam vitae. In addition,\n                    if Vikas had personal knowledge of the sophisticated investment structures\n                    – without assistance from Nicky – which were eventually incorporated\n                    into the agreements, then Vikas would not have consulted Nicky at all in the\n                    first place. 80     Consequently, I have no hesitation in finding\n                    that the Holding Company Structure was incorporated in the agreements between\n                    Teledata and the plaintiff, because of the defendant’s advice to the\n                    plaintiff. 81     Nicky had contended that he initiated the idea\n                    of US$5m VG Payment Structure and the Revaluation Excess VG Payment Structure\n                    which were eventually incorporated in the agreements between Teledata and the\n                    plaintiff. In support of his contention, the defendant tendered a Bundle of\n                    Teledata Diagrams (“Diagrams”) which provided contemporaneous\n                    notes supporting Nicky’s assertion. Neither Nicky’s evidence in this\n                    regard nor the contents of the Diagrams were challenged by the plaintiff. As\n                    such, I find that the defendant had advised the plaintiff on the aforementioned\n                    two structures which were incorporated in the agreements between Teledata and\n                    the plaintiff.",

The\n                    plaintiff’s inability to meet its repayment obligations was due to the\n                    nature of its operations. As a trading company whose primary assets were\n                    inventories and receivables, the plaintiff needed to realise its inventories and\n                    collect its receivables in order to meet its liabilities. This much was conceded\n                    by Vikas in cross-examination: Q:At that point in time, as of – let’s\n                            fix a date – end of October 2006, the total amount of outstanding\n                            was not something that you had in your bank which you could meet;\n                            correct?

These are not\n                            amounts that you would not have been able to pay; you just needed\n                            time? A:Yes Q:You needed some amount of indulgence so that you\n                            would be able to collect receivables, make your trades, collect money\n                            from the trades and pay off your various creditors; right?

        "The law on contractual interpretation": "62     The Court of Appeal inZurich Insurance (Singapore) Pte Ltd v B-Gold Interior Design &\n                        Construction Pte Ltd[2008] 3 SLR(R) 1029 (“Zurich Insurance”) endorsed the contextual\n                    approach to contractual interpretation (Zurich\n                        Insuranceat [121]). Such an approach permits reference to\n                    extrinsic evidence even if the term involved is not ambiguous (Zurich Insuranceat [114] – [120] and [132(c)]).\n                    There are two conditions precedent to the use of such extrinsic evidence: first,\n                    that the evidence must be “relevant [and] reasonably available to all the\n                    contracting parties”; second, that it must “relate to a clear or\n                    obvious context” (Zurich Insuranceat\n                    [132(d)], see also [125] and [128] – [129]).",
        "The findings": "Whether the Teledata deal involved injection of equity into the\n                plaintiff 82     I find that the plaintiff’s argument\n                    that the defendant was precluded from claiming VAF in respect of the Teledata\n                    deal, because the injection of funds accrued to Rainforest, was totally\n                    unmeritorious. This is because the Teledata deal was structured in a manner\n                    which benefitted the plaintiff whilst Rainforest was a mere shell. This was\n                    readily apparent from the agreements between Teledata and the plaintiff. In\n                    short, Rainforest was merely a conduit to achieve the end of raising funds for\n                    the plaintiff. Was VAF payable on the trade and supplier liabilities? 83     The defendant had also claimed VAF (see para\n                    24(4) and (5) of the defence) for its advice to the plaintiff’s management\n                    in collecting receivables, on how to manage suppliers who were concerned about\n                    Seagate’s termination as well as the plaintiff’s creditors. At\n                    Vikas’ behest, the defendant dealt directly with Western Digital\n                    Corporation, one of the plaintiff’s largest suppliers, on payment and\n                    return of inventory. 84     The plaintiff’s former chief financial\n                    officer, Chay Suet Meng (“Emily”), and Nicky were cross-examined\n                    on this aspect of the defendant’s claim. Emily had confirmed that the\n                    defendant assisted the plaintiff to answer questions raised by vendors and had\n                    advised her not to make undue preference payments to the plaintiff’s\n                    creditors and suppliers. She further agreed that the defendant had to analyse\n                    the plaintiff’s prospects of recoverability of trade receivables from its\n                    debtors. Emily did not affirm an AEIC for her testimony. Instead, a draft AEIC\n                    was presented to her in court (in exhibit P1) which she confirmed save for\n                    certain amendments. The thrust of Emily’s testimony was that the defendant\n                    hardly did any meaningful work (except for work done for the Meeting) so as to\n                    earn the invoiced sums. I find this to be an unfair glossing over of the work\n                    carried out by the defendant. In my view, Emily’s testimony may well have\n                    been coloured by the fact that she is currently employed by a company (Ezy\n                    Global Infotech FZE) which is largely owned by Vikas’\n                family. 85     Nicky had testified that two to three members\n                    of his staff (including Dan Yock Hian (“Dan”)) were stationed at\n                    the plaintiff’s office on a daily basis from mid-November 2006 to early\n                    January 2007. The defendant implemented a disbursement request payment policy\n                    which stipulated that the plaintiff’s management must give its approval\n                    before payments were disbursed in order to avoid undue preference payments being\n                    made by the plaintiff. It was also to ensure that the plaintiff made essential\n                    payments such as salaries and CPF contributions and paid parties that enabled\n                    the plaintiff to continue trading, such as its suppliers and\n                vendors. 86     It was also Nicky’s evidence that the\n                    defendant’s staff had to manage the plaintiff’s operations in the\n                    initial period of the defendant’s engagement because, at that time, Vikas\n                    had apparently fled Singapore for fear of being investigated by the Commercial\n                    Affairs Department of the Corrupt Practices Investigation Bureau. Whilst this\n                    allegation was denied by Vikas, the undisputed fact remains that he and Emily\n                    were constantly on the telephone with Nicky (as evidenced by Nicky’s\n                    mobile telephone bills in exhibit D5). Vikas had 6 telephone conversations with\n                    Nicky, while Emily had 40 telephone conversations with Nicky and 81 telephone\n                    conversations with Dan. She had also exchanged 60 short message services with\n                    them. I should add that Nicky’s evidence that Vikas spoke to him on\n                    Christmas Eve of 2006 for 16.3 minutes on the Teledata deal was also evidenced\n                    in exhibit D5. Nicky testified that he took the telephone call on his mobile\n                    telephone because Vikas was afraid that Nicky’s land-line was\n                    tapped. 87     I find that the frequency of the telephone\n                    conversations between Vikas and Emily with Nicky as well as the\n                    defendant’s staff does not support the allegation that the defendant did\n                    very little work for the plaintiff during the short period of the\n                    defendant’s engagement. 88     While the evidence conclusively shows that\n                    Nicky did substantial work in relation to the plaintiff’s trade partners\n                    and suppliers, the question remains as to whether such work entitled the\n                    defendant to VAF. In resolving this issue, the parties’ intentions –\n                    as evinced in the VAF Clause at[13]above\n                    – is critical. In this regard, only (a) of the VAF Clause is relevant and\n                    Nicky’s work, as discussed at[83]–[87]above, must have resulted in the\n                    plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities being “written off,\n                    extinguished, avoided or restructured” in order for a claim for VAF to\n                    succeed. 89     In my view, the defendant’s work in\n                    relation to the plaintiff did not entitle the former to VAF. The main difference\n                    between the plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities and its bank creditor\n                    liabilities is that there was actually an informal standstill agreed to between\n                    the bank creditors. That was the restructuring of a significant temporal nature\n                    which took place in relation to the plaintiff’s liabilitiesvis a visits bank creditors. Such a standstill did not\n                    take place in relation to the plaintiff’s trade/supplier liabilities. On\n                    the contrary, the evidence showed that the plaintiffmet(emphasis added) its liabilities to its trade/supply\n                    creditors. Whilst the defendant undoubtedly played a key role in ensuring that\n                    the plaintiff met its obligations towards its trade/supply creditors, such work\n                    was only compensable pursuant to the Fees Clause as no value add – as\n                    defined in the VAF Clause – occurred.",
        "The plaintiff’s claim": "90     In regard to the plaintiff’s claim for\n                    an Account, I had earlier held (at [33]) that it was an implied term that the defendant would be\n                    liable to render an Account to the plaintiff. However, the plaintiff should have\n                    requested for the same within a reasonable period after the defendant’s\n                    services were terminated which, as noted earlier (at [25]), was not the case. I\n                    accept in this regard the defendant’s submission that Vikas had\n                    deliberately waited until after 3½ years had lapsed and the\n                    plaintiff’s assets had been “hollowed out of the company”\n                    before he requested for an Account. Vikas (who is funding this action) wanted to\n                    ensure that the plaintiff was judgment proof before it commenced proceedings\n                    against the defendant. Indeed, the plaintiff’s latest audited accounts as\n                    of 31 March 2009 showed it was/is insolvent as its liabilities exceeded its\n                    assets by some US$14m. 91     As the plaintiff’s claim for an Account\n                    is a claim in equity, I find that there was an inexplicable delay in making the\n                    claim bearing in mind that the first time the plaintiff requested for an Account\n                    was by its solicitor’s letter dated 6 August 2010, well after the\n                    defendant’s second invoice had been issued on 6 February 2007.\n                    Although it was not said in so many words, the defendant’s complaint that\n                    the claim was not made timeously is really that laches applied and the plaintiff\n                    should be denied this relief even though its claim was not time-barred. At the\n                    very least, the maxim: delay defeats equities should apply to the plaintiff. Had\n                    the plaintiff made its claim while it still had assets (vizbefore 31 March 2009), the defendant would have been\n                    able to enforce its judgment if it succeeded in its counterclaim. 92     I accept the defendant’s contention that\n                    the plaintiff’s request and current claim for an Account was neither\n                    genuine norbona fideand should not now be\n                    entertained. The plaintiff has nothing to lose if its claim for an Account is\n                    unsuccessful. Apart from the security for costs it had furnished to the\n                    defendant, the plaintiff has no assets against which the defendant can have\n                    recourse to for its costs, over and above the $200,000 security. In this regard\n                    Vikas’ statements under cross-examination are telling: Q:I’m suggesting to you that you chose August\n                            2010, or September 2010 deliberately, as the date on which you could\n                            safely embark on this litigation without any downside to yourself.\n                            Isn’t that true? A:Not true. Q:Would you be prepared to personally guarantee the\n                            payment of any judgment sum that may be awarded to Mr Tan? A:And why would I like to do that? Q:Would you be prepared to do that? A:No. Q:Would you be prepared to guarantee the costs that\n                            will be paid to Mr Tan beyond the 100,000 should he be entitled to\n                            costs? A:We have already deposited the 100,000 as opposed to\n                            --- Court:Answer the question. Mr Tong:I said beyond the 100,000, Mr\n                        Goel. A:No. Q:So you are content to sit here in your litigation\n                            knowing that there is no downside on judgment, debt or on costs against\n                            you, but with every potential upside, and you hide behind eSys, the\n                            company, as a shareholder funding this litigation, and collecting the\n                            fruits of the litigation, but at the same time running off to Dubai or\n                            to India should there be an adverse award against you. That’s in\n                            reality the position you’re in today, isn’t\n                        it? A:I disagree… 93     I found Vikas to be an untruthful witness\n                    whose evidence could not be believed. I say this because he had been caught\n                    lying in many other instances besides the incidents referred to at [799] and[86]above. As an example, I refer to\n                    another portion of his testimony where Vikas alleged that Nicky had told him\n                    that Nicky had lied in affidavits filed by the defendant on behalf of Asia Pulp\n                    & Paper Company Ltd (“APP”) in Originating Petition No 2 of\n                    2002 (seeDeutsche Bank AG & Another v Asia Pulp &\n                        Paper Company Ltd[2002] SGHC 257). I had pointed out to Vikas\n                    that I dealt with that matter and had dismissed the bank plaintiffs’\n                    application to appoint judicial managers for APP. I did not recall Nicky filing\n                    any false affidavits in that case. The only affidavit he filed was to give his\n                    opinion that putting APP into judicial management was not in the interests of\n                    APP’s creditors. 94     In contrast to Vikas’ many\n                    inconsistencies, Nicky gave his evidence in a clear and forthright manner and\n                    without hesitation or contradictions.",
        "Conclusion": "95     I find that by virtue of the work done by the\n                    defendant, it is entitled to VAF pursuant to the Engagement Letter in respect\n                    of: (i) the bank liabilities that were successfully restructured by Nicky, and\n                    (ii) the Teledata deal. The defendant is therefore awarded interlocutory\n                    judgment with costs on its counterclaim for VAF. An inquiry shall be held by the\n                    Registrar to determine the amount of VAF with costs of such inquiry reserved to\n                    the Registrar together with interest on the VAF assessed. The VAF amount when\n                    assessed shall be paid from the balance of the Deposit. The balance thereafter\n                    of the Deposit if any, shall be utilised to pay any outstanding costs due from\n                    the plaintiff to the defendant over and above the security for costs of\n                    $200,000. 96     It follows that the plaintiff’s claim\n                    for a refund of the balance of the Deposit is dismissed with costs. Both sets of\n                    costs awarded to the defendant are to be taxed on a standard basis unless\n                    otherwise agreed."
