        "Introduction": "1       The\nplaintiff, Alpha Bank S.A. (“the Bank”), applied as mortgagees on 20\nDecember 2013videSummons No 6520\nof 2013 (“SUM 6520”) for the vessel,Sea Urchin,\nof the port of Limassol, Cyprus (“the Vessel”) to be soldpendente liteto a named buyer and at\na stated price (ie, prayer 2 of\nSUM 6520). As an alternative to a direct judicial sale, the Bank’s\nfall-back application was for the Vessel to be soldpendente\nliteby the Sheriff in the usual way by public auction\nor private treaty (ie, prayer 2a\nof SUM 6520). 2       In\nthis case, the Bank arrested the Vessel fully laden with a cargo\nof soya beans in bulk. At the time of the arrest, the Vessel was\nin Singapore for bunkers en route to Qingdao, China where the cargo\nwas to be discharged and delivered to receivers. The purpose of\nthe direct salependente litewas for\nthe Vessel under new ownership to carry and discharge the cargo\nin Qingdao. The question to be decided is whether the facts of this\ncase constitute special circumstances to warrant a direct judicial\nsale to a named buyer at a specified price (seeTheTurtle Bay[2013] 4 SLR 615 (“The Turtle Bay”) at [29]).",
        "Chronology of proceedings leading\nto the application for a direct sale": "3       The\nVessel, a bulk carrier fully laden with a cargo of soya beans, was arrested\nby the Bank on 30 October 2013 after the defendant shipowner, Keel\nMarine Company Limited (“the Defendant”), a company incorporated under\nthe laws of Cyprus, defaulted on a loan agreement that was secured by\na first priority mortgage of the Vessel. The Defendant entered an appearance\nto the Bank’sin remaction on 31\nOctober 2013. On 18 November 2013, the Defendant appliedvideSummons No 5874 of 2013 to,inter alia, (a) set aside the warrant\nof arrest; and (b) stay the action in favour of the Greek courts,\nincluding a temporary release of the Vessel to enable her to continue\nher voyage to China and to discharge the cargo on board. By the\ntime the Bank’s application in SUM 6520 was listed for hearing on\n6 January 2014, the Defendant had reached a private arrangement\nwith the Bank. Mr Lawrence Teh for the Defendant thus informed the\ncourt that the Defendant was not opposing the Bank’s application\nfor a direct sale. Before this court, the Defendant was no longer\nchallenging the propriety of the Bank’s claim or the arrest. 4       There\nwere three other interested parties supporting the Bank’s application\nfor a direct sale. It was made known at the outset by counsel representing\nthose interests that their support did not extend to prayer 2a in SUM\n6520. Mr Kelly Yap (“Mr Yap”) represented the intervener, Qingdao Bohi\nAgricultural Development Co Ltd (“the Intervener”), which was granted\nleave to intervene in these proceedings on 6 January 2014, and entered\nan appearance on 17 January 2014. 5       Ms\nWendy Tan (“Ms Tan”) represented Pacific Bulk Shipping (Cayman)\nLtd (“Pacific Bulk”) which trip-chartered the Vessel from Swissmarine\nServices S.A. (“Swissmarine”), the time charterers of the Vessel.\nPacific Bulk in turn sub-chartered the Vessel to the Intervener.\nThe Intervener is asserting rights of ownership to the cargo of\nsoya beans. Pacific Bulk claims ownership of the bunkers on board.\nSwissmarine was represented by Mr K Muralitherapany (“Mr Murali”).\nMr Edmund Koh stood in for Mr Murali at the adjourned hearing on\n27 January 2014. For convenience, Pacific Bulk and Swissmarine are\ncollectively referred to as “the Charterers”. 6       The\nCharterers had not intervened but through their counsel undertook\nto do so on 27 January 2014.",
        "The Turtle\nBay": "7       As\nprayer 2 is for a direct judicial sale, I begin withTheTurtleBaywhere it was observed that a direct\njudicial sale at a pre-determined price to a named person is generally\nnot the accepted way to sell a vessel under arrest. A direct judicial\nsale represents a departure from the normal order that the Sheriff\nsells a vessel under arrest by appraisement, advertisement, and\ninviting bids to purchase the vessel: see O 70 of the Rules of Court\n(Cap 322, R 5, 2006 Rev Ed) (“the Rules of Court”). More often than\nnot, an application for a court-sanctioned private sale is advanced\nfor the applicant’s own purpose and benefit and isprima\nfacieunfair (The Turtle Bayat\n[23]). InThe Turtle BayI referred\ntoBank of Scotland plc v The Owners of the\nMV Union Gold and others[2013] EWHC 1696 (Admlty) (“The Union Gold”) where Teare J held at\n[20] that as a matter of general principle the court should not\norder a sale to a buyer found by the arresting party at a pre-determined\nprice. 8       Basically,\nan admiralty judicial sale confers on the purchaser clean title\nof the vessel by transferring existing maritime claims of allin remclaimants against the vessel to\nthe sale proceeds of the vessel. I explained inTheTurtle Bayat [15] that “this concomitant\ntransfer of maritime claims (and priority) from the vessel to the\nproceeds of sale in court is theraison d’etreof\nthe principle that a judicial sale is for the protection and benefit\nof all persons interested in theres;\nit is not only for the interest of the arresting party alone”. At\n[17]–[18], I went on to explain the procedural safeguards in the\nsale process in the following manner: 17    To\nprotect the interests of all persons within\nremclaims against the vessel including the defendant\nshipowner, the court has to have entire control over the sale process\nthereby safeguarding the propriety and integrity of the sale process\nand, ultimately, instilling confidence and standing of the judicial sale\nfrom this jurisdiction. To this end, there are comprehensive procedures in\nO 70 for a court-ordered judicial sale to be carried out by the\nSheriff pursuant to a commission for appraisement to ascertain the\nvalue of the vessel, by the placement of advertisements and invitation\nto submit bids for the purchase of the vessel. 18    Once the Sheriff is commissioned to\nappraise and sell the vessel, he is under a duty to first appraise\nthe vessel to ascertain the value. The Sheriff would be assisted\nby professional and experienced appraisers who as court-appointed\nappraisers have to act faithfully and impartially. The amount of\nthe appraised value is kept confidential so as not to affect the\nprice at which bids are received. Ordinarily, the Sheriff would\naccept the highest bid price unless it is below the appraised value.\nWhen the court is asked to exercise its discretion to approve a\njudicial sale where the highest bid price is below the appraised\nvalue, the Sheriff hands over the confidential appraisement report of\nthe court-appointed appraiser in a sealed envelope for the court’s consideration.\nAt no point in time would the amount of the appraisal be revealed\nto the public. In doing so, the integrity of the judicial sale process\nis preserved. 9       With\nregard to the importance of placing advertisements, I further held\nat [20] that: 20    The\nplacing of advertisements not only publicise the sale to a wider audience\ninterested in bidding for the vessel to obtain the best possible\nbid price, but they also serve to notify the sale to all others\ninterested in the vessel so that they can come forward and establish\ntheir maritime claims. These interested parties include other claimants\nthat may not have issuedin remwrits\nor filed caveats against release but have an interest in the vessel\nand sale. 10     InThe Turtle Bay, I concluded that a direct\nsale may be allowed in special circumstances. The applicant for\na direct sale must identify the existence of “powerful special features”\nor ‘special circumstances” before the court will be prepared to\norder a direct sale to a named buyer at a pre-determined price (TheTurtle Bayat\n[29]). Needless to say, such an application for a direct sale will\nbe scrutinised carefully.",
        "Arguments advanced for a direct\nsalependente lite": "11     I\nbegin with the Bank’s arguments for a direct sale of the Vesselpendente liteto a named buyer at a specified\nprice. As stated, the purpose of the direct salependente\nlitewas for the Vessel under new ownership to carry the\ncargo to China. 12     The\napplication was premised on several factors that were advanced by\nthe Bank, the Intervener, and the Charterers. First, there was a\nnamed buyer of the Vessel, Okeanos Shipping Inc. (“Okeanos”), a\ncompany incorporated in the Marshall Islands, whose offer price\nof US$17.5m was US$1.5m more that the value of the Vessel, which\nthe Bank claimed to be US$16m. In addition, Okeanos, a subsidiary\ncompany of a customer of the Bank, was willing to purchase the Vessel\nand carry the cargo to China for delivery to the Intervener. In\nthat connection, the Intervener and the Charterers had entered into\nan undated agreement with Okeanos. When queried on when that agreement\nwas concluded, Mr Murali informed the court that Swissmarine had\nsigned the undated agreement on 20 December 2013. It was also pointed\nout that Okeanos was prepared to sign on the existing crew members\nunder new ownership for the voyage to China. 13     Other\nfactors strenuously emphasised by Mr Yap acting for the Intervener\nwere that the cargo was worth US$40m and that it was slowly but\nsurely losing commercial value with each day of delay. Mr Yap also relied\non a report of Mr Eric Mullen, the Regional Director of Dr J Burgoyne\n& Partners (International) Ltd, a practice of consultant scientists and\nengineers specialising in forensic investigations of fires, explosions, engineering\nfailures and other incidents, to show that the cargo on board had\nstarted to deteriorate.[note: 1]It\nwas also pointed out by the Intervener and the Charterers that a\ndirect judicial sale to the named buyer was the best option for\na variety of reasons. First, the cargo could not be landed in Singapore\nas there were no storage facilities available for such a huge quantity\nof cargo, even on a temporary basis. Second, whilst it was not impossible\nto tranship the cargo, there had been difficulties finding a suitable\ntranshipment vessel in December 2013, resulting in the inability\nto meet the schedule given by the terminal (presumably Jurong Port)\nfor the transhipment vessel and the Vessel to berth alongside for\ntranshipment.[note: 2]Further\ndelays occasioned by transhipping the cargo would adversely affect the\ncondition of the cargo and, hence, its value. Third, the costs of transhipment\nwere estimated to be US$700,000.[note: 3]Finally,\nthe costs of discharge, estimated to be in the region of S$2.28m[note: 4], would\nbe high and this expenditure would eat into the sale proceeds of\nthe Vessel, thereby reducing the pool of sale proceeds available\nto potentialin remcreditors.[note: 5]In\nsummary, it was submitted that all these factors collectively constituted special\ncircumstances warranting a salependente liteof\nthe Vessel to the named buyer at the stated price of US$17.5m. 14     Mr\nWinston Kwek (“Mr Kwek”) acting for the Bank relied on the Canadian\ncase ofBank of Scotland v “Nel” (The)(1997)\n140 FTR 271 (“The Nel”) in support\nof its application for a direct sale. Mr Yap and Mr Murali also\nrelied onThe NelandThe Union Gold(see [7] above). These\ncases were discussed in my earlier decision ofThe\nTurtle Bay.",
        "Discussion on the alleged special\ncircumstances": "",
        "Value of the Vessel and the\npre-determined price": "15     In\nthis application, the Bank submitted that Okeanos had offered to buy\nthe Vessel at US$17.5m which was US$1.5m above her market value\nof US$16m. The Bank produced the valuation certificate of a Greek shipbroker\nknown as Golden Destiny. Relying on Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate,\nMr Kwek, Mr Yap, Mr Murali and Ms Tan collectively emphasised that\nthe direct sale to Okeanos would be above the valuation of US$16m.\nOn the other hand, Assistant Registrar Ms Jacqueline Lee (“AR Lee”)\nacting on behalf of the Sheriff contended that Golden Destiny’s valuation\ncertificate addressed to the Bank was so qualified that it had little or\nno evidential value. 16     I\nagree with AR Lee that the valuation certificate issued by Golden Destiny\nwas unsatisfactory and that the absence of a satisfactory valuation undermined\nthe Bank’s application. Significantly, Golden Destiny expressly stated\nin its valuation certificate that the value of US$16m was specifically for\n10 December 2013 and that it was not expressing an opinion on the Vessel’s\nvalue for any other date. It is helpful to set out the relevant\nparts of Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate: Having examined the particulars given and\non the assumption that the vessel is without any latent defects\nor any class recommendations, we would estimate the market value\nof [the Vessel], basis prompt charter free delivery, between willing\nBuyers and willing Sellers, for cash payment on normal sale terms\nto be:About U.S.$16,000,000 (Sixteen Million\nUnited States Dollars). The figure mentioned\nabove [US$16m] relates solely to our opinion of the market value\nas at10thDecember\n2013and should not be taken to\napply at any other date. Further, we can give no assurance that\nsuch value will be maintained at any subsequent date or is realizable\nin actual transactions. We should make clear that we have not made\na physical inspection of the Vessel, nor we have inspected the Vessel’s\nclassification records, but we have assumed for the purposes of\nthis Valuation, that the Vessel is in good and seaworthy condition\nwith her class fully maintained free of recommendations, with reasonably\ngood survey status and that she conforms in all respects with the\nrequirements of her Registry. We believe that the above valuation is\nreasonably accurate, but all statements made above are statements\nof opinion and are not to be taken as representations of fact. Any\nperson who is contemplating entering a transaction, or other legal\nprocess relative to this Vessel or her value, should satisfy himself,\nby inspection of the Vessel or any other appropriate means, as to\nthe correctness of the statements and assumptions which the valuation contains.\nAny variation from the above factors could substantially affect\nthe value. This Valuation has been provided in good\nfaith solely for the private use of the person who commissioned\nit, and is not for publication and/or circulation. … [emphasis in original in bold; emphasis\nadded in italics] 17     Mr\nYap in his written submissions also mentioned that the court had an\nindependent valuation of the Vessel. This submission is misguided. Throughout\nthe proceedings, the parties had relied on US$16m as the value of\nthe Vessel. This figure came from Mr Kwek’s affidavit and was purportedly\nsupported by Golden Destiny’s certification. There was no other\nindependent valuation disclosed to the court. Mr Kwek had applied for\nan order to appraise the Vessel but this was soon after the court\nhad indicated on 6 January 2014 that it was going to adjourn SUM\n6520. As far as this court was concerned, the appointment of Insight\nMarine Services Pte Ltd (“Insight”) was made in connection with\nprayer 3 of SUM 6520 and was being sought early in the event the\nBank’s application for a direct sale was not allowed, and the sale\nwas to be made by public auction or private treaty pursuant to O\n70 of the Rules of Court. It is well known to maritime law practitioners\nthat the Sheriff only consults the appraiser’s valuation after all sealed\nbids have been received following an order to advertise and sell\nthe vessel. Until then, the appraiser’s valuation, which is received\nby the Sheriff in a sealed envelope, would not be opened. As was\nthe case here, Insight’s valuation which the Sheriff received was\nin a sealed envelope was unopened. As I previously held inTheTurtle Bayat\n[18], the amount of the appraisal would not be revealed to the public\nin order to preserve the integrity of the judicial sale process. 18     The\nevidential gap arising from Golden Destiny’s valuation certificate as\nstated in [16] above effectively undermined the Bank’s application\nfor a salependente lite. Evidence\nof the expenses of maintaining a vessel under arrest and the value\nof the vessel must be present before the court. In the absence of\nsuch evidence, the court cannot decide if the vessel under arrest is\nor is likely to be a wasting asset if it is not sold before judgment\nis obtained against the shipowner. Mr Kwek identified ongoing expenses\nsuch as the crew wages of the 21 Filipino crew at US$13,673.75 per\nweek, port charges and guard charges incurred for the period of\n30 October 2013 to 20 December 2013 amounting to S$144,070.60 and\nS$25,680 respectively, and the usual port charges of S$4,477.87\nand security guard charges of S$513.60 which are being incurred\ndaily. However, the evidence before the court remains incomplete\nwithout a proper valuation of the Vessel. 19     In\naddition, I agree with AR Lee that there was nothing in writing from\nOkeanos stating its willingness or readiness to purchase the Vessel\nat US$17.5m and on the Sheriff’s terms and conditions. The affidavit\nin support of the direct sale which was deposed by Mr Kwek stated\nthat Okeanos would “apply to purchase the Vessel” directly from\nthe Sheriff.[note: 6]In another\nparagraph, Mr Kwek deposed that Okeanos had offered to purchase\nthe Vessel at a price of US$17.5m.[note: 7]There\nwas no indication at all as to whom the offer was made, which is\nan important consideration seeing that SUM 6520 was the Bank’s application\nfor an order that Okeanos buys the Vessel in a direct judicial sale\nfrom the Sheriff at US$17.5m. Evidentially speaking, the purported\nbuyer’s offer itself and the terms of the offer were uncertain.\nIt was not clear whether there was a buyer ready and willing to commit\nto a purchase of the Vessel on the usual Sheriff’s terms and conditions. 20     I\nalso note that the inspiration to find a buyer prepared to carry\nthe cargo to China started from a conversation Mr Kwek had with\nthe representative of Swissmarine’s P&I Club. Okeanos is the\nsubsidiary of a customer of the Bank. There was no evidence and\nit was not the Bank’s case that it had casted the net wider in search\nof more interested parties to attract the best price for the Vessel\n(see [8]–[9]).",
        "The Nel": "21     The\nBank, the Intervener and the Charterers relied onThe\nNelto persuade the court to depart from the normal course\nof commissioning the Sheriff to appraise and sell the vessel because\nof the existence of “powerful special features” or “special circumstances”\n(seeThe Turtle Bayat [29]). InTheNel,\nthe arrested vessel had a cargo of sulphur on board that was shipped\nfrom Vancouver on a voyage to Tunisa. The mortgagee had US$12m secured\non the vessel. The cost of off-loading the sulphur on board at Vancouver\nwas estimated to be US$1.3m. As an alternative, the mortgagee sought\nto privately sell the vessel for US$5m to a buyer who was willing\nto carry the cargo to its destination. The mortgagee obtained valuations\nof US$4m and US$3.75m for the vessel. 22     What\nwas extraordinary inThe Nelwas\nthe cargo of sulphur. When sulphur comes into contact with moisture,\na chemical reaction is triggered resulting in the potentially devastating\n(and dangerous) effect of corroding the steel of a vessel. On the\nfacts, the court found that there was a real likelihood of the vessel\nbeing corroded (The Nelat [10]): 10    …\nIn addition to the sulphur being aboard the vessel for some six weeks\nhere at Vancouver with, as I have said, warmer than usual temperatures,\nshe still had to complete her voyage. A usual voyage from Vancouver\nto Tunisia, not taking into account delays at the Panama Canal and\ndelays in discharge at Tunisia, would take about 26 days assuming\na speed of 15 knots. Taking into account that most of the voyage\nfrom Vancouver, through the Panama Canal and to Tunisia would take\nplace in sub-tropical and tropical climates, the concern of a corrosive\nreaction, between steel plate and wet sulphur, was a real and valid\nconcern. … 23     The\ncourt inThe Nelobserved that should\nthere be corrosion the vessel’s seaworthiness would be affected,\nthus making it difficult to sell at a good price (at [15]). In that\ncase, there was evidence that the vessel “could well, within weeks\nand certainly within months, become unsaleable except as scrap or\nat a minimal speculative price” (The Nelat\n[16]). The consequence of that was the likelihood of a smaller pool\nof sale proceeds available for distribution toin\nremcreditors. In light of the very special circumstances,\nthe court granted the salependente liteto\na buyer who was prepared to carry the cargo to its destination. 24     The\nother point inThe Nelrelated to\nthe high costs of discharging the cargo. This same feature was raised\nby the Intervener and the Charterers. Mr Yap submitted that the\ncost of discharging the cargo in this case would be substantial,\nthereby reducing the sale proceeds available toin\nremcreditors. Mr Kwek relied onThe\nNelat [21] which stated as follows: … To deny a sale at this point would result\nin substantial expenses to remove cargo and/or the certainty, in\nthe future, of a substantially lower sale price of a ship suspect\nof sulphur corrosion damage.In either eventthe\nproceeds available toin remcreditors\nwould be smaller. This result is contrary to the objective of any\ncourt ordered sale, that of obtaining the best fair price for the ship\nin order to protect creditors. Thus the approval of the private\nsale of the “Nel” by way of an order\nand a commission for sale. [emphasis added] 25     It\nappears that in granting the application, Prothonotary Hargrave\nJ inThe Nelconsidered the costs\nof discharging the cargo from the arrested vessel as part of the\nSheriff’s expenses to be paid out of the proceeds of the sale of\nthe vessel. I will go on to show that — in the present case at least\n— this proposition appears to be inaccurate in that the costs of\ndischarging the cargo is not part of Sheriff’s expenses and as such\nthe high costs of discharge is not a relevant factor to allow a\ndirect sale. 26     Interestingly,\nProthonotary Hargrave J in a subsequent decision ofRoyal\nBank of Scotland plc. v. Kimisis III(The)[1999]\nF.C.J. No. 300 (“Kimisis III”),\nheld inobiter dictathat the Canadian\nposition as to whether such expenses should fall upon the cargo\ninterests or the Sheriff was actually still open to debate: 13    While\nthe affidavit of Mr. Leo Murphy does perhaps raise a question as to\nwhether the Plaintiff is taking any undue advantage by indicating\nto a potential purchaser of the Kimisis III that it was not possible\nto arrange a sale of the vessel with cargo aboard and that it was\nnot interested in such a transaction, there may well be another\nside to the proposal of Curzon Maritime Ltd. to purchase the Kimisis\nIII and carry Noga’s cargo to its destination. It would be best\nfor all concerned if that possibility were dealt with further, certainly\nby the Plaintiff and perhaps also by Noga, if it is able to develop\nfurther material given more time.However,\nI do not need to make a finding, at this point, as to whether the\ncost of discharging cargo should fall upon the cargo owner, the\ngeneral rule under English law, or whether the cost of discharge\nof cargo should be a Marshall’s expense in getting the ship ready for\nsale, the American approach, or whether equitable considerations,\nas suggested by Mr. Justice Cons in The Mingren Development, ought\nto apply.[emphasis added] 27     Since\nthen, the Federal Court of Canada inCameco\nCorp. v. “MCP Altona” (The)(2013) 225 A.C.W.S. (3d)\n292 (“MCP Altona”) held that the costs\nof discharge fall on the cargo owner and was not a Marshal’s expense. Sean\nHarrington J reviewed a number of decisions including the English cases\n(which adopt the position that such costs are to be borne by cargo interests),\nAmerican cases (which adopt the position that such costs are to be\npaid out of the proceeds of sale), and the previous Federal Court\nof Canada decision ofKimisis III,\nbefore arriving at the following conclusion (at [44]): 44    I\nam more persuaded by the English and Hong Kong authorities and hold\nthat the cost of discharging the cargo of uranium and cleaning the\nship, assuming the contract was frustrated due to a breach of contract\non the part of the carrier, forms part of Cameco’s cargo claim,\nand is not to be equated with marshal’s expenses. This is not to\nsay that in this particular case the exercise of equitable discretion\nmight not give Cameco priority over the mortgage. 28     As\nalluded to inKimisis IIIandMCP Altona, English law places the burden\nof such costs on the cargo interests for the following reasons observed\nby Sheen J inThe Jogoo[1981] 1\nWLR 1376 (“The Jogoo”) at 1380: At the forefront of Mr. Mance’s submissions\non behalf of the mortgagees he invited me to consider the contractual\nrelationship between the cargo-owners and the ship-owners. The cargo\nwas carried inJogoounder a contract\nof carriage, one of the terms of which was that freight was pre-paid\nat Mombasa. When freight is paid in advance the cargo-owners accept\nthe commercial risk that the voyage will not be completed for whatever\nreason. If the contract is frustrated the cargo-owners bear the\nloss because the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act 1943 does\nnot apply to contracts for the carriage of goods by sea: see section\n2 (5)(a). The ship-owners repudiated\nthe contract of carriage by failing to pay their creditors or put\nup security in order to obtain the release from arrest of their\nvessel, with the result that the cargo-owners now have claims for\ndamages against them. The cargo-owners have a right to remove their\ncargo from the ship, or they may abandon it. 29     For\nsimilar reasons, the Supreme Court of Hong Kong adopted the English\nposition inDharamdas & Co. (Nigeria) Ltd.\nand another v. The Owners of the Ship or Vessel “Mingren Development”and Panasia Realty & Finance Ltd[1979]\nHKCU 19 (“Mingren Development”).\nI find it useful to recite the following passage by Cons J: It seems to me that the English position\nderives from the old common law doctrine of frustration. American\ncourts have approached from a different direction. They appear to\nlook at it this way, that from the moment of its arrest a ship is\na common fund administered by the court for the common benefit of\nall those interested in the fund and that any expenses incurred\nin the administration of that fund should be borne by the fund itself\nas an “expense of justice”. These may include wharf dues:The Poznan[1927] AMC 723 or the cost\nof discharging cargo to make a vessel more easily disposed of by\nsale:The Emilia[1963] AMC 1447.\nHowever this approach has not been without its critics:Gilmore and Black Admiralty Law, 2nd edition,\np. 603. Obviously there is no perfect solution. Financial disaster,\nlike any other disaster at sea, is likely to cause suffering to\nthe innocent. The argument that the suffering should fall primarily\nupon the mortgagee I find largely emotional. It is true that he\nmay sometimes have a free choice of when and where he arrest the\nship and may thus be able to lessen the impact on others. But so\nsometimes do other claimants. And no one can, as a general rule,\nbe blamed for exercising his rights at such time as he thinks most\npropitious to himself. If he takes undue advantage in any particular\ncircumstance the court may take that into account against him when\nexercising its discretion. The present position is of long standing.\nAs I see it the position was confirmed in 1943 when contracts for\nthe carriage of goods by sea were deliberately excluded from the\noperation of the Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts) Act. I am not\npersuaded that the American approach is so much more just or that conditions\nnow are so different from those in 1943 that I should take it on myself\nto make a general change. 30     In\nthe present case, the Vessel, and not its cargo, was under arrest. The\nintervener who asserts rights over the cargo would have to off-load\nthe cargo at its expense, and not at the Sheriff’s expense. This\nwould be the position unless the equities of the case justify treating\nthe costs of discharge as Sheriff’s expenses (seeThe\n“Nagasaki Spirit”[1994] 2 SLR(R) 165 at [30]). 31     It\nbears mentioning that courts inThe JogooandMingren Developmentappeared to be largely\npersuaded by their respective Law Reform (Frustrated Contracts)\nAct which expressly excluded contracts for carriage of goods by\nsea. I note parenthetically that the position in Singapore under\nthe Frustrated Contracts Act (Cap 115, 1985 Rev Ed) (“the Act”)\nis no different, as s 3(5)(a) expressly\nprovides that the Act does not apply to “any charterparty, except\na time charterparty or a charterparty by way of demise, or to any\ncontract (other than a charterparty) for the carriage of goods by\nsea”. However, since this point was not argued by any of the counsel,\nand is likely to arise on another occasion, I will say no more in\nthis decision. 32     For\nnow, the assertion that the costs of discharging the cargo would eat\ninto the eventual sale proceeds as argued by counsel is irrelevant\nto the determination of whether to grant a direct salependente litefor the reasons stated above.",
        "Other factors": "33     Mr\nYap also referred to the impossibility of landing the cargo in Singapore\nand that transhipping the cargo would be slow and costly. The issues\nof scheduling and timing of the transhipment vessel (assuming one was\navailable) and deterioration of the cargo were raised. He therefore contended\nthat the Bank’s application for direct judicial sale would be in\nthe best interests of everyone concerned. 34     In\nmany cases of arrest of cargo-laden vessels, the voyage is typically abandoned\nwhen the owner of the arrested vessel does not or is unable financially\nto put up security to lift the arrest. Cargo interests would have\nto step forward to recover possession of the cargo from the owner\nof the vessel. In this case, as stated above at [30], it is the\nVessel that was under arrest and not its cargo. The alleged “special\ncircumstances” are in reality a typical consequence of an arrest\nof a cargo-laden vessel. Just as the costs of discharge of cargo\ndo not fall automatically under Sheriff’s expenses, transhipment\nexpenses for the same reasons stated above should not be treated\nas Sheriff’s expenses to be paid out from the sale proceeds. In\nthe final analysis, such costs are, in principle, claims for breach\nof the contract of carriage against the vessel owners and/or the\ncharterers. 35     The\nfacts inTheUnion\nGoldare also different from the facts of the present\ncase. InThe Union Gold, Teare J\nsanctioned the direct sale of “an elderly vessel” built in 1984\nwhich was “unlikely to attract many buyers” (at [24]). The vessel\nin question was valued at only €315,000. The court there found it\ncompelling that the proposed buyer in that case offered to buy the vessel\nbecause it was in a position whereby he was able to retain and operate a\nlong term contract which provides business for her (and other vessels).\nIf that contract was lost, the proposed buyer would not be willing\nto buy the vessel. The court also took into consideration the fact\nthat the jobs of 21 crew members would be lost. In those unique\ncircumstances, the court came to the conclusion that the vessel\nwould probably fetch a higher price through a direct private sale\nthan it would through a public auction. In the present case, while\nOkeanos has offered to employ the crew members of the Vessel, that\nby itself does not constitute a “special circumstance”. UnlikeThe Union Gold, the present case by no\nmeans concerns a very old vessel. The Vessel was built in 2001.\nThe Defendant’s forecast to the Bank in June 2013 stated that the\nVessel was capable of trading until December 2017. There was no\nurgency to recoup whatever value remaining in the Vessel.",
        "Conclusion": "36     For\nthe reasons stated, prayer 2 of the Bank’s application for the direct sale\nof the Vesselpendente litewas\ndismissed. Without satisfactory evidence as to her value, the Bank’s\nassertion that the value of the security represented by the Vessel\nwould be progressively reduced by the costs of maintaining her under\narrest was not made out. I therefore did not grant prayer 2a for\na salependente lite.  [note: 1]Eric\nMullen’s affidavit filed on 24 January 2014 at para 21.
