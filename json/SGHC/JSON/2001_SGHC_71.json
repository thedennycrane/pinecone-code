        "B. PRINCIPLES OF NATURAL JUSTICE": "15.    At the outset, it ought to be reiterated that domestic\n\ntribunals such as STCs inquiry panel are required to observe the cardinal principles of natural\n\njustice. The most important of these are that the accused should be given reasonable notice of the\n\ncharge to be brought against him and that he should be given an opportunity to defend himself.\n\nHowever, when considering the application of the principles of natural justice in the context of\n\ndomestic tribunals, the following words of Pilcher J inDavies v Carew-Pole and Ors[1956] 1 WLR 833,840 ought to be borne in mind:Domestic tribunals of this kind are entitled to act in a way which would not be\n\n  permissible on the part of local justices sitting as a court of law. The requirement of natural\n\n  justice must depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under\n\n  which the tribunal is acting, the subject matter that is being dealt with, and so forth.16.    In similar vein, inRussell v Duke of Norfolk & Ors[1949] 1 All ER 109, 118, Tucker LJ said as follows:There are, in my view, no words which are of universal application to every\n\n  kind of inquiry and every kind of domestic tribunal. The requirements of natural justice must\n\n  depend on the circumstances of the case, the nature of the inquiry, the rules under which the\n\n  tribunal is acting, the subject-matter that is being dealt with, and so forth. Accordingly, I do\n\n  not derive much assistance from the definitions of natural justice which have been from time to\n\n  time used, but, whatever standard is adopted, one essential is that the person concerned should\n\n  have a reasonable opportunity of presenting his case.Tucker LJs view was endorsed by Lord Guest inWiseman v Borneman[1971] AC 297, by Lord Morris of Borth-y-Gest inFurnell v Whangarei High Schools Board[1973] AC\n\n660, and by Lord Slynn inRees v Crane[1994] 1 All ER 833.17.    Admittedly, a layman would be somewhat disadvantaged\n\nwithout the assistance of a lawyer at an inquiry such as the one conducted by STCs Stipendiary\n\nStewards on 23 August 2000 but this is an inevitable result of having domestic tribunals. InDavies v Carew-Pole & Ors[1956] 1 WLR 833,839-840, Pilcher J put the matter in its\n\nproper perspective when he said as follows:A layman at an inquiry of this kind is, of course, at a grave disadvantage\n\n  compared with the trained advocate, but that is a necessary result of these domestic tribunals\n\n  which proceed in a somewhat informal manner. Counsel for the plaintiff, in the course of his\n\n  forceful argument in this point, again and again said: \"What would be said of local justices\n\n  who acted in this way?\" With all due respect, the position is totally different. This matter\n\n  is not to be judged by the standards applicable to local justices.18.    The sensible approach adopted by Pilcher J inDavies v\n\nCarew-Pole & Orsand by Tucker LJ inRussell v Duke of Norfolk & Orswill be\n\nfollowed for the purpose of determining whether STCs inquiry panel observed the rules of natural\n\njustice in Mr Angs case.1.WHETHER THERE WAS SUFFICIENT NOTICE OF THE INQUIRY19.    Mr Ang had three complaints about the notice of the inquiry\n\nwhich he received on 22 August 2000. First, he contended that he was not given adequate notice of\n\nthe inquiry, which was scheduled for the very next day. Secondly, he said that he was given no\n\nnotice of the charges faced by him at the inquiry. Thirdly, he asserted that the notice of the\n\ninquiry that was served on him was only in respect of the circumstances surrounding his possession\n\nof prohibited items. As such, he claimed that he was given no notice that the administering of\n\nprohibited medication to the four horses would also be discussed at the inquiry.(a)Adequacy of notice of the inquiry20.    Mr Angs complaint that he was given one days notice\n\nof the inquiry would, without more, have merited serious consideration. However, the short notice\n\nmust be viewed in the context of offences relating to horse racing and the nature of an inquiry\n\nconducted by STC.21.    The integrity of horse racing and public confidence in\n\nhorse racing are utmost in the minds of turf clubs. An inquiry into complaints of doping,\n\nadministering of prohibited substances to horses and possession of prohibited items must be\n\nconducted swiftly as race events are held on a very regular basis. Mr Fisher said that but for the\n\nfact that the prohibited items were seized from Mr Ang on a race day, when officials of the club\n\nwere preoccupied with the races, an inquiry might have been held even earlier.22.    The precise nature of an inquiry conducted by turf clubs,\n\nsuch as STC, must be taken into account when considering whether an accused trainer has been given\n\nsufficient notice of the inquiry. STC carries out investigations into allegations of misconduct on\n\nthe part of trainers primarily through an inquiry. Such an inquiry is merely thebeginningof\n\nthe formal stage of investigating an allegation that a trainer has done something wrong. At the\n\ninitial stage of such an inquiry, all that is required of a trainer who has been summoned to appear\n\nbefore the inquiry panel is that he offer an explanation with respect to his alleged misconduct.\n\nWhen referring to an inquiry into the misconduct of a horse trainer inRussell v Duke of Norfolk\n\nand Ors[1949] 1 All ER 109, 117, Tucker LJ explained:In dealing with this matter, I think it is essential to appreciate the precise\n\n  nature of the inquiry. The horse is said to have been doped. The stewards have evidence which\n\n  satisfies them that there is aprima faciecase of doping. They require the trainer  to\n\n  attend the inquiry and to give an explanation. If in the course of that explanation, it is made\n\n  manifest that there has been negligence or misconduct, a specific charge then emerges.23.    Viewed in such a light and considering the urgency with\n\nwhich allegations of misconduct on the part of horse trainers must be investigated, the fact that an\n\ninquiry has been commenced at very short notice does not, by itself, mean that the rules of natural\n\njustice relating to notice have not been followed. Much depends on whether the accused trainer has\n\nindeed been prejudiced by the short notice of the inquiry.24.    The fact that an STC inquiry is merely the beginning of the\n\nformal investigation into an alleged wrong and that an accused horse trainer, such as Mr Ang, has\n\nample opportunities to seek an adjournment of the inquiry if they feel that they have had\n\ninsufficient notice of the inquiry to be able to present their case effectively must be borne in\n\nmind. To begin with, the notice which Mr Ang received on 22 August 2000 specifically provided that\n\nif he was unable to attend the inquiry due to exceptional circumstances, he was to inform the\n\nStipendiary Stewards Department at the earliest opportunity. In such a case, a new date for the\n\ninquiry would be fixed if there are circumstances to warrant this.25.    Even after the commencement of the inquiry, Mr Angs\n\nright to call witnesses was not prejudiced by the speed with which the inquiry was commenced. He\n\ncould have sought an adjournment of the inquiry for a variety of reasons, including the calling of\n\nwitnesses who were unable to be present at the hearing on 23 August 2000. This was confirmed by Mr\n\nFisher, who said as follows during cross-examination and in reply to a question posed by me:Q. How can you expect witnesses to be called at such short notice?A. If he wanted to call witnesses who were unavailable, we would adjourn the\n\n  hearing to another date unless this was a delaying tactic.I do not recall an occasion where\n\n  we have refused such a request.Ct. Can you confirm that you have adjourned inquiry hearings to another day\n\n  because the accused wanted to call witnesses?A.Yes, quite often.(emphasis added)26.    Furthermore, if Mr Ang had not admitted his guilt, the\n\ninquiry hearing might have had to be adjourned to another date. Evidently, the STC panel of\n\nStipendiary Stewards knew this when they commenced the inquiry on 23 August 2000. For instance, if\n\nMr Ang, who knew that he had a right to insist that samples of his horses urine be sent to an\n\nindependent laboratory in another country for testing, had insisted that this be done, the inquiry\n\nhearing would have had to be postponed until after the relevant test results had been obtained.27.    What is thus of utmost importance in this case is that Mr\n\nAng was not prejudiced at all by the short notice of the inquiry. He cannot claim to have been\n\nsurprised by the speed with which the inquiry of 23 August 2000 was arranged as he was fully aware\n\nof the speed with which STCs inquiries are arranged. In a previous inquiry into another breach\n\ncommitted by him, which was held only one month earlier in July 2000, he was also given only one days\n\nnotice of the inquiry. He thus knew on 19 August 2000, the day he was caught with prohibited items\n\nand was informed that his horses had failed tests, that an inquiry would be held at any moment in\n\nrelation to his possession of prohibited items and the finding that four of his horses had been\n\ninjected with a prohibited substance.28.    In truth, Mr Ang, who was expecting an inquiry to be held\n\nat a moments notice, had given much thought to his case. He had consulted Dr Brian Stewart, STCs\n\nveterinary surgeon about his case and about the nature of Eltenac, the prohibited substance found in\n\nhis horses. He had also laid the ground work for a mitigation plea by lobbying both Mr Fisher and Dr\n\nSteward to help him wherever possible. If he had wanted to, he would have called his witnesses to be\n\nready for an inquiry at short notice. When cross-examined, he did not deny that he could have\n\napproached his witnesses between 19 August 2000 and 23 August 2000. He said as follows:Q. Between 19 and 23 August 2000, did you approach any one to be a witness?A. No.Q. You knew at the inquiry, you were entitled to call witnesses?A. Yes .Q. You told the inquiry panel that it was unnecessary to call witnesses.A. Yes, at that time.29.    After careful thought, Mr Ang decided that the best\n\nstrategy for him to adopt at the inquiry was to admit the offences and hope that he would be\n\npunished with only a fine. It is patently clear that he had no intention whatsoever of denying his\n\nguilt at the inquiry. He confirmed this when he said as follows during cross-examination:Q. Were you not given the opportunity to say you did not personally administer\n\n  Telzenac to the horses?A. Is it not clear to you that I was just agreeing to every question. I was\n\n  trying to take the rap. Finish everything, hope to get a fine. I hoped that when I admit to\n\n  everything, I will get a fine. That was all I was hoping for.30.    In view of his decision to admit his guilt, he did not wish\n\nto call any witnesses. At p 65 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:Chairman: Any witnesses you would like to call in?Trainer Ang: No need sir because theres no need to implicate anybody else\n\n  because I am responsible Sir.31.    When cross-examined, Mr Ang confirmed that he did not\n\nintend to call any witness for the inquiry. His answers were as follows:Q. You wanted to get the inquiry over and done with and you did not intend to call witnesses at\n\n  the inquiry.A. Thats about it.32.    Since Mr Ang had made up his mind to plead guilty in the\n\nhope that his forthright admission of guilt will persuade the inquiry panel to be more lenient to\n\nhim, he cannot claim to have been prejudiced by the short notice of the inquiry. In view of this and\n\nthe fact that he could, if he had wanted more time, have sought an adjournment of the inquiry in\n\norder to call witnesses, read reports or to await the results of tests demanded by him, his\n\nassertion that the inquiry proceedings should be set aside on the ground of inadequacy of notice of\n\nthe inquiry is thus rejected.(b)No notice of charges33.    Mr Angs next complaint was that before the inquiry\n\nhearing, he received no notice of the charges which he had to face at the inquiry. In regard to such\n\na complaint in the context of horse racing, the following passage from Tucker LJs judgment inRussell\n\nv Duke of Norfolk and Ors[1949] 1 All ER 109, 117, part of which has been cited earlier on in\n\nthis judgment, ought to be borne in mind:It does not seem to me that at the outset there is necessarily any particular\n\n  charge made against the trainer. If in the course of [the trainers] explanation, it is made\n\n  manifest that there has been negligence or misconduct, a specific charge then emerges, and that is\n\n  exactly what happened in the present case. It was an inquiry in the course of which it emerged\n\n  that there were matters for which the stewards held the trainer responsible.34.    In short, the adversarial system, under which the\n\nprosecution is deemed to have completed its investigation before proceeding to court, has no place\n\nin the inquiry conducted by STCs Stipendiary Stewards on 23 August 2000. In fact, inRussell v\n\nDuke of Norfolk and Ors, Tucker LJ rightly added at p 117 that it would be a mistake to regard\n\nthe proceedings in a domestic tribunal as if they were prosecutions with a prosecutor and a\n\ndefendant.35.    I endorse Tucker LJ words. In this case, in view of the\n\nSecurity Departments report and the fact that four of Mr Angs horses had been found to have\n\nbeen administered a prohibited medication, there was a prima facie case against him. If evidence is\n\nfound in the course of the inquiry that Mr Ang had committed an offence, a specific charge would\n\nthen emerge.36.    In any case, Mr Ang knew what he would be charged with. He\n\nknew that it is an offence to be found with prohibited medication. He also knew that it is an\n\noffence to administer a prohibited drug or medication to a horse. During the course of the trial, he\n\nrepeated on several occasions that he was aware that under the MRA Rules of Racing, a horse trainer\n\nis deemed to be fully informed and aware of the consequence of any medication or substance\n\nadministered to a horse under his charge. Surely, he must have been aware, before the inquiry, that\n\nit is an offence to administer the prohibited substance to the horse himself. In short, he was not\n\nprejudiced at all by the lack of specific charges because he had a very good idea of the charges\n\nwhich could be filed against him. In the circumstances, Mr Angs complaint that he received no\n\nnotice of the charges is dismissed.(c)Whether the second, third, fourth and fifth charges should have been the subject of\n\nanother inquiry37.    Mr Ang next contended that only the first charge, relating\n\nto possession of prohibited items, was relevant to the inquiry and that the remaining four charges\n\nrelating to the administering of Telzenac to the four horses should not have been dealt with by the\n\ninquiry panel on 23 August 2000. This is because the notice of the inquiry given to him on 22 August\n\ndid not mention anything about the administering of Telzenac to the four horses. It merely stated as\n\nfollows:You are officially informed that you are required to appear before the\n\n  Stipendiary Stewards of the Singapore Turf Club on Wed 23 August 2000 at 1 pmto attend an\n\n  inquiry relating to prohibited items seized from you at SNTC on Sat 19 August 2000.(emphasis added)38.    When questioned about the prohibited items seized from him\n\non 19 August 2000, Mr Ang admitted not only that he had prohibited items in his possession but also\n\nthat he personally administered Telzenac to the four horses. As such, although investigations into\n\nthe presence of a prohibited substance in the four horses were still going on, the inquiry panel saw\n\nit fit in the face of Mr Angs unequivocal admission of guilt to press four additional charges\n\nagainst him for breaching MRA Rule 200(5), which provides as follows:200. Any person  who ..(5) shall administer or cause to be administered to a horse which has been\n\n    entered for a race any prohibited substance, internally or by hypodermic or other methods .may be disqualified, and such disqualification, if imposed, shall take effect\n\n    as from the date of the offence or from such other date as the Committee of the Associated Club\n\n    or Stewards may determine.39.    The second charge against Mr Ang concerned his\n\nadministering of Telzenac to the horse,\"Star Dragon\".It was in the following\n\nterms:Now the Stewards are charging you under [MRA Rule 200(5)] in that on your own\n\n  admission, you, Trainer Ang, administered a prohibited substance, namely \"Telzenac\", to\n\n  the horse, \"STAR DRAGON\", which was entered for and subsequently ran in Race 2 at\n\n  the Singapore Turf Club Meeting on 12 August 2000 and a post-race urine sample taken from that\n\n  horse confirmed the presence of Eltenac, a non steroidal anti-inflammatory and prohibited\n\n  substance under the MRA Rules, thereby contravening MRA Rule 203(b).40.    The third, fourth and fifth charges concerned his\n\nadministering of Telzenac to the other three horses, \"Sky Warrior\", \"Crystal\n\nChilavert\"and\"Prinz Oskar\"respectively.41.    For the purpose of considering whether the second, third,\n\nfourth and fifth charges ought to have been pressed against Mr Ang at the inquiry on 23 August 2000,\n\nthe following words of Pilcher J inDavis v Carew-Pole & Ors[1956] 1 WLR 833, 839, are\n\nworth noting:The mere fact  that the accused person has not in a particular case been\n\n  given formal notice of all the matters in which his conduct is to be called in question does not,\n\n  in my view, necessarily entitle him to contend successfully that the proceedings of a tribunal\n\n  consisting of fair-minded and honest laymen were not conducted in accordance with the principles\n\n  of natural justice.42.    InDavis v Carew-Pole & Ors, the plaintiff, a\n\nstable keeper, was required to attend a meeting of the stewards of the National Hunt Committee to\n\ninquire into an allegation that he, as an unlicensed trainer, had trained a horse, namedKings\n\nHenrys Road,for a steeplechase in contravention of the National Hunt Rules. During\n\nthe course of the inquiry, his alleged activities in connection with the training of two other\n\nhorses, namedPrince BalboandBelljinks,were considered. There was no doubt that the\n\nplaintiff had not received any prior notification that his activities in connection with the\n\ntraining ofPrince BalboorBelljinkswere also to be the subject of the inquiry. At\n\nthe end of the inquiry, the stewards were satisfied that he should have been aware of the relevant\n\nregulations and declared him a disqualified person. Pilcher J said at p 840:It may well be in the present case that, although not formally notified of the\n\n   alleged [offence regardingPrince Balbo] and the alleged offence in regard to [Belljinks],\n\n  the plaintiff had a shrewd suspicion that those matters would be inquired into. In any event, as I\n\n  say,no fact was in dispute in relation to these other mattersand in the circumstances of\n\n  the present case I am not prepared to hold, as a matter of law  that the plaintiff is entitled\n\n  to succeed in his contention that the inquiry was not held in accordance with the principles of\n\n  natural justice,because I do not think that the plaintiff was, on the facts of the case,\n\n  prejudiced by the lack of notice.(emphasis added)43.    In the above-mentioned case, Pilcher J laid great emphasis\n\non the fact that in relation to the other matters raised at the inquiry, no facts were in dispute,\n\nand that the accused was not prejudiced by the discussion on the additional matters. The present\n\ncase is similar toDavis v Carew-Pole & Ors.In the present case, the facts relating to\n\nthe second, third, fourth and fifth charges, which concern the administering of Telzenac to the four\n\nhorses, were also not in dispute because he admitted his guilt.44.    Furthermore, Mr Ang must have had, what Pilcher J termed, a\n\n\"shrewd suspicion\" that the matters relating to the administering of Telzenac to the four\n\nhorses would also be raised at the inquiry on 23 August 2000. That was why after having been told\n\nthat there would be an inquiry on the following day relating to prohibited items seized from him on\n\n19 August 2000, Mr Ang wrote to Mr Fisher on 22 August 2000 as follows:My only hope is that you can help me as far as you can, not to take away my\n\n  Trainers licence in the final outcome of my casesinvolving the four horses.(emphasis added)45.    In any case, in an inquiry with respect to the prohibited\n\nitems seized from Mr Ang, a relevant question must surely relate to what he did with the prohibited\n\nitems. He admitted without any qualification whatsoever, that he administered Telzenac to the four\n\nhorses. The validity of his guilty plea will be considered later on. All that needs to be stated\n\nhere is that in the face of his unqualified admission of guilt, the Stipendiary Stewards were\n\nentitled to frame charges against him in relation to the administering of the substances to the four\n\nhorses. As such, his contention that there was a breach of the rules of natural justice when the\n\nsecond, third, fourth and fifth charges were framed at the inquiry on 23 August 2000 cannot be\n\ncountenanced.",
        "(2)REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD": "46.    As has been mentioned, one of the cardinal principles of\n\nnatural justice is that the accused must be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard.47.    There is no doubt that Mr Ang was given a reasonable\n\nopportunity to be heard. Mr Fishers opening statement at the beginning of the inquiry hearing and\n\nMr Angs reply were recorded at p 1 of the notes of the inquiry as follows:Chairman: You may call any witnesses to the Inquiry and make any statements to\n\n  the Stewards and you can present any evidence that you wish. You can question any evidence or\n\n  witnesses that the Stipendiary Stewards might introduce. Do you understand the position and your\n\n  rights?Trainer Ang: Yes.Calling of witnesses48.    The fact that Mr Ang had the opportunity to call witnesses\n\nto testify at the inquiry but did not do so has already been considered. It must also be noted that\n\nhe was even afforded an opportunity to call witnesses to speak on his behalf after he pleaded guilty\n\nto the charges. At p 78 of the notes of the inquiry, the exchange of words between Mr Fisher and Mr\n\nAng was recorded as follows:Chairman: Mr Ang, are there any witnesses that you would like to call in to\n\n  speak on your behalf on mitigation?Trainer Ang: Not necessary, Sir.Opportunity to read reports49.    Mr Ang complained that before the inquiry, he was not given\n\nrelevant reports, such as the Security Departments report and the analysts report on the tests\n\non the four horses, for his perusal.50.    At the beginning of the inquiry, Mr Ang was invited to read\n\nthe Security Departments Report. Mr Fishers invitation and Mr Angs reply were recorded in\n\npp 2-3 of the notes of the inquiry in the following terms:Chairman: [S]ecurity has submitted a report to me, a copy of which I have here.\n\n  If you wish to see any part of the report, you may do so.Trainer Ang: No need, Sir.Chairman: I will be referring to extracts from it. However, you may see any\n\n  part of this as Ive referred to.Trainer Ang: Not necessary, Sir.51.    Later on in the inquiry, Mr Fisher again invited Mr Ang to\n\nread the entire report from the Security Department. At p 33 of the notes of the inquiry, the\n\nrelevant extract is as follows:Chairman: . Im offering you the chance to read the report in full.Trainer Ang: No need, no need; because they have found everything there.52.    Mr Ang paid attention to the parts of the Security\n\nDepartments report which were read to him at the inquiry. He said that notwithstanding what was\n\nstated in the report, he did not try to hide the brown bag containing the prohibited items. He did\n\nnot dispute the other parts of the report. Having opted not to view the report, he is in no position\n\nto assert that his right to see the Security Departments report has been infringed.53.    As for the analysts report on the finding of prohibited\n\nsubstances in the four horses, Mr Ang did not doubt the findings of the MRA laboratory. At the\n\ninquiry, he made this clear when he declined to insist on his right to have samples of the urine of\n\nthe four horses sent to another laboratory for testing. This will be discussed in greater detail\n\nlater on in this judgment.Questioning of STCs witnesses54.    Mr Ang was given the opportunity to question STCs\n\nwitnesses. To begin with, Mr Fisher invited Mr Ang to question Mr Lim from the Security Department.\n\nThis is evident from p 34 of the notes of the inquiry. The relevant extract is as follows:Chairman: Mr Ang, this report was submitted to me by Lim Ah Tee, from Security\n\n  Department . Are there any questions that you want to ask him regarding this report or the\n\n  content of this report.Trainer Ang: Only thing is, I did not try to hide the bag.Chairman: Is there anything you want to question him about these items?Trainer Ang: No, the items are there. Theres no need to question him .55.    Before the security officers left the premises, Mr Fisher\n\nasked Mr Ang once more whether he wanted to question anyone from the Security Department. Mr Ang\n\ndeclined to do so.56.    Mr Ang was also invited to question Dr Brian Stewart, STCs\n\nveterinary surgeon but he declined to do so. (See p 21 of the notes of the inquiry.)57.    In short, Mr Ang cannot complain that he was given no\n\nopportunity to defend himself by questioning STCs witnesses.Referee samples58.    To understand Mr Angs complaint in relation to the\n\nreferee samples, reference must be made to Rule 29 of the MRA Regulations, which provides as\n\nfollows:Rule 29.2When a urine sample is taken, it will be split into two samples, one sample\n\n  will be analysed by the MRA laboratory; the other to be held by the Associated Club where the\n\n  sample was taken.Rule 29.3.1Within seven (7) days of the trainer being notified of the presence of a\n\n  prohibited substance from a sample collected from a horse under his charge, the trainer may\n\n  request the referee sample be sent to one of the MRA approved laboratories. When despatching the\n\n  referee sample to the nominated laboratory, the associated Club shall ask the nominated laboratory\n\n  to confirm the presence of the prohibited substance found by the MRA laboratory in the first\n\n  sample.Rule 29.5All costs arising from the despatch of the referee sample to the nominated\n\n  laboratory shall be to the account of the trainer.59.    Mr Ang complained that after he made an oral request for\n\nthe referee samples of the urine of the four horses to be sent to an independent laboratory for\n\ntesting, STC failed to act on his request. In his statement of claim, he stated that STCs\n\nomission unfairly deprived him of vital evidence which might have showed that the MRA laboratorys\n\ntest results were flawed.60.    Mr Fisher said that as a trainer has to bear the cost of\n\nsuch a test, he asked trainers who require a referee sample to be sent to an independent laboratory\n\nfor testing to make their request in writing in order to avoid a dispute as to whether or not such a\n\nrequest has been made after the cost has already been incurred. Admittedly, the relevant rule does\n\nnot require a request to be made in writing but it was not difficult for Mr Ang to make his request\n\nin writing. In any case, Mr Fisher, who was fully aware of Mr Angs right to have the referee\n\nsample tested, asked him at the inquiry whether he still required the referee samples to be tested.\n\nThe following exchange of words between Mr Fisher and Mr Ang was recorded in p 43 of the notes of\n\nthe inquiry:Chairman: Im asking you now because those Inquiries were pending, your\n\n  decision on whether you wanted to send the referee samples away?Trainer Ang. No, not necessary, Sir.61.    When he was cross-examined, Mr Ang claimed that at the\n\ninquiry, he thought that the referee samples had already been sent for testing and that the inquiry\n\npanel had the test results. He said as follows:Q. At the inquiry, you were asked whether you wanted the referee samples to be\n\n  sent for testing?A. Yes.Q. You declined this offer because you knew that the prohibited substance in\n\n  your bag was Eltenac?A. I totally disagree. I was under the impression that my oral request was met\n\n  with. I thought that he had the results.62.    Mr Angs contention that he thought that the referee\n\nsamples had already been tested and that Mr Fisher had the results is absolutely untenable. He must\n\nhave known that if the samples had indeed been sent to a laboratory in another country for testing\n\nafter he made an oral request on the evening of 19 August 2000, which was a Saturday, the results\n\ncould not have been available on 23 August 2000. In any case, the following exchange of words\n\nbetween Mr Fisher and Mr Ang at p 43 of the notes of the inquiry puts paid to any suggestion that Mr\n\nAng could have been mistaken about whether the referee samples had already been sent away for\n\ntesting:Chairman: . So you had the Right within seven days.Do you still wish to\n\n  send those referee samples away?Trainer Ang: No, because if say is anti-inflammatory, it must be the substance\n\n  administered by myself. So, there is no need to doubt the Lab. I mean if were questioning the\n\n  integrity and the ..(emphasis added)63.    There is thus no doubt that even at the inquiry stage, Mr\n\nAng had the opportunity to have the referee samples sent for testing. Having not exercised his\n\nright, he has no grounds for complaining that the referee samples were not sent for testing.",
        "Mr Ang was given an opportunity to defend himself": "64.    In view of the fact that Mr Ang was given the opportunity\n\nto call witnesses, read the relevant reports, question STCs witnesses and insist that the referee\n\nsamples be sent to an independent laboratory, his assertion that he was not afforded an opportunity\n\nto defend himself is rejected.C. THE VALIDITY OF THE PLEA OF GUILT65.    At the inquiry on 23 August 2000, Mr Ang pleaded guilty to\n\nall the five charges. However, he asserted that his guilty plea was not valid.66.    InGanesun s/o Kannan v PP[1996] 3 SLR 560, 563,Yong Pung How CJ reiterated that a plea of guilt must be valid and unequivocal and that the\n\ncourt must ensure that it is the accused himself who wishes to plead guilty, that the accused\n\nunderstands the nature and consequences of his plea and that the accused intends to admit without\n\nqualification the offence he is alleged to have committed.67.    The evidence does not show that Mr Ang did not wish to\n\nplead guilty or that he did not understand the nature and consequences of his plea.68.    As for the first charge, which concerns the possession of\n\nprohibited items and drugs, Mr Ang clearly knew what he was doing when he pleaded guilty. To begin\n\nwith, he admitted that needles, syringes and prohibited medication were found on him. He also\n\nadmitted that the prohibited bottles of medication were his property. During cross-examination, he\n\nsaid as follows:Q. These items belonged to you.A. I did not deny they were my bottles.69.    At the inquiry, Mr Ang was given innumerable opportunities\n\nto deny that the prohibited items were his. Mr Fisher was cautious enough to ask him more than once\n\nwhether the said items belonged to him. His questions and Mr Angs replies, as recorded in p 34 of\n\nthe notes of the inquiry, are as follows:Chairman: Ill ask you once more, do you accept that these items as listed\n\n  here 1-8 were in your possession and in your brown bag?Trainer Ang: Yah, they were there, they were right in front of me. Theres no\n\n  denying it.Chairman: And you admit they, some of which, are prohibited substances?Trainer Ang: No denying, Im as guilty as it comes. Yes, Im not denying\n\n  that, Sir.70.    Mr Ang admitted his guilt again when he declined to\n\nquestion Mr Lim from the Security Department. At p 34 of the notes of the inquiry, the relevant\n\nquestions and answers are as follows:Chairman: Is there anything that you want to question [Mr Lim] about these\n\n  items?Trainer Ang: No, the items are there.Chairman: The concern we have is for these items and the possession.Trainer Ang: Because the items are there, no denying. No denying, Sir.71.    When questioned by Mr Rajendran, a member of the inquiry\n\npanel, Mr Ang again confirmed that he had the prohibited items in his possession. The relevant\n\nquestions and answers, as recorded in p 31 of the notes of the inquiry, are as follows:Mr Rajendran: Why would you ask [the security personnel] for the help?Trainer Ang: Because inside the bag was a lot of medication.Mr Rajendran: Which were prohibited, right?Trainer Ang: Some of them were prohibited.Mr Rajendran: [W]hat I am trying to establish is whether you knew that it was.Trainer Ang:If I did not, if I didnt know what it was, I wont ask him\n\n  to help.(emphasis added)72.    It is pertinent to note that when Mr Ang was questioned by\n\nthe police, he admitted that the prohibited items were in his possession. He confirmed this at the\n\ninquiry. At p 64 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:Chairman: And you accepted  and you also advised the police that you had\n\n  these items in your possession.Trainer Ang: Yes, yes, I told them, theres no denying.73.    When cross-examined, he also confirmed that he told the\n\npolice that he had the prohibited substances in his possession. He said as follows:Q. Did you advise the police that you administered the medication and you had\n\n  possession of them.A. Yes, I did.74.    Mr Arul contended that Mr Ang should not have been found\n\nguilty of possessing prohibited items because there was no proof that the bottles in question\n\ncontained prohibited medication. This argument ignores the fact that Mr Ang admitted that he had in\n\nhis possession needles and syringes, which are also prohibited items. In any case, as far as the\n\ncontents of the bottles of medication are concerned, Mr Ang did not deny that they were properly\n\nlabelled or that the contents therein were not the medication stated in the labels. When\n\ncross-examined, he said as follows:Q. Were the bottles properly labelled?A. I cannot deny that the labels were there.75.    As for the second, third, fourth and fifth charges which\n\nconcerned the administering of Telzenac to the four horses which had been entered for the race, Mr\n\nAng also admitted his guilt on innumerable occasions during the inquiry. He also said that although\n\nhe knew that the substance was prohibited, he administered it to the four horses as he had been told\n\nthat it could not be detected in the pre-race blood test and post-race urine test conducted by the\n\nMRA laboratory.76.    Mr Arul submitted that Mr Angs plea of guilt in relation\n\nto his administering of Telzenac to the four horses is invalid because he was under the mistaken\n\nimpression that he was only going to be charged under MRA Rule 203(d), which concerns the absolute\n\nliability of a trainer for prohibited substances found in his horse and not under MRA Rule 200(5),\n\nwhich is applicable where a trainer has personally administered a prohibited substance to his horse.\n\nMr Arul explained that as Mr Ang was under the mistaken impression that the effect of MRA Rule\n\n203(b) is that he is guilty of an offence regardless of whether or not he has personally\n\nadministered a prohibited substance to any of the horses under his training and care, he pleaded\n\nguilty to the charges under MRA Rule 200(5).77.    This submission is untenable as Mr Ang repeatedly\n\nacknowledged at the inquiry that he personally administered Telzenac to the horses. At p 42 of the\n\nnotes of the inquiry, the relevant extract is as follows:Chairman: Youre saying that you administered Eltenac to those horses?Trainer Ang: I am personally responsible for that and theres no denying\n\n  there because I got no defence whatsoever, Ive got no intent to put in any defence.Chairman: So, Mr Ang, to reiterate then, are you saying that STAR DRAGON and\n\n  SKY WARRIOR returned positive to Eltenac because you administered that?Trainer Ang: Thats right, Sir, yes.78.    Mr Fisher then asked Mr Ang about the amount of prohibited\n\nmedication administered to the horses. His question was very specific and referred to Mr Angs own\n\nact. The relevant extract from p 43 of the notes of the inquiry is as follows:Chairman: How much didyouadminister to those horses?Trainer Ang: Also 2 mls, Sir.(emphasis added)79.    Within a short time after the above answer, Mr Fisher\n\nreturned to the subject of Mr Angs personal liability. At p 46 of the notes of the inquiry, the\n\nfollowing extract may be found:Chairman: Mr Ang, can I just ask you  did you personally administer\n\n  medication to these four horses, STAR DRAGON, STAR WARRIOR, CRYSTAL CHILAVERT and PRINZ OSKAR?Trainer Ang: Yes, Sir.Chairman: You administered personally?Trainer Ang: Personally, yes, Sir.80.    It should also be noted that Mr Ang told the inquiry panel\n\nthat when he was questioned by the police, he admitted that he administered the prohibited\n\nmedication to the horses. As is evident from p 64 of the notes of the inquiry, he told the inquiry\n\npanel as follows:Chairman: Did you advise the Police that you administered this medication to\n\n  your horses?Trainer Ang: Yes, yes, I told them I did.81.    Notwithstanding the overwhelming evidence that Mr Ang\n\nadmitted his guilt at the inquiry hearing, he said at the trial that his admission of guilt should\n\nbe ignored because he had told the inquiry panel a pack of lies. As for his admission to the police,\n\nhe also said that he lied to the police and that it must be borne in mind that he was not under oath\n\nwhen he spoke to the police. No one should, without more, expect a re-hearing of his case merely on\n\nthe ground that he had deliberately lied to the inquiry panel and the police. In any case, Mr Ang\n\ndid not establish that what he had told the inquiry panel and the police were lies. As such, much\n\nmore is required to show that his plea of guilt is invalid.Whether Mr Ang was confused at the inquiry82.    Mr Angs final line of attack with respect to the\n\nvalidity of his plea of guilt was that he was so confused and emotional during the inquiry that he\n\nwas in no position to understand the ramifications of his plea of guilt.83.    Throughout the trial, Mr Ang claimed that he was too\n\nconfused at the inquiry on 23 August 2000 to be able to think clearly. However, a perusal of the\n\nnotes of the inquiry will show that Mr Ang did not appear to have been a confused man at the\n\ninquiry. It must be noted that what Mr Ang told the inquiry panel was consistent with what he told\n\nthe police when they interviewed him before the inquiry. He had intended that at the inquiry, he\n\nwould stick to what he told the police. During cross-examination, he said as follows:Since I said those things at the police station, I might as well say the same\n\n  things at the inquiry so that I dont have to implicate anybody.84.    It was not alleged that Mr Ang was confused when he gave\n\nhis statement to the police. As such, if he merely repeated at the inquiry what he told the police\n\nearlier on, namely that he had in his possession prohibited items and that he had administered a\n\nprohibited substance to his horses, his contention that he was so confused at the inquiry that he\n\nwould have pleaded guilty to any charge framed against him at the inquiry cannot be countenanced.85.    When cross-examined, Mr Peter Chadwick, a member of the\n\ninquiry panel, confirmed that he did not think that Mr Ang was in a confused state during the\n\ninquiry. He said as follows:Q. Do you agree that Mr Ang was confused and emotional?A. He was not confused during the inquiry.Q. Did you not think it prudent although Mr Ang did not request it, to adjourn\n\n  the inquiry.A. Mr Ang did not break down. He did not act in a manner which would cause me\n\n  any concern.Q. After five charges were preferred, was it not prudent to adjourn the\n\n  hearing?A. The impression Mr Ang gave me was that he wanted the matter finalised. He\n\n  had pleaded guilty and was willing to throw himself at the mercy of the inquiry panel.86.    Mr Rajendran, another member of the inquiry panel, also did\n\nnot think that Mr Ang was confused at the inquiry. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. What was Mr Angs emotional state at the inquiry?A. He threw in the towel when he came in and said that he was sorry. He was\n\n  calm and cool.Q. Maybe, he was evasive or confused?A. Evasive, not confused.87.    Mr Arul referred to p 62 of the notes of the inquiry, where\n\nMr Ang said in reply to a question by Mr Rajendran that he was so confused that he did not know what\n\nwas happening. This remark must be read in its proper context. When he was cornered by STCs\n\nsecurity officers on 19 August 2000, Mr Ang had asked them not to open a brown bag because he said\n\nthat it contained money. When the bag was searched, it contained no money. Instead, it contained\n\nprohibited items such as Telzenac, Rakelin, needles and syringes. The notes of the inquiry revealed\n\nthat Mr Ang had been confused by his own evidence with respect to the brown bag, which was supposed\n\nto have contained money instead of prohibited items. At first, he said that the brown bag containing\n\nthe prohibited items was the bag that was supposed to have contained his money. Subsequently, he\n\nchanged his position and claimed that there were two brown bags instead. The relevant extract from p\n\n62 of the notes of the inquiry is as follows:Mr Rajendran: On the 16th, you came back from Perth?Trainer Ang: Yes, I came back from Perth with that bag of money.Mr Rajendran: Ok. Is that the same bag as?Trainer Ang: The same bag, yes. I think I got same bag,it was the same bag.Mr Rajendran: You sure it was the same bag?Trainer Ang:Im so confused, I dont know what is happening.Mr Rajendran: Take your time, take your time.Trainer Ang:Hang on, I had two bags in the bag.Mr Rajendran: So two bags?Trainer Ang: Ive two bags, both are brown.(emphasis added)88.    Mr Rajendran took the view that Mr Angs confusion was\n\nlimited to the issue of the brown bags. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. He said at p 62 of the Notes of Evidence that he was confused. Was he crying\n\n  at this point?A. He was not crying. He was confused because he was trying to establish which\n\n  bag it was.Q. If he is confused, is it possible that he did not understand what was going\n\n  on?A. No. We were trying to establish which bag it was. I dont think he was\n\n  confused. He perfectly understood what was going on.89.    Mr Chadwick also had no doubt that Mr Angs confusion was\n\nonly in relation to his own explanation on the brown bags. When cross-examined, he said that when Mr\n\nAng said that he was confused, he was asking Mr Rajendran for a clarification of his question with\n\nrespect to the brown bag.90.    After listening to the witnesses and evaluating the\n\nevidence, I have no doubt that Mr Angs confusion was limited to the question of the brown bag and\n\nthat although he may have been stressed and anxious during the inquiry, he was not so confused as to\n\nbe unable to understand the proceedings or the ramifications of his plea of guilt.Lack of legal advice91.    Mr Arul also submitted that Mr Angs plea of guilt was\n\naffected by a lack of legal advice. Mr Ang claimed that he tried but failed to contact Mr Arul on\n\nthe day before the inquiry. It must be noted that Mr Ang knew that he was in serious trouble and he\n\nknew from experience that an inquiry would be called at any moment. He also knew that the MRA Rules\n\ndid not permit him to be represented by a lawyer at the inquiry. He would not have waited until the\n\nlast minute to try and contact Mr Arul or any other lawyer if he needed legal advice. As has already\n\nbeen mentioned earlier on in the judgment, Mr Ang had planned all along to admit his guilt in the\n\nhope of getting a lighter sentence. In these circumstances, he is in no position to complain that he\n\ndid not have time to consult a lawyer or that he was not allowed any legal representation at the\n\ninquiry. I thus find that Mr Angs decision to plead guilty has got nothing to do with the lack of\n\nlegal advice.Whether Mr Ang pleaded guilty to void charges92.    Mr Arul also submitted that the charges against Mr Ang were\n\ninvalid for a number of reasons.93.    To begin with, the first charge will be considered. It\n\nconcerns a breach of Rule 203(d) of the MRA Rules of Racing, which provides as follows:No person other than an Official Veterinary Surgeon or a person authorised by\n\n  the Club shall have in his possessionin any stable or grounds of a race track:(i) any means of parenteral or nasogastric administration of any prohibited\n\n    substance;(ii) any prohibited substance.(emphasis added)94.    As has been mentioned, Mr Ang was found with needles,\n\nsyringes and medication such as Rakelin and Telzenac. Needles and syringes are regarded as means of\n\nparenteral administration of prohibited substances and Rakelin and Telzenac are prohibited\n\nsubstances. Notwithstanding this, Mr Arul contended that Mr Ang had not breached Rule 203(d) of the\n\nMRA Rules of Racing because he was not found to have been in possession of the prohibited items\n\nwhile in any stable or grounds of a race track. Instead, he was caught with the prohibited items\n\nwhile in the car park. Whether or not a purposive construction of the term \"stable\" should\n\nbe employed so as to include within its ambit the stable complex, an enclosed area which includes\n\nthe car park, need not be considered because Mr Ang admitted at the inquiry that the bag containing\n\nthe prohibited items was in his stable. At p 5 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:To be honest with you, Sir, I carried this bag around without realising it my\n\n  stuff was in there. I had it in my bag when I, when I, when I wasin the stable in the\n\n  morning of Thursday and actually I forgot it was in there. And all the time I was carrying\n\n  it around.(emphasis added)95.    When he was questioned by Mr Rajendran, Mr Ang again\n\nadmitted that the prohibited items were brought to his stable. The following extract from p 59 of\n\nthe notes of the inquiry makes this clear:Mr Rajendran: When did you bring to your stable?Trainer Ang: On the Thursday.Mr Rajendran: That was on the 17thyou are trying to tell?Trainer Ang: Yes.96.    As for the contention that the search conducted by STCs\n\nsecurity officers in the car park was illegal, this is not tenable because Rule 203(e) of the MRA\n\nRules of Racing specifically provides that STCs security officers are entitled to \"enter and\n\nsearch any stable and anystable complex\".Surely, the car park within the\n\nfenced-up enclosure in which the respective stables of the trainers are located is part of the\n\nstable complex. In these circumstances, the argument that the first charge against Mr Ang is invalid\n\nhas no merit.97.    In regard to the second, third, fourth and fifth charges\n\nagainst Mr Ang concerning the administering of Telzenac to the four horses, Mr Arul pointed out that\n\nall that Mr Ang had admitted to at the inquiry was that he had administered Telzenac to the four\n\nhorses on the Thursday before the relevant Saturday race day. He pointed out that Dr Kimberley John\n\nRose, an Australian veterinary surgeon, gave evidence to the effect that if a horse had been given\n\nTelzenac on a Thursday, there would be no trace of the medication by Saturday. In view of this, he\n\nsaid that Mr Angs plea of guilt was ineffective as it was impossible to relate his admission that\n\nhe administered Telzenac to the horses on Thursday to the failure of the horses to pass the tests on\n\nSaturday.98.    The above argument fails to take into account the effect of\n\nRule 200(5) of the MRA Rules of Racing, which provides that any person who administers any\n\nprohibited substance to a horse\"which has been entered for a race\"may be\n\ndisqualified. Mr Ang knew that the horses had already been entered for a race when he administered\n\nTelzenac to them on Thursday. At p 39 of the notes of the inquiry, he said as follows:Chairman: So when you administered this medication to CRYSTAL CHILAVERT and\n\n  PRINZ OSKAR on or about the 17thof August, were you aware that you were administering\n\n  a prohibited substance?Trainer Ang: Yes, Sir.Chairman: And were you aware that that would be contrary to the Rules as those\n\n  horses were entered to race?Trainer Ang: I was aware of that, Sir, but I was thinking of the welfare of the\n\n  horse, Sir.99.    In view of the aforesaid, the contention that Mr Ang did\n\nnot admit that he had breached Rule 200(5) of the MRA Rules of Racing is rejected.Mr Angs plea of guilt is valid100.    I hold that Mr Angs plea of guilt was unequivocal and\n\nthat he understood the nature and consequences of his plea.",
        "D. WHETHER MR FISHER WAS BIASED?": "101.    Finally, I turn to the allegation that Mr Fisher should\n\nnot have chaired the inquiry proceedings because he was biased against Mr Ang. It is trite law that\n\na person may be disqualified from hearing or determining a case or matter because of actual or\n\napparent bias. (See, for instance, the decision of the Court of Appeal inTang Liang Hong v Lee\n\nKuan Yew & Anor[1998] 1 SLR 97.)102.    Mr Ang said that he had a bad relationship with Mr Fisher.\n\nFor a start, he contended that sometime around July 2000, Mr Fisher had accused him of spreading\n\nrumours about his impending resignation from STC. Secondly, it was alleged that Mr Fisher had on\n\noccasion voiced his unhappiness over the fact that Mr Angs daughter, Ms Crystal Ang, rode to the\n\nstarting gate without using stirrups. Thirdly, Mr Ang pointed out that Ms Ang had on several\n\noccasions received unnecessarily harsh sentences from the panel of stipendiary stewards when Mr\n\nFisher was presiding. Finally, Mr Ang submitted that the harsh sentence received by him on 23 August\n\n2000 showed that STC and its officials were biased against him.103.    Mr Ang failed to prove his assertion that Mr Fisher was\n\nbiased against him for a number of reasons. To begin with, in his letter of 22 August 2000 to Mr\n\nFisher, he stated as follows:I am ashamed of myself for letting you down despiteyour leniency towards me in the\n\n  past.(emphasis added)104.    When cross-examined, Mr Ang confirmed that he thought that\n\nMr Fisher had been lenient in the past. He said as follows:Q. Did you not state in your letter of 22 August 2000 that Mr Fisher had been\n\n  lenient to you in the past?A. It appears that he was lenient in the past. To me, he was lenient.105.    It is also worth noting that Mr Fisher did not submit Mr\n\nAngs letter of 22 August 2000 to him as evidence before the inquiry panel. As has already been\n\nmentioned, Mr Ang said in this letter that he was totally wrong and that he was guilty in every\n\nsense of the word. If Mr Fisher was indeed biased, he would have placed the said letter before the\n\ninquiry panel as that would have seriously prejudiced Mr Angs case.106.    As for Mr Angs allegation that Mr Fisher had accused\n\nhim of spreading rumours, Mr Fisher said as follows in para 86 of his affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief:The plaintiff has chosen to exaggerate an issue which I mentioned in passing to\n\n  him during one of our conversations. I had been informed by a member of the defendants staff\n\n  that the plaintiff had mentioned that I might be resigning. When I next spoke to the plaintiff, I\n\n  asked him in passing whether he had said such a thing. The plaintiff expressed his surprise and\n\n  said that he had not made such a statement. I left it at that. I was neither confrontational [nor]\n\n  accusatory.107.    When cross-examined and when questioned by me, Mr Angs\n\nanswers confirmed Mr Fishers position. His answers were as follows:Q. You said that Mr Fisher accused you of spreading rumours?A. Yes.Q. All that Mr Fisher asked you was whether you told other people that he was\n\n  resigning?A. He asked me if I told people and I said I did not and that was all.Ct. That ended the matter?A. Yes. He added that he was not resigning. He then walked away.108.    As for the allegation that Mr Fisher was displeased with\n\nMr Angs daughter for riding to the starting gate without the use of stirrups, Mr Fisher admitted\n\nthat he told Ms Ang that riding without the use of stirrups at the starting gate is bad form.\n\nHowever, he stressed that he was only trying to educate Ms Ang as she was an apprentice jockey and\n\nit was STCs policy to improve the image of horse racing. When cross-examined, Mr Ang conceded\n\nthat Mr Fisher was performing his duties as an official of STC whenever he mentioned that Ms Ang\n\nshould not ride to the starting gate without stirrups.109.    As for Ms Angs allegation that she had received\n\nmanifestly unfair or unnecessary sentences from the panel of Stipendiary Stewards whenever Mr Fisher\n\nwas the chairman of the panel, Mr Fisher pointed out that Ms Angs disciplinary record is\n\n\"fairly average\". He produced the disciplinary records of Ms Ang and two other apprentice\n\njockeys to prove his point. He also noted that Ms Angs sentences had been upheld on appeal by the\n\nRacing Stewards.110.    Ms Crystal Ang did not substantiate her allegation that Mr\n\nFisher was biased against her and her father. Although she tried to correct her position during\n\nre-examination, her answers during cross-examination clearly showed that she had no basis for\n\nalleging that Mr Fisher was biased. She said as follows:Q. Did you think Mr Fisher was biased because you were suspended?A. Yes.Q. Is that the only reason why you think he was biased?A. Yes.Q. Did you think that the racing stewards who heard your appeals and affirmed\n\n  the decisions were biased?A. No.111.    Finally, Mr Angs complaint that the sentence imposed on\n\nhim was unduly harsh and manifestly excessive will be considered. In his statement of claim, he\n\nasserted that the sentence which he received was clearly disproportionate to the offences which he\n\ncommitted and this can only be explained on the basis that there is evidence of bias on the part of\n\nSTC or its representatives. Although he further asserted in his statement of claim that there were\n\nprevious cases involving other race horse trainers who were merely fined for offences with\n\n\"similar facts\", no credible evidence of such cases was produced at the trial. In\n\ncontrast, Mr Fisher pointed out that this was the first case in which a trainer has been found\n\nguilty of personally administering a prohibited substance to his horse. As for the possession of\n\nprohibited items, Mr Fisher referred to another case where a trainer was also disqualified for two\n\nyears for having in his possession equipment for the nasogastric administration of prohibited\n\nsubstances. In view of this, Mr Angs claim that the sentence which he received showed that STC\n\nbreached its duty to act in a fair and reasonable manner in sentencing him cannot be countenanced.112.    When cross-examined, Mr Ang acknowledged that he thought\n\nthat Mr Fisher was biased only because he was unhappy with the penalty meted out to him at the\n\ninquiry of 23 August 2000. He said:Q. You say that he is biased?A. I know he is biased according to the penalty meted out to me.Q. Are you saying that he was biased just because of the penalty?A. Yes.113.    I thus hold that Mr Ang failed to establish that Mr Fisher\n\nshould not have sat on the inquiry panel which heard his case on 23 August 2000.E. CONCLUSION114.    Although Mr Ang claimed that he was confused and that he\n\ndid not know what was happening at the inquiry hearing on 23 August 2000, he had no basis for saying\n\nthat he had told the inquiry panel and the police a pack of lies. The evidence is that he had\n\nplanned from the very start to admit his guilt and had hoped that his sincerity in co-operating with\n\nthe panel of Stipendiary Stewards will result in the imposition of a fine and not a\n\ndisqualification. He was clearly startled when the Stipendiary Stewards decided to disqualify him\n\nfor a total of ten years. In the final analysis, after having pleaded guilty to the charges faced by\n\nhim, Mr Ang tried to obtain a re-hearing of his case because the punishment imposed on him was more\n\nsevere than what he had expected.115.    Mr Angs claim is dismissed with costs.",
