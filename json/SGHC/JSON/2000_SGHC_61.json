        "Statements": "15 Besides the cautioned statement made by the accused on 6 August 1999\n\n(exh P-81 at page 278 of the PI notes), the prosecution sought to admit three other\n\nstatements recorded from the accused on 11 August, 14 August and 24 August 1999. The\n\ndefence did not raise any objection to the admission of the cautioned statement. In the\n\nsaid cautioned statement the accused said:I do not know anything about the stuff. That’s all.16 However with regard to the other three statements, there were\n\nobjections as to their admission. Consequently, a trial within a trial ensued. At thevoir\n\ndire, the evidence of the prosecution witnesses, namely, Insp Soh, interpreter Sofia\n\nbte Sufri, S/Sgt Ronnie See, S/Sgt Patrick Phoa and S/Sgt Xavier was that they never\n\ncoerced, threatened, induced or made any promises to the accused with a view to proffering\n\nany statements from him. The only nick in the prosecution’s case was an admission by\n\nthe interpreter Sofia that during one of the recording sessions, whilst Insp Soh was in\n\nthe process of obtaining the personal particulars of the accused, she enquired from the\n\naccused whether he was the brother of one Sharifah Imah, a woman who had been involved in\n\nan unrelated previous drug offence. She asked him what had happened to her. The accused\n\nreplied that his sister had been discharged from the capital case. The interpreter also\n\nsaid when she asked him about his sister, the accused appeared surprised. The interpreter\n\nagreed with defence counsel that questions were posed to the accused about the background\n\nof the accused as well as his family members and when asked whether any incriminating\n\nquestions were put to the accused during the recording, she responded in the affirmative.17 In his evidence during the trial within a trial, the accused alleged\n\nthat the statements sought to be admitted were not made by him voluntarily and that they\n\nwere given under duress, threat, inducement and promises emanating from various CNB\n\nofficers. His allegations could be summarised as follows:(a) On the day of arrest(i) Inside the taxi-cab shortly after his arrest:Allegation: He was questioned by S/Sgt Ronnie See in a stern\n\n    manner.(ii) In the Yishun flat:Allegation: He was questioned by Insp Soh. Besides Insp Soh he\n\n    was once pulled aside by a tall Malay officer (Adam Fashe Huddin) and was told he had\n\n    better admit and co-operate since he was caught with evidence. The same officer also\n\n    questioned him in a firm tone about the drugs seized. He maintained however that he did\n\n    not know anything about the drugs.(b)6 August 1999Allegation:After his cautioned statement had been completed,\n\n    Insp Soh showed the accused the photograph of the son as well as the girlfriend of the\n\n    accused and told him to think about their future, especially his son. Insp Soh told him to\n\n    co-operate otherwise he would recommend to the authorities the confiscation of his flat\n\n    where he was residing with his parents and son. His mind was not at ease since he had only\n\n    one son and both his parents were old. If the house were to be confiscated they would have\n\n    no roof over their heads. He felt pressurised and confused.(c)11 August 1999Allegation:On this occasion interpreter Sofia asked him about\n\n    his sister. She told him that she had acted as the interpreter when his sister was facing\n\n    a capital charge. This fact was interpreted to Insp Soh. Whatever statement he made on 11\n\n    August 1999 was not made of his free will and not voluntarily given. By giving the\n\n    statement he was trying to save the best for his son, his parents and the flat where he\n\n    was residing.(d)14 August 1999:Allegation: His mind was not at ease. He believed whatever Insp\n\n    Soh told him about his son and house on 6 August 1999. He therefore gave a statement which\n\n    was by way of questions and answers. Insp Soh questioned him about his past. After the\n\n    statement had been completed, Insp Soh told him to think about the charge he was facing.\n\n    Insp Soh told him this time too that he was going to recommend the confiscation of his\n\n    house because most of his siblings were all involved in drug offences. The interpreter was\n\n    not present at the time when Insp Soh told him this. The accused was afraid. He believed\n\n    Insp Soh was serious because this was the second occasion he had told him so. The\n\n    statement he made on 14 August 1999 was involuntary.(e)24 August 1999Allegation:Again this was a question and answer session.\n\n    Whenever he went out of line or forgot events, he was corrected by Insp Soh and the\n\n    interpreter. The questions and answers were also in reference to his brothers’ and\n\n    sisters’ drug history as well. The statement given by him on 24 August 1999 was\n\n    involuntary.18 It is a settled principle that the prosecution would have to prove\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that the statements which it sought to admit were made\n\nvoluntarily without any of the vitiating elements of threat, inducement, promise or\n\noppression. The law as regards statements made to CNB officers is governed by s 24 of the\n\nEvidence Act (Cap 97). In this regard, it is instructive to recite the principles pithily\n\nset out by Yong Pung How CJ inGulam bin Notar Shariff Jamalddin v Public Prosecutor[1999] 2 SLR 181at 203 (CA) where he said:The admissibility of the … statements is governed by s 24 of the\n\n  Evidence Act which reads:A confession made by an accused person is irrelevant if the making of\n\n    the confession appears to the court to have been caused by any inducement, threat or\n\n    promise having reference to the charge against the accused person, proceeding from a\n\n    person in authority and sufficient in the opinion of the court to give the accused person\n\n    grounds which would appear to him reasonable for supposing that by making it he would gain\n\n    any advantage or avoid any evil of a temporal nature in reference to the proceeding\n\n    against him.Whether a statement is voluntary is a question of fact:Tan Boon Tat\n\n  v PP[1992] 2 SLR 1, followingDPP v Ping Lin[1975] 3 All ER 175. It is also\n\n  well established that the common law concept of involuntariness by oppression inR v\n\n  Prager(1972) 56 Cr App R 51 has been subsumed under s 24 of the Evidence Act. The\n\n  test for determining admissibility under s 24 is first, whether the confession was made as\n\n  a consequence of any inducement, threat or promise, and second, whether in making that\n\n  confession, the accused did so in circumstances which, in the opinion of the court, would\n\n  have led him reasonably to suppose that he would gain some advantage for himself or would\n\n  avoid some evil of a temporal nature to himself. Both are questions of fact and are\n\n  matters of judicial evaluation: seeSeow Choon Meng v PP[1994] 2 SLR 853andTan\n\n  Boon Tat v PP[1992] 2 SLR 1, followingDPP v Ping Lin[1975] 3 All ER 175. The\n\n  test of voluntariness is applied in a manner which is partly objective and partly\n\n  subjective. The objective limb is satisfied if there is a threat, inducement or promise,\n\n  and the subjective limb when the threat, inducement or promise operates on the mind of the\n\n  particular accused through hope of escape or fear of punishment connected with the charge:Dato Mokhtar bin Hashim v PP[1983] 2 MLJ 232andMohd Desa bin Hashim v PP[1995] 3 MLJ 350. Where voluntariness is challenged, the burden is on the prosecution to\n\n  prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the confession was made voluntarily and not on the\n\n  defence to prove on a balance of probabilities that the confession was not made\n\n  voluntarily:Koh Aik Siew v PP[1993] 2 SLR 599. However, the accused need only\n\n  raise a reasonable doubt or, in other words, it is only necessary for the prosecution to\n\n  remove a reasonable doubt of the existence of the threat, inducement or promise, and not\n\n  every lurking shadow of influence or remnants of fear:Panya Martmontree v PP[1995] 3 SLR 341.19 Also inPoh Kay Keong v Public Prosecutor[1996] 1 SLR 209, the Singapore Court of Appeal in allowing the appeal of the accused and in the\n\nprocess reversing the trial court’s finding that the statements given by the accused\n\nwere voluntary, held at page 210:(1) The purpose or object of s 24 of the Evidence Act was to ensure the\n\n  reliability of a confession. This was founded on the premise that a confession brought\n\n  about as a result of an inducement, threat or promise was not reliable and should be\n\n  excluded. Giving s 24 a purposive construction, an inducement, threat or promise ‘had\n\n  reference to the charge against the accused person’ if it was made to obtain a\n\n  confession relevant or relating to the charge in question. Similarly, the\n\n  ‘advantage’ or ‘evil’ had ‘reference to the proceedings against\n\n  an accused person’, if it was gained or avoided (as the case may be) by the making of\n\n  a statement relevant or relating to the charge brought against the appellant (see pp\n\n  220B-D, 221D-G);Ibrahim v R[1914] AC 599 andCustoms and Excise Commissioners\n\n  v Harz & Anor[1967] AC 760 followed.20 Bearing the foregoing principles in mind, I proceeded to evaluate\n\nthe evidence adduced at the trial within a trial. In the main, the question before me was\n\nwhether Insp Soh did utter the words ascribed to him by the accused and if he did, whether\n\nthose words had the effect of negativing the voluntariness of the statements referred to.21 Insofar as the prosecution witnesses were concerned – save for\n\nan intrusive and unwarranted enquiry by the interpreter which I had earlier adverted to -\n\nno vitiating comments, threats, inducements or promises were ever made to the accused\n\neither during or before the commencement of the recording of the statements. Their\n\nevidence was by and large consistent and free from any significant inconsistency. However,\n\nthe claim of the accused, I must say, was replete with contradictions and inconsistencies,\n\nsome of which were major and they could be summarised as follows:(i) It was put to Insp Soh by the defence that after the interpreter\n\n  had left the interview room on 6 August 1999, Insp Soh told the accused that he knew the\n\n  background of his family members. But when the accused was asked during his\n\n  cross-examination whether Insp Soh told him that he knew of his family background, the\n\n  accused answered in the negative.(ii) It was further put to Insp Soh by the defence that after 6 August\n\n  1999 and before 11 August 1999, Insp Soh had an opportunity to meet the accused and he\n\n  reminded him again to ‘better co-operate’. In this connection, Insp Soh was\n\n  specifically asked whether he had met the accused on 7 August 1999 when the accused and\n\n  Daud were taken out of lock-up. Insp Soh denied the allegation. But when the accused was\n\n  asked by the prosecution during his cross-examination whether he had met Insp Soh after 6\n\n  August 1999 and before the recording of the statement on 11 August 1999, his answer was in\n\n  the negative.(iii) It was further put to Insp Soh that on 11 August 1999 he once\n\n  again reminded the accused: ‘Think about your child. Give me a good statement and I\n\n  will know what to do for you.’ Insp Soh denied this allegation. It was further put to\n\n  Insp Soh that he told the accused: ‘the drugs belong (sic) to Hamal. I know about\n\n  this. Better co-operate.’ However when the accused was asked during his\n\n  cross-examination whether Insp Soh uttered the words ‘Think about your child, give me\n\n  a good statement and I will know what to do for you’, his reply was: ‘He never\n\n  mentioned about this.’ When he was asked whether on 11 August 1999 Insp Soh mentioned\n\n  anything about the ownership of the drugs, his reply was in the negative.(iv) It was further put to Insp Soh by the defence that he threatened\n\n  the accused on 14 August 1999 before the interpreter came in. But the evidence of the\n\n  accused in his examination-in-chief contradicted what was put to Insp Soh. The accused\n\n  maintained all along that when he went into the room of Insp Soh on 14 August 1999,\n\n  interpreter Sofia was already there. It was also put to Insp Soh by defence counsel that\n\n  on 14 August 1999, he told the accused that the six keys seized from him belonged to the\n\n  flat at Yishun Ring Road and he had better co-operate. Insp Soh however disagreed. Here\n\n  again when the accused was asked in cross-examination whether Insp Soh said anything to\n\n  him about the keys on 14 August 1999, he answered that he could not recall.(v) Above all, when asked by the court whether on the 14 or on 24\n\n  August 1999 Insp Soh put pressure on him by mentioning the possibility of the confiscation\n\n  of his flat or the matter concerning his family members, the accused simply answered that\n\n  he could not recall.22 Having reviewed all the evidence and having observed the witnesses,\n\nI was of the view that the prosecution had indeed proven that the statements recorded on\n\n11, 14 and 24 August 1999 were voluntarily made by the accused. The intrusion of the\n\ninterpreter, although improper and merited a stricture, did not in my view bring about any\n\npressure on the accused. In the end, I was satisfied that the three statements sought to\n\nbe admitted were voluntarily made without being tainted by threat, inducement or any\n\nelement of oppresion. Consequently, I admitted those statements after being assured by the\n\nlearned DPP and defence counsel that irrelevant and possibly prejudicial matters appearing\n\nin the statements had been excised.23 Relevant segments of the statements admitted read as follows:(1)Paragraphs 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the statement recorded on\n\n  11 August 1999 (exh P-84A):3. The next day, on 5 Aug 1999, we checked out at about 12\n\n  something p.m. I went alone back home to the above address at Jurong. I stayed at home\n\n  until about 3 or 4 p.m. Then I went out. Before I went out, I called Daud and asked him to\n\n  wait for me at the void deck of Blk 65 Kallang Bahru. I called him from my handphone\n\n  97472443. I asked him if he could follow me to Blk 65 Kallang Bahru. Daud asked for the\n\n  reason. I told him nothing, just follow me. He said he would meet me there by 3-plus p.m.\n\n  When he received my call, it was on his handphone. His tel no is 96437137. I went to\n\n  Kallang Bahru Blk 65 5thfloor to the compartment covering the pipes just\n\n  beside the staircase to pick up my thing which was the stuff that I was caught with. The\n\n  stuff is heroin. I am now shown a bag by the recording officer and I confirm it to be the\n\n  one that contained the 5 packets of heroin and which I picked up from the compartment of 5thfloor of Blk 65 Kallang Bahru. (Recorder’s note: the accused is shown a bag seized\n\n  during his arrest on 5 Aug). My dealer put the stuff there. I called him Ah Poh (a Chinese\n\n  male).… For this transaction at Kallang Bahru, Ah Poh called me on 3\n\n  August 1999 at about 2 p.m. on my handphone. He asked me if I needed any stuff. I told him\n\n  I needed 5 packets of heroin in about 2-day’s time. He told me to put S$22,000 at the\n\n  compartment of 5thfloor next to the staircase at Blk 65 Kallang Bahru on 4 Aug\n\n  by afternoon. He said he would put the heroin on 5 August. He also said he would call me\n\n  in the afternoon on 5 August 1999. On 4 Aug at about 2-plus p.m., I went to put the\n\n  S$22,000 at the said location after which I left. At about 2-plus p.m. on 5 Aug 1999, Ah\n\n  Poh called me thro’ my handphone and told me the heroin would be there by 3-plus p.m.4. When I arrived at Kallang Bahru, Daud was already waiting at the\n\n  void deck of Blk 65. (The accused was shown a photo and he affirm (sic) it to be Mohamed\n\n  Daud Bin Salih NRIC: S7011052J) I asked him to call a taxi and I also told him that we\n\n  were going to Yishun Ring road Blk 243. Daud never asked me the purpose of going there. I\n\n  went up to the 5thfloor to collect the heroin. Before coming down, I called\n\n  Daud to ask where was he and whether the taxi had arrived. He said the taxi was here, at\n\n  the entrance of the carpark. When I came down, I was carrying a bag with the five packets\n\n  of heroin inside. Daud was already in the taxi sitting in the front seat. I sat behind.\n\n  The taxi moved off for Yishun. We were going to Blk 243 4thfloor; I don’t\n\n  remember the unit numbers. The unit was the same unit that CNB officers later brought me\n\n  and Daud there. I intended to put the heroin in the said unit after which we would leave\n\n  to walk around Orchard Rd.5. While we were in the taxi, I received a phone call from Yah\n\n  thro’ my handphone. It was a casual talk. I was not sure whether Daud received or\n\n  made any phone call. At the red light junction at Yishun (I don’t know what road),\n\n  CNB officers just came from nowhere and arrested us. Two officers came and handcuffed me,\n\n  one from the left rear door and one from the right rear door. They asked several questions\n\n  to which I just answered I don’t know. The taxi was then asked to move up along the\n\n  roadside next to the Sports Stadium. Just when the two officers who were on my right and\n\n  left moved to leave the taxi, I threw my handphone which I was holding all the while\n\n  despite being handcuffed from the back out of the rear right door. I don’t know if\n\n  the handphone was in the taxi or on the road. But most probably the handphone was on the\n\n  road. I threw away my handphone because a lot of people called me. I was afraid and\n\n  confused. I threw the handphone away on impulse. The model of my handphone was a Samsung,\n\n  black in color.6. The unit at Blk 243 Yishun Ring Rd is not my house. I wanted to stay\n\n  alone. The house at Jurong belonged to my family. About one month-plus ago, I met a friend\n\n  (I called him Aziz). I am now shown a photo of a male whom I confirm to be Aziz.\n\n  (Recorder’s note: the accused is shown a photo of Mohamad Hamal Bin Abd Karim NRIC S\n\n  7348683A) I told him I was looking for a house. Aziz said he had a house which he\n\n  didn’t stay and would let me stay for free but I must take care of the house. I\n\n  shifted there in about mid-July and stayed there most of the time instead of the Jurong\n\n  house. When I shifted in, all the two rooms were not locked and remained so since then.\n\n  All the items seized from the storeroom belonged to me.(2)Paragraphs 15, 21 and 22 of the statement recorded on 14\n\n  August 1999:15. I am now shown a black and white Bodypac bag by the recording\n\n  officer and I confirm it to be the same bag that I picked up from the compartment on 5\n\n  Aug, the same bag that contained the 5 packets of heroin, the same bag that I carried\n\n  downstairs to the taxi, and the same bag I was caught with when I was arrested.\n\n  (Recorder’s note: The accused is shown a black and white Bodypac bag marked\n\n  \"D\"). I am also shown a photo of a male Malay and I affirm him to be Daud.\n\n  (Recorder’s note: the accused is shown a photo of Mohamed Daud Bin Salih, NRIC S\n\n  7011052J).21. At the house of Blk 243 at Yishun Ring road, all the seized items\n\n  belonged to me. When Aziz handed over the keys of the house to me, these items were not\n\n  there. The one straw found in the right bottom drawer of the wardrobe, I must have left it\n\n  there. It is heroin and is for my consumption. The digital weighing machine is for\n\n  weighing the heroin in order to re-pack from the 5 packets of heroin. The empty sachets\n\n  are also for re-packing purpose and the two pincers for sealing the sachets. The knife was\n\n  for cutting the packets of heroin. The two metal spoons are for scooping the heroin from\n\n  the packet into the sachet. The three boxes of candles are for sealing purpose. The bowl\n\n  is for containing the heroin after I have cut open the packets. The plastic container is\n\n  for arranging the sachets that have been filled up. I intend to sell a sachet for S$200.22. I may come back the next day to do the re-packing alone.24 At the close of the prosecution’s case, the learned DPP offered\n\naltogether 19 witnesses and also made available to the defence Hamal, who was initially a\n\nco-accused in this trial but had been dealt with separately upon his pleading guilty to a\n\nreduced charge before another court. He was the tenant and the other occupant of the\n\nYishun Ring Road flat where, amongst other things, drug trafficking paraphernalia had been\n\nrecovered.25 Defence counsel did not make any submission at the close of the\n\nprosecution’s case The learned DPP, relying on (a) the seizure of the five packets of\n\ndrugs inside the black haversack found next to the accused, which on analysis were found\n\nto contain 32.27g of diamorphine; (b) the evidence of Daud and the taxi driver that the\n\naccused was in possession of the said haversack when he boarded the taxi; and (c) the\n\nadmissions of the accused as contained in the statements that he was in possession of the\n\ndrugs found in the haversack and that he intended to deal with them, submitted that aprima\n\nfaciecase had been made out against the accused which if unrebutted would warrant his\n\nconviction.26 Having considered all the evidence, even if the statements admitted\n\nas being voluntarily made were to be disregarded, I was satisfied that the prosecution had\n\nmade out a case against the accused on the charge, which if unrebutted would warrant his\n\nconviction. Consequently I called upon the accused to enter his defence; the standard\n\nallocution was administered and he was explained the courses open to him. The accused\n\nhowever elected to remain silent. Notwithstanding an adjournment granted to reconsider his\n\ndecision, he still elected to remain silent and did not wish to call any witnesses on his\n\nbehalf. His counsel also did not make any submission, admittedly upon his instructions.",
        "Final speech": "27 The learned DPP’s final speech was by and large similar in\n\nsubstance to his address at the close of the prosecution’s case. Despite the silence\n\nof the accused, I reviewed all the evidence presented and considered the submissions by\n\nthe DPP.",
        "Findings and conclusion": "28 The standard allocution administered to the accused contained a\n\nmandatory warning that his refusal to give evidence might lead to adverse inferences as\n\nappear proper as provided under s 196(2) of the CPC. Section 196(2) of the CPC provides as\n\nfollows:196.-(1) …(2) If the accused –(a) after being called upon by the court to give evidence or after he\n\n      or the advocate representing him has informed the court that he will give evidence,\n\n      refuses to be sworn or affirmed; or(b) having been sworn or affirmed, without good cause refuses to answer\n\n      any question,the court, in determining whether the accused is guilty of the offence\n\n  charged, may draw such inferences from the refusal as appear proper.29 Section 196(2) of the CPC was introduced in Singapore in 1976 by\n\namendments to the CPC following recommendations by the UK Criminal Law Revision Committee\n\nin its 11thReport. The Committee’s recommendation is contained in para\n\n111 of the Report and it is reproduced hereunder:… At present the failure of the accused to give evidence is not\n\n  allowed to be treated as corroboration. We disagree with this rule. It seems to us clearly\n\n  right that, when the prosecution have adduced sufficient evidence of a fact to be\n\n  considered by the jury or magistrates’ court, the failure of the accused to give\n\n  evidence denying the fact should be capable of corroborating the evidence of it.\n\n  Admittedly, if the case is one where corroboration is required by law and the prosecution\n\n  have not enough corroborative evidence to adduce, they may be unable to start the\n\n  proceedings, because they will not know whether the accused will or will not give\n\n  evidence; but there may be other corroborative evidence, and failure to give evidence will\n\n  add to this. In any event the question relates also to where corroboration, though\n\n  desirable, is not required as a matter of law.30 In my view, s 196(2) of the CPC had not introduced any new concept\n\nto the way the law was administered in our criminal courts. Prevalent judicial approach\n\nprior to the introduction of that section could be gleaned from a decision by the\n\nFederation of Malaya Court of Appeal inChan Chwen Kong v Public Prosecutor[1962] 28 MLJ 307where Thomson CJ observed at page 308:… In most criminal cases there is at some stage an onus of a sort\n\n  upon the accused person. Once the prosecution produces evidence which if believed would\n\n  support a conviction there is a tactical onus on the accused person either to produce\n\n  evidence of his own or to point to something in the prosecution evidence that at the very\n\n  lowest make the trier of fact less than sure of any conclusions he might otherwise be\n\n  prepared to base upon the prosecution evidence. If he fails to discharge that tactical\n\n  onus he will be convicted. …31 The accused’s considered decision not to give evidence in his\n\ndefence meant that he had failed to discharge the tactical onus placed on him.32 In my finding, the prosecution had indeed proven beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that the accused was in possession of the drugs which contained 32.27g of\n\ndiamorphine. This unchallenged aspect immediately raised the presumptions as contained in\n\nss 17, 18(1)(a) and 18(2) of the MDA. By electing to remain silent and neglecting to\n\nexplain how he came to be in possession of the offending drugs the accused had clearly\n\nfailed to discharge the burden of rebutting the presumptions adverted to on a balance of\n\nprobabilities. After reviewing all the evidence, I was satisfied that even without the\n\nneed to resorting to the statements admitted at the trial within a trial, the prosecution\n\nhad discharged its ultimate burden in proving its case against the accused beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt. In the result, I found the accused guilty of the charge he faced,\n\nconvicted him and sentenced him to the only punishment prescribed under the law.Dated this 19thday of April 2000.MPH RUBINJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
