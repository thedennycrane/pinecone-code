        "The present appeal": "8       The plaintiff filed the present originating\n                    summons on 12 May 2010. On 31 May 2010, the defendant applied to\n                    strike it out on the ground that it was an abuse of process of court, or\n                    alternatively, it was frivolous and vexatious, but the arguments presented were\n                    made on the first ground. 9       The defendant’s argument was that as Suit\n                    764 was struck out and judgment was entered against the plaintiff, it was an\n                    abuse of process of court for the plaintiff to commence the second action on the\n                    same cause of action. When the plaintiff applied to set aside the judgment in\n                    Suit 764, the defendant argued that as the plaintiff did not appeal against the\n                    case of 26 October 2009: [I]t is clear law that if the Plaintiffs took the view that their conduct\n                        in Suit 764 had not been contumelious and that they should be allowed to\n                        pursue their claim for alleged trade mark infringement and passing off\n                        against the Defendant,the onus was on them to file an\n                            appeal against the [dismissal order]. It is completely wrong\n                        for the Plaintiffs not to pursue this avenue of appeal and instead file a\n                        fresh action for the same cause of action against the Defendant. [emphasis in original] 10     That submission has to be examined against the\n                    record of the proceedings. An Assistant Registrar (“AR”) who\n                    dismissed the plaintiff’s application to set aside the judgment,\n                    wrote: This is a frivolous application and an abuse of process of court. As I\n                        said earlier on 7 September 2009. SUM4258/2009 – the\n                        application for security for costs – was entered into by consent\n                        before AR Daphne Chang, whereby both parties agreed that Plaintiff was to\n                        provide security within 7 days (i.e. 3 September 2009). It lies foul in\n                        Plaintiff’s mouth to state that the unless order application was\n                        unreasonable given that trial was originally to be fixed on\n                        14 September but for Plaintiff’s conduct (Plaintiff has not even\n                        set down the action for trial!). I also note that this is the second unless\n                        order made by this court against Plaintiff – the first was on\n                        29 July 2009 whereby AR Jeyendran Jeyapal ordered Plaintiff to file and\n                        exchange the AEIC. Plaintiff’s contumelious conduct cannot and will\n                        not be tolerated by this court. 11     It is to be noted that the AR had found the\n                    plaintiff’s conductprior tothe making of\n                    the unless order of 7 September 2009 contumelious and intolerable. However,\n                    the AR did not refer to the actions the plaintiff had taken to comply with the\n                    unless order of 7 September 2009, and did not make any finding that it was\n                    the result of the plaintiff’s contumely. That being the case, the failure\n                    of the plaintiff to appeal against the AR’s refusal to set aside the\n                    judgment entered cannot be regarded as its acceptance that its non-compliance\n                    with the unless order was contumelious, and does not bar the plaintiff from\n                    asserting that it was not contumelious. 12     The defendant’s application to strike\n                    out the originating summons was heard on 14 July 2010, and dismissed on\n                    22 July 2010. The defendant was not satisfied with the order, and brought\n                    the present appeal.",
        "Preliminary issue": "13     There is a preliminary issue of whether the\n                    present action is based on the same cause of action as Suit 764. The\n                    defendant’s application was founded on the contention that it was. The\n                    plaintiff, however, argued that it was not. 14     This issue can be dealt with quite simply. A\n                    cause of action is “[a] factual situation the existence of which entitles\n                    one person to obtain from the court a remedy against another person” per\n                    Diplock LJ,Letang v Cooper[1965] 1 QB 232 at\n                    242–243. It is clear beyond sensible disagreement that both the actions\n                    brought by the plaintiff proceeded on the defendant’s alleged trade mark\n                    infringement and passing off against the plaintiff’s\n                    “SUBWAY” trade mark. The plaintiff’s former attorney and\n                    in-house counsel, Valerie Pochron, had deposed in an affidavit filed on\n                    2 July 2010 in the present action that: 13.The Plaintiffs initiated a fresh proceeding\n                            against the Defendant in OS No.462 of 2010/Q (“OS 462”)\n                            since Suit 764 was never tried by the Court and thus remains unresolved,\n                            and that the Plaintiffs verily believe that there are substantial issues\n                            to be tried in this matter which were prevented from being heard in the\n                            Court due to procedural defaults. The plaintiff’s contention that the present action as a\n                    distinct cause of action is a futile attempt to deny the simple fact that it was\n                    the same cause of action,ie, that the\n                    defendant’s use of the Subway Niche trade mark was an infringement and\n                    passing off of the plaintiff’s SUBWAY trade mark.",
        "The law": "15     A party’s right to commence action after\n                    a previous similar action has been struck out for the failure to comply with a\n                    peremptory order has been discussed and settled by the Court of Appeal inChanghe International Investments Pte Ltd (formerly known\n                        as Druidstone Pte Ltd) v Dexia BIL Asia Singapore Ltd (formerly known as\n                        Banque Internationale A Luxembourg BIL (Asia) Ltd)[2005] 3\n                    SLR(R) 344 (“Changhe”) where it held\n                    at [6]: Since the 1980s, it has been settled law that the court has the discretion\n                        to strike out an action as an abuse of process of the court where there had\n                        been a failure by a litigant to comply with a peremptory order of the court\n                        in a previous action. It referred to the landmark English decisions inJanov v Morris[1981] 1 WLR 1389 andSamuels\n                        v Linzi Dresses Ltd[1981] QB 115 and the Court of Appeal’s\n                    decision inSyed Mohamed Abdul Muthaliff v Arjan Bhisham\n                        Chotrani[1999] 1 SLR(R) 361 (“Syed\n                        Mohamed”) and concluded at [11] that: [I]t is established law that where a litigant, whose first action has been\n                        struck out for failure to comply with a peremptory order, brings a second\n                        suit based on the same cause of action, that second suit may be struck out\n                        as being an abuse of the process of the court unless the litigant can give a\n                        proper explanation to establish that hisfailure to\n                            comply with the peremptory orderwas not contumelious. It\n                        should be noted thatTolley v Morris[[1979] 1\n                        WLR 592] also stands for the principle that disobedience to a peremptory\n                        order would generally amount to contumelious conduct. [emphasis added] 16     InSyed Mohamedthe Court of Appeal gave thought to the meaning of “contumelious”\n                    and “contumacious”. It referred to the judgment of Sir John Megaw\n                    inJokai Tea Holdings Ltd[1992] 1 WLR 1196 which\n                    went back to where the root words of “contumelious” and\n                    “contumacious” were. The judge’s definition of\n                    “contumely” as “insolent reproach or abuse” and\n                    “contumacy” as “perverse and obstinate resistance to\n                    authority” were accepted without qualification, and\n                    “contumelious” and “contumacious” must be construed\n                    in accordance to those definitions. 17     The Court of Appeal inChanghewent on to add at [10] that: [I]n cases in which it had to decide what were to be the consequences of a\n                        failure to comply with an unless order, the relevant question was whether\n                        such failure was intentional and contumelious. The court should not be\n                        astute to find excuses for such failure since obedience to orders of the\n                        court was the foundation on which its authority rested. The crux of the\n                        matter was that the party seeking to escape the consequences of his default\n                        would have to show that the failure was not contumelious because he had made\n                        positive efforts to comply but was prevented from doing so by extraneous\n                        circumstances, and that he had no intention of ignoring or flouting the\n                        order. and the Court then found at [27] that the party would have to show that its disobedience in\n                    respect of an earlier peremptory order was “not contumelious in that it\n                    was not intentional and arose from an extraneous circumstance over which [it]\n                    had no control.” 18     The law can be summarised as follows: (a)the disobedience of a peremptory order which\n                            resulted in the striking out of an action would generally be regarded as\n                            contumelious, and(b)a party whose first action has been struck out\n                            for the failure to comply with a peremptory order may bring a second\n                            action on the same cause of action if it can show that the failure to\n                            comply with the peremptory order was not contumelious in the sense that\n                            it was not intentional and it arose from extraneous circumstances over\n                            which the party has no control.The burden on the plaintiff19     The plaintiff has the burden to show that its\n                    failure to comply with the Order of Court of 7 September 2009 which led to\n                    the striking out of the first action was not contumelious in that it was not\n                    intentional, and had arose from an extraneous circumstances over which it had no\n                    control.20     The burden on the plaintiff, or any party in a\n                    similar position, is to show that despite the earlier action being struck out,\n                    it should be allowed to proceed with a second action. As the critical factor is\n                    that the previous action was struck out because of its failure to comply with a\n                    peremptory order, the reason for that failure is the primary matter for\n                    consideration. I make this observation because the defendant had referred to the\n                    conduct of the plaintiff before and leading to the making of the consent order\n                    of 26 August 2009 and the unless order of 7 September 2009. Under the\n                    law as set out inChanghe, such matters are not\n                    relevant in determining whether the second action should also be struck out.\n                    While they may have been taken into consideration for the making of the unless\n                    order, it is thenon-compliance with the unless\n                        order, and not the previous conduct, that led to the striking out\n                    of the action. The Court of Appeal had made it clear inChanghethat the party had to explain its non-compliance with\n                    the unless order (and only that order).Has the plaintiff discharged the burden?21     The plaintiff did not comply with the unless\n                    order of 7 September 2009 to furnish the security by noon 10 September\n                    2009. The time for compliance was only two and a half days, an unusually and\n                    impractically short time for the plaintiff in America to arrange for a Singapore\n                    bank to issue the guarantee and for it to be delivered to the defendant’s\n                    solicitors.22     Valerie Pochron affirmed an affidavit on\n                    12 October 2009 in Suit 764 to explain the plaintiff’s failure to\n                    furnish the banker’s guarantee in time. In her affidavit, she deposed\n                    that:I am verily advised by the Account Department of the Plaintiffs that the\n                        procedure for in [sic] order to obtain a bank guarantee in Singapore the\n                        estimated time frame is 4 to 5 weeks from request to completion.and added that:In this case, and as outlined above, the Plaintiffs have not been tardy or\n                        contumelious in respect of obtaining the Banker’s guarantee. It is due\n                        to administrative difficulties that the Plaintiffs have not been able to\n                        comply with the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar.She also exhibited a banker’s guarantee issued by the Hongkong\n                    and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited to the defendant dated\n                    18 September 2009 for the sum of $39,000.00. Counsel for the defendant\n                    pointed out that the guarantee in fact did not take four to five weeks to be\n                    issued, and the guarantee of 18 September 2009 was obtained within nine\n                    days from the date of the unless order.23     It should also be noted that Valerie Pochron\n                    did not state the time and the steps the plaintiff took to apply for the\n                    guarantee. The only evidence available is in her email to the plaintiff’s\n                    solicitors dated 9 September 2009 where she informed them:Our accounting department is working as best they can, but are\n                        encountering issues with the bank and getting the additional funds into the\n                        Bank Guarantee. The funds are available, but needless to say it has not yet\n                        been transferred into the form of a Bank Guarantee.Our\n                            accounting department is doing everything it can to comply with the\n                            order, but I cannot be assured that it will be in place by\n                        the 10th.[emphasis added]That could be the reason the guarantee was issued in nine days instead\n                    of four to five weeks.24     On the basis of the available evidence, I\n                    accept that it was difficult for the plaintiff to comply with the exceptionally\n                    tight time-line imposed. The fact that the plaintiff obtained the guarantee on\n                    18 September 2009 is evidence that its failure to furnish the bank\n                    guarantee in time did not arise out of contumely, or even\n                contumacy.25     The plaintiff’s willingness and\n                    readiness to furnish security is further affirmed in an affidavit filed in the\n                    present proceedings on 2 July 2010 by Max Ng, a director of the law\n                    corporation acting for the plaintiff, in which he confirmed that the plaintiff\n                    had placed with the corporation $40,000.00 to ensure that should there be a\n                    similar requirement for security, the plaintiff will be able to comply in\n                    time.26     Against the background of the evidence, I find\n                    that the plaintiff has shown that its failure to comply with the unless order of\n                    9 September 2009 did not arise from its contumely but because of the very\n                    tight time-line. The plaintiff’s production of the guarantee, albeit out\n                    of time, and the placement of $40,000.00 with its solicitors to ensure that it\n                    is able to comply with any future order for security corroborated the\n                    plaintiff’s plea that it had always wanted to comply with the unless\n                    order.Conclusion27     The plaintiff should be allowed to proceed\n                    with its present action so that the issues of trade mark infringement and\n                    passing off can be determined on their merits. The failure to comply with the\n                    unless order should not disentitle the plaintiff from proceeding to have these\n                    matters determined.28     The defendant’s appeal is dismissed with\n                    costs.",
        "The burden on the plaintiff": "19     The plaintiff has the burden to show that its\n                    failure to comply with the Order of Court of 7 September 2009 which led to\n                    the striking out of the first action was not contumelious in that it was not\n                    intentional, and had arose from an extraneous circumstances over which it had no\n                    control. 20     The burden on the plaintiff, or any party in a\n                    similar position, is to show that despite the earlier action being struck out,\n                    it should be allowed to proceed with a second action. As the critical factor is\n                    that the previous action was struck out because of its failure to comply with a\n                    peremptory order, the reason for that failure is the primary matter for\n                    consideration.

        "Has the plaintiff discharged the burden?": "21     The plaintiff did not comply with the unless\n                    order of 7 September 2009 to furnish the security by noon 10 September\n                    2009. The time for compliance was only two and a half days, an unusually and\n                    impractically short time for the plaintiff in America to arrange for a Singapore\n                    bank to issue the guarantee and for it to be delivered to the defendant’s\n                    solicitors. 22     Valerie Pochron affirmed an affidavit on\n                    12 October 2009 in Suit 764 to explain the plaintiff’s failure to\n                    furnish the banker’s guarantee in time. In her affidavit, she deposed\n                    that: I am verily advised by the Account Department of the Plaintiffs that the\n                        procedure for in [sic] order to obtain a bank guarantee in Singapore the\n                        estimated time frame is 4 to 5 weeks from request to completion. and added that: In this case, and as outlined above, the Plaintiffs have not been tardy or\n                        contumelious in respect of obtaining the Banker’s guarantee. It is due\n                        to administrative difficulties that the Plaintiffs have not been able to\n                        comply with the orders made by the learned Assistant Registrar. She also exhibited a banker’s guarantee issued by the Hongkong\n                    and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited to the defendant dated\n                    18 September 2009 for the sum of $39,000.00. Counsel for the defendant\n                    pointed out that the guarantee in fact did not take four to five weeks to be\n                    issued, and the guarantee of 18 September 2009 was obtained within nine\n                    days from the date of the unless order. 23     It should also be noted that Valerie Pochron\n                    did not state the time and the steps the plaintiff took to apply for the\n                    guarantee. The only evidence available is in her email to the plaintiff’s\n                    solicitors dated 9 September 2009 where she informed them: Our accounting department is working as best they can, but are\n                        encountering issues with the bank and getting the additional funds into the\n                        Bank Guarantee. The funds are available, but needless to say it has not yet\n                        been transferred into the form of a Bank Guarantee.Our\n                            accounting department is doing everything it can to comply with the\n                            order, but I cannot be assured that it will be in place by\n                        the 10th. [emphasis added] That could be the reason the guarantee was issued in nine days instead\n                    of four to five weeks. 24     On the basis of the available evidence, I\n                    accept that it was difficult for the plaintiff to comply with the exceptionally\n                    tight time-line imposed. The fact that the plaintiff obtained the guarantee on\n                    18 September 2009 is evidence that its failure to furnish the bank\n                    guarantee in time did not arise out of contumely, or even\n                contumacy. 25     The plaintiff’s willingness and\n                    readiness to furnish security is further affirmed in an affidavit filed in the\n                    present proceedings on 2 July 2010 by Max Ng, a director of the law\n                    corporation acting for the plaintiff, in which he confirmed that the plaintiff\n                    had placed with the corporation $40,000.00 to ensure that should there be a\n                    similar requirement for security, the plaintiff will be able to comply in\n                    time. 26     Against the background of the evidence, I find\n                    that the plaintiff has shown that its failure to comply with the unless order of\n                    9 September 2009 did not arise from its contumely but because of the very\n                    tight time-line. The plaintiff’s production of the guarantee, albeit out\n                    of time, and the placement of $40,000.00 with its solicitors to ensure that it\n                    is able to comply with any future order for security corroborated the\n                    plaintiff’s plea that it had always wanted to comply with the unless\n                    order.",
        "Conclusion": "27     The plaintiff should be allowed to proceed\n                    with its present action so that the issues of trade mark infringement and\n                    passing off can be determined on their merits. The failure to comply with the\n                    unless order should not disentitle the plaintiff from proceeding to have these\n                    matters determined. 28     The defendant’s appeal is dismissed with\n                    costs."
