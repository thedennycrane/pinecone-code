        "The decision of the court": "7       The High Court “shallon the application of the Public Prosecutor, reserve for the decision of the Court of Appeal any question of law of public interest which has arisen in the matter and the determination of which by the Judge has affected the case” (s 60(1) SCJA)(emphasis added). Section 60(5) provides that “any question of law which the Public Prosecutor applies to be reserved … shall be deemed to be a question of public interest”. The court therefore has no discretion where an application under s60 is taken out by the Public Prosecutor. Accordingly, I grant the order sought in Criminal Motion No. 45 of 2009. 8       Where Criminal Motion No. 44 of 2009 is concerned, bearing in mind the majority’s views in the Court of Appeal and guided by their pronouncements, especially their observations at [87] of the judgment (set out in[4]above), I also grant the order sought in Criminal Motion No. 44 of 2009. I would add that whether or not the questions raised by BMS are reserved, they will have to be canvassed in the course of argument and will probably have to be dealt with by the Court of Appeal anyway. As acknowledged by the prosecution, there is some overlap between both parties’ questions in any event. 9       The existing bail for BMS is extended until further order by the Court of Appeal. 10     The prosecution has been asked by me to draft a joint referral to the Court of Appeal setting out both parties’ questions."
