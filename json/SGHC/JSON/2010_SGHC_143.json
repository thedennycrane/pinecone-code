        "Introduction": "1       This application to show cause arose from a\n                    complaint to the Law Society of Singapore (“the Law Society”)\n                    against the respondent, an advocate and solicitor of some 16 years’\n                    standing (“the Respondent”), by one\n                    Mdm Sumathi d/o S Ramachandran (“the\n                    Complainant”). According to the Complainant, a teacher at a Singapore\n                    primary school (“the School”), the Respondent had threatened and\n                    abused her verbally during a private meeting at the School (“the\n                    Meeting”). The Meeting had been specifically convened to resolve certain\n                    issues relating to the Respondent’s younger sister, a pupil at the\n                    School. 2       After a two-day hearing in September, the\n                    Disciplinary Tribunal rendered its report on 30 November 2009 (“the\n                    Report”). In it, the Disciplinary Tribunal stated that the\n                    Respondent’s conduct, although not occurring in her professional capacity,\n                    nonetheless constituted cause of sufficient gravity pursuant to\n                        s 93(1)(c) of the Legal Profession Act\n                    (Cap 161, 2009 Rev Ed) (“the Act”) so as to warrant a\n                    reference to this court. The Disciplinary Tribunal further stated in its Report\n                    (at [38]) that it did not possess the discretion torefrainfrom referring matters to the court of\n                    three Judges, once all the elements of a disciplinary charge had been made\n                    out. 3       We were not concerned with the substantive\n                    merits of the Law Society’s case against the Respondent. Instead, on a\n                    preliminary issue, we agreed with the views of both the Law Society and the\n                    Respondent that the Disciplinary Tribunal had misdirected itself in fettering\n                    its own discretion to deal with the Respondent’s misconduct. Indeed, for\n                    the reasons set out below, this application was misconceived and, in fact,\n                    referred inappropriately by the Disciplinary Tribunal to this court. Before we\n                    proceed to consider these reasons, however, a brief summary of the procedural\n                    history of the case would be in order.",
        "Procedural history": "4       On 4 September 2008, the Complainant lodged\n                    a complaint with the Law Society in respect of the Respondent’s alleged\n                    misconduct at the Meeting. Subsequently, the Law Society preferred the following\n                    charge (“the Charge”) against the Respondent: Charge You, Jasmine Gowrimani d/o Daniel, Admission No. 250/1994\n                        are charged that you, being an Advocate and Solicitor of the Supreme Court\n                        of the Republic of Singapore, had conducted yourself in a manner that\n                        amounts to misconduct unbefitting of an Advocate and Solicitor as an officer\n                        of the Supreme Court or as a member of an honourable profession within the\n                        meaning of Section 83(2)(h) of the Legal Profession Act\n                        (Chapter 161), to wit, by threatening to ensure that [the Complainant]\n                        “will not be in the teaching profession anymore”; by banging\n                        your fist on the table and the door of the meeting room; and by uttering the\n                        following abusive words to [the Complainant], during a meeting at [the\n                        School] on 15 July 2008:- a.    “She is such a swine” (shouted\n                            twice); b.    “I don’t know how many husbands you\n                            have but our own family ladies doesn’t (sic) roll round with men” (at least once);\n                            and c.    “This woman cannot have one father; she must\n                            have several fathers”. 5       On 18 May 2009, the Disciplinary Tribunal\n                    was appointed to hear and investigate the complaint against the Respondent.\n                    After a two-day hearing on 22 and 23 September 2009, the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal submitted the Report on 30 November 2009. 6       Apart from making certain findings of fact that\n                    this court is presently not concerned with, the Disciplinary Tribunal also\n                    pronounced on the issue of its own discretion to refer – ornotto refer – cases to the court of\n                    three Judges. The Disciplinary Tribunal stated (at [38] of the Report) as\n                    follows: There is an intriguing discussion in the article “Show Cause Proceedings Before the Court of Three Judges: Some\n                            Procedural Questions” (2008) 20 SAcLJ 801\n                        (at [37]-[47]) by Goh Yihan, concerning whether a Disciplinary Committee\n                        [presently known as the Disciplinary Tribunal] can determine that there is\n                        no cause of sufficient gravitydespitefinding\n                        the respondent guilty of all the ingredients of “due cause”\n                        under s 83(2) of the Act. According to the learned author,Disciplinary Committees have in the past taken the view that\n                            although all the ingredients of the charge under s 83(2) of the Act\n                            are fulfilled, they nonetheless have the power to take into account\n                            mitigating factors so as to find that no cause of sufficient gravity\n                            existed. He says that this is a “prevalent\n                            practice”. We would have adopted this practice and\n                        invoked s 93(1)(b) of the Act in the present case. Whilst we have taken\n                        a dim view of the Respondent’s conduct in relation to the Meeting, it\n                        may be said that the conduct was not of such gravity or seriousness as to\n                        necessitate referring it to the Court of Three Judges and that a stern\n                        reprimand or an appropriate penalty seems apt. For sure, the conduct is\n                        quite removed from that end of the spectrum of human frailties where\n                        dishonesty and moral turpitude reside.However, we are\n                            persuaded by the contention in the article that, as provided in\n                            s 83 of the Act, all advocates and solicitors are ultimately\n                            subject to the control of the court and that when a charge under\n                            s 83(2) of the Act is made out (that is, “due cause”\n                            is established), a finding of cause of sufficient gravity for\n                            disciplinary action is mandated under s 93(1) of the Act and the\n                            Disciplinary Tribunal has no power or discretion to nevertheless find\n                            that no such cause exists. Nevertheless, we agree with the\n                        learned author that the position should be clarified by the Court of Three\n                        Judges. [emphasis added] 7       Put simply, it appears that the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal decided that, based on the arguments advanced by Goh Yihan\n                    (“Goh”) in his article (as cited by the Disciplinary Tribunal in\n                    the Report (see the preceding paragraph)), “Show Cause Proceedings Before\n                    the Court of Three Judges: Some Procedural Questions” (2008)\n                    20 SAcLJ 801 (“the Article”) (at\n                    paras 37–47), it had no choice but to refer the matter of the\n                    Respondent’s misconduct to the court of three Judges once the\n                    elements of the Charge had been made out. From the Disciplinary Tribunal’s\n                    perspective, pursuant to ss 93(1)(c) and\n                    94(1) of the Act, once “due cause” had been made out – in\n                    this case under s 83(2)(h) of the Act –\n                    it would havenodiscretionnotto transmit the Respondent’s case\n                upwards. 8       The rationale for Goh’s view is set out\n                    primarily at paras 40–41, 45 and 47 of the Article, as\n                    follows: 40    The issue here is whether there is a difference\n                            between the expressions “no cause of sufficient gravity”\n                            and “due cause”, such that while the solicitor concerned\n                            is found to be guilty of all the ingredients of a “due\n                            cause” under s 83, he nonetheless can escape the\n                            disciplinary powers of the Court of Three Judges should the\n                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] decide that there was “no cause of\n                            sufficient gravity”. The distinction is further borne out by\n                            provisions such as ss 93(1)(b) and 94(3), which appear to\n                            distinguish the meanings between “due cause” and\n                            “no cause of sufficient gravity”. Put another way, these\n                            sections seem to suggest that while there may well be a\n                            “cause”, this can either be “not of sufficient\n                            gravity” or“of sufficient\n                                gravity”, in which case it is a “due\n                                cause”. The question must then be asked: Is this a\n                            conceptually sustainable distinction bearing in mind the framework\n                            (quite apart from theliteralsense) of\n                            the statute? 41Prima facie, it is\n                            submitted that this interpretation (ie,\n                            the distinction outlined)cannotbe\n                            conceptually supported. In the first place, s 83(1) of the LPA\n                            states expressly that all advocates and solicitors “shall be subject to the control of the Supreme\n                                Court”. It does not say that all advocates and\n                            solicitors are subject to the self-regulatory disciplinary framework of\n                            their peers,ie, the [Disciplinary\n                            Tribunal]. By not referring an advocate and solicitor who has been found\n                            guilty of a charge formulated pursuant to s 83(2) of the LPA, the\n                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] is in effectusurpingthe disciplinary powers of the Court of Three\n                            Judges. Taken to its logical conclusion, a solicitor guilty of a\n                            grievous “due cause” (for which the Court of Three Judges\n                            will surely impose a heavy sentence) can escape the consequences of his\n                            actions if the [Disciplinary Tribunal] nonetheless decides that\n                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” exists. This cannot be\n                            the case since the purpose of the Court of Three Judges is to\n                            “vest ultimate control of the discipline of advocates and\n                            solicitors in the court in order to provide a measure of independence\n                            and impartiality”. … 45    [I]t is submitted that the [Disciplinary Tribunal],\n                            upon finding that the respondent isguiltyof the charge against her, which encompassesall the ingredientsof a “due\n                            cause” under s 83(2)(e), should have proceeded to refer the case\n                            to the Court of Three Judges, without more. In other words, the words\n                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” only apply to cases where\n                            there is no “due cause”, and this is when the objective\n                            ingredients of the specified due causes under s 83(2) are not made\n                            out. There is no middle ground wherein the [Disciplinary Tribunal] can\n                            find that there isa “due cause” (or\n                                rather, that the ingredients of a “due cause” are made\n                                out)but yet, in itssubjectivedetermination, decide that this is\n                            “not of sufficient gravity”. It is further submitted that\n                            the [Disciplinary Tribunal] should not determine that there was\n                            “no cause of sufficient gravity” when “due\n                            cause” was clearly shown to exist under s 83(2)(e), bearing\n                            in mind that it is the Court of Three Judges in which ultimate\n                            disciplinary powers are emplaced. If anything, it is for the Court of\n                            Three Judges to decide whether the respondent’s conduct,while falling within one of the “due\n                                causes”, merits lesser punishment. The residual\n                            powers for the [Disciplinary Tribunal] to award lesser punishment under\n                            provisions such as ss 93(1)(b) and 94(3), it is submitted, apply\n                            only when there is no “due cause” and yet the\n                            [Disciplinary Tribunal] is of the opinion that the respondent’s\n                            conduct is nonetheless reprehensible and is deserving of some\n                            sanction. … 47    The problem, it seems, is that certain\n                            [Disciplinary Tribunals] have taken the view that although the elements\n                            of a charge formulated under instances of “due cause” in s\n                            83(2) are fulfilled, they nonetheless have the power to take into\n                            account mitigating factors so as to find that “no cause of\n                            sufficient gravity” existed. With respect, this may not be\n                            correct.Surely it is the Court of Three Judges\n                                which determines how those mitigating factors come into play? The\n                                task of the [Disciplinary Tribunal], when it has found that a charge\n                                under s 83(2) is made out, and hence “due cause”\n                                shown, must surely be to defer to the Court of Three Judges to\n                                decide on the proper sanction to be meted out on the errant\n                                solicitor. It should not take it upon its own hands and\n                            take the matter out of the hands of the Court of Three\n                        Judges. [original emphasis in italics; emphasis added in bold italics] 9       Goh’s view, which the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal accepted, is that a finding of “due cause” under\n                    s 83 wouldnecessarilyimply (indeed, entail)\n                    a “cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action” under\n                    ss 93 and 94. In other words, Goh hasequatedthe two expressions (see the Article at paras 40–41, excerpted at[8]above). Accordingly, as the\n                    Disciplinary Tribunal had, in the present proceedings, found that the elements\n                    of the Charge against the Respondent had been made out pursuant to\n                        s 83(2)(h) of the Act, it had no choice\n                    but to refer the Respondent’s matter onwards to this court. This wasdespitethe Disciplinary Tribunal’sown conclusionthat “the\n                    [Respondent’s] conduct … was not of such gravity or seriousness as\n                    to necessitate referring it to the Court of Three Judges” (see the Report\n                    at [38]). 10     With respect, the approach adopted by both Goh\n                    and the Disciplinary Tribunal shouldnotbe\n                    adopted.",
        "The issue": "11     Broadly speaking, the issue we are concerned\n                    with here is whether the Disciplinary Tribunal has adiscretionto refer cases to the court of three Judges, having\n                    found that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one\n                    or more of the limbs in s 83(2) (in other words, the elements of the charge\n                    against the advocate and solicitor have been made out). In our view, it is clear\n                    that this issue turns, to a large extent, on whether there is a distinction\n                    between the phrase “cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\n                    exists under [s 83]” in ss 93 and 94 of the Act on the one hand\n                    and the phrase “due cause” in s 83 of the Act on the other.\n                    It would also turn on whether a finding that the conduct of the advocate and\n                    solicitor concerned falls within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2)\n                    automatically amounts to a finding of “due cause” under s 83,\n                    as well as the roles played by the court of three Judges and the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal, respectively.",

        "Presumption that different words have different meanings": "15     We commence with the two phrases mentioned at[11]and the logical and commonsensical\n                    presumption that different words have different meanings. Indeed, even the same\n                    word may have a different meaning, especially in a different context. We are\n                    here faced with two completely different phrases,viz, “cause of sufficient gravity exists under\n                    [s 83]” and “due cause”, respectively. They occur in a\n                    piece of legislation – indeed, the same piece of legislation. We can,\n                    therefore, start with the presumption that they were intended to have different\n                    meanings. This leads us to the next point – centring on the relevantlegislative history.",
        "Legislative history and purpose": "The positionprior tothe Legal\n                Profession (Amendment) Act 1970 16     Prior to the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act\n                    1970 (Act 16 of 1970) (“the 1970 Amendment Act”), there\n                    wasonly onephrase utilised in the Act,viz, “due cause”. Indeed, this particular\n                    phrase was, in fact, the precise phrase used at the relevant points in s 93\n                    (the then s 96) and, indeed, throughoutallthe relevant provisions reproduced above (at[13]and[14]). In\n                    particular, s 93(1) (which was then numbered as s 96(1)), in itsoriginallanguagepriorto the 1970 Amendment Act, read as follows: 96. -\n                        (1)   After hearing and investigating any matter referred to\n                        it the Disciplinary Committee shall record its findings in relation to the\n                        facts of the case and according to those facts shall determine - (a)   thatdue causedoes not exist for disciplinary action under\n                                section 87of this Act [the present s 83 of the Act]\n                            or for a penalty under paragraph (b) of this subsection; or (b)   that whileno sufficient causeexists for disciplinary action under section\n                                87of this Act the advocate and solicitorshould be ordered to pay a penalty under section 98 of\n                                this Act; or (c)   thatdue causeexists for disciplinary action under\n                                section 87of this Act. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] The positionafterthe 1970 Amendment\n                Act 17     However, s 31 of the 1970 Amendment\n                    Act amended the provision set out in the preceding paragraph, which thereafter\n                    read as follows: 96. -\n                        (1)   After hearing and investigating any matter referred to\n                        it the Disciplinary Committee shall record its findings in relation to the\n                        facts of the case and according to those facts shall determine - (a)   thatno cause of sufficient\n                                gravityfor disciplinary action exists under\n                                section 87of this Act [the present s 83 of the\n                            Act]; or (b)   that whileno cause of\n                                sufficient gravityfor disciplinary action exists under the said\n                                section 87, the advocate and solicitorshould be reprimanded; or (c)   thatcause of sufficient\n                                gravityfor disciplinary action exists under the said\n                                section 87. [emphasis added in italics and bold italics] 18     Indeed, the words – or, more accurately,\n                    the change in the words and the terminology - speak for\n                    themselves. In particular, the phrase “cause of sufficient\n                    gravity” replaced the phrase “due cause” in the then\n                    s 96(1) of the Act (which is the present s 93(1) of the Act,\n                    reproduced above at[13]). In this\n                    connection, it should be borne in mind, of course, that the phrase “cause\n                    of sufficient gravity” relates todisciplinary action\n                        under the then s 87 of the Act(the\n                        present s 83 of the Act, the material parts of which have\n                    been reproduced above at[14]). This\n                    last-mentioned point is important inasmuch as both ss 87(1)(b) and 88(1) of the Actalsoutilise the phrase “cause of sufficient\n                    gravity”,albeit in relation to the absence of the\n                        need for a “formal investigation” by a Disciplinary\n                        Tribunal(see both ss 87(1)(b)\n                    and 88(1) where the phrase “nocause of sufficient\n                        gravityexists for aformal\n                        investigation” is employed). 19     Put simply, and returning to the issue at\n                    hand, the legislative history demonstrates – in no uncertain terms\n                        - that the phrase “cause of sufficient\n                    gravity” was not only intended to replace the phrase “due\n                    cause” in the context of proceedings beforea\n                        Disciplinary Tribunal but was also intended to carry a quite different\n                        meaning from the phrase “due cause”. This is, in\n                    fact, an appropriate juncture at which to turn to the next (related) question:\n                    What, then,wasthelegislative\n                        purposeunderlying this particular amendment (and the consequent\n                    substitution of phrases)? The parliamentary materials 20     There does not appear to be anyexpressdelineation of the legislative purpose for the\n                    changes effected. In theExplanatory Statementto\n                    the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill 6 of 1970) (which was\n                    ultimately enacted as the 1970 Amendment Act), it was stated as\n                    follows: The Legal Profession Act, 1966, introduced a large number of novel\n                        provisions. It has been found in the light of the operation of the Act that\n                        certain amendments would be desirable for the more efficient organisation of\n                        the legal profession and also to take into account the functions of other\n                        professions, such as public accountants. This Bill seeks to make such\n                        amendments as are necessary to give effect to such changes. 21     Morespecifically, theExplanatory\n                        Statementalso elaborated on cl 31 of this Bill (which was\n                    ultimately enacted as s 31 of the 1970 Amendment Act, which amended the\n                    then s 96(1) of the Act (the present s 93(1)) (see[17]above)), as follows: The Bill also enlarges the powers of the Disciplinary Committee and the\n                        Inquiry Committee.As a result of these amendments the\n                            Disciplinary Committee can reprimand an advocate and solicitor when the\n                            case against him is not of sufficient gravity but it cannot in such\n                            cases order payment of a penalty (clause 31). [emphasis\n                        added] 22     Hence, the focus of s 31 of the\n                    1970 Amendment Act was, as just noted in the preceding paragraph, on\n                    enlarging the power of the (then) Disciplinary Committee inasmuch as it could\n                    reprimand an advocate and solicitor (but not order the payment of a penalty),\n                    despite finding that no cause of sufficient gravity for disciplinary action\n                    existed. 23     The more interestingconsequentialamendments in the context of the present\n                    proceedings lie in the fact that the phrase “sufficientcause” in s 96(1)(b) (the present s 93(1)(b))\n                    wasreplaced bythe phrase “cause of\n                    sufficientgravity”. Further, the phrase\n                        “due cause” in\n                        s 96(1)(a)and(c) (the present\n                        s 93(1)(a) and (c), respectively) wasreplaced bythe phrase “cause of sufficient gravity” (see[17]above).However, there appears to benoexplanation in either theExplanatory Statementto\n                    the Bill concerned or in the relevant Parliament Debates (see generallySingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official\n                        Report(30 March 1970) vol 29 at\n                    cols 1271–1273 (Mr E W Barker, Minister for Law and\n                    National Development)) as towhytheseconsequentialamendments were made. The only clear fact\n                    is the change of the phrases themselves. Henceforth, the Disciplinary Committee\n                    (now Disciplinary Tribunal) would be concerned with whether or not there has\n                    been “cause of sufficient gravity”for disciplinary action against the advocate and solicitor\n                        concerned pursuant to s 83– as opposed to\n                        “due cause” (which constituted\n                    the previous position (prior tothe\n                    1970 Amendment Act)).",
        "The roles played by the court of three Judges and the Disciplinary\n                Tribunal": "The court of three Judges bears the ultimate responsibility for\n                deciding on the most serious cases of misconduct 24     It would, in the circumstances, therefore be\n                    useful to commence our analysis from first principles. And one such principle is\n                    thatthe Supreme Courtin general and the court of\n                    three Judges in particular (see s 98(7) of the Act) bear the ultimate\n                    responsibility for deciding on the most serious cases of misconduct by advocates\n                    and solicitors. Indeed, this is embodied in s 83(1) of the Act. Although\n                    that provision has already been reproduced above (at[14]), it is worth reproducing again: “All advocates and\n                    solicitors shall be subject to the control of the Supreme Court …”\n                    (reference may also be made to s 82A(2) of the Act, which relates to the\n                    equivalent provision in the context of disciplinary proceedings against legal\n                    service officers and non-practising solicitors). The starting point, therefore,\n                    is that the Supreme Court (in the form of the court of three Judges) is theultimatetribunal having control over all\n                    advocates and solicitors. However, it should be appreciated that it doesnotfollow fromthisfactper sethat the court of\n                    three Judgesmustnecessarily hearallcases where the Disciplinary Tribunal finds that the\n                    advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of the limbs of\n                    s 83(2) of the Act (cfpara 41 of the\n                    Article, excerpted at[8]above). In our\n                    view, it is only themost serious casesthat must\n                    be heard by the court of three Judges. That the Supreme Court (in the form of\n                    the court of three Judges) is theultimate (and\n                        only)tribunal for deciding on themost\n                        serious casesis borne out by the fact that it is also accorded\n                    (in s 83(1) of the Act (reproduced above at[14])) the power to administer themost\n                        serious sanctionsagainst an errant advocate and solicitor. This\n                    power includes administering the most severe sanction of striking such an\n                    advocate and solicitor off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme\n                    Court. It is also important to note that there isno further\n                        appealfrom such a decision (see s 98(7) of the\n                Act). 25     At this juncture, it should be further noted\n                    that it isfor the court of three Judges to decide and\n                        it must decide on whether or not “due cause” has been proved\n                        in the first instance; in other words,the\n                        mere referenceof a case to the court of three Judges isnotafait\n                        accompliin so far as theliabilityof the advocate and solicitor is concerned. This is an important point, to which\n                    we shall return below. The role of the Disciplinary Tribunal (1)   The Disciplinary Tribunal is not responsible for deciding\n                upon the most serious cases 26     The upshot of what has just been discussed in\n                    the preceding section is thatthe Disciplinary\n                        Tribunaldoesnotpossess powers to\n                    decide upon themost serious cases,let aloneadminister themost serious\n                        sanctions. As we have seen, this is the task of the court of\n                    three Judges. Put simply, it isnottheultimatedisciplinary tribunal. What, then,isthefunctionofthe Disciplinary Tribunalpursuant to s 93\n                    (reproduced above at[13])?This is, in fact, one of the most crucial questions to be answered\n                        in the context of the present proceedings. 27     Thefunction(or\n                    rather, functions) ofthe Disciplinary Tribunalmay be gleaned from the relevant provisions of the Act itself. (2)   The Disciplinary Tribunal as a\n                “filter” 28     One main function of the Disciplinary Tribunal\n                    isto serve as a “filter” of sorts, thereby\n                        ensuring that only the most serious complaints are referred to the court of\n                        three Judges. This is, in fact, clear from the provisions of\n                    s 93 itself (reproduced above at[13]).\n                    It is of the first importance to reiterate that the Disciplinary Tribunal doesnot decideon the most serious cases. If it\n                    decides that a particular complaint is sufficiently seriousandthat there is aprima faciecase against the advocate and solicitor concerned after hearing the relevant\n                    evidence, the Disciplinary Tribunal mustreferthe\n                    casefor decision by the court of\n                        three Judges. On the other hand, it is both logical as well\n                    as commonsensical that the court of three Judgesnotbe “clogged up” with hearing cases of a\n                    trivial (and,a fortiori, frivolous) nature.\n                    Indeed, the same approach with a view to avoiding unnecessary logjams was, in\n                    fact, adopted at alowerlevelvias 17 of the Legal Profession (Amendment) Act 2001\n                    (Act 35 of 2001) which amended s 85 “to enable the Chairman of\n                    the Inquiry Panel to constitute one or moreReview\n                        Committees(comprising an advocate and solicitor and a legal\n                    officer) to review complaints or information against advocates and solicitors\n                    and to dismiss any complaint if the Review Committee is of the unanimous opinion\n                    that the complaint is frivolous, vexatious, misconceived or lacking in\n                    substance” [emphasis added] (see theExplanatory\n                        Statementto the Legal Profession (Amendment) Bill (Bill 39\n                    of 2001)). Indeed, the following observations by the Minister for Law,\n                    Prof S Jayakumar, during the second reading of this Bill, bear\n                    quotation (seeSingapore Parliamentary Debates, Official\n                        Report(5 October 2001) vol 83 at\n                    cols 2195–2196): Prior to 1986, the Council could only refer to the Chairman of the Inquiry\n                        Panel those complaints relating to the conduct of a lawyer in his\n                        professional capacity. The Council therefore weeded out those complaints\n                        which did not relate to a lawyer’s professional conduct. In 1986, the\n                        Act was amended to allow any complaints relating to any conduct of a lawyer,\n                        not just conduct in his professional capacity. This was because, sometimes,\n                        misconduct by a lawyer, even in his private capacity, may be sufficient to\n                        render him unfit to continue being a member of the honourable profession.\n                        The Council thereafter acted on the assumption that they should continue to\n                        play a sifting role in the post-1986 regime. However, the\n                            Court of Appeal ruled earlier this year that the Council should not be\n                            performing such a sifting function, but should simply forward all\n                            complaints to be dealt with by the Inquiry Committees. Sir, this is not practical and has resulted in some\n                            difficulties. The Law Society receives more than\n                        100 complaints a year. More than half of them are without substance and\n                        are sifted out by the Council, while the remainder goes to an Inquiry\n                        Committee for a full inquiry.If the Council is not to\n                            sift, the caseload on the Inquiry Committees will more than\n                            double. Each Inquiry Committee is made up of two lawyers of\n                        at least 12 years’ standing, a Legal Service Officer of at least\n                        10 years' experience as well as a lay person. Doubling the caseload of\n                        the Inquiry Committees will create a serious strain on scarce resources and\n                        slow down the disciplinary process. Therefore a new machinery known as the\n                        Review Committee will be set up to act as a sifting mechanism. [emphasis added] There is, in our view, no reason inprinciplewhy similar reasoning ought not to apply to the\n                    situation in the present proceedings (which relates to the\n                    “sifting” function of the Disciplinary Tribunal\n                instead). (3)   Conceptual and practical difficulties arising under the\n                statutory language in the then s 96 prior to the 1970 Amendment Act 29     As we have seen, the relevant provisionprior to the 1970 Amendment Actwas the\n                    former s 96(1) (reproduced above at[16]). The Disciplinary Committee (now known as the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal) was taskedthenwith determining that\n                        “due cause” did not exist for\n                    disciplinary action pursuant to what is now s 83orthat while no “sufficient\n                        cause” existed for such disciplinary action the advocate\n                    and solicitor concerned should be ordered to pay a penaltyorthat “due cause”\n                    for disciplinary action pursuant to what is now s 83did\n                        exist. In this last-mentioned of the three possible\n                    determinations that could have been arrived at by the Disciplinary Committee,\n                    the Disciplinary Committee would thenreferthe\n                    caseto the court of three Judgesforits decision. 30However, theprevious terminology(of “due cause”) in the then s 96 of the Act (the\n                    present s 93 (which, of course, contains quite different terminology))\n                    could – conceptually, if not practically – raise unnecessary\n                    question marksvis-à-visthe role and function of\n                    the Disciplinary Committee. If the determination of the Disciplinary Committee\n                    (now known as the Disciplinary Tribunal) was, indeed,a\n                        finding of “due cause”(pursuant to the terminology\n                    under the then s 96(1)(c) of the Act\n                    (reproduced above at[16])), thenthe Disciplinary Committee would have usurped the function of the\n                        court of three Judges as only the latter could makeadecisionas to whether or not there was\n                        “due cause” pursuant to the then\n                    s 87 of the Act (the present s 83 of the Act) and, on arriving at such\n                    a decision,administer the appropriate sanctionunder the then s 87(1) of the Act (the present s 83(1)). (4)   The conceptual and practical difficulties removed by the\n                1970 Amendment Act 31Put simply, a determination\n                        or finding of “due cause” as such was not – and is not\n                        – within the purview of the Disciplinary Tribunal. This is\n                    why, in our view, the amendment effected by the 1970 Amendment Act (see\n                    above at[17]) was necessary. It will be\n                    recalled that the 1970 Amendment Actsubstitutedthe phrase “due cause” wherever it\n                    appeared in the then s 96 of the Act (the present s 93 (as amended))with the phrase “cause of sufficient\n                        gravity”. In other words, the phrase “cause of sufficient gravity” was intended, in our\n                    view, to representa determination by the Disciplinary\n                        Committee (now known as the Disciplinary Tribunal) that there was\n                        aprima faciecase on the relevant evidence\n                        that “due cause” might be present and that, in the\n                        circumstances, the case ought to be referred to the court of\n                        three Judges. In other words, a finding that “cause\n                    of sufficient gravity” exists wasnotadetermination or finding of “due cause” as\n                        such; rather, the Disciplinary Tribunal (as the Disciplinary\n                    Committee is now known) would be performing a “filtering” or “sifting” functionin order to ensure\n                        that less serious (and, a fortiori,trivial or\n                        frivolous) casesarenotreferred\n                    to the court of three Judges. Indeed, such cases would fall, instead,\n                    within the ambit of s 93(1)(a)or(b) (reproduced above\n                    at[13]). 32     Thefirstprovision referred to at the end of the preceding paragraph,viz, s 93(1)(a), relates to a\n                    situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal has determined there isno (potential orprima facie) merit\n                        in the sense described above, and should therefore proceed no\n                        further. A clear example of such a case would be one where the\n                    conduct of the advocate and solicitor doesnot fall within\n                        anyof the limbs in s 83(2) to begin with. Indeed, we would\n                    think that this would,practically speaking, be\n                    themain (if not the only)situation because, if\n                    the conduct of the advocate and solicitor falls within one or more of the limbs\n                    in s 83(2), we should think that there should besome\n                        sanctionadministered to that advocate and solicitor. This is, as\n                    we shall see in the following paragraph, precisely what s 93(1)(b)envisages. 33     Following from the analysis in the preceding\n                    paragraph, thesecondprovision,viz, s 93(1)(b),\n                    relates to a situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal, whilst of the view\n                    that there isno (potential orprima\n                        facie) merit in the sense described above(ie, that “due cause” might be\n                    found by a court of three Judges), isneverthelessof the view thatsome (lesser)\n                        sanctionshould be administered against the advocate and\n                    solicitor concerned. One clear situation in which the Disciplinary Tribunal can\n                    administer such a (lesser) sanction relates to a situation where the conduct of\n                    the advocate and solicitor concerned is found to come within one or more of the\n                    limbs in s 83(2) (in our view, such conduct is more likely than not to fall\n                    within s 83(2)(h) (given its nature as a\n                    “catch-all provision” (seeLaw Society of\n                        Singapore v Ng Chee Sing[2000] 1 SLR(R) 466 at [40]\n                    andLaw Society of Singapore v Ahmad Khalis bin Abdul\n                        Ghani[2006] 4 SLR(R) 308 at [79])), as is, indeed, the\n                    case here) but falls short of aprima faciecase\n                    of “due cause” that ought to be referred to a court of\n                    three Judges for decision. Whether or not the Disciplinary Tribunal can\n                    administer a similar sanction in relation to a situation which does not come\n                    within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) was not an issue before us and\n                    we therefore do not make any pronouncement on it, although it would appear thatthe Council of the Law Societyhas the power\n                    to administer a sanction in such a situation pursuant to the power conferred\n                    upon it under s 88 of the Act where “no cause of sufficient gravity\n                    exists for a formal investigation” by a Disciplinary Tribunal (see Tan\n                    Yock Lin,The Law of Advocates and Solicitors in Singapore\n                        and West Malaysia(Butterworths Asia, 2nd Ed, 1998) at\n                    pp 778–779 (citingHilborne v Law Society of\n                        Singapore[1977–1978] SLR(R) 342)). 34     As we have already seen, however, there is yet\n                    athirdsituation (under s 93(1)(c)) in which the Disciplinary Tribunal determines that\n                    thereis (potential orprima facie) merit in the complaint and that the case should therefore be\n                        referred to the court of three Judges.",
        "A summary of our findings and views above": "35     A point already mentioned (above at[31]) is of such fundamental importance to these\n                    proceedings that it bears repeating:It is of the first\n                        importance to note that a finding by the Disciplinary Tribunal that the\n                        conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one or more of\n                        the limbs in s 83(2) does not, ipso facto, entail a finding of “due cause”. Put simply, a\n                    determination that the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one\n                    or more of the limbs in s 83(2) isa necessary –\n                        but not sufficient – condition for a finding of “due\n                        cause”. This interpretation is consistent with the use of\n                    the word “may” in s 83(2)\n                    itself. Whether or not thereis, in fact,\n                        “due cause” (meriting asanctionpursuant to s 83(1)) will (as\n                    already mentioned above) be determined bythe court of\n                        three Judges, having regard to all the facts and surrounding\n                        circumstances in the application before it – of which a threshold\n                        finding that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls\n                        within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) is necessary.\n                    Indeed, as we have also noted, the court of three Judges might even find\n                    – contrary to the finding of the Disciplinary Tribunal – that the\n                    facts of the application before it donoteven\n                    fall within one or more of the limbs in s 83(2) to begin with (in which\n                    case no action whatsoever will be taken against the advocate and solicitor\n                    concerned). If, however, the court of three Judges determines that\n                    “due cause”hasbeen shown, it canthen\n                        administer the appropriate sanction(pursuant to s 83(1) of\n                    the Act (reproduced above at[14])). 36     As already noted above (at[28]), the construction we have placed on\n                    ss 93 and 83 is also consistent with logic and commonsense inasmuch as the\n                    court of three Judges is not faced with a logjam of unnecessary cases of a\n                    trivial (and,a fortiori, frivolous) nature.\n                    Further, this construction is, as we have sought to demonstrate, wholly\n                    consistent with the legislative history as well as purpose of the provisions (in\n                    particular, that relating to the introduction of the phrase “cause of\n                    sufficient gravity” into the present s 93 by way of the\n                    1970 Amendment Act). At this juncture, we note that whilst the Article is,\n                    in the main, a reasoned and learned one from one of Singapore’s most\n                    promising young legal scholars, the particular proposition was based on a wrongpremiseinasmuch as the Article, in effect,equated (and conflated)“cause of\n                    sufficient gravity” with “due cause” (see also the Article\n                    at para 40, reproduced above at[8]). 37     As we have explained above, the phrase\n                    “cause of sufficient gravity” was deliberately as well as\n                    specifically introduced in order to clarify that the task ofthe Disciplinary Tribunalwas to act as a “filter” in order to determine whether or not\n                    there was a case of “sufficient gravity” thatcould, on a finding by the court of three Judges, be\n                    ascertained (basednot onlyon the case falling\n                    within one or more of the limbs of s 83(2)but\n                        alsoon thegravity and seriousness of the\n                        conduct based on the evidence) to constitute “due cause” that merited the requisitesanctionfrom a range of sanctions prescribed under\n                    s 83(1). If so, then the Disciplinary Tribunal wouldrefer the case accordingly to a court of three Judgespursuant to s 93(1)(c) of the Act. The\n                    aforementionedequation (and conflation)in the\n                    Article occurred because the learned authorequated the\n                        establishment of “due cause” with the establishment of the\n                        ingredients in one or more of the limbs under s 83(2) of the\n                        Act. That this is so is clear from para 45 of the Article\n                    reproduced above (at[8]).However, this is, with respect, erroneous because, as we have\n                    already explained, a finding that the advocate and solicitor’s conduct\n                    falls within one or more of the limbs of s 83(2) of the Act is, at most, athresholdrequirement to theultimatedetermination that “due cause”\n                    has beenestablished. In any event, a\n                    determination bythe Disciplinary Tribunalthat\n                    the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of the limbs\n                    of s 83(2) of the Act isby no means conclusive as the\n                        final decision lies with the court of three Judges. Indeed,\n                    the court of three Judges not only makes the final decision as to whether\n                    or not the advocate and solicitor’s conduct falls within one or more of\n                    the limbs of s 83(2),but also whether that conduct\n                        constitutes “due cause” for the purposes of the administering\n                        of a sanction pursuant to s 83(1) of the Act. 38     As we have also explained, if the Disciplinary\n                    Tribunal finds – at the other extreme – that the conduct of the\n                    advocate and solicitor concerned does not even fall within any of the limbs in\n                    s 83(2) to begin with, then it wouldnottakeany further action whatsoever(see\n                        s 93(1)(a) of the Act as well as above at[32]). 39     In the final situation (which seems to us to\n                    be an “intermediate” one), the\n                    Disciplinary Tribunal may find that the conduct of the advocate and solicitor\n                    concerneddoesfall within one or more of the\n                    limbs of s 83(2) (which is more likely than not, as pointed out above at[33], to fall within\n                        s 83(2)(h))butfeels that the conduct itself, whilsttechnicallywithin the ambit of one or more of these limbs, is\n                    neverthelessnotone of “sufficient\n                    gravity” to merit a reference to the court of three Judges. In other\n                    words, the Disciplinary Tribunal is of the view that there is – on the\n                    facts and circumstances before it –no prima faciecase that would result in a finding\n                    of “due cause” by the court of\n                    three Judges, bearing in mind (as explained above) a finding of\n                        “due cause” isnot,ipso facto,\n                    demonstratedmerelyby a finding that the conduct\n                    of the advocate and solicitor concerned falls within one or more of the limbs of\n                    s 83(2). In this (final) situation, the Disciplinary Tribunal can\n                    administer a much less serious sanction pursuant to s 93(1)(b) of the Act (see also above at[33]).",
        "Conclusion and practical considerations": "40     The conclusion which we have arrived at\n                    – to the effect that the Disciplinary Tribunaldoespossess the discretion torefrainfrom referring matters to the court of three Judges\n                    even if all the ingredients of a disciplinary charge had been made out –\n                    is not only consistent with the language as well as legislative history and\n                    purpose of the relevant provisions but is also consistent withpracticalconsiderations as well. We have already noted\n                    the practical benefits which result from the “sifting” function\n                    exercised in this manner by the Disciplinary Tribunal. We also note –\n                    parenthetically – that acontraryapproach\n                    (which would result inautomaticreference of\n                    cases to the court of three Judges) would act as a disincentive to the\n                    advocate and solicitor concerned to admit his or her guilt before the\n                    Disciplinary Tribunal (even for relatively trivial charges). This would, in\n                    turn, result in a greater number offullhearings\n                    before Disciplinary Tribunals, thereby increasing the average time taken to\n                    dispose of complaints. Such a result would necessarily run counter to the\n                    legislative spirit of the Act itself, which (at s 93(3) of the Act)\n                    specifically tasks a Disciplinary Tribunal to “carry out its work\n                    expeditiously”. It turns out that the prevalent practice of Disciplinary\n                    Tribunals – which adopts, in fact, the approach which we have endorsed\n                    – was correct all along.",
        "Conclusion": "41     For the reasons set out above, we dismissed\n                    the Law Society’s application and made no order as to costs. We also\n                    remitted the matter to the same Disciplinary Tribunal for it to decide on the\n                    appropriate form of punishment for the Respondent."
