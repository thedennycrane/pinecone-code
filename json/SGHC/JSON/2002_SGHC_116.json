        "The facts": "1. Flairis Technology Corporation Limited (the first plaintiffs) are a\n\npublic company listed on the secondary board of the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SGX);\n\nthey were previously known as Allied Components International Limited. The main business\n\nof the first plaintiffs is the manufacture of printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA),\n\nproduct design and plastic moulds for audio telecommunication multi-media products and\n\nengineering plastic parts. Flairis Advanced Manufacturing Pte Ltd (the second plaintiffs)\n\nare a wholly owned subsidiary of the first plaintiffs and were incorporated on 22 December\n\n1999; the company was formerly known as Allied Advanced Manufacturing Pte Ltd and changed\n\nto its present name on 26 March 2001.2. Gan Huan Kee (the first defendant) was appointed the\n\nmanaging-director of the second plaintiffs in January 2000; he tendered his resignation on\n\n4 May 2001 and left the services of the second plaintiffs on 28 May 2001. Chan Tien Seng\n\n(the second defendant) was the Vice-President (Operations) of the second plaintiffs until\n\nhe tendered his resignation on 20 April 2001 and left on 4 May 2001. Khong Soo Har (the\n\nthird defendant) joined the second plaintiffs as the Vice-President (Logistics) on 17\n\nJanuary 2000 from which position he resigned on 23 April 2001 and left, on 4 May 2001.\n\nWong Kwok Ping (the fourth defendant) joined the second plaintiffs on 17 January 2000 as\n\nthe Director of Design Engineering, from which position he resigned on 25 April 2001.3. Prior to their employment by the second plaintiffs, the first,\n\nsecond and third defendants were parties to a joint-venture agreement with the first\n\nplaintiffs dated 9 December 1999 (the JVA), which the first plaintiffs said was based on a\n\nbusiness plan initiated by the first defendant. Under the JVA, the parties agreed inter\n\nalia, to research and develop PCBA and products based thereon, for a subsidiary to be\n\nestablished by the first plaintiffs (namely the second plaintiffs). The terms of the JVA\n\nstated that the three (3) defendants would provide technical expertise for the business\n\nactivities of the second plaintiffs which in essence was, to set up and operate a\n\nmanufacturing facility in Singapore for PCBA with Advanced Surface Mount Technology. In\n\nturn, the first plaintiffs would provide the necessary funding of about $12m for the\n\nacquisition of special manufacturing facilities and skilled personnel for the second\n\nplaintiffs. As at 31 May 2001, the first plaintiffs claimed they provided funding in\n\nexcess of $15m to the second plaintiffs, excluding banking facilities of another $15m or\n\nthereabouts. The first plaintiffs also hired employees for the second plaintiffs which\n\nnumbered 239 as at 29 May 2001.4. Besides setting out the obligations of each party to the agreement,\n\nthe JVA also included (under cl 4.3) a management team share performance scheme whereby\n\ncertain number of shares in the second plaintiffs would be issued to the first, second and\n\nthird defendants, based on a formula pegged to performance targets/profitability of the\n\nsecond plaintiffs. It was envisaged that the second plaintiffs would ultimately be listed\n\non SGX.5. The second plaintiffs also established a design centre for purposes\n\nof designing the sequence, layout and the type of components to be mounted on printed\n\ncircuit boards.6. The first to third defendants entered into service contracts with\n\nthe second plaintiffs, all dated 29 December 1999; effectively they were the senior\n\nmanagement of the second plaintiffs. The fourth defendant's employment contract with the\n\nsecond plaintiffs came later (dated 16 February 2001); he was one of the initial employees\n\n(about 22) hired by the first, second and third defendants and was specifically tasked\n\nwith developing the designs for the PCBA (and products to be developed by the second\n\nplaintiffs) as well as to manage and supervise the personnel employed in the design\n\ncentre.7. The second plaintiffs commenced operations in the first quarter of\n\n2000. According to the first plaintiffs, as at May 2001, the second plaintiffs had\n\ndesigned and manufactured various products for a number of reputable (local and foreign)\n\ncustomers which included Hewlett-Packard, Ericsson, Philips Electronics Singapore Pte Ltd\n\n(Philips), Serial System Ltd (Serial System), Eagle Wireless, Plexus etc; the second\n\nplaintiffs also manufactured products designed by their own customers.8. In January 2001, the Finance Manager (Keith Ong) of the second\n\nplaintiffs left the company and his position was temporarily taken over by Mark Tan, who\n\nwas seconded from the first plaintiffs. After reviewing the accounts of the second\n\nplaintiffs, Mark Tan reported to the Chief Financial Officer (Tan Zing Yuen) of the first\n\nplaintiffs that certain items were not accounted for. As a result, Tan Zing Yuen assigned\n\nthe first plaintiffs' then financial controller Shieh Ping to conduct an internal audit of\n\nthe accounts of the second plaintiffs, which was completed on 2 March 2001. Shieh Ping\n\nfound that the profits of the second plaintiffs for the period July 2000 to January 2001\n\nwere overstated (by $1.5m) due to the omission of certain purchases and expenses and, the\n\nrecognition as sales of the advanced billings made to certain customers of the second\n\nplaintiffs even before the products were delivered to the customers; the net effect was\n\nthat there should be a loss of $2.9m instead of a profit of $235,000.9. The first plaintiffs decided to appoint an international accounting\n\nfirm (KPMG) to verify the findings of the internal audit. KPMG were appointed and their\n\nreport dated 11 September 2001 showed that for the period July-December 2000, there was a\n\nloss of $4.423m instead of a profit of $545,000. The accounts (and the inaccuracies) of\n\nthe second plaintiffs had an impact on the first plaintiffs as the same were included in\n\nthe consolidated accounts of the first plaintiffs reported to the SGX.10. In the last quarter of 2000, the first, second and third defendants\n\ninformed the first plaintiffs that the second plaintiffs could not be publicly listed\n\nbecause of rules imposed by SGX against chain listings. Consequently, in January 2001, the\n\nfirst, second and third defendants commenced negotiations with the first plaintiffs on the\n\nshares entitlement under cl 4.3 of the JVA, pointing out that shares allotted to them in\n\nthe second plaintiffs would be illiquid. It was agreed between the parties that instead of\n\nshares in the second plaintiffs, the three (3) defendants would be given share options in\n\nthe first plaintiffs; as a result, the first defendant received options for 1.43 million\n\nshares while the second and third defendants received options for 1.19 million shares\n\neach. It was also agreed that the JVA should be terminated as well as the service\n\ncontracts of all defendants; however, the management team and business of the second\n\nplaintiffs would remain unchanged. The terms reached between the parties were evidenced in\n\na Memorandum of Understanding and Joint Venture Termination Agreement both dated 9\n\nFebruary 2001 and SGX was duly notified the same day. In consequence, the first, second\n\nand third defendants entered into fresh agreements with the second plaintiffs all dated 13\n\nFebruary 2001.11. The plaintiffs alleged that it was around this time that the first,\n\nsecond and third defendants offered their services to a competitor of the second\n\nplaintiffs namely, Tri-M Technologies (Singapore) Limited (Tri-M), a public company listed\n\non the main board of SGX. According to the plaintiffs, the three (3) defendants approached\n\nTri-M with a business plan dated 12 March 2001 (the business plan) wherein they offered:\n\ntheir design services for products similar to those they had designed for the second\n\nplaintiffs, existing employees and customer base of the second plaintiffs and, they\n\nadvised Tri-M there was a ‘window’ for the period April to June 2001 for\n\nbusiness opportunities. The first plaintiffs alleged that the first three (3) defendants\n\nused confidential information belonging to the second plaintiffs to prepare the business\n\nplan whilst still in the latter's employment.12. When the second, third and fourth defendants tendered their\n\nresignations on 20th, 23rdand 25thApril 2001\n\nrespectively, the plaintiffs attempted to persuade the first defendant to stay on by\n\noffering him (on 27 April 2001) an incentive of an additional 1.43m share options in the\n\nfirst plaintiffs; the first defendant declined. Coincidentally, many of the employees (39)\n\nrecruited by the defendants resigned at the same time.13. A day after the first defendant's departure (28 May 2001), the\n\nplaintiffs decided to check his computer system. They discovered a copy of the business\n\nplan and, that information, electronic mails and documents (for the period February to 28\n\nMay 2001) had been removed by the first defendant. Similarly, when they checked the\n\ncomputer of the third defendant, the plaintiffs found a copy of the business plan whilst\n\nan examination of the second defendant's computer revealed that he had removed therefrom\n\nall data/information relating to his work.14. Subsequently, through an announcement made by Tri-M to SGX, the\n\nplaintiffs discovered that the first, second, third (and later) the fourth defendants had\n\nall joined Tri-M together with a number of their former employees.",
        "The claim": "15. On 11 June 2001, the plaintiffs commenced this action claiming\n\ndamages for breach of the JVA (as well as for conspiracy) and, an injunction to restrain\n\nthe defendants inter alia from:a. taking up employment with Tri-M;b. soliciting, interfering with or enticing away from the second\n\n  plaintiffs any person who was or had been, a client, customer or employee;c. carrying on or being engaged in business similar to or in\n\n  competition with that undertaken by the second plaintiffs, either alone or jointly with\n\n  others, directly or indirectly;d. acting as a director or otherwise of any person, firm or company\n\n  engaging directly or indirectly in any business which was in competition with the business\n\n  undertaken by the second plaintiffs;e. using confidential information of the plaintiffs or any part thereof\n\n  otherwise than for the purpose for which it was supplied.There was also a claim against the first and second defendants for\n\ndamages for breach of directors' duties owed to the second plaintiffs.16. Based on the above endorsement of claim, the plaintiffs obtained\n\n(ex-parte) on 12 June 2001, an interim injunction in terms similar to para 15 (b), (c),\n\n(d) and (e). The defendants were also restrained from dealing with potential customers in\n\na list they had provided to the court and, from revealing trade secrets also in a list\n\nprovided to the court. However, on the defendants' application, the injunction was set\n\naside with costs on 5 July 2001 by Judicial Commissioner Tay Yong Kwang. On 7 August 2001,\n\nJC Tay varied the earlier order of court and granted:a. an injunction restraining the first defendant from\n\n  soliciting/enticing away the second plaintiffs' employees, limited to one year from 28 May\n\n  2001;b. an injunction restraining all four (4) defendants from using the\n\n  second plaintiffs' schematic designs, Gerber files and bills of materials set out in a\n\n  list provided by the plaintiffs, excluding those wholly supplied by the defendants'\n\n  customers and or the defendants' customers' agents.17. The plaintiffs filed a (lengthy) statement of claim detailing the\n\ndefendants' breach of their fiduciary duties and contracts of employment. The plaintiffs\n\npleaded that the third defendant attempted (on or about 4 May 2001) to copy/remove data\n\nbelonging to the second plaintiffs from the office computer system he used.18. The plaintiffs alleged that the accounts rendered by the first,\n\nsecond and third defendants for the period July to December 2000 misrepresented the\n\nfinancial state of the second plaintiffs. They particularised one instance as advanced\n\nbilling of customers like Ericsson and Advent Electronics Pte Ltd (Advent) before actual\n\ncompletion and delivery of goods by the second plaintiffs.19. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants sought to\n\ndivert existing contracts and projects undertaken by the second plaintiffs for their own\n\nbenefit and or for the benefit of the defendants' prospective employer. By a consent order\n\nmade in December 2001, the plaintiffs deleted this allegation from their statement of\n\nclaim together with their claim for damages based on conspiracy.20. In the common defence which they filed, the defendants denied they\n\nprepared the accounts -- they averred that the financial manager of the second plaintiffs\n\n(who reported to the chief financial officer of the first plaintiffs) was responsible for\n\nmanaging the working capital, the cash flow requirements as well as the preparation and\n\nmaintenance of the second plaintiffs' accounts.21. While admitting the second and third defendants had prepared the\n\nbusiness plan which referred to some of the existing customers of the second plaintiffs,\n\nthe defendants averred that information relating to the then existing customer base of the\n\nsecond plaintiffs was readily available to the public.22. The first, second and third defendants denied they had attempted to\n\ncopy/remove data belonging to the second plaintiffs; they had only deleted certain\n\npersonal e-mails as part of the handing-over process before they left the second\n\nplaintiffs' services. The third defendant pleaded that the second plaintiffs'\n\nrepresentative Chau Tar Wee also deleted the third defendant's e-mails on 4 May 2001\n\n(apart from those deleted personally by the third defendant himself).23. The defendants denied that advanced billing of Advent and Ericsson\n\nwas against the practice of the second plaintiffs. In any case, Advent was billed in\n\nDecember 2000 and in January 2001 pursuant to their request while Ericsson was invoiced in\n\nJanuary 2001 for work already completed at that point in time. The defendants denied that\n\ninformation relating to the second plaintiffs' products, schematic designs and Gerber\n\nfiles constituted trade secrets.24. Finally, the defendants denied they owed a duty to the second\n\nplaintiffs not to use or disclose confidential information not amounting to trade secrets,\n\nfollowing the termination of their employment.25. I shall not refer to the Reply filed by the plaintiffs as\n\nessentially, it reiterated the allegations pleaded in the statement of claim and joined\n\nissue with the defendants' pleadings.",
        "The evidence": "(i) the plaintiffs' case26. The plaintiffs called (6) witnesses for their case, including a\n\nformer employee (Lau Chor Boon) who was subpoenaed due to his reluctance to attend court.\n\nThe written testimony of the first plaintiffs' director (of special projects) Chiam Kia\n\nTiam (Chiam) has been set out in paras 1 to 14 above.27. In his cross-examination, Chiam (PW1) revealed he joined the first\n\nplaintiffs' employment on 1 September 2001, well after the four defendants had resigned\n\nand left the second plaintiffs' employment. Consequently, Chiam had no personal knowledge\n\n(which he confirmed) of events which took place in the two (2) companies at the material\n\ntime, including the negotiations leading to and, the JVA. Chiam did not meet any of the\n\ndefendants until their appearance at this trial. Chiam testified that he was hired as a\n\nconsultant by the first plaintiffs to advise them on restructuring as well as on the\n\nerrors discovered in the accounts of the second plaintiffs. He had been the audit manager\n\nat the accounting firm which was in charge of the first plaintiffs' initial public\n\noffering. During that time he was very involved with the first plaintiffs as the company\n\nhad to provide two years' forecasts to SGX and, he was aware of the setting up of the\n\nsecond plaintiffs.28. In his affidavit of evidence, Chiam had, in relation to the\n\ninaccurate accounts of the second plaintiffs deposed as follows (at para 35):the discovery of such large inaccuracies in accounts of [the second\n\n  plaintiffs] for the period 1 July 2000 to 31 December 2000 had a very drastic impact on\n\n  [the fist plaintiffs]. The accounts submitted by Gan [the first defendant] for the same\n\n  period were consolidated into the group accounts for the purpose of its half year\n\n  financial statement announcement to the Stock Exchange of Singapore Ltd on 8 February\n\n  2001. Apart from the obvious and immediate loss of reputation and credibility suffered by\n\n  the [the first plaintiffs] group, such results may have also caused loss to the general\n\n  investors in the share market and other indirect losses to [the first plaintiffs]…..I shall revert to the above passage later in my findings.29. Another representative from the first plaintiffs who testified was\n\nTan Zing Yuen (Zing), who has since left the first plaintiffs' employment (on 17 September\n\n2001) after having joined them in May 2000. In his affidavit, Zing (PW4) deposed that his\n\nduties as Chief Financial Officer included, overseeing the preparation of the group's\n\nconsolidated budget for the first plaintiffs and its subsidiaries and, funding for its\n\noperations. He said the preparation of the accounts of the subsidiaries, including the\n\nsecond plaintiffs', was the responsibility of the managing-director of each subsidiary and\n\nthe person's finance team. Zing also relied on cl 4.1(c) of the JVA to say that\n\nresponsibility for the second plaintiffs' accounts rest with the first, second and third\n\ndefendants. The relevant extracts of that clause states:Role of the Management TeamThe Management Team acknowledges and undertakes that it shall have\n\n  the principal responsibility for prompting the business of the company as well as the\n\n  smooth and efficient administration and operations thereof, subject to the overriding\n\n  supervision of [the first plaintiffs]. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,\n\n  the Management Team shall as a joint and several liability undertake the following\n\n  responsibilities:c. (ii) prepare and provide to [the first plaintiffs] on a monthly\n\n  basis management reports and accounts of the affairs of the [second plaintiffs].30. Although he acknowledged that the second plaintiffs' accounts were\n\nindeed prepared by the Finance Manager Keith Ong, Zing maintained that overall\n\nresponsibility lay with the first three (3) defendants as Keith Ong would have to submit\n\nsuch accounts to them for approval. On advanced invoicing, Zing deposed that the first\n\nplaintiffs' chief executive officer KY Wong (the CEO) had expressed concern at a weekly\n\nmanagement meeting of the first plaintiffs held on 26 March 2001, which the first\n\ndefendant attended. He said that although the CEO sought clarification from the first\n\ndefendant (who presented the accounts of the second plaintiffs at such meetings), the\n\nlatter did not explain. The subject was raised at subsequent management meetings\n\n(including one held on 9 April 2001 at which the first defendant was absent) but was never\n\naddressed by the first defendant, even until his resignation.31. Cross-examined, Zing;(i) testified he had interviewed Keith Ong for the post of Finance\n\n  Manager in or about May 2000 first, before a second interview was conducted by the first\n\n  defendant; at the time he had noted that Keith Ong had about 13 years' relevant experience\n\n  in addition to a degree in business studies (with accounting major) from Middlesex\n\n  University;(ii) disagreed it was Keith Ong's sole responsibility to carry out\n\n  book-keeping and accounting functions for the second plaintiffs, he considered the duties\n\n  a joint responsibility of all the senior management staff of the company, in particular of\n\n  the first and second defendants, as they were in charge of the day-to-day operations\n\n  (notwithstanding they had no accounting qualifications);(iii) testified there were two (2) signatories for the second\n\n  plaintiffs' cheques; for amounts of $5,000 and below, any two (2) members of the board of\n\n  directors could sign but, for amounts above $5,000, one signatory could be either the\n\n  first or second defendant whilst the other signatory must come from the first plaintiffs\n\n  (including himself). The practice applied to all subsidiaries of the first plaintiffs and\n\n  not only to the second plaintiffs;(iv) confirmed that the first plaintiffs (and he) would receive copies\n\n  (on a monthly basis) of accounting reports from the second plaintiffs, including profit\n\n  & loss accounts/forecasts and balance sheets, prepared by Keith Ong. If not for the\n\n  accounting error of $545,000, the second plaintiffs' accounts would have shown an\n\n  operating loss for the second half of 2000 not a profit. Although they picked up the\n\n  accounting error, the plaintiffs overlooked the discrepancy of $3.75m for material\n\n  purchases until the internal audit was carried out;(v) confirmed that the first plaintiffs' announcement to the SGX (on 8\n\n  February 2001) of the company's half year financial statement for the period ended 31\n\n  December 2000 (3AB141-148) clearly stated that the figures had not yet been audited.(vi) admitted that the plaintiffs wanted to introduce a computerised\n\n  materials management system to link up with their accounting system and, it was\n\n  implemented with the installation of the AXAPTA system in August 2000. However, he\n\n  disagreed that an earlier implementation of the AXAPTA system would have avoided the\n\n  accounting errors experienced by the second plaintiffs;(vii) said although he was unaware of the reasons why Advent wanted\n\n  advanced billing, the request was in any event not agreeable to the first plaintiffs.(viii) he agreed that based on the second plaintiffs' sales figure of\n\n  $19,760,000 for the first half of 2001, a profit of $545,000 or 2.75% was within the\n\n  industry's norm.32. One witness called by the plaintiffs was the accountant from KPMG\n\nwho had verified the factual accuracy and description of the accounting errors found by\n\nthe plaintiffs in their internal audit. KPMG's partner Phuoc Tran (Tran) confirmed in his\n\nreport dated 11 September 2001 that sales to customers (including Advent) were overstated\n\nby $3,329,000 whilst costs were understated by $1,639,000; the net result was a loss\n\nbefore tax of $4,423,000 instead of a profit of $545,000.33. Cross-examined, Tran (PW5) clarified that the procedures he\n\nconducted to arrive at his report were less than those prescribed for a proper audit as,\n\nhe did not look at all, but only selective accounting records; these included documents\n\ncompiled by the plaintiffs' management as well as suppliers' documents. I should emphasise\n\nhowever, that Tran was given full access to the records of the second plaintiffs.34. Another witness was Yap Choon Ming (Yap) the second plaintiffs'\n\ndirector of the design centre. As Yap's employment with the second plaintiffs commenced on\n\n19 May 2001, he was in the same position as Chiam – he had no personal knowledge of\n\nwhat transpired in the first or second plaintiffs during the tenure of the defendants'\n\nemployment. Yap's testimony centred on what was purportedly told to him by Lau Chor Boon\n\n(Lau) the plaintiffs' reluctant witness. In his written testimony, Yap (PW2) deposed that\n\nhe had met Lau in early December 2001 and, was handed documents which Lau had taken from\n\nTri-M's office as well as other documents which Yap subsequently ascertained came from the\n\nsecond plaintiffs.35. Lau (PW6) was specifically subpoenaed by the plaintiffs to testify\n\non the documents he had handed to Yap. Lau had been in the second plaintiffs' employment\n\nas an assistant design engineer from 2 January 2001 until he left on 16 June 2001. His\n\nuncle Teo Kang Wee (the second plaintiffs' design mechanical engineer) was instrumental in\n\nhis obtaining a job with the second plaintiffs. Lau was later employed by Tri-M (between\n\n20 June and 28 November 2001) in the same capacity. He testified he left the second\n\nplaintiffs' services together with about 30 other employees (including his uncle) who left\n\n(at the behest of the first defendant) in batches. These ex-employees subsequently joined\n\nTri-M and were his colleagues at Tri-M's design centre.36. Lau had visited the premises of Tri-M even before he left the\n\nsecond plaintiffs' employment. On or about 16 May 2001, he accompanied his uncle and the\n\nsecond plaintiffs' project manager (Wong Shu Fen) to Tri-M's office. He met the fourth\n\ndefendant at Tri-M's warehouse where measurements were taken for the layout of a design\n\ncentre, on the instructions of his uncle. He had also met the second defendant at Tri-M's\n\npremises in April 2001. Lau incorrectly identified the first defendant in court, mistaking\n\nthe third for the first, defendant.37. Lau confirmed the documents he had handed to Yap came from Tri-M's\n\noffice. They consisted of quotations from the second plaintiffs, one (1) of which he had\n\ninadvertently seen on the computer screen of Wong Shu Fen. While he was with Tri-M, the\n\nfourth defendant (who was in charge of the design centre) had instructed Lau (sometime in\n\nJune 2001) to delete information from the computer system relating to files of the second\n\nplaintiffs. He understood from the fourth defendant that it was after the second\n\nplaintiffs had lost their case against the defendants. Lau explained that he was unwilling\n\nto testify (although he had initially indicated he would affirm an affidavit of evidence\n\nfor the plaintiffs) because the fourth defendant had threatened him in December 2001 over\n\na forged medical certificate which Lau had tendered to Tri-M during his employment with\n\nthe company. I should point out that this allegation was denied when the fourth defendant\n\ntestified, along with Lau's allegation that the fourth defendant had instructed him to\n\ndelete the second plaintiffs' files in Tri-M's possession. The fourth defendant added that\n\nhe would not have given Lau a job at all on merit. It was Lau's uncle Teo Kang Wee who\n\napproached Tri-M's human resources department for a position for his nephew.38. Cross-examined, Lau admitted he had confessed to the fourth\n\ndefendant while with Tri-M, that he had used a false medical certificate and was asked to\n\nresign. Until told by counsel, Lau was unaware that Tri-M had lodged a police report on 20\n\nDecember 2001 relating to what he told the fourth defendant. Lau also agreed that he would\n\nnot know whether the first defendant did or did not entice other employees of the second\n\nplaintiffs to join Tri-M. Indeed, he agreed he was in no position to say whether any of\n\nthe defendants approached any employee of the second plaintiffs to leave and join Tri-M's\n\nservices; he confirmed none of them approached him.39. A witness called by the plaintiffs was Ong Siew Ching (Ong), the\n\nfirst plaintiffs' information technology manager. She (PW3) testified that on 4 May 2001,\n\ntogether with her colleague Chau Tar Wee (Chau), she had visited the premises of the\n\nsecond plaintiffs to conduct an inventory of the office computers. She and Chau split the\n\nwork and went their separate ways. At one stage, she was requested to find Chau by the\n\npersonal assistant (Ms Yong) to the first plaintiffs' chairman. When she located him, Chau\n\nwas at the third defendant's computer system and when questioned, Chau told her he was\n\ncopying all the third defendant's files onto diskettes as per the latter's request. Ong\n\ninformed Ms Yong who said the files were the company's data and should not be copied. Ong\n\nthen told Chau to stop copying the files, which he did. Chau indicated he had already\n\ncompleted copying and had passed the diskettes to the third defendant. Told by Chau that\n\nhe could not take out the diskettes from the company, the third defendant bent the\n\ndiskettes, handed them to Chau and left the premises; the plaintiffs did not call Chau to\n\ntestify nor explain his absence as a witness.",
        "(ii) the defendants' case": "(a) the expert testimony40. In addition to the four (4) defendants, there were two (2) experts\n\ncalled by them as witnesses, one was Lee Chin Tat and the other Leslie Lee Teck Hai. It\n\nwould be more expedient for me to deal with the expert testimony first before I review the\n\nevidence of the defendants.41. Lee Chin Tat Roger (Roger) is the sole-proprietor of Innotech\n\nElectronics, which inter alia, markets electronic components (manufactured in Asia) to\n\nforeign electronics companies including subcontractors and manufacturers. He was requested\n\nby the defendants to render his opinion on whether the second plaintiffs would have any\n\nconfidential information or trade secrets in respect of the designs of printed circuit\n\nboards (PCB) which they carried out for their customers. Lee (DW5) answered the question\n\nin the negative, for the following reasons:(i) as an electronics contract manufacturer, the second plaintiffs have\n\n  no proprietary rights of their own but provide design, manufacturing and other services to\n\n  their customers who would include original equipment manufacturers (OEM) and others;(ii) in respect of design services carried out by contract\n\n  manufacturers, the intellectual property rights of a particular design and product would\n\n  belong to the customer. At the conclusion of an assignment, all documents are returned to\n\n  the customer;(iii) design services are offered by all major electronics contract\n\n  manufacturers;(iv) the designing process involves making use of computer-aided design\n\n  to generate the Gerber files and the Bills of Materials. The Bills of Materials are later\n\n  passed onto the purchasing department to obtain the cost of individual components listed,\n\n  the prices of which are easily available in the open market;(v) once a product is launched in the market, it would be possible for\n\n  any competitor to reverse engineer and copy the product's functionality.I would add that Roger is a remarkable person as he secured almost all\n\nof his (professional) qualifications by part-time studies/correspondence courses including\n\nhis master's degree (in business administration) from the University of Strathclyde. Of\n\nthe four (4) defendants, he is only acquainted with the first through their contact at the\n\nSingapore Institute of Materials Management (the Institute) of which Roger is the\n\nprofessional development director. Apparently, Roger did a case study on Tri-M last year\n\n(for his co-authorship of a book on world class logistics published by the Institute) on\n\nwhat made a successful contract manufacturer; case studies were also done on companies\n\nsuch as Dell and those in the Singapore Technologies group. Roger's experiences\n\n(approximating 20 years) included working for American multinationals such as Fairchild\n\nand Singapore's (most well-known contract manufacturer) Venture Manufacturing (S) Ltd;\n\nindeed, he was part of the team which co-founded Venture Manufacturing (S) Ltd.42. The defendants' other expert witness Leslie Lee Teck Hai (Leslie)\n\nis a director and technical consultant of Meds Technologies Pte Ltd. His twelve years'\n\nworking experience included a stint (one year) with Motorola and four (4) years with a\n\nlocal company, as a PCB design engineer. He testified he had worked as a PCB designer for\n\ncompanies such as Hewlett-Packard, Intel and Agilent. Leslie was approached by the fourth\n\ndefendant to be a witness; they knew each other from business dealings whilst employed by\n\ndifferent companies previously. He does not know the other defendants at all. He worked in\n\nMotorola when Yap (PW2) was also employed by the multinational; the latter was senior to\n\nhim. Leslie (DW6) confirmed Roger's opinion that information leading to and, the design of\n\nPCB itself belongs a customer; he said:(i) in addition to the second plaintiffs, other public companies which\n\n  are contract manufacturers are Natsteel Electronics Ltd, Omni Industries Ltd and Venture\n\n  Manufacturing (S) Ltd;(ii) a customer is free to go to any contract manufacturer to design\n\n  his product. Due to the nature of the designer's job, he may often be engaged to design\n\n  printed circuit boards (PCB) for different customers who are competitors in the market.\n\n  Recognising this fact, customers are very careful in protecting their intellectual\n\n  property rights in the design specifications and in the final product. The customer would\n\n  therefore release to the designer only sufficient information for the designing of a\n\n  particular PCB;(iii) the design process involves obtaining the customer's\n\n  specifications and then producing a schematic design (using computer-aided designs\n\n  software tools [CAD]) that includes the outline drawing of all components that are mounted\n\n  on the PCB. The designer would need to be familiar with the components that he is working\n\n  with. Various types of CAD software are easily available in the market. Such design\n\n  assignments are usually customised and one-off tailored for a specific product and model.\n\n  It cannot be reused for a different model of the same product; designs for older models\n\n  would in most cases also be obsolete, due to rapid advancement in technology in the\n\n  industry itself;(iv) consequently, the second plaintiffs' Gerber files, Bill of\n\n  Materials and schematic designs would not constitute trade secrets or confidential\n\n  information, which, in any event belong to the customer.43. The plaintiffs had pegged their case (on the defendants' breach of\n\nconfidential information) on the second plaintiffs' non-disclosure agreements (NDA) with\n\ntheir customers (see 1AB104-110) which included one with Serial System Ltd (another listed\n\ncompany, see 1AB667). The second plaintiffs even had a mutual NDA with one of their\n\ncustomers Union-Tech Limited (see 1AB106-108). According to Roger and Leslie, NDAs are a\n\ncommon practice in the contract manufacturing industry although mutual NDAs are rare. Even\n\nin the latter case, confidential information belongsnotto the designer but to the\n\ncustomer. Indeed, the agreement with Serial System Ltd (dated 3 July 2000) stipulated [in\n\ncl 9.1]) that all copyright and intellectual property rights in respect of the\n\ndeliverables (defined to mean prototypes and other items set out in annex D to the\n\nagreement) shall belong solely and entirely to the former.44. Roger said it made no sense for a contract manufacturer to own the\n\ndesign of a product produced for a client. It would deter customers from going to such\n\ncontract manufacturers as multinationals do not just rely on one but, a number of contract\n\nmanufacturers, to produce/design their PCBs.45. Before I consider the testimony of the four (4) defendants, some\n\nmention should be made of the process known as reverse engineering, on which Roger (and\n\nthe fourth defendant) was cross-examined at some length. Roger testified that reverse\n\nengineering can produce a product similar (in terms of characteristics) but not identical\n\nto, the original. However, the reverse engineering process may result in a product which\n\ncould be better than the original and he cited as one example the floppy diskette —\n\nalthough it was designed by the United States of America, Japan had developed a better\n\ndesign. Watches were an another example where the Japanese had improved on the original\n\ndesign (presumably) of the Swiss. Generic products (such as local area networks) are easy\n\nto reverse engineer but perhaps not items like Intel's chips or CPUs (central processing\n\nunits). He estimated that it would take 2-2 weeks to reverse engineer a PCB.46. In so far as pricing was concerned, Roger opined that it was not\n\ndifficult for a contract manufacturer to obtain prices of components comprise in a Bill of\n\nMaterials. The more sophisticated a product, the greater the number of components – a\n\nmonitor could have as many as 300 components. As a contract manufacturer must, (in order\n\nto remain competitive) be able to quote a price to a customer soon after (within 24 hours)\n\nbeing approached by a potential customer, Roger said it cannot be a time-consuming process\n\nas counsel for the plaintiffs suggested. From practice, contract manufacturers would know\n\nwhich suppliers to approach to obtain prices of components. The suppliers' names are also\n\nreadily available from catalogues and increasingly so, from the internet. Moreover, the\n\ncustomer would furnish a list of the required components to the contract manufacturer and,\n\nit would identify the suppliers concerned.47. Cross-examination of Leslie revealed that last year, he had\n\nsupplied a particular software (of which he was then the exclusive distributor) to Tri-M\n\nbut it was a one-off transaction.",
        "(b) the defendants' testimony": "48.    Prior to joining the second plaintiffs’ employment, the\n\nfirst defendant had had 24 years’ experience in the electronics industry. He had also\n\nworked as a test engineering manager at SCI Manufacturing Singapore Pte Ltd (SCI) for\n\nabout six (6) years; SCI's business is similar to the second plaintiffs’ in that it\n\ndesigns and manufactures electronic products for original equipment manufacturers (OEM)\n\nwhich included Eagle Wireless, Hewlett-Packard and Philips. As the managing director of\n\nthe second plaintiffs, the first defendant said his duties and responsibilities were\n\npurely managerial in nature; he was never involved in product designing processes, unlike\n\nthe fourth defendant.49. The first defendant pointed out that even before the JVA, the first\n\nplaintiffs already had three (3) factories (within its group) in Malaysia which\n\nmanufactured PCBA, using Advanced Surface Mount Technology (SMT) and machinery which were\n\ncomparable to those used by the second plaintiffs. When the second plaintiffs commenced\n\noperations in mid-January 2001, it was with two (2) SMT lines to which four (4) more were\n\nadded in May 2001. Currently, the first plaintiffs have four (4) plants in Malaysia and\n\nthree (3) in Indonesia manufacturing PCBA using SMT.50.    The first defendant refuted the plaintiffs’ claim that the\n\nJVA was terminated because the second plaintiffs did not get a listing. Indeed, the JVA\n\nprovided for that eventuality (clause 10.2) by a share swap provision should the second\n\nplaintiffs fail to be listed on either the SGX or Nasdaq Exchange in the United States.\n\nThe JVA was terminated because the first plaintiffs recruited the CEO (KY Wong) from\n\nCompaq Computers who brought in a whole team (35) of new staff including senior managers\n\nand set up a corporate department. The CEO and his team not only duplicated the activities\n\nof the second plaintiffs but also went into direct competition with the second plaintiffs\n\nin the areas of marketing, program management and materials procurement. Serious marketing\n\nconflicts resulted causing confusion amongst customers some of whom called up the second\n\nplaintiffs to inquire who they should actually deal with. The CEO referred business\n\nprocured in Singapore to the first plaintiffs’ plants in Malaysia and Indonesia.51.    The first and third defendants had made a trip to the United\n\nStates in October 2000 to meet potential customers and to identify suitable marketing\n\nrepresentatives. During their trip, they had also identified a potential site to start a\n\npilot run line to build prototypes. After their return to Singapore, the two (2)\n\ndefendants put forward the proposal to a meeting of the board of directors of the second\n\nplaintiffs only to have it vetoed by the CEO who indicated that, the first plaintiffs\n\nintended to have such an operation in the United States. Further, the CEO instructed the\n\ntwo defendants not to pursue anymore business opportunities in the United States or make\n\nany overseas trips (save for Batam and Penang) without his prior approval.52.    From about July/August 2000 onwards, the second plaintiffs\n\nstarted experiencing cash flow problems because of the first plaintiffs’ failure to\n\nprovide funding. The problem became so serious that suppliers refused to supply parts to\n\nthe second plaintiffs in the last quarter of 2000, causing delays in production and\n\nresulting in an erosion of customers’ confidence.53.    A letter dated 23 October 2000 from the first plaintiffs was sent\n\nto the first, second and third defendants, threatening to oust the management control of\n\nthe plaintiffs after 31 December 2000, should the second plaintiffs fail to achieve a\n\npre-tax profit of $1.5m for the second half of 2000. This threat was made despite the fact\n\nthat the JVA did not stipulate any minimum performance targets. The first defendant had\n\nsigned but, subsequently cancelled his signature on, the letter; he was unhappy with the\n\ncontents and his feelings were shared by the second and third defendants.54.    At end December 2000 or early January 2001, the CEO approached\n\nthe first defendant and suggested the termination of the JVA. After discussing the\n\nproposal with the second and third defendants, the first defendant reluctantly agreed. The\n\nCEO then arranged for the necessary documentation to be drawn up and signed on 9 February\n\n2001. Three (3) days later, the CEO informed the first and second defendants that\n\nfunctions of the second plaintiffs in materials procurement, program management and\n\nmarketing would be taken out of their hands (as well as from the third defendant) and\n\nhanded over to the corporate department of the first plaintiffs with immediate effect. The\n\ndefendants were further instructed to outsource the second plaintiffs’ warehousing\n\nfunction to a third party.55.    The changes implemented by the CEO meant that effectively the\n\nthird defendant no longer had any working responsibilities and it was redundant for the\n\nsecond plaintiffs to have the services of both the first and second defendants.\n\nConsequently, the first, second and third defendants found their positions untenable and\n\neventually all three (3), together with the fourth defendant, tendered their resignations.56.    The first defendant denied he had removed all data from his\n\ncomputer covering the period February to May, 2001. He deleted all e-mails from his\n\ncomputer prior to leaving the second plaintiffs, as part of the handing over process.\n\nIndeed, it was his practice to delete e-mails/documents periodically in the course of his\n\nwork. Where the e-mails were relevant to the operations of the company, the first\n\ndefendant said copies had already been printed out and filed in the respective files in\n\nthe second plaintiffs’ office. Chau's assistant had checked his computer one day\n\nbefore his departure from the company to make sure that he had deleted all the data.57.    The first defendant also refuted the plaintiffs’ allegation\n\nthat he had (together with the second and third defendants) prepared and provided to the\n\nsecond plaintiffs the accounts for the period July 2000 to January 2001. The accounting\n\nsystem was set up by the then general manager of the first plaintiffs (one Yong Poh Choo)\n\nwho employed an accounts clerk and both were responsible for the preparation and\n\nmanagement of the second plaintiffs’ accounts until June 2000, when the Finance\n\nManager Keith Ong took over. For such accounting support from the first plaintiffs, the\n\nsecond plaintiffs had to pay the former $5,000 per month under cl 4.2 of the JVA.58.    The first defendant referred to the second plaintiffs’\n\ncheque signatories as another form of monitoring by the first of the second plaintiffs, on\n\nwhich Zing's testimony has already been set out (para 31[iii]supra).59.    The first defendant pointed out that neither he nor the second or\n\nthe third defendants, had accounting training or background. They relied on the accounting\n\ninformation provided by Keith Ong to keep track of the performance of the second\n\nplaintiffs. He revealed that in December 2000, Ong Ah Whatt, the chairman of the first\n\nplaintiffs had expressed dissatisfaction over the performance of Keith Ong and indicated\n\nthat the latter’s services should be terminated. Keith Ong left in January 2001 and\n\nMark Tan from the first plaintiffs’ office took over his position. It was after Mark\n\nTan took over and discovered errors in bookkeeping that, an internal audit was conducted\n\nand subsequently verified by KPMG.60.    The first defendant denied any wrongdoing as regards advanced\n\nbilling and pointed out that the practice continued in the case of Advent, after he left\n\nthe second plaintiffs. The principal reason behind Advent’s request for advanced\n\nbilling was to enable the company to capture the transaction in their financial records by\n\na certain time-frame in order to close their books. In the case of Ericsson, the company\n\nwas invoiced in January 2001 for work already completed at that point in time on PCBAs.\n\nSuch advanced billing was only done for products which were very close to completion.61.    The second defendant also worked at SCI (for 6 years) before he\n\njoined the second plaintiffs. Like the first defendant, he was not involved in product\n\ndesign or the actual designing process nor did he have the expertise. He had prepared the\n\nbusiness plan together with the third defendant. He said the plan comprised of a general\n\nbusiness model adopted by major players in the industry including Solectron Corporation,\n\nSCI and, Celestica Incorporated. Many contract manufacturers such as Flextronics\n\nInternational Ltd, Omni Industries Ltd and Venture Manufacturing (S) Ltd utilised the\n\nbusiness model. He, the third and fourth defendants were former colleagues at Thomson\n\nConsumer Electronics Pte Ltd (Thomson).62.    The second defendant denied the plaintiffs’ allegation that\n\nthe business plan made known to Tri-M the existing customer base of the second plaintiffs.\n\nSome customers of the second plaintiffs (such as Creative Technology and Ericsson) were\n\nnot exclusive but, were common to other contract manufacturers while others (IBM,\n\nMatsushita) were not customers of the second plaintiffs at the material time.63 The business plan also did not involve any proprietary or\n\nconfidential information of the second plaintiffs. The second defendant pointed out that\n\nTri-M had been in PCBA contract manufacturing since about 1987, utilising SMT.64. Like the first defendant, the second defendant blamed Keith Ong for\n\nthe accounting/book-keeping debacle. After the CEO was recruited, the CEO requested the\n\nsecond defendant to prepare a chart of budgeted and actual profits before tax (the\n\nplink-plink charts). The second defendant carried out the CEO’s instructions based\n\npurely on information gleaned from monthly profit & loss statements prepared/provided\n\nby Keith Ong.65. As for the third defendant, his testimony was not very different\n\nfrom the first or second defendant's, on the areas of his responsibilities and expertise.\n\nHe was in the employment of Philips (for 13 years) before he went to SCI (for 6 years) and\n\nthen joined the second plaintiffs. Prior to working for the second plaintiffs, the third\n\ndefendant said he already had excellent working relationships with such companies as\n\nMatsushita, Philips, Wincor-Nixdorf Pte Ltd, BTC Power Inc, Hewlett-Packard and Allied\n\nTelesyn International (Asia) Pte Ltd, due to either his personal contacts or, the fact\n\nthat he had classmates or ex-colleagues in those organisations.66. The third defendant had a different version from the\n\nplaintiffs’ of what transpired on 4 May 2001. He said Chau had approached him that\n\nafternoon to say some other user needed his computer urgently. The third defendant\n\ninformed Chau he had personal data (in his e-mail) which he wished to retain. Chau\n\nsuggested that the third defendant 'zip' and 'unzip' his files which instructions the\n\nlatter could not understand. Consequently, the third defendant asked for Chau’s help\n\nto down-load the data (including some golf jokes) from his in-box to the third\n\ndefendant’s e-mail account; Chau agreed. However, Chau subsequently found the\n\ndownloading process too time-consuming and suggested that the third defendant copy the\n\ndata onto diskettes instead. Chau was in the midst of such copying when Ms Yong came. The\n\ndiskettes were then handed to the third defendant who bent them in Chau’s presence\n\nand handed them back to Chau.67. The fourth defendant also came from SCI where he spent six (6)\n\nyears as a design engineering manager. Prior thereto, he was with Thomson for six (6)\n\nyears designing test equipment for television modules such as tuners and satellite\n\ndecoders. He had also worked on 1394 'firewire' interface cards before joining the second\n\nplaintiffs. This item is a standard protocol which was conceived by Apple Computers in\n\n1986. Yet, the plaintiffs had included it in their interim injunction as a product which\n\nthe defendants were restrained from dealing with, in relation to 'generic' customers. The\n\nfourth defendant made similar comments on the POS (point of sale) printer board, relating\n\nagain to 'generic' customers, included in the interim injunction. He pointed out that such\n\nprinters are universally utilised by retailers and sales outlets to record\n\nsales/purchases, an evolution from the old cash register system.68. The fourth defendant explained the process of SMT; the technology\n\ninvolved mounting various chip components onto the surface of a PCB, replacing the\n\nprevious through-hole technology of the early 1980s. He also explained the designing\n\nprocess for PCB which confidential information and design he reiterated, is the property\n\nof the customer. The fourth defendant echoed Leslie's testimony that various types of CAD\n\nsoftware are easily available from the market to assist in the design of PCBs.69. A prayer in the plaintiffs' application for an interim injunction\n\nwas to restrain the first, second and third defendants from soliciting, enticing or\n\ninterfering with customers who dealt in set-up boxes (see annexure A to court order for\n\ninterim injunction) namely, Union Tech and ViewInternet.com. In his affidavit, the fourth\n\ndefendant deposed that set-up boxes are generic products readily available from the market\n\nand companies like Philips, Acer Computer International Ltd and General Instruments (S)\n\nPte Ltd produce a multitude of set-up boxes. He himself had worked extensively on set-up\n\nboxes while he was with SCI.70. The fourth defendant also pointed out that a number of other\n\nproducts covered by the plaintiffs' interim injunction wereeithernot produced by\n\nthe second plaintiffs at the material time for the customers they had identifiedor,\n\nwere not unique to the second plaintiffs. One example of the first category was LCD TV\n\ndisplay although, prior to the date of the interim injunction, the defendants had been\n\napproached by Philips in relation to a project called I-Conn, for the production, not\n\ndesign, of LCD display. Another example of this category was iJuke Box for Serial System\n\nrelating to internet jukebox. He named Eagle Wireless, Plexus, Union Tech,\n\nViewInternet.com and Hewlett-Packard as companies the defendants hadnodealings\n\nwith, from the time they left the second plaintiffs' services until the date of the\n\ninterim injunction. I should point that in the course of cross-examining the first\n\ndefendant, counsel for the plaintiffs produced a fresh list (see 1AB1443) of 25\n\n'potential' customers of PCB contract manufacturers.71. The fourth defendant criticised the description of some products\n\ncovered by the interim injunction as 'vague' citing as an example home gateway product\n\n(also known as residential gateways); it refers to a broad range of devices that enables\n\nthe interconnection of the internet with the home network.72. The fourth defendant revealed that even before he tendered his\n\nresignation, the plaintiffs had found his replacement in the person of one Augustine Yap,\n\nan experienced designer, who was introduced to him on or about 2 March 2001 by a senior\n\nvice-president (Wee Tai Seng) of the first plaintiffs; Augustine Yap joined the second\n\nplaintiffs before the fourth defendant departed from the second plaintiffs (on 24 May\n\n2001). The fourth defendant felt his position was undermined especially when Augustine\n\nYap's last drawn salary was higher than his. This, coupled together with constant\n\nharassment from vendors for payments which were overdue and disappointment over the\n\nfailure to list the second plaintiffs on the SGX, prompted the fourth defendant to resign\n\nfrom the second plaintiffs. As far as he was concerned, it did not matter to him whether\n\nhe secured a position with Tri-M after he left; he was prepared to take up any job.73. One issue which cropped up during the cross-examination of the\n\nfirst and third defendants turned on the question of the defendants' supplementary list of\n\ndocuments (filed on 22 November 2001) which items inter alia comprised of the second\n\nplaintiffs' accounts, e-mails and the business plan. Questioned, the first defendant said\n\nhe was told by the third defendant that the documents were received in early September\n\n2001, in a parcel addressed to Tri-M's management. The third defendant testified he took\n\nthe documents from the reception counter of Tri-M; he did not know how the documents were\n\ndelivered nor who the sender was. He suspected that the sender could have been some\n\ndisgruntled employee(s) of the second plaintiffs. After receiving the documents, the third\n\ndefendant passed them to the fourth defendant for on-forwarding to their counsel.74. Another issue on which the first, second and third defendants were\n\ncross-examined at length related to when and how the business plan came into fruition and,\n\nin the case of the third defendant, on whether there was a revised plan (which there was).\n\nIn his written testimony, the first defendant had deposed that he had prepared the\n\nbusiness plan jointly with the third defendant. However, in cross-examination it emerged\n\nthat the second defendant was its brainchild and, that the third defendant consulted the\n\nfirst defendant, after the second defendant had prepared the business plan. The third\n\ndefendant was then (in March 2001) looking for a job and he wanted the first defendant's\n\ncomments on the business plan. The third defendant had approached the second defendant for\n\nhelp because the latter was very familiar with software. At the time, the third defendant\n\nmade it clear to the first defendant that there was no vacancy for the latter in Tri-M.\n\nfor whom (the third defendant had indicated) the business plan was prepared, to help turn\n\nthe company around. It was only in mid-May 2001, that the first defendant received a call\n\nfrom Tri-M's management saying the company had an opening for him (after the then chief\n\noperating officer retired). However, this wasafterthe first defendant had already\n\ntendered his resignation (on 4 May 2001) to the second plaintiffs.75. Considerable time was also spent in cross-examining the first\n\ndefendant on the substantial number of former employees of the second plaintiffs who had\n\nsince joined Tri-M's services. The first defendant denied he had instigated these persons\n\nto leave the second plaintiffs. When the second defendant testified, he said some of the\n\nformer staff of the second plaintiffs approached him for positions at Tri-M, after he had\n\nresigned. He believed the 35 odd employees who resigned were unhappy with the termination\n\nof the JVA; they were concerned when the second defendant resigned because they had worked\n\nwith him previously for some seven (7) years. Hence, they opted to join Tri-M even though\n\nit was then a loss-making company. He pointed out that some 45 employees were originally\n\nfrom SCI, of which 30 eventually joined Tri-M. I should add that the plaintiffs' closing\n\nsubmissions (para 38) that the defendants negotiated contracts for over 30 employees of\n\nthe second plaintiffs, is not supported by any evidence.76. At this juncture, some mention should be made of the stock options\n\noffered to the defendants under the JVA. According to the first defendant, the exercise\n\nprice of 0.3866 was higher than the market price at one time; the second defendant\n\npointed out that it would have cost him $400,000 to exercise his option to purchase 1.9\n\nmillion shares at the relevant time when the market value was less than $300,000. The\n\ncurrent price of the first plaintiffs' shares is about 13.77. Counsel for the plaintiffs at one stage requested the court to draw\n\nan adverse inference against the defendants for their failure to call one MH Chai from\n\nTri-M to testify on an e-mail MH Chai had sent to Philips (see 1AB723) on the I-Conn\n\nproject, which document was included in the Agreed Bundle. I agreed with the defendants'\n\nsubmissions that an adverse inference cannot and should not be drawn under s 116(g) of the\n\nEvidence Act Cap 97 as, MH Chai was an employee of Tri-M who was not a party to these\n\nproceedings. Moreover, there is no proprietary right in any witness and, if the defendants\n\ndecline to have MH Chai testify, there was nothing to prevent the plaintiffs from calling\n\nhim and if he was a reluctant witness, by way of a subpoena. A document which was/is\n\nincorporated in the Agreed Bundle merely dispensed with formal proof — unless\n\nstipulated, the contents were/are not agreed.",
        "The findings": "(i) the JVA78. I start with the JVA. It is significant that the termination was\n\nnot initiated by any of the defendants but by the plaintiffs in particular by the CEO of\n\nthe first plaintiffs. The first defendant's testimony on this point was not challenged.\n\nConsequently, this immediately contradicts the plaintiffs' allegation that the defendants\n\nwanted a termination of the agreement when the second plaintiffs failed to obtain a public\n\nlisting. It was only the fourth defendant who testified (under cross-examination) that he\n\nfelt 'cheated' when the second plaintiffs failed to be listed because of his own high\n\nexpectations.79. The issue for determination is whether the plaintiffs' pleaded case\n\n(paras 23 to 25 and 55 of the statement of claim) against the first, second and third\n\ndefendants for breach of the terminated JVA is sustainable. Not surprisingly, the\n\ndefendants in their closing submissions argued that this claim was entirely misconceived\n\nas, there would be no obligations owed to the first plaintiffsaftertermination of\n\nthe JVA, citingChiarapurk Jack & Ors v Haw Par Brothers International Ltd[1993] 3 SLR 285in support (per Yong Pung How CJ at p 293). It is noteworthy that the plaintiffs\n\ndid not address this head of claim at all in their closing submissions; I can only assume\n\nthey have wisely abandoned the same. I accept the defendants' submissions; this claim\n\nfailsin limine. The fourth defendant was not even a party to the JVA so as to\n\nentitle the first plaintiffs to mount this claim against him. This head of claim is\n\naccordingly dismissed.",
        "(ii) inaccurate accounts of the second plaintiffs": "80. Earlier (para 28), I had referred to an extract (para 35) from\n\nChiam's written testimony wherein he had deposed to the first defendant's submission of\n\nthe inaccurate accounts of the second plaintiffs, for the second half of year 2000.\n\nSubmission is one thing, preparation is another. The plaintiffs alleged that those\n\naccounts were prepared and provided by the first three (3) defendants and based their\n\nclaim (para 25[ii] of the statement of claim) on an implied term in the JVA.81. It is trite law that where there is (as in this case) a\n\ncomprehensive document in the form of the JVA setting out the contracting parties' rights\n\nand liabilities, there is no room for the importation of implied terms. Zing (PW4) had\n\nrelied on cl 4.1(c)(ii) thereof to place the responsibility for the preparation of the\n\naccounts squaring on the three (3) defendants. However, this was against the evidence\n\nadducednotfrom the defendants, but from the plaintiffs' own witnesses and in\n\nparticular from Zing himself.82. It was common ground that Keith Ong (hired by Zing) was the second\n\nplaintiffs' Finance Manager who prepared the accounts. Based upon Keith Ong's figures, the\n\nfirst defendant presented the accounts of the second plaintiffs at weekly management\n\nmeetings. Why should the responsibility for the wrong figures be laid at the door of the\n\nthree (3) defendants and not Keith Ong? None of the defendants had qualifications or\n\ntraining in accounting (which evidence was not challenged), they were basically engineers,\n\nwhile Keith Ong was a qualified accountant. More importantly, the first plaintiffs charged\n\nthe second $5,000 per month for providingcorporate services. It would be most\n\nunreasonable for the first plaintiffs to be paid handsomely for such services and yet\n\nescape responsibility for what they did. I would add that the ultimate responsibility for\n\nthe accuracy of the second plaintiffs' accounts must rest with Zing, who was in overall\n\ncharge of the group's accounts as the first plaintiffs' Chief Financial Officer and to\n\nwhom Keith Ong reported, bearing in mind that under cl 4.1 of the JVA, the first\n\nplaintiffs had overriding supervision of the second plaintiffs. It is telling that Keith\n\nOng's performance was found to be unsatisfactory by the first plaintiffs' chairman so much\n\nso the chairman wanted the first defendant to terminate his services.83. Even if I am wrong in my finding and the first, second and third\n\ndefendants were indeed responsible for the preparation of the second plaintiffs' accounts\n\ngenerally and for the second half of 2000 in particular, what is the loss suffered by the\n\nplaintiffs as a result which justifies their claim? In their closing submissions, the\n\ndefendants submitted that as neither plaintiffs suffered any loss as a result, this claim\n\nshould also be dismissed. I agree that it is significant no censure of or any action was\n\ntaken against, the three (3) defendants when the accounting errors were discovered by the\n\nplaintiffs.84. The plaintiffs made an undue fuss about advanced billing which was\n\nin any way limited to two (2) customers, namely Ericsson and Advent. Apart from Zing's\n\ncryptic comment that the practice was not agreeable to the plaintiffs, no cogent reasons\n\nwere given by the plaintiffs to explain why this practice was wrong, when it was done at\n\nthe said customers' specific requests.85. Procedurally, it was insufficient for the plaintiffs to merely\n\nclaim for general damages (to be assessed) in their statement of claim (para 55). This\n\nhead of claim relating to inaccurate accounts if well founded, was capable of\n\nquantification and should have been claimed by way of special damages.",
        "(iii) breach of confidential information and or trade secrets": "86. The plaintiffs had alleged that in the course of designing and\n\ncontract manufacturing PCBs, the second plaintiffs either generated or came into\n\npossession (from their customers) of information of a confidential nature.87. In order to succeed on this item of their claim, the second (not\n\nthe first) plaintiffs have to first prove that the confidential information amounted to\n\ntrade secrets, in accordance with the principle enunciated inFaccenda Chicken v Fowler[1986] 1 All ER 617, namely the duty of fidelity owed by an employee to a former\n\nemployer is less than that implied in an employee's contract of employment. Accordingly,\n\nconfidential information concerning an employer's business acquired by an employee in the\n\ncourse of his service could be used by the employee after his employment had ceasedunless\n\nthe information was classed as a trade secret or was so confidential that it required the\n\nsame protection as a trade secret(emphasis added).88. The second plaintiffs must also prove they, not their customers,\n\nown those trade secrets. Finally, they have to show that the defendants made use of those\n\ntrade secrets for their own purposes.89. The plaintiffs did not particularise in their pleadings what trade\n\nsecrets the defendants had used. It has to be borne in mind that the four (4) defendants\n\nhave between them, more than fifty (50) years' experience in the electronics industry.\n\nThey all came from SCI, a competitor of the second plaintiffs, who had almost the same or\n\nsimilar customer base. They had their own contacts before they joined the second\n\nplaintiffs. What was/is so unique about the second plaintiffs' PCB design that could\n\namount to a trade secret? One should not overlook the fact that the fourth defendant is a\n\ndesign engineer who had, prior to joining the second plaintiffs, twelve (12) years'\n\nexperience altogether first in Thomson and then in SCI, designing various types of\n\nequipment including PCBs and set-up boxes. The second plaintiffs are only one (1) of a\n\nnumber of local contract manufacturers (including Tri-M), used by OEM companies for the\n\nsupply of PCBs and other products listed in annexure A of the interim injunction order. I\n\ntherefore answer that question in the negative. Even if the defendants did not work for\n\nthe second plaintiffs, they could have easily reverse-engineered to ascertain what\n\ncomponents went into the assembly of the second plaintiffs' PCB or other products. In this\n\nregard, I accept the testimony of the defendants' expert witnesses that schematic designs\n\nand Gerber files are easily generated from commercially available CAD software. In any\n\ncase, the plaintiffs did not call any evidence to refute what Roger and or Leslie said. It\n\nalso bears mentioning that the NDAs produced by the plaintiffs contradict their stand that\n\nthey, not their customers, own the copyright and intellectual property rights to the\n\ncustomers' designs.90. The defendants had included in their bundle of documents\n\n(2AB104-129) documents printed from the first plaintiffs' website. It contained a wealth\n\nof information including, the locations of the company's plants/facilities, its customer\n\nbase, its new customers and its financial health. Consequently, information so readily\n\navailable cannot be classified as confidential information.91. What of the plaintiffs' customers? From the evidence adduced, it\n\nwould appear that the second plaintiffs' customers or potential customers are common to\n\nother contract manufacturers, some of which are also publicly listed. It is not enough for\n\nthe plaintiffs without more, to produce a list of 25 companies (in 1AB1443) and assert\n\nthey were 'potential' customers of the second plaintiffs. The same assertion can no doubt\n\nbe made by other competitors of the second plaintiffs.",
        "(iv) breach of fiduciary duties": "92. The plaintiffs made much of the business plan prepared by the\n\nsecond and third defendants for Tri-M. Looked at in its proper perspective, what\n\nconfidential information of the plaintiffs did the two (2) defendants use in the\n\npreparation? The business plan previously prepared for the first plaintiffs was not\n\nexclusive to them. The second defendant had explained that it was a general business model\n\nused by many companies in the industry. The information contained in the business plan did\n\nnot come from confidential sources but was either available from public documents or named\n\ncompanies which were not/not yet, customers of the plaintiffs. It also bears mentioning in\n\nthis regard that no customer in the industry utilises just one contract manufacturer,\n\norders are placed by OEM with a number of contract manufacturers at any one time.\n\nConsequently, I find that the plaintiffs have not made out their case that the first and\n\nsecond defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the second plaintiffs as directors\n\nnor, that the first, second and third defendants breached their duties of good faith and\n\nfidelity as the second plaintiffs’ employees. The first, second and third defendants\n\ncannot be said to have breached their fiduciary duties to the first plaintiffs when they\n\nowe no such duties, after the JVA was terminated.",
        "(v) other allegations of the plaintiffs": "93. The plaintiffs had alleged that the first, second and third\n\ndefendants were instrumental in the departure of many employees to join the services of\n\nTri-M. I find that this allegation has not been proven at all. I have reservations on the\n\nveracity of Lau's testimony in this regard; he could not even tell the first from the\n\nthird defendants never mind the fact that he was found to have submitted a false medical\n\ncertificate to Tri-M. In this connection, the defendants have, in their closing\n\nsubmissions highlighted some of the inconsistencies in Lau's evidence.94. As for the deletion by the first, second and third defendants of\n\ntheir e-mail, again I cannot comprehend the fuss the plaintiffs made over the incident. It\n\nis not unusual for personal e-mails to be deleted periodically by a recipient after they\n\nhave been read as otherwise the inbox would be full and would not be able to receive any\n\nmore messages. Contrary to the plaintiffs' suspicions, there was nothing untoward or\n\nsinister in the defendants' acts. If indeed the data which the third defendant copied into\n\ndiskettes was company property, he did not in any event take away the data as the\n\ndiskettes were returned to Chau after the diskettes had been bent as a means of destroying\n\nthe data contained therein.95. In their closing submissions, the plaintiffs had emphasised that\n\nthey were not seeking to stop the defendants from working for Tri-M much less, restrain\n\nthem from earning a living. That however, appears to be precisely what they attempted to\n\ndo, when they first applied for and obtained the interim injunction, on 12 June 2001; the\n\nterms were so wide (not to mention vague) as to stifle the defendants completely.",
        "Conclusion": "96. I find that the plaintiffs have failed to discharge the burden of\n\nproof for their case. Accordingly I dismiss their claim with costs to the defendants to be\n\ntaxed unless otherwise agreed. The order of court dated 7 August 2001 varying the interim\n\ninjunction is hereby discharged. There shall be an inquiry on the damages if any, the\n\ndefendants have suffered as a result of the interim injunction obtained by the plaintiffs\n\non 12 June 2001, with the costs of such inquiry reserved to the Registrar.Sgd:LAI SIU CHIUJUDGECopyright © Government of Singapore."
