        "Q.       It was put to\n\n  you that you had no basis for withholding the cargo in March 2001. You said\n\n  that          you agreed. Would you like to\n\n  clarify the position": "A.       I stand by my\n\n  earlier answer.10. Whether or not Mr Ng conceded the point, there can be no doubt that\n\nFLE’s detention of AFM 2000’s cargo cannot be justified. FLE admitted that they\n\ngave AFM 2000 no notice whatsoever of their intention not to handle any more of the\n\nlatter’s goods. Mr Alex Ng said as follows during cross-examination:Q.       Prior to taking action to\n\n  withhold AFM 2000’s cargo, did FLE inform the latter that they would do so if no\n\n  money was forthcoming?No.AFM 2000 would have assumed that you would deal with their cargo as\n\n      you had always done?Yes.If you were going to hold their cargo, why did you not inform AFM\n\n      2000 about that?I am not certain about that.Q.     You are a senior management person representing your company at\n\nthis trial and yet you are unable to say why no warning was issued to AFM 2000 that you\n\nwould withhold their cargo?A.      I cannot comment on\n\n  that.11. I thus hold that FLE breached their contractual obligations when\n\nthey detained AFM 2000’s cargo. Damages will be assessed by the Registrar. AFM 2000\n\nare also entitled to a refund of the storage charges paid by them to FLE under protest to\n\nsecure the release of their cargo and to costs.C. FLE’S COUNTERCLAIM12. I now turn to FLE’s counterclaim, which relates to the\n\nallegation that AFM 2000 is responsible for the AFS debt of more than S$1m. FLE’s\n\ncase, as pleaded, is that around August 2000, Mr Steve Reison, AFS’ managing director\n\nand subsequently AFM 2000’s chief operating officer, represented to them that the\n\nfollowing terms will govern the future relationship between FLE and AFM 2000:(a) AFM 2000 shall represent the AFS Group of Companies and FLE shall\n\n    represent the Freight Links Group of Companies;(b) AFM 2000 will be responsible for and settle the debts of the AFS\n\n    companies; and(c) AFM 2000 will make payments promptly when due for all new business.13. FLE also asserted that in or about October 2000, two\n\nrepresentatives of NACA and AFM 2000, namely Mr Bob Hackett, AFM 2000’s managing\n\ndirector, and Mr Pece Gorgievski, the then vice-president of business development in the\n\nNACA Group, made the following representations to them:(a)    NACA were effectively the new owners of AFS;(b)    NACA wanted FLE to continue as AFM 2000’s\n\n    agents in Singapore;(c)    NACA was aware of the substantial debts owed by\n\n    AFS to them and AFM 2000 will be      responsible for settling\n\n    the debts; and(d)    FLE will\n\n  continue to work closely with Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell.14. I have no hesitation in rejecting FLE’s assertion that AFM\n\n2000 had agreed to be responsible for the AFS debt for a number of reasons. FLE’s\n\nwitnesses contradicted one another and their hesitant answers did not convince me that\n\ntheir case rested on solid ground. To begin with, FLE’s evidence as to when the\n\nalleged representations were made leaves much to be desired. Initially, they asserted that\n\nthey relied on representations made to them in July 2000 and that these representations\n\nwere subsequently repeated in writing. These assertions were contained in a letter from\n\ntheir solicitors, Ari, Goh & Partners, to AFM 2000’s solicitors, Drew &\n\nNapier LLC, on 23 March 2001. The relevant parts of this letter are as follows:2. The AFS companies, in the course of their dealings with our clients\n\n    incurred total debts which presently amount to in excess of $1,000,000.3. In about July 2000, it was intimated by Mr Steve Reison and Scott\n\n    Bell, who are presently with your clients that there was a change of ownership in the AFS\n\n    group and that Australian Freight Services Ltd was to be renamed … [AFM 2000] …\n\n    to manage the operations of the group. Our clients were given at the point to understand\n\n    that they were dealing in effect with the same parties and that the changes were in line\n\n    with the reorganisation being effected within the group. These oral representations were\n\n    subsequently followed up in writing.4. It was further represented by Mr Steve Reison and Mr Scott Bell\n\n    … [that AFM 2000] would continue to be responsible for the existing debts of the AFS\n\n    companies ….5. Our clients continued their business on the basis of the aforesaid.\n\n    It transpired in about early March 2001 that the AFS companies were being placed under\n\n    receivership …. Our clients have come to know that the AFS companies and [AFM 2000]\n\n    are controlled by the same parties.6. Our clients are by reason of the aforesaid facts entitled to lift\n\n    the corporate veil vis--vis the aforesaid companies to show that they are owned and\n\n    controlled by common parties. They will be making a claim against [AFM 2000] for the\n\n    entirety of the sums due to them.15. A comparison of the contents of the above letter and FLE’s\n\npleaded case will reveal fundamental flaws in FLE’s position. Contrary to what was\n\nasserted in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001, FLE conceded during the\n\ntrial that no representations were made in writing and no serious attempt was made during\n\nthe trial to pierce the corporate veil.16. Secondly, although Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March\n\n2001 referred to representations that were made in July 2000, FLE’s Defence and\n\nCounterclaim did not refer to any such representations. Instead, reliance was placed on\n\nalleged representations made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by a NACA team in\n\nOctober 2000.17. A question arises as to why the alleged representations that were\n\nallegedly made by Mr Steve Reison in August 2000 and by NACA’s representatives in\n\nOctober 2000 were not referred to in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March\n\n2001. That the alleged representations by NACA’s representatives are important to\n\nFLE’s case was conceded by Mr Alex Ng, FLE’s senior vice-president, who said as\n\nfollows during cross-examination:Q. The understanding reached with NACA’s representatives in\n\n    October 2000 is an important part   of FLE’s position that AFM 2000 had\n\n    taken responsibility for payment of the AFS debt to FLE?A. Yes….18. Mr Ng could not shed any light as to why the important October 2000\n\nmeeting with NACA representatives and the August 2000 meeting with Mr Steve Reison were\n\nnot referred to in Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23 March 2001. When\n\ncross-examined, he merely said as follows:Q. Given that the entire basis of FLE’s claim is based on\n\n    representations made in August and       October 2000, can\n\n    you explain why no reference was made to those representations in this letter?A. I have no explanation.19. Apart from being unsure about when the misrepresentation of facts\n\nwas made, FLE was also unclear as to what had been allegedly misrepresented. FLE was\n\nclutching at straws when they said that AFM 2000 must be taken to have assumed liability\n\nfor the AFS debt because they had been told that it was \"business as usual\" and\n\nthat after the formation of AFM 2000, Mr Steve Reison’s business card was similar to\n\nthat used by him when he was in AFS. The words \"business as usual\", if used,\n\nmust be read in their proper context. More importantly, FLE’s allegation that they\n\nthought that it was \"business as usual\" because Mr Hackett had represented to\n\nthem in October 2000 that FLE could continue to work with AFS’ stalwarts, Mr Steve\n\nReison and Mr Scott Bell, cannot be believed. It is most unlikely that Mr Hackett would\n\nhave represented to FLE that Mr Bell would be working with FLE for the simple reason that\n\nthe latter did not join AFM 2000 or NACA. In any case, it is rather odd that after having\n\nasserted that FLE felt reassured that they could continue to work with Mr Scott Bell,\n\nFLE’s Mr Alex Ng denied any knowledge of the fact that Mr Bell was not part of the\n\nAFM 2000 team. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q. You were assured that FLE could work with Mr Steve Reison and Mr\n\n    Scott Bell?A. With both of them.Q. How could that be when Mr Scott Bell did not join AFM 2000 or NACA?A. I am not aware of that.Q. Did you ever deal with Mr Scott Bell after August 2000?A. No.Q. In that case, you must have known that Mr Scott Bell had no role to\n\n    play in the new company?A. I am not aware of his specific role in AFM 2000.20. It is important to note that Mr Alex Ng finally conceded that as\n\nfar as he was concerned, it was his own perception that AFM 2000 had assumed liability for\n\nthe AFS debt. When questioned by me, he said as follows:Ct.    Did Mr Reison tell you that AFM 2000 were going\n\n    to pay the AFS debt?A.     No.Ct.    Is it your own understanding that AFM 2000 will\n\n    pay the AFS debt?A.     Yes.21. Apart from the uncertainties regarding the time and nature of the\n\nalleged representations made by AFM 2000, FLE did not act as if they really believed that\n\nAFM 2000 were responsible for the AFS debt. From the time FLE commenced business with AFM\n\n2000 in August 2000, no notice was served on AFM 2000 regarding the amount owed by AFS\n\nuntil after AFS had gone into liquidation. Admittedly, Mr Lee Hock Seng, FLE’s\n\nassistant vice-president, claimed that before Ari, Goh & Partners’ letter of 23\n\nMarch 2001 was sent to AFM 2000’s solicitors, FLE had informed AFM 2000 of the amount\n\nowed by AFS. When cross-examined, he asserted as follows:Q. Do you have any documentary evidence that prior to the letter of\n\n    2001, the plaintiffs were informed of the debt of the AFS Group?A. There were letters from our financial controller.Q. Are any of these letters in evidence?A. They are with our financial controller.Q. Is it your personal evidence that letters were sent to the\n\n    plaintiffs, demanding payment of the debts of the AFS Group?A. Yes.(emphasis added)22. Mr Alex Ng also asserted that FLE had sent AFM 2000 monthly\n\nstatements with respect to the AFS debt. When cross-examined, he said as follows:Q.    Is there any documentary evidence to show that before your lawyers\n\n    wrote a letter of demand, FLE informed AFM 2000 of the amount owed by AFS?A.    No, not\n\n  that I know of.Q.     I put it to you that no statement of accounts was sent to\n\n    AFM 2000 with respect to the AFS debt because they did not assume AFS’ liability.A.    We\n\n  have monthly statements sent to overseas trading partners.Q.     You just said that FLE did not send AFM 2000 any documentary\n\nstatement on the amount owed by AFS.A.      I was talking about a letter of demand. We sent monthly\n\nstatements of accounts of the amount owed by\n\n                       AFS\n\nto AFM 2000.23. FLE’s financial controller, Mr Thomas Woo, contradicted Mr Lee\n\nand Mr Ng. When cross-examined, he stated that he took no steps to inform AFM 2000 about\n\nthe AFS debt because \"internal senior people assumed the responsibility of collecting\n\nthe debt\". That no statement of accounts relating to the AFS debt was ever sent to\n\nAFM 2000 is patently clear from the following position taken by Mr Woo during\n\ncross-examination:Q.    From August 2000 until the matter became a legal problem, no\n\n    demand was made to AFM 2000 for payment of this large debt of $1m.",
        "A. No demand was made.": "Q. From August 2000 to March 2001, you never sent a notice of demand to\n\n    AFM 2000 to show that they owed the debt of $1m?A. No.24. Apart from not demanding from AFM 2000 the amount owed by AFS until\n\nafter the latter had gone into liquidation, FLE’s senior vice-president, Mr Alex Ng,\n\nagreed with AFM 2000’s managing director, Mr Bob Hackett, in March 2001 that the\n\ntotal amount owed by AFM 2000 to FLE was only around US$41,000. On 12 March 2001, Mr\n\nHackett wrote to Mr Ng as follows:I understand your position has been that AFS Freight Management 2000\n\n    had owed FLE around USD41,000 and therefore had exceeded your credit limit, so that\n\n    bookings were blocked by your system. Further, I understand that all you desire is that we\n\n    pay each other what we owe, and move on. This is all we want as well.25. On 13 March 2001, Mr Ng replied to Mr Hackett as follows:As you correctly said, our position has been that [AFM 2000] is owing\n\n    [FLE] about US$41,000 plus, details of which have been given to you. If you are agreeable\n\n    to this amount, please arrange to settle this urgently.26. Mr Ng made no reference whatsoever to the AFS debt when he stated\n\nthat FLE’s position has been that AFM 2000 owed FLE around US$41,000. AFM 2000 paid\n\nthe sum claimed by FLE even though they thought that the amount should have been a little\n\nless. FLE is in no position now to say that the AFS debt was not included in Mr Ng’s\n\nconfirmation of the amount owed by AFM 2000.27. If one looks at the whole picture squarely, much as AFM 2000 wanted\n\nto have a business relationship with FLE, there was no reason for them to cripple\n\nthemselves by assuming liability for the AFS debt, which amounted to more than S$1m. In\n\nparas 11-13 of his affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Mr Steve Reison, AFM 2000’s chief\n\noperating officer and the man accused of having represented to FLE that the AFS debt would\n\nbe paid by the new company, stated as follows:11. Immediately following the conclusion of the purchase of the AFS\n\n    Group by Trident, AFS sent a written announcement out to all customers, vendors and\n\n    agents, advising them of the changes arising from the purchase and how the accounting was\n\n    to be treated….12. The announcement made clear that notwithstanding the sale, all\n\n    transactions prior to 31 July 2000 would remain the responsibility of AFS.13. As the Defendants were agents of AFS, the fax announcement would\n\n    have been sent to the Defendants. In addition, I personally followed up with several\n\n    telephone calls thereafter to one Wang Tek Lee from the Defendants. During those phone\n\n    calls, I advised the Defendants again that neither Trident nor the Plaintiffs were\n\n    responsible for the debts owed by AFS prior to 31 July 2000.28. The announcement, which was sent to FLE, was in the following\n\nterms:We are pleased to announce that effective from 1stAugust\n\n    2000 AFS has undergone a change of ownership and has joined the N.A.C.A. (New American\n\n    Consolidators Association) organization.This change of ownership will also change our trading name to:AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty LtdThe previous structure of AFS Freight Forwarding operations, offices\n\n    and personnel will remain unchanged and it is business as usual….All invoices and credit notes up to 31stJuly 2000 in the\n\n    name of [AFS] will continue to be processed and reconciled from Brisbane and we would ask\n\n    that you refer any matters on this to:AFS Freight Management Pty Ltd[Queensland]All invoices and credit notes for business arriving 1stAugust 2000 and thereafter will be finalised in the name of the new company and we would\n\n    ask that you issue invoices/credit notes to the relevant office of [AFM 2000] as shown\n\n    below. All shipment documentation, bills of lading, and airway bills are also to be issued\n\n    to AFS Freight Management (2000) Pty Ltd.29. I have no doubt that this announcement did not put the position\n\nclearly. Mr Bob Hackett was honest enough to concede that the above-mentioned announcement\n\nregarding the setting up of AFM 2000 and the treatment of accounts with effect from 1\n\nAugust 2000 could have been more clearly worded. However, he asserted that whatever\n\nambiguities may have remained after the announcement, they were cleared up soon enough.\n\nWhen cross-examined, he said as follows:I can understand that if the announcement was the only communication\n\n    that took place with the agents, there could be a misunderstanding. The reality of the\n\n    situation was that all the announcements were followed by personal dialogue, telephone\n\n    calls and other communications that I believed clarified with potential partners that this\n\n    was a goodwill purchase and that the AFS debts were not acquired by the new company.30. Mr Hackett testified that he personally explained the position to\n\nFLE when he came to Singapore in October 2000 and that the FLE team fully understood the\n\nimplications of their relationship with AFM 2000. When cross-examined, he said as follows:I went into more details in the October meeting. I told the defendants\n\n    that Trident had purchased the business and not the company and that it had set up a new\n\n    company to handle its business. I asked them if they understood and they said\n\n    ‘yes’. I further explained that acquisition did not include debtors or\n\n    creditors. Mr Wang said that he understood and accepted that. He said that there were some\n\n    outstanding debts but I told them that they had to discuss these debts with the directors\n\n    of the old company, Mr Reison and Mr Bell. That was the end of the discussion. It was not\n\n    a long discussion.31. Mr Hackett’s account of what transpired at the October 2000\n\nmeeting was supported by Mr Pece Gorgievski, who categorically denied that representations\n\nhad been made to FLE that AFM 2000 would assume liability for the AFS debt.32. Taking all circumstances into account, there can be no doubt that\n\nthe evidence of AFM 2000’s witnesses is more credible than that of FLE’s\n\nwitnesses. As FLE has not discharged the burden of proving that representations were made\n\nto them that AFM 2000 would take over the AFS debt, their counterclaim against AFM 2000 is\n\ndismissed with costs.Sgd:TAN LEE MENGJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
