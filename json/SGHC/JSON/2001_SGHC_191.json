        "Brief facts": "2 The salient undisputed facts were as follows. An inspection by\n\ncertain officials from the Employment Inspectorate of the Ministry of Manpower was carried\n\nout on the premises of Williams Precision Engineering Pte Ltd (‘WPE’) at No. 6\n\nPenjuru Close on the morning of 10 October 2000. 21 Indian nationals were arrested\n\npursuant to the inspection, all of whom were subsequently found to be immigration\n\noffenders.3 The appellant was the sole proprietor of Master Labour & Cleaning\n\nContractor, a company which had entered into a contract with WPE to supply workers to the\n\nlatter. WPE would pay the workers’ salaries to the appellant, who would in turn pay\n\nthem over to the workers, after deducting a commission for himself. The 21 illegal\n\nimmigrants and overstayers found on WPE’s premises during the routine inspection on\n\n10 October 2000 were found to have been supplied by the appellant.4 Twenty-one separate charges of employing immigration offenders under\n\ns 57(1)(e) of the Immigration Act (Cap 133) were subsequently brought against the\n\nappellant. At the commencement of the trial, the prosecution asked to proceed on only two\n\nof those charges, and applied for the remainder to be stood down. The application was\n\ngranted by the district judge. As such, only two charges of employing immigration\n\noffenders were proceeded with against the appellant, and these were in respect of one\n\nRavichandran s/o Uthirapathy (‘Ravichandran’), and one Kalyanasundaram s/o\n\nPakkirisamy (‘Kalyana’) respectively.",
        "The prosecution’s case": "5 The principal witness for the prosecution was Ravichandran (PW2), who\n\ntestified that he had been introduced to the appellant by one Kumar, a fellow Indian\n\nnational who had come from the same village in India as him and whom Ravichandran had met\n\naround the ‘Tekka’ area in Serangoon several days before 6 October 2000. At that\n\ntime, Ravichandran had planned to return to India from Singapore on 6 October 2000 as his\n\nspecial visit pass of 14 days was due to expire on that date. Kumar however suggested that\n\nRavichandran should remain in Singapore to work so that he could bring some money home\n\nwhen he finally left the country. The latter agreed.6 On 6 October 2000, Kumar took Ravichandran and Kalyana, another\n\nIndian national, to the Marsiling MRT station. En route, Kumar told the men that they\n\nwould each be paid $50 a day for their services. When they arrived at the station, they\n\nmade their way to the void deck of a block of flats where they met the appellant, who was\n\nalready present and seated at a round table at the void deck. The appellant asked Kumar\n\nwhy he was late but it was unclear if any response was forthcoming.7 The appellant then told Ravichandran and Kalyana to sit and asked the\n\nformer if he knew how to write. Ravichandran noticed at this point that there were about\n\nthree or four pink Singapore identity cards on the table. He did not know however how they\n\ngot there. The appellant proceeded to hand over an employment application form to\n\nRavichandran and told him to fill it up. At this juncture, Kumar held up one of the\n\nidentity cards on the table which bore the name ‘Gregory s/o Packrisamy’ and\n\ncompared the photograph in it against Ravichandran’s face. He commented that the\n\nphotograph in the card matched Ravichandran’s countenance. Upon confirming this with\n\ntwo other Indian men who had subsequently arrived at the scene, Kumar handed the identity\n\ncard to Ravichandran and told him to fill up the employment application form according to\n\nthe particulars on the card. Ravichandran complied with the instruction and filled up the\n\nform as he was told. He filled in all the general particulars himself except for the items\n\n‘Religion’ and ‘Sex’ which were filled in by the appellant. When he\n\ncame to the ‘Education’ section of the form, the appellant referred him to\n\nanother form, and told him to simply copy the words ‘Form 6’ onto his own form.\n\nRavichandran did as he was told though he was unsure what the words meant. The section\n\n‘National Service’ was also left blank. Ravichandran then signed the form which\n\nwas subsequently dated 6 October 2000 by the appellant. Thereafter, the form was handed\n\nback to the appellant. The latter did not at any time ask Ravichandran where he came from\n\nnor did he ask to see any identification papers. The identity card bearing the name\n\n‘Gregory s/o Packrisamy’ was also subsequently taken back from Ravichandran.8 Ravichandran was unsure if Kalyana was also shown an identity card.\n\nHe recalled however seeing the appellant fill in a form for Kalyana, but did not know if\n\nthe appellant had referred to anything when filling up the form.9 The appellant did not tell the men about the nature of the work that\n\nthey would be doing. He seemed more concerned about the fact that they were late. Kumar\n\nhowever repeated in the appellant’s presence that the men would be paid $50 a day for\n\na 12-hour work day.10 After filling out the forms, the appellant took Ravichandran and\n\nKalyana to WPE in a taxi. At WPE, the appellant told the men to wait outside while he went\n\ninside. Subsequently, the appellant returned with a Chinese man who brought the men into\n\nthe premises and gave them their uniforms. No one at WPE asked to see Ravichandran’s\n\nidentification papers nor did anyone interview him.11 Ravichandran testified that the appellant and Kumar told him that if\n\nanyone were to ask for his name, he was to identify himself as ‘Gregory’. He\n\nfurther denied ever representing to the appellant that he was a Singaporean.",
        "The defence": "12 The appellant gave a diametrically opposite version of the facts\n\nconcerning his dealings with Ravichandran and Kalyana. His story was essentially that the\n\nmen were merely two out of several men who had responded to his advertisement in the\n\npapers for workers. He denied knowing Kumar, and asserted that the men had come to meet\n\nhim on their own in the afternoon of 5 October 2000. There, they showed him Singapore\n\nidentity cards, and according to the appellant, spoke, dressed and behaved like locals. As\n\nsuch, he had no reason to believe or suspect that they were foreigners, much less,\n\nimmigration offenders. He admitted however that he had filled in the ‘Sex’ and\n\n‘Religion’ portions of Ravichandran’s form, and had also filled in\n\nKalyana’s form for him. Thereafter, he told the men to meet him at the Marsiling MRT\n\nstation at 7.30am the next day so that he could bring them to their work place. The\n\nappellant averred that he dated the employment application forms 6 October 2000 because\n\naccording to him, WPE wanted the forms to reflect the date when the workers actually\n\nstarted work.13 The next day, 6 October 2000, the appellant met the two men at the\n\nMarsiling MRT station at around 7am. From there, they took a train to the Jurong East MRT\n\nstation, hopped onto a bus and subsequently proceeded on foot to WPE, where they arrived\n\nat around 10am.14 At WPE, they met Wilfred Ho (PW3) (‘Ho’), a Human Resource\n\nManager with WPE. Ho asked to see the men’s identity cards, at which juncture the\n\nappellant asked the men for them, and subsequently handed the cards over to Ho together\n\nwith the men’s employment application forms. Ho examined the cards and thereafter\n\nreturned them to the men. He then told the appellant that he could leave and that he would\n\ntake care of the rest. The appellant never saw either Ravichandran or Kalyana again after\n\nthat day.15 The appellant maintained that he believed all along that\n\nRavichandran and Kalyana were Singaporeans. He would not have agreed to employ them had he\n\nknown or suspected that they were not locals. He sought to justify his stand by pointing\n\nto the fact that the rate of $50 a day which he had agreed to pay the men was the normal\n\nrate for Singaporean workers only and that foreign workers could not have expected to be\n\npaid as much.",
        "The decision below": "16 At the end of the trial, the district judge disbelieved the\n\nappellant’s testimony and chose instead to rely on Ravichandran’s version of the\n\nfacts. In the circumstances, he held that the appellant had reasonable grounds for\n\nbelieving that Ravichandran and Kalyana were immigration offenders. Having failed to make\n\nthe necessary due diligence checks on their status as required by the statute, the\n\ndistrict judge found him guilty of the offence of employing illegal immigrants. The\n\nappellant was sentenced to 12 months’ imprisonment on each of the two charges, with\n\nthe terms ordered to run concurrently.",
        "The appeal": "17 The appellant appealed against his conviction only.18 There was in my view only one principal issue to be dealt with in\n\nthis appeal. The fact of employment was never disputed by the defence. It was conceded,\n\nboth at the hearing before me and at the trial, that the appellant employed both\n\nRavichandran and Kalyana. It was also not disputed that the appellant had not asked for or\n\nchecked the men’s passports and other immigration documents and papers. The entire\n\nappeal thus turned on the question whether or not the appellant had reasonable grounds for\n\nbelieving that the men were illegal immigrants. If so, then his failure to check the\n\nnecessary documents would render him guilty of the offence of employing under s 57(1)(e)\n\nof the Act. If not, then an order for acquittal would have been apposite.19 Upon a perusal of the record of proceedings, I arrived at the view\n\nthat the pivotal question in this case was a simple one of fact only, the key to criminal\n\nliability being whether it was the appellant’s or Ravichandran’s evidence which\n\nshould have been believed. According to the former, the two men had responded to his\n\nadvertisement for workers in the papers, and had represented themselves to him as\n\nSingaporeans by showing him pink Singapore identity cards when applying for the job. The\n\nthrust of the latter’s version on the other hand was that the appellant and Kumar\n\nwere together engaged in a scam to knowingly pass off foreigners as Singaporean workers by\n\npresenting them with sham identity cards and asking the men to assume the identity of the\n\npersons on those cards. This was thus not a case of having to decide if the circumstances\n\nwere such as to put the appellant on notice at least insofar as Ravichandran was concerned\n\nwith regard to his status and any argument by the defence to this end was thus wholly\n\nirrelevant. The upshot really was that if Ravichandran’s story was to be believed at\n\nall, then that story had to be taken in its entirety. In other words, the whole story\n\nwould have to be believed, which would in turn make any inquiry into the appellant’s\n\nstate of mind completely unnecessary. On a practical and realistic view of the situation\n\ntherefore, once Ravichandran’s evidence is believed, then the appellant must be taken\n\nto have been fully cognisant of the men’s status as foreigners, and himself an active\n\nparticipant in the whole scam to recruit and pass them off as Singaporeans.20 In the circumstances, the district judge found that it was indeed\n\nRavichandran’s testimony which contained the true version of the facts after having\n\ncarefully considered and reviewed all the evidence and materials before him. It is\n\nunnecessary for me at this juncture to repeat in detail the oft-cited caution ensconced inLim Ah Poh v PP[1992] 1 SLR 713and echoed in the numerous cases following it\n\nconcerning the treatment by an appellate court of pure findings of fact. Suffice it to say\n\nthat it is settled law that an appellate court would be slow to overturn such findings by\n\nthe trial judge especially when an assessment of the credibility and veracity of the\n\nwitnesses has been made. The only instances when such interference is warranted is where\n\nthe assessment was plainly wrong or against the weight of the objective evidence before\n\nthe court, or where the assessment was based not so much on observing the demeanour of the\n\nwitnesses but on inferences drawn from their evidence.21 In my view, there was nothing to show that the trial judge erred in\n\nhis findings in this case. If anything, the conclusions reached by him were more than\n\namply supported by the evidence before the court, and counsel was unable to persuade me\n\notherwise. I shall deal with each of the more pertinent points raised by counsel in turn.",
        "Ravichandran’s evidence": "22 The thrust of Ravichandran’s evidence damning the appellant was\n\nboth clear and cogent and well-withstood cross-examination. He was consistent throughout\n\nin his story of how he had been brought to see the appellant by Kumar, and how the two men\n\nhad arranged for Kalyana and himself to utilise and assume the particulars of sham\n\nidentity cards provided by the appellant and Kumar. Before me however, defence counsel\n\nsought to point out various inconsistencies in Ravichandran’s testimony which he said\n\nthe trial judge erroneously failed to give adequate weight to. He highlighted for example\n\nthe question whether Ravichandran might have sold his passport to Kumar, or whether he had\n\nknown Kumar in India prior to coming to Singapore. With respect, I found these\n\ninconsistencies in Ravichandran’s evidence to be but mere trivial inaccuracies and\n\nfor all logical purposes irrelevant to the finding of guilt. In any event, the trial judge\n\nwas more than acutely aware of these minor contradictions in Ravichandran’s testimony\n\nand in fact devoted an entire section of his judgment to dealing with them. Having done\n\nso, he concluded, as he was fully entitled to do, that any discrepancy was immaterial and\n\ndid not adversely affect the prosecution’s case. In the result, I saw no reason to\n\ndisturb the trial judge’s findings on Ravichandran’s credibility. It is trite\n\nlaw after all that in weighing the evidence of witnesses, the court recognises and accepts\n\nthat human fallibility in observation, retention and recollection is often inevitable.\n\nThis does not mean however that the whole of a witness’ testimony should be rejected\n\nsimply because certain parts of it may be technically inaccurate due to a genuine lapse in\n\nmemory whether due to passage of time or otherwise.23 There was in any case no conceivable reason or motive why\n\nRavichandran would want to frame or implicate the appellant nor was defence counsel able\n\nto point out to one. Ravichandran had already been dealt with by the authorities for\n\noverstaying and had completed his prison sentence by the time of the trial below. There\n\nwas thus no incentive for him to give false evidence for to do so would only open him to\n\nthe risk of punishment for perjury which I was certain was the last thing on his mind. In\n\nthe premises, I saw no reason to doubt the trial judge’s assessment of\n\nRavichandran’s veracity.24 With regard to Kalyana, defence counsel sought desperately to impugn\n\nwhat he alleged to be scarce evidence of the circumstances surrounding the former’s\n\nemployment. He submitted, somewhat tirelessly, that there was no clear evidence to prove\n\nthat Kalyana was similarly shown a sham identity card by the appellant and/or Kumar as\n\nRavichandran was vague and unsure about this and could only speak categorically for\n\nhimself. With all due respect, I found this to be yet another example of what was at most\n\na minor aberration, if I may even call it such, in the prosecution’s case. Clearly\n\nthe district judge was fully entitled to infer from all the surrounding circumstances that\n\nKalyana was in all reasonable probability hired in the same way that Ravichandran was.\n\nThey had after all both been brought to see the appellant at the same time by Kumar, and\n\nif Ravichandran was shown a sham identity card, then it meant that the appellant must have\n\nknown that he was a foreigner as a result of which, he ought to have been put on notice as\n\nto Kalyana’s status. This brought me back to the point I made earlier on how the\n\npresent case really involved an all-or-nothing scenario. If Ravichandran was to be\n\nbelieved at all, which he was, then his story had to be taken in toto. In other words, the\n\ncourt had to accept that the appellant was indeed involved in a scam to pass foreigners\n\noff as Singaporeans, in which case I failed to see how any other inference with regard to\n\nthe circumstances surrounding Kalyana’s employment could have been drawn. It was\n\nnave to suggest, as defence counsel did, that the appellant could have recruited\n\nRavichandran with full knowledge of the fact that he was a foreigner and yet remain\n\ncompletely oblivious to the possibility that Kalyana was, so to speak, ‘of the same\n\nmould’ when the two men were recruited simultaneously. The argument by defence\n\ncounsel therefore that there was no concrete evidence establishing the circumstances in\n\nwhich Kalyana came to be employed was thus completely misconceived.",
        "The appellant’s evidence": "25 While I had much faith in Ravichandran’s evidence, the same\n\nconfidence could not unfortunately be had of the appellant’s testimony. His story\n\nstruck me as being full of glaring loopholes, and further contained a host of absurd\n\nexplanations which simply could not be reconciled with logic.26 Firstly, although the appellant claimed categorically that\n\nRavichandran and Kalyana had approached him in response to his advertisement in the\n\nnewspapers for workers, no documentary evidence of such an advertisement was ever produced\n\nto the court, despite its easy availability. Next, the alleged meeting place of the men at\n\nBlock 157 Woodlands Street 13 was also questionable for several reasons. Firstly, it was\n\nnot the block in which the appellant lived, nor was it that of his labour supply\n\ncompany’s registered address. It was thus highly unusual for the appellant to require\n\npotential job applicants to meet him there, suggesting that the appellant might have been\n\nengaging in something illicit. Second, Block 157 is also some distance away from the\n\nMarsiling MRT station, as a result of which it seemed highly improbable that the men,\n\nblue-collar foreign workers who had only been in the country for slightly over a week,\n\nwould have been able to locate it by themselves. As such, the likely inference appeared to\n\nbe that someone had to have brought the men to Block 175 to meet the appellant, for while\n\nthey might have been familiar with the commuter-friendly MRT system, it seemed implausible\n\nthat they would have been able to find a block of flats amidst the complex matrix of a\n\nHousing and Development Board estate through their own devices. Next, the appellant was\n\nalso unable to proffer any convincing explanation as to why he should have required the\n\nmen to meet him at the Marsiling MRT station, which is located in the northern part of\n\nSingapore, in order to take them to WPE which is situated all the way in the west. It\n\nwould have been much easier, and in fact much more sensible, for him to have arranged to\n\nmeet them at the Jurong East MRT station directly but he did not do so. He sought to\n\nexplain away this curious arrangement by saying that the men would not have known how to\n\nget to WPE on their own, and that was why he had to arrange to meet them at an easily\n\naccessible MRT station first. Unfortunately for him though, I was given to understand that\n\nthe most convenient and accessible MRT station for the men, who had to take the train from\n\nBugis, was in fact Jurong East, and not Marsiling. To have them go all the way to\n\nMarsiling, and then bring them to Jurong East, would involve them having to change trains\n\nat least twice. On the other hand, the route from Bugis to Jurong East was a direct one\n\nwhich meant that the men could have easily gone and met the appellant there directly. In\n\nany event, if he had in fact believed them to be Singaporeans as he claimed, then there\n\nwas no reason why he should have assumed that the men would not have known how to get to\n\nWPE directly. In my view, the ineluctable inference from all this was that the alleged\n\nmeeting between the appellant and the two men in the afternoon of 5 October 2000 was\n\nprobably non-existent. What most likely transpired was that Kumar had brought the two men\n\nto meet the appellant at Block 157 Woodlands Street 13 on the morning of 6 October 2000\n\nitself, and having run late on time, the appellant subsequently took the men to WPE by\n\ntaxi. It will be recalled that Ravichandran had testified that the first thing the\n\nappellant had said to Kumar that morning was to ask why he was late. I very much doubted\n\ntherefore if there was ever an MRT ride from Marsiling to Jurong East.27 Moving on to the employment application forms, it will be recalled\n\nthat only the section containing the applicants’ general particulars were filled in.\n\nIt is telling that sections on ‘National Service’, ‘Next-of-kin’ and\n\n‘Employment History’ were conveniently left blank. Defence counsel sought to\n\nplay this down by pointing out that even Wilfred Ho of WPE did not question the lack of\n\ninformation in these sections when he accepted the men for work. I found this argument to\n\nbe completely lacking in merit. The stringency of WPE’s checks on the men whom they\n\naccepted to work for them was irrelevant insofar as the charges against the appellant were\n\nconcerned. Similarly, the beliefs that WPE or its employees held regarding the men’s\n\nstatus. In fact, WPE could itself well be guilty of the offence of employing illegal\n\nimmigrants, if it is found that they too were de facto employers and had not carried out\n\nthe necessary due diligence checks. All these, however, were not the issue in this case\n\nand it was not my prerogative to make a ruling on them. Whether or not WPE is similarly\n\nguilty of an offence remains to be decided at a separate hearing. For our purposes, I\n\nfound it sufficient to note that they were not the ones on trial here. As such, whatever\n\ntheir views and screening procedures, these certainly did not detract from or lessen the\n\nappellant’s own culpability. In my view, the fact that the appellant was content to\n\nleave out those details in the employment forms was highly suggestive of his knowledge\n\nthat the two men were not locals, which in turn, supported the prosecution’s theory\n\nthat the whole arrangement was nothing but a scam to deliberately pass foreigners off as\n\nSingaporean workers.",
        "Prosecution’s failure to call Kumar and Kalyana as witnesses": "28 The argument that an adverse inference ought to be drawn against the\n\nprosecution for their failure to call certain witnesses to the stand is one which has been\n\nraised countless times in appeals before me, albeit mostly unsuccessfully, by desperate\n\ncounsel in desperate need to get their clients off the hook. As was often the case\n\npreviously, I again saw no merit in that argument which was raised here. It is trite law\n\nthat not every failure by the prosecution to call a material witness warrants the drawing\n\nof an adverse inference against them under s 116 illustration (g) of the Evidence Act (Cap\n\n97). While Kumar and Kalyana’s evidence, if called, would have been relevant, and\n\nmaybe even helpful, the absence of them did not however have the effect of demolishing the\n\nprosecution’s case in any way. The uncontroverted evidence of Ravichandran was clear\n\nas to the circumstances in which he was brought to the appellant, as well as his\n\nsubsequent employment by the latter. That evidence was on its own more than sufficient to\n\nsustain a finding of knowledge on the appellant’s part with regard to the men’s\n\nimmigrant status. In any event, it has also been laid down innumerably that an adverse\n\ninference would only be drawn against the prosecution if it could be shown that it\n\nwithheld certain evidence which it possessed and not merely on account of its failure to\n\nobtain certain evidence. Further, such inference is often drawn only if the withholding\n\nwas motivated by some ulterior motive such as an intention to hinder or hamper the\n\ndefence: seeYeo Choon Huat v PP[1998] 1 SLR 217,Chua Keen Long v PP[1996] 1 SLR 510andRoy S Selvarajah v PP[1998] 3 SLR 517. In this case, no such suggestion of an\n\nimproper motive on the prosecution’s part was ever suggested by the defence. If\n\nanything, the prosecution had adequately explained that Kalyana could not be called as he\n\nhad already been repatriated to India by the time of the trial and was thus unavailable as\n\na witness. This was treated as an acceptable and valid reason for the failure to put a\n\nperson on the stand in the case ofJames Ong Phee Hoon v PP[2000] 3 SLR 293and should similarly be regarded as so in the\n\npresent case. With respect to Kumar, the evidence suggested, contrary to the\n\ndefence’s insinuations otherwise, that the police and authorities had tried their\n\nbest to, and had in fact exerted much effort in attempting to, locate him after\n\nRavichandran and Kalyana’s arrest. SSgt Shrmani Abdul Hamid (PW4) testified that he\n\nhad visited the Marsiling and Serangoon areas to search for Kumar, accompanied by\n\nRavichandran following his arrest, but the efforts to trace the elusive Kumar had been in\n\nvain. Nevertheless those efforts on their own militated strongly against the suggestion\n\nthat the prosecution and/or the police were deliberately withholding evidence from the\n\ndefence.",
        "Other miscellaneous points": "29 It remains pertinent for me to deal with a few remaining\n\nmiscellaneous points raised by counsel. First is the issue of the wage of S$50 a day\n\npromised to Ravichandran and Kalyana by the appellant. The appellant contended that S$50\n\nwas way above the market rate for foreign workers and he would not have agreed to pay them\n\nso much had he known that they were not Singaporeans. I again found little merit in this\n\nargument. Under the appellant’s contract with WPE, he would receive between $76 and\n\n$91 per 12-hour day for each worker that he supplied. Thus, even after deducting the $50\n\nwhich he had to pay over to the men, he still stood to make a handsome profit of between\n\n$26 to $41 per worker per day, which is hardly an insignificant amount by any standards,\n\ngiven that his overheads were virtually nil. Moreover, the fact that he was hiring\n\nillegals meant that he did not even have to pay the foreign worker levy, which meant that\n\nthe profit of $26 to $41 was all for his keeping. If anything, it appeared to me that the\n\nreason why he was able or content to pay the men higher than the normal market rate was\n\nprecisely because he knew that they were illegals and as such did not have to take the\n\nlevy charges into account when calculating his margins.30 Finally, there was the assertion that the prosecution’s failure\n\nto call the actual holders of the sham identity cards to testify ought to result in an\n\nadverse inference being drawn against them. As with the case of Kalyana and Kumar, I found\n\nthat there was nothing to suggest that there was any ulterior motive on their part in not\n\ncalling the identity card holders. If it was even required at all, I was inclined to think\n\nthat the failure to do so was but the result of a genuine oversight on the part of the\n\ninvestigating authorities to trace those men. In any event, I took the view that the\n\ndefence themselves could have called the holders of those identity cards as the\n\nphotocopies of the cards bearing the men’s particulars were at all times in the\n\nappellant’s possession. As such, even if the prosecution had failed to call the\n\nholders, there was nothing stopping the appellant from doing so. That he did not do so\n\nsuggested that any evidence which they might have given would not have been favourable to\n\nhim. On balance, I found this point about the absence of the actual holders of the\n\nidentity cards on the stand to be neither here nor there, and did not attach any weight to\n\nit.",
        "Conclusion": "31 As I mentioned at the start of this judgment, this was really an\n\nopen-and-shut case which turned primarily on fact alone. The oft-repeated caution on the\n\ntreatment of findings of fact by an appellate body has already been set out above and\n\ncannot be over-emphasised. Upon a review of all the evidence, I was not persuaded that the\n\ntrial judge’s findings in this case could in any way be impugned. The appeal was\n\naccordingly dismissed.",
