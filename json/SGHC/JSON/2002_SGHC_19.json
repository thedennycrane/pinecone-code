        "Evidence for the plaintiff: (i) Madam Jamilah": "14. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Madam Jamilah stated that\n\nshe was the sole director of the plaintiff and presently held its share certificate and\n\nwas therefore its legal and beneficial shareholder. Her husband had at times held the\n\ncertificate of the plaintiff, in particular, when he was planning to establish their\n\nchildren’s trust funds. The plaintiff was incorporated on 28 August 1996 by a\n\nSingapore company called ‘AZEC Worldlink Management Pte Ltd (‘Azec’). Madam\n\nOoi was instrumental in the incorporation of the plaintiff. She was then the managing\n\ndirector of Azec.15. Madam Jamilah’s relationship with Madam Ooi started in 1989\n\nwhen Madam Jamilah was working at the Kuala Lumpur branch of the Bank of Nova Scotia and\n\nMadam Ooi was working at the Singapore branch of the same bank. They got to know each\n\nother through work and thereafter became friends. They kept in touch even after both had\n\nceased working for the Bank of Nova Scotia. As for Francis Khoo, he was introduced to\n\nMadam Jamilah by Madam Ooi some time in 1994.16. The events leading to this action started in June 1996 when Madam\n\nOoi (who was then in the United States) telephoned Madam Jamilah and asked her to make a\n\ndirect investment in Agate as Agate needed US$100,000. Madam Ooi then suggested that Madam\n\nJamilah set up a British Virgin Islands (BVI) company for the purpose of the investment.\n\nShe advised Madam Jamilah that she could buy a BVI company for Madam Jamilah to use to\n\npurchase the shares from Agate. A few days later, Madam Ooi called again and said that if\n\nMadam Jamilah could raise the US$100,000 she would offer her 750,000 shares at US$0.12667\n\nper share representing a 10% share in Agate.17. Madam Jamilah agreed and the US$100,000 was paid on her behalf by\n\nMr Amin in two equal instalments. The first instalment was paid on 22 August 1996. The\n\nmoney was remitted to Madam Ooi’s account with Citibank. The second payment was made\n\non 2 September 1996 by a remittance to Madam Ooi’s account with the Citibank branch\n\nin San Jose, California. Subsequently, a share certificate was issued by Agate showing\n\nthat 750,000 shares were held by Just Gems Inc. This certificate was sent to Madam Jamilah\n\nin March 1997.18. Around early August 1996, Madam Ooi telephoned Madam Jamilah\n\nseveral times to discuss ‘a proposed divestment of Pacific Rim’s shares’.\n\nShe told Madam Jamilah that she and Francis Khoo directly owned the majority of the shares\n\nin Pacific Rim and the proposed divestment exercise was to remove one of the current\n\nshareholders and further, that the proposed divestment would involve Madam Jamilah (as\n\ndirector of the BVI company Madam Ooi was setting up for her) in the decision-making of\n\nPacific Rim. Subsequently, Madam Ooi informed Madam Jamilah that the plaintiff had been\n\nincorporated and was named Hazelwood Holdings Limited and suggested that the name be\n\nchanged. It was Madam Ooi who came up with the name ‘Just Gems’.19. Around the time of incorporation of the plaintiff, Madam Ooi\n\ntelephoned Madam Jamilah again and gave her more details about the proposed divestment.\n\nThe proposal was that the plaintiff would purchase 124,005 shares in Pacific Rim for the\n\nsum of US$500,000. This purchase, Madam Jamilah was informed, represented some 22% of the\n\nshares issued by Pacific Rim. Madam Jamilah stated in her affidavit that the foregoing\n\n‘meant that the plaintiff would purchase 1,000,000 Agate shares from the 4,500,000\n\nAgate shares held by [Pacific Rim]. Thus, my understanding based on [Madam Ooi’s]\n\nrepresentations, was that it was basically an indirect investment into Agate.’ It\n\nwould be noted that there was some confusion in the language which Madam Jamilah used in\n\nher affidavit as the first sentence quoted would appear to mean that the plaintiff was to\n\npurchase one million shares in Agate owned by Pacific Rim whilst the second sentence\n\nquoted referred to an indirect investment into Agate and therefore implied that the\n\nplaintiff would purchase shares in Pacific Rim itself rather than in Agate.20. Madam Jamilah went on in her affidavit to state that Madam Ooi had\n\nat first wanted the US$500,000 price to be paid before November 1996. Madam Jamilah\n\nindicated that this was an unrealistic deadline and Madam Ooi’s response was to\n\npropose that the plaintiff make an initial payment of US$200,000 and that the remaining\n\nUS$300,000 be paid by 31 December 1996. Madam Jamilah accepted this instalment plan.\n\nAccordingly, pursuant to the agreement, US$200,000 was paid into Madam Ooi’s Citibank\n\naccount on or about 16 September 1996.21. After this payment, Madam Jamilah realised that she had no\n\ndocumentation evidencing the agreement and asked for some. As a result, a meeting was held\n\nin Singapore on 26 September 1996 between Madam Jamilah, Madam Ooi and Mr Khoo. At the\n\nmeeting, Madam Jamilah was handed a memorandum dated 25 September 1996 addressed to her\n\nfrom Madam Ooi. Madam Jamilah asserted that this document contained, amongst other things,\n\nthe details of the divestment agreement.22. It should be noted that among the contents of the document were the\n\nfollowing:‘Subject: Staging of Equity structure.1. Jam [ie Madam Jamilah] subscribes 750,000 shares at 0.1267 cents per\n\n  share. Shares held directly at Agate. Equity position: 8.82% of issued capital of 8.5 mio\n\n  shares.2. Secure major stake at the Holding Co. PacRim Trading Ltd. This will\n\n  ensure pari-passu stake with other major shareholders.Propose divestment of 1,000,000 shares at $500,000 (50 cents per share)\n\n  if done before Nov. 96.1,000,000 shares would represent 22% of holding at PacRim and place the\n\n  stakeholder on par with other major stakeholders.In total, Jam and Co. will hold 30% of Agate Inc.’23. The next development was that at the beginning of November 1996,\n\nMadam Ooi faxed to Mr Amin a document entitled ‘Stock Purchase Agreement’ (the\n\nSPA) which had been signed by Madam Ooi but was not dated. The SPA read as follows:‘STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTThis is an agreement, effective ______________, 199___, between\n\n  shareholder/s of Pacific Rim Trading Inc, a BVi Corporation (‘The Company’), and\n\n  Just Gems Inc. (the ‘Purchaser’). The parties agree as follows:The shareholder/s of the Company agree to sell and deliver to the\n\n  Purchaser One Hundred and Twenty Four Thousand and Five Shares (124,005) of its US$1 par\n\n  value common stock (the ‘Stock’) for an aggregate purchase price of US$500,000.We further confirm that Pacific Rim Trading Inc. is a single purpose\n\n  investment holding company which owns 4,500,000 million shares of Agate Technologies Inc.,\n\n  a California Corporation. Your share purchase will represent a 20% ownership in Pacific\n\n  Rim Trading Inc.………………………_________________________Shirley OoiJust Gems IncPacific Rim Trading Ltd(Purchaser)’Madam Jamilah signed the SPA and it was faxed back to Madam Ooi on 26\n\nNovember 1996.24. Madam Jamilah went on to detail the payments that were made by her\n\nhusband to Madam Ooi. She then said that it was only in early 1998 that she discovered\n\nthat an overpayment of US$50,000 had been made.25. After the payments had been made, no further action was taken for\n\nsome time. Madam Jamilah said that she assumed that the share certificate for the Pacific\n\nRim shares would be sent to her later when it had been finalised. In the meantime, she had\n\nbeen appointed a director of Agate as a result of the plaintiff’s direct investment\n\nin Agate. Agate was then interested in setting up a Malaysian subsidiary and Madam Ooi\n\nasked Madam Jamilah to run this. As a result, in 1997, Madam Jamilah, Madam Ooi and Mr\n\nKhoo were in frequent contact with each other.26. It was not until some time in January 1998 that Madam Jamilah and\n\nher husband realised that no share certificate had yet been received from Pacific Rim. Mr\n\nAmin wrote to Madam Ooi enquiring about the share certificate and in this letter, dated 23\n\nJanuary 1998, Mr Amin described himself as the beneficial shareholder of Just Gems Inc. He\n\nasked that the share certificate for the shares in Pacific Rim be delivered to him within\n\n14 days. A few days later, Madam Ooi called Madam Jamilah and informed the latter that she\n\nhad been holding the share certificate in her own name as she was reluctant to transfer it\n\nto the plaintiff’s name because of cost constraints. Madam Jamilah told Madam Ooi\n\nthat this was not part of the agreement and that it should not have been done without\n\nprior authorisation from Mr Amin or herself. It should be noted that Madam Ooi denies\n\nhaving had such a conversation with Madam Jamilah.27. On 4 February 1998, Mr Amin wrote to Madam Ooi again as she had not\n\nyet formally replied to his January letter. Two weeks later, on 17 February, a response\n\ncame. In this letter, Madam Ooi confirmed that an entity whom she referred to as\n\n‘Just Gems’ had ‘at the time of subscription’ actually acquired\n\n‘124,001 shares of Pacific Rim Trading Ltd or 20% of the Company which represents\n\n900,000 shares in Agate Technologies Inc. (i.e. 20% of a total of 4,500,000 Agate\n\nTechnologies Inc shares held by Pacific Rim Trading Ltd)’. She then stated that\n\nPacific Rim’s corporate secretary had increased the share issue so that each\n\nshareholder in Pacific Rim would hold shares that would reflect his exact holdings in\n\nAgate. As a result, ‘Just Gems’ now held 900,007 shares in Pacific Rim. Enclosed\n\nwith the letter was a copy of a share certificate purportedly issued on 10 February 1998.\n\nMadam Ooi stated:‘Inadvertently, the corporate secretary had reflected the\n\n  shareholder as Jamilah Abu Bakar instead of Just Gems Inc. … I am requesting that\n\n  they amend the records and certificate and this will be forwarded to you when it is\n\n  complete.’28. Despite the promise made by Madam Ooi, no share certificate\n\nreflecting the plaintiff (whether by its correct name or by the description ‘Just\n\nGems Inc’) as the holder of 900,007 shares in Pacific Rim was ever sent to the\n\nplaintiff or Madam Jamilah or Mr Amin. Around this time, the relationship amongst the\n\nparties soured due to problems with Agate and its Malaysian operations. In March 1998,\n\nMadam Jamilah was removed from the board of Agate and the Malaysian subsidiary ceased to\n\noperate a few months later.29. Despite several meetings and correspondence between the parties and\n\ntheir various lawyers, the problems relating to the issue of the share certificate were\n\nnot resolved. In one letter, dated 10 March 1998, Madam Ooi stated that she had made a\n\nmistake in assuming that the shares were to be registered in Madam Jamilah’s name and\n\nthat as soon as it was corrected, she would get the certificate to Mr Amin. In another\n\nletter dated 22 March 1998, one Stephen M. Wurzburg, the attorney for Madam Ooi, stated\n\nthat he had in his possession the Pacific Rim share certificate of Just Gems Inc\n\nrepresenting 900,007 shares. He said that he was authorised to date the share certificate\n\nand deliver it to Madam Jamilah once she and her husband signed and returned the document\n\nwhich the corporate secretary of Pacific Rim would be preparing.30. By November 1998, Madam Jamilah was fed up. She instructed\n\nsolicitors to act on behalf of Just Gems Inc and, on 26 November, those solicitors wrote\n\nto Madam Ooi, at her address in Singapore, asking for the return of the sum of US$550,000\n\nwhich had been remitted to her for the purchase of the shares in Pacific Rim. Despite more\n\ncorrespondence and some attempts at settlement, the matter was not resolved and this\n\naction was commenced in October 1999.31. Although the reply filed by the plaintiff had asserted that Madam\n\nJamilah had not executed or signed any instruments of transfer in respect of the shares in\n\nPacific Rim purchased by the plaintiff, Madam Jamilah made no mention of this matter in\n\nher affidavit of evidence-in-chief. She was, however, cross-examined on the assertion. It\n\nshould be noted that six original instruments of transfer, one for each of the separate\n\ntransferors of shares in Pacific Rim, were produced in court by Madam Ooi as part of the\n\nevidence.32. Counsel for Madam Ooi drew Madam Jamilah’s attention to a\n\nmemorandum in her handwriting which was entitled ‘Hand Written upon Soh Boon\n\nHock’s visit with me in July 1997 at Nikko Hotel, KL’. Counsel pointed to\n\ncertain numbers written in the memorandum and asked Madam Jamilah what she had been\n\nrecording. Her answer was ‘Just the numbers’. When I asked her what numbers the\n\nreply was ‘The numbers that appeared on the 6 pieces of paper that I signed’. It\n\nwas put to her that those numbers were the numbers of shares the plaintiff was supposed to\n\nreceive under the SPA. Madam Jamilah’s reply was that it was not so as the SPA stated\n\nthe number as 124,005, whilst the numbers she had written on the memorandum had added up\n\nto a total of 124,001. When asked why she had recorded those documents, her reply was that\n\nit was when she saw these numbers that she realised the total number differed from that in\n\nthe SPA. She was then asked to confirm that the document she signed in Hotel Nikko in July\n\n1997 related to the purchase contemplated in the SPA and her answer was ‘Possibly,\n\nbecause I don’t know I can’t remember’.",
        "(ii) Mr Amin": "33. Mr Amin is an advocate and solicitor in West Malaysia. He is the\n\nsenior partner of his own law firm and is also a director of a BVI company called Parmoor\n\nInternational Limited (Parmoor). Parmoor was incorporated in July 1996 by Azec.34. According to Mr Amin, his role in this matter was limited to that\n\nof ‘paymaster’ on behalf of the plaintiff. In June 1996, Madam Jamilah informed\n\nMr Amin of her intention to purchase 750,000 shares in Agate using a corporate vehicle and\n\nasked him to make payment of US$100,000 on her behalf. He duly paid that amount by way of\n\ntwo equal payments, one in August and the other in September 1996.35. In respect of the plaintiff’s proposed purchase of shares in\n\nPacific Rim for the sum of US$500,000, Mr Amin confirmed that he had made payment on the\n\nplaintiff’s behalf. The payments were made as follows:(1) on 16 September 1996, he instructed Coutts & Co (Coutts) in\n\n  Hong Kong to transfer the sum of US$200,000 from his account to Madam Ooi’s Citibank\n\n  account;(2) on 6 November 1996, he instructed Coutts to transfer the sum of\n\n  US$300,000 to his own Maxisave account with Citibank, Singapore. He had also given\n\n  instructions to Citibank to transfer US$250,000 to Madam Ooi’s account. However,\n\n  instead of crediting his account with the amount of US$300,000, Citibank directly\n\n  transferred the amount of US$250,000 into Madam Ooi’s account. The remaining\n\n  US$50,000 was placed in a Time Deposit account in Mr Amin’s name;(3) on 20 November 1996, Mr Amin made a cash deposit of US$100,000\n\n  directly into Madam Ooi’s Citibank account. Thus, he had overpaid Madam Ooi by\n\n  US$50,000. At the time, he did not realise that this was an overpayment. It was only\n\n  discovered by his wife some time in 1998.36. In court he explained the mistake by saying that he had received\n\nconstant calls from Madam Ooi asking for money and had become confused. He also used this\n\nreason to explain why in a letter dated 10 December 1996 he wrote that to that date\n\nUS$450,000 had been paid and the balance of US$50,000 would be paid in December 1996.37. Mr Amin informed the court that Parmoor had purchased 200,000\n\nshares in Agate for US$700,000 in 1997. He brought this up because of what he considered\n\nto be attempts by Madam Ooi in her affidavit to confuse the payments made for the Parmoor\n\ntransaction with those made for the plaintiff’s transaction. The payments for the\n\nParmoor transaction were made as follows:(1) on 24 January 1997, Mr Amin debited US$15,000 from an account with\n\n  OCBC Bank in Singapore and transferred it telegraphically to Madam Ooi’s Citibank\n\n  account;(2) on 25 January 1997, he instructed Citibank to transfer US$85,000 to\n\n  Madam Ooi’s Citibank account;(3) on 20 January 1997, he did an international money transfer of\n\n  US$100,000 through Bank Bumiputra Malaysia Bhd to Madam Ooi’s Citibank account; and(4) on 7 March 1997, he obtained a bank draft for US$500,000 in favour\n\n  of Agate and handed this draft personally to Mr Khoo who then acknowledged receipt of it.",
        "(iii) Catherine Tan Eu Boon": "38. This witness was, at the material time, a branch support officer at\n\nCitibank. She produced documents relating to Mr Amin’s Citibank account for the\n\nperiod September 1996 to December 1996 as well as copies of correspondence from Mr Amin to\n\nCitibank instructing the bank to make certain deductions from his said account and credit\n\nthem to an account with Citibank belonging to Madam Ooi. The documents produced supported\n\nMr Amin’s account of the payments made to Madam Ooi from his Citibank account. They\n\nalso established that Mr Amin’s Maxisave account with Citibank was opened on 20\n\nSeptember 1996.",
        "Evidence for the defendant: (i) Madam Ooi": "39. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief, Madam Ooi first set out the\n\nbackground to the formation of Pacific Rim and Agate. She then went on to describe Madam\n\nJamilah as an ex-colleague who, in 1996, had expressed an interest in taking an active\n\nrole in relation to Agate’s subsidiary’s operations in Malaysia. To that end,\n\nshe had offered to take up a stake in Pacific Rim.40. The negotiations with Madam Jamilah were undertaken by Madam Ooi\n\ntogether with Mr Khoo, both acting for themselves as well as on behalf of the other four\n\ninvestors/shareholders of Pacific Rim. The negotiations culminated in the preparation of\n\nthe SPA which was duly executed by Madam Jamilah in late November 1996.41. Although Madam Jamilah and she herself were the ones who signed the\n\nSPA, Madam Ooi averred that a perusal of that document would show that:(1) the agreement was in fact entered into between the shareholders of\n\n  Pacific Rim (as vendors) and Just Gems Inc (as purchaser);(2) Madam Jamilah and she herself were signing in their capacities as\n\n  representatives of Just Gems Inc and of the shareholders of Pacific Rim, respectively;(3) the price for the purchase was US$500,000; and(4) in return for that sum, Just Gems Inc was to get a 20% stake in\n\n  Pacific Rim.42. Madam Ooi stated in 10 of her affidavit that the reason why Just\n\nGems Inc and not Madam Jamilah was reflected in the SPA as the purchaser, was because\n\nMadam Jamilah had informed her during the negotiations that Madam Jamilah intended to use\n\na nominee corporate vehicle for the purchase. Madam Ooi continued ‘Francis Khoo and I\n\nunderstood from Jamilah that Just Gems Inc was a bearer share company incorporated in the\n\nBritish Virgin Islands, and that she was the sole director and holds[sic]its only\n\nbearer share certificate’. In court, Madam Ooi conceded that quite apart from\n\nanything Madam Jamilah had told her, she herself had known that Just Gems Inc was a bearer\n\ncompany and that Madam Jamilah was its sole director and the holder of the bearer share.43. Madam Ooi indicated in the same paragraph that they had had no\n\nproblems with Madam Jamilah’s request to name Just Gems Inc as the purchaser since at\n\nthat time it made no difference to them whether the purchaser was Madam Jamilah herself or\n\nher corporate vehicle. In her next paragraph, Madam Ooi stated:‘However, as noted in my previous affidavit filed on 5 June 2000,\n\n  I have since found out that in fact no such company exists. Rather, there is a company by\n\n  the name of Just Gems Limited which is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, but as\n\n  it is a \"bearer share\" company, I am not in a position to ascertain who its\n\n  directors and shareholders are, and whether Jamilah had any link with the said\n\n  company.’44. I should note here that it appeared quite clearly from the\n\ncross-examination and from various documents that the evidence of Madam Ooi as set out in\n\n43 above was not truthful and that she was trying to convey a misleading impression. It\n\nwas patent that she had from the beginning been aware of the existence of the plaintiff\n\nand that its incorporation (like that of Parmoor) was procured by a company (ie Azec) in\n\nwhich she was a director and played an active part. It was she who had made the initial\n\nmistake of referring to the plaintiff in correspondence and documents as Just Gems Inc\n\nbecause she was used to the American nomenclature for corporations ie the use of the word\n\n‘Inc’ meaning ‘incorporated’ at the end of a corporate body’s\n\nname and had forgotten that for a BVI company, the correct descriptive word would have\n\nbeen ‘Limited’ or its short form ‘Ltd’. Madam Ooi admitted she had\n\nbeen used to using the words ‘Inc’ and ‘Ltd’ interchangeably.45. The very first document which shows the name of the plaintiff as\n\n‘Just Gems Inc’ is the SPA itself and that was a document prepared by Madam Ooi\n\nherself not Madam Jamilah. It was prepared around 1 November 1996 and by that time, the\n\nchange of name from Hazelwood Holdings Limited to Just Gems Limited had been approved (and\n\nthe suggestion that the company be called Gems Inc had been rejected by the authorities).\n\nThis was information that was in the possession of Azec and therefore available to Madam\n\nOoi. It is also notable that in the body of the document, Pacific Rim’s full name is\n\ngiven as ‘Pacific Rim Inc’ although in the signing portion this has been\n\ncorrected to ‘Pacific Rim Limited’. Madam Ooi was, clearly, extremely slipshod\n\nin the preparation of the SPA.46. Madam Ooi sought to portray herself as an innocent third party who\n\nhad been in the dark all along and had only just discovered the true position. That\n\ndepiction was far from the truth. She should have admitted that a mistake was made in the\n\nbeginning but instead she sought to capitalise on a mistake for which she herself was\n\nresponsible and which she perpetuated for many years.47. To continue with the evidence of Madam Ooi as stated in her\n\naffidavit, she then referred to the memorandum dated 25 September 1996 which she described\n\nas being ‘allegedly prepared by me’ and stated that some documents must\n\nnecessarily have been generated in the course of the various discussions and negotiations\n\nbetween Madam Jamilah, Mr Khoo and herself that eventually culminated in the SPA. This\n\nmemorandum may have been one of those documents though she did not specifically remember\n\npreparing it. Her position was that in any event the memorandum was at the most a\n\npreliminary document prepared to aid the negotiation process and it had been superseded by\n\nthe finalisation and the execution of the SPA. During cross-examination, however, Madam\n\nOoi agreed she was the author of the memorandum though she did not accept that its terms\n\nrepresented the final agreement made.48. Madam Ooi then went on to deal with the payments made by Mr Amin.\n\nShe said that subsequent to the signing of the SPA, and in purported performance of Just\n\nGems Inc’s obligations under the SPA, Madam Jamilah and/or her husband had deposited\n\nsums totalling US$500,000 into her account with Citibank. She said Madam Jamilah had\n\nrequested to be allowed to forward the monies payable under the SPA ‘throughme/my said bank account’ (italics are the witness’s). She reluctantly acceded to\n\nMadam Jamilah’s urging. I note here that there was no reason for her to have given in\n\non a point which made her uncomfortable. She could easily have provided Madam Jamilah with\n\nthe names of the various shareholders and the amounts payable to them and collected drafts\n\nin favour of these persons from Madam Jamilah.49. Madam Ooi claimed that although the sums totalling US$500,000 were\n\npaid into her bank account, they were not made for her account rather it was Just Gems\n\nInc’s manner of performing its obligations under the terms of SPA under which it was\n\nto pay a sum of US$500,000 to the shareholders of Pacific Rim. She was not entitled to\n\nkeep the monies for herself but had to (and did) account to the other shareholders for the\n\nmonies collected. This assertion was supported by oral statements by Mr Khoo and Mr Soh\n\nthat they had received the monies due to them from the sale but no documentary evidence\n\nwas produced to show the payments either to them or to any of the other shareholders.50. Madam Ooi denied that the plaintiff had made payments totalling\n\nUS$550,000 instead of US$500,000. She said the US$500,000 had been paid in four separate\n\ntranches. The first tranche of US$250,000 was paid on 6 November 1996 via a remittance\n\nmade by Mr Amin from his account with Coutts. The second tranche of US$100,000 was paid on\n\n20 November 1996 via a bank transfer. The third tranche of US$100,000 was paid on 30\n\nNovember 1996 in cash by Mr Amin to Ms Sim Sin Sin (a Pacific Rim investor and also the\n\nperson running Azec on a day to day basis) who then deposited the money into Madam\n\nOoi’s account with Citibank, Singapore. The fourth tranche of US$50,000 was paid on\n\n11 December 1996 when Mr Amin handed cash of that amount to Mr Khoo who deposited the same\n\ninto Madam Ooi’s account the same day.51. It should be noted that Mr Amin denied having handed Ms Sim\n\nUS$100,000 in cash on 30 November 1996 and that Madam Ooi’s bank statements do not\n\nshow a deposit in this amount having been made on that day. There was a deposit on that\n\nday of US$99,500 in cash which Madam Ooi said represented the US$100,000 as US$500 had\n\nbeen deducted by the bank as commission. Why the bank should have done that was not\n\nexplained nor was any document produced showing the payment of the commission. No such\n\ncommission appeared to have been charged in relation to the deposit of US$50,000 on 11\n\nDecember. Mr Amin admitted having made this payment to Mr Khoo but said that since he had\n\nno documentary evidence of the payment having been made, he had considered that payment to\n\nbe outside the present case. I take his statement to mean that he considered this\n\nUS$50,000 to be an overpayment as well but was not making a claim for reimbursement of it\n\nat this stage.52. Madam Ooi then dealt with the plaintiff’s claim that it had\n\npaid her US$550,000 by way of three remittances. Two of these remittances were not\n\ndisputed. These were the sums of US$250,000 paid on 6 November 1996 which Madam Ooi called\n\n‘the first tranche’ and the sum of US$100,000 paid on 20 November 1996 which she\n\ncalled ‘the second tranche’. The remittance in dispute was the remittance of\n\nUS$200,000 which the plaintiff claimed had been made in September 1996.53. Dealing with this disputed remittance, Madam Ooi referred to it as\n\n‘a sum of US$200,000 which was apparently paid into a Citibank account no. 01636005\n\nwhich Jamilah claimed belonged to me’. She stated that she did not have an account\n\nbearing number 01636005 with Citibank and that a perusal of the documents put forward in\n\nsupport of the plaintiff’s allegation of payment showed that the payment had been\n\nmade not by the plaintiff but by Parmoor. The Citibank account statements produced by\n\nMadam Ooi showed that her basic account number was ‘116316’ and different\n\nelements of the account contained the basic number but were characterised by different\n\nsuffixes and prefixes. For example, her ‘Maxisave’ account which was a Singapore\n\ndollar current account bore the number ‘0-116316-005’ whilst her\n\n‘Citiaccess’ account which was a US dollar current account bore the number\n\n‘4-116316-019’. Whatever Madam Ooi understood Madam Jamilah to have claimed, it\n\nturned out from the letter Mr Amin had sent to Coutts on 16 September 1996 that he had\n\nindicated Madam Ooi’s account number as ‘0116316005’ which was her Maxisave\n\naccount number.54. Madam Ooi went on to explain that Parmoor was a BVI company owned\n\nand operated by Mr Amin. Madam Jamilah had asked her to assist Mr Amin in establishing\n\naccounts outside of Malaysia for his business partners and on one of these occasions Madam\n\nOoi had referred Mr Amin to Citibank in Singapore. At this time Mr Amin had remitted\n\nUS$200,000 to Citibank in her name with the purpose of eventually opening an account\n\nthere. He also made the request that the bulk of the monies amounting to US$190,000 be\n\nconverted to Ringgit and be disbursed to him. This was effected by the bank and Mr Amin\n\nphysically carried the Ringgit away with him. The officer attending to this transaction on\n\n19 September 1996 when Mr Amin and she visited Citibank was one Nora Saini. Madam Ooi was\n\nsubjected to extensive cross-examination on her allegations relating to the payment of\n\nUS$200,000 and did not acquit herself well during that cross-examination. I will deal with\n\nthat when discussing the issues.55. Madam Ooi then dealt with the transfer of the Pacific Rim shares to\n\nMadam Jamilah. In March 1997, Pacific Rim’s corporate secretarial work was undertaken\n\nby a company in Hong Kong called Accel Secretaries Limited (‘Accel’). Madam Ooi\n\nthen gave instructions to Accel to undertake re-organisation work in relation to the share\n\ncapital of Pacific Rim. In May, Accel, Mr Khoo and Madam Ooi had a meeting to discuss the\n\nreallocation of shares from the existing shareholders of Pacific Rim to Madam Jamilah\n\nand/or her nominee.56. Subsequently, Madam Ooi received from Accel the instruments of\n\ntransfer that had to be executed by Madam Jamilah in order to bring about transfer of the\n\n20% stake in Pacific Rim from its existing shareholders to Just Gems Inc. As Madam Ooi was\n\nin California, she asked Mr Soh to get the documents to Madam Jamilah for execution and\n\nthen forward them to the corporate secretary for registration. Mr Soh did this. Madam Ooi\n\nwent on that ‘For reasons best known to Jamilah, the Instruments of Transfer [were]\n\nduly executed by her signing in her personal capacity (instead of signing for and on\n\nbehalf of Just Gems Inc)’. I note here that when the instruments of transfer were\n\npresented to Madam Ooi and then to Madam Jamilah they had already been completed by Accel\n\nand Madam Jamilah’s particulars were entered in those parts of the instruments that\n\nrequired a description of the transferee. As these forms were in Madam Ooi’s\n\npossession before they were seen by Madam Jamilah, it was disingenuous of her to say that\n\nMadam Jamilah had signed them in her personal capacity for reasons best known to Madam\n\nJamilah herself. As a director of Pacific Rim and especially as the director who gave\n\ninstructions to the corporate secretary, Madam Ooi had the responsibility of ensuring that\n\nthe forms were properly completed before presentation to Madam Jamilah. Mr Soh’s\n\nevidence was that Madam Jamilah simply signed the forms as presented to her in July 1997 .\n\nHe did not assert that she had made any changes in them.57. Madam Ooi explained the ensuing delay in the issue of the share\n\ncertificate by saying that Accel needed time to familiarise themselves with the matter and\n\nto deal with the relatively more extensive corporate filings required by virtue of the\n\nfact that shareholders’ loans totalling US$200,000 had to be converted into equity in\n\nconjunction with the divestment by the existing shareholders of Pacific Rim of a 20% stake\n\nin the company to Madam Jamilah or her corporate vehicle. Accel informed her some time in\n\nNovember 1997 that the share restructuring of Pacific Rim had been held up by the absence\n\nof various documents. The conversion of debt into equity was finally completed in January\n\n1998 and this resulted in an additional allotment of 620,003 shares to the then existing\n\nshareholders of Pacific Rim (ie Madam Ooi and her original co-investors, not the\n\nplaintiff). On 6 February 1998, the share reconstruction was finalised and on 10 February\n\n1998 a share certificate numbered R48 and made out in respect of 900,007 shares was issued\n\nby Pacific Rim in the name of Madam Jamilah.58. In her affidavit, Madam Ooi attributed the registration of the\n\nshares in Madam Jamilah’s personal name to Madam Jamilah’s action in signing the\n\ninstruments of transfer in her personal name and not in her capacity as sole director and\n\nbeneficial shareholder. This attitude was in contrast to the contrition displayed by her\n\nin March 1998 in correspondence with Mr Amin when she said that she had made a mistake in\n\nassuming the shares were to be in Madam Jamilah’s name and, as soon as this was\n\ncorrected, she would get the new certificate to Mr Amin.59. Madam Ooi dealt with the souring of relations between herself and\n\nMadam Jamilah and attributed it to, inter alia, differences in relation to the operations\n\nof Agate’s Malaysian subsidiary and the manner in which Madam Jamilah was running it.\n\nIn early 1998, Madam Jamilah and/or Mr Amin began a string of correspondence in relation\n\nto the purchase by the plaintiffs of the Pacific Rim shares and that correspondence\n\nculminated in them seeking a refund of the US$550,000 paid. Mr Khoo and Madam Ooi as\n\ndirectors and shareholders of Pacific Rim were open to the possibility of refunding the\n\nsum of US$500,000 to Madam Jamilah although they did not accept that there was any basis\n\nto her claim that the SPA had been repudiated. However, given (a) that the corporate\n\nentity Just Gems Inc did not exist, (b) the conduct of Madam Jamilah and Mr Amin in both\n\nclaiming to be the sole beneficial owner of Just Gems Inc and (c) that the Pacific Rim\n\nshares had already been registered in Madam Jamilah’s name they were advised by their\n\nlegal advisors to secure an appropriate indemnity from Madam Jamilah, Mr Amin and the\n\nplaintiff.60. Despite various attempts to reach an amicable resolution of the\n\ndispute, Madam Jamilah refused to co-operate on the matter and, instead, caused the\n\nplaintiff to commence this action against Madam Ooi and Pacific Rim in October 1999.61. I note here that under cross-examination, Madam Ooi conceded that\n\nin asking for an indemnity from Madam Jamilah and Mr Amin in relation to cancellation of\n\nthe share certificate in Madam Jamilah’s name and the issue of a new certificate in\n\nthe name of Just Gems Inc, she was trying to protect Agate from possible adverse\n\nconsequences of the mistake that she had made in relation to the issue of the share\n\ncertificate. She also confirmed that in fact she was the person who should have been\n\nresponsible to Agate for that mistake. Somewhat later, Madam Ooi conceded that she was\n\nalso the one who had informed the corporate secretary of Pacific Rim that the person whose\n\nname should be registered as the shareholder of the shares in question was Madam Jamilah.",
        "(ii) Mr Khoo and Mr Soh Boon Hock": "62. Mr Khoo’s affidavit of evidence-in-chief was short. He first\n\nexplained that Pacific Rim had not entered an appearance to this action as its lawyers had\n\nadvised it not to submit the jurisdiction of the Singapore courts because relevant court\n\npapers had not been properly served on that company. In any case, the plaintiff did not\n\nhave a case against Pacific Rim because Pacific Rim was not a party to the SPA on which\n\nthe plaintiff relied.63. Mr Khoo then referred to Madam Ooi’s affidavit of\n\nevidence-in-chief and confirmed the matters set out therein to be true. In addition, he\n\nstated that he had met with Madam Jamilah on several occasions to negotiate the terms of\n\nthe purchase by her or her nominee of shares of Pacific Rim from its shareholders. He was\n\nnot able to confirm that the ‘hand-written note’ on the back of the memorandum\n\nof 25 September 1996 had been written by him. In any case, the note had been generated in\n\nthe course of discussion and no agreement was contained in it.64. Mr Khoo was adamant that Madam Ooi had signed the SPA for and on\n\nbehalf of all the shareholders of Pacific Rim and that she had accounted to him and the\n\nother shareholders for the monies paid on behalf of Just Gems through her to the\n\nshareholders of Pacific Rim. Mr Khoo said that he had received from Madam Ooi the full\n\namount due to him for the sale of his shares to the plaintiff. He did not say how much\n\nthat was or offer any documentary proof of the payment. Finally, Mr Khoo echoed Madam\n\nOoi’s assertion that the register of Pacific Rim reflected Madam Jamilah as a\n\nregistered shareholder because she chose to sign the instruments of transfer in her\n\npersonal name instead of signing them for and on behalf of the plaintiff.65. During cross-examination, Mr Khoo confirmed that altogether there\n\nwere three investments made by Madam Jamilah or her husband two of which were direct\n\ninvestments in Agate and the third was an indirect investment in Agate. He agreed that at\n\nthat time Agate was in urgent need of funds. He also agreed that in 1996 he had been aware\n\nof Hazelwood Holdings Limited and that it had changed its name to Just Gems. However, he\n\ncould not recall exactly whether it was Just Gems Inc or Just Gems Ltd. Until legal action\n\nwas commenced he regarded Just Gems Inc as Madam Jamilah’s company and it made no\n\ndifference to him whether its name ended with ‘Inc’ or ‘Ltd’.66. In cross-examination, Mr Khoo asserted that the agreement by the\n\nplaintiff to invest in Pacific Rim was not arrived at in August 1996 but around the latter\n\npart of October 1996. He did, however, accept that the investment had been agreed to first\n\nand only later signified by the signing of the SPA. Mr Khoo’s memory proved illusive\n\nin regard to the memorandum of 25 September 1996. He could not remember either the\n\nmemorandum or the meeting that Madam Jamilah asserted had taken place on 26 September\n\nbetween herself, Mr Khoo and Madam Ooi. He was then shown the hand-written note scribbled\n\non the back of the memorandum and he agreed that the handwriting appeared to be his. He\n\nthen said that he could not recall whether it was exactly on 25 or 26 September when the\n\nmatter was discussed but that the hand-written note had been written during a meeting\n\nbetween the three of them. When asked why the memorandum had been produced, his response\n\nwas that it was a proposal for discussion. He agreed that by that date (25 September)\n\nMadam Jamilah had paid US$100,000 in respect of the plaintiff’s direct investment in\n\nAgate but could not recall whether a payment of US$200,000 had been made in respect of the\n\ninvestment in Pacific Rim.67. Whilst Mr Khoo disagreed that the memorandum had been produced to\n\nexplain to Madam Jamilah, and to document, her investments in Agate and Pacific Rim, he\n\naccepted that the first paragraph of it reflected what had been agreed and effected in\n\nrespect of the investment in 750,000 Agate shares. It was put to him that the second\n\nparagraph similarly recorded the agreement in respect of the indirect investment in\n\nPacific Rim. Mr Khoo disagreed and said that it was simply ‘a proposal of a million\n\nshares at Agate level and that would represent something like 22% … The idea was for\n\nPacific Rim itself to have an issued capital of 4.5 million shares so that one share in\n\nPacific Rim would be equal to one Agate share owned by Pacific Rim’. Mr Khoo did\n\naccept, however, that the negotiations in respect of the indirect investment did commence\n\nprior to 25 September.68. It was pointed out that in the SPA it had been stated that 124,005\n\nshares of Pacific Rim would represent a 20% holding in that company. Mr Khoo agreed that\n\non that basis a 100% holding would have comprised 620,000 shares. He confirmed that in\n\nNovember 1996 Pacific Rim did not have 620,000 shares. He asserted, however, that the then\n\nshareholders had loaned Pacific Rim US$200,000 and that there were company records\n\nconcerning the alleged loan. These records were not, however, produced.69. Mr Khoo’s attention was drawn to a document entitled\n\n‘Capital Structure and Shareholding’ and dated 15 November 1996 which had been\n\nprepared in relation to Agate. This document contained a statement that Just Gems Inc, a\n\nholding company beneficially owned by Madam Jamilah, had direct and indirect holdings in\n\nAgate amounting to 22% of Agate’s then issued share capital of 7,550,000 issued\n\nshares. He was asked what was the meaning of the statement that Madam Jamilah had 22% of\n\nan issued capital of 7,550,000 and his reply was that that was an estimated number. The\n\nfollow-up question was whether the statement had been an accurate reflection of Madam\n\nJamilah’s shareholding and Mr Khoo’s answer to that was ‘At certain points\n\nin time, it was’. Mr Khoo was also shown extracts from a private placement memorandum\n\nin relation to the issue of preference shares that was prepared on behalf of Agate in\n\nDecember 1996. Page 18 of this document contained a statement that Pacific Rim owned 4.5\n\nmillion shares in Agate and below that was a section entitled ‘Substantial\n\nShareholder’ which stated:‘Just Gems Inc, a company beneficially owned by Jamilah Abu Bakar\n\n  holds 750,000 common shares or approximately 11% of the currently outstanding 7,050,000\n\n  shares. Taking into account, Just Gems Inc ownership interest in Pacific Rim Trading Ltd.,\n\n  Ms Jamilah has an estimated total shareholding of 23% based on an issued share capital of\n\n  7,050,000 shares. It is expected that in December 1996, Jamilah Abu Bakar will be\n\n  appointed as a member of the Board of Directors.’Mr Khoo stated that he could not recall whether there had been any\n\nchange in the capital structure of Agate in November or December 1996.70. Various discrepancies in the two documents mentioned above were\n\nconceded to by Mr Khoo. He confirmed that notwithstanding statements made in the November\n\n1996 document that Pacific Rim owned 4.5 million shares in Agate and that the shares had\n\nbeen paid for in cash, as of that date, Pacific Rim did not have a share certificate for\n\nthose Agate shares. Further, although in the private placement memorandum it had been\n\nstated that he himself and Madam Ooi held their shares in Pacific Rim through a corporate\n\nentity, as of the date of issue of that memorandum, no such entity existed. Further, the\n\nprivate placement memorandum did not disclose Mr Soh’s position as a major\n\nshareholder of Pacific Rim but simply stated that Mr Khoo and Madam Ooi were directors of\n\nthat company with a controlling majority vote.71. Mr Soh Boon Hock’s testimony was brief. He was told in late\n\n1996 by Madam Ooi that Madam Jamilah was interested in investing in Pacific Rim and that\n\nthe then shareholders of Pacific Rim would transfer some of their shares to either Madam\n\nJamilah or Just Gems Inc on a pro-rata basis. He then referred to an authorisation letter\n\ndated 1 November 1996 which had been executed by him giving Madam Ooi full authority and\n\ndiscretion to negotiate on his behalf and to sell his shares in Pacific Rim.72. In July 1997, he received a call from Madam Ooi who asked him to\n\ntake some documents to Madam Jamilah for her signature. These documents were couriered to\n\nhim by Accel on 14 July 1997. One of the documents exhibited in Mr Soh’s affidavit\n\nwas a note written by Madam Ooi in which she instructed him ‘On the \"Instrument\n\nof Transfer\", pls obtain Jamilah’s signature as Transferee’. He then\n\narranged to meet Madam Jamilah at the Nikko Hotel in Kuala Lumpur. He could not remember\n\nthe exact date of the meeting but said it was during the period between 22 July and 24\n\nJuly 1997. At the hotel, he handed Madam Jamilah the documents entitled ‘Instruments\n\nof Transfer’. She signed them in his presence and returned them to him. He then sent\n\nthe documents back to Accel. Finally he confirmed that he had received from Madam Ooi the\n\nfull amount due to him for the sale of his shares to the plaintiff.73. During cross-examination, Mr Soh appeared rather vague about his\n\ninvestment in Pacific Rim and Agate. He was not quite sure when he first subscribed for\n\nshares in Pacific Rim but thought it was probably in early 1996 and that there had been\n\nvarious stages of subscription during that year. When asked how many shares he had\n\nsubscribed for he said that when he put in his money as capital he did not know what kind\n\nof shares he would get. All he knew was that he, Mr Khoo and Madam Ooi would be equal\n\nshareholders. Altogether he put in about US$120,000 as his share of the capital. However,\n\nno shares were issued to him in 1996. When asked about his loan to Pacific Rim, Mr Soh was\n\nalso vague. He remembered making a loan of US$25,000 but could not remember whether the\n\nmoney had been lent to Agate or to Pacific Rim.74. A letter from Accel to Mr Soh dated 14 July 1997 mentioned that Mr\n\nSoh’s holding of 969,850 shares (share certificate R45) was to be transferred to a\n\ncorporate entity and asked for certain documents to be furnished in that respect. In\n\ncross-examination, Mr Soh was asked whether he had had 969,850 shares in Pacific Rim in\n\nJuly 1997. His answer was ‘Yes’. He was not, however, sure whether that number\n\nof shares included the shares to be transferred to Madam Jamilah. Nor did he know when the\n\nshare certificate R45 had been issued. All he knew was that by 1998 he had a share\n\ncertificate for 969,850 shares in his hands.75. Mr Soh’s understanding was that the assets of Pacific Rim\n\ncomprised its holding of Agate shares. He admitted that he did not have detailed knowledge\n\nof the assets of Pacific Rim and could not remember whether or not Pacific Rim had owned\n\n4.5 million Agate shares in 1996. He knew his U$120,000 had been used to purchase Agate\n\nshares by Pacific Rim some time in 1996 and also that Madam Jamilah was to invest about\n\nUS$500,000 in Pacific Rim. Mr Soh was aware that Madam Jamilah’s investment required\n\nexisting shareholders to sell part of their shares to Madam Jamilah but said that\n\nconcerning himself there was no direct arrangement for him to sell his shares to Madam\n\nJamilah. He had given Madam Ooi the full authorisation to agree, on his behalf, to Madam\n\nJamilah’s investment in Pacific Rim and in 1997, he had sold a portion of his shares\n\nto Madam Jamilah for about US$100,000.",
        "(iii) Mr Stephen M. Wurzburg": "76. Mr Wurzburg gave evidence on what had transpired after the\n\nplaintiff learnt that what should have been its share certificate had in fact been issued\n\nin favour of Madam Jamilah. Acting for Madam Ooi and Agate, he had dealt with one Mike\n\nAllardice of Accel. It was Mr Allardice’s recommendation that in order for Pacific\n\nRim to reissue the share certificate in the name of the plaintiff, Madam Jamilah, her\n\nhusband and the plaintiff, sign an instruction and indemnity letter that he had drafted.\n\nThis letter contained an undertaking on the part of Madam Jamilah, Mr Amin and the\n\nplaintiff to ‘indemnify [Pacific Rim] and all [its] officers past, present and future\n\nand to keep [Pacific Rim] and all such officers indemnified against all claims, demands,\n\nliabilities, costs and expenses for which [Pacific Rim] or [its officers] may become\n\nliable for acting upon our request’. Mr Wurzburg informed Madam Jamilah that he had\n\nan undated share certificate in favour of Just Gems Inc in his hands and would release it\n\nin return for the duly executed indemnity.77. Madam Jamilah employed one William Gould as her counsel and there\n\nwere various attempts to settle the matter between Mr Gould and Mr Wurzburg. Mr Gould\n\nultimately indicated that Madam Jamilah wished to sell her shares. Agate offered to\n\nattempt to find a buyer for the shares at cost and requested an option to buy them itself\n\nat cost. That offer was rejected and little happened for the next few months.78. At the end of October and in early November 1998, Mr Wurzburg\n\nreceived letters from Madam Jamilah requesting the share certificate in the\n\nplaintiff’s name. He called Mr Gould as he could not respond directly to Madam\n\nJamilah since she was legally represented. Mr Wurzburg confirmed to Mr Gould that he still\n\npossessed the undated share certificate in the name of Just Gems Inc and said he would\n\nwork on revising the Allardice draft indemnity. Mr Wurzburg testified that he believed\n\nthat he had then revised the indemnity and faxed it to Mr Gould although he could find no\n\nrecord of having done so.79. Instead of Mr Wurzburg hearing back from Mr Gould, Madam Ooi\n\nreceived a letter on 26 November 1998 from the plaintiff’s Singapore lawyers asking\n\nfor refund of US$550,000. On 10 December 1998 Mr Wurzburg wrote to these lawyers offering,\n\nin exchange for the plaintiff’s shares in both Agate and Pacific Rim, to refund\n\nUS$550,000 to the plaintiff. On 23 December 1998, the plaintiff’s Singapore lawyers\n\nstated that the plaintiff could not accept the proposed terms of settlement and asked\n\nwhether Mr Wurzburg had instructions to accept service on behalf of Madam Ooi. Mr Wurzburg\n\nreplied on 6 January 1999 stating that his client would refund US$595,002.50 (US$500,000\n\nfor the Pacific Rim shares and US$95,002.50 for the Agate shares). He also reiterated that\n\nthe Pacific Rim share certificate would be released once the indemnity letter had been\n\nsigned by Madam Jamilah and Mr Amin. Subsequently, the parties began settlement\n\ndiscussions through a mediator but these were not successful.Findings",
        "Issue (1)": "What payments did Mr Amin make?80. It is a part of the Plaintiff’s case on the agreement that it\n\nwas concluded in August 1996 or, at least, prior to the payment by Mr Amin of the sum of\n\nUS$200,000 to Madam Ooi in September 1996. The plaintiff says that this payment was the\n\nfirst instalment of its investment in Pacific Rim and that it was because of Madam\n\nJamilah’s anxiety over the lack of paperwork to support the spending of such a large\n\namount that the memorandum of 25 September was produced. Madam Ooi’s position on the\n\nother hand is that the payment had nothing to do with the plaintiff’s investment in\n\nPacific Rim. If Madam Ooi’s case on this is accepted, the strength of the\n\nplaintiff’s case overall would be much reduced. In addition the plaintiff would be\n\nunable to establish that it had paid US$550,000 in total. It is therefore important to\n\ndecide whether the plaintiff paid US$200,000 to Madam Ooi in September 1996 on account of\n\nthe investment before going on to consider what contract was arrived at and between whom.81. Mr Amin’s evidence was that he instructed Coutts on 16\n\nSeptember 1996 to transfer from the account of Parmoor the sum of US$200,000 to Citibank\n\nSingapore for account of Madam Ooi. He produced a copy of his letter of that date to the\n\nbank indicating Madam Ooi as the payee and giving her account number as A/C 0116316005. He\n\nalso produced a debit advice from Coutts dated 17 September 1996 showing that it had\n\ndebited Parmoor’s account with the sum of US$200,036.70 in respect of US$200,000\n\nremitted to Madam Ooi and a further US$36.70 as its charge for this remittance. The third\n\nsupporting document that Mr Amin produced was a copy of Parmoor’s bank statement from\n\nCoutts for the period July to September 1996 and this showed the debit of the sum of\n\nUS$200,036.70 on 17 September 1996.82. The account number of Madam Ooi that Mr Amin specified in his\n\nletter of instruction was her ‘Maxisave’ account. This was an account\n\ndenominated in Singapore dollars whereas the remittance was denominated in US dollars. Ms\n\nCatherine Tan, the Citibank officer, testified that if monies were sent by a third party\n\nto a specified account in Citibank and that account was denominated in Singapore dollars\n\nwhereas the remittance was in US dollars, then if the amount was substantial the bank\n\nwould ask its customer, the holder of the account, how the customer wanted the funds dealt\n\nwith and would follow those instructions. If the remittance was a small amount, they would\n\nconvert it into Singapore dollars and credit the specified account.83. Madam Ooi produced some bank statements issued to her by Citibank.\n\nThe statement covering the month of September 1996 does not show the receipt of the\n\nremittance of US$200,000. Nor does it show the receipt of a Singapore dollar amount\n\nequivalent to US$200,000. In fact there seems to have been only one deposit into the\n\naccount in September and that was the sum of S$5,004.09 deposited on 30 September. In her\n\ndefence, Madam Ooi put the plaintiff to strict proof that payment of US$200,000 was made\n\ninto her Citibank account on or about 16 September 1996 or at all. The implication of that\n\npleading was that she had not received the money. In court however, she did not maintain\n\nthis stand. Instead she admitted that a sum of US$200,000 had been received into Citibank\n\nin her name for the purpose of enabling Mr Amin to take out in cash Malaysian Ringgit of\n\nan amount equivalent to US$190,000. She did not, however, produce any bank statement which\n\nshowed either the receipt of that money on her behalf or the withdrawal of the US$190,000.\n\nNor was there any document showing what had happened to the remaining US$10,000.84. Madam Ooi’s position in relation to the US$200,000 changed\n\nmore than once in the course of the action. Her first position, as stated in her defence,\n\nwas the denial that she had received the sum of US$550,000 and her requiring strict proof\n\nfrom the plaintiff on the remittance of US$200,000 which formed part of that total sum.\n\nWhen it came to the application by the plaintiff for summary judgment, however, Madam Ooi\n\nfiled an affidavit (her first affidavit) in which she admitted that at some time Mr Amin\n\nhad remitted US$200,000 to Citibank Singapore in her name. She explained that this money\n\nhad been sent in her name because Mr Amin wanted to open an account with that bank. As the\n\naccount opening formalities were not completed, he requested that this money be exchanged\n\nfor Malaysian Ringgit which he physically carried with him. She went on to say that the\n\nofficer who attended to this transaction on 19 September 1996 when Mr Amin and herself\n\nvisited the bank was one Ms Nora Saini. This was not the end of the explanation as Madam\n\nOoi continued:‘This payment, like the earlier one referred to in paragraph 10\n\n  hereinabove, related to a different transaction altogether and is separate and distinct\n\n  from the transaction in question in these proceedings, which involve the purchase of\n\n  shares of Pacific Rim. In this respect, I crave leave to refer to copies of the documents\n\n  exhibited and collectively marked as \"SOCL-3\".’In paragraph 10 of the first affidavit, Madam Ooi had been talking\n\nabout the direct investment by the plaintiff in Agate. The documents marked\n\n‘SOCL-3’ were documents relating to a direct investment in Agate by Parmoor. It\n\ntherefore appeared from the first affidavit that Madam Ooi was connecting the remittance\n\nof US$200,000 to Parmoor’s investment in Agate.85. In her affidavit of evidence-in-chief (her second affidavit), Madam\n\nOoi modified her stand by deleting all references to Parmoor’s investment in Agate\n\nand contented herself with repeating the assertion that the US$200,000 was sent to her so\n\nthat Mr Amin could open an account in Citibank. Naturally, she was cross-examined at\n\nlength on the change in her position. Her initial response was that her stand at the Order\n\n14 proceedings had been identical to the stand taken in her second affidavit. She\n\nadmitted, in a roundabout fashion, that the September payment had been the only time when\n\nthe US$200,000 had been sent to her account. She conceded subsequently that it seemed from\n\nher first affidavit as if it had been her assertion that the US$200,000 paid in September\n\n1996 related to the Parmoor investment in Agate. She said next that the US$200,000 was a\n\ntransaction that was distinct and separate both from the subscription for Agate shares by\n\nParmoor and the subscription for shares in Pacific Rim by the plaintiff. She then conceded\n\nthat it did appear from the first affidavit that there had been some confusion in the\n\ndocumentation attached to that affidavit but asserted that she had clarified the position\n\nin her second affidavit. As far as the first affidavit was concerned, she said: \"I\n\ndon’t know why the Parmoor shares were attached here. I may have been confused at\n\nthat time. There is no doubt that when I did my second affidavit I was very clear how the\n\ntransaction transpired.\"86. The plaintiffs submitted that Madam Ooi had abandoned the stand in\n\nher first affidavit that the US$200,000 was connected with Parmoor’s investment in\n\nAgate because Madam Jamilah had, in a subsequent affidavit filed in the Order 14\n\nproceedings, demolished that assertion by exhibiting the evidence of the payments for the\n\nParmoor’s investment which had all been made in 1997 and not in September 1996. There\n\nis some force in that submission since Madam Ooi was unable to give a rational explanation\n\nas to why she had brought up the Parmoor investment in connection with the US$200,000 and\n\ncould only state weakly that she had been confused. Madam Ooi herself was compelled to\n\nadmit that the change in her stand between the filing of the first affidavit and that of\n\nthe second had taken place because the original position was no longer tenable.87. There are other ways in which Madam Ooi’s evidence on the\n\nUS$200,000 was unsatisfactory. First, she was wrong on the date on which Mr Amin was in\n\nSingapore. She had stated categorically on two occasions that Mr Amin was here on 19\n\nSeptember 1996. This assertion was demonstrated to be wrong by the production of Mr\n\nAmin’s passport which established that he was not in Singapore on 19 September but\n\nwas here only on 20 September. Further, Ms Catherine Tan produced evidence showing that Mr\n\nAmin had opened an account with Citibank Singapore on 20 September 1996 and not on 19\n\nSeptember 1996. When Madam Ooi was confronted with this evidence while she was on the\n\nwitness stand, she said that she stood by the assertion that: ‘On or about 19/9 i.e.\n\nbetween 16/9 and 20/9 he was in Singapore.’ She then said that it had been a long\n\ntime ago and she could not remember the exact date. I also noted that the opening of the\n\naccount was completed on 20 September and thus, contrary to Madam Ooi’s assertion, Mr\n\nAmin would not have had to take away money in cash simply because the formalities were\n\nincomplete.88. Secondly, Madam Ooi did not call Ms Nora Saini to testify on her\n\nbehalf. This lady was handling Madam Ooi’s account at Citibank Singapore at all\n\nmaterial times and she was the one who was supposed to have attended to the transaction in\n\nwhich US$190,000 was withdrawn by Madam Ooi, converted into Ringgit and handed to Mr Amin.\n\nMadam Ooi admitted on the stand that since the sum of US$200,000 had been remitted to her\n\naccount and she was the named beneficiary of the remittance, she was the only person who\n\ncould direct Citibank as to what to do with the money. She agreed that if she had\n\ninstructed Ms Nora Saini to take out US$190,000 from that remittance and not deposit the\n\nsame into the account, Ms Saini would have done so and that such an instruction would have\n\nbeen evidenced by a Citibank form filled up and signed by Madam Ooi. When asked where that\n\nwritten instruction was, Madam Ooi’s reply was it was with the bank and that she had\n\nnot kept a copy of it.89. Madam Ooi did not mention in either of her affidavits what had\n\nhappened to the remaining US$10,000. On the stand, she filled in this lacuna by saying\n\nthat part of the remittance had been credited to the new account which Mr Amin established\n\nwith Citibank during their visit that day as the initial deposit on the new account. She\n\nagreed that there must have been a written confirmation from her addressed to the bank\n\ninstructing it to transfer US$10,000 to Mr Amin’s new account. She asserted this\n\ndocument was with the bank as well. There was some confusion as to how much exactly Mr\n\nAmin had deposited in his new account (his statement showed an initial deposit of\n\nUS$5,000) and later in the cross-examination, Madam Ooi asserted that US$5,000 had been\n\ndeposited into the account and US$5,000 must have been taken out in cash. She surmised\n\nthat she must have given a written instruction to Citibank to allow that withdrawal as\n\nwell though she could not remember what exactly had happened. All the gaps in Madam\n\nOoi’s evidence in relation to the US$200,000 could have been filled if Ms Saini had\n\nbeen called. The omission to call her and the failure to produce other account documents\n\nthat must have been generated in relation to the receipt and disposal of this US$200,000\n\nincluding instructions given to Citibank, are, in my view, telling.90. I do not accept Madam Ooi’s explanation in relation to the use\n\nof the US$200,000. Having admitted receipt of the money (the remittance of which was more\n\nthan adequately established by Mr Amin) the onus lay on her to show that it was received\n\nfor a purpose that had nothing to do with the investment in Pacific Rim. Her explanations\n\nwere inconsistent and not backed up by any documentation or any independent witness. At an\n\nearly stage, she tried to fudge the issue by connecting this payment with the Parmoor\n\ninvestment. Having been forced to abandon that assertion, she was not able to bolster her\n\nalternative position with convincing evidence. I therefore find that Madam Ooi received\n\nUS$200,000 on or about 17 September 1996 as a part payment for the plaintiff’s\n\ninvestment in Pacific Rim.91. Madam Ooi did not dispute receipt of the sum of US$250,000 on 6\n\nNovember 1996 and the sum of US$100,000 on 20 November 1996. Since I have found that she\n\nalso received the US$200,000, the result is that I find that in total she was paid the sum\n\nof US$550,000 on account of the plaintiff’s investment in shares of Pacific Rim.92. In coming to the above findings, I am cognisant that in\n\ncorrespondence sent in December 1996, Mr Amin stated that he had only paid US$450,000 up\n\nto the date of his letter. Mr Amin’s explanation was that he was confused when he\n\nwrote that letter since he had made many payments to Madam Ooi for various investments and\n\nshe was always asking him for more money. It was only when his wife went through the\n\npayments in 1998 that she discovered the overpayment. I accept Mr Amin’s explanation.\n\nIt is a reasonable one given the circumstances then existing.93. I am also influenced by the fact that Madam Ooi was unable to\n\nestablish her assertion that the full purchase price of US$500,000 had been paid in four\n\ninstalments in the amounts of, respectively US$250,000, US$100,000, US$100,000 and\n\nUS$50,000. The last two payments were allegedly made in cash. Mr Amin denied having made\n\nthe payment of US$100,000. Since Madam Ooi alleged this payment had been made she had the\n\nonus of proof on this issue. She was not able to discharge it. The money was purportedly\n\nreceived by Ms Sim but Ms Sim was not called to testify on the matter. Further, Madam\n\nOoi’s bank statement did not show a deposit of US$100,000 on the day in question and\n\nas I have stated in 51 above Madam Ooi’s attempt to equate a deposit of US$99,500\n\nwith the US$100,000 purportedly received was not convincing. Madam Ooi’s inability to\n\nsubstantiate the US$100,000 payment put a substantial dent in the credibility of her\n\nversion of how the purchase price was settled.94. Mr Amin admitted making the payment of US$50,000 in cash to Mr Khoo\n\nbut said that he had not included this amount in the calculations as he did not have proof\n\nof the payment. If I accept Madam Ooi’s testimony that this money was received on\n\naccount of the Pacific Rim share purchase by the plaintiff, I would have to find that the\n\nplaintiff had overpaid Madam Ooi by US$100,000. Since, however, the plaintiff is not\n\nclaiming reimbursement in the sum of US$100,000, I need not deal further with this\n\npayment.",
        "Issue (2) What agreement was arrived at and between whom?": "95. As the plaintiff pointed out in its closing submissions, the\n\nparties do not agree on the nature of the agreement to purchase shares in Pacific Rim. In\n\nparticular, they are at odds on when the agreement was made, who the parties to the\n\ncontract were and the quantum of shares agreed to be purchased and sold. The plaintiff\n\nfurther submitted that for the purpose of succeeding in respect of its claim for monies\n\nhad and received, the matters that are in dispute regarding the agreement are not\n\nrelevant. What is relevant to the cause of action is not in dispute, namely that there was\n\nan agreement between the parties to purchase shares in Pacific Rim and that it was\n\npursuant to this agreement that US$500,000 was to be paid. With respect, I disagree. In\n\norder to determine what, if any, liability Madam Ooi has to the plaintiff, I do need to\n\ndetermine who the agreement was between, what the terms of the agreement were and what\n\neach party was expected to do thereunder.96. It was submitted that Madam Ooi’s position on this issue is\n\nstraightforward. As the SPA clearly stated, the agreement for the sale and purchase of the\n\nshares was made between the plaintiff as purchaser and the shareholders of Pacific Rim as\n\nvendors. Madam Jamilah signed the SPA in her capacity as representative of the plaintiff.\n\nLikewise, Madam Ooi signed the SPA in her capacity as the representative of the\n\nshareholders of Pacific Rim.97. The above submission did not deal adequately with the wording and\n\nimplications of the SPA. First, it should be noted that Madam Ooi was not only a\n\nrepresentative of shareholders of Pacific Rim but also a shareholder of that company in\n\nher own right. Secondly, as can be seen from 23 above, the SPA made no attempt to\n\ndistinguish between and separate the sales made by each of the shareholders. The\n\nshareholders were not identified separately nor was the number of shares each individual\n\nshareholder was supposed to sell indicated. Instead, there was a joint agreement by the\n\nshareholders of Pacific Rim ‘To sell and deliver to the Purchaser One Hundred Twenty\n\nThousand and Five (124,005) of its US$1 par value common stock’. This meant that each\n\nof the shareholders had an obligation to ensure that the plaintiff received those shares.\n\nMadam Ooi as one of the shareholders was equally obliged. Thus, even if the only agreement\n\nthat existed in relation to the sale of the shares was the SPA, Madam Ooi’s role\n\nunder it was not simply to receive the purchase monies on behalf of the shareholders. She\n\nwas obliged to ensure that the plaintiff received 124,005 shares in Pacific Rim.98. I cannot find that the SPA was the sole contract existing in this\n\ncase. As an entire agreement, it leaves a lot to be desired. There is no indication of any\n\ntime limit either for payment or for delivery and such inadequacies would imply that these\n\nmatters had been agreed separately as Madam Jamilah averred. The evidence points to the\n\nconclusion that the SPA was ancillary to the main contract which was a contract between\n\nthe plaintiff and Madam Ooi.99. It appeared clearly from the evidence that Madam Ooi was the person\n\nwho instigated the chain of events leading to the purchase of the Pacific Rim shares. She\n\nwas a prime mover of both Pacific Rim and Agate and in mid 1996, Agate was in urgent need\n\nof funds. She therefore contacted her old friend Madam Jamilah to persuade her to invest\n\nin Agate and Pacific Rim. She was successful in both attempts. The direct investment in\n\nAgate went through first and smoothly and, in the meantime, the parties had many telephone\n\ndiscussions about an investment in Pacific Rim.100. I find that the result of these discussions was that there was an\n\nagreement between Pacific Rim (a company incorporated at Madam Ooi’s suggestion and\n\nwith her help – it was even she who came up with the name ‘Just Gems’) and\n\nMadam Ooi in either late August or early September 1996. This agreement was evidenced by\n\nthe payment of US$200,000 made by Mr Amin on behalf of the plaintiff, the memorandum of 25\n\nSeptember (which even Madam Ooi, who professed at first to have no knowledge of it, later\n\naccepted as reflecting some of the terms of the agreement with the plaintiff), and the SPA\n\nitself. The agreement was that the plaintiff would invest US$500,000 in Pacific Rim in\n\norder to obtain a 22% interest in that company and that this money would be paid in\n\ninstalments to Madam Ooi who would do everything necessary to ensure that the plaintiff\n\nbecame a 22% shareholder of Pacific Rim. The intentions of the parties were reflected not\n\nonly in the memorandum which was prepared by Madam Ooi subsequently but also in documents\n\nprepared by Agate in November and December 1996. In view of this finding on the\n\ncontractual relationship between Madam Ooi and the plaintiff, it follows that all payments\n\nthat were made to Madam Ooi or into her bank account were made for her account and in\n\nrelation to that contract. Those payments were not made to the account of the shareholders\n\nof Pacific Rim in general. What Madam Ooi did with the money after she received it and in\n\nwhat proportions she distributed it amongst herself and the other shareholders was her\n\nbusiness and had nothing to do, in contractual terms, with the contract between her and\n\nthe plaintiff.101. Madam Jamilah fixed the time of the discussions and agreement\n\naround August 1996. Madam Ooi was vague and evasive on timing. The closest she could come\n\nto an exact approximation was to say that the discussions took place in the second half of\n\nthe year. Notwithstanding that the memorandum that she eventually admitted to have\n\nauthored stated that the figure to be invested in Pacific Rim was US$500,000, she refused\n\nto confirm that the figure had been agreed during the telephone discussions but asserted\n\ninstead that it was finalised ‘through the Stock Purchase Agreement’. That would\n\nmean that the purchase price was not agreed prior to 1 November 1996 when the SPA was sent\n\nto Madam Jamilah. That assertion was contrary to the contents of the memorandum. Mr\n\nKhoo’s evidence also contradicted the position that the SPA was the document that\n\nfinalised matters. He was clear in his own mind that the agreement was concluded prior to\n\nthe SPA and the SPA’s function was to evidence the concluded agreement.102. I found Madam Ooi to be an unsatisfactory witness in many areas,\n\nsome of which have already been noted. She was particularly unsatisfactory in relation to\n\nthe preparation and meaning of the memorandum. As noted, at first she claimed that she\n\ncould not remember even preparing it but on the stand she admitted that she had. Even\n\nthen, she claimed that she could not remember what the contents of the memorandum meant.\n\nMadam Ooi could not remember either when or even where the meeting took place. On further\n\nquestioning she claimed that the purpose of the memorandum was to discuss possible\n\n‘what if’ scenarios and what Madam Jamilah’s position would be based on\n\nsuch scenarios. She claimed that the figures stated therein were not accurate or true but\n\nsimply estimations. However, when asked in cross-examination whether the memorandum\n\nreflected what Madam Jamilah’s position would be in those ‘what if’\n\nscenarios, she admitted that it had not. I note that Mr Khoo was equally evasive and\n\nunforthcoming on the question of the memorandum and the meeting until he was forced to\n\nadmit during cross-examination that there had been a meeting between Madam Jamilah, Madam\n\nOoi and himself and that he had done some scribbling at the back of the memorandum though\n\nof course he was quick to assert that that writing did not reflect any agreed terms.103. It was clear from the evidence of Mr Khoo and Mr Soh that Madam\n\nOoi had carte blanche from them to do whatever she wished with their shares in order to\n\nraise capital for Pacific Rim and Agate. It no doubt helped that her actions also resulted\n\nin a quick profit for both of them. Mr Soh, for example, invested only US$120,000 in\n\nPacific Rim in 1996 but claimed that in 1997 he was paid US$100,000 for 20% of his\n\noriginal investment. Since Madam Ooi had the ability to deal with Pacific Rim and its\n\nshares as she saw fit, it was entirely reasonable for her to agree with the plaintiff to\n\ngive that company a 22% interest in Pacific Rim notwithstanding that she herself did not\n\nown all the shares necessary to transfer that interest to the plaintiff.104. Madam Ooi asserted that the SPA was the only contract that existed\n\nand that it was an agreement by the shareholders of Pacific Rim to sell the plaintiff a\n\n20% share in Pacific Rim. In my judgment, the SPA was not a separate contract between the\n\nshareholders of Pacific Rim and the plaintiff. It was simply a document generated by Madam\n\nOoi who thought she needed it to give effect to the agreement which already existed\n\nbetween her and the plaintiff. The plaintiff had already agreed to acquire a 22% interest\n\nin Pacific Rim from or through Madam Ooi. It would have been incompatible with that\n\ncontract for the plaintiff to enter into a separate agreement with the shareholders\n\ngenerally for the purchase of the same, or almost the same, interest. In my opinion, the\n\nSPA had no legal effect. At the most, it could have evidenced a variation in the agreement\n\nbetween the plaintiff and Madam Ooi whereby the plaintiff agreed to reduce the interest it\n\nwas purchasing from 22% to 20%. Such a variation was, however, inconsistent with the\n\nstatements made by Agate as to the 22% interest which the plaintiff had in Pacific Rim.\n\nNor was it supported by fresh consideration. All I can conclude is that the paperwork was\n\nextremely shoddy and, since it was generated by Madam Ooi and/or her attorneys and\n\nemployees, if there is any doubt as to what occurred, that doubt must be resolved in\n\nfavour of the plaintiff. I therefore hold that the original contract whereby in return for\n\nan investment of US$500,000 the plaintiff would acquire a 22% interest in Pacific Rim\n\nremained unmodified despite the signing of the SPA.105. Madam Ooi, in trying to support her assertion that the SPA was the\n\ncontract, produced what she said was a letter of authorisation from the shareholders\n\ngiving her a mandate to deal with their shares on their behalf. The plaintiff submitted\n\nthat this authorisation was clearly an after-thought and ought to be rejected. First, it\n\nwas dated 1 November 1996 and by then the agreement had already been made. Secondly, only\n\nMr Soh ever signed the authorisation. There was no evidence that the other shareholders\n\nhad even seen it let alone signed it. Thirdly it was inconsistent with Mr Khoo’s\n\nassertion that he was negotiating with the plaintiff on his own behalf when he spoke to\n\nMadam Jamilah. Yet Mr Khoo’s name (though not his signature) appeared on the same\n\ndocument. Fourthly, Ms Sim’s name was omitted from the document altogether for some\n\nunexplained reason. I accept the foregoing submissions. There was no evidence that the\n\nletter of authorisation actually existed let alone was signed by any of the shareholders\n\non 1 November 1996.106. Another piece of evidence which casts doubt on the legal effect of\n\nthe SPA as a contract relates to the issued shareholding of Pacific Rim at that time. It\n\nwould be recalled that under the SPA, the shareholders purportedly undertook to sell to\n\nthe plaintiff 124,005 of the common stock of Pacific Rim and represented that this share\n\npurchase would represent a 20% ownership interest in Pacific Rim. In November 1996,\n\nhowever, 124,005 shares in Pacific Rim would not have given the plaintiff a 20% share in\n\nthe company.107. Up to 8 January 1997, Pacific Rim had a share capital of only\n\n420,003 shares. Thus, in November 1996, 124,005 shares was equal to a 29.52% interest in\n\nthe capital. For 124,005 shares to represent a 20% interest, the share capital would have\n\nhad to consist of 620,003 shares. Both Madam Ooi and Mr Khoo admitted in court that in\n\nNovember 1996, Pacific Rim had not issued even 620,000 shares.108. Madam Ooi attempted to get around this discrepancy by claiming\n\nthat in their calculations she and Mr Khoo had taken into account outstanding\n\nshareholders’ loans totalling US$200,000. Capitalisation of the loans would have\n\nincreased the share capital to 620,003 shares. She did not, however, produce any evidence\n\nto show that such loans existed. Mr Soh was asked whether he had lent money to Pacific Rim\n\nand, although he remembered having made a loan of US$25,000, he could not remember if that\n\nhad been to Pacific Rim. Even if he had, on the basis of his evidence that he, Madam Ooi\n\nand Mr Khoo had invested roughly equal amounts in Pacific Rim (this was substantiated by\n\nthe fact that each of them transferred an equal number of shares to Madam Jamilah) and the\n\nloan made by him was in the amount of US$25,000, a total amount lent to the company by its\n\nthree main shareholders would not have exceeded US$100,000 and the minority shareholders,\n\nwho between them held only 20% of the issued capital, could not have lent the company more\n\nthan US$20,000. This was because it was not contemplated that capitalisation of the loans\n\nwould change the proportions of shares held by the existing shareholders. Since the number\n\nof shares to be transferred to the plaintiff pursuant to the SPA was not equivalent to a\n\n20% interest of the company as at November 1996, the SPA cannot have been intended to have\n\nimmediate legal effect. Otherwise the shareholders would have been obliged to give the\n\nplaintiff a 29% interest, something they did not intend to do.109. There is no dispute that no share certificate for a number of\n\nshares which would give the plaintiff a 22% interest in Pacific Rim has ever been issued\n\nand delivered to the plaintiff. There is an undated share certificate in the name of\n\n‘Just Gems Inc’ for a number of shares equivalent to a 20% interest in Pacific\n\nRim but there is no evidence that this share certificate has legal effect. As stated, it\n\nis undated and nothing has been produced which would indicate that despite the failure to\n\ndate the share certificate, the plaintiff whether called by its proper name or by the name\n\nof ‘Just Gems Inc’ appears in the register of Pacific Rim as the holder of the\n\nnumber of shares stated in the certificate. I must therefore hold that Madam Ooi has not\n\nfulfilled her obligation under the contract which was to procure that in return for the\n\ninvestment of US$500,000, the plaintiff would acquire a 22% interest in Pacific Rim.110. I should state here that I accept the evidence that Madam Jamilah\n\nsigned the six instruments of transfer. Mr Soh’s evidence on this point struck me as\n\nstraightforward and truthful. Madam Jamilah was not as truthful on this point as she could\n\nhave been. She did admit signing six documents but refused to accept that they could have\n\nbeen instruments of transfer. This denial was undermined by the contents of the memorandum\n\nshe made in July 1997 at about the time of the signing of the six documents. The figures\n\nthat she wrote down in the memorandum corresponded with the number of shares being\n\ntransferred by each of the shareholders in the respective instruments of transfer.\n\nAlthough Madam Jamilah signed those instruments her action would not excuse Madam\n\nOoi’s breach of contract. Madam Ooi was instrumental in the way in which the\n\ntransfers were drafted and she accepted responsibility for this, quite rightly, in March\n\n1998. Having done so, if she had corrected the situation immediately, the present action\n\nwould never have arisen.",
        "Issue (3) Was the eventual non-transfer of the shares to the plaintiff due to any default\n\nor omission on the part of the plaintiff?": "111. In the amended defence, Madam Ooi pleaded that the non-transfer of\n\nthe shares was due to the default, omission and/or refusal on the part of the plaintiff\n\nand its representatives to do what was necessary to regularise the erroneous registration\n\nof the shares in Madam Jamilah’s name. The crux of this was the failure and/or\n\nrefusal of the plaintiff and Madam Jamilah and Mr Amin to sign the indemnity agreement\n\ndrafted by Mr Allardice.112. At trial, Madam Ooi admitted that the erroneous registration of\n\nMadam Jamilah as the holder of the shares which should have been in the plaintiff’s\n\nname was her fault. She admitted that it was her mistake that resulted in the share\n\ncertificate issued by Agate naming the shareholder as ‘Just Gems Inc’ and it was\n\nalso her mistake that the Pacific Rim share certificate was issued in Madam Jamilah’s\n\nname. She further admitted that she had sought the indemnity agreement from the plaintiff\n\nto protect herself from the consequences of her mistake.113. In these circumstances, it was not correct for Pacific Rim to\n\ninsist on the indemnity agreement being signed by the plaintiff, Madam Jamilah and Mr Amin\n\nand Madam Ooi had the power to cause Pacific Rim to withdraw that insistence. It would be\n\nnoted that under the indemnity agreement, the indemnifiers were to indemnify all officers\n\nof Pacific Rim, past, present and future and to see such officers indemnified against all\n\nclaims, demands, liabilities, costs and expenses arising out of the company acting on\n\ntheir request to cancel the share certificate in the name of Madam Jamilah and reissue it\n\nin the name of the plaintiff. This was a highly unreasonable requirement since the\n\nnecessity for the cancellation and reissue of the certificate was a mistake made by a\n\ndirector of Pacific Rim. In any case it was wrong to require Mr Amin to give an indemnity\n\nsince he was a third party in relation to the mistake that had been made.114. There was also a submission that the situation could have been\n\nresolved had Madam Jamilah herself executed, as transferee, an instrument of transfer,\n\nwhereby she transferred the shares in question to the plaintiff, as transferee. Madam\n\nJamilah refused to do this. I do not find this refusal to be unreasonable. Madam\n\nJamilah’s position was that she herself was not supposed to be a shareholder of\n\nPacific Rim. By signing such an instrument as transferee she would have accepted that for\n\nsome time and for whatever reason she had held shares in Pacific Rim. Such an acceptance\n\nmay very well have had other consequences for her. I cannot fault her refusal to put\n\nherself in what would have been an incorrect position.115. There were settlement negotiations between the parties. Mr Khoo in\n\nthe course of his evidence agreed that Madam Jamilah was asked as part of the settlement\n\nnegotiations to agree not to sue and that in 1998 and 1999 she and Mr Amin were asked a\n\nfew times to indemnify the officers of Agate past, present and future against all claims,\n\ndemands, liabilities, costs and expenses. In May 1999, one Mr Ong had been enlisted to\n\nassist in settling the dispute between the parties and in the course of settlement\n\nprocess, a settlement document was sent to Madam Jamilah. This document was signed by Mr\n\nKhoo and contained among other things an indemnity in relation to the shareholding in\n\nPacific Rim. Madam Jamilah’s position was that she was prepared to agree to part of\n\nthe indemnity but would not accept that paragraph indemnifying all the officers of Pacific\n\nRim against claims etc for which they or the company might become liable. Mr Khoo did not\n\nadmit that Madam Jamilah had agreed to a modified form of indemnity but, on the evidence,\n\nit appears to me that she did and it was Madam Ooi and Mr Khoo who dug their heels in at\n\nthis point.116. In the light of the evidence, I find that the plaintiff did not\n\nact unreasonably in refusing to sign the indemnity. I further find that the failure to\n\nregister the plaintiff as a shareholder of Pacific Rim is not due to the default of the\n\nplaintiff or of Madam Jamilah.",
        "Issue (4) What remedy is the plaintiff entitled to?": "117. The plaintiff no longer wants to be a shareholder in Pacific Rim.\n\nIt wants its money back with interest. It also wants a declaration that neither it nor\n\nMadam Jamilah has ever been a shareholder in Pacific Rim. In any case, the plaintiff is\n\nentitled to the return of the US$50,000 which it overpaid Madam Ooi. She has no basis to\n\nhold on to this money which was paid to her under a mistake of fact by the plaintiff, the\n\nmistake being due to a wrong calculation of the amounts paid to Madam Ooi prior to 20\n\nNovember 1996. On that date, the plaintiff should have paid Madam Ooi US$50,000 instead of\n\nthe US$100,000 remitted.118. As regards the US$500,000 which was paid for the shares, the\n\nplaintiff’s contention is that it is entitled to get this money back from Madam Ooi\n\neither on the basis of money had and received for a particular purpose or due to a total\n\nfailure of consideration. Madam Ooi’s basic position was that she had received the\n\nmoney for the account of the shareholders of the second defendant and in her capacity as\n\nagent for these shareholders. As such, any liability to repay the money would rest on the\n\nprincipals and not on Madam Ooi, the agent.119. I have found that Madam Ooi was a party to a contract with the\n\nplaintiff. She received this money under the contract and she received this money as\n\nprincipal and not as agent. Madam Ooi’s first line of defence therefore fails.120. As regards the claim for money had and received, Madam Ooi’s\n\nstand is that she did not receive the money for the use of the plaintiff or under any\n\ncircumstances as would entitle the plaintiff to recover it from her. The classic case of\n\nan action for money had and received arises, as stated inHalsbury’s Laws of\n\nEngland(4thEd) Vol 9(1), para 1138 when D has received money from X for\n\nthe purposes of paying it over to P or where D has in his hands money belonging to X and\n\nis subsequently instructed by X to pay it over to P. In these circumstances P can maintain\n\nan action against D for money had and received. It can be seen that in this situation the\n\nplaintiff and the defendant are not in a direct contractual relationship but that the\n\ndefendant has to account to the plaintiff for money received from a third party. This\n\nsituation does not apply in this case as Madam Ooi and the plaintiff had a contractual\n\nrelationship under which the plaintiff paid money, albeit through a third party, to Madam\n\nOoi in consideration of her procuring the plaintiff shares in Pacific Rim. The plaintiff\n\nwas not really concerned whether the money was paid to the shareholders or to the company\n\nas long as it received its shares.121. In my view, the plaintiff can only recover the monies paid if it\n\ncan establish that there has been a total failure of consideration. As stated inChitty\n\non Contracts(28thEd) Vol 1 para 30-048, where money has been paid under a\n\ntransaction that is or becomes ineffective, the payer may recover the money provided the\n\nconsideration for the payment has totally failed. A failure of consideration occurs where\n\nthe payer has not enjoyed the benefit of any part of what he bargained for.122. The question here is whether the plaintiff has enjoyed any benefit\n\nfrom its bargain to invest in Pacific Rim shares. It should be noted that it has not\n\nreceived any dividends nor has it taken part in the operations, such as they are, of\n\nPacific Rim. At one stage, Mr Amin made a suggestion that Madam Jamilah as the\n\nrepresentative of the plaintiff should be appointed to the board of Pacific Rim. This\n\nsuggestion was not taken up by Madam Ooi or Mr Khoo. Mr Khoo said it was not part of the\n\nagreement. If the plaintiff had been a shareholder, however, it could have called for a\n\nshareholders’ meeting and proposed Madam Jamilah’s appointment although it might\n\nnot have been able to have its proposal passed. As a shareholder the plaintiff could have\n\nattended general meetings of Pacific Rim and asked for the convening of extraordinary\n\ngeneral meetings. It would also be entitled to participate in a distribution of the\n\ncompany’s assets on a winding-up.123. It is no doubt true that after the plaintiff’s investment was\n\nmade, it was declared to be a shareholder of Pacific Rim in several documents issued by\n\nAgate. Such advertisement would not, however, constitute in my view the benefit bargained\n\nfor. Nor would the role that Madam Jamilah played in Agate’s Malaysian\n\nsubsidiary’s operations nor her appointment to the board of Agate. The plaintiff had\n\na direct investment in Agate which could justify Madam Jamilah’s participation.124. I am satisfied that the plaintiff has not received the benefit it\n\npaid US$500,000 for and that the consideration for the contract has totally failed.\n\nAccordingly, it is entitled to the return of US$500,000.125. As regards the declarations asked for, I think it proper to make a\n\ndeclaration in respect of the plaintiff’s status (actually non-status) vis--vis\n\nPacific Rim. I will not make such a declaration as regards Madam Jamilah’s status as\n\nthere is a share certificate issued in her favour and this may have been recorded in the\n\nshare register book of Pacific Rim. In any case, Madam Jamilah is not a party to this\n\naction.126. The plaintiff has also asked for a declaration that Madam Ooi give\n\nan indemnity to the plaintiff and/or Madam Jamilah and/or Mr Amin if they are made parties\n\nto an action by reason of the fact that they are or were shareholders or officers of\n\nPacific Rim. I do not understand the legal basis of this claim. I will not make such a\n\ndeclaration at this stage but the plaintiff is at liberty to make further arguments on\n\nthis issue if it so desires.Conclusion127. In the result there will be judgment for the plaintiff against the\n\nfirst defendant in the sum of US$550,000. The first defendant shall pay interest on the\n\ntotal sum of US$550,000 at 6% p.a. from the date of the writ. This return of this money\n\nwas first demanded by the plaintiff’s lawyers’ letter of 26 November 1998 but\n\nbecause of negotiations between the parties, the writ was not issued until October 1999.\n\nThat being the case, I think the fairest date for the commencement of interest is the date\n\nof the writ. The plaintiff is also awarded its costs of the action. I would like to hear\n\nthe parties on costs as there was an amendment part way through the trial without which\n\nthe plaintiff would not have succeeded. This may affect the costs to be awarded.128. There will also be a declaration that Just Gems Limited is not and\n\nhas never been a shareholder of Pacific Rim Limited.Sgd:JUDITH PRAKASHJUDGEThis does not merit reporting.Copyright © Government of Singapore."
