        "Unjust benefit to the plaintiff": "Counsel for the defendant placed considerable reliance on the argument that it is impermissible and unjust to use the full weight of a consignment in quantifying the compensation when only a part of the consignment is lost.This argument arises from a fallacy. Article 22(2) sets the limit to the compensation payable. It says that for lost, damaged or delayed cargo, the compensation shall not exceed 250 francs per kilogramme of the package or packages concerned. It does not fix the compensation at 250 francs per kilogramme of the package or packages lost, damaged or delayed.Article 22 does not enable a consignee to recover more than its loss. If a consignee suffered a loss of 1,000 francs as a result of the loss, damage or delay of its goods in a consignment of 50kg, it cannot recover 12,500 francs. The most it can recover is 1,000 francs, and less if the compensation is reduced by limitation. This is evident in the present case. The value of the lost transceivers is US$74,360. The plaintiff limits its claim to $7,635.32, while the defendant contends that it should be limited to $2,974.80. The defendant may argue that the plaintiff`s claim is subject to a lower limitation (if the number of packages is taken as nine), but it is overstating the case to complain that the claim would result in an unjust benefit to the plaintiff.While dealing with this complaint, it should also be noted that the weight of consignment lost, damaged or delayed is not used in the computation under art 22(2)(b) which provides for `the total weight of the package or packages concerned` to be taken into consideration. Where a package is partially lost, damaged or delayed, the total weight of that package is taken into account. If that is unjust, it arises from art 22(2)(b) itself.Counsel for the defendant also argued that the:Plaintiffs` claim is only for part of the cargo ... [T]hey proceeded under art 22(2)(b). If the plaintiffs` claim is for the whole of the cargo, they would have proceeded under art 22(2)(a). It is submitted that they recognise there is a difference between losing the whole cargo and part of the cargo and the two situations must be treated differently.I do not think that it is a correct reading of art 22(2) that sub-art (2)(a) applies to claims for total loss and sub-art (2)(b) applies to claims for partial loss. On my reading, sub-art (2)(a) sets the monetary limit by weight to claims for total as well as partial loss, damage or delay. Sub-article (2)(b) sets out the basis on which monetary limit is to be computed. It states that for partial damage, loss or delay, the total weight of the package concerned is taken into account, but it does not refer to claims arising from total loss, damage or delay in which the total weight  of the package must apply. Put another way, there is a need to refer to claims for partial loss, damage or delay to remove any doubt whether the partial or full weight should apply, but there is no need to refer to total loss, damage or delay where there is no uncertainty over that. Like sub-art (2)(a), it applies to total and partial loss, damage or delay.Counsel for the defendant also citedBland v British Airways Board[1981] 1 Lloyd`s Rep 289where Lord Denning in discussing the Convention held at p 290:Article 22(2)(a) covers the case when thewholeof a person`s baggage is lost. I need not deal with that. But art 22(2)(b) covers the case when onlypartof the baggage is lost. That article says:`In the case of loss, damage or delay ofpartof registered baggage ... the amounts to which the carrier`s liability is limited shall be only the total weight of the package or packages concerned.` [Emphasis supplied.]So it depends on the weight of the \"package concerned\".Compensation depends on the number of kilogrammes you have lost.[Emphasis is added.]I humbly repeat my views on the application of art 22(2). In any event, the effect is the same. As the judge pointed out, the limitation to the carrier`s liability (and the consignee`s entitlement) is set by reference to the weight of the package concerned (not the weight of the lost, damaged or delayed part of the package) whereas the compensation is measured by the weight of the lost, damaged or delayed part thereof. This applies equally to claims for total and partial loss.The plaintiff`s full loss is US$74,360. Its claim under art 22(2) is for $7,635.32. The plaintiff`s claim was properly made on the basis that the consignment was in one package. There is no unjust benefit in the sense that the compensation sought exceeds the loss incurred. The plaintiff`s appeal was allowed for these reasons.Outcome:Appeal allowed.Copyright Â© Government of Singapore."
