        "Application for leave to appeal": "32Subsequently, Candid applied in Originating Summons No 809 of 2006 for leave to appeal against my substantive decision to dismiss the reliefs sought by Candid as the amount of the subject matter in issue was under $250,000. The application was made under s 34(2)(a) of the Supreme Court of Judicature Act (Cap 322, 1999 Rev Ed) (“the SCJA”). 33The grounds on which such leave may be granted have been set out in various cases with some variations which are not important for present purposes. It is sufficient for me to refer to the judgment of Kan Ting Chiu J inEssar Steel Ltd v Bayerische Landesbank[2004] 3 SLR 25where he considered the various cases, expressed his view that the ground in respect of aprima faciecase of error need not be confined to one of law and summarised succinctly the grounds at [27]: When I heard the application for leave, I examined it against the tests for granting leave: (a)Is there aprima facieerror of law or fact? I think the assistant registrar did not make any error of law or fact. He was entitled to exercise his discretion in the way he did. (b)Does the decision touch on a general principle decided for the first time? It may be that this question is decided for the first time, but it does not involve any question of general principle. The issue is peculiar to the particular facts of the case and is not likely to arise in other cases. (c)Does it touch on a question of importance on which further argument and the decision of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage? I do not think that whether the plaintiff should pay standard or indemnity costs is a question of such importance. 34Although the application before Kan J was based on s 34(2)(b) of the SCJA, the principles for granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal under s 34(2) of the SCJA are the same irrespective of which particular sub-clause is relied on. Accordingly, I adopted the grounds set out by Kan J as a useful guide. As an aside, I would mention that I agreed with Kan J’s view that aprima faciecase of error need not be confined to one of law. However, this is subject to the qualifications he mentioned which, for present purposes, are not relevant. 35Candid’s application for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal was supported by one affidavit from Mr Lim Chor Pee, the senior partner of Chor Pee. Mr Lim’s affidavit raised only two grounds,ie: (a)that my decision contained aprima faciecase of error of law; and (b)that my decision concerned a question of importance upon which the determination of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage. 36After referring to the factual background, Mr Lim’s affidavit concluded as follows: 10.The Plaintiffs contention is that they have made no representation which the Defendants have acted upon to their detriment that completion would and must take place on 19 July 2005. Indeed, the Plaintiffs contend that the Defendants had themselves by letter dated 19 July 2005 stated that it would be premature even to complete by 30 August 2005. In any event, the Defendants were not ready, able and willing to complete the matter on 19 July 2005, having regard to the Court of Appeal judgement in[See Hup Seng Tin]. 11.It is respectfully submitted that there is an important conveyancing issue of law that should be decided by the Court of Appeal i.e. whether the parties in a sale and purchase agreement can by a course of conduct agree to a date of completion or be bound to such date when both parties were not ready, able and willing to complete on the said date. 37Whether Candid had made a representation which UOB had acted upon were questions of fact peculiar to the case and not questions of law. As for estoppel, I was referring to estoppel by convention which does not require either party to act upon a state of affairs to his detriment. The doctrine of estoppel by convention is not new. Its application to particular facts is not of such importance which would make it in the interest of the public to secure a ruling of the Court of Appeal thereon. 38As regards D&N’s letter dated 19 July 2005, that was a matter of interpretation based on the background facts. It was clearly not a case of aprima facieerror of fact, let alone one of law.A fortiori, it was also not a decision on a question of importance upon which the determination of the Court of Appeal would be to the public advantage. 39It was not in dispute that UOB was unable to complete on 19 July 2005 but that was because of Candid’s failure to obtain the EBS before 13 July 2005. Again, I did not see how either of the two stated grounds could apply as the principle is clear that a defaulting party cannot take advantage of his own default. 40As for the judgment inSee Hup Seng Tin, I had not agreed or disagreed with the assumption of the Court of Appeal. I also did not decide whether the Consent Letter constituted JTC’s approval as it was not necessary to do so in the light of the parties’ subsequent agreement that 19 July 2005 was the contractual completion date. 41Indeed, when Mr Lim appeared before me to present his submissions on the leave application, he couched his ground differently. He said that there was a serious question of law to be decided by the Court of Appeal, the question being, “Can the wrong interpretation give rise to estoppel if [UOB] has suffered no detriment”. Yet, Mr Lim raised no specific argument in respect of the doctrine of estoppel by convention. 42In so far as the subsequent agreement might also amount to a variation, Mr Lim submitted that there could be no variation if the parties were not consciously seeking to vary the contract. 43I agreed with Mr Kumar’s submission that the doctrine of estoppel by convention applied when both parties had proceeded on a certain interpretation of a contract although estoppel by convention is not confined to an interpretation of a contract. It did not matter whether the parties’ interpretation was right or wrong or whether UOB had suffered any detriment. In any event, as I have said, the doctrine of estoppel by convention is not new and its application to particular facts did not justify my granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 44As for the parties’ agreement (through solicitors) on the contractual completion date, that was binding on both sides irrespective of whether it was an affirmation or variation of the original terms of the Option. It was not open to one side to resile from what it had agreed. Its intention outside of the clear words of its agreement was irrelevant. Again, there was nothing to justify my granting leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal. 45In the circumstances, I dismissed the leave application."
