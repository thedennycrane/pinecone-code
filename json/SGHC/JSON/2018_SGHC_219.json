        "Introduction": "1 The two accused persons were jointly tried for offences under the Misuse of Drugs Act (Cap 185, 2008 Rev Ed) (“MDA”). The first accused, Khor Chong Seng (“Khor”), claimed trial to a charge of importing into Singapore three packets containing not less than 57.05g of diamorphine, an offence under s 7 of the MDA. The second accused, Han Fang Guan (“Han”), claimed trial to a charge of attempting to possess one packet containing not less than 18.62g of diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking, an offence under s 5(1)(a) read with s 5(2) and s 12 of the MDA. 2 At the conclusion of the trial, I found that the charges against Khor and Han had been proved beyond a reasonable doubt, and convicted them accordingly. 3 Under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule to the MDA, the prescribed punishment for the offences is death. However, s 33B(1)(a) provides that if the two requirements set out in s 33B(2) of the MDA are satisfied, the court has a discretion not to impose the death penalty. The first requirement is that the acts of the accused are confined to those of a “courier”. The second requirement is that the Public Prosecutor (“PP”) certifies that the accused has substantively assisted the Central Narcotics Bureau (“CNB”) in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. 4 I found that Khor met both requirements, and exercised my discretion to impose the sentence of life imprisonment and the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane. However, Han met neither of the requirements. Therefore, I passed the mandatory death sentence on Han. 5 Han has filed an appeal against conviction and sentence. I now provide the reasons for my decision.",
        "The Prosecution’s case": "",
        "Events leading up to Khor’s arrest and seizure of the drugs": "6 On 2 March 2016, at about 12.10am, Khor arrived at the Woodlands Checkpoint, Singapore, on his Malaysian-registered motorcycle bearing registration number JQT1173. Khor was subjected to a search. From within the inner lining of Khor’s two motorcycle helmets bearing the logos “LTD” and “ARC” respectively, the CNB officers recovered seven bundles of controlled drugs (“the drugs”) as follows:1Foot Note 1×AB 546–547 at para 9. (a) a large bundle wrapped in black tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked C1B;(b) a large bundle wrapped in black tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked C1C;(c) a small bundle wrapped in black tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the words “KEN 水 500”, marked C1D;(d) a bundle wrapped in transparent tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked C1E;(e) a large bundle wrapped in black tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked D1B;(f) a bundle wrapped in transparent tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked D1C; and(g) a bundle wrapped in transparent tape, with a yellow sticker bearing the word “KEN”, marked D1D. 7 The charge against Khor concerned the diamorphine contained in exhibits C1B, C1C and D1B, while the charge against Han concerned the diamorphine in exhibit D1B. 8 Khor informed the CNB officers that he was tasked to deliver the drugs to a few recipients. He was waiting for instructions from his boss known as “Lao Ban”. He was willing to assist in a follow-up operation against the intended recipients of the drugs. Thereafter, Khor proceeded to communicate with “Lao Ban”, as well as the intended recipients of the drugs to make arrangements to meet them for the delivery of the drugs.2Foot Note 2×AB 557–558 at paras 7–15; AB 560-561 at paras 4–12.The various phone calls between Khor and the intended recipients, including Han, were recorded by the CNB officers.3Foot Note 3×AB 557 at para 7; AB 560 at para 4.",
        "Han’s arrest": "9 Sometime before 2 March 2016, Han contacted a drug supplier based in Malaysia known to him as “Ah Tiong” to place an order for drugs. Han contacted “Ah Tiong” at +60 146101016, the same mobile number used by the drug supplier known to Khor as “Lao Ban”. The mobile phone which Han used to contact “Ah Tiong” (which was seized upon his arrest and marked as “HFG-HP4”) bore the number 98676050.4Foot Note 4×AB 233; AB 378; AB 650 at para 4. 10 On 2 March 2016 at about 2.04am, while in the custody of the CNB officers, Khor received an SMS message from “Lao Ban” stating “T-98676050=$3600”.5Foot Note 5×AB 94.As mentioned, the number 98676050 corresponds to Han’s mobile phone number. Shortly after receiving the SMS message, Khor received a phone call from “Lao Ban”. During this conversation, “Lao Ban” instructed Khor to deliver one of the three “yellow” “big” bundles to “T”. Khor was also instructed to collect $3,600 from “T”.6Foot Note 6×AB 513–514; AB 563–564. 11 At about 2.43am, the call records show that Han received a phone call from “Ah Tiong” (using the number +60 146101016).7Foot Note 7×AB 408. 12 At about 2.44am, Khor received a phone call from “Lao Ban” on his mobile phone. During this conversation, “Lao Ban” told Khor that he would ask “T” to call Khor.8Foot Note 8×AB 382, 520. 13 At about 2.45am, Han received an SMS message from “Ah Tiong”, stating “T-86531409=$3600”.9Foot Note 9×AB 234.The number 86531409 corresponds to Khor’s mobile phone number. 14 At about 2.47am, Han called Khor and introduced himself as “T”. Han told Khor to proceed to Lorong 7, Toa Payoh.10Foot Note 10×AB 521.Over four further phone calls from 4.02am to 4.40am, arrangements were made for Khor to meet Han at Block 5, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh.11Foot Note 11×AB 408, 531, 536–538. 15 Acting on the information received from this operation, CNB officers SSgt Bukhari bin Ahmad (“SSgt Bukhari”) and Sgt Yogaraj s/o Ragunathan Pillay (“Sgt Yogaraj”) from the CNB Special Task Force (collectively, “the STF officers”), along with another team of CNB officers led by Insp Tong Hyeng Ji Xanthus (“Insp Tong”), proceeded to Block 5, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh to arrest Han. 16 SSgt Bukhari and Sgt Yogaraj stopped their CNB operational car on Lorong 7, shortly after passing the entrance leading to Block 5. Insp Tong followed closely behind the operational car in a taxi. 17 Sometime after 4.35am, from their vehicle, the STF officers spotted Han standing at the void deck of Block 5.12Foot Note 12×Tr/01.02.18/36/8.There was nobody else at the void deck at the material time.13Foot Note 13×AB 636 at para 6.The STF officers were then instructed to effect arrest. As the STF officers began to approach Han, he started walking quickly towards Block 4, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh where he was eventually arrested. 18 Insp Tong’s team arrived shortly after and took custody of Han and searched his belongings. W/SSgt Vigneshwari d/o Thanabal recovered $3,600 in cash from the front left pocket of Han’s shorts. The cash was found bundled with a rubber band, kept separately from some other loose cash kept in a wallet.14Foot Note 14×Tr/30.01.18/104/26–32. 19 Subsequently, Han was brought to his place of residence at Block 5, Lorong 7, Toa Payoh, #11-133, Singapore, where various other amounts of drugs were recovered. This included one bundle marked “A1C1A1A” which was subsequently analysed and found to contain not less than 6.77g of diamorphine. For the sake of clarity, I highlight that this bundle was not the subject of the charge against Han.",
        "Analysis of the drugs": "20 The contents of the seven bundles of drugs seized from the two helmets were sent to the Health Sciences Authority (“HSA”) for analysis. Exhibits C1B, C1C and D1B were large black bundles of roughly the same size. They contained a granular/powdery substance. The results of the HSA analysis were as follows: (a) Exhibit C1B: total weight of 458.9g, analysed and found to contain not less than 18.80g of diamorphine.15Foot Note 15×AB 306.(b) Exhibit C1C: total weight of 457.3g, analysed and found to contain not less than 19.63g of diamorphine.16Foot Note 16×AB 307.(c) Exhibit D1B: total weight of 457.4g, analysed and found to contain not less than 18.62g of diamorphine.17Foot Note 17×AB 309. 21 Exhibit C1D was a considerably smaller bundle, also wrapped in black tape. It contained a crystalline substance with a total weight of 49.85g, which was analysed and found to contain not less than 34.04g of methamphetamine.18Foot Note 18×AB 308.For completeness, the other three bundles recovered from Khor, namely Exhibits C1E, D1C and D1D, were wrapped in transparent tape and contained strips of nimetazepam tablets.",
        "Statements made by Khor": "22 Pursuant to s 258(1) of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cap 68, 2012 Rev Ed) (“CPC”), the Prosecution sought to admit four statements recorded from Khor in the course of investigations. Khor did not object to the admissibility of any of his statements.19Foot Note 19×Khor’s closing submissions at paras 35, 39.The four statements were: (a) One contemporaneous statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by SI Pang Hee Lim (“SI Pang”) on 2 March 2016.(b) The cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC by the Investigating Officer, Insp Teh Chee Sim Karlson (“IO Teh”), on 3 March 2016.(c) Two long statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC by IO Teh on 8 and 9 March 2016. 23 In his contemporaneous statement, Khor said that the bundles found in the two helmets contained drugs belonging to his boss, which he was to deliver to various persons according to his boss’s instructions after he had cleared the Singapore customs. After his arrest on 2 March 2016, he received instructions from “Lao Ban” to send “02 big black bundle” to the person codenamed “99”, “01 big black bundle” to the person codenamed “T”, and the rest of the bundles to the person codenamed “kent” (elsewhere also referred to as “Ken”). He was also instructed to collect $6,800 from “99” and $3,600 from “T”. Khor stated that he “[did] not know what kind of drug [was] packed in both the helmet[s]” and that “boss told me it won’t ‘hang’ me”.20Foot Note 20×AB 567. 24 In his cautioned statement, Khor’s stated defence was that he “did not see the 3 bundles of things before [his] arrest” and that his boss had told him that “the amount will not lead to a death penalty”. He added that he “d[id] not know much”, and that he would simply deliver the drugs “according to [his boss’s] instruction” and “the markings on the packages”.21Foot Note 21×AB 712. 25 In his first long statement, Khor detailed how he had met “Lao Ban” and the jobs he had done for “Lao Ban” up to his arrest. I outline the salient points: (a) Khor had been introduced to “Lao Ban” by a friend by the name of “Ah De”. “Ah De” knew that Khor was in financial difficulty, and had suggested that Khor take up a job delivering drugs to recipients in Singapore some two months prior to Khor’s arrest.22Foot Note 22×AB 714 at para 5.Khor said that he had been repeatedly assured by “Ah De” that “the amount would not cause [him] to face the death penalty”23Foot Note 23×AB 714 at para 5.and that he “[would] not die due to it”.24Foot Note 24×AB 714 at para 6. (b) According to Khor, he did not agree at first, but eventually relented and made his first delivery on 26 February 2016. He successfully made two subsequent deliveries thereafter, and also made one trip to collect payment on behalf of “Lao Ban”. Khor was arrested while on his fourth delivery.25Foot Note 25×AB 714 at paras 5–6. (c) Themodus operandifor the deliveries was as follows: (i) Khor would collect the drugs from “Lao Ban” at a condominium in Malaysia. The drugs were packed in motorcycle helmets. According to Khor, he did not see nor was he told what type of drugs were packed into the helmet, or how much drugs were packed. However, he was assured by “Lao Ban” and one “Xiao Di” (the person who handed him the helmets) that the quantity was “little” and “would not cause [him] to face the death penalty”.26Foot Note 26×AB 715 at para 9, 724 at para 43. (ii) After Khor had cleared customs and crossed into Singapore, he would call “Lao Ban”, who would then send him a text message containing instructions as to who to deliver the drugs to, as well as the amount of payment to collect. For this purpose, Khor was given a SIM card by “Lao Ban” with the number 86531409. He was instructed to contact “Lao Ban” at a Malaysian phone number, +60 146101016.27Foot Note 27×AB 715 at paras 8, 10. (iii) After Khor had made the deliveries and collected the payments, he would return to Malaysia to hand the money to “Lao Ban” at the condominium.28Foot Note 28×AB 716 at para 14. 26 In relation to his fourth delivery, during which he was arrested, Khor recounted the following in his first long statement: (a) On 2 March 2016, he was stopped at the Singapore checkpoint for a search. When one of the officers removed the inner cushion from the helmet, Khor knew the drugs had been exposed.29Foot Note 29×AB 723 at para 37. (b) Khor was asked to “cooperate with the authorities and provide useful assistance” and he agreed. He was instructed to call “Lao Ban” to explain his delay in calling to ask for instructions. “Lao Ban” accepted Khor’s explanation, and sent him the delivery instructions via text message.30Foot Note 30×AB 723 at para 37.Khor recounted that “Lao Ban” also verbally instructed him to deliver “two big black bundles” to “99” and to deliver “one big black” bundle to “T”. The remaining bundles were to be delivered to one “Ken”.31Foot Note 31×AB 723 at para 38. (c) Khor was instructed by the CNB officers to contact the person codenamed “99” to set up a meeting at Teck Whye.32Foot Note 32×AB 723 at para 39.Shortly after, “Ken” called Khor, and Khor was directed to set up a meeting at “Big Hotel”.33Foot Note 33×AB 724 at para 41.Khor was then asked to contact “T”. “T” had initially asked to meet on the tenth floor of Block 5, but the CNB officers instructed Khor to set up a meeting at the roadside, to which “T” agreed.34Foot Note 34×AB 724 at para 42.Khor later learnt that all three persons had been arrested. (d) Khor was “shocked” when shown the amount of drugs taken out from the helmets. It was the first time he found out that the helmet contained diamorphine. He did not know “how much drugs or the type of drugs hidden in the helmets”.35Foot Note 35×AB 724 at para 43. 27 In his second long statement, Khor confirmed that he had not seen the bundles of drugs until the CNB officer removed them from the helmet after his arrest. Khor said that he did not know what the bundles contained, though he did suspect that they contained something illegal, such as “Five” (a street name for Erimin-5 or nimetazepame). However, according to Khor, he never expected that the bundles would contain “heroin” (a street name for diamorphine).36Foot Note 36×AB 730 at paras 45 and 46.",
        "Statements made by Han": "28 Pursuant to s 258(1) of the CPC, the Prosecution sought to admit six statements recorded from Han in the course of investigations. No objections were made to the admissibility of any of these statements. The six statements were: (a) Two contemporaneous statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC on 2 March 2016 by SSSgt Ho Poh Wah and Insp Tong respectively.(b) The cautioned statement recorded under s 23 of the CPC by IO Teh on 2 March 2016.(c) Two long statements recorded under s 22 of the CPC by Insp Huang Yixia on 8 and 9 March 2016.(d) One long statement recorded under s 22 of the CPC by IO Teh on 31 August 2016. 29 In his contemporaneous statements, Han explained that the sum of $3,600 found on him at the time of his arrest was meant for gambling. He also said that the phone number 86531409 belonged to a friend known to him as “mu chi”, and that the number +60 146101016 belonged to a Malaysian friend known to him as “Ah Tiong”.37Foot Note 37×AB 607.Han later clarified in his 8 March 2016 long statement that the number 86531409 belonged to a stranger who had contacted him (and not “mu chi”).38Foot Note 38×AB 650 at para 4. 30 Han’s cautioned statement was given in respect of the initial charge, which had been framed in terms of abetment of Khor’s importation offence by conspiracy. To that charge, Han said that he “did not personally tell [Khor]” to bring the drugs into Singapore, and that he did not know that Khor would be coming, or even who Khor was.39Foot Note 39×AB 701. 31 In his first two long statements, Han recounted the events leading up to his arrest on 2 March 2016: (a) Han confirmed that the number +60 146101016 belonged to “Ah Tiong”, whom he knew as a drug supplier from Malaysia. Han said that he ordered drugs like Ice (a street name for methamphetamine), Ketamine and Erimin from him.40Foot Note 40×AB 650 at para 4. (b) Han had only recently begun placing orders for drugs with “Ah Tiong”. The first order was made around end February 2016, and was for 500 tablets of Erimin and about 50g of Ice. His second (and last) order of drugs from “Ah Tiong” was placed on 1 March 2016, and was for 100g of Ketamine and 25g of Ice. This would have cost him a total of $3,200. The drugs that he ordered were both for consumption and for sale.41Foot Note 41×AB 651 at para 12.Han stressed that he had never ordered “peh hoon” (a street name for diamorphine) from “Ah Tiong”.42Foot Note 42×AB 652 at para 13. (c) Han would call “Ah Tiong” to place his order when he needed drugs. “Ah Tiong” would then call back to arrange for someone to deliver the drugs to Han. The person delivering the drugs would then call Han, and Han would collect the drugs from that person, and make payment.43Foot Note 43×AB 652 at para 12. (d) On 2 March 2016, he woke up at about 3am and decided to go to the market to gamble. The gambling session was to be held at the food centre at Toa Payoh Lorong 8.44Foot Note 44×AB 650 at para 3. (e) At around 4am or 5am, he headed to the market to gamble. While he was walking to the market, a “stranger” – using the number 86531409 – called him and asked him to meet at the ground level of his flat.45Foot Note 45×AB 650 at para 3.Curiously, however, Han later said at para 12 of the same statement that “no arrangement was made with the stranger for us to meet up”.46Foot Note 46×AB 651 at para 12.There was also some inconsistency as to how much Han knew about this call. At para 4 of his 8 March 2016 statement, Han said that he did not know who the stranger was or what the stranger wanted.47Foot Note 47×AB 650 at para 4.However, in that same statement at para 12, Han said that he had “suspect[ed] that there is a possibility that the person could be delivering the drugs that [he] ordered”.48Foot Note 48×AB 651 at para 12. (f) On 2 March 2016, before he could reach the food centre for a gambling session, he was arrested.49Foot Note 49×AB 650 at para 5. (g) When Han was arrested, over $4,000 in cash was found on him. $3,600 was found tied with a rubber band in his front pocket and the rest was found in his back pocket. In his 8 March 2016 statement, Han said that he had specifically split the $3,600 from the rest of his money because he intended to use it during the gambling session.50Foot Note 50×AB 651 at para 8.He expressly denied that the $3,600 was meant for paying for the diamorphine.51Foot Note 51×AB 652 at para 12.In the 9 March 2016 statement, he said that the $3,200 that he owed “Ah Tiong” for the Ketamine and Ice would have been paid out of the $3,600.52Foot Note 52×AB 666 at A4. (h) Part of Han’s 9 March 2016 statement was recorded in a ‘Question and Answer’ format. When he was asked what the message “T-86531409=$3600” meant, Han said that he had not seen the message, and in any case did not know what the reference to $3,600 meant because he owed “Ah Tiong” $3,200.53Foot Note 53×AB 666 at A5. 32 In his third long statement recorded on 31 August 2016, Han stated again that his order, placed before the day of his arrest, was for 100g of Ketamine and 25g of Ice, and was to cost $3,200. Han emphasised that he did not order any “heroin” from Ah Tiong.54Foot Note 54×AB 748 at paras 23–24.. Han also said that on the day of his arrest, he had received a call from a Singapore-registered phone number. The caller told Han that he had been instructed to call Han by someone “inside”, which Han understood to mean “from Malaysia”. Han assumed that the caller had been instructed by Ah Tiong to deliver his order of drugs.55Foot Note 55×AB 748 at para 23.",
        "Close of the Prosecution’s case": "33 At the close of the Prosecution’s case, I found that there was sufficient evidence against both Khor and Han and called upon them to give evidence in their own defence.",
        "Khor’s defence": "34 Khor did not deny that he had imported the diamorphine into Singapore. His defence was that he did not know that the bundles contained diamorphine and that he did not know that the quantity of drugs he was carrying would attract the death penalty.56Foot Note 56×Tr/06.02.18/21, 44, 45. 35 I highlight the key aspects of his evidence. When Khor collected the drugs from “Lao Ban”, he did not see the drugs being packed into the helmets, nor was he told what the helmets contained.57Foot Note 57×Tr/06.02.18/20–21, 54.While he had suspected that the bundles contained illegal drugs, he thought they contained only “soft drugs” such as Ice or Erimin.58Foot Note 58×Tr/06.02.18/17.In fact, “Ah De” had assured him that the job would involve “soft drugs”.59Foot Note 59×Tr/06.02.18/9/18–21, 19/5–6, 46/7–8. 36 Further, he had received repeated assurances from “Lao Ban”60Foot Note 60×Tr/06.02.18/19–20, 45, 64.and “Xiao Di” that the amount of drugs he was carrying “would not cause [him] to face the death penalty”.61Foot Note 61×AB 715 at para 9.“Ah De” had also given Khor assurances to that effect, and Khor had trusted him because “Ah De” was a friend who knew of his concerns.62Foot Note 62×Tr/06.02.18/64/24 – 65/10. 37 Also, he had no reason to believe that the bundles contained diamorphine since, on his previous deliveries, Khor had delivered clear bundles which he could see contained Erimin tablets. Although there were also bundles wrapped in black tape on his previous deliveries, those bundles were considerably smaller than the black bundles which are the subject of the charge. 38 Khor also said that he could not have checked the contents of the bundles as the journey from the condominium in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, was a short one without any side roads where Khor could have stopped to check the contents of the helmets.63Foot Note 63×Tr/06.02.18/48/1–18.After his arrest, while on a call with “Lao Ban” as part of the CNB operation against the intended recipients of the drugs, he had asked “Lao Ban” what was in the big bundles, but “Lao Ban” cut him off, saying “you don’t need to care”.64Foot Note 64×Tr/06.02.18/19/1–9.",
        "Han’s defence": "39 Han admitted that he had ordered drugs from “Ah Tiong” but denied that he had ordered anydiamorphinefrom “Ah Tiong”. According to Han, his order was only for 100g of Ketamine and 25g of Ice.65Foot Note 65×Tr/07.02.18/7/30–31, 18/18–22, 21/24–25.To the extent that Khor’s instructions were to deliver diamorphine to him, this was a due to a “mix-up” in the orders on the part of “Ah Tiong”.66Foot Note 66×Tr/07.02.18/70/1–6.Han pointed out that Khor had been instructed to deliver a yellow bundle to him, when in fact there were no yellow bundles amongst those that Khor had been caught with on 2 March 2016. 40 On the morning of 2 March 2016, Han had been on his way to gamble at a nearby market when he received a call in respect of the order of Ketamine and Ice he had placed the previous day. He was told to wait at the ground floor of Block 5, Toa Payoh, and was kept waiting for a long time.67Foot Note 67×Tr/07.02.18/34/28–32.When he was arrested, he was walking from Block 5 to Block 4 in the direction of the market.68Foot Note 68×Tr/07.02.18/27–28. 41 Exactly $3,600 in cash was found in Han’s front pocket. He had intended to use this money at the gambling session. However, should his order of drugs arrive, he would use that money to pay for the drugs. He expected to pay $2,200 for 100g of Ketamine and $1,000 for 25g of Ice. The remaining $400 was a prior debt owed to “Ah Tiong”.69Foot Note 69×Tr/07.02.18/9/1–11.",
        "Decision on conviction": "42 I shall now state the law applicable to the charge against each of the accused persons, analyse the relevant evidence and then state my findings.",
        "Khor": "101 The Prosecution did not contest Khor’s assertion that he was a mere courier.110Foot Note 110×Tr/03.07.18/6/27–29.On the facts, Khor’s role in the drug transaction was restricted to importing the diamorphine, and then delivering it to the various recipients according to the instructions of “Lao Ban”. While he was also expected to collect payments from the various recipients, these could be considered as acts incidental to the delivery of the drugs. I therefore found on a balance of probabilities that his acts fell within the acts of a courier under s 33B(2)(a)(i) of the MDA. Khor was issued a certificate of substantive assistance by the PP. I saw no reason to impose the death penalty, nor did the Prosecution submit that there was any such reason. Accordingly, I imposed the alternative sentence of life imprisonment, backdated to the date of his arrest on 2 March 2016, and the mandatory minimum of 15 strokes of the cane.",
        "Han": "102 Han was the intended recipient of the diamorphine. As I had found above, Han had attempted to obtain possession of the diamorphine for the purpose of trafficking in it. Given the nature of his defence, which went to his knowledge of the nature and quantity of the drugs rather than the degree of his involvement, Han did not adduce any evidence that he was merely a courier. I therefore found that Han had not proved on a balance of probabilities that he was a mere courier. The PP did not issue Han a certificate of substantive assistance. Since Han met neither of the requirements in s 33B of the MDA, the alternative sentencing regime was not available. Accordingly, I imposed the mandatory sentence of death on Han.

        "Decision on sentence": "100 As I had earlier mentioned, the prescribed punishment under s 33(1) read with the Second Schedule of the MDA is death, although the alternative sentencing regime in s 33B(1)(a) of the MDA provides the court a discretion to impose a mandatory term of life imprisonment and 15 strokes of the cane provided that certain requirements are met. These are that (i) the offender must show that his acts fall within s 33B(2)(a)(i)–(iv) of the MDA, and (ii) the PP certifies that the offender has substantively assisted the CNB in disrupting drug trafficking activities within or outside Singapore. Under s 33B(4) of the MDA, the PP has sole discretion as to the determination of whether to give or withhold a certificate of substantive assistance."
