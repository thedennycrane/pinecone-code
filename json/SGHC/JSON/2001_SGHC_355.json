        "Background facts": "2.    The relevant facts giving rise to the appeal are as follows.\n\nThe appellant, Mr Tan Boon Hai, and those whom he represents in this appeal, and the 33 defendants\n\nagainst whom proceedings were brought in the court below, are all members of a clan association\n\ncalled the Singapore Hainan Hwee Kuan (the Association). Some two years ago, a dispute arose\n\nover the election of members to the management committee of the Association. It was alleged by some\n\nmembers that there were irregularities at the election of the Associations 1999/2000 Management\n\nCommittee during the Annual General Meeting held on 30 May 1999. Mr Tan in a representative capacity\n\non behalf of himself and all the unsuccessful candidates at the election initiated proceedings\n\nagainst the Association and 33 members of the Association, who were the successful candidates. In\n\nthose proceedings, Mr Tan sought a declaration that the election held on 30 May 1999 was null and\n\nvoid for irregularity, and alternatively, an order restraining the 33 members from acting or holding\n\nthemselves out as members of the Associations management committee. Mr Tan also sought an order\n\nfor a fresh election to be held and an order to freeze the funds of the Association.3.    Soon after the commencement of the proceedings, on 29 July\n\n1999, an interim order was obtained by Mr Tan partially freezing the Associations bank account.\n\nThe case proceeded to trial and was heard for some nine days with the cross-examination of\n\nwitnesses. A further period of 15 days was given by the court for the continuation of the hearing.\n\nHowever, no further hearing took place, as the parties came to a settlement. The action was then\n\ndiscontinued by Mr Tan with the consent of the defendants, but the consent was given subject to Mr\n\nTan paying 80% of the costs, such costs to be taxed on the standard basis, if not agreed. The\n\nparties failed to reach agreement on the quantum of the costs, and accordingly the costs had to be\n\ntaxed.4.    In those proceedings, there were three groups of defendants.\n\nThe first defendant, the Association, was independently advised and at the trial was represented by\n\nits own counsel. The second group consisted of 17 defendants, namely, the 2ndto 17thand 21stdefendants. They were separately advised by their solicitors and at the trial\n\nthey were represented by their own counsel. The remaining defendants formed the third group and they\n\nhad their own solicitors and counsel in those proceedings.5.    Pursuant to the terms on which Mr Tan discontinued the\n\naction, the 2ndto 17thand the 21stdefendants (collectively\n\ncalled the 17 defendants) proceeded first to present their bill of costs for taxation. Pending\n\nthe taxation of this bill, the other two groups of defendants held back the submission of their\n\nrespective bills of costs. Hence, there will be another two bills of costs for taxation relating to\n\nthe same proceedings.6.    In their bill of costs, the 17 defendants claimed a sum of\n\n$250,000 for work done in the cause or matter as described in section 1 of the bill. The bill was\n\ntaxed by an assistant registrar, who allowed a sum of $100,000 for this section of the bill. Both Mr\n\nTan and the defendants were dissatisfied with the amount awarded and applied to the assistant\n\nregistrar to review her decision with respect to this amount pursuant to O 59 r 34 of the Rules of\n\nCourt. On review, the assistant registrar reduced the amount to $70,000. The 17 defendants, being\n\ndissatisfied with this amount allowed by the assistant registrar on such review, applied to a judge\n\nin chambers for an order to review the taxation of this amount pursuant to O 59 r 36 of the Rules of\n\nCourt.",
        "The decision below": "7.    The application came before G P Selvam J who dealt with it\n\nin the following manner. He considered that he was not bound by the decisions of the Court of Appeal\n\ninDiversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai Chung Ching Chester & Ors (No 2)[1993] 1 SLR 542,\n\nandJeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew[1993] 1 SLR 185on the ground that the law had\n\nundergone a sea of change since the two cases. He held that the new rule in the present\n\nRules of Court, which he said came into effect on 1 February 1992, allowed him to have\n\nthe right and duty to hear the matter de novo,and take into account all the circumstances of\n\nthe case and make a completely fresh decision. He relied on the decision of the English Court of\n\nAppeal inMadurasinghe v Penguin Electronics (a firm)[1993] 3 All ER 20;[1993] 1 WLR\n\n989, where the court considered a similar rule under the County Court Rules 1981 in England. He also\n\nrelied by analogy on those case where a judge hears an appeal from the decision of the registrar on\n\nassessment of damages. In such case, it has been held by this Court that a judge in hearing such\n\nappeal is not fettered by the amount awarded by the registrar and is entitled to deal with the\n\nappeal, as if the matter came before him the first time: seeChang Ah Lek and Ors v Lim Ah Koon[1999] 1 SLR 82which followed and adopted the decision of the House of Lords inEvans v Bartlam[1937] 2 All ER 646;[1937] AC 473. Selvam J then expressed his opinion that the power of a\n\njudge in dealing with an application for review of taxation of costs and with an appeal from the\n\ndecision of the registrar on assessment of damages does not depend on the terminology of review,\n\nrehearing or appeal as found in the rules; these terms mean the same thing, namely the\n\njudge hearing the matter deals with it de novo.Thus, considering himself armed with an\n\nunfettered discretion, the judge proceeded to reconsider the circumstances of the case. He set aside\n\nthe amount awarded by the assistant registrar and awarded the sum of $100,000 in lieu. He further\n\nawarded $1,500 as the costs of the review before him. Against his decision, this appeal is now\n\nbrought.",
        "The appeal": "8.    Before we turn to the consider the arguments raised in the\n\nappeal we should mention one preliminary matter. The 17 defendants, the respondents in this appeal,\n\ndid not file the Respondents Case, as they were required to do under the rules. However, through\n\ntheir counsel they put in a written skeletal submission and intended to obtain leave of the\n\nCourt, by an oral application, to argue against the appeal before us. Counsel for the appellant\n\nobjected to this course of conduct on the part of the respondents. In response, counsel for the\n\nrespondents explained that the reason for not filing the Respondents Case was that the\n\nrespondents wished to save further costs and expenses in the litigation, and applied orally for\n\nleave to make submission before us in this appeal. We did not find such explanation acceptable, and\n\naccordingly we refused leave to counsel for the respondents to make any submission on behalf of the\n\nrespondents in resisting the appeal. We also refused to consider the written skeletal submission\n\nfiled in Court.9.    We now turn to the merits of the appeal. Before us, Mr Yang\n\nIng Loong, counsel for Mr Tan, contends that the judge erred in holding that there was a sea of\n\nchange in the Rules of Court, and that the decisions of this Court inDiverseyandJeyaretnamare still good law and the judge therefore was bound by these decisions and ought to follow them.\n\nHad the judge followed these decisions,he would not have interfered with the amount awarded\n\nby the assistant registrar, as he did not find that the assistant registrar had committed an error\n\nof principle or any material error on the quantum.",
        "Rules of Court": "10.    We need to consider first whether there has been a sea\n\nof change in our rules of court governing the review by a judge of taxation of costs since the\n\ndecisions of this Court inDiverseyandJeyaretnam. At the time when these two cases\n\nwere decided, the rules then in force were the Rules of the Supreme Court 1970 (the 1970 Rules),\n\nand the relevant rules governing the review by a judge of taxation of costs were found in O 59 r 36,\n\nwhich so far as relevant provided as follows: -(1) Any party who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Registrar to allow\n\n  or to disallow any item in whole or in part on review under Rule 34 or 35, or with the amount\n\n  allowed in respect of any item by the Registrar on any such review, may apply to a Judge for an\n\n  order to review the taxation as to that item or part of an item, if, but only if, one of the\n\n  parties to the proceedings before the Registrar requested the Registrar in accordance with Rule 35\n\n  (3) to state the reasons for his decision in respect of that item or part on the review.(2) .(3) ..(4) Unless the Judge otherwise directs, no further evidence shall be received\n\n  on the hearing of an application under this Rule, and no ground of objection shall be raised which\n\n  was not raised on the review by the Registrar but, save as aforesaid, on the hearing of any such\n\n  application the Judge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the Registrar\n\n  in relation to the subject-matter of the application.(5) On an application under this Rule, the Judge may make such order as the\n\n  circumstances require, and in particular may order the Registrars certificate to be amended or,\n\n  except where the dispute as to the item under review is as to amount only, order the item to be\n\n  remitted to the Registrar for taxation.(6) In this Rule \"Judge\" means a Judge in person.11.    On 27 November 1991, amendments were made to the 1970 Rules\n\nby the Rules of the Supreme Court (Amendment No. 3) Rules 1991, which came into effect on 1 February\n\n1992. The amendments then made included the repeal of the entire O 59 and the replacement with\n\na new O 59; but the text of r 36 in the repealed O 59 and that in the new O 59 were exactly the\n\nsame. Thus, in effect no amendment was then made to r 36. The judge, with respect, was in error when\n\nhe said at  13:3 The new rule came into effect on 1 February 1992. But because the taxation in\n\n  both cases [i.e.DiverseyandJeyaretnamcases] had taken place before 1992 they\n\n  were governed by the old rule.In our opinion, whether the taxation of the costs in the two cases took place\n\nbefore or after 1 February 1992, the application for review of taxation of costs before a judge was\n\ngoverned by the same rule.12.    The 1970 Rules remained in force until 1 April 1996, when\n\nthe entire rules (subject to a couple of transitional provisions) were repealed and replaced by the\n\npresent Rules of Court. The provisions of the present rules governing the review of taxation by a\n\njudge are found in O 59 r 36 which, so far as relevant, are as follows:36.  (1) Any party who is dissatisfied with the decision of the Registrar to\n\n  allow or to disallow any item in whole or in part on review under Rule 34 or 35, or with the\n\n  amount allowed in respect of any item by the Registrar on any such review, may apply to a Judge\n\n  for an order to review the taxation as to that item or part of an item, if, but only if, one of\n\n  the parties to the proceedings before the Registrar requested the Registrar in accordance with\n\n  Rule 35 (3) to state the reasons for his decision in respect of that item or part on the review.(2)(3)(4) Unless the Judge otherwise directs, no further evidence shall be received\n\n  on the hearing of an application under this Rule, and no ground of objection shall be raised which\n\n  was not raised on the review by the Registrar but, except as aforesaid, on the hearing of any such\n\n  application the Judge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the Registrar\n\n  in relation to the subject-matter of the application.(5) On an application under this Rule, the Judge may make such order as the\n\n  circumstances require, and in particular may order the Registrars certificate to be amended or,\n\n  except where the dispute as to the item under review is as to amount only, order the item to be\n\n  remitted to the Registrar for taxation.(6) In this Rule, \"Judge\" means a Judge of the High Court or a\n\n  District Judge in person.13.    As can be seen from the relevant provisions of the present\n\nRules of Court and the 1970 Rules, which we have set out, there were no material changes made to O\n\n59 r 36 by the Rules of Court in 1996. In fact, the provisions of O 59 r 36 of the 1970 Rules\n\nand those of O 59 r 36 of the Rules of Court are the same in all material respects. With the utmost\n\nrespect to the judge, we do not find that there was any sea of change in the law, whether on\n\nthe basis of the amendments made to the rules on 1 February 1992 or the amendments made on 1 April\n\n1996. In our judgment, the judge, with respect, erred in regarding himself as not being bound by the\n\ndecisions of this Court inDiverseyandJeyaretnam. In conformity with the principles\n\nofstare decisisthe judge ought to have followed the rule as laid down in the two cases.",
        "Reconsideration of Diversey and Jeyaretnam": "14.    That having said, in view of the very full arguments\n\naddressed to us by Mr Yang, we take this opportunity to reconsider the basis on whichDiverseyandJeyaretnamwere decided, and in particular whether the rule accepted by this Court there\n\nas settled is correct, namely: that, on a review of taxation of costs under O 59 r 36, the\n\njudge ought not to interfere with the decision of the taxing officer on the mere question of\n\nquantum, unless the taxing officer applied the wrong principles or unless the quantum awarded was\n\nobviously wrong.15.    The starting point is the decision inRe Kana Moona Syed\n\nAbubakar decd v Sultan Allaudin & Anor[1940] MLJ 4. The facts in that case were rather\n\ncomplicated and were set out at great length in the judgment of Aitken J, and it is not necessary to\n\nrecount them here. In the course of his judgment, Aitken J said at p 7:Now I have set out all the facts and circumstances out of which this\n\n  application to me under Order LXII, r. 73 arises, because I have found great difficulty in dealing\n\n  with Mr Conaghans objection to the reduction of his getting up fee from $500/- to $200/-. I am\n\n  abundantly satisfied that he went to very great pains indeed to find out whether, or not, it was\n\n  in the best interests of the testators infant grandchildren that the sale of the Theatre Royal\n\n  to the first defendant should be upheld or set aside. If I were the Registrar I should have\n\n  allowed Mr Conaghan the greater part of his fee, because I realise that the work he did was very\n\n  considerable indeed, and was well and properly done. However, I am not the Registrar, and the rule\n\n  that a judge must not interfere with the decision of a taxing officer on a mere question of\n\n  quantum, unless very exceptional circumstances are present, is both settled and of long standing.\n\n  I suppose that a judge would be justified in reducing a very exorbitant charge, in the unlikely\n\n  event of the registrar allowing one; andSmith v Bullulends some support to that\n\n  proposition. Per contra I suppose that a judge would be justified in allowing more than the\n\n  registrar has allowed, if the registrars allowance amounted to an affront to reason and common\n\n  sense.16.    Aitken Js pronouncement was followed by Choor Singh J inStarlite Ceramic Industry Ltd v Hiap Huat Pottery[1972-1974] SLR 440, where hesaid\n\nat p 442:Another general rule is that the court will not interfere with the discretion\n\n  of the taxing officer upon a mere question of quantum if the taxing officer has exercised his\n\n  discretion after considering all the circumstances and if no question of principle arises.Choor Singh J then quoted the above passage of the judgment of Aitken J, and\n\ncontinued:And 12 years later Thomson J (as he then was) expressed the same view inChin\n\n  Cham Sen v Foo Chee Sang(1952) 18 MLJ 99, at p 100:It is well settled in England that as a general rule the court will not\n\n    interfere with the discretion of a taxing officer upon a mere question of quantum if the taxing\n\n    officer has exercised his discretion after consideration of all the circumstances and if no\n\n    question of principle arises (seeRe Estate of Ogilvie[1910] P 242)Similar views were expressed by Gordon-Smith JA inMalayan Trading Co v Lee\n\n  Pak Yin(1941) 10 MLJ 207at p 209:It is, I think, unnecessary to quote any authorities in regard to the\n\n    powers, and I would add, assumed competency, of a judge sitting in appeal on a taxation matter,\n\n    as it is well settled that in regard both to quantum and to the exercise of a discretion vested\n\n    in a taxing master, it is only when such discretion has been exercised on a wrong principle or\n\n    the quantum allowed is obviously wrong that a judge will interfereChoor Singh J then held that the dispute before him was not on mere quantum, but\n\nraised a question of principle. There, the plaintiffs accepted a sum paid into court by the\n\ndefendants and thereafter discontinued the claim. The plaintiffs then presented a bill of costs for\n\ntaxation and the question was whether they were entitled to a getting up fee. The registrar\n\ndisallowed that fee, but on appeal the judge held that although the plaintiffs were not entitled to\n\na getting up fee, they were entitled to a fee which was at the discretion of the court He therefore\n\nallowed a fee, which he quantified in the sum of $200.17.    At the time when these two cases were decided, the relevant\n\nrule governing the application for review of taxation by a judge was O LXII r 73 of the Rules of\n\nSupreme Court 1934, which provided as follows:(1) Any party who is dissatisfied with the certificate or allocatur of the\n\n  Registrar, as to any item or part of an item which has been objected to as aforesaid, may within\n\n  fourteen days from the date of the certificate or allocatur, or such other time as the Court, or a\n\n  Judge or Registrar at the time he signs his certificate or allocatur allows, apply to a Judge at\n\n  Chambers for an order to review the taxation, as to the same item or part of an item.(2) The Judge may thereupon make such order as the Judge thinks just; but the\n\n  certificate or allocatur of the Registrar shall be final and conclusive as to matters which have\n\n  not been objected to in manner aforesaid.It seems to us thatKana MoonaandStarlite Ceramicwere decided on\n\nthe basis of this rule, and in our opinion no criticism can be made as to the basis of these two\n\ndecisions.18.    At this point, we should mention that there are significant\n\ndifferences between O LXII r 73 of the Rules of Supreme Court 1934 and O 59 r 36 of the present\n\nRules of Court. In particular, O LXII r 73 did not have, inter alia, the equivalent of paragraph (4)\n\nof r 36, which provides that, on the hearing of an application for review, the judge may\n\nexercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the Registrar in relation to the\n\nsubject-matter of the application.19.    We now come toDiversey (Far East) Pte Ltd v Chai Chung\n\nChing Chester & Ors (No. 2)[1993] 1 SLR 542. In that case, the plaintiffs were a chemical\n\ncompany incorporated in Singapore and belonged to the Diversey group of companies carrying on\n\nbusiness in various parts of the world. They commenced an action on 12 November 1986 against\n\nvarious defendants for, inter alia, unlawfully conspiring together to injure and/or defraud the\n\nplaintiffs, for breach of the defendants duties of fidelity under their respective contracts of\n\nemployment with the plaintiffs and for breach of fiduciary duties as directors. Three days before\n\nthe trial, the parties reached a settlement. A consent judgement was entered. Under both the\n\nsettlement agreement and the consent judgment, the plaintiffs were entitled to taxed costs on a\n\nparty and party basis. Their bill of costs was taxed by the assistant registrar, but both parties\n\nwere dissatisfied with the taxation of two items of the bill and filed separate notices of objection\n\nand applied to the assistant registrar for review. The assistant registrar made no order on either\n\npartys application for review of his taxation of the two items. They applied for a review before\n\na judge, and the judge upon review reduced the amounts awarded by the registrar. The plaintiffs\n\nappealed to the Court of Appeal. The defendants contended that the principle inKana Moona Syed\n\nAbubakar decd v Sultan Allaudin & Anor(supra) andStarlite Ceramic Industry Ltd v Hiap\n\nHuat Pottery(supra) was no longer applicable, because the relevant provisions of the Rules of\n\nthe Supreme Court 1970 were different from those of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934, on the\n\nbasis of which those cases were decided. The defendants further contended that the review by the\n\njudge operated as a rehearing and the judge was entitled to exercise his discretion in substitution\n\nfor that of the assistant registrar in respect of the amounts awarded.20.    The court, however, rejected these contentions. It\n\nconsidered the provisions of O LXII r 73, and compared that part of r 73(2), namely: the Judge\n\nmay thereupon make such order as the Judge may think just with the following part in O 59 r 36:\n\nthe judge may make such order as the circumstances require and concluded that even though the\n\nwording might have changed, the rules, in substance, provided for the same thing. The court said at\n\npp 551  552:We were unable to accept the submissions of counsel for the respondents\n\n  relating to the principles applicable on review of the registrars certificate by a judge in\n\n  chambers. In our view, what is germane to the issue is a consideration of O 59 r 36(5), in\n\n  particular the opening words:On an application under this Rule, the Judge may make such order as the\n\n    circumstances require, and in particular may order the Registrars certificate to be amended\n\n    or , except where the dispute as to the item under review is as to amount only, order the item\n\n    to be remitted to the Registrar for taxation. [Emphasis added] [sic]This was the successor to that part of [O LXII r 73(2) of the Rules of the\n\n  Supreme Court 1934] which sets out the power of the judge in the following terms:and the Judge may thereupon make such order as the Judge may think justLooking at the two sub-rules, the wording may have changed but in substance,\n\n  the rules provide for the same. The phrase as the circumstances require confers on the judge\n\n  a discretion. This discretion, however, is not unfettered and must be judicially exercised. The\n\n  judge should not interfere with the registrars decision unless there is an error of principle\n\n  or some other material error. The dicta of Aitken J inKana Moona Syed Abubakarto the\n\n  effect that a judge would be justified in interfering where the registrars decision was an\n\n  affront to reason and common sense is, in our opinion, too harsh a standard to apply. What is\n\n  required is a broad overview of the matter by the judge and if there is an error in principle or\n\n  some other material error, he will be justified in interfering with the decision below.The court further said at p 553:In our opinion, the differing amounts awarded by the learned judicial\n\n  commissioner and the AR were the result of a mere difference of opinion that did not warrant any\n\n  interference by the learned judicial commissioner.21.    The courts interpretation of O 59 r 36(5) inDiverseywas based on its view that r 36(5) was substantially similar to the corresponding provision of\n\n73(2) of O LXII of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934. There is, however, a material\n\ndifference between O LXII r 73 of the Rules of the Supreme Court 1934 and O 59 r 36 of the\n\nRules of the Supreme Court 1970, which was not considered by the Court. As we have pointed out, the\n\nformer did not have the equivalent of paragraph (4) of r 36 and in particular the following material\n\npart:(4) . . . . . . on the hearing of any such application the Judge may exercise\n\n  all such powers and discretion as vested in the Registrar in relation to the subject-matter of the\n\n  application.It is clear to us that the courts attention was not focused on this material\n\npart of paragraph (4) of r 36. In fact, the court did not consider this part of r 36(4) at all. Its\n\nattention was directed mainly at O 59 r 36(5).22.    We now turn toJeyaretnam Joshua Benjamin v Lee Kuan Yew[1993] 1 SLR 185. The decision was given by this Court (of a different composition) barely a\n\nmonth after the decision inDiversey, without however being influenced by the earlier\n\ndecision inDiversey. In that case, the bill of costs of the plaintiff was taxed by the\n\nsenior assistant registrar, and the defendant applied to him for a review of several items of the\n\nbill under O 59 r 34. At the conclusion of the review, the senior assistant registrar dismissed the\n\napplication. The defendant being dissatisfied with the decision of the senior assistant registrar on\n\nreview applied to a judge in chambers for review of the several items allowed by the senior\n\nassistant registrar under O 59 r 36. However, before the judge only the items of getting up fee of\n\nQueens Counsel and getting up fee of the solicitors for the plaintiff were in dispute. The judge\n\ndismissed the application and the defendant appealed to the Court of Appeal. The court held that the\n\nsenior assistant did not err in principle in deciding on the amount of getting up fee allowed for\n\nthe Queens Counsel but erred in principle in deciding on the amount of the getting up fee allowed\n\nfor the solicitors and reduced the amount allowed by the senior assistant registrar. In the course\n\nof the judgment, this Court said at p 189:It is settled law that in regard both to the quantum and to the exercise of the\n\n  discretion vested in a taxing officer, the court will only interfere if such discretion has been\n\n  exercised on a wrong principle or the quantum allowed is obviously wrong.In support, it citedMalayan Trading Co & Anor v Lee Pak Yin(1941) 10\n\nMLJ 207,Chin Cham Sen v Foo Chee Sang & Anor(1952) 18 MLJ 99 andGorfin v Odhams\n\nPress Ltd[1958] 1 All ER 578; [1958] 1 WLR 314.23.    It is plain to us that no arguments were considered on the\n\nissue as to the powers and discretion of the judge on hearing the application for review of taxation\n\nof the two items of costs. There was no analysis or discussion by the court of the terms of O 59 r\n\n36. The court merely accepted the two Malaysian authorities and the English authority in support of\n\nthe settled law. It is necessary now to examine these authorities and see whether they could\n\nafford any support to what the court held was settled law, regard being had to the terms of O\n\n59 r 36 of the 1970 Rules which were in effect.24.    We deal first with the two Malaysian authorities referred\n\nto. They were referred to by Choor Singh J inStarlite Ceramic(supra) and the relevant\n\npassages of the judgments given in those two cases were quoted with approval in his judgment. It is\n\nunnecessary for us to restate them. Suffice it here to say that in both cases, the court held that\n\nit was well settled that, as a general rule, on a review of taxation of costs the judge would not\n\ninterfere with the discretion of the taxing officer upon a mere question of quantum, if no question\n\nof principle arises. In neither of these two cases was there any examination of the basis on which\n\nthe settled rule was founded.25.    We now turn to the English case,Gorfin v Odham Press\n\nLtd(supra). There, the plaintiff brought an action claiming damages for personal injuries\n\nagainst the defendants who admitted liability. At the trial, the plaintiff was represented by\n\nleading and junior counsel and the quantum of damages was assessed at 650. On taxation of the\n\nplaintiffs costs, the taxing master disallowed the fee of leading counsel and upon review before\n\na judge the decision of the taxing master was upheld. Being dissatisfied with this decision, the\n\nplaintiff appealed to the Court of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed. The court held that it was not\n\nshown that the master had erred in arriving at his decision. In England, at that time, the relevant\n\nrule governing the review of taxation of costs by a judge was RSC Ord 65 r 27(41), which provided:(41) Any party who may be dissatisfied with the certificate or allocatur of the\n\n  taxing officer, as to any item or part of an item which may have been objected to as aforesaid,\n\n  may within fourteen days from the date of the certificate or allocatur, or such other time as the\n\n  Court or a Judge, or taxing officer, at the time he signs his certificate or allocatur, may allow,\n\n  apply to a Judge at Chambers for an order to review the taxation as to the same item or part of an\n\n  item, and the Judge may thereupon make such order as the Judge may think just; but the certificate\n\n  or allocatur of the taxing officer shall be final and conclusive as to all matters which shall not\n\n  have been objected to in manner aforesaid.It should be noted that this rule was identical in all material respects with O\n\nXLII r 73 of our Rules of the Supreme Court 1934. It is clear that the case was decided on the basis\n\nof this rule. Parker LJ, who delivered the main judgment of the court, said ([1958] 1 All ER 578 at\n\n579, [1958] 1 WLR 314 at 316):Although the terms of RSC, Ord 65, r 27 (41) are very wide, and in effect treat\n\n  the matter before the judge in chambers as a re-hearing, I think it is now clear in practice and\n\n  on authority that the court will only interfere with the exercise of the masters discretion if\n\n  it is clear that the master has gone wrong in principle. It is for this reason that matters of\n\n  quantum only, where no principle is involved, are rarely, if ever, interfered with. In other\n\n  matters, as indeed the question of whether there should be two counsel allowed or one counsel, it\n\n  is impossible to say that there is no principle involved; and accordingly, if it can be shown that\n\n  the master has erred in principle, then the court will exercise its own discretion in the matter.The terms of RSC, Ord 65 r 27(41), though very wide, did not have the equivalent\n\nof paragraph (4) of O 59 r 36 of our Rules of Court. Having regard to the material difference\n\nbetween our O 59 r 36 and RSC and Ord 65 r 27(41), we do not consider thatGorfinwas really\n\napplicable as an authority in support of what this Court accepted as the settled law inJeyaretnam.\n\nThere was therefore actually no authority in support.26.    We should say a word or two on the changes made to RSC in\n\nEngland. RSC, Ord 65 r 27(41) remained in force until 1960. By the Rules of the Supreme Court (No.\n\n3), 1959, which came into operation on 1 January 1960, the whole of Ord 65, RSC, with the exception\n\nof a few rules and a couple of Appendices, was revoked, and in its place the Supreme Court Costs\n\nRules 1959 and Appendices 2 and 3 were enacted, which applied in relation to business done since 1\n\nJanuary 1960. Rule 35 of this set of rules, which replaced Ord 65 r 27(41), was in all material\n\nrespects similar to O 59 r 36 of our Rules of Court. The Supreme Court Costs Rules 1959 and the\n\nAppendices formed part of RSC.27.    In 1965 there was revision of the rules, and the Rules of\n\nthe Supreme Court 1965 were enacted, which came into operation in 1 October 1966. The relevant rule\n\ngoverning the review of taxation of costs before a judge was O 62 r 35 which, so far as material,\n\nwas as follows:35(1) Any party who is dissatisfied with the decision ofa taxing officerto allow or disallow any item in whole or in part on review underrule 33 or 34, or\n\n  with the amount allowed in respect of any item bya taxing officeron any such review, may\n\n  apply to a judge for an order to review the taxation as to that item or part of an item if, but\n\n  only if, one of the parties to the proceedings before thetaxing officerrequestedthat\n\n  officerin accordance withrule 34(4)to state the reasons for his decision in respect\n\n  of that item or part on the review.(2)(3)(4) Unless the Judge otherwise directs, no further evidence shall be received\n\n  on the hearing of an application under this rule, and no ground of objection shall be raised which\n\n  was not raised on the review by thetaxing officerbut,saveas aforesaid, on the\n\n  hearing of any such application the Judge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are\n\n  vested in thetaxing officerin relation to the subject matter of the application.(5)If the judge thinks fit to exercise in relation to an application under\n\n  this rule the power of the Court to appoint assessors under section 98 of the Act, the judge shall\n\n  appoint not less than two assessors, of whom one shall be a taxing officer.(6) On an application under this rule the Judge may make such order as the\n\n  circumstances require, and in particular may order thetaxing officerscertificate to be\n\n  amended or, except where the dispute as to the item under review is as to amount only, order the\n\n  item to be remitted to thesame or another taxing officerfor taxation.(7) In this rule, \"Judge\" means a Judgein person, and\n\n  \"taxing officer\" means a taxing master, a registrar of the principal probate registry,\n\n  the Admiralty registrar or the registrar of a district registrar.[Words italicised by us]These provisions, with the exception of those words which we have italicised,\n\nwere identical with those of O 59 r 36 of our rules. In fact, our O 59 r 36, which first appeared in\n\nour Rules of the Supreme Court 1970, was derived from these provisions of O 62 r 35.28.    There has been no decision in England pertaining to the\n\ninterpretation and application of O 62 r 35. But there are two decision of the Court of Appeal on a\n\nsimilar rule in the County Court Rules 1981 of England. The first isMadurasinghe v Penguin\n\nElectronics (a firm)[1993] 1 WLR 989. In that case, the solicitors submitted a bill to their\n\nclient for work done in representing him in the county court. The bill was taxed by the district\n\njudge who allowed a sum of 554. The solicitors were dissatisfied with the taxation and applied to\n\nthe district judge to reconsider it However, he upheld it. The solicitors then applied to the judge\n\nfor a review of the taxation under Ord 38 r 24 of the County Court Rules. The judge held that the\n\ndistrict judges taxation could only be interfered with, if he had taken into account irrelevant\n\nconsideration or had failed to take into account relevant consideration or the taxation had been\n\nplainly wrong. Applying that principle the judge dismissed the application. The solicitors appealed\n\nto the Court of Appeal. The court held, inter alia, that the judge was entitled in accordance with\n\nOrd 38 r 24 to exercise all such powers and discretion as were vested in the district judge, and as\n\nsuch had unfettered discretion on hearing of an application for a review of taxation. Ord 38 r 24(4)\n\nand (6) of the County Court Rules 1981 provided respectively as follows:(4) Any party who is dissatisfied with the [district judges] decision on the\n\n  reconsideration may, within 14 days, after being notified of it, apply to the judge to review the\n\n  taxation as to the item or items to which it relates.(6) Unless the judge otherwise directs, no further evidence shall be received\n\n  on the hearing of an application under paragraph (4), and no ground of objection shall be raised\n\n  which has not been raised in the applicants notice, but, save as aforesaid, on the hearing of\n\n  the application the judge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the\n\n  [district judge] in relation to the subject matter of the application.McCowan LJ delivering the main judgment of the court said ([1993] 3 All ER 20 at\n\n23, [1993] 1 WLR 989 at 993):The vital words are \"all such powers and discretion as are vested in the\n\n  registrar in relation to the subject matter of the application\".In my judgment, since\n\n  the registrar and the judge have the same powers and discretion in relation to the subject matter\n\n  of the application, the judges discretion cannot be fettered by the manner in which the\n\n  registrar exercised his discretion. It follows that I consider the judge was plainly wrong in\n\n  believing himself to be bound byHart v Aga Khan Foundation (U.K)[1984] 1 WLR 994 only to\n\n  interfere if he thought that the registrar or district judge had not taken into account something\n\n  he ought to have taken into account or had taken into account an irrelevant matter or that his\n\n  opinion was clearly wrong.29.    The second case isKawarindrasingh v White[1997] 1 All ER 714; [1997] 1 WLR 785. There, the plaintiff brought an action against the defendant for\n\nbreach of contract. He was awarded the costs of two interlocutory applications and submitted a bill\n\nof costs for taxation. The district judge taxed his costs at 67.66 and later on review reconfirmed\n\nthe amount. The plaintiff then sought a review of the taxation by the judge. The judge held that he\n\ncould find no ground for interfering with the decision of the district judge. The plaintiff\n\nappealed. The Court of Appeal held that, on an application for review of taxation of costs, the\n\njudge had, in accordance with Ord 38 r 24(6) of the County Court Rules 1981, all such powers and\n\ndiscretion as were vested in the district judge, and that in that case the judge had misdirected\n\nhimself. The court approved the passage of the judgment of McCowan LJ inMadurasinghewhich\n\nwe have quoted above. Brooke LJ delivering the main judgment of the Court said at p 789:The present application provides an appropriate occasion for this court to\n\n  resolve any doubts which may still linger as to the nature of a judges jurisdiction on an\n\n  application to review a taxation of costs, whether made by a taxing officer or by a district\n\n  judge, and whether made by a firm of solicitors or a litigant in person under R.S.C., Ord. 62, r.\n\n  35(4), or under Ord. 38, r. 24(6) of the Country Court Rules 1981, whose words are identical,\n\n  mutatis mutandis, so far as the provisions relating to the judges powers and discretion are\n\n  concerned. The words, as McCowan L.J. said inMadurasinghe v Penguin Electronics[1993] 1   W.L.R. 989, mean exactly what they say.",
        "Construction of O 59 r 36(4)": "30.    Mr Yang submits that the powers and discretion\n\nconferred on the judge by virtue of r 36(4) should be read subject to r 36(5), which provides that\n\nthe judge may make such order as the circumstances require. We do not follow this argument. Of\n\ncourse the provisions of O 59 r 36 must be read together as a whole, and reading paragraphs (4) and\n\n(5) of r 36 together, we do not see how a judge equipped with the powers and discretion conferred on\n\nhim under r 36(4) can, in making an order in exercise of such powers and discretion, be restricted\n\nor constrained by the general words such order as the circumstances require as found in r\n\n36(5). Each of these paragraphs serves a purpose. Paragraph (4) vests in the judge, on hearing an\n\napplication for review of taxation, the powers and discretion vested in the registrar, and\n\nparagraph (5) empowers the judge in exercising such powers and discretion to make such order as\n\nthe circumstances require. Paragraph (5) complements paragraph (4) and does not restrict or limit\n\nthe latter. It is clear to us that, in bothDiverseyandJeyaretnam,the paragraphs\n\n(4) and (5) of O 59 r 36 were not considered together and no effect was given to paragraph (4). The\n\neffect of these decisions as they stand seems to us to undermine the efficacy or force of paragraph\n\n(4). In our opinion, there is no justification for placing any fetter on the powers and\n\ndiscretion conferred on the judge under O 59 r 36(4); the words there are quite clear that the\n\njudge may exercise all such powers and discretion as are vested in the Registrar. In other\n\nwords, the judge has the same powers and discretion as the registrar in taxing a bill of costs.\n\nNowhere in the entire O 59 r 36 does it say that the judge has a fettered discretion when he reviews\n\nthe taxation of an item or an amount in a bill of costs or that he should not interfere with the\n\nregistrars decision, unless there is an error of principle or some other material error. As Bowen\n\nLJ inGardner v Jay29 Ch.D 50 at 58 said:When a tribunal is invested by Act of Parliament or by Rules with a discretion,\n\n  without any indication in the Act or Rules of the grounds upon which the discretion is to be\n\n  exercised, it is a mistake to lay down any rules with a view of indicating the particular grooves\n\n  in which the discretion should run, for if the Act or the Rules did not fetter the discretion of\n\n  the Judge why should the Court do so?31.    In our judgment, a judge on hearing an application for\n\nreview of taxation of costs under O 59 r 36 hears the matter de novo, and is not fettered by the\n\ndiscretion exercised by the registrar in determining the quantum of any item in the bill under\n\nreview before him. The judge is entitled to exercise the powers and discretion vested in him by the\n\nrules and make a completely fresh decision, among other things, substituting his own discretion for\n\nthat of the registrar and awarding a different figure altogether in place of that awarded by the\n\nregistrar. Of course, in this exercise the judge should give due weight to the registrars\n\ndecision on the quantum that was allowed. For the reasons we have given,DiverseyandJeyaretnam,\n\nin relation to the application of O 59 r 36 of the Rules of Court, were wrongly decided and we\n\ndepart from these decisions which, in so far as they are inconsistent with our decision here, should\n\nnot be followed in the future.32.    Our decision here is consistent with the approach adopted\n\nin cases of appeal to the judge from the decisions of the registrar on assessment of damages:Chang\n\nAh Lek v Lim Ah Koon(supra). What was decided inChang Ah Lekwas reaffirmed by this\n\nCourt inHo Yeow Kim v Lai Hai Kuen and Anor[1999] 2 SLR 246and in the very recent case ofSingapore\n\nAirlines Ltd v Tan Shwu Leng(judgment dated 18 October 2001) (as yet unreported).",
        "Review and appeal": "33.    We now turn to deal with two other arguments raised by Mr\n\nYang. First, he submits that there is a substantive difference in the procedures governing an appeal\n\nfrom the decision of the registrar to a judge, on one hand, and an application for review of\n\ntaxation of a bill of costs by a judge, on the other. An appeal to a judge from the registrars\n\ndecision is governed by O 56 r 1 of the Rules of Courts, and there is only a single decision by the\n\nregistrar before the matter proceeds on appeal to the judge. On the other hand, before a bill of\n\ncosts comes on for review before a judge, the registrar would have made a decision on the bill of\n\ncosts twice; first under O 59 rr 12 and 13 when he taxed the bill, and then under O 59 rr 34 and 35\n\nwhen he carried out a review on the application of the aggrieved party. It follows that when the\n\nbill comes for review before a judge, the party or parties would in fact be having a third bite\n\nof the cherry.34.    We are unable to accept this argument. It is true that\n\nthere is a difference in the procedures between an appeal from the decision of the registrar on a\n\nmatter heard before him and an application to review an item or sum allowed or disallowed by the\n\nregistrar on taxation. But in both cases, the process involved is an appeal from the decision of the\n\nregistrar. It is true also that O 59 r 34 provides an additional procedure for a review of taxation\n\nby the registrar before the matter goes before a judge on review. However, that merely serves to\n\nafford the registrar an opportunity to reconsider the item or amount he allowed or disallowed with a\n\nview to enabling him to correct any errors. We do not see how this extra procedure for review by the\n\nregistrar can afford any ground for saying that the powers and discretion given to a judge in\n\nreviewing the taxation of any item or amount allowed or disallowed by the registrar should be\n\nfettered or in any way restricted.35.    Secondly, Mr Yang submits that the taxation of a bill of\n\ncosts is a matter of practice and procedure, which is wholly distinct from the determination of the\n\nsubstantive rights of the parties by the registrar which later goes by way of an appeal to a judge.\n\nAs a result of this difference, the approach of a judge in an appeal and in a review of taxation of\n\ncosts should be different. He relies on the case ofIn re the Will of FB Gilbert (deceased)\n\n(1946) 46 SR (NSW) 318 at 323, where Jordan CJ said:[T]here is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a\n\n  point of practice or procedure and an exercise of discretion which determines substantive rights.\n\n  In the former class of case, if a tight rein were not kept upon interference with orders of Judges\n\n  of first instance, the result would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice.In addition, counsel submits that the doctrine of unfettered discretion inEvans\n\nv Bartlam(supra) should not be applicable in matters of procedure and practice, because Lord\n\nAtkin, in that case, in declaring the doctrine said ([1937] 2 All ER 646 at 648-649, [1937] AC 473\n\nat 478):I wish to state my conviction that where there is a discretionary\n\n  jurisdiction given to the Court or a judge the judge in chambers is in no way fettered by the\n\n  previous exercise of the Masters discretion. His own discretion is intended bythe rules\n\n  to determine the parties rights: and he is entitled to exercise it as though the\n\n  matter came before him for the first time. He will, of course, give the weight it deserves to the\n\n  previous decision of the Master : but he is in no way bound by it. This in my experience has\n\n  always been the practice in Chambers, and I am glad to find it confirmed by the recent decision of\n\n  the Court of Appeal inCooper v Cooper(I), with which I entirely agree. [Emphasis is that\n\n  of counsel]36.    The short answer to this argument is that the process of\n\ntaxation of costs is not a matter of practice or procedure. The manner of how a bill of costs after\n\ntaxation by the taxing officer may be brought to a judge for a review may be a matter of procedure,\n\nbut the process of taxation itself is not one of procedure; it is a determination by the taxing\n\nofficer of the amount or amounts which one party is to pay to the other. It is a matter affecting\n\nthe substantive rights of the parties.37.    Secondly, the above passage fromIn re the Will of FB\n\nGilbert (deceased)cited by counsel is of no assistance to him in support of his submission. To\n\nillustrate this point, we need only to set out a fuller passage of Jordan CJs judgment at\n\npp 322-323:Next, it was said that for the applicant, that, since by s 3 the question\n\n  whether any and if so how much provision should be made for an applicant is in terms left to the\n\n  discretion of the Court, it is only in the most exceptional circumstances that aCourt of\n\n  Appealcould regard itself as justified in interfering with the exercise of a discretion\n\n  by a judge of first instance  only where he has misapplied the law, or his order is likely to\n\n  lead to a miscarriage of justice :Evans v Bartlam[1937] AC 437 at 480-1, 486-7  there\n\n  is a material difference between an exercise of discretion on a point of practice or procedure and\n\n  an exercise of discretion which determined substantive rights. In the former class of case, if a\n\n  tight rein were not kept upon interference with the orders of Judges of first instance, the result\n\n  would be disastrous to the proper administration of justice. The disposal of cases could be\n\n  delayed interminably, and costs heaped up indefinitely, if a litigant with a long purse or a\n\n  litigious disposition could, at will, in effect transfer all exercises of discretion in\n\n  interlocutory applicationsfrom a Judge in chambers to a Court of Appeal.[Emphasis\n\n  is ours]It is obvious that Jordan CJ was actually referring to the Court of Appeals\n\nrestraint in interfering with the exercise of discretion of a judge in chambers, especially in\n\nprocedural matters. No doubt, it is settled law that an appellate court is particularly slow to\n\ninterfere with the exercise of discretion of a trial judge. The decision relied upon by counsel is\n\ntotally inappropriate.38.    Lastly, the pronouncement of Lord Atkin inEvans v\n\nBartlam(supra) relied upon by Mr Yang cannot be said to be confined to instances where the\n\nappeal from the registrar to the judge involves only substantive rights and not rights of a\n\nprocedural nature. There is nothing in that pronouncement to restrict the parties rights to\n\nonly substantive rights. No such distinction was contemplated in the speech of Lord Atkin. In our\n\nopinion, it is not correct to say that the pronouncement made by Lord Atkin inEvans v Bartlamis\n\nnot applicable to a judge hearing an appeal from the decision of the registrar on a matter\n\nconcerning practice and procedure.",
        "Quantum": "39.    We now turn to the question of quantum. On this issue, we\n\nshould first clarify a point with regard to the bill of costs submitted by the 17 defendants for\n\ntaxation. Both counsel for Mr Tan and counsel for the 17 defendants have now clarified that the bill\n\nwas made out on the basis that 100% of the costs would be allowed. Therefore, on the basis of the\n\nagreement reached with Mr Tan, the 17 defendants would be entitled to be paid an amount equal to 80%\n\nof the costs as taxed. It follows that, for every item of the bill allowed, only 80% thereof would\n\nbe payable by Mr Tan to the defendants. So in this case, if $100,000 is to be allowed for section 1\n\nof the bill as allowed by the judge, Mr Tan will be required to pay only $80,000.40.    We now turn to consider the quantum of $100,000 allowed by\n\nthe judge. In dealing with this question it is relevant to go further and consider the grounds on\n\nwhich the assistant registrar allowed the amount of $70,000. At the initial stage, when she allowed\n\nthe amount of $100,000, she bore in mind the following matters which were discussed in  3 of her\n\ngrounds of decision:(3) Although the action involved multiple defendants who were represented by\n\n  three different sets of solicitors, and although counsel for the Defendants asserted that some 500\n\n  hours had been spent on getting up, the factual and legal issues in dispute did not appear to be\n\n  complex. In essence, they centred on the question of whether the alleged acts of irregularity\n\n  amounted to a breach of the applicable rules relating to the election so as to vitiate the\n\n  election process or its results. The trial was also not document-heavy. When the action, which was\n\n  commenced by way of an originating summons, was converted to a writ of action, no pleadings were\n\n  ordered to be filed, and neither did parties have to prepare additional affidavits or undergo the\n\n  usual discovery process. This was because the bulk of the affidavit and documentary evidence had\n\n  already been tendered during the hearing of the Plaintiffs application for an interim\n\n  injunction restraining the 2ndto the 34thDefendants from acting as the 1stDefendants Management Committee.41.    She then said that on those grounds she allowed the sum of\n\n$100,000. But on review, she heard further arguments from counsel. Having considered these\n\narguments, which she briefly set out in her grounds of decision, she reduced the amount to $70,000.\n\nShe was obviously persuaded by the arguments advanced on behalf of Mr Tan, which she rehearsed as\n\nfollows:7 .. The bulk of the allegations of irregularity were directed principally\n\n  at only 5 out of the 34 defendants. More importantly, counsel for the Plaintiff pointed out that\n\n  there had been a considerable degree of overlap between the work done by the different sets of\n\n  solicitors for the Defendants, not least where the cross-examination of some of the Plaintiffs\n\n  witnesses and the preparation of the Bundle of Authorities were concerned.We think that this is a highly relevant consideration in determining the amount\n\nto be allowed.42.    Turning to the judgment of the judge, we find that none of\n\nthe matters discussed by the assistant registrar were considered by the judge. In his judgment, the\n\njudge said at  20:20. In connection with this, there were certain significant features which bore\n\n  upon the work done. First, the choice of putting the 34 defendants through the mill was made by\n\n  the plaintiff. The defendants came from different education backgrounds. Next as the plaintiff put\n\n  it, the matter incurred \"the benefit of the Hainanese community\". In other words it was\n\n  not a run of the mill claim. In the event, what was in issue was reputation of the parties and\n\n  partly high emotion. Indeed fraud and theft of ballot papers became part of the case. The\n\n  plaintiff himself retained an eminent senior as his advocate and the senior counsel was assisted\n\n  by a team of lawyers. In the circumstances it was reasonable and proper for the 17 defendants to\n\n  seek separate representation. This would necessarily involve consultation with all the 17\n\n  defendants. There would inevitably be some overlap and joint work. That does not mean there was no\n\n  separate preparation for the 17 defendants.43.    It seems to us that some of the matters considered by the\n\njudge, with respect, are not quite relevant in relation to the question of the appropriate quantum\n\nto be allowed. First, joining 34 defendants may be a necessity in the proceedings; second, the fact\n\nthat the defendants came from different backgrounds has no relevance on the issue of the quantum;\n\nthird, the fact that the matter was incurred for the benefit of the Hananese community is\n\nagain irrelevant; and lastly, the fact that the reputation of the parties was involved and the\n\nmatter generated high emotion is also not relevant.44.    It may be reasonable for the 17 defendants to have a legal\n\nrepresentation separate from those of the Association and the remaining defendants, as the judge\n\nheld. That having said, we think that there must be considerable areas, where the works carried out\n\nby the different sets of solicitors or counsel were common to all and were carried out jointly or in\n\nconsultation with each other. In other words, there must be considerable overlap in the various\n\nmatters dealt with in the defences to the claim resulting in the same work being carried out by the\n\nrespective solicitors or counsel. Therefore, the load on each of the solicitors or counsel was\n\nlightened. Bearing this in mind, we think that a reasonable discount should be allowed for the\n\nseparate fee awarded to each set of solicitors or counsel. Having regard to this factor and all the\n\nrelevant circumstances, we think that the sum of $70,000 allowed by the assistant registrar was fair\n\nand reasonable. It should not be forgotten that this is only the bill of costs of the 17 defendants,\n\nand that there are two other bills of costs to follow: one by the 1stdefendant, the\n\nAssociation, and the other by the remaining defendants. The total amount eventually to be paid by Mr\n\nTan and those whom he represents to all the defendants would well exceed $100,000.",
        "Conclusion": "45.    In conclusion, we allow the appeal, set aside the amount of\n\n$100,000 allowed by the judge and reinstate the amount of $70,000 allowed by the assistant\n\nregistrar.",
        "Costs": "46.    We now come to the question of costs. First the costs\n\nbefore the judge. The judge ordered Mr Tan to pay the costs of the hearing before him, which he\n\nfixed at $1,500. That order we set aside, and if that amount or any part thereof had been paid by Mr\n\nTan, we order that it be refunded. Mr Tan should have his costs before the judge. As the judge had\n\nfixed costs at $1,500, we would adopt this amount and fix the costs at $1,500 to be paid by the\n\nrespondents.47.    Next, the costs of the appeal. Although Mr Tan has\n\nsucceeded in this appeal, his arguments on the various points failed. Even on the quantum he did not\n\nreally focus on the points on which we have allowed the appeal. In the circumstances, we would not\n\nallow him the full costs of the appeal. He should be allowed only 30% of the costs of the appeal,\n\nand we so order. There will be the usual consequential order for the refund to Mr Tan or his\n\nsolicitors of the deposit in court, with interest, if any.Sgd:Sgd:Sgd:YONG PUNG HOWL P THEANLAI KEW CHAIChief JusticeJudge of AppealJudgeCopyright © Government of Singapore."
