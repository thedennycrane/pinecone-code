        "Statements of the Accused": "8.    The accused did not dispute the voluntariness of\n\nthe 2 statements he had given to the police. Both his statements were accordingly admitted\n\ninto evidence. In the first cautioned statement, he said:I have no intention of taking the revolver. At that moment I just grab\n\n  it. On the same day I placed the revolver in a dustbin somewhere near Block 335 or Blk 355\n\n  Clementi Ave 2 after which I call the police at about 5 to 6 p.m. I call the police twice\n\n  for this matter. When I was arrested I did not put up any struggle.9.    At paragraphs 8 to 11 of his long statement\n\nrecorded on 12 October 1999, he related the following details:8. When I got up of the ground, the male police officer grabbed my\n\n  shirt and pinned me sideway to the wall. Both the police officers then took out their\n\n  handcuffs and wanted to handcuff me. Both of them were trying to hold on to my hands\n\n  wanting to handcuff me. I refused to let them handcuff me and swing both my hands wildly\n\n  at them and trying to push them away. I turned around and wanted to grab hold of the\n\n  female police officer’s gun.9. I placed both of my hands at the butt of the gun and tried to pull\n\n  it out of the holster. The woman police officer shouted at me and also used both her hands\n\n  to hold on to her gun. I tried to pull out the gun by jerking the gun forcefully upwards\n\n  but it was unsuccessful. I then gave up and released my grip on her gun. I pushed her down\n\n  on the ground.10. I turned around faced the male police officer. I then went to grab\n\n  the male police officer’s gun. When I was grabbing the male police officer’s\n\n  gun, he used his handcuff to hit on my hand. He was also retreating backwards and I step\n\n  forward each time he retreated. He retreated about 7 steps and I pulled forcefully his gun\n\n  upwards from his holster and the gun came out of the holster. At the same time, I pushed\n\n  the male police officer down to the ground. As the police officer was falling to the\n\n  ground, I continued to pull the gun backwards and the string that was attached to the gun\n\n  snapped.11. I then pointed the gun at both the police officer and asked them\n\n  not to force me. I also asked them let me free. I saw the woman police officer talking\n\n  into the walkie-talkie. I then walked away from both of them. They did not give chase and\n\n  just stood there. After a distance I put the gun at my waist inside my T-shirt. I was\n\n  still wearing my T-shirt. I walked towards Blk 25 Hougang Ave 3……..10.    The accused further stated in his long statement\n\nthat he was eventually persuaded by Ah Siong and his wife to surrender the gun. Ah Siong\n\nsuggested that he put the gun at the rubbish bin near Clementi Police Station and he\n\nagreed. At about 6 p.m. on that day, the accused and his wife left for Clementi. They\n\nalighted near the Clementi Police Station. They walked to Block 335 Clementi Ave 2. The\n\naccused found a plastic bag and some newspapers. He unloaded the 5 rounds of ammunition\n\nfrom the gun. He wrapped the gun and the bullets with newspapers and placed them into a\n\nplastic bag. He tied up the plastic bag and threw it into a rubbish bin near a lift\n\nlanding. The accused unloaded the gun as he was afraid the gun might misfire if he threw\n\nit into the rubbish bin. After that, he and his wife walked towards Blk 350 Clementi Ave\n\n2. The accused then called the police from one of the public phones at the void deck and\n\ninformed the police that he had left the revolver inside the rubbish bin at Blk 335\n\nClementi Ave 2. The revolver and 5 rounds of ammunition were later recovered by the\n\npolice.11.    Insp Yong Chow Yniap of the Force Armament Branch\n\nof the Singapore Police examined the revolver and found it to be in fully serviceable\n\ncondition.12.    Dr Francis Ngui, an associate consultant at\n\nWoodbridge Hospital, had examined the accused on various occasions. In his opinion, the\n\naccused suffered from heroin dependence and atypical psychosis. In his view, these\n\npsychotic symptoms were most likely related to the accused’s past heroin and sedative\n\nabuse. Dr Francis Ngui was of the opinion that the accused was mentally fit to stand trial\n\nand to plead, and that he was not of unsound mind at the time of the alleged offence as he\n\nknew the nature and quality of his acts.",
        "Close of Prosecution’s Case": "13.    At the close of the prosecution’s case, I\n\nfound that a prima facie case was made out against the accused. Accordingly, I called the\n\naccused to give evidence in his own defence. The accused elected to give evidence.Evidence of the Accused14.    The accused related how he came into possession\n\nof the drugs. He confirmed that he was stopped by the 2 police constables who wanted to\n\ncheck his identity card. The male police officer asked him why he was there and he told\n\nthem that he was buying 4-D tickets. After screening his identity card and finding that he\n\nwas not on the wanted list, the female officer told him that she wanted to check his sling\n\nbag. Since their screening had confirmed that he was not on the wanted list, he asked her\n\nwhy she still wanted to check his sling bag. He knew that he had drugs with him. If he was\n\narrested again for the drugs, it would be his third time that he would be charged with\n\ndrug possession. He wanted to run away. So he ran off to Block 3 where he threw the drugs\n\naway. He then ran up the stairs but he fell. The male officer approached him from behind\n\nand tried to pull him down the staircase. After pulling him down to the ground, the male\n\nofficer used his baton to hit his legs and hands.15.    When he was lying on the ground, the female\n\nofficer kicked him with her legs. The male officer pulled him up and pushed him to the\n\nwall in order to handcuff him. The accused said that he managed to struggle free but he\n\nfound himself blocked by the female officer and was not able to run away. Suddenly he came\n\nupon an idea to frighten the female officer by pulling out her revolver.16.    Whilst he was tugging at the female\n\nofficer’s revolver, the male officer used his handcuffs to hit him. He gave up trying\n\nto pull out the female officer’s revolver and turned to the male officer instead.\n\nWhen he turned towards the male officer, his hand happened to come into contact with the\n\nmale officer’s revolver. Instinctively, he grabbed hold of the male officer’s\n\nrevolver and began tugging at it. When the male officer retreated a few steps and was\n\nabout to fall, the accused managed to pull out the revolver.17.    The accused said that he was very frightened at\n\nthat time. He did not expect himself to go to the extent of grabbing hold of the police\n\nofficer’s revolver. But the revolver was already in his hand. He then placed his hand\n\ndown and pointed the gun at the ground. He admitted that he had told the male officer\n\n\"not to force him anymore\" or \"not to come any more\". When he looked\n\nup, he saw the female officer but did not say anything to her. He then turned to look at\n\nthe male officer and thereafter, retreated a few steps. Before he left, he was pointing\n\nthe gun in a downward direction. Basically, he never pointed the gun directly at either of\n\nthe police constables. He proceeded to walk to Block 1. Subsequently, he concealed the\n\nrevolver underneath his T-shirt. He also related the evidence that led him to place the\n\nrevolver and the ammunition in the dustbin. He said that he telephoned the police to tell\n\nthem where he had placed the revolver. The accused testified that he did not surrender\n\nimmediately because he wanted to consume heroin, which he did when he spent the night at\n\nBlk 315, Hougang. On the next morning, the accused realised that there were many plain\n\nclothes police officers tailing him. He decided to surrender himself to them. He was then\n\narrested.18.    In his cross-examination, the accused admitted\n\nthat his intention of snatching the revolver was to prevent Cpl Brian from chasing him.\n\nHowever, it did not occur to him how he was going to use the gun to stop Cpl Brian from\n\nchasing him. He said that Cpl Brian was on the ground and he knew that Cpl Brian would not\n\nbe able to prevent him from running away. The accused explained that there was therefore\n\nno necessity for him to hold the revolver with both his hands and point it at Cpl Brian.\n\nHe maintained that he never pointed the revolver directly at Cpl Brian although he\n\nconceded that the revolver was in Cpl Brian’s line of vision when Cpl Brian turned\n\nhis head around to look at him.19.    With regard to the question whether he had\n\npointed the revolver at W/Cpl Florence, the accused said that he was not sure if the\n\nrevolver was pointed in her direction. The accused demonstrated by lifting his right arm\n\nalmost parallel to the ground. The gun was then in his right hand. The accused said that\n\nhe was swinging his right arm in that manner and in that angle. However, during his second\n\ndemonstration, he lifted his arm upwards, not to the front of himself, but to his side and\n\nhis head was facing away from the gun.20.    It would appear from his evidence that he simply\n\nhad no intention to point the gun in the direction of W/Cpl Florence. The gun might have\n\nbeen pointed at her inadvertently as he was swinging his body and his arm whilst he was\n\nturning his body around. When he was asked by the learned DPP why he had stated in his\n\npolice statement that he had pointed the gun at both police officers, the accused\n\nexplained that he had told the investigating officer that he was not sure of the direction\n\nin which he had pointed his revolver. As he was uncertain, the investigating officer\n\ninformed him that the 2 police officers were there. As such, it was as if he were pointing\n\nthe revolver at them because he had pointed the gun in the direction where the police\n\nofficers were. The accused said that he was very frightened at that time and his intention\n\nwas to leave the scene as soon as possible. Thus, he was not sure where he was aiming the\n\nrevolver. When asked what he meant when he told Cpl Brian not to force him any further,\n\nthe accused said that there was a possibility of Cpl Brian retrieving his revolver from\n\nhim and in the ensuing struggle, accidental harm could be caused to them or to any\n\npasser-by.21.    The accused denied telling W/Cpl Florence not to\n\nmove. When he again denied having pointed the revolver at Cpl Brian, I then asked him\n\nwhether he had lowered the gun in his hand all the way down, to point it directly at the\n\nground. The accused disclosed that he was not pointing the gun directly at the ground but\n\nwas pointing the gun somewhere towards his right and that was where Cpl Brian was lying.22.    From this evidence, I inferred that his act of\n\npointing the gun in the direction of Cpl Brian was deliberate and intentional. The accused\n\nsaid that he did not know how long he was doing that. But in the course of doing so, he\n\ndid tell Cpl Brian not to force him any further. The accused further admitted that as he\n\nwas leaving, he turned his body and swung his arm holding the gun somewhere to his chest\n\nlevel. At first, the accused testified that he did swing the gun to his chest level past\n\nthe location where W/Cpl Florence was, and that the gun would not be pointing above her\n\nhead as he swung the gun pass her position. When asked whether the gun would then be\n\npointed at the level of her chest, the accused retracted his earlier testimony and said\n\nthat he was not sure now. He said he could not be positive whether in the course of his\n\nturning around, the revolver had pointed above the female police officer’s head or at\n\nher chest region. In any event, the accused admitted that both police constables did not\n\nmove. He could even see that Cpl Brian was shivering and his lips were quivering. These to\n\nmy mind were obvious manifestations of Cpl Brian’s extreme fear at the time when the\n\naccused was pointing the gun at him. It lent credence to Cpl Brian’s and W/Cpl\n\nFlorence’s evidence that the accused had indeed pointed the gun directly at Cpl Brian\n\nwhilst he was lying on the ground.",
        "Findings": "23.    I found that the charge against the accused had\n\nbeen proved beyond a reasonable doubt. I believed the evidence of the two police\n\nconstables that the accused had pointed the gun directly at Cpl Brian in a menacing\n\nfashion and had threatened him not to come any closer. Just before he retreated, he had\n\nalso pointed the gun in the direction of W/Cpl Florence and told her not to move. The\n\nseriousness with which he had uttered those words in Hokkien was not lost on these two\n\npolice constables who therefore stopped pursuing the accused lest he should use the gun\n\nagainst them. I disbelieved the accused’s evidence that he never pointed the gun at\n\neither of the police constables or that any pointing of the gun at W/Cpl Florence was\n\nmerely accidental because he happened to swing his body and his arm around past her\n\ndirection as he was moving away. I accepted the learned DPP’s submission that it was\n\nmost unbelievable that the accused, who was desperately trying to escape, would choose not\n\nto use the revolver, which he had tried so hard to take in the first place, to deter these\n\ndetermined officers from further pursuing and arresting him in the course of their duty. I\n\nwas fully satisfied that the accused was completely aware of the nature and quality of his\n\nactions at the material time. He was in full control of his faculties. His ability to\n\nrelate with surprising clarity his version of the incident during his testimony in court\n\nconfirmed the conclusions reached by Dr Francis Ngui, which I accepted.24.    As such, I found that the accused had threatened\n\nthe police constables with injury to their persons, and this was intended to stop them\n\nfrom chasing and apprehending him, which these two police constables were entitled to do.\n\nClearly the accused had committed criminal intimidation under s 506 of the Penal Code,\n\nwhich is a scheduled offence under the Arms Offences Act, Chapter 14. Since he had with\n\nhim a Smith & Wesson revolver at the time of the commission of that scheduled offence,\n\nI found the accused guilty of the offence as charged. Accordingly, I convicted him.",
        "Sentence": "25.    The sentence prescribed for the offence is life\n\nimprisonment and a minimum of 6 strokes of the cane. Having considered the accused’s\n\nmitigation (which was in his closing submissions) and his antecedents which were mainly\n\ndrug-related, and having regard to the rest of the charges which the accused admitted and\n\nconsented to be taken into consideration for the purpose of sentencing, it was appropriate\n\nin my view that he be given 12 strokes of the cane. I noted that one of the charges taken\n\ninto consideration was under section 394 of the Penal Code, where he had committed robbery\n\nof the revolver in the possession of Cpl Brian and in the course of committing that\n\nrobbery, he had voluntarily caused hurt to Cpl Brian. This offence carries with it a\n\npunishment of caning with no less than 12 strokes. Accordingly, I sentenced him to\n\nimprisonment for life and 12 strokes of the cane.Dated this 20th day of April, 2000.CHAN SENG ONNJudicial CommissionerCopyright © Government of Singapore."
