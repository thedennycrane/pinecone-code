        "Central issue of smuggling": "18 I turn now, first and foremost, to the central issue whether the plaintiffs\n\nhad, as the defendants had alleged, participated or colluded in the smuggling or were they in any\n\nway implicated in the smuggling. The resolution of this issue will dispose of the issues whether the\n\nplaintiffs are precluded from suing on the Agreement on the ground of their illegal act as a matter\n\npublic policy and on the question whether the Agreement could be rescinded by the defendants on the\n\nground that the plaintiffs, who had been implicated in the smuggling, had fraudulently or\n\nnegligently made material misrepresentations to the defendants which induced the defendants to enter\n\ninto the Agreement with them. As mentioned earlier, the defendants under this defence seek the\n\nalternative remedy equivalent to the sums and interest paid back. If the finding of this court is\n\nthat the plaintiffs had not participated, colluded or were not in any way implicated in the\n\nsmuggling, then it follows that the plaintiffs are not precluded from suing under the Agreement;\n\nthey will then not be affected by any wilful misconduct or illegal and public policy considerations\n\ndo not arise. It will also follow that the defendants are not entitled to rescind the Agreement or\n\nkeep the damages to set off the claim for the return of the sum and interest repaid. In my view, the\n\nIsraeli judgments were in personam and not in rem which the defendants could rely as a bar. Further,\n\nthe contest of the issue of smuggling is not an abuse of process. It is the defendants who are\n\nalleging that the plaintiffs were implicated in the smuggling. They make it central to their case\n\nbefore this court.",
        "My Findings": "19 Having heard the evidence, both documentary and oral, and after carefully\n\nevaluating them, I have come to the conclusion that in truth and in fact the plaintiffs had not\n\nparticipated or colluded in the smuggling and they were not, in my judgment, implicated in any way\n\nin the smuggling: see the requirement for higher evidentiary standard proof inYogambikai\n\nNagarajah v Indian Overseas Bank[1997] 1 SLR 258,Sumitomo Bank Ltd v Kartika Ratna Thahir[1993] 1 SLR 735andOng & Co Pte Ltd v Quah Kay Tee[1996] 2 SLR 553. The plaintiffs did not\n\nadduce evidence of a compelling and convincing nature. I believe Bhojwani was telling the truth.20 The plaintiffs are part of the well-known Shankar Group of companies. In\n\nSingapore, the Group is one of the leading exporters of electronic goods. They are broadly speaking\n\npart of the businesses of the Bhojwani clan, which were set up in 1946. For almost 40 years the\n\nplaintiffs, their predecessors in commercial substance, and their Group have insured with the\n\ndefendants who were previously known as United India Insurance. Since 1981 the plaintiffs have\n\ntraded primarily in consumer electronic goods in the world markets and they cover Asia, Middle East,\n\nAfrica, the Mediterranean, the Caribbean, the C.I.S., U.S.A and Latin America. In the course of\n\ntheir trade they receive orders from their worldwide contacts. One of them, who feature in the\n\ntransaction in question, is Frontscope Limited (\"Frontscope\") of United Kingdom.\n\nFrontscope had gone into liquidation. Their managing director, Shandip Popat (\"Popat\"),\n\ndealt with Bhojwani in the transaction in question from beginning to end. He gave evidence before\n\nme. The plaintiffs traded with Frontscope in a variety of ways so far as payment for the goods was\n\nconcerned: payments could be by letters of credit, documents against payment (DP terms) basis or on\n\nan open account basis. The last mode of trading and payment, I understood, meant that they kept a\n\nrunning account between them in relation to their transactions. Remittances sent by Frontscope would\n\nbe appropriated wholly to a transaction or a combination of transactions. This mode of payment also\n\nallowed for a requirement of upfront payment if Bhojwani thought it necessary to protect the\n\ninterest of the plaintiffs.21 The plaintiffs have a network of suppliers of electronic goods. Among them\n\nwere Asia Matsushita, Philips, Singapore and World Audio, a local J.V.C. export agent. These\n\nsuppliers obtain their supplies from the manufacturers directly and they sell to exporters such as\n\nthe plaintiffs. As for stuffing the goods into containers and the tallying of the quantity of goods\n\nstuffed these jobs were sub-contracted by the plaintiffs to Anglo-Offshore Shipping (\"AOS\").22 In early November 1990 Bhojwani received a call from Popat asking for the\n\nsupply of a relatively large consignment of video cassette recorders and colour television sets of\n\nvarious description and make. As confirmed by Popat in evidence and by a fax erroneously dated 26\n\nNovember 1990, when in fact Popat sent it out on 24 November, 1990, Popat informed Bhojwani that\n\nthere was an Israeli customer who was willing to place a deposit of US$50,000 for the shipment. Upon\n\nshipment, the customer would pay in full and the plaintiffs were to forward the set of original\n\nbills of lading to Popat to take delivery. The goods were to be described as 2 x 20 ft or 1 x 40 ft\n\ncontainer load of videos of National/Panasonic (N/P) of the stated descriptive details, and\n\ntelevisions of 14\" infra-red T.V. JVC, Sharp, N/P or Toshiba make.23 On 26 November 1990 the plaintiffs confirmed in writing to Frontscope that the\n\nfollowing stocks had been reserved for them:\"800 sets NV-L 15 Sen800 sets/20 CTNR600 sets HR-1540600 sets/20 CTNR700 sets C-1480M350 sets/20 CTNR24 Bhojwani phoned Popat and told him that plaintiffs had to confirm to their\n\nsuppliers by 5.30 p.m. Singapore time. As stated in the plaintiffs fax of 28 November 1990 the\n\norder of the said goods was confirmed. The plaintiffs stipulated that they required the deposit of\n\nUS$100,000 to defray banking charges, re-shipment costs, losses in foreign exchange and fall in the\n\nmarket prices of the goods in case the ultimate buyer failed to take delivery of the goods. This was\n\na sensible and normal precaution where the consignment was on DP terms. Popat was himself based in\n\nLondon and not Israel and Popat was relying on a third party buyer who was unknown to the plaintiffs\n\nand Bhojwani.25 On 27 November 1990 Frontscope wrote to the plaintiffs advising the remittance\n\nof DM41,000 (equivalent to US$28,000). On the following day, Bhojwani sent a fax to Frontscope\n\nstating that one Wrobel had placed with them US28,000 and not US$29,000 which Popat had earlier\n\nindicated to Bhojwani. I accept Bhojwanis evidence that he had no contact with Wrobel. He was, as\n\nconfirmed by Popat in the witness stand, the one who approached Popat for the shipment. In this\n\ntrade, it was usual and only to be expected that intermediaries do not disclose the identity and\n\ncontact details of their intermediaries or customers. In response, Popat informed Bhojwani that his\n\ncustomer wanted the goods to be exported in containers that were purchased and shipment was to be\n\nvia Trieste (Italy) through a non-Israeli shipping line. A few days later, Frontscope enquired about\n\nthe price of two 40 foot containers, how long it would take to purchase them and to ship the goods.\n\nOn 5 December 1990 the plaintiffs replied that each container cost US$2,100.00 and that the purchase\n\nand shipment could be effected immediately.26 By a fax of 5 December 1990 sent to Frontscope the plaintiffs confirmed the\n\npurchase of the two containers and the shipment of the goods to Trieste (Italy). The Bills of Lading\n\nwould state the plaintiffs as the shippers, that they are to be delivered to the order of the\n\nplaintiffs and the Notify Party was to be left blank. Frontscope was further informed that upon the\n\narrival of the vessel in Trieste, their customer would have to make payment and take custody of the\n\noriginal bills of lading. Once the customer had paid for and received the original bills of lading,\n\nthe customer could take the containers in Trieste and ship the goods to Ashdod at his convenience\n\nand prepare his documentation in a manner acceptable to him.27 Bhojwani attended to two urgent matters on 6 December 1990. The plaintiffs had\n\nto take delivery of the goods and ship them by Sat/Sunday 7 or 8 December or substantial warehousing\n\ncharges would be incurred. He also pressed for the remittance of US470,0000 being the balance of the\n\ndeposit. When pressed, Popat said that he was himself waiting for instructions.28 On 6 December 1990 Frontscope gave written shipping instructions. They wanted\n\nthe shipment to Ashdod directly as soon as possible. They confirmed the purchase of the two\n\ncontainers which, however, were not to be an Israeli line. They asked the plaintiffs to pay the\n\nfreight and bill it. The Bill of Lading should show quantity and model L15SEN, C1480 and HR1540.\n\nThere was to be no mention of the TVs or Videos. There should be no value on the Bill of Lading.\n\nPopat instructed the plaintiffs to hold on to the Bills of Lading till he informed them.29 Bhojwani made his enquiries and found that the vessel to Ashdod was fully\n\nbooked. The shipment was put on the waiting list. He also informed Frontscope that the shipping line\n\nrequired the consignee to be identified as the shipping line was suspicious of any bill of lading\n\nmade out \"TO ORDER\" as this could suggest that the order had not been finalised and there\n\nwas a risk of cancellation in a tight shipping market. Popat of Frontscope responded in writing and\n\ngave the details of the Notify Party as \"Alfa Electronic Arkon 15 Ramat-Gan Israel\". It\n\nturned out that this was a non-existent entity. But there was no way for Bhojwani to know. For that\n\nmatter, on the evidence, Popat took the word of one Wrobel for it.30 On 7 December 1990 the plaintiffs wrote to Frontscope setting out the bill as\n\nUS$597,500. It included the freight and they asked Frontscope for the details of the Telegraphic\n\nTransfer. Three days later, plaintiffs sent a chaser for the remittance of US$70,000 which was not\n\nreceived. Bhojwani was personally concerned by the lack of remittance and he pressed Popat who\n\neventually agreed to be personally liable for the balance of the US$70,000. A week later, Frontscope\n\nsent the remittance of30,000 and Popat indicated in a fax that it was for the deposit of\n\nUS$70,000.31 An error occurred in the issue of the plaintiffs invoice to Alfa\n\nElectronic. This was seized upon by the defendants as evidence of the linkage between the plaintiffs\n\nand the smugglers and their complicity. But there was in fact nothing in it. It was simply an error\n\non the part of the clerk of the plaintiffs who typed the invoice erroneously thinking that the\n\nNotify Party was also the contracting party. This was in fact noticed and rectified when the bill\n\namongst collection documents, including the bills of lading, could not be processed by the London\n\nbankers of Frontscope. Bhojwani was overseas at the relevant time and he was not consulted on the\n\ncorrect entries. The invoice to Frontscope was issued for US$538,838.00 to take into account the\n\nremittance of US$62,862.00 in US currency, which was the money of account. When the error was\n\ndiscovered a swift message was sent to Hambros Bank via the plaintiffs bankers, Banque Nationale\n\nde Paris (\"BNP\"). Much was made of this error by the defendants. Again, it was one of\n\nthose errors that could happen and it did. So far as the remittance of the deposit was concerned,\n\nthe contemporaneous documents proved the remittances of DM41,470 on 27 November 1990 and 30,000\n\nwere appropriated to the contract for the electronic goods. On 16 January 1991 Frontscope paid the\n\nfurther sum of 20,000 and this sum was appropriated in part for this contract and in part for\n\nother contracts.32 I turn to the supply of the goods. The consignment of 700 cartons JVC\n\ntelevisions was loaded at World Audios warehouse at Ubi Road on 12 December 1990. An employee of\n\nAOS, Murugaya Manickam, told the court that the container was stuffed and sealed at Ubi Road under\n\nhis supervision. The other consignment was loaded under the supervision of Lim Joo Kiang at Shankars\n\nEmporium warehouse at 80 Teck Guan Street. So far as the JVC videos were concerned they were\n\nreceived on 13 December 1990 and shipped out on the same day.33 At all material times, the position of the plaintiffs was fully secured. They\n\nsent the shipping documents to BNP for collection and these were sent to Hambros Bank. Popat would\n\nonly be issued the set of original bills of lading if Frontscope paid and the plaintiffs were\n\ncredited by Hambros Bank. On top of that, they had the upfront deposit which was substantial, though\n\nnot the entire sum. As explained by Popat, Wrobel had to turn up in London with his customer and him\n\nand hand over the cash to Hambros Bank who would release the shipping documents and the set of\n\noriginal bills of lading. Frontscope would accept the bills of the plaintiffs only if they had been\n\npaid the price and charges.34 On 9 January 1991 Frontscope returned the shipping documents as they were not\n\nable to pay on the bills. They instructed Hambros Bank to return the original documents to BNP, the\n\nplaintiffs bankers. It was done. The plaintiffs telexed Zim Lines requesting the return of the\n\ncontainers. There was no response. Bhojwani informed Frontscope that the goods had not arrived\n\nsafely. Popat at that stage told him that the customers name was one Dan E. Ycheskel (\"Ycheskel\")\n\nand that he owned Alfa Electronics. He passed on this information from Wrobel to Bhojwani. Later,\n\nPopat said that Wrobels customer was Avi Cohen whom he had never met. He had transacted with\n\nWrobel previously.35 By 16 January 1991 the plaintiffs had not received any news about the goods\n\nnor the balance of the price of the goods. They instructed Khattar Wong & Partners (\"KWP\")\n\nto act on their behalf. Israeli lawyers Messrs Zadok Striks (\"Zadok\") were instructed to\n\nhandle the matters in Israel. Zadok reported the removal of the goods and the smuggling activities\n\nof the three individuals, including Avi Cohen, who were known as the \"Polish gang\". In\n\nresponse to lawyers enquiries the plaintiff had as early as 8 February 1991 stated that they sold\n\nthe goods to Frontscope who sold them to a company in Israel. They further explained that the\n\nshipping line wanted the name of the Notify Party and on their enquiry Frontscope told advised them\n\nin writing that it was Alfa Electronics Ltd.36 As stated earlier, the plaintiffs claimed under the All Risk marine cargo\n\npolicy but liability was not admitted. The customs authorities insisted that they had a right to\n\nauction off the goods. The plaintiffs therefore applied to the Israeli court for an interim\n\ninjunction. The hearing took place on 1 May 1991. Bhojwani testified. But Bachar had him detained\n\nfor interrogation over two days. Amazingly, he was compelled to surrender the original bills of\n\nlading to the customs authorities. Up to the date of the hearing, the plaintiffs had not been able\n\nto recover those documents of title. Bachar took a long statement from Bhojwani. The plaintiffs\n\nfailed to stop the auction and recover the goods because had informed the court of highly\n\nprejudicial but doubtfully probative materials involving what a \"snitcher\" had told him.\n\nAccording to established practice, I heard in confidence what he said to me to respect the wishes of\n\nhis department that they should not disclose, directly or indirectly, their sources. I have to\n\nreject those evidence which I heard; they were of no probative value except that they were hearsay\n\nand double hearsay which were highly damaging against the plaintiffs who would not have a chance to\n\ncross examine and scrutinise the evidence. I have set out in a sealed envelope what he told me for\n\nthe exclusive perusal of the Court of Appeal should this case go further.37 Bachar placed a lot of emphasis on the changes to the numerous serial numbers\n\nof the goods. Many of them were poorly done. Later, he checked with the manufacturers and discovered\n\nthat within each product was a mother board where the genuine number could be seen. From beginning\n\nto end, the plaintiffs and Bhojwani had consistently denied that they had carried out any of the\n\nchanges to the serial numbers of the products. In this trial, the plaintiffs led evidence from\n\nindependent witnesses and their evidence proved that the serial nos. of the JVC VCRs in 600 were not\n\nchanged by the plaintiffs. I accept the evidence of Lim Joo Kiang, an employee of AOL who were at\n\nthe material times the managers of Shankars Emporium Pte Ltd. He was involved personally in the\n\nloading at the plaintiffs warehouse at 80 Teck Guan Street of two consignments of electronic\n\ngoods, viz 800 sets of National Video cassette recorders and 600 sets of JVC. Lim said any changes\n\non that massive scale would have required a lot more space and a number of days. He did not see any\n\nsuch operations. I am satisfied that the plaintiffs did not tamper with the serial numbers of the\n\ngoods in those two consignments.38 In respect of the serial numbers of 700 cartons of CTVs supplied by World\n\nAudio they were changed. Bhojwani and industry witnesses have said that basically there were three\n\nreasons for changes in the serial numbers. First, a sole agent who has excess stock may want to\n\nclear his excess stock by selling the goods in places to which he may be prohibited under his\n\ncontract to sell to. Secondly, agents may want to mask the serial nos. of the manufacturer to make\n\nit more difficult for buyers to make frivolous claims. Thirdly, changing of serial nos. will prevent\n\ndetection of sales to unauthorised destinations. I accept that any one of these reasons could well\n\nhave been the cause for the changes in the serial nos. of the CTVs. One central plank or primary\n\nfact on which Bachar and hence the Israeli court relied on was the inference that the plaintiffs\n\nmust have changed the serial nos. They did not. Accordingly, one of the central planks grounding the\n\nfinding that the plaintiffs themselves must have changed the serial nos. as part of the act of\n\nillegally assisting in the smuggling of the electronic goods was shown to be flawed.39 Bachar also found \"astonishing\" that Bhojwani did not have the\n\nserial numbers of the 2,100 cartons of electronic goods. As was stated and reiterated by KWP at the\n\nearly stage of the investigation, the plaintiffs exported 3,000 to 4,000 of the sets every month. It\n\nwas impossible for them to do an individual computation of serial nos. on individual sets. I found\n\nthis answer a perfectly credible explanation. Mr Athappan, the CEO of the defendants in Singapore,\n\nreferred to a number of features in the transactions which he said were not told to him. One had to\n\nbe fair; the plaintiffs were themselves finding out some of the features as they investigated\n\nfurther through their lawyers and by themselves. Indeed, the defendants had advanced the plaintiffs\n\ncase to their re-insurers. It is wholly undesirable for defendants to speak from two ends of their\n\nmouth.",
        "The claims under The Agreement": "40 Notwithstanding the finding that the plaintiffs were innocent of any\n\ncomplicity in the smuggling, their claims under the Agreement for breaches will now have to be\n\nconsidered.41 I set out the terms of the Agreement in its entirety:\"AN AGREEMENT made between INDIA INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE PTE LTD\n\n  (hereinafter called \"the Company\") of 64 Cecil Street, IOB Building, Singapore 0104 and\n\n  SHERRIDON EXIM PTE LTD (hereinafter called \"the Insured\") of #06-04 High Street Plaza,\n\n  77 High Street, Singapore 0617.Whereas a Marine Cargo Policy of Insurance No.C177905 (hereinafter called\n\n  \"the Policy\") has been issued to the Insured and a claim has been made by the Insured\n\n  thereunder the parties hereto have agreed as follows:In consideration of the Company advancing a sum of US Dollar Six Hundred and\n\n  Sixty One Thousand Eight Hundred And Seventy Only (US$661,870/-) being the insured sum under the\n\n  Policy at the request of the Insured in respect of the cargo insured under the Policy carried in\n\n  Vessel \"Zim Piraeus\" which sailed on or about 15thDecember 1990 on a voyage\n\n  from Singapore to Ashdod (Israel) pending the outcome of investigations carried out by the Company\n\n  in respect of the Companys liability to indemnify the Insured under the Policy and the cause\n\n  and nature of the alleged loss under the Policy the parties to this Agreement hereby agree as\n\n  follows:-1. The said insured sum of US$661,870.00 under the Policy advanced by the\n\n    Company to the Insured is made without any admission of liability whatsoever by the Company and\n\n    without prejudice to any rights of the Company to repudiate its liability to indemnify the\n\n    Insured under the Policy in the event that the Company is shown not to be liable to indemnify\n\n    the Insured herein whereupon the Company reserves its rights to recover from the Insured the\n\n    full insured sum of US$661,870.00 together with the interests and costs in respect thereof.2. If at the conclusion of the Companys investigations herein it is found\n\n    by the Company that the Company is not liable to indemnify the Insured under the Policy the\n\n    Company shall notify the Insured of its repudiation of the claim under the Policy and shall\n\n    furnish to the Insured on an entirely without prejudice basis the grounds thereof to enable the\n\n    Insured to decide whether or not to commence legal proceedings against the Company to dispute\n\n    the repudiation under the Policy; Provided always that such proceedings must be commenced by the\n\n    Insured in the Courts of Singapore within three (3) months from the date of the repudiation\n\n    herein; Provided also that the parties to the Agreement herein shall irrevocably submit to the\n\n    jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore and the Judgement of the Courts of Singapore as regards\n\n    the Companys liability and quantum of the claim payable under the Policy shall be binding on\n\n    the Company and the Insured.3. If the Courts of Singapore were to adjudge that the Company is not liable\n\n    to indemnify the Insured under the Policy or if the Insured fails to commence legal proceedings\n\n    to dispute the Companys repudiation under the Policy as provided under the aforesaid\n\n    Condition 2 of the Agreement herein the Insured unconditionally undertakes to return the entire\n\n    insured sum of US$661,870.00 paid by the Company to the Insured under the Policy together with\n\n    interests payable at the average of the prevailing term deposit rates of the 4 major local banks\n\n    ie. OCBC, UOB, OUB and DBS from the date of receipt of the said insured sum by the Insured and\n\n    costs awarded by the Courts of Singapore in respect of legal proceedings, if commenced, and this\n\n    payment of the said insured sum shall be made by the Insured to the Company within fourteen (14)\n\n    days from the date of final judgement or upon the expiry of three (3) months from the date of\n\n    the Companys repudiation hereof where the Insured had failed to commence legal proceedings to\n\n    dispute such repudiation.4. In the event that the Company is found liable by the Courts of Singapore\n\n    to indemnify the Insured under the Policy the payment herein of the said insured sum of\n\n    US$661,870.00 by the Company to the Insured shall be deemed to be full and final settlement of\n\n    the Companys liability under the Policy. Notwithstanding this, the Company agrees to pay the\n\n    costs awarded by the Courts of Singapore in respect of the claim herein.5. In the absence of any written repudiation of the claim herein from the\n\n    Company within three (3) years from the date hereof or upon the expiry of ninety (90) days from\n\n    the date of final judgement of Israeli Courts in the criminal proceedings brought by the Customs\n\n    Authorities in Israel in connection with the cargo insured herein, whichever is later, the\n\n    Companys rights to repudiate the said claim shall be extinguished and the amount paid herein\n\n    shall constitute full and final settlement of the Companys liability under the Policy.6. This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of Singapore and shall be\n\n    subject to the jurisdiction of the Courts of Singapore.\"",
        "New Agreement": "42 I refer to the defendants closing submissions in paras 146 to 151. The\n\nbackground leading to the Agreement, as pointed out, was the decision of the Haifa District Court\n\nimplicating the plaintiffs in the smuggling. By their letter of 15 January 1996 the plaintiffs\n\noffered to terminate the Agreement by repaying the money in return for the advantage of not having\n\nto sue within what they thought was the 3 month time limit for bringing action for wrongful\n\nrepudiation. It was obviously advantageous to the plaintiffs to have more time to consider what to\n\ndo, whether to appeal and so forth. Bhojwani in evidence admitted that there were benefits to the\n\nplaintiffs to return the money without prejudice to their rights under the policy. The plaintiffs\n\noffer was accepted by the defendants by their subsequent conduct, which was to accept the tender of\n\nthe money and to have asked and accepted the interest. I agree with the submission that on a correct\n\nanalysis a new agreement was formed to revert to the position under the original All Risks marine\n\ncargo policy. By the new agreement reached, it was reasonably clear that the intention was that the\n\npolicy, and not the Agreement, would be the basis for any future legal action by way of claims under\n\nor repudiation of the policy. The plaintiffs did not sue under the policy but left it too late to do\n\nso. They could have protected their position by obtaining prior to 6 March 1998 an extension of time\n\nfrom the defendants. KWPs letter of 26 November 1997 was a trifling late in attempting to\n\npreserve the plaintiffs rights under the Agreement. Accordingly, in my judgment the plaintiffs\n\nclaims under the Agreement are not maintainable.43 I turn to the defences of waiver by election and the defence of approbation\n\nand reprobation. Both defences are, in my view, subsumed by my conclusion that a new agreement had\n\nreplaced the Agreement. As was pointed out inEvans v Bartlam[1937] All England Law Reports\n\nAnnotated p.646: \"The foundation of the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is that the\n\nperson against whom it is applied has accepted a benefit from the matter he reprobates.\" On any\n\nview, the plaintiffs had elected by offering quite clearly to revert to their rights under their All\n\nRisks marine cargo policy and had enjoyed among others the benefits of additional time that was\n\nreceived in exchange. They must now stand by their election and approbation; indeed the plaintiffs\n\nwent further and agreed to revert to the rights under the policy. As for the defence of waiver by\n\nestoppel, this was not sufficiently pleaded with adequate particulars. It is therefore not\n\nconsidered.",
        "Other claims of defendants": "44 I further turn to the claims of unjust enrichment and for money had and\n\nreceived to the plaintiffs use. They do not arise for consideration in view of the new agreement.\n\nAs stated earlier, the plaintiffs offered to return the money paid to them under the Agreement and\n\nlater even the interest in return for their rights under the All Risks marine cargo policy. There is\n\naccordingly no unjust factor or enrichment; nor were there any wrongful repudiation of the Agreement\n\nby the defendants under those two heads of claims in restitution. Even if the defendants had\n\ndemanded the return of the money following the decision of the Haifa District Court against the\n\nplaintiffs, the latter could have insisted on exercising their rights under the Agreement. They\n\ncould then sue under the policy within the agreed time limit and in the meantime hold on to the\n\nmoney. Instead, they wanted and bought more time which, very unfortunately, was exceeded resulting\n\nin the time bar setting in against any claim under the policy.45 Additionally, in respect of the plaintiffs claim for money had and received\n\nto their use they rely on the alleged common mistake. For them to succeed under this part of their\n\ncase they have to establish unknown to both parties that the demand for the return of the money was\n\nmade outside the time prescribed in clause 5.46 Clause 5 of the Agreement reads:\"5. In the absence of any written repudiation of the claim herein from the\n\n  Company within three (3) years from the date hereof or upon the expiry of ninety (90) days from\n\n  the date of final judgement of Israeli Courts in the criminal proceedings brought by the Customs\n\n  Authorities in Israel in connection with the cargo insured herein, whichever is later, the Companys\n\n  rights to repudiate the said claim shall be extinguished and the amount paid herein shall\n\n  constitute full and final settlement of the Companys liability under the Policy.\"47 The burden was on the plaintiffs to prove that the 90 days in clause 5 runs\n\n\"from the date of thefinalJudgment of Israeli Courts in the criminal proceedings\n\nbrought by the Customs Authorities in Israel.\" (emphasis added). As was foreshadowed earlier in\n\nthis judgment, there is unchallenged evidence before this court that Avi Cohen appealed against the\n\ndecision of Judge Gross. The judge himself referred to an appeal in para 7. It was unsustainable for\n\nthe plaintiffs to maintain that 90 days would run from 20 April 1993 which was only the decision of\n\nthe court of first instance. It was not a \"final\" judgment within the meaning of clause 5.",
        "The counterclaim": "48 At the request of the plaintiffs the defendants advanced to them the costs and\n\nexpenses incurred and to be incurred in the Israeli proceedings. Athappan \"was agreeable to the\n\nidea so long as the advances were without prejudice to policy liability and provided the plaintiffs\n\nagreed to repay the defendants if the claim was declined\": see para 734 of defendants\n\nclosing submissions. The defendants issued to them the July Indemnity. It reads:\"In consideration of your agreeing to pay the legal expenses incurred up\n\n  to now and undertaking the responsibility for future legal expenses in respect of the legal\n\n  actions initiated by us against the Shipping Company, Port/Customs Authorities in connection with\n\n  the goods confiscated or seized by the Customs Authority in Ashdod, and in respect of the\n\n  consignment insured under your Policy No. C177905 consisting of 2100 cartons electronic goods (800\n\n  sets National NV-L-15EN, 600 sets JVC VCR HR-D1540A and 700 sets JVC CTV C-1480M) and insured for\n\n  US$611,870 (the said policy) without first ascertaining the liability under the policy for\n\n  the alleged loss, we Sherridon Exim Pte Ltd holder of the said insurance policy hereby guarantee\n\n  to pay to you upon your written notice, the amount of legal expenses you have incurred in respect\n\n  of the abovementioned legal actions including costs and expenses, on the condition that we shall\n\n  be liable to pay to you the sameonly in the event that you are legally entitled to repudiate\n\n  all liability under the said policy. (Italics added)This letter of guarantee is irrevocable and would remain in full force until\n\n  the matter is fully resolved and will be valid even if we contest your repudiation of claim under\n\n  the said policy until such time as a Court adjudges or it is agreed between the parties that the\n\n  repudiation is valid.\"49 The italicised clause sets out the intention that the defendants would be\n\nobliged to indemnify the plaintiffs if there is a successful repudiation of all liability under the\n\npolicy. That the defendants were implicated in the smuggling, for example, would be a lawful\n\nrepudiation of liability under the policy. But in this case, the fact of the matter was that\n\nunfortunately the plaintiffs lost the right to sue under the policy because of the time bar. The\n\nloss had nothing to do with the terms of and any repudiation \"under the policy\". No\n\nrepudiation of the policy by the defendants was involved. The pre-condition in my view is not\n\nsatisfied and the defendants are unable to claim on the July 1991 indemnity.",
        "Conclusions": "50 For these reasons, the plaintiffs claims and the defendants counterclaim\n\nin this action are all dismissed. I now turn to the question of costs. The evidence and arguments in\n\nrelation to the defendants allegation that the plaintiffs were implicated in the smuggling took\n\nup a substantial part of the days allocated to this trial. The defendants failed on this issue. They\n\nalso fail in their claim on the July 1991 Indemnity. On the other hand, the plaintiffs failed in all\n\ntheir claims. In the exercise of my discretion I would make no order as to costs.",
