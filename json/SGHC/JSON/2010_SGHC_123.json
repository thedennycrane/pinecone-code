        "MA 293 of 2009": "8       In MA 293 of 2009, the appellant,\n                    Singh had kicked a bus captain when told by the latter to pay the bus fare. Upon\n                    his plea of guilt, Singh was convicted by the DJ and sentenced to a four-week\n                    imprisonment term. His appeal was against the sentence. 9       Singh was 45 years old and the victim, the bus\n                    captain Yap Eyu Kiong (“Yap”) was 56 years of age. The agreed\n                    statement of facts states as follows: 4    On 16/02/2009 at about 10.31 pm, at Blk 206\n                            Mars[i]ling Drive Bus stop, complainant called for police informing that\n                            “I am the bus driver of 903, TIBS, there is this driver here\n                            giving me problem. We stopped at the bus stop. Please send your men here\n                            now.” 5    Investigation revealed that on 16/02/2009 at about\n                            10.13 pm, complainant was driving bus service number 903 registration\n                            number: TIB1193C from Woodlands Regional Interchange. He drove to the\n                            designated berth to allow passengers to board and the accused was the\n                            last to board the said bus. Complainant then started to drive the bus\n                            and he noticed that the accused did not pay for the bus fare and he\n                            walked pas[t] the driver’s seat and sat on a seat near to the\n                            complainant. 6    Investigation further revealed that during the\n                            journey, the complainant stopped at the Blk 19 Marsiling Lane bus stop\n                            and he asked the accused to pay for the bus fare but he remained quiet.\n                            After the passengers have alighted at this bus stop, complainant closed\n                            the door and continued with the bus journey. At the next bus stop, which\n                            was Blk 206 Mars[i]ling Drive, complainant once again asked the accused\n                            to pay the bus fare and the accused aggressively scolded the\n                            complainant. Thereafter, the accused kicked complainant once on his left\n                            leg. Complainant immediately called for police assistance. 7    Investigation also revealed that at the time of\n                            incident, the witness also saw the accused kicking the\n                            complainant’s left leg. 8    Complainant was examined by Dr Lee Biing Ming\n                            Simon on 17thFebruary 2009 from 1054\n                            hrs to 1106 hrs at Woodlands Polyclinic. Complainant was diagnosed to\n                            have sustained a contusion on the left leg/calf. 10     In mitigation, counsel for Singh, Mr S K\n                    Kumar (“Mr Kumar”), stated that Singh had pleaded guilty\n                    thereby saving the Court’s time and resources; that Singh was married with\n                    three children; that he was the main breadwinner supporting the family and had\n                    cooperated with the police and was a first offender. 11     In his grounds of decision\n                    (“GD”), the DJ cited extensively from the decision of the High\n                    Court inWong Hoi Len(see [9] of GD). The DJ\n                    concurred with the Court’s observation therein that public transport\n                    workers were more vulnerable to criminal violence than other public transport\n                        workers.[note: 3]The cited extracts\n                    also highlighted that in other jurisdictions there has been found a need to\n                    impose deterrent sentences to protect public transport workers and that it is an\n                    aggravating factor where the victim is a public transport worker. One of the\n                    extracts alluded to the case ofPublic Prosecutor v Law Aik\n                        Meng[2007] 2 SLR(R) 814 which the Court inWong Hoi Lenpointed out that it was decided in that\n                    case that where an offence involved a vulnerable victim or affected the\n                    provision of a public service, general deterrence should assume special\n                    significance and relevance. Policy considerations, the Court inWong Hoi Lenobserved, applied with equal, if not\n                    greater, force than in the case of road rage offences where the victim of an\n                    offence was a public transport worker. The Court inWong Hoi\n                        Lenproposed a sentencing benchmark of around four weeks’\n                    jail for a “simple assault” against a public transport worker\n                    where the offender had no antecedents and had pleaded guilty to a charge under\n                    s 323 of the Penal Code. The DJ remarked that a “clear\n                    message” had to be delivered that violence against public transport\n                    workers would not be condoned and that such public transport workers had\n                    “every right to work in a safe and secure environment” (at [10]).\n                    In the premises, he sentenced Singh to four weeks’\n                imprisonment. 12     Before me, Mr Kumar submitted that the\n                    mitigation plea had not been accorded the weight it deserved; that the kick was\n                    spontaneous as opposed to pre-meditated and that the injuries caused by Singh\n                    were very minor and would thus warrant the operation of s 95 of the Penal\n                    Code. Mr Kumar submitted that the circumstances leading to the offence was\n                    at variance with that in the agreed statement of facts (“ASOF”).\n                    However he conceded that as counsel for Singh in the hearing below, he had not\n                    resolved these discrepancies between the ASOF and mitigation plea. Indeed, he\n                    had not objected to the ASOF at the hearing below. Neither did he ask for a\n                    Newton hearing. There had only been one amendment sought by Singh even though it\n                    was open to him to challenge anything in the statement of facts. In any event, I\n                    found that the facts which were disputed at the appellate stage were irrelevant.\n                    In the circumstances, I proceeded with the appeal on the basis of the\n                    ASOF. 13     The material elements of the case are as\n                    follows. Singh boarded the bus at around 10pm. He did not pay the bus fare and\n                    yet had the temerity to sit near Yap. When Yap asked him a second time to pay\n                    the bus fare, he started aggressively scolding Yap and then walked up to him and\n                    gave him a kick. As Mr Kumar conceded before me, Yap was only trying to do\n                    his job and had not gone about it in an obnoxious manner. 14     What makes offences against public transport\n                    workers so repugnant is the exploitation of their vulnerability. The nature and\n                    degree of vulnerability of taxi drivers, bus captains, and other public\n                    transport workers may vary across the transport modes, but it is undisputed that\n                    the multi-faceted risks faced by all of them by virtue of their job makes them\n                    more vulnerable than other professions. In this case, Singh’s offence was\n                    especially reprehensible as it exploited the fact that Yap, as a bus captain,\n                    had multiple tasks to perform: Yap had to ensure that commuters paid their fares\n                    while simultaneously focusing on his driving and the road, and ensuring the\n                    safety of all his passengers. All these tasks had to be performed constantly\n                    throughout the journey while driving long hours. Moreover, the offence took\n                    place at night, when it is more difficult to drive due to reduced visibility.\n                    Bus captains are without doubt, a vulnerable group of people in that they are\n                    exposed to greater risks since they have many matters to attend to\n                    simultaneously. In other words, the various demands on their attention by their\n                    responsibilities make these bus captains easy targets. They also serve a greater\n                    volume of human traffic which increases their risk of being assaulted by rogue\n                    commuters. They are also vulnerable in that it is difficult for them to fend off\n                    attacks because of where they are seatedvis-à-visthe commuters. 15     It appears to me that Singh was hoping that\n                    his dishonest act of not paying the fare would go undetected by the driver who\n                    would be too busy to notice this. When Yap asked Singh to pay up the first time,\n                    Singh simply remained silent. But when Yap asked a second time, Singh flared up\n                    and started scolding him. Singh probably felt unhappy that Yap was performing\n                    his duties so well. This incident would have, at the very least, caused\n                    inconvenience to the other commuters and when Singh kicked Yap, it would have\n                    also caused consternation and even fear to other commuters. 16     To discharge their duties efficaciously and\n                    efficiently, public transport workers need to be protected and to feel protected\n                    from all manners of violence and aggression. Bus captains have an especially\n                    onerous burden given the large number f commuters they serve everyday and the\n                    responsibilities they shoulder. In fact, last month SBS Transit announced a 15%\n                    salary increase to attract more Singaporeans into this vocation.[note: 4]The press release reported that the new monthly basic salary of $1,375 would\n                    mean that new Singaporean bus captains could earn over $1,900 every month in\n                    their first year of employment. NTUC Assistant Secretary-General and NTWU Acting\n                    Executive Secretary Mr Ong Ye Kung had this to say: A basic salary of $1,375 better reflects the scope of responsibilities of\n                        a Bus Captain, and the prevailing situation in the Singapore labour market\n                        today. It is also a clear signal from SBS Transit that driving buses safely\n                        and efficiently is a core capability of the company, and it intends to\n                        attract good Singaporean workers to do the job. NTWU will give our full\n                        support to SBS Transit to make sure that higher pay incentivises higher\n                        productivity, and higher productivity drives higher pay. This way, company\n                        and workers all benefit. 17     Indeed, given the heavy responsibilities borne\n                    by bus captains and the demands of safety and efficiency that is exacted upon\n                    them, the court should not condone any mischief by commuters who disrupt bus\n                    services and interfere with the bus captain’s discharge of his duties.A fortiori, it cannot take lightly acts of\n                    violence or aggression towards bus captains which would put the latter in fear\n                    of their personal safety and the rest of the commuters. 18     Mr Kumar attempted to invoke s 95 of\n                    the Penal Code which provides that Nothing is an offence by reason that it causes, or that it is intended to\n                        cause, or that it is known to be likely to cause, any harm, if that harm is\n                        so slight that no person of ordinary sense and temper would complain of such\n                        harm. 19     InTeo Geok Fong v Lim Eng\n                        Hock[1996] 2 SLR(R) 957 (“Teo Geok Fong”), a couple were in the midst of divorce\n                    proceedings. The wife had slapped her husband because she was annoyed with him\n                    taking photographs of her removing her belongings from the matrimonial home. She\n                    was charged and convicted of committing an offence under s 323 of the Penal\n                    Code (the penalties prescribed then were a maximum jail term of one year, or\n                    with fine which may extend to $1,000, or with both). The former Chief Justice\n                    Yong Pung How hearing the appeal observed at [50] of the judgment that: … s 95 provides relief to an offender where the act is\n                        negligible or the offence is of a trivial character … it [also]\n                        applies … where the act was deliberate. The section would apply if\n                        the act causes harm or is intended to cause harm or is known to be likely to\n                        cause harm, provided the harm is so slight that no person of ordinary sense\n                        and temper would complain of such harm. 20     Noting that the wife had administered a single\n                    slap and that there were no marks or scratches and the husband had not bothered\n                    to seek medical attention, the Court remarked that the injury must have been\n                    minor. Further, the husband had been upsetting the wife by his action. Tensions\n                    were running high in their matrimonial dispute in the courts and these factors\n                    converged to make her sufficiently upset to slap the husband.Ergo, 57 … it would not be in the interest of justice to penalise the\n                        appellant for what, in my opinion, was a negligible wrong. Although the\n                        appellant was clearly guilty of the offence, I would apply thede minimisprinciple under s 95 of the Penal\n                        Code. 21     The wife’s appeal was thus allowed but\n                    that case is far removed from the present one. Quite apart from the fact that\n                    Yap had suffered a bruise arising from the kick by Singh, the circumstances are\n                    very different.Teo Geok Fongwas in the context\n                    of a domestic dispute and as it was the wife who had hit the husband; it was not\n                    a case of one party taking advantage of its superior strength over the other\n                    party. Furthermore, although they were in the midst of a divorce, a criminal\n                    conviction arising from the incident could wreck any chance of reconciliation\n                    and certainly reduce chances of cooperation between them in relation to the care\n                    of their children. 22     In deciding on the appropriate sentence, the\n                    degree of violence visited on the victim is but one factor, important though it\n                    is. The circumstances in which the act was committed may be relevant. In the\n                    present case, Singh was in the wrong in not paying the fare, yet he behaved in a\n                    thuggish manner towards the driver who was only carrying out the job he was paid\n                    to do. Singh had taken advantage of the vulnerability of Yap for whom the most\n                    important task was to operate the bus and ensure the safety of his passengers\n                    and other road users. In addition to this important and onerous task, Yap had to\n                    see to it that persons boarding the bus should pay the fare. This was a\n                    difficult enough task to perform; yet Singh had not only acted dishonestly but\n                    had the temerity to carry out an act of physical violence. His offence has to be\n                    seen in this context. 23     People who provide public transport services\n                    perform tasks that are onerous and dangerous, particularly where they are in\n                    charge of large vehicles because the safety of a large number of persons, both\n                    in and out of the vehicle, are at stake. The law cannot and will not condone the\n                    reprehensible acts of passengers who exploit the vulnerability of public\n                    transport workers and threaten their safety and that of other\n                    passengers/commuters. The court will not hesitate to impose severe punishment to\n                    serve as a general deterrence in appropriate cases. This appeal is one such case\n                    in which a deterrent sentence is warranted. 24     For the foregoing reasons, I found that the\n                    sentence of four weeks’ imprisonment was not manifestly excessive and\n                    dismissed Singh’s appeal.",
        "MA 300 of 2009": "25     In the second appeal, MA\n                    300 of 2009, the appellant, Taniguchi, had also pleaded guilty to a\n                    charge under s 323 of the Penal Code. The victim was a 65 year old taxi\n                    driver Lim Hing Soon (“Lim”). The relevant parts of the agreed\n                    statement of facts tendered to the court below are as follows: 3.    On 2 September\n                            2008 at or about 12.40am, an unknown male caller informed the [police]\n                            that a “taxi driver is assaulted here and we have detained the\n                            assailant. Please send the police and ambulance.” The incident\n                            location was given as the main road in front of Block 105B Edgefield\n                            Plains, Singapore. 4.    Investigations revealed that on 2 September 2008, just after\n                            midnight, the accused boarded the victim’s taxi along Orchard\n                            Road. The accused smelt strongly of alcohol. The accused showed the\n                            victim an address on his mobile phone, Block 126 Edgefield Plains\n                            Singapore. The victim thus drove to Punggol Estate; however, he was\n                            unable to find Block 126. 5.    This\n                            angered the accused who informed the victim that he would not pay the\n                            taxi fare as the victim was unable to find the correct block. The\n                            accused instructed the victim to stop by the side of the\n                        road. 6.    The victim stopped in front\n                            of Block 105B Edgefield Plains, Singapore. The accused alighted from the\n                            taxi without paying the taxi fare. The victim therefore followed the\n                            accused to collect his taxi fare. The accused pushed the\n                        victim. 7.    The victim returned to his\n                            taxi and retrieved an umbrella. The accused grabbed the umbrella and a\n                            tussle ensued. During the tussle, the victim fell to the floor. However,\n                            the tussle for control of the umbrella continued. In the course of this\n                            tussle, the victim suffered\n                            injuries. 8.    The victim was\n                            subsequently conveyed to Changi General Hospital by ambulance. The\n                            medical report dated 16 October 2008 stated that the victim suffered the\n                            following injuries: a.    a 7 cm laceration over the\n                            forehead; b.    left upper thigh wound; and c.    tenderness over the left anterior chest\n                                wall. Intramuscular anti tetanus (IM ATT) injection was administered. The wounds\n                        over the forehead and thigh were cleaned and closed with sutures. The victim\n                        was discharged and given three days medical leave. 26     The relevant parts of Taniguchi’s\n                    mitigation plea state as follows: 3.    On the night in question, the Accused was out with\n                            a friend at a pub. Some time on or around midnight, the Accused headed\n                            home in the taxi driven by Lim. At that time, the Accused was feeling\n                            very tired (having worked the entire day) and drowsy from the effects of\n                            alcohol. 4.    The Accused told Lim to head for Edgefield Plains\n                            in Sengkang. 5.    Due to the fact the Accused spoke English with a\n                            strong Japanese accent, he was worried that the taxi-driver would not be\n                            able to understand him clearly. The Accused therefore showed Lim his\n                            home address stored in his mobile phone. This address stored on the\n                            mobile phone is Blk 126A #08-334, Edgedale Plains, Singapore\n                            821126. 6.    Though the taxi-driver managed to get to Punggol,\n                            he was unable to locate the Accused’s block. 7.    The Accused was not able to offer meaningful\n                            directions to the taxi driver as he had only relocated to the address\n                            two weeks earlier. Moreover, he was not fluent in English. It did not\n                            help that the Accused was also at that time rather drowsy and very\n                            tired. 8.    As Lim kept circling around aimlessly in his taxi,\n                            the Accused asked Lim several times to call the taxi company to seek\n                            directions as this is some thing which a taxi-driver in Japan would have\n                            done readily. Unfortunately, Lim did not oblige and continued to try to\n                            find the address himself. The taxi driver stopped the car 4 times to ask\n                            to see the address on the Accused’s handphone. 9.    Out of desperation and at his wit’s end, the\n                            Accused eventually told Lim that if he continued to drive around\n                            aimlessly and not ask the taxi company for directions, the Accused would\n                            not pay for the taxi fare. 10.    Unfortunately, on hearing this, Lim became rather\n                            agitated. He started shouting at the Accused. The Accused also became\n                            angry and asked Lim to stop the taxi. 11.    When the taxi stopped, the Accused got out of the\n                            taxi as he was by then extremely angry with the poor service he was\n                            getting and simply wanted to get away from the\n                        taxi-driver. 12.    The taxi-driver then went after the Accused. The\n                            taxi-driver continued to shout loudly and rudely at the Accused. When\n                            Lim eventually caught up with the Accused and grabbed him, the Accused\n                            pushed him away. 13.    Lim then returned to his taxi to get an\n                            umbrella. 14.    On seeing this, the Accused – still in his\n                            tired and drowsy state – felt that the taxi-driver might have\n                            wanted to use the umbrella on him. He instinctively tried to seize the\n                            umbrella from Lim. 15.    A brief struggle then ensued between the two men\n                            as both tried to seize control of the umbrella. In the process, Lim fell\n                            to the ground but the tussle for control of the umbrella continued. All\n                            the time, Lim continued to shout at the Accused. 16.    The Accused stopped when he saw that the tip of\n                            the umbrella had caused a cut on Lim’s forehead. 17.    An ambulance and the police subsequently arrived\n                            though the Accused is not certain as to who had called for them. Lim\n                            walked to the ambulance and was subsequently not seen by the Accused\n                            again. After clarifying the events with the police at the scene, the\n                            Accused left with a friend whom he called to come to get\n                        him. 27     The learned deputy submitted that Taniguchi\n                    had pushed Lim which was why Lim had retrieved the umbrella – he had\n                    feared further attack from Taniguchi. She also pointed out that Taniguchi was an\n                    intoxicated offender, a larger man than Lim and that even when Lim fell to the\n                    ground, the tussle continued when Taniguchi could have stopped. She averred that\n                    the assault was sustained even though it was not brutish as inWong Hoi Len. Submitting that no violence against public\n                    transport workers should be condoned and that Taniguchi had not wanted to pay\n                    the victim, the prosecution observed that the defence’s authority ofPublic Prosecutor v Andrew Bevan Jones[2008] SGDC 115 (“Andrew Bevan\n                        Jones”) wherein the accused was fined for assaulting a\n                    taxi driver had been decided beforeWong Hoi\n                    Len. 28     In his GD, the DJ noted that the injuries\n                    sustained by Lim were closed by sutures and concluded that these injuries were\n                    not “superficial cuts” but were “sufficiently\n                    serious” to require stitching. He also noted that Lim was given medical\n                    leave of four days. He further observed that it was agreed that Taniguchi had\n                    smelt strongly of alcohol at the material time and that Taniguchi’s\n                    counsel (“Miss Tan”) had not disputed the prosecution’s\n                    submission that Lim was smaller in built than Taniguchi. Adverting toWong Hoi Len, the DJ noted the principle therein that\n                    intoxication was an aggravating factor and considered that Taniguchi had indeed\n                    been intoxicated thereby aggravating his misdemeanour. A further aggravating\n                    factor was that Taniguchi had continued to tussle for the umbrella even when Lim\n                    had fell to the ground, and only desisted when he saw that the tip of the\n                    umbrella had cut Lim’s forehead. The DJ pointed out that Taniguchi could\n                    have ceased struggling for the umbrella when Lim fell to the ground (at [11] of\n                    the GD). The DJ considered it yet another aggravating factor, the fact that Lim\n                    at the material time was an “elderly man” of 65 years of age and\n                    smaller in size than Taniguchi ([12] of GD). The DJ alluded to the Court’s\n                    remarks inWong Hoi Lenwhere at [12] of the said\n                    judgment the Court had observed that New South Wales legislation provided that\n                    where the victim is vulnerable (egelderly or a\n                    public transport worker), this would constitute an aggravating factor. The DJ\n                    added that although local legislation did not expressly provide for this, a\n                    victim’s advanced years would “generally be an aggravating factor\n                    in cases of assault.” 29     The DJ noted Miss Tan’s submission in\n                    the mitigation plea that Taniguchi thought that Lim might use the umbrella on\n                    him. However it would appear that the DJ was more inclined towards the\n                    prosecution’s submission that Lim had taken out the umbrella because he\n                    was fearful that Taniguchi would further attack him. He also said that there had\n                    been no allegation that Lim had attempted to attack Taniguchi with the umbrella\n                    and noted that the latter had not sustained any injury. Of\n                    “critical” importance to the DJ ([14] of GD) was Taniguchi’s\n                    conduct after Lim had fallen to the ground. The DJ remarked that Taniguchi could\n                    have stopped once Lim fell but chose to continue tussling for the umbrella\n                    instead. The DJ also dismissed other aspects of the mitigation plea such as the\n                    language barrier between Lim and Taniguchi and Lim’s refusal to call the\n                    taxi company for assistance. He pointedly remarked at [15] of his GD\n                    that: … A taxi driver’s inability to find the address of a\n                        passenger cannot be used as an excuse by the passenger to assault the taxi\n                        driver. Similarly, difficulties in communication arising from language\n                        barriers cannot be a mitigating factor in our cosmopolitan country ...\n                        Disputes arising from such language barriers should never give rise to an\n                        assault by the customer against the service provider or vice versa. 30     As for the case ofAndrew\n                        Bevan Jones, the DJ found that it was to be confined to its own\n                    facts. Having reference to the four-week benchmark inWong\n                        Hoi Len, the DJ ruled that the present case was indeed\n                    distinguishable from the former insofar as the severity of the assault was\n                    concerned. He found that the present case did not involve a sustained and\n                    brutish assault unlikeWong Hoi Lenand hence a\n                    sentence closer to the starting benchmark should be imposed. Having regard to\n                    the aggravating factorsviz, the intoxication of\n                    Taniguchi; his continued tussle for the umbrella even after Lim had fallen to\n                    the ground and that Lim was elderly, the DJ was of the view that six\n                    weeks’ imprisonment was an appropriate sentence. 31     In my view, the crucial error made by the DJ\n                    was his failure to appreciate that Taniguchi had not intended to cause the\n                    injury. This is clear from para 7 of the statement of facts which states\n                    that Taniguchi had “grabbed the umbrella and a tussle ensued. During the\n                    tussle, the victim fell to the floor. However, the tussle for control of the\n                    umbrella continued. In the course of this tussle, the victim suffered\n                    injuries.” This is confirmed in the mitigation plea, which was not\n                    opposed by the prosecution, in which Miss Tan had stated that when Lim returned\n                    with the umbrella, Taniguchi had felt that it might be used to attack him and he\n                    tried to seize it from Lim. It was in the course of the struggle for control of\n                    the umbrella that Lim’s head was cut with the tip of the umbrella. It is\n                    necessary to examine whether it was reasonable for Taniguchi to apprehend that\n                    Lim might use the umbrella on him. The circumstances were these: Taniguchi had\n                    an altercation with Lim on the poor quality of the taxi service and refused to\n                    pay him. As Taniguchi walked away from the taxi, Lim went up to him to ask for\n                    payment. Taniguchi responded by pushing Lim away. Lim then returned to the taxi,\n                    took an umbrella from it, and went up to Taniguchi, umbrella in hand. Now there\n                    is no indication that the reason for Lim getting out the umbrella was because he\n                    thought that it was about to rain. Unfortunately there is also no indication of\n                    the size of the umbrella. However, the fact is that Taniguchi apprehended that\n                    Lim might use the umbrella on him and this is consistent with the preceding\n                    facts. Therefore Taniguchi, in trying to grab the umbrella, did so to prevent it\n                    being used on him. However, Taniguchi did not plead that his acts were carried\n                    out in exercise of his right to private defence under s 96 of the Penal\n                    Code and it is not necessary to examine whether he had exceeded that right.\n                    Indeed he had pleaded guilty to the present charge. However the fact that his\n                    act was motivated by his apprehension that the umbrella might be used against\n                    him is an important factor to be taken into consideration in\n                sentencing. 32     While Taniguchi might be considered wrong in\n                    refusing to pay Lim the taxi fare, it cannot be said his grievance was not\n                    genuine. This is quite unlike the appeal in MA 293 of 2009 in which\n                    the appellant, Singh, was deliberately avoiding paying the bus fare and when he\n                    was caught by the victim, had the temerity to give him a kick. In\n                    Taniguchi’s case, he was all the time trying to get away from Lim and it\n                    was the latter who was following him. And when Taniguchi pushed him away, he\n                    went and armed himself with an umbrella. Even if this was motivated by a fear of\n                    being attacked by the larger man, it cannot be said that Taniguchi was\n                    unreasonable to apprehend that it was intended to be used against him. It was\n                    therefore not entirely unreasonable for Taniguchi to try to snatch it away from\n                    Lim. It should be noted that Taniguchi did not deliberately set out to inflict\n                    hurt on Lim and the latter was injured only in the course of the tussle for the\n                    umbrella. Taking these circumstances into account, it was clear that the\n                    sentence of six weeks’ imprisonment was manifestly excessive; a fine would\n                    have been the appropriate punishment for Taniguchi. I therefore reduced the\n                    sentence to a fine of $2,000.",
        "Conclusion": "33     InAbu Syeed Chowdhury v\n                        Public Prosecutor[2002] 1 SLR(R) 182, Yong Pung\n                    How CJ said at [15] that a benchmark is but a … sentencing norm prevailing on the mind of every judge, ensuring\n                        consistency and therefore fairness in a criminal justice system. It is not\n                        cast in stone, nor does it represent an abdication of the judicial\n                        prerogative to tailor criminal sanctions to the individual offender. It\n                        instead provides the focal point against which sentences in subsequent\n                        cases, with differing degrees of criminal culpability, can be accurately\n                        determined. … Therefore in considering the appropriate sentence in any case, the\n                    benchmark is only a starting point. It is incumbent on the sentencing judge to\n                    distil the important factors of the case and the weight to be given to each of\n                    them in determining the appropriate sentence to be meted out. The two present\n                    appeals provide useful contrasting illustrations of this process.
